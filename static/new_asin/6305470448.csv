1032561,5,6305470448,"OK, first of all a confession: I haven't seen the DVD (nor the video), but I will.  I HAVE seen the film and find it one of the most enjoyable and extraordinary movies ever produced.  The film is a joyful examination of  love, Elizibethan theater, and a delightful speculation on Shakespeare's  creative process.  The filming is breathtakingly beautiful; the actors'  performances (all of them) are exemplary for their clarity, wonderful  timing, and tremendous energy.  The film is unique because of the way it  communicates a love of theater and theater history.  Obviously, not  everyone loves this film, but I am so happy that it was made.  I  particularly enjoyed how the real people of Elizabethan theater were  provided with characterizations that motivated and infused them with  amazing vitality (such as the brilliant, comic, moment when Webster admits  that he particularly liked TITUS ANDRONICUS).  SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is a  treasure.",929145600,,946,5.23489932885906
1032562,4,6305470448,"A clever film and understandably successful at the box office. I discuss it at length in two essays, both in book collections, one edited by Don Hedrick and Bryan Reynolds entitled _Dissident Shakespeare_ (New York: St.  Martin's Press, 2000) and the other entitled _Shakespeare, Film, Fin de  Sicele_, edited by Mark Thornton Burnett and Ramona Wray (London:  Macmillan, 2000).",928540800,,378,5.372881355932203

1032677,5,6305470448,Wonderful. Great the way Will's words were written on screen. as sometimes you have to read them to fully understand. This flick and Brothers Grimm involved Harvey Weinstein.

1032807,5,6305470448,"A Shakespeare drama wrapped in a Shakespearean plot with great acting, gorgeous set, colors, and sound track -- laced with enough British humor and sight gags to keep it light and remind you that this is supposed to be fun, not heavy. That said, the acting in the Romeo and Juliet scenes was great and the cast offers enough familiar faces that you'll chuckle at the contrast with some of their recent roles. My favorite was Jim Carter (aka Mr Carson in Downton Abbey). Thoroughly enjoyable, highly recommended. Rent the HD version -- the visuals are worth it.",1496707200,,560,4.724489795918367

1032876,5,6305470448,"OMG, the COLORS !  The TEXTURES.  This is a rom-com, entertaining, now terribly deep, but the camera work and the set details are worth the price of admission.  As is the state of Queen Elizabeth's teeth.. (What is it about the English and taking care of their teeth?)",1490572800,2,268,4.541666666666667
1032877,5,6305470448,"Young Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) feels utterly defeated.  He's museless, wordless, and he's sold a non-existent play to 2 competing playhouses.  He's up the Elizabethan creek, and I can't recall if this is a day for his standing therapy appointment. Weekly psychotherapy sessions are just one of the wonderful anachronistic modern-day constructs inserted into this marvel of a movie, set in 1593 London. One very famous play then begins, as a mockery of itself-- ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.""  The Queen (Judi Dench) has a predilection for humor, definitely not love plays.  When auditions begin for the skeleton play,  Thomas Kent (Gwyneth Paltrow in men's guise), steps up.  Will is awed by his talent.  A mandate of the era makes it unlawful for a woman to appear on a public stage. All women are played by men.  (A quick aside: ""Stage Beauty"" on Prime, skillfully zeroes in on this subject).  There are many ingenious parodied and paradoxical representations of that requirement throughout. We know from the start  that Viola De Lesseps (playing Kent playing...)  is the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and a young woman with a passion to act.  This is when the other passion is unleashed, and Will and Viola are enraptured and their lovemaking is just plain gorgeous and hot.  And thus the true play begins, as this pairing begins to breathe life and form into it. The rest remains to be seen. Always reluctant to use the ""p"" word, I must in this instance --- it's perfect. The acting is brilliant by all, obviously the 2 leads, but also Rush, Wilkinson, Dench, all. The writing, directing, filming, editing, art direction, costumes, all filmmaking disciplines, are precisely in sync and dazzling.  The screenplay (Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard) incorporates exquisite prose, poetry, excerpts from Shakespeare, references to his work, parodies, spoofs, and just their own brilliant writing, congruent with Shakespeare's.  The directing (John Madden) is masterful, but natural and fluid.  The cinematography by Richard Greatrex (so apt) is flawless, whether tight, long, or wide shots, angles, motion. The transitions between scenes are seamless; notable are those depicting Will and Viola's lovemaking, Viola alternating Identities as Viola and Kent.  David Gamble, who provided the film editing, must have a hand in that.  How great to have this extraordinary, prodigiously awarded film, as a Prime offering!  Wholeheartedly recommend!",1490140800,5,2459,5.258974358974359

1032880,2,6305470448,"Young Will Shakespeare, suffering a bout of writer's block, happens across an intense love and draws inspiration for new material from the whirlwind romance. For a best picture winner, this is awfully mediocre stuff. The plot is simplistic and over-familiar, the acting merely acceptable, and the constant nods and winks to the budding auteur's work quickly grows excessive and wearying. Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes are attractive people and make convincing googly eyes at one another, but their relationship is so swift and passion-fueled that it never feels like more than a fiery seasonal fling. Judi Dench took home a best supporting actress statue for her work as Queen Elizabeth I, though she barely makes a cameo appearance and most of her work seems done by the wardrobe department. Irritatingly blunt at times, particularly when it tries its hand at comedy, I appreciate the freshness of the concept if not its flimsy, dated execution.",1489449600,,951,5.181818181818182
1032881,3,6305470448,"Mediocre at best. How did this get best picture over ""Saving private Ryan"" anyway? If you like faux Elizabethan era movies with todays morals imposed over them, then enjoy (similar to Moulin Rouge). But it is not historically accurate.",1489276800,,235,5.051282051282051
1032882,5,6305470448,"A beautiful and heart wrenching story. I was amazed to find out that this movie is from 1998, I assumed it was far more recent (2008-2016). Well written, comical, practical, and truthfylly beautiful within the realm of lives cruelty and pleasures.

1033051,3,6305470448,"Wardrobe and set design are excellent and really transports you back to 16th century England. The characters are nicely developed, albeit one-dimensional at times.

The sub-plot with Wessex and Shakepeare's love interest is a nice little vehicle for the drama to unfold. Like so many other historical romance movies - the beginning and the end of the movie are its best feature, the ""middle"" is bulked up with oftentimes insufferable fluff. Paltrow underwhelms in her portrayal of Viola, Fiennes completely goes of the deep end (as he often does in his other movies) and makes Shakespeare a neurotic, high on life vagabond. In my opinion Firth & Dench steal the show.

Alas, Shakespeare himself, instead of his works for once, got commercialized and received a Hollywood treatment - he probably would love it since he wrote for a quick buck and adoration by the masses himself.",1484697600,,877,5.0

William is struggling to complete his next comedy, ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"" to fulfill a promise to theater owner Philip Henslowe (portrayed with the perfect combination of panic and resignation by Geoffrey Rush). One night, William sneaks in to a party with friends and meets the daughter of the house, Viola de Lesseps and falls in love with her from across the room.  Further complicating matters, Lady Viola, tired of the constrictions of being a woman, binds her breasts and appears at auditions for ""Romeo and Ethel,"" presenting herself as the son of a servant in the household and taking messages from Shakespeare to her ""mistress.""

The all-star cast includes Dame Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, quintessential nice guy Colin Firth as Viola's betrothed, the unlikeable Lord Wessex, Ben Affleck as actor Ned Alleyn, and ""Harry Potter""'s Imelda Staunton as the Nurse. Look quick and you can even catch sight of John Inman from ""Are You Being Served.""",1467504000,3,1058,5.104046242774566

My problem comes from the promise that I would get the digital version with the BluRay. I specifically bought this version over the others because my computer does not have a built-in DVD player, and it's a pain to have to plug in my external player every time I get the urge to watch one of my favorite movies. The digital copy seemed like a good solution, especially given that I could also get a BluRay for what came out to be $8.18 with shipping. What I didn't expect was for the ultraviolet code to be expired. This is the _third_ movie I've gotten in the last year that has an expired ultraviolet code! For context, that's 3 for 3 ultraviolet codes. Looking at the back of the case, I can see that there's a tiny line about how the code may be expired past the date. Given how easy it was for me to check to see if the code was still good, the shipper should be able to check that too and send a copy that has not expired. Amazon can then sell the expired copies as regular BluRays. Had I known I wasn't going to be able to get the ultraviolet copy, I would not be disappointed, and in fact, would have been very proud of myself for having gotten a BluRay at that price.",1458086400,,1330,4.138996138996139

Dame Judi Dench plays Her Majesty to a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her eight minute performance. Gwyneth Paltrow would win her Acafemy Award for Leading Actress as Viola. Joseph Fiennes was marvelous as the Bard.

The cast includes Geoffrey Rush AC, Imelda Staunton OBE, Tom Wilkinson OBE, Simon Callow CBE, Colin Firth CBE as Lord Wessex, Martin Clunes OBE, Sir Antony Sher, and even American Ben Affleck as Ned Allen.

The director John Madden has recaptured the Elizabethean era and theatre. The film was well deserved of accolades. He led an all star cast in a romantic comedy.

The DVD includes features about the making of the film ""Shakespeare on Love and On Film;"" deleted scenes; costume; Shakespeare facts about the Bard and a Queen Elizabeth I.

1034505,5,6305470448,"A wonderful film, full of wit, romance and adventure. Young Will Shakesoeare has a writer's block and is trying to find a muse to help him restore his gift. He is unhappily in love , until he meets Viola De Lesseps, a beautiful heiress, his true love, who is dreaming of being an actress.
Women are not allowed on stage in Elizabethan England , so Viola disguises herself as Thomas Kent, a young actor and auditions for the part of Romeo.
A passionate affair sparks between Viola and Will , during which time the play ""Romeo and Juliet"" is being written.
Judy Dench is phenomenal as Elizabeth I and so is Jeffrey Rush( Pirates of The Carribbean )
as Philip Henslow, the manager and theater agent of Will Shakespeare. Did I mention  the charming( not so charming here)and talented Colin Firth( The King's Speech, Bridget Jones Diaries and ah, mr. Darcy in Pride And Prejudice)?
Love, fights, laughter and tears ,all joined in this phenomenal script combined with phenomenal actors and true to historical fact plot.

Good plot, but not historically accurate (never said it was, but historical fiction owes respect to the real figures it uses--Shakespeare's adultry is downplayed, but mentioned.  In addition, the story of Romeo and Juliet had been around years before Shakespeare was born; this movie makes you think it was somehow autobiographical.

1034603,3,6305470448,"Because of the number of academy awards this film won [including best picture] I expected a remarkable film; which this  is not. I guess the Academy just loves movies about the entertainment business; in this case, Shakespeare and putting on plays. [Another example is ""Birdman"", which was truly much ado about nothing at all.]

The script is clever but not brilliant.  It was easy for me to imagine English grad students coming up with the sight gags, as well as  the catch phrase ""it is a mystery"" to explain how a play comes together.  The references to other Shakespearean plays, as well as a few by Marlowe, were, well, about what  you would expect. Like I said: clever, but not brilliant.

Although Gwyneth Paltrow and Judi Dench are well worth watching, Joseph Fiennes [he plays Shakespeare] is boring; and Ben Affleck is jarringly out of his depth. As for the rest; workmanlike.

So, three stars.  And, considering  this film'e Oscar competition was ""Saving Private Ryan"" , shame on the Academy.",1432166400,,1003,4.847058823529411

Or, real acting for that matter! What makes this film fun and worth watching are the supposed contexts for the origins of well-known lines from Shakespeare plays, e.g., ""a plague on both your houses,"" the funny desperation of Joseph Fiennes as an ink-stained, love-struck younger Will, and the excellent supporting cast of British (Aussie) stalwarts including: Martin Clunes, Geoffrey Rush, Jim Carter, Imelda Staunton, Judi Dench (as a very short, aging Queen Elizabeth I), Tom Wilkinson as a brutish moneylender turned thespian, Simon Callow as the officious Master of the Revels, Anthony Sher as an astrologer cum psychologist, Ben Affleck, with a passable English accent as actor, Edward Alleyn, and a brief but winning cameo by Rupert Everett as Shakespeare's helpful rival, Kit Marlowe. Particularly fun are the little ""inside jokes"" salted throughout the screenplay, as when the young boy refused a role in the cast of ""Romeo and Juliet"" discloses that there is a female among the actors-- and the boy-- who likes blood and gore-- turns out to be John Webster, soon to be author of  the blood-filled ""The Duchess of Malfi.""",1432080000,2,1331,5.186046511627907

sequestered himself away and somehow created those stories and wonderful words out of a vacuum.  But ""Shakespeare in Love"" brings the man
to life as a handsome rogue and ladies' man who lives very much in the world and finds inspiration wherever he can (including from fellow authors).

1035332,2,6305470448,"This movie was so big when it came out, I remember it was all the rage. I went to see it and found it to be lousy. Filled with younger rising and not so rising stars (cue the annoying Joseph Fiennes), it was shallow and had no sense of Shakepeare's time. The only good performances were by the olders, Rush and the woman who played Queen E. whose name escapes me. I also thought Gwyneth Paltrow was dreadful, as usual. As stated, none of the younger actors seemed to care one whit about being historical, and were not successful at  making Shakespeare and his life modern, although there were moments. I especially detested the jowly Joseph Fiennes, so wrong for Shakespeare. He's gone on to some richly deserved obscurity. His voice and enunciation almost drove me from the theatre-what awful acting and being English he should be able to do more with his voice. I'm being harsh because I resent the attention this film got in 1998, it was like the 2nd coming of Christ. And it lead to the undeserved popularity of G. Paltrow, especially over her great actress Mother, Blythe Danner. You would have thought G. hated her Mother the way she was always quoted about her closeness to her Father, it really dimmed my view of Blythe for awhile, but thankfully she's as active as ever, even if in Prolia commercials, and she's been shown to have been a goid Mother and Grandmother, in spite of divorcing the irreproachable Paltrow.",1407628800,,1425,4.632411067193676

  Many of the laughs come from the references to Shakespeare's plays and background and the implication that this fictional story is responsible for his rise to prominance as an Elizabethan playwrght.

Colin Firth as her unwanted suitor and Dame Judy Dench as Queen Elizabeth I are magnificent as is the rest of the cast.

This was an excellent movie and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about Shakespeare or see him in our time today then I would watch it.

As an example, when Viola learns that the primary playwright of the era has been killed in a tavern brawl, she is devastated. When Shakespeare shows up at the funeral of Christopher Marlowe, she thinks she has seen a ghost! Shakespeare has been praying for forgiveness, thinking that he was the cause of Marlowe's death, since her gave his own name as Marlowe when in danger. You have to see it to understand and experience the wit, joy, and sorrow all contained in this breathtaking comedy/drama.

1035571,4,6305470448,"As an actor for over 40 years, it was a delight to watch a movie that tried to capture the look and feel of the Elizabethan theatre and for a few moments, could go back in time to discover roots of my love for it. And even though this is a work of fiction, it was intriguing to see how the writers put together a story of what essentially is how one of the world's greatest and well known plays, ""Romeo & Juliet"" came to be. It was also a pleasure to watch such well know actors as Paltrow, Collins, and Rush all on the same palette.

1035648,5,6305470448,"A neat movie, a great story, lots of laughs, a total transport to a time far removed, and terrific acting by a handful of first rate people.  This is a movie I put on when I need to get away for awhile.  It immediately draws me into Shakespeare's world and keeps me there, laughing and empathizing, for the duration.  Working the lines of Romeo and Juliet into the dialog is tremendous.  The final performance of the play, as we know that the protagonist is about to be carried off to America much against her will, is absolutely wonderful.  The brief appearance of Judy Dench as Queen Elizabeth puts the final touch on the whole thing.  Apart from the wonderful work of the actors (and what a host it is!) there is historical accuracy that is remarkable.  This could have been a paste up of any ""old timey"" scenery.  It was, in fact, extremely accurately done from start to finish.  So... Sometimes hilarious, sometimes touching, sometimes sad, but always engaging...Just what movies are for!!",1392595200,6,994,4.699421965317919

1035650,5,6305470448,This is a must see if you enjoy the poetic Shakespearian expression of love and a whole array of emotions revolving around the theatre during a time when only men performers were allowed to act. Gwyneth and Joseph are sensational in their roles.  There is never a dull moment and the cinamatography is awesome.,1391990400,2,310,4.7407407407407405

1035654,4,6305470448,"Like all English teachers everywhere, I love Shakespeare.  What Stoppard does with this screenwriting, is close to what he does with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.  He makes Shakespeare come to life with all of his foibles and faults, addresses quite wryly the Marlowe controversy, and formulates the possibilities of what if?  It is brilliantly acted and certainly stands the test of time.  It is in my top ten movies of all time.",1391558400,,439,4.972602739726027
1035655,3,6305470448,"I like the approach the writers (which include Tom Stoppard) took with this film, showing the kind of collaboration and spontaneity involved in writing and erecting Shakespearian plays, as well as the possible kinds of passions that may have fueled them.

There were so many funny lines that made me laugh out loud.  The cast was fantastic; top notch. Joseph Feinnes and Ms. Paltrow had great chemistry.  I did not like how quickly these two jumped into bed and did not quite follow the instant depths of their love.  It felt awkward and I was a little embarrased by the love scene.  But at the end of this movie, I felt a satisfaction and was glad I'd watched it.",1391472000,,664,4.546218487394958
1035656,5,6305470448,Who could argue about watching Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare. Gweneth Paltrow does a wonderful job of acting as well and is brilliant with an English accent.

The backstory is that men, by tradition, had always and by law, played the female roles, which provide some humorous visuals in this movie; but a young woman, posing as a man, broke this barrier, playing the role of Juliet. Queen Elizabeth, herself a theater patron, attended that premier, and along with everyone else, was greatly moved by the production, and when she learned that Juliet was indeed played by a woman, that gender barrier was broken forever, when Elizabeth herself states that she knows something of a woman playing a mans role.

1036001,5,6305470448,"The surprise crowd-pleaser of 1998 upset Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan in the Oscar race, largely because of an unprecedented publicity campaign orchestrated by Miramax Pictures, the producer and distributor. Ryan is the better movie, but there's no denying this one's appeal. It's the fanciful (meaning entirely fictional) story of Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes - Ralph's younger brother) as the famous playwright struggling both financially and artistically early in his career. He's writing a play called ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,"" which even he knows is going nowhere. Then he meets the love of his life, Lady Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his inspiration suddenly changes. The plot is far too clever to give away, except to say that its telling of the tale of the writing of Romeo and Juliet, one of the greatest plays in the English language, is so good it doesn't really matter whether it's fictional or not - you'll want to believe it is true. With terrific performances by Fiennes, whose face is wonderfully expressive, Paltrow as ""Juliet"" in various guises - the best work of her career - and strong support from Colin Firth (playing well against type) as Shakespeare's romantic rival, Geoffrey Rush as a theatre owner, and the incomparable Judi Dench in an Oscar-winning turn as Queen Elizabeth I. Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard wrote the excellent screenplay, and the lush, memorable score is by British composer Stephen Warbeck.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1378425600,,1722,5.892
1036002,5,6305470448,"As an old college English major, I loved this movie! If you think that you are just going to watch a Shakespearean play, think again. The whole movie is set when Shakespeare about 30 years old and is in London as a young, struggling playwright. He spots a beautiful young girl who has come with Queen Elizabeth I's party of 20 courtiers to see a play produced by a rival playwright. Well, of course, the two of them end-up meeting and falling in love, but as luck would have it, the Queen herself offers a ""reward in gold coin"" to see a play that really portrays the good AND the bad sides of true love. As time runs out for our ""two star-crossed lovers"", Shakespeare and his lady-love find themselves caught-up in a story as equally romantic and dangerous as Shakespeare's new play he is writing, called ""Romeo & Juliet"", a play that Shakespeare has promised to write for the Queen's contest. Can this tale of ""love and woe"" end happily or not? It is fast paced, true to its time, and you can see for yourself what happens ""when two stars collide in love and war""...",1378339200,,1067,4.4213197969543145

1036049,3,6305470448,This movie is quite fine but nothing extraordinary - despite it's awards - & in my view it must have been a pretty lean year for this to have collected as many as it did.  How Gwyneth (whom I adore) won the Oscar over Cate Blanchett I'll never know (well perhaps I do - it's America & almost  everything is - for the most part - fixed).

Tom Stoppard co-wrote the screenplay. I heard Colin Firth interviewed and he said this was his favorite movie he was in.  That was before THE KING'S SPEECH so maybe he feels differently now.

If you like Shakespeare, like a little romance, and the actors in this movie, you should enjoy the sweet alchemy in this film.  Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson, Joseph Fiennes, Simon Callow and Judy Dench also contributed their considerable talent to this film.",1375833600,,756,4.859375

But, it's not just Gwyneth that gets me to watch this film every year.  This movie is very funny and clever.  The acting is top notch--even by the supporting actors.  The writing and directing are superb.  Heck, some of it was written by the master himself!

At the end of the movie, I always get the urge to read ""A Twelfth Night"" because I want to find out what happens to Viola.  So much to read.  So little time...

1036231,5,6305470448,"One of the reasons to love Shakespeare is a love for wordplay. Tom Stoppard is one of the best practitioners of wordplay in contemporary theater. Bringing both together in a comedic movie was a great idea.
The conceits that underlies Shakespeare in Love, is that Victorian England is much like today though perhaps with more mud, and that Shakespeare as a not yet recognized genius is poor, insecure, and dependent on the love of a woman for inspiration. Okay the writer specifies horny as another of young Shakespeare's defining characteristics.

The plot builds around Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) seeking the romantic inspiration that will allow him to convert Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter into what will become Romeo and Juliet. Inspiration comes in the form of the poetry and theater loving innocent Gwenyth Paltrow (Viola). Her desires, in no particular order, are to love Shakespeare's poetry, act in one of his plays and avoid the titled husband (Lord Wessex played by Colin Firth) who has been bought for her by her father.

This movie is built upon some of the best lines from Shakespeare, a variety of comic asides, word games and cross references. Lifting it above merely brilliant use of language is the fact that the supporting cast is superior. Cast members from the young Joe Roberts (the rat catching boy will become the playwright John Webster) to Dame Judy Dench, who will win an Academy award for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth take turns commanding their respective scenes rather than merely supporting.
Shakespeare in Love is one of my all-time favorites. In fairness to those with young children and their own sensitivities there is perhaps a little more of Ms. Paltrow exposed than some viewers might approve. Other than this barest of cautions, this is an entertaining movie built on language, stage action, romance, comedy, and a bit with the dog.",1364774400,2,1884,5.015974440894569

Viola De Lesseps (Paltrow) longs to be an actor, but in this era only men appear on stage, even in women's roles. Disguised as a man, Viola wins the role of Romeo. Will soon learns her secret and the two have an affair, even as he writes the play, now called Romeo and Juliet, and while rehearsals progress. But when the Rose Theater is ordered closed it seems the show will not go on after all.

1036370,5,6305470448,"I am a film buff in general.  There are hundreds of movies that I have really enjoyed and seen multiple times over the years.  I could probably easily list several hundred that I would claim as favorites.  Two of my top favorites are Romeo And Juliet"" and ""West Side Story""  When I was a young kid I fell in love with Natalie Wood in ""West Side Story"".  When I was a high school senior, the Franco Zefferelli version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" was released and over the next several months I took everyone, girls I was dating, family, friends - anyone I could talk into going, I took them to see that film because I wanted to give everyone I knew the gift of falling in love with that film as I had.  Back then, once a movie's run was over, it didn't come back out for years and there were no VHS tapes or DVDs so I actually bought a four album set of the complete audio soundtrack of the film and listened to it over and over.  It was quite a source of amusement for my family.

So ""Shakespeare In Love"" was a perfect film for a more mature, grown up me thirty years plus after ""Romeo And Juliet""  It is so brilliantly written and the acting is superb.  I think Mr Shakespeare would have been thrilled with this story of love and comedy.  The artistic team does an incredible job of creating a world that seems so genuine and authentic.  For me, I felt transported back to that time and place.  It was probably as close as I'll ever get to having a sense of what those times and some of the people were actually like.  And it's a riveting story with a first class cast.  It's one of those few films where, toward the end, I started sneaking looks at my watch because I didn't want it to end.  Definitely one of my top 5 or 10 all time favorites!",1349395200,4,1741,4.167664670658683

But the actors pulled off this movie with such confidence and ability in their own characters that made the fans of the movie believe in their acting ability.  In my viewpoint Shakespeare, Poe, King, and Patterson are my favorite authors to read because the words they write move you as you read the stories they wrote.  But for the movie itself it was very moving and touching, and if you need a good comedical movie and powerful acting by talented actors and actress then pick this movie up and watch it when you get some free time away from work then call your friends over or watch it with someone you care for.  The movie itself has comedy, drama, and romance elements.

1036373,4,6305470448,"It's been some time since I've watched this movie.  I saw it when it originally came out, pretty much went on with life, and recently watched it again 12 years later. Twelve years ago, I don't think it impressed me as much as it did recently.  That's probably because my life has changed, my views on love, and especially my experience in writing fiction. In spite of the recent controversy stirred by the movie Anonymous, one cannot help but honor the true writer of the wonderful works of Shakespeare.

The brilliance behind this movie is that it's about the author who writes the tragedy, while he lives out his own tragedy with the woman he loves. Their love affair ensues and so does the inspiration for William's penning of Romeo and Juliet.  As the story evolves, so does the tragic truth that they will never be together.  He is bound by a previous marriage and lives a life of a lowly playwright and poet, while the woman he loves is bound by the Queen's command and her father to wed another. The stage is set for a love affair that ends in loss and separation. He writes the sad ending to Romeo and Juliet that a man cannot live without the woman he loves, mirroring the pain of his own soul.

When William's play of Romeo and Juliet finally meets the stage, by strange circumstances their lives play out before the audience. Will as Romeo and Viola as Juliet. Their hearts are torn playing their parts, as they both know their lives will be torn asunder as soon as the play ends. Each are forced to follow another path -- two star-crossed lovers never able to have one another just like the tragedy of who they portray on stage.

As far as the rest, I wasn't enthralled with seeing Colin Firth act like a sod. Judy Dench was fine, as usual.  Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush were their usual on film. It seems as if their personalities are always the same no matter what the role. Joseph Fiennes as William Shakespeare was far more believable, I thought. The perfect picture of the tortured writer, searching for his muse, passionate about life and storytelling, and always living life from one extreme of comedy to tragedy. That's the beauty of it all.",1342137600,,2166,4.535897435897436

1036375,5,6305470448,"First, this is a comedy, not a documentary, or serious work. It is a romantic comedy, and by those standards it succeeds wonderfully. It is smart, semi-historical (Marlowe, and John Webster, who did grow up to write some pretty macabre plays) although the first scene where Will is getting psychoanalyzed should tell you not to include anything from this movie on a term paper.

But the acting is fine, the plot is delightful, and the directing is suburb. Geoffrey Rush gives a wonderful performance, and Ben Affleck does a pretty mean Ned Allyne. It is interesting to see Imelda Staunton of Harry Potter fame (Dolores Umbridge) and Jim Carter of Downton Abbey (Mr Carson) in very different roles.

This is a great date night movie, smart yet entertaining. It does not try to be more than it is, and what it is is pretty good.",1338422400,,826,4.689655172413793

1036418,5,6305470448,"Joseph Fiennes plays Shakespeare, Gweneth Paltrow plays Viola DeLesseps, the lady with which he is in love. This movie attempts to express where Will got his ideas for some of his most famous lines. The balcony scene in Romeo & Juliet, for example, is seen first as Shakespeare beneath Viola's balcony. She has been offered in marriage to the Earl of Wessex, who has vast estates in Virginia but is cash poor. Her father is a wealthy merchant and, like so many of their time (1593), essentially purchases an aristocrat's estate with his daughter and a large dowry.

But there's a problem on Will's side, too: Anne Hathaway and her two children. So these are star-crossed lovers indeed.

Viola is enamored of the stage, which is not really proper for a young lady in those days. Indeed, she dreams of being an actor, which is illegal. Boys play all the female parts. But Viola is determined, and dresses in male attire to try out for the role of Romeo. At first, nobody knows she is a woman, but Will finds out after he is already in love with her as a woman.

Viola is actually very good as Romeo, playing with great passion the role Will taught her in bed, in effect. The boy playing Juliet is pretty good, too, and it makes for some strange scenes, as when they do the dance and ""hand to hand"" conversation at the beginning. But she also does things like go to the wrong side when the dancing master says ""ladies to the right, gentlemen to the left.""

Meanwhile, in her female persona, Viola is presented to Queen Elizabeth for permission for Wessex to marry her. It is clear that the Queen suspects something is mixed up about all this, but she reluctantly gives her consent to the match. She quietly tells Wessex he is an old fool for wanting to marry Viola, who will only give him grief. She does not say why.

The rather slapstick manner in which the play is rehearsed, the problems with the money-lender who wants his money taken out of the theater owner's hide, and Wessex's suspicion that someone else is playing with his love, all complicate the issues, mostly in amusing ways. For example, Will had originally called the play he expected to write ""Romeo & Edith, the Pirate's Daughter,"" so the actors who expected to play pirates keep bugging him about it. The theater owner had asked for him to write a comedy, because that was what the public wanted. So he keeps asking where the funny parts are. There are ongoing gags about the limited capabilities of the cast, and the lines they use that we recognize from Shakespeare's real plays.

I recommend it for people knowledge about Shakespeare's plays for one level, and for those who are not familiar with them for a completely different set of reasons. In sum, I think everyone will enjoy this movie.",1336780800,,2762,4.580971659919029

1036420,4,6305470448,"Shakespeare In Love pulled off a major upset at the 1998 Academy Awards when it beat out Saving Private Ryan for Best Picture.  This is probably due to the Miramax machine pumping major dollars behind the film's Oscar campaign, but in watching the film again almost fifteen years later, I think it is has held up better than Ryan.  While there's no denying the brilliance of Stephen Spielberg's directing (the opening D-Day invasion is a visual masterpiece), I found the rest of the movie to somewhat boring.  Shakespeare In Love on the other hand is charming and funny.  Gwyneth Paltrow won a deserved Best Actress Oscar portraying Viola, the daughter of wealthy merchant who loves the theater and desperately wants to act, but cannot as woman are not allowed on the stage.  She poses as a man and wins a part in William Shakespeare's (Joseph Fiennes) new play, Romeo & Juliet.  Mr. Fiennes is great as Will and the supporting cast including a sniveling Geoffrey Rush, a foppish Colin Firth, Tom Wilkerson and an Academy Award winning turn by Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth is first rate.  Even Ben Affleck is great in his brief role as an actor in the troupe.  All in all Shakespeare In Love is worth a first or repeated viewing.",1335398400,2,1230,4.688372093023256

1036424,5,6305470448,"Young Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) delivers the above final heartfelt words in the bittersweet ending to the most memorable romantic film in the decade of the 1990's.  Along the way the viewer is taken on a captivating journey back in time to the golden age of Elizabeth I in the near end of the sixteenth century where literary giants William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett) dominate and vie for theatrical prominence.  ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a bountiful smorgasbord with enough sweet and savory tidbits to please everyone: a sizzling yet warmhearted love affair between two charismatic, gorgeous young players, comedy that ranges from the bawdy and slapstick to burnished wit and satire, lustrous pearls of poetry in excerpts from ""Romeo and Juliet"", swashbuckling sword fights, cross-dressing, mistaken identity plus sixteenth century gangsters and enough ""in-jokes"" to satisfy the most erudite Shakespearian scholar.

Here's a brief synopsis, it's 1593 in London, England, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) reigns triumphantly, but actor/playwright Will Shakespeare has a severe case of writer's block.  He urgently needs a feminine ""muse"" for inspiration and with a little bit of luck to also satisfy an ever-present sexual itch, since it's been awhile for that as well, and he's a pretty lusty fellow!  Enter Lady Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), a beautiful stage-struck young heiress, who auditions for Will's new play ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"" disguised as a male, ""Thomas Kent"", since it was verboten for women to appear on the stage.  This is being presented at the Rose Theatre owned by the pragmatic Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush), and is initially going to be a comedy, but has yet to be written.  Struck by ""Thomas Kent's"" audition at the Rose reciting Will's work, Will pursues him to the De Lesseps estate, which is the midst of preparing for a ball that evening.  Bluffing his way in to the celebration, he catches a glimpse of the beauteous Viola and Cupid shoots a shaft into his heart.  Dazzled and lovesick, he manages to speak and dance with her, and she is smitten with him as well.  After the ball, they have a brief tte--tte at the balcony of Viola's bedchamber.  However, Will doesn't realize Thomas Kent and Lady Viola are one and the same, and Kent is awarded the role of Romeo the following day.  That night Will discovers Viola's ruse, and both happily plunge into a passionate love affair aided and abetted by Viola's loyal nurse (Imelda Staunton).  Viola is indeed the inspiration Will requires, he rises each morning from Viola's bed newly refreshed and reinvigorated like the fabled phoenix with the flame of his talent soaring brightly.  His frivolous comedy undergoes a sea change, evolving into a purer and finer work, the tragedy of ""Romeo and Juliet"", with ""Thomas Kent"" continuing to play Romeo.  Yet the path to true love doesn't run smoothly, Lady Viola is newly betrothed to an impoverished blueblood, the arrogant and jealous Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) for his pedigree by her wealthy, social climbing father, and will be married after two weeks, and Will though separated has a wife and three children back in Stratford on Avon.  Besides all that, the play's genesis is bumpy, what with Henslowe still expecting a comedy, a loan shark to whom Henslowe owes money, Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson) and his henchman lurking in the background, a star player Ned Alleyn (Ben Affleck) whose large ego needs constant coddling, and the Queens Master of the Revels Edmund Tilney (Simon Callow) prowling around looking for any excuse to shot down the Rose Theatre.  How will this all resolve itself?

My wife and I first discovered Gwyneth Paltrow in a revival of William Inge's ""Picnic"" at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in the summer of 1991.  She was just nineteen and up to that point I had only known her as the daughter of one of my favorite actresses, Blythe Danner.  Well, in a supporting role she stole the show, upstaging not only her mother, but also such well-known actors as Tony Goldwyn and Jane Krakowski.  It was thrilling to see such raw talent burst upon the stage, and from then on my wife and I were fans, and expecting wondrous portrayals from her.  With her Viola in ""Shakespeare in Love"", she fulfilled that early promise. She skillfully brings off her dual role as Viola/Thomas creating two markedly different individuals, and two separate English accents.  While as Thomas, she looks a shade shifty and anxious, it works in the context of the story, since Viola needs to be sure her disguise won't be penetrated.  As Lady Viola she is the perfect English rose, with a blooming peaches and cream complexion and luxuriant, rippling waves of sun kissed tresses.  Her Viola is indeed Shakespeare's heroine for all time, a woman for all seasons. You can well believe that besides sparking the creation of Viola in ""Twelfth Night"", she is also responsible for other memorable, entrancing Shakespearian heroines such as Rosalind, Portia and Beatrice.  Her Viola is a young woman with a twentieth century sensibility bold, adventurous, free thinking yet canny and wise all the while retaining her femininity.  When fate unexpectedly lends a hand and she gets to actually play Juliet to Will's Romeo at the premier performance, she is at first luminous vision of innocence in gleaming gold and ivory satin who rapidly ripens into a passionate woman because of her love.

Regarding Joseph Fiennes performance as Will Shakespeare, my wife and I felt the same sensation we had of Ms. Paltrow's in ""Picnic"", the discovery of an exciting young actor of power and authority.  His young Shakespeare has a brooding authority, a sense of mystery, a touch of star quality, and the promise of future greatness, yet there is a refreshing sense of navet, and a dry sense of humor.  His Will is a man of many parts, just as the real person must have been.  Fiennes' lean, dark, dashing handsomeness balances well the angelic blonde beauty of Paltrow.  Their love scenes together flare with a white-hot incandescence, they are truly erotic, yet there is a tenderness and true love there as well.  Mr. Fiennes was the only main member of the cast who was overlooked by the Academy Awards for a nomination, sheer stupidity!",1333065600,,6299,4.991395793499044
1036425,5,6305470448,"This is by far one of the best romantic comedies of all time, and in my personal top ten movies.  It's a comedy for smart people, a romance for anyone who has been in love.  Watching this movie always makes me want to reread Romeo and Juliet and the Tempest.  Seeing Gwenyth and Joseph Fiennes perform the ""first"" production of Romeo and Juliet in the movie still gives me chills.  The recreation of the Globe theater is fabulous, and seeing the rabble watch the performance on the floor of the Globe is truly amazing.  I know the movie isn't exactly historically accurate, but I imagine that some of those feelings were really true to life.

My wife loves this movie even if the the story line is less than factual- far fetched even - but it's one of those 'feel good' films that grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. Terrific performances and a rich story line create an atmosphere of lightheartedness that keeps even the most crusty soul entertained.

  The way I look at it, 'Patton' or the 'Matrix' or anything by the 'Duke' ( that's John Wayne to us 'pilgrims' in-the-know ) might appeal more to my sensibilities but if the wife states she wants to watch a romantic movie for a change, well, this one is made to order.

  The movie is very well made with rich production values, the BluRay sound and visuals are top notch and Gwyneth Paltrow is especially easy on the eyes in her period costumes. Overall 'Shakespeare In Love' is a winner. Keeping the peace and making the 'better half' a happy ( and romantic ) viewer has never been so easy.

1036471,5,6305470448,"At first I resented that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN lost Best Picture to this film but after viewing this a couple of times I began to appreciate why SIL won this close contest. The idea that Shakespeare is a struggling writer who can't write much of anything until he falls in love with a woman he cannot have is a refreshing idea. It's hilarious at times to watch Shakespeare (played by Joseph Fiennes) early on as he struggles to create what we know to become classic works yet they have absolutely horrible titles and barely a first act in the play. What's great about this film is you get to see actors and actresses before they were very well known. Tom Wilkinson (before he was well known) is hilarious as a money lender turned to minor actor who practices his lines over and over again as an apothecary and still does a poor delivery on stage. That makes it even better as most of us know what a high quality actor he is/has become. The humorous moments in this piece are surprisingly good and still get a laugh out of me after this fourth viewing. How many straight up comedies can do that? Very few. Other amusing tidbits: some of his biggest and best lines are overheard as he's walking about in the crowds, wanna be playwrights try to get him to read their works just like in Hollywood, actors at the end of the play dreading the silence from the audience and then basking in relief as the audience erupts into applause, and people keep talking about what a timeless writer that Marlowe fellow is which just riles Shakespeare. There are several nods to Shakespeare's works, the Jacobean playwright Daniel Webster and even the Roman tragedian, Seneca. The Academy Awards nominated it for a ton of awards and it won several, including not only Best Picture but also Best Actress (Gwyneth Paltrow), Best Supporting Actress (Judi Dench) and Best Original Screenplay (Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman). Other notables in this film were Ben Affleck, Colin Firth (THE KING'S SPEECH), Geoffrey Rush and Rupert Everett. You don't have to be a lover of Shakespeare's works to enjoy this picture by the way. I certainly have found most of his works ponderous readings and tend to enjoy the summaries more than reading the plays with their many student footnotes on every page.

1036476,5,6305470448,"This is a very fun movie, one of my favorites.  There are several things going on at the same time, interwoven in a fast-paced and continually hilarious narrative.  The young Shakespeare is experiencing his first creative draught.  He seethes with life, energy, and ambition, a beautiful young man who will become the greatest writer in ENglish of all time.  He must find his muse.  Fiennes is absolutely brilliant in this starring debut.

Then there is the social portrait of an historical era, splendidly brought to life.  He is of a low social status, below that even of artisans, yet their work is anticipated by Queen Elizabeth herself.  Though women are forbidden from acting, an extraordinarily beautiful young lady wants to act.  This is doubly forbidden, as she is of the merchant class and her father is arranging a marriage to an aristocrat, for title.

Of course, they fall in love, in a comedy of errors with the amazing characters that hang about the theatre.  It brings the whole thing together, with Shakespeare finding his inspiration, to write Romeo and Juliet as his doomed affair continues, adding bits from real life and odd considerations like including a producer in the play.  It is a creative journey unlike anything I have ever seen, doesn't pretend to be accurate, but works.

As an American, there were many things I responded to for a full film experience. But my wife, a Brit, saw a completely different level to it in the word play and witticisms.  There was so much that I didn't get, which added to the delight of the film.  It is one of our favorites.

And you know what? Those people may be right, but that really doesn't stop me from enjoying this one enormously. It's a well-made movie, with a script by Tom Stoppard that dares to intelligently engage with and respect the artistic process while simultaneously poking a little good-natured fun at the overwrought seriousness sometimes associated with it. The performances are all engaging - even Affleck manages to be watchable - and the sets and costumes are just stellar.

Originally released into cinemas in early 1999, ""Shakespeare In Love"" was nominated for a whopping 13 Academy Awards and went on to win 7 - Best Picture, Best Leading and Supporting Actress, Screenplay, Set Design, Costumes and Music. So many things came together on this film - the inspired casting of Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes as Viola De Lessops and William Shakespeare, Geoffrey Rush as the permanently living-on-the-edge theatre owner Philip Henslowe (his dialogue titles this review), Colin Firth as the dastardly and arrogant Lord Wessex (wittily refers to life in 1593 as ""Dallas in frocks""), right down to the ordinary-people emotion of Imelda Staunton who is superb as Viola's nurse. In fact the entire ensemble cast (Tom Wilkinson, Martin Clunes, Rupert Everett, Jim Carter and Simon Callow) are all superlative and add hugely to its overall classy feel. There's John Madden's assured direction (he did ""Mrs. Brown""), the beautifully evocative score by Steven Warbeck, the 17 fully reconstructed buildings and two theatres created by the Production teams and of course the movie's true ace-in-the-hole - the stunning screenplay by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman which successfully emulates the bard's genius while at the same time making him real and human to us. Back in late 2007 I posted a List in Listmania on Amazon UK called ""25 Movie Dialogues You Must Hear Before You Die"" - and number 6 is the scene where Paltrow talks of love to her nursemaid as she readies for bed (""...love that will overthrow mountains...come ruin or rapture..."") - it's sensational stuff and in modern-day speak equal to the bard himself (no mean feat).

ASPECT/PICTURE QUALITY:
This Blu Ray's default setting is 2:35 aspect (puts borders on the top and bottom of the screen automatically), but I found taking it to full-screen on my Sony didn't distort or stretch the image too much - if at all. But the real deal here is the picture quality itself - which is never less than brilliant and at times truly beautiful. The most obvious and immediately noticeable thing is the costumes. There's a scene where the 'players' are finally staging ""Romeo And Juliet"" in front of a rapt audience at 'The Curtain' - it cuts to Colin Firth hanging from the rafters watching his new wife play Juliet and then cuts to Joseph Fiennes as Romeo on the stage opposite Paltrow - the colours in their clothes is just awesome. Even on the indoor scenes, the lighting is fabulous - little or no blocking - a hugely enjoyable experience.

Niggles - the extras are essentially the same as the DVD - the 20-minute 'Making Of' is particularly good and includes interviews with all the key people behind the camera and in front of it (as well as other actors already mentioned Judy Dench and Ben Affleck are also included) - but it's a shame there wasn't more dug out for this reissue. It deserved it. A minor point, but one worth making...

This BLU RAY reissue of ""Shakespeare In Love"" is a triumph - a romantic, funny and hugely uplifting film finally given a chance to shine - and with a gorgeous print.

In the words of the great man himself (from Sonnet 18):

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee...""",1296086400,10,4618,4.902688860435339

1036535,2,6305470448,"This film, about one of the greatest playwrights/poets who ever lived, and my personal favourite, William Shakespeare, could have been a family-friendly film in the style of ""Howards End,"" ""The Remains Of The Day,"" ""Ever After,"" Walt Disney Picture's masterpiece ""Beauty And The Beast"" (my all-time favourite movie) and others, but the screenwriters decided, rather stupidly and in the name of ""Sex sells,"" to insert sex and nudity in this movie (one of which occurs during an other-wise beautiful montage sequence in the middle of the movie). I'm no prude, but unless a story requires nudity (ie. ""Schindler's List""), there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to have someone naked in a movie just to draw a huge crowd into theaters (I guess the nude scene in ""Titanic"" was one reason many guys went to see that atrocious unhistorical movie), especially in a period piece. Also, there were a lot of historical errors in the film (I'm unsure exactly how many and the nature of the errors, but I'm certain that William Shakespeare WAS NOT a womanizer). Here's a little-known fact about Shakespeare, and I say little-known because it's not even on the Internet or in today's history-books: William Shakespeare was a CHRISTIAN. The famous line from ""The Tragicall Historie Of Hamlet, Prince Of Denmarke,"" Act V, Scene II, ""There's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow"" is a paraphrase of Jesus saying something about sparrows in The Gospel According To Saint Matthew. I give this film two stars because the actors were top-notch in this movie, especially Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes (though I think Ralph Fiennes would also have made a good Shakespeare, albeit he's not as handsome as Joseph) & Ben Affleck (like Robin Williams, he CAN do drama) and because of the excellent costume/set designs for the film. I've yet to view any of the special features on the DVD. This movie IS NOT for kids. Rated R for sexuality/nudity.

Perhps the people who commented did not read my review thoroughly. I said that I don't mind nudity in a movie as long as it is essential to the plot (ie. ""Schindler's List""), and I'm not averse to violence in movies as long as it is-you guessed it-neccessary to propel the story forward. Watch any movie made in the 1930's, 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, and you'll see the graphic violence, language and nudity were not neccessary to the storylines (aside from the fact that the Hays Code prohibited such content).",1283817600,4,2445,4.905797101449275

1036569,5,6305470448,"There is a lot of stigma that follows this film.  In my circle of cinephile friends, any discussion of the year that was 1998 ends in debate, sometimes aggressive.  Now, I have always felt that Oscar handled the `Director' and `Picture' races correctly (even if my top five differs drastically from theirs).  Steven Spielberg worked wonders with his director of `Saving Private Ryan'.  There is no doubt in my mind that he deserved that Oscar ten times over for what he was able to create.  That said, I find the film itself to be mediocre at best.  The plot is weakly realized, the script is all sorts of bland and the acting is hit and miss.  In fact, the only real saving grace is the sharp direction.

`Shakespeare in Love' is leagues better than `Saving Private Ryan', even if the direction isn't as inspired.

The film is a fictitious telling of Shakespeare's rise as a playwright.  He is a joke so-to-speak until he finds true inspiration in a rapturous affair with the beautiful Viola De Lesseps.  Sadly, much like the ill-fated romances that circulate the majority of Shakespeare's visions, their love could not be.  Shakespeare was married and Viola was promise in marriage to the evil (not really evil, but highly unlikable) Lord Wessex.  Still, Shakespeare and Viola continued their love affair.  Viola disguised herself as a man in order to participate in Shakespeare's play `Romeo + Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter' (which later became known as `Romeo + Juliet'), all the while keeping her groom-to-be at bay.

Shockingly, this film is truly romantic.  For all the slivers of comic glory included, the film has a very beautiful edge that makes it one of the most spellbinding and romantic of all the date-movies of the 90's.  The fact that it remains intelligent and compelling throughout is a major bonus.

The film rests on some very sturdy shoulders, and that is a blessing as well.  Both Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes are believable and engaging here.  A lot of debate can also be found in the Best Actress category, with camps claiming that Paltrow was better than Blanchett and visa-versa.  Personally, I think Emily Watson should have won (actually I think Cameron Diaz should have won, but she wasn't even nominated), but I am one who feels that Paltrow's win was inspired and deserving.  First of all, she did not chew up the scenery in the most dramatized of ways as her competitors did (at least the two I mentioned).  Instead, she allows the slow burn of her charismatic persona to evoke a real sense of emotional relevancy with her character.  She was very, very real.  Joseph Fiennes was also spectacularly real.  I loved the way that his melancholy approach served as a nice contrast to the films comic tones without ever once feeling out of place.  Judy Dench is ravenous as the sharp-tongued Queen Elizabeth, and Ben Affleck shows some comic mastery here as well.  Geoffrey Rush was hammy, but delightfully so.  I don't agree with his nomination, especially when you consider that Tom Wilkinson went without one, but alas, he was good here.

Wilkinson was best-in-show for me though.  With such a small role, he never stopped acting.  Wilkinson kind of reminds me of Robert Logia in that he acts from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet, even when attention is not focused on him.  When you watch a scene, Wilkinson could be in the backdrop and not even part of the scene really, but when you watch him you notice that he NEVER drops character.  Here he is sharp witted without ever hamming it up, even for a second.

Astonishing performance.

In the end, there may not be a lot of weight to this film, but it is beyond entertaining and it really embodies the spirit of Shakespeare well.  I also loved the fact that, instead of painting his life like a mirror image of his work (take that `Becoming Jane'), it showed how his life inspired his work.  Shakespeare had such a wide range in his work, and I loved how this script skillfully and wittily created something relatable from that work.

So yeah, I think that `Shakespeare in Love' deserved that Oscar.",1271635200,2,4100,4.72112676056338
1036570,5,6305470448,"The winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture for 1998 (awarded in 1999), ""Shakespeare in Love"" has gotten some unfair bad press in my opinion, largely due to its beating ""Saving Private Ryan"" in the contest.  The latter film, a dramatic epic that redefined cinematic depictions of combat, has been widely viewed as the superior product.  As a matter of personal opinion, I prefer ""Shakespeare in Love"", though I acknowledge that I am squarely in the middle of the film's target demographic:  English Literature nerds who will get jokes about a violence-loving theatre assistant named John Webster.  Nevertheless, the film is a stirring and witty tribute to Shakespeare and Renaissance theatre.

Set late in the reign of Elizabeth I (Judi Dench, in an eight-minute performance that won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes, brother of Ralph) is a struggling playwright working at the Rose Theatre, owned by Phillip Henslowe, who is deep in the hock.  Shakespeare is a prodigious talent, but romantic disappointment has resulted in a serious case of writer's block.  Henslowe needs the comedy ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter"" finished soon, and Shakespeare needs inspiration, which comes in the form of Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), and ardent admirer of his plays who poses as a man to audition for a part.  The two fall in love, but she is to marry the Earl of Wessex (Colin Firth; oddly, a year after the film was made, this title was created for Prince Edward; maybe Elizabeth II was a fan?).

This is a very smart and clever film, to start.  Written by acclaimed playwright Tom Stoppard with Marc Norman (who won an Oscar for it), it displays tremendous understanding of the time period, as well as the literature surrounding Shakespeare (choosing, for purposes of comic and dramatic effects to ignore the basis for ""Romeo and Juliet"" in an Italian story).  You are given a real sense of the nature of the theatre of the period, and all of the competing demands on writers (the greatest writer of the English language was working for pence on a line, as he puts it).  And Shakespeare is not yet the greatest English writer, with a running gag being the constant praise for Christopher Marlowe, who advises Shakespeare on his writing.

Gwyneth Paltrow won an Oscar for this star-making turn, and she is indeed marvellous, providing the soul of the film.  She conveys tremendous passion, both romantic and for the theatre: she's not an especially convincing man, but that is a comic device that Shakespeare knew well.  Joseph Fiennes as the other lead is good; Fiennes is not the most talented actor out there, but he provides the requisite romantic intensity, and is believable as a playwright.  Ben Affleck is hilarious in a minor role as Edward Alleyn, one of the biggest  stars on the Renaissance stage, an egotist tricked into playing a minor role.  Dench is tartly funny, and there are a number of other recognizable faces, including Tom Wilkinson.

One of only two comedies to win Best Picture in the last 30 years, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is well worth seeing.",1268265600,2,3128,4.91254752851711

1036572,5,6305470448,"Well actually, this film stands on its own.  Who knows this could be the way it happened or should have happened. Writer Tom Stoppard takes a few liberties with reality and time to bring you the ""True"" story behind Shakespeare's genius, which would never have surfaced if it were not for love, friendship, tragedy, and a Virgin Queen.

Young Shakespeare has writers block. Then he meets and falls in love with Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) the daughter of a nobleman, Viola on the other hand is interested in the forbidden fruit of acting.

This film is set with one-liners and many witty inferences as each character plays off of the other. We almost had the play ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"".  My favorite line is when Philip Henslowe: The show must... you know...  William Shakespeare: [prompting him] Go on!

Do not miss Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth.  Her few appearances add spice to the film.

The script is not just poetic, smart and beautiful, but believable and very, very moving. I can just imagine that this is exactly what happened to William Shakesphere, and how he got the ideas for Romeo and Juliet. The characters in this movie are developed so well. Even the more minor characters. There's also humor, which adds to the film greatly. The costumes were fantastic, especially the queens.

Production values are excellent, scenery and costumes lush, sound and score fine. The cast is more than up to the task of creating Elizabethan England. You'll find Gwyneth Paltrow a wonder.

It's not meant to be a documentary of the writer's life, nor does it boast that it tells a true story.  The most history buffs could expect are a few grins here and there, what with the scene Christopher Marlowe plotting out ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"" that nods to the ""Shakespeare didn't write his own plays"" theory, the inclusion of the sadistic child John Webster, and the many lines of dialogue Shakespeare hears and later incorporates into his plays.  These are all quite enjoyable, and should help any uptight history buff to remove the stick etcetera etcetera so they can enjoy this film for what it is.

On the acting side, things are nothing but great.  I, for one, hate the institution of ""big name actors"" and think that most small time television stars do better jobs than your Pitts or Damons, but I really can't complain about Gwyneth Paltrow in this film.  She does a wonderful, wonderful job, but it truly serves to compliment the performance of Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare.  He is a force of life on film, giving a passionate, hilarious, and downright sad portrayal of what many people see as the greatest writer in the English language.  In my opinion, it would have been impossible to do a better job.

It's an intelligently written and passionately acted film with attention to details in plot and character development that is truly impressive.  This is very much worth owning on DVD.

1036616,2,6305470448,"What is interesting about this portrayal of William Shakespeare is that the historical figure was actually descended from the Saxon Earls of Warwick (and from the famous West Saxon royal dynasty which included Alfred the Great, Edward the Elder and Athelstan the Glorious).  Shakespeare's mother was a de Arden, after all, and the heiress of the hereditary family estate called Kingsbury [Saxon for: 'King's Borough'], which shows the family's close connection to the Saxon seat of royal authority in Wessex.

William the Conqueror earned the sobriquet of 'Willie the Bastard' by, among other things, disenfranchising his supporters such as the (Saxon) de Warwicks and enfranchising native Norman families such as the Newburghs in their place. [Note: the replacement of the de Warwicks did not, in point of fact, occur until after the Rebellion of 1088 under William Rufus, 22 years after the Conquest].  While this had the effect of buying off temporarily William I & II's competition, it produced trauma in the families displaced from major nobility earned over 500 years in the Saxon hierarchy.  Shakespeare was just one example of a princely line now converted to minor nobility and having to ""sing for its supper"" after being displaced from hereditary landholdings.  On the other hand, it is arguable whether there ever would have been a Shakespeare if he had been personally taken up with managing the great estate of his forefathers; he would have had no time or perhaps would have developed no interest in writing.

Hence, it is surely at least ironic that the movie has him competing with the now Norman ""Lord Wessex"", pitting his Saxon pedigree against a Norman rival of appointed, but of in fact inferior rank.  I wonder if the writers of the screenplay comprehended the irony (and implausibility) in this fictional rendition?  Furthermore, it must be noted that the Oxfordian theory of authorship is abundantly disproven once Shakespeare's royal heritage is revealed.  Shakespeare had ample evidence from his own lineage about how court intrigue played out and thus, did not need secondary sources or a ghost writer for assistance.",1215388800,,2143,5.170520231213873

This is a Romantic Comedy like no other.

Gweneth Paltrow as Viola De Lesseps was well deserving for Best Actress in a Leading Role as her understanding and feeling for all the roles she played (both Romeo & Juliet) and Viola, exceeded my expectations.

Joseph Fiennes, however, though an intense performance, was maybe too over acted, but done with passion, revealing the true passion of an artist and a true genius.

In fact, all the performances are first rate.

Personally, films done in a ""theatrical format"", have alway been intriguing, (Hitchcock's ""Rope"" for example) giving the audience (perhaps unconsciously), the perception that they're actually seeing a live perfomance.

The final scene in the actual play, performed in the film, (the death scene) was done very well and quite moving.

Shakespeare, as time moves forward, is becoming harder to teach, enabling that 'penny to drop' with students, understanding Old English. This film would be a good ""primer"" for the i-pod & cell phone generation to catch a glimpse of the English language read and spoken in its original beauty.

1036698,4,6305470448,"""Shakespeare in Love"" is a wonderful film, but might have been even more wonderful with two different actors in the leading roles.  This is particularly true of the film's leading lady, the highly overrated Gwyneth Paltrow.  Without her bleached blonde hair, anorexic frame, and famous theatrical parents (who were close friends of people like Steven Spielberg, who gave Paltrow her first part), no one would ever have looked at Paltrow, who brings this film down several notches with her glaring inferiority to the rest of the cast.  She produces her English accent by overlaying her unpleasantly nasal voice with constant breathiness, and ends up sighing her lines most of the time; she indicates high emotion by wrinkling her eyebrows and bobbing her chin in and out - this barely competent actress gets by here due to the reflected glow of REAL talent, i.e., people like Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Tom Wilkinson, Judy Dench, Rupert Everett (in a marvelous turn as Marlowe, Shakespeare's rival) and others who really CAN act.  Even the limited Ben Affleck does better (although only a bit better) than Paltrow does with her Pretensions to High Falutin' British-Type Acting.  Spare me references to the Oscar that Paltrow got for this role: this is the same Academy that gave Tommy Lee Jones Best Supporting Actor for his work in ""The Fugitive"" over the performance of Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi concentration camp commandant in ""Schindler's List"" (heck, Fiennes's performance only shows up regularly on critics' lists of ""Ten Best Screen Performances by an Actor Ever"" - yeah, we'll ALL remember the far superior work Tommy Lee Jones did in that great epic, ""The Fugitive""!) So much for Paltrow's Oscar.

And speaking of Fiennes, Joseph Fiennes (Ralph's younger brother), decently talented and handsome enough, does better than his leading lady - but he lacks the spark that would make you care.  The result is that the supporting cast in this film is far superior to the two leads and far more interesting to watch.  Geoffrey Rush, in fact, totally walks off with this film, just as he nearly walked off with ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".  One can only imagine what ""Shakespeare in Love"" might have been like with a young Cate Blanchett (or even Keira Knightley) as Viola de Lessup and, say, a young Gary Oldman as the Bard.

Well, it was not to be, but in the meantime, what we have here is a highly entertaining two hours of speculation on how ""Romeo and Juliet"" (and ""Twelfth Night"") might have come to be written, based on a witty script that incorporates sly digs at the social mores of Elizabethan England, life in the theater in ANY era, and modern culture, as well, all brought to you via Tom Stoppard.

The film revolves around the star-crossed romance between a youthful Shakespeare and one Lady Viola de Lessup, and the evolution of ""Romeo and Juliet"" as Shakespeare transfers the ups and downs of his romance with de Lessup onto the page, and thence to the stage. Shakespeare, of course, was married by the time he wrote ""Romeo and Juliet"", but even had he not been, the social gulf between a ""hired player"" and a titled lady would have made this match impossible. So, the film follows the two, as Shakespeare pours their hopeless love into his latest play, ""Romeo and Juliet"".  It's not exactly the first time this structure has been done, but it works as well here as it ever has.

As the film opens, the Bard is having a bit of writer's block as he struggles to write the next play he has promised Rush, who owns one of the two rival theaters operating in London.  Rush is already in hock up to his eyebrows to a merciless moneylender (Tom Wilkinson) and desperately needs a hit play.  As Shakespeare wrestles with writer's block, Lady Viola de Lessup (Paltrow), only child of a wealthy businessman, is being cased as a suitable bride with a large dowry by the noble but poor Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), with an eye to recouping his fortunes in the tobacco fields of the New World.  But Viola is stagestruck and in love with the theater, and has no eyes for a socially brilliant match.  She longs to go on stage herself, but even if her social status did not preclude it, the law of the land at the time did not allow women to act onstage - it was thought lewd, and women's roles were played by men and boys, with ingenue parts going to young boys whose voices had not yet broken.

Needless to say, the plays of Will Shakespeare come to Lady Viola's attention, and Lady Viola comes to Shakespeare's attention at a party at her father's house, and before you know it, Lady Viola has dressed up in boys' clothing and auditioned for and won a role in Shakespeare's latest play, and soon the playwright finds out that his new play's leading man is actually the woman he fell madly in love with at first sight, and then - enter Lord Wessex, whose offer for the hand of Lady Viola has been accepted by her father, and the match approved by a (somewhat stagestruck heself) Queen Elizabeth I (Judi Dench). . .well, you get the drift.

The sub-plots and vagaries of life in the theater and the central love story are expertly woven together, the script is relentlessly witty and includes merry references to some of the earthier aspects of life in Elizabethan England, as well as plenty of backstage backbiting, quarreling, sex, and intrigue.  Jokes on the Bard's most famous lines abound - meant, of course, to impress upon modern audiences just how thoroughly Shakespeare's influence still permeates our culture and language.

The film is beautifully photographed, and, with the exception of Paltrow and Affleck, who seem to have wandered onto the wrong set, the cast is so marvellous that you can't help enjoying yourself.  Two leading actors on the level of the rest of the cast would have gotten this film another star, but even with its flawed leads, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is fast, funny, and delightful.",1202688000,4,5917,4.735408560311284

1036700,4,6305470448,"London,1593. Queen Elizabeth is on the Throne,two famous playwrights Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare rule the theatre and women are forbidden to act on stage. That's the truth. Now the rest is all the hilarious and witty conjecture of Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.Anyone familiar with Stoppard's other famous spoof on Shakespeare,ROSENKRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD,knows that Stoppard's works are filled with one liners and so many references to Shakespeare's characters and writings, that one almost needs to be a true Bard Officienado  to take all of it in! (I am not-but I know enough).Stoppard and Norman place us in the time when Shakespeare has writer's block and is need of a Muse to inspire him. The result will be his ""Romeo and Juliet"" and eventually his ""Twelth Night"".Shakespeare,a comically tuned Joseph Fiennes discovers his inspiration in Lady Viola de Lessups,Gwyneth Paltrow,whose chief love is poetry and the theatre. She disguises herself as a man in order to be on stage, and thus begins the love affair and the comedy.
Though I have seen this film several times over the years and genuinely like it, I still find it tedious at times and unnervingly frantic. I especially do not like the clumsy editing and cutaways that that are very obvious. What I do like is the acting of Joseph Fiennes who I feel is the best that this film has to offer. Other roles that seemed to have gone unnoticed were a very funny Ben Affleck and Imelda Staunton.
I did and still do not feel this should have won the top prize at the Oscars,but I do find it an enjoyable jaunt every time I take the trip.",1197158400,2,1639,4.791519434628976

Since Bill's complete known works can be downloaded via the Guttenberg project, this movie can lead to an obsession with all things English. When we realize how much that small piece of real estate has contributed (Calculus, Physics, Chemistry......) it seems like a valid obsesssion.

1036862,5,6305470448,"Shakespeare in Love is the rarest of films. It is at once intelligent and witty; comical and serious; romantic and swashbuckling. It evokes the mid to late 16th century with Oscar nods for costume design and ""art Direction-set Decoration"". But my personal favorite, when it came to historical accuracy, was the throwing of waste water from houses/taverns directly into the street. We saw this when Geoffrey Rush's fantastic comic character Philip Henslowe trudged about the streets. The emptied waste buckets landed either just in front of him, or behind him. That served as a just reminder to any who might have overly romantic notions about living in that time. Sewage systems had yet to be perfected.

Joseph Fiennes received the same snub at the Oscars that DiCaprio had just one year prior: he appeared in almost all of the scenes, yet wasn't nominated. That's more than passing strange. How is it that an actor can appear in nearly the entire film, yet not be judged as lending to its perceived greatness (it won 7 Oscars)?

The entire ensemble worked quite well together; indeed, they were awarded with the Actor for Best Ensemble from the Screen Actors Guild. Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, Gwyneth Paltrow as Shakespeare's muse, Violet (both of whom won Oscars for their roles), and Geoffrey Rush were highlights. Judi Dench turned in what must now be known as a ""Hopkins performance"". Hopkins was on the screen for 15 minutes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>, and won Best Supporting Actor. Dench was on screen for a reported 8 minutes, and she won Best Supporting Actress.

The Amazon reviewer indicated that it would take a Shakespearean scholar to ""dissect the numerous parallels"", and when I saw this first in the theatre, in 1998, I thought the same myself. Watching it again today, I wish I'd spent more time brushing up on Shakespeare. The screen writers brilliantly used real people (Christopher Marlowe, Henslowe, Burbage), and I know that several ""jokes"" were lost on me. I'm not sure that I'm going to spend the requisite time brushing up on Shakespeare (is there such a thing without immersion?), but the movie caused such desire within me.",1174694400,5,2302,5.267029972752043

It is divine to have a copy to watch whenever I want and when I do, I wake up to music that will not banish itself from my heart every morning for weeks.  Just loved this movie.",1173830400,,460,4.337209302325581
1036864,4,6305470448,"This film functions on two levels--as a rapturously beautiful love story between Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes, and as a satire on the harsh realities of Elizabethan England in the tradition of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" and ""Blackadder II."" My favorite part is the boy outside the theater playing with rats, who turns out to be John Webster, future author of Elizabethan gorefests ""The Duchess of Malfi"" and ""The White Devil""--Edgar Allen Poe's predecessor and the man who should perhaps be considered the true inventor of giallo.

It's a safe bet Elizabethan England was never quite like this. But then the antebellum south was never quite like ""Gone With the Wind"" and ancient Rome was never quite like ""Gladiator."" Half the fun is spotting the errors: i.e., Colin Firth inviting everyone to his tobacco plantation in Virginia in 1593, when Jamestown wouldn't be settled until 1607 and tobacco wouldn't be introduced to the colony until 1619 (along with slavery, but that's a different story).

All cavils aside, this film does catch a young William Shakespeare at a point in his life when he was trying to break free from Christopher Marlowe's shadow and find his own poetic voice. Joseph Fiennes is splendid as a young ""Will"" Shakespeare, a bohemian living on the edge whose art draws its inspiration from life on the street. The historical Shakespeare was in all likelihood gay or bisexual, so it's oddly fitting that he's first attracted to Lady Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) when she's disguised as a boy.

Ah, Gwyneth . . . it's hard to recapture the crush I had on her when this movie was made. Now she's lost whatever cool she once had. But this was before Coldplay, before Apple, before she said Americans were less intelligent than Brits. Now it seems like she will never repeat the magic of this one film. But it was great while it lasted.

The rest of the cast is great, except for the eternally annoying Ben Affleck as Edward Alleyn. Dame Judi Dench's Elizabeth is probably not as close to the original as Bette Davis nor as funny as Miranda Richardson in Blackadder II, but she won a well-deserved Oscar for her role. Geoffrey Rush steals the show as mercenary theater producer Philip Henslowe and Tom Wilkinson has a striking role as ruthless loan shark Mr. Fennyman, who shows an unexpected sensitive side in his reaction to Shakespeare's poetry--indeed, his appreciation of Shakespeare's genius is far more genuine than Henslowe's.

This film has suffered perhaps from a post-Oscar backlash and the outrage of critics who thought ""Saving Private Ryan"" should have been Best Picture; sure, it's a better film, but at the time we were all so in love with Gwyneth we didn't care. First love is always the best; there will never be another love story like this one, that's for sure.

1036865,5,6305470448,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Everything about it - acting, directing, costumes, screenplay - is absolutely stunning!

The story goes as follows: young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is hassled by an in-debt theater owner to finish writing his play.  Unfortunately, Will finds himself cursed with horrible writer's block, a problem which is further aggravated by the discovery that his muse, the fair Rosaline, is cheating on him.  Then he meets Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), a young woman that yearns for the theater, but is unable to follow her dreams because of the laws against women on the stage (female roles were played by young boys).  What follows is a magnificent love story complete with mistaken identities, disguises, and laugh-out-loud comedy in which Will Shakespeare finds the inspiration to write his most romantic work: ""Romeo and Juliet"".

Every actor is superbly cast.  Joseph Fiennes has a sort of boyish charm and Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely perfect.  Both are wonderful actors that pull off the entire range of theatrical emotion (from comedy to despair) during the course of this 2 and 1/2 hour film.  Needless to say, the supporting cast (including Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, and Ben Affleck) is just as wonderful.  In addition: this is probably one of my favorite screenplays - it's extremely well written and has a perfect balance of comedy, romance, and tragedy.

Shakespeare in Love is completely worthy of it's seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Actress).  It mixes hilarious comedy and heartfelt romance and will dispel any association between the words ""Shakespeare"" and ""dull"".

Recently I had the opportunity to see the movie again, this time on DVD. The movie, although an imaginative creation, is well rooted in historical realities. Shakespeare was a commercial artist in commercial theatre, Shakespeare's plays were the popular entertainment of his day, the City of London regularly threatened the 'low brow' theatre entertainment industry with closure, Shakespeare often wrote parts for his favourite actors and his theatre's stars. All these aspects are illustrated in this rollicking screen play. And it leaves us with the question, surely Shakespeare must have been in love to write of love so passionately.

This irreverent production is actually uplifting. Shakespeare was probably the greatest artist of all time, but he wasn't an inhabitant of some ethereal Mount Olympus, he and his work is down to earth. That's what makes him and his work great.",1156809600,2,1005,5.24223602484472

It definitely helps if you are fan of Shakespeare (read English major) like I am.

The action centers around the Rose, one of the leading theaters of the period and the set they use is authentic and despite its simple nature invokes the power of theater.

The casting is inspired and each actor sets his teeth into their role with relish.  You can't say too many good things about this cast.  Judy Dench is brilliant as a gnarly old but savvy queen Elizabeth,  Joseph Fiennes is great as a floundering young Will Shakespeare and  Geoffrey Rush is inspired as the tight rope walking theater owner William Hensley.

The story line has enough twists and turns to freeze your attention waiting for the next near disaster to fall on top of Will and Hensley whether it be a cuckolded duke, a blood thirsty loan shark with a taste for the theater or the malevolent master of the revelers.

The idea is that Shakespeare is not some grave, great poet, but a young guy trying to make his way in the theatre. He's written good plays, but nothing truly transcendent. The conceit is that an ill-fated romance--the one great true love of this life--with a beautiful, smart woman is what inspires him to write his first immortal play: Romeo and Juliet.

The film never plods. The screenplay is rich with romance, emotion and action. The plot weaves several stories and themes.

 Joseph Fiennes for his boyish vulnerability

 Gwyneth Paltrow for her wide-eyed wonder and passion for life

 Judith Dench for her Imperial savior faire

These above are the exceptional performances

 Rupert Everett for his sage demeanor and a certain ""je ne sais quoi""

 Ben Afflect for charming impetuousness

 Colin Firth for reprehensible chivalry

 Geoffrey Rush for his daring love of theatre

These are the very, very good supporting roles.

This love story is so heartbreaking in such an appealing manner that you are thankful in the end that you experienced such beauty of sadness and may feel as if you can now die having at least loved deeply once.  Of course, this can only apply to those who have loved something (someone) as with one's soul AND to have been loved in return only to realize that eternal concepts such as family, duty, and fate matter more.

To quote Viola De Lesseps and William, ""But it will end well for love.  In Heaven, Perhaps.""

To quote Viola, ""I am afeared . . . being in night, all this is but a dream.  Too flattering sweet . . . to be substantial."" And also, ""This is not life, Will.  It is a stolen season.""

By the spirit of these lines, the tragic play Romeo and Juliet is analogous as subplot within the main story depicting the love of William and Viola.

Even though love is lost, it is pleasant to watch the two stories pas de deux in a frenzied fashion with the skill of Nureyev and Fonteyn  justifying Best Picture and Best Actress Oscars (and 5 others).  Sometimes, I wonder who forgot Joseph.  But, maybe I'm just fond of him (See Merchant of Venice).

films along with Emma and Sense and Sensibility( best of the three).

There was some controversy when this film beat Saving Private Ryan

for the best picture Oscar due in some part by the massive PR

blitz by Miramax Pictures.  Gwyneth Paltrow deservedly won the best

actress Oscar for her radiant performance. A brief storyline-

Shakespeare ( an excellent Joseph Fiennes) is a struggling playwright  trying to deliver a play that will be popular( i.e.

make some money for the producer ,Jeffrey Rush). Paltrow is

the marriagable daughter of a wealthy nobleman who of  course wants

her to marry the requisite low-life  suitor who is anathema to

Paltrow.  Since women are not allowed to be actors in the days'

plays, she dresses up as a boy and gets a part in Shakespeare's

play.  From there a romance with Master Shakespeare ensues.

The screenplay by Tom Stoppard is terrific as well as the

supporting players. Cinematography and score are top  drawer.

immensely.",1125619200,,1097,4.836956521739131
1037017,5,6305470448,"Madden's _Shakespeare in Love_ was written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.  Stoppard wrote (and directed the film version of) _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead_.  While that film appeals to a more intellectual or philosophical audiences (as it's based on a re-imagining of _Hamlet_, told from the perspective of two minor characters), this film plays the same ""trick,"" but appeals more to the romance evoked by its subject matter of _Romeo and Juliet_.

It would definitely help to be familiar with both Romeo and Juliet and Shakespeare's subsequent play, Twelfth Night, as the plot of _Shakespeare in Love_ weaves in and out of the characters and themes of those two plays.  It's less of an intersection with those plays and more of a ""behind-the-scenes"" of the writing of those two plays.  It cleverly takes Romeo and Juliet's focus on a love restricted by circumstance and puts it into the context of the Bard's own life.

The film does make one wonder about the historical veracity of the events depicted, yet the DVD extras don't seem to delve into that kind of investigation; perhaps our general lack of knowledge of the Bard's life is the real reason for these unanswered questions, but it would be nice to receive some sense of the ""reality"" of the events depicted in the film, without having to engage in a scholarly enterprise.  Regardless of ""truth,"" however, the film is wonderfully creative and intelligent.

Both in the theater and on DVD I felt this film lacked something, and one's love for Shakespeare does help during the times that the plot meanders about, but it doesn't affect it enough to make me drop it to four stars.  On the whole, this film is remarkably creative, intelligent, and romantic!",1125360000,,1723,4.893470790378007
1037018,5,6305470448,"There were numerous good movies that were released in 1998; ""The Truman Show"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Elizabeth"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" to name a few. However, what made ""Shakespeare in Love"" stand out from the rest of them? When I saw Shakespeare in Love, I thought it was a breath of fresh air from the usual love stories that we usually see. It stood apart from the others, because of its unique storyline, unlike anything that I had seen before.

""Shakespeare in Love"" is the story of young Will Shakespeare, who is having trouble coming up with ideas for his new play ""Romeo and Ethel: The Pirate's Daughter"". Irritated and nervous, Will suffers from this writer's block, until he meets Viola De Lesseps, whom he falls in love with. Viola is however, engaged to Lord Vessex (Colin Firth), who makes sure nothing comes in his way from marrying Viola. Meanwhile, Viola, who is in love with the theatre, disguises herself as a boy to try out for a role in Will's new play. Will they able to complete the play in time? Will ""Romeo and Juliet"" be successful and approved by anyone? Will Viola and William have their happy ending?

Winner of 7 Academy Awards (Best Picture , Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Music, Original Musical or Comedy Score), 3 Golden Globe Awards (Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, Best Screenplay - Motion Picture),  with a total of 42 wins and 59 nominations from other awards, ""Shakespeare in Love"" does not give the autobiographical life story of William Shakespeare in anyway. Instead it just tells us a simple story of a young man falling in love and getting inspired to write new work. The screenplay for this movie is without a doubt, excellent. To nicely intersperse the story of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Twelfth Night"" into this movie, was delightful to watch. It is such an exclusive concept to create a movie such as this. This film is like a rollercoaster ride, where you get too see love, comedy, tragedy, beauty, everything rolled into one!

Coming to the cast, Gwyneth Paltrow did a wonderful job in her role. She definitely deserved the Oscar for the expressions she portrayed when enacting on stage as Thomas Kent, while looking wonderful and acting gracefully as Viola. Joseph Fiennes acted great too as Will Shakespeare, and the chemistry between him and Viola was charming. Even though John Madden did not win the Oscar, he did a terrific job in directing this movie! The rest of the cast equally, such as Geoffrey Rush, Judi Dench and Colin Firth did a fine job on their roles. Rupert Everett and Ben Affleck were ok, but they didn't have much of a role in the movie anyway. Stephen Warbeck should also be credited for the beautiful background score that he created for this movie.

Anyhow, the babe and I thought handsome Joseph Fiennes a romantic young Bard, and his impossible, indeed, star-crossed love, Gwenth Paltrow, delightful.  For us fellows that have taken up the pen, Shake is a hero, and we're more than willing to imagine our less talented egos upon the master; therefore, making our pathetic literary dreams come true for at least ninety minutes.

The second time around on DVD, ah, a popular Academy Award Winner it still is, but I had more reservations.  You see, I began to desire the real thing.  I wanted to see the actual play.  I loved the set of the old Curtain Playhouse.  I wanted to see Romeo and Juliet as the 1946, Olivia production, Henry V, had duplicated a Globe presentation.

The problem, a lesser farce has been pinned to a great work of art.  It's not the writer, Tom Stoppard's fault.  I panned his Brazil, but I give him marks for a clever recreation of olden times and a romanticized Shakespeare, interesting.

Oh, Paltrow's hair, long and flowing in her family mansion, short, boy cut on stage, I don't get it.  She wears a long hair wig at home?  However, later on stage, her long hair is exposed.  You couldn't hide all those locks under a short haircut.",1113436800,,1347,4.554166666666666

The facts of `Brave Heart' were way off too. Did that stop it from earning Mel an Oscar? No it did not. Did the glaring historical mistakes prevent Shakespeare in Love from winning an Oscar? Ditto to the first answer. There are numerous problems in this film. Ben Aflec to point a few. The fact is it's hard to pull off an English accent. Most Americans simply can't perform Shakespeare no matter how hard they try. It always sounds like they are reading poetry. Much as I enjoyed viewing Gwyneth Paltrow in a moustache (anyone who thought she resembled a man in any way needs their eyes testing), I don't think she came near enough to the calibre I consider worthy of an Oscar. I much preferred Cate Blanchett in Elizabeth. I love that womans voice, its sooo deep...erm anyway apart from that the movie is crammed with unfunny jokes that the majority of the general public seem to find funny. This scares me. Like the Avon cup, the constant changing of the play title (`Romeo and Ethel The Pirates Daughter', is that amusing to you?) and peppering the script with more excerpts from his works to make the audience nod in acknowledgement: `oh I get it! I'm enjoying this film! Haw haw!'

My enjoyment of such `wit' was cut short due to the fact that in the middle of this film I suffered a violent nosebleed. No really! The incident occurred in an old theatre in Wetherby (tiny village in England). I wasn't picking my nose, I just, you know, had an itch. Anyway I caught a vein and I'm talking about blood shooting out my nose like you'd never seen before. I made a mad dash to the bathroom and, in the dark, ended up in the broom cupboard where I, in my confusion, switched all the lights on. It was a tiny family run cinema you seen. Anyway the owner came running down the isle and shoved me into the bathroom. We're talking a tiny white washroom with a toilet and a sink, no privacy whatsoever. I spent the rest of the film with my head in that very sink and lost so much blood I nearly fainted. On my way out the owner proceeded to give me 2 free tickets so that I could come and view it again. Out of pure obligation and embarrassment at having turned her friendly country establishment into a blood bath I returned the next night only to be subjected to the entire rigmarole again. Okay this review is going nowhere.  Despite what you may think, I actually enjoyed the film, especially the final sequence. It was entertaining to some extent. That's it.  I give it 3 stars for the beautiful costumes and sets, including the lovely restoration of the old rose theatre. Joseph Fines wasn't too shabby either.",1113004800,,2746,4.46613545816733
1037083,4,6305470448,"Especially when it's a tongue in cheek movie such as this one. I've seen this quite a few times, as I had the *cough* video before this. And now I have the DVD! Very happy. This was never meant to be a serious look at Shakespeare's life, so if you're looking for a biographical movie about his life, don't choose this one unless you have a sense of humour.

This is one of the movies I didn't need to switch my brain on for - not that I ever do - except to spot the obvious references to Hamlet, Twelfth Night, and just to be glaringly obvious, Romeo & Juliet. It's full of fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow repeatedly going topless. I bet she's got it written into her contracts now, that she won't be doing anymore of that now she's a mum. They're not that much to write home about anyway. And the lovely lovely (so much so it needs to be said twice) Joseph Fiennes. I don't like his brother however, but Joseph - he's got nice eyes.

There's a whole host of great actors in this, including Geoffrey Rush (who got on my nerves), Judi Dench (utterly fabulous), Martin Clunes, Imelda Staunton, Colin Firth, Ben Affleck (woooooooooo!), Rupert Everett and also look out for one of the girls from EastEnders (UK show), Lucy Speed, who used to play Natalie, credited ever so nicely as ""Second Whore"". Some of the roles, however, could have been played by Kenneth Branagh, Winona Ryder, Julia Roberts, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jodie Foster and Meg Ryan.

In the beginning of the movie, when Henslowe asks Will if he has been working on his play, and Will answers ""Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move"" he is quoting from Hamlet (Act II Scene 2). The lines are from a letter he wrote to Ophelia while pretending to have gone mad, and are followed by ""Doubt truth to be a liar, but never doubt I love."" The scene that show a woman (presumably Viola) nearly drowning in a shipwreck is a direct homage to one of the opening scenes of Twelfth Night: Or What You Will, in which the character of Viola nearly drowns. The priest near the beginning yells ""a plague on both your houses"", a famous quote from Romeo and Juliet.

There is no need to be afraid of a movie that has something to do with Shakespeare. This is one of the great films, along with 10 Things I Hate About You, that is based around Shakespeare plays - I still can't quite sit through Baz Luhrman's Romeo & Juliet however, it's just too Shakespeare sometimes. We used to do Shakespeare all the time in English at school, and every one of us girls used to have to read Juliet's lines, and every one of the guys had to read Romeo's. Boy, did we ever dread being paired up against a god-awful guy, and the endless immature teasing which came afterwards. This is a great movie, and well worth getting. The extras are awfully tedious, and not really worth blethering about. So I won't.",1107043200,2,2842,4.407619047619048
1037084,5,6305470448,"I was enthralled from the very start of the movie to the very end as I watched through it. Joseph Fiennes plays a young Shakespeare, struggling to make ends meet and suffering from a bad case of writer's block. Geoffrey Rush plays Henslow, the owner of the Rose theatre, also struggling to make ends meet. Shakespeare has promised Henslow a comedy - ""Romeo and Ethel, The Pirate's Daughter"", but the creative juices are stagnant.

Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a young, affluent woman who loves the theatre dearly, and pines to be an actress. The problem is, in Elizabethan England, women were not allowed onto the theatrical stage as it was considered an act of public lewdness. Viola disguises herself as a man, Thomas Kent, and auditions for Romeo and Ethel. Shakespeare quickly recognizes a great actor when he hears her, and pursues her, not realizing just who she is. He arrives at her estate, and sneaks in. He sees Viola as herself, not recognizing her out of disguise, and is smitten with her beauty, falling head-over-heels in love. The only problem is that she is betrothed to Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), a man she does not love.

For those of you who are in the least familiar with Romeo and Juliet, you will quickly begin to realize the basic premise of this movie. Shakespeare is a young, poor and fledgling writer with no particular reputation, writing plays based around his life experiences. It is an intriguing concept, and one which works wonderfully well on several levels. There is drama, comedy, passion and tragedy aplenty on offer here. This is deeply moving material, and movie-making at its very best, with wonderful production design, superb costuming, great music and wonderful cinematography.

What I really like is all the little side-comments, somtimes when Will hears an odd phrase as he passes through the marketplace. They are the phrases that eventually  build up into his scripts. To see this movie, you'd think that all his finest lines were stolen. Well, so be it. The finest craftsman takes the greatest pride in the quality of the material that he steals.

The 'confession' is wonderful, a workable analogy to modern psycotherapy. Dench is wonderful as Elizabeth, esp. in the final ten minutes or so. The nurse/maid (Imelda Staunton) is a quiet favorite - she serves her lady well, even when she might prefer not to.

Paltrow is lovely and catches the cadence of Elizabethan language well, even in the hottest scenes of played passion. There are a few moments, however, when it really looks as of Paltrow has implants and that they are squeezed badly out of shape by the flat-fronted costumes. I prefer the natural figures, even if there's less of them.

The movie, as a whole works. But why? ""It's a mystery.""

Shakespeare in Love is truly a comedy for the ages.

This outstanding film is much more than the sum of its very impressive parts.

Each of the cast may, justifiably, consider their work here as among the finest of their careers.

The direction is deft and smart and the staging and settings are nothing short of brilliant.

Likewise the cinematography is lush, stunning and elegant in the extreme.

Tom Stoppard's script is crisp and intelligent and is infested with clever Shakespearean references.

In its telling, Shakespeare in Love is sheer delight!

This fictional tale of young Will's romance with the beautiful Viola, set against a backdrop of the writing and premier of Romeo and Juliet, draws us in from its opening witticisms.

The characterisation is rich and warm - which further serves to engage us deeply in the unfolding narrative.

In a film jam-packed with magnificent performances, keep an eye out for Geoffrey Rush as the blundering Mr. Henslowe.

Simply superlative!

It's probably unfair to single out one star in such a luminous galaxy - all here are in fantastic form.

1037088,4,6305470448,"As a satire this movie was hugely entertaining.  Some of the plot developments were so implausible that they might have fit well into one of Shakespeare's own plays quite nicely, and I strongly suspect that the screenwriters were quite deliberate in this regard.  They also quite ruthlessly maul history when it serves their purposes --- something also to which the Bard could well relate.  The dialogue & the storyline cruise along at a wonderful pace.  Only when Will & Viola stand around getting all dreamy-eyed over each other does the movie begin to move into some dangerously cheesy territory.

But the cheesiness is kept more or less in check.  Judi Dench & Geoffery Rush turn in great supporting performances.  Colin Firth is wonderfully reptilian and one-dimensional a perfect Shakespearian villain (like Don John, for example) in many ways.  Even Ben Affleck seems moderately competent and appears capable of acting; the movie probably deserves an award simply for managing to pull that off.

Did this movie deserve 7 Oscars?  It is hard to argue that it did, because despite the great writing it is still a rather lightweight romantic comedy at its core.  However, it is a lot of fun to watch and may tempt some people actually to read up on their Shakespeare (and possibly their Marlowe as well).

1037159,3,6305470448,"Shakespeare in Love is a thoroughly researched, lovingly written and acted homage to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It is the story of how the famous play about two star-crossed and doomed lovers came to be. Screenplay writers Mark Norman and Tom Stoppard say in the DVD extras that they wondered what Shakespeare was like before he was famous. They thought as a young, struggling writer, he would be like they themselves were: poor, horny, and suffering from writer's block. Much historical research was done, and the film is very accurate in its portrayal of Elizabethan society and times. The viewer learns a lot from the wonderful DVD extras. One thing the DVD does not mention that I was waiting for it to, is the placement of Christoper Marlowe in the film. Some people think that Shakespeare's plays were in fact written by Marlowe, Shakespeare's better known playwriting contemporary, until Marlowe was killed at age 29 in a tavern brawl. Shakespeare in Love works this controversy into the film in an ingenious and enjoyable way, that might put all doubts to rest! There are steamy sex scenes in the first half, just like Romeo and Juliet, so don't be shocked.

 A large and splendid cast makes the film enjoyable and believable. There are so many good actors and actresses in this film it is impossible to list them all here. Joseph Fiennes is a wonderful young Will Shakespeare. He is the classic young lover, surprisingly nimble on his feet during fighting and escape scenes. Gwyneth Paltrow was, as the writers said, the perfect choice for Shakespeare's inspiration. They say on the DVD that she ""has a spirituality about her,"" and indeed, that spirituality shines throughout the film. Colin Firth is wonderful as the villian, the scheming Lord Wessex. And Ben Affleck almost steals the show as actor Ned Alleyn, who was a real star of the times.

 Alleyn comes complete with a posse, and that is not the only 20th century cultural reference. These many references make the film very lighthearted for the first half, almost too lighthearted. But it gets better, and becomes tragic and quite moving. Judy Dench is the icing on the cake as the stupendous Queen Elizabeth I herself. In fact, in her breathtaking costumes, she LOOKS like a cake. The costumes are one of the main reasons to see this film. The Academy Award for Best Costume Design was well-deserved, as were the other awards for Best Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress (Dench), and the three other Oscars the film received.

At the heart of it is a passionate love affair between Will Shakespeare, struggling as a playwright when the movie begins, and Viola, a wealthy young lady whose dream is to be an actor, although women were not permitted to star on the stage at the time.

Surrounding this love, which is as dramatic and hyperbolic as any found in Shakespeare's plays, are rousing sword fights, witty bantering, and plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor.  The cast of actors could not have been better chosen.  There's a bumbling Geoffrey Rush as a theater manager, and a cool and unruffled Rupert Everett as Marlowe; there's Judi Dench as the acerbic and worldly wise Queen Elizabeth, and Colin Firth as Lord Wessex, the arrogant boor who is betrothed to Viola.  Ben Affleck also manages to shine here in a small role as a prima donna of the stage, an actor who thinks he deserves only the title roles (and grumbles when he merely gets the part of Mercutio in Shakespeare's latest play...)

Originally intended as a comedy called ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,"" its mood changes to tragedy as the impossibility of his love affair dawns on Will.

1037162,5,6305470448,"""Shakespeare in Love"" is a triumph, pure and simple.  With screenwriters Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman at the top of their game and feeding immortal lines to a top-notch cast, ""Shakespeare in Love"" could not fail to succeed.
The film opens with young Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) struggling with writer's block . . . he is clearly not yet the magnificent WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE (insert trumpets here), the world's most famous writer.  Indeed, the top playwright of the age is Kit Marlowe (Rupert Everett), as Shakespeare is reminded several times.  And young Will is also hopelessly infatuated with Rosaline, a woman completely unworthy of his affections.
After some psychotherapy that anticipates Freud, Will is no better.  Still, heavily in debt, Will attempts to stage his next opus, ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.""  Working with Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush, who would have stolen a lesser film with his perfect performance), who's also heavily in debt, Will seems headed for disaster.
That is, until he sees his muse, young Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow, never better).  Smitten, young Will begins to write the romantic poetry that becomes ""Romeo and Juliet.""  Viola, who recognizes Will's genius, meets Will through some classic Shakespearean disguises and mistaken identities.  Of course, Viola is betrothed to a true slug, Lord Wessex (a plump Colin Firth), who plans to take her to Virginia in seek his fortune across the sea -- essentially sending her into exile.
Despite the roadblocks, Will and Viola are soon hopelessly in love.  Viola, daring to breach the silly rule that only men can play parts on stage, has taken the role of Romeo by day.  By night, Will and Viola write Will's most romantic play together.
""SIL"" keeps the wheels turning mighty fast, and one of the joys of watching this movie over and over is catching a quick joke that you didn't get the first time around.
It's also a pleasure to watch this stellar cast go through its paces.  While Judi Dench won her Oscar for her surprisingly brief performance as Queen Elizabeth, other actors turn in equally entertaining performances.  Tom Wilkinson, Simon Callow, Martin Clunes, and Imelda Staunton each bring amazing proficiency to the supporting cast, and even the much-maligned appearance of Ben Affleck elevates the movie -- he is perfectly cast as a self-absorbed theater star (first line -- ""What is the play, and what is my part?"").  Affleck's comeuppance, when he realizes that he, as Mercutio, doesn't have the title role, is handled wonderfully well.
This is simply a movie that doesn't miss a trick.  The film is shot beautifully, the extravagent costuming gets at the ridiculous conformity that we associate with jolly old England (and makes the torrid romance of Will and Viola that much more intimate), and the music is uplifting.
The film's final shot, as Viola walks along the beach and we realize that we've just seen the birth of arguably Shakespeare's greatest heroine, Viola of ""Twelfth Night,"" is a masterpiece of powerful understatement.

The film is really two love stories: one a bawdy romance between two smitten humans, and the other an ode to the art of theatre. The writers'/director's love for showmanship is loud and evident throughout the brilliant screenplay, and if you're a fan of wordplay in any way, well then this is a surefire delight.
Both Paltrow and Fienners turn in lusciously romantic performances in their respective roles -- she pulls off the formidable order of gender-switching without a hitch, and he has just the right pitches and patterns for a young, struggling Shakespeare. Geoffrey Rush is magnetic as usual.
Don't be fooled by the Elizabethan accoutrements, this film and its arsenal of laconic quips could easily shoot several contemporary romances to dust. Buy this one in fact, don't just rent, it quite comfortably stands the test of more than one viewing..",1089936000,2,1047,5.057803468208093

For instance, if a troop of players did a play for  Queen Elizabeth I of England, it was a special performance at the palace only for the queen and her entourage.  This movie would have you believe that the queen would actually sit with the common folk at the Globe Theater.

1037165,5,6305470448,"This won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1998. Stars Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow as the romantic partners William Shakespeare and his Muse, with Dame Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth I. This is a lush film to look at in many respects. The authentic period costumes is a nice touch. The film is mostly set in the theatre of Shakespeare's day. At this time, there were no female actresses. Only men were involved in theatre. Men played the role of women. Nowadays, it's twisted to think the first Romeo and Juliet were two men. The movie has no accuracy or truth to actual historic account. William Shakespeare was never romantically linked to the character Gwyneth Paltrow plays.
 The whole thing is a fictionalized, dramatic melodrama that never took place. William Shakespeare was married to Anne Hathaway but there is evidence he was unfaithful and loved the Jewish keyboard player ""Dark Lady"" of whom he writes about in his sonnets. The movie is merely Hollywood taking on Shakespeare and it has since been used in English courses throughout the US. Shakespeare is enacted by Joseph Fiennes who is doing a terrific job. However, I don't much care for Gwyneth Paltrow's performance, no matter how much Oscar appeal she was said to circulate. She comes off as pretty wooden and the typical romantic heroine straight out of a bodice ripper, romantic novel. All she does is fall in love for Shakespeare and even goes to the lengths of dressing as a man to be near him during production of Romeo and Juliet. Judi Dench, a sublime actress though she is, does not LOOK anything like the real Queen Elizabeth. They could have cast an actress who looked the part more truthfully. Judi Dench did a better job as England's Queen Victoria in the movie ""Mrs. Brown"". She looked exactly like her and her fastidious, overly refined manners were distinctly Victorian. And one last thing, Ben Affleck had no place in this film. Did he think he would win an Oscar too or some form of recognition ? Ben Affleck is not right for this movie, no matter how small the role. It just seemed out of place and I would have preferred to see a true Shakespearean legend in this movie like Sir Ian McKellen. But it's a movie that has a unique charm. The music is also very beautiful. Be sure and get the soundtrack if you really liked the music for this movie.",1086048000,,2335,4.640096618357488
1037166,5,6305470448,"Directed by John Madden ''Shakespeare in Love'' was the winner of 7 academy awards including Best Picture, Best atcress, and Best supporting actress.
This was a great film. The sets were good, the budget obviously was big, the acting was great by Fiennes, Paltrow, Rush and others and it was very entertaining. However the movie does have many flaws though most of which were revealed
on Special Edition DVD and by simple facts of history on Shakespeare himself.
For instance on DVD Director John Madden does mention that he takes
liberties with the film, including the depiction of future playwright John Webster as a street beggar, who gets turned by William Shakespeare. In fact, half of the film takes many liberties which scholars will debate as untrue.
For one is the depiction in which Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everette) seems to be the one that gives Will, all the ideas to write ''Romeo and Juliet'', including the characer of Mercutio and Romeo. I asked this to my English teacher who is
a big Shakespeare buff and researched this and could find no proof that Marlowe
even met with Shakespeare. So these events in the film stretched the truth.
The other liberty the film takes is depicting Shakespeare as a heterosexual , who loves women, when in fact, the real Shakespeare loved not only women, but young boys. Shakespeare was a bisexual but you research his background, you'll
(...)
his Sonnets, for an unknown young man.
The good points of the film is that several depictions of Elizabethan life are factual.
Throughout the 13 to 1600's, the plays written by Shakespeare and Marlowe were largely unknown. Since, the Bubonic Plague was rampant this also
posed a problem for potential audiences.
Elizabethan theatres, like Shakespeare, chronically were unsactioned and held gambling and prostitution in between and after plays.
There is also the debate of Viola De Lesseps(Gwenyth Paltrow's character) who falls in love with Shakespeare. In fact my English colleagues, told me, that there is
no proof that Viola ever existed.
Shakespeare in Love is about young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) who is struggling to make his new play (which would end to be ''Romeo and Juliet'')
to make ends meet.
His friend and business partner Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) is literally almost killed for the debts he owes , along with the fact that the theather he manages
has failed to show a profit. Shakespeare, then with a little help from Chris Marlowe,
(Scholars say that Shakespeare didn't even know Marlowe) gets the idea to make ''Romeo and Juliet'' (his most famous love tragedy).
Everything from the beginning goes wrong to make the play until Shakespeare finds a good actor named Thomas kent who is really a woman played named Viola De Lesseps (Gwenyth Paltrow).
Shakespeare at first doesn't know that Kent is a woman, but when he does, is when the funny action starts. However, all is not well, as Viola is in love a loveless
engagement with another man Lord Wesses (Colin Firth).
The famous playwright then must know find a way to finish his play and not lets his feelings get in the way for Viola, because it could mean the end of his life.
As I said the movie takes many liberties with the ''facts'' of Shakespeare, and more than half of the movie is filled with uncomfirmed, evidence on Shakespeare.
As I said, Shakespeare had an incredible desire for young boys, and it's illogical that Shakespeare would have fallen for this woman Viola so rapidly in the film.
In fact, there is part of the film that does show some of Shakespeare, homosexuality. The film also inaccurately says that Chris Marlowe and
Shakespeare well old friends, but against there is no evidence showing that.
Despite that, ''Shakespeare in Love'' is a pretty entertaining film that showcases what life was like during Shakespeare's time.
The DVD for the film comes with many extras including:
* A special feature on the making of the film
* A special look at the costumes made for the film.
* Over 5 Deleted scenes.
*Commentary from the Director.
*A special section showing a couple of facts on the real Shakespeare and much more.

the movie is great and only once i've gone through the commentary tracks did i realize how truly amazing the script really is (if you're a shakespeare scholar you'd have realized that without the commentary tracks i suppose). indeed the tracks are very informative, one is by director john madden and one by cast & crew, which is an mix of interviews and separate commentaries made by each individual. most noteworthy to listen to is the evil executive producer-cum-groupie julie goldstein who really sounds like a hollywood suit trying to tamper with the movie but talks about how she came to 'see the light' and let the movie be made the way it was written.
the featurette is great, talking about shakespeare on film and showing clips of other shakespeare movies. the trailers and tv spots are disgusting, the costume design featurette is nice and the deleted scenes are really interesting to see (especially the one of viola in america).
if you haven't read all of shakespeare's plays yet then a lot of the comedy will be lost on you, this is where the commentaries come in, they explain how everything fits in together and will cause you to laugh about a lot more things. indeed i change my mind about what i wrote at the beginning. this movie DID deserve the oscar.",1080432000,,1276,4.700892857142857

I felt I was in the hands of a master from the first act onward.
About halfway in events started to occur in a sort of collage, with Gwyneth playing Romeo and all the cast knowing that she was not what she appeared.. The number of characters and variables in play is something rarely attempted and quite disarming and enchanting when done right..  This was a very ambitious and beautiful project.
I only wish it had a happy ending. But as with the Play within the play only one conclusion.  And so the audience sees both the euphoria as well as the breakup.  We've all been there.

1037231,5,6305470448,"My first reaction to this movie was that it wasn't that great, but just overhyped.  It was as if I subconsciously wanted to hate it!  But I ended up saying to myself at the end, Goodness, Shakespeare's awesome.  I loved how Shakespeare's words were used so artistically whenever he thought about Paltrow's character.  It was shocking how much this movie made me appreciate Shakespeare's use of language and beautiful words.
The synopsis is easy: It's an affair story surrounded by the hopeful opening of Shakespeare's new play, Romeo and Juliet, which is named after a few crazy ideas.  They continue to fall in love until a powerful man from Virginia ruins their plans.
The acting was phenominal.  Mostly by Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush and Judi Dench.  The best out of the three was Judi Dench, playing a wonderfully grumpy Queen Elizabeth.  Although the role was only eight minutes long, she most deservadly recieved Oscar gold.  Gwyneth did not really earn her Oscar over Cate Blanchett.  I think that on the silver screen, rather than the television screens, where most voters watched the movies with DVD's they had recieved, Cate Blanchett would appear more powerful than Gwyneth.  I still thought Paltrow was great, despite Blanchett's beautifully flawless perfomance.
Bottom Line: This movie is a classis play on Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" that will forever be remembered for its great acting and wonderful story. (I give it an A- and five out of five stars.)",1062460800,,1475,5.02880658436214
1037232,5,6305470448,"It is easy to see why Shakespeare in Love won so many awards in 1998. The only problem was perhaps that Joseph Fiennes, for the role of William Shakespeare, was largely ignored. Still, this is a film that truly deserves all the accolades that it received, and Gweneth Paltrow was excellent as Viola, the woman that Shakespeare falls in love with.
Although purely a fictitious story, there is so much Victorian and Shakespeare flavor to this that gives it its authenticity. This is a movie that is both romantic and humorous. Shakespeare, because of writer's block, goes to seek advice from a counselor about his inability to come up with a script. That is, until he meets Viola De Lesseps (Gweneth Paltrow), who inspires him to writing.
One of the great things I noticed upon a second viewing of this was the many allusions to Shakespeare's plays. For instance, a man opposing the theatre is on a platform and yells ""A plague on both their houses"" (which is a reference to Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet). Later, Shakespeare, while thinking, mutters the phrase ""words, words, words"" a la Hamlet.
The plot is cleverly contrived, as they pick through the details of Shakespeare existence and are able to use the story to explain several events of his life. For example, Shakespeare meets and speaks with fellow Victorian writer and rival Christopher Marlowe in a tavern and they discuss their upcoming plays. (Marlowe gives Shakespeare a little advice for Romeo and Ethel, the Pirates Daughter...before it was Romeo and Juliet).  We also see the troubles that Shakespeare and playwrights had in keeping playhouses open due to radicals against it and the plague scourge, as well as the injustice that women had in not being able to participate in plays (Viola dresses up like a young boy to play a part). Shakespeare is away from his wife Anne Hathaway and his children because he wants to think about writing.
The way it is presented is in the form of the play Romeo and Juliet, so, in a way, it is a play within a movie. But, still, the main feature of the film is telling or basing a tale about Shakespeare's life and time. The fact that it is not an accurate depiction of Shakespeare's life is insignificant. This is an exceptional movie for the Shakespeare aficionado and anyone who wants to see an intelligent romantic comedy.",1059523200,3,2327,4.75990099009901
1037233,5,6305470448,"Coincidentally, I saw this film and then Elizabeth on consecutive evenings when they both were released in 1998. In the years since, I have not changed several initial reactions which serve as an introduction to this brief commentary. Here are three. First, both deserve all the praise they have received. Second, this film is far more entertaining but that Elizabeth has greater dramatic impact. And finally, then and now, I think Saving Private Ryan should have received the Academy Award that year which was presented to Shakespeare in Love.
The basic situation is that young Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is struggling to overcome writer's block at the worst possible time, given his financial situation and (worst yet) the near-bankrupt status of ""The Rose"" theatre in which his plays are performed. The owner, Phillip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush), is hounded by especially nasty and persistent creditors. Meanwhile, Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) has been informed by her father that she will marry Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) and live in Virginia. Viola has a strong attraction to the stage at a time when all parts were played by men and boys. She also feels an attraction to Shakespeare whose work she admires.
He finally begins to write ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.""  Disguised as a young man, Viola is selected to play Romeo. (Believe it or not, no one recognizes her.) Meanwhile, she (as Viola) and Shakespeare have fallen in love and also feel increasing desperation as her marriage to Wessex approaches. After all manner of complications, the play is finally performed, with Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) in the audience. And then....
This is a thoroughly entertaining film which captures not only the ""look"" but the ""feel"" of the London theatre world during the Elizabethan era. Under John Madden's direction, the acting is first-rate. Paltrow and Dench received Academy Awards as did those responsible for best original screenplay, art and set decoration, and costume design. It really does seem as if we are there in London, walking through its lively and colorful streets, stopping occasionally for a lubricated conversation with Shakespeare, Henslowe, Richard Burbage or Christopher Marlowe. I especially enjoyed  observing rehearsals and then the performance of ""Romeo and Ethel"" in the authentically recreated theatre.

1037234,5,6305470448,"""Shakespeare In Love"" has to be one of the most romantic movies I have ever watched. You are immediately are drawn to the characters and into their lives.
The film revolves around William Shakespeare and his quest to write another play. With competition all around him, he knows that his next play must be something great! The other main character in this film is Gwyneth Paltrow's character, who loves the words that Mr. Shakespeare writes. Paltrow's character disguises herself as a man in order to audition for a role in Shakespeare's upcoming play. Soon the two characters are falling head over heels in love, which would be wonderful, but Paltrow's character has been promised to another and she must fulfill her duties in order to save her family.
The chemistry between Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow is electric! They really make you believe that they're in love and cannot get enough of each other. Even though I didn't like the ending very much, I would definitely recommend this film! There is definitely a reason why this film won the best picture award at the Oscars - it's just plain wonderful!!!!",1054771200,2,1114,4.868421052631579
1037235,3,6305470448,"Shakespeare in Love is entertaining as comedy and romance, but the big problem is the utter fictitiousness of the story.  Well it wasn't all fictional:  There was a man named William Shakespeare and he did write a play called ""Romeo and Juliet"", but other than that....
  So much effort (or money at least) was put into this film  (the sets and wardrobes are excellent Elizabethan recreations) that it all seems a bit of a waste.  The acting was competent, but two dimensional on the part of Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes.  Paltrow did get the accent down well (most viewers thought she was really British), but it felt like her heart really wasn't in the thing.  And I didn't believe for a second that Fiennes was Shakespeare.
  The story tells how Shakespeare has writers' block (does anyone really believe he ever had it?) while trying to write a play called ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"".  Of course a major distraction from enjoying the film is that here William basically invents the play directly from his life at the time, based on his relationship with Paltrow (who initially is the actor of Romeo).  But reality tells us the fictional story of ""Romeus and Juliet"" goes back at least 100 years (from Italy) before this, and actually back over 1000 years (from Greece as ""Pyramis and Thisbe"").  The question is why did Stoppard ignore the historical reality to do this?
  What was good about the film was actually showing the play coming together, the rehearsals, all the way up to the debut performance, and if you know the play well these parts are interesting.  But we keep getting the distraction of this William-Viola parallel to the play, not to mention the Duke who keeps barging onto the scene.  I would've loved this if they stuck to historical fact...and perhaps got different actors.
  Finally Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth is good, but again her dialogue doesn't ring true.  I understand this was meant to be kind of a parody, but I think they went way overboard.
  At least there are some good sex scenes and the surreal ""Twelfth Night"" ending was well done also.",1052784000,2,2099,4.740331491712707

Gywenth Paltrow plays a young noblewoman who is expected to be demurely betrothed, but who wants none of the life ahead of her.  She yearns for the theater, and, in her headstrong, ambitious drive, dresses like a boy to obtain a part in Will Shakespeare's newest drama.  Of course, the two fall in love (hence the title!) and their duplicity leads to plot complications that get more and more outrageous.  Literary jokes abound, but you don't need to know a whit about Shakespeare to enjoy this romp.  This is a romantic comedy cloaked in Elizabethian times, an anachronism that is thoroughly satisfying.
Paltrow's Viola is gutsy, intelligent, and torn, a portrayal that deservedly earned her an Oscar.  Joseph Fiennes makes a lovable, bumbling Will Shakespeare.  The two display a chemistry that brings the witty script to life and elevates this film to a level above most romantic comedies.

 Back to the movie, it is really difficult to begin with something, so numerous are the qualities of this movie.
It is simply THE GREATEST SCREENPLAY of all times, with countless gems, witty lines, twists (it is NOT PREDICTABLE OF ALL!), a really luminous down ending(which is a very rare thing). EVERYBODY, BUT I MEAN EVERYBODY, has something ""to eat"" in this movie!...No character is here by chance, from the kid John Webster to Will Shakespeare, the appearance of every character has some meaning. And the development of the plot, reallly of Shakespearean quality, is interweaved magnificently with Romeo and Juliet, the play wich we rediscover in this movie('cause too often we think we've seen all and we know everything about Shakespeare's plays but really we DON'T). It takes a genius of the dimensions of Tom Stoppard(let's not forget Marc Norman) to make this kind of devilishly clever script...
 The Academy made, in that year, maybe one of it's smartest choices(alongside of the year when they gave the Oscar to Ordinary people). ""Saving private Ryan"" seemed to have  the upper hand. It was very ""american"", with a patriotic message, spectacularly directed, and it was representing a very ambitious to win Steven Spielberg(probably  the most powerful man in film industry right now). But no, the Academy voters were not stupid. They KNEW, they understood very well that Ryan had virtually no plot(or at least it looked like a heavy handed, mechanical , predictable plot, with a cheesy patriotic ending).
  On the other hand , Shakespeare in love had all the odds against it. Released in december, it was representing nobody(except for Bob Weistein, the Miramax boss). John Madden was a nobody, Tom Stoppard was not very well known in America, Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow were not very known and beloved in America(compared to Tom Hanks), it was a British period piece...Some would have said ""Come on, you really expect this to win over Saving private Ryan?!"" But it did...Deservedly...  Shakespeare in love has definitely the greatest original score of all times. I really cannot praise enough how great the music composed by Stephen Warbeck for this movie is...
The last twenty minutes in the movie are really one of the greatest moments of cinemamaking in history, and the final shot is THE GREATEST SINGLE FINAL SHOT OF ALL TIMES...

I am an avid fan of horror movies and was so pleasantly surprised by this film. It is not merely a comedy, nor merely a retelling of a Shakespearean tale, though it incorporates both comedy and Shakespearean text; it simply transcends what films are normally able to achieve for me. I really liked the fact that there are so many little things that the fan of Shakespeare can pick up on that enhances the comedy and wit, but are in no way necessary for the enjoyment of the film. This, in itself, is a testament to the talent of the writers and director, to be able to produce such a layered piece of art that works on so many levels and is entertaining, regardless of the viewer's knowledge of Shakespeare and his work. Everything seems to fit exactly where it is, which I find not to be the case with most films. The performances really steal the show, however.

1037383,4,6305470448,"When Shakespeare In Love swept the board at the Oscars, it was more than a little surprising, not least because it was an intelligent and learned and decidedly un-American piece of filmmaking.  Not celebrated with the bombast of previous Oscar-winners there were more than a few puzzled questions as to why such a movie won so many awards.  The simple answer is that it is brilliant, a dazzling example of what the romantic comedy should be and something that will take you quite by surprise.  The story concerns Will Shakespeare (Fiennes) as he struggles to write a new play, Romeo and Ethel, The Pirate's Daughter.  He only finds his inspiration though when Lady Viola dresses herself as a man to win the lead in the production and steals the playwright's heart.
Rather than simply being a cheap gimick where love again proves to conquer all, the story of the two young lovers draws innumerable parallels with the play itself.  As Viola is set to marry Lord Wessex (Firth) and Will is already married himself, the romance not only seems but is in fact doomed, and so the play moves from the light comedy and farce to something far more tragic and ultimately more affecting.  It's not often that it is the intelligence of the script that bowls you over about a movie, but Shakespeare In Love is one such rare example.  Anyone familiar with the play will notice several direct quotations of the play coming from Will and Viola's mouths and the parallels are so cleverly drawn it's a marvel.  In this kind of situation it would have been all too easy to go all the way and have the lovers die, but the tragedy of their separation proves to be upsetting enough.  Indeed, where have Shakespeare's themes of eternal love and self-sacrifice been any more universally evoked than here.  And it is in this universitality that the film achieves its goals, because you can identify with the lovers when they separate in a way that it is impossible to identify with the fairytale of Romeo and Juliet's deaths.
But by praising the script it is by no way to undermine the acting here.  Fiennes is great, full of brooding intensity and genius as Shakespeare, gradually moulded by the experience portrayed in the movie.  Paltrow again proves that she is one of the most luminous actresses of her generation in another literary adaptation to complement her startling turn as Estella in Great Expectations and no doubt her forthcoming portrayal of Sylvia Plath in Ted and Sylvia.  Dench is also very impressive in an Oscar-winning turn that lasted all of 8 minutes, yet even more surprising is that up-and-coming Ben Affleck doesn't seem out of place as a vain young actor who plays the part of Mercutio.
This is the kind of intelligent movie that you wish there was more of, but as it is this is a quite startling film that is at the same time unassuming and subtle.  Never going over the top yet managing to create a firm reaction in its audience this is, quite simply, alongside Luhrman's version, one of the best Shakespeare adaptations of the 90's.",1042502400,7,3037,4.70566037735849
1037384,4,6305470448,"i rented ""shakespeare in love"" because i heard it was a good film, and because it won best picture.  yes, ""saving private ryan"" is better, but you really can't compare the two movies on the same level.  ""ryan"" is about companionship and the brutality of war, while ""shakespeare"" is about... well, shakespeare.  with that said, onto the review:
okay, it was promoted as a romantic comedy, but the comedy elements aren't all there.  true, there are some good one-liners (ben affleck's ""woman"" line kills me.  i won't say anymore for those of you who have not seen it.), but some of the lines seem a little forced to the point of hokiness (i.e. ""the show must..."" / ""go on!"").  however, it is a romantic comedy, not a comedy, so the romance must come first.  after all, wouldn't pretty much every comedy be considered a romantic comedy, as everything has the underlying theme of love, yet the comedy takes precedence?  well, anyway there are funny parts.
yes, it is a romantic film.  for those who have said that the relationship is merely lust, they probably need to watch the movie again.  true, there is a lot of sex in the movie, but there are definitely great romantic themes in it.  i remember being able to relate to the characters in their desire to see and be with each other, and any movie that can strike a chord like that is at least half-way decent.  i watched the movie twice (i believe, it's been awhile.), and i would like to watch it again to make sure the relationship is not just dominated by lust.  by the way, romance aside, miss paltrow has a fabulous body, so if you want to see her naked, there's the bait.
lastly, for all you cynics that have pointed out the film's chronological errors, do you forget that in fact, william shakespeare may not have written all the plays with he is credited?  there is speculation that sir francis bacon may have penned some of his works, and others argue that one man could not have known so many things about so many different places, as represented in shakespeare's work.  pointing out small errors made by screenwriters seems to be a favorite pastime among persons with small genitalia, so forget them and think about what i just said about mr. shakespeare.  chronological errors, indeed.
i'm not a fan of shakespeare, but i'm a fan of this movie.  it is worth a try if you like romance, theatre, or naked gwyneth paltrow... so i guess it's fun for the whole family.  enjoy.",1038009600,2,2433,4.566820276497696

It's a compelling (and fictional) story that tells how Shakespeare might have been inspired to write ""Romeo and Juliet.""  There's this theatre that's on the verge of bankruptcy when its last two shows flop.  Desperate for a hit, they turn to (a young) William Shakespeare (Joe Finnes) who is tapped to write a play.  He suffers from writer's block before he crosses paths with this beautiful woman (Gwyneth Paltrow, in her umpteenth British role) who is already engaged to some other bloke (Colin Firth).  They begin a romance, and suddenly he is inspired to complete the play, which becomes a hit.  The film soared on the strength of its performances.  Dame Judi Dench was deliciously good in her semi-controversial 8-minute performance as the Queen; Paltrow holds her own throughout the film, as does Finnes.  Heck, even Ben Affleck, in a minor role, isn't half bad.

I'm of the opinion it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and should have received one for director John Madden.  He pulled performances from his actors that were breathtaking in their rightness and consistency, and he brought a forward motion to the film that only enhanced its roots.  I know a little of Shakespeare so caught many of the beautiful script's touchstones (most of which I attribute to Tom Stoppard rather than Marc Norman), but that knowledge was not necessary to enjoy the story.  Madden brought to it a sense of urgency and discovery that still amazes me, even without considering it was only his second film.
The actors deserve as much praise as you want to give them -- especially Judi Dench, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes -- for bringing heart and life to characters that could easily have become charactures.
To me there is no question which is the better film, vis-a-vis ""Saving Private Ryan"".  While technically amazing in its first twenty minutes (after the God-awful opening bookend), SPR was little more than another edition of ""Indiana Jones"" with real carnage.

Shakespeare in Love is a rich comedy that offers a fictional behind-the-scenes look at the making of Romeo and Juliet.  At the same time, there is a sense of tragedy in the pairing of the star-crossed lovers of Shakespeare and Viola, who know that their love cannot last.
Events in the movie often involve Shakespearean devices, in particular the idea of women disguising themselves as men, which the Bard used repeatedly.  There are also pokes at the quirks of modern life which add to the fun.
This movie won a Best Picture Oscar, which was considered controversial because it beat Saving Private Ryan.  Good as that latter movie was, this one merits its victory with its superior writing and acting.  This is a great movie that holds up well over time.",1019433600,4,840,4.687074829931973
1037437,5,6305470448,"Shakespeare in Love is the David that toppled the Goliath, Saving Private Ryan, in the 1999 Oscar race. It won seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actress [Gwenyth Paltrow] and Best Supporting Actress [Judi Dench] vs. Ryan's five awards. Both are great movies, and the Steven Spielburg war epic may be technically the better one. I think Shakespeare in Love won because it is not a film you revere or admire. It is one you love.
What we have here is a lark, a frolic, a bawdy Elizabethan romp played by a cast that's as first rate as they come. It has some fine dramatic moments, but it is, first and foremost, a highly original romantic comedy. The year is 1593. Will Shakespeare is in London struggling with writer's block, as well as poverty. To make matters worse, the city is just getting over another bout with the plague. Public places, such as theaters, have been closed for weeks, and the owner of The Rose, the playhouse where Will's plays are performed, is in desperate need of a hit. Shakespeare claims to have nearly finished a comedy called Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
In a mansion across town lives the beautiful Viola, whose wealthy father is planning to marry her off [with an enormous dowry] to the cash-poor Lord Wessex. The insipid Wessex will get Viola and a lot of gold, and Dad will get a title. In those days, women had no say in little things like their entire futures Viola seems resigned to her fate, yet she's a high-spirited spot. One day she goes to one of Queen Elizabeth's palaces to see a performance of some of Shakespeare's work, which she already knows by heart. Soon afterwards, she dresses as a boy and auditions for Will's new play. She has no other option, as men in those days played both the male and the female roles. Actresses didn't exist. She gets the part of Romeo. One thing leads to another, and the fallout started by Viola's, as well as Will's, deception starts coming in fast, furious and madcap waves.
Then there is that cast. It is what elevates the movie far beyond what it should have been. Gwyneth Paltrow is extraordinary as Viola. While other young actresses appear to have built their careers in a random way, Ms. Paltrow seems to have used each successive role as a building block. Ironically, her only real competition for the Oscar was Cate Blanchette, who played Queen Elizabeth in another movie. The Best Supporting Actress here is Judi Dench who plays, yes, Queen Elizabeth. In another odd twist, Dench was nominated the previous year for Best Actress in Mrs. Brown, in which she played that other big Queen, Victoria. Joseph Fiennes, who sparkles as Will Shakespeare, also played Cate Blanchett's lover in Elizabeth. As Lord Essex, Colin Firth plays one of the funniest villains we've seen in some time. Also marvelous are Geoffrey Rush and Tom Wilkinson as Henslow and Fenneyman.
The dialog is so clever that only upon the second viewing did I realized how much I had missed. The scenery and costumes are sumptuous. Stephen Warbeck's musical score is a classic. It also won an Oscar.
Shakespeare in Love is not a parody of the Bard. It is a tribute to him and his time. This is not history. We have no record of Viola. Wessex plans to take her off to his plantation in the Virginia colony. This would have been quite a feat, since the colony was not founded until fourteen years after the movie takes place. None of this matters a bit. We know very little about Shakespeare. In fact, we know next to nothing. It is doubtful that what we know as Romeo and Juliet could have evolved in this fasion. We know that this remarkable tale is pure fiction, but we wish with all our hearts that it had really happened.",1016755200,4,3694,4.6155015197568385
1037438,5,6305470448,"I loved this movie. I thought going into it that understanding Shakespeares' style and manner of speech would be difficult for me to understand, but not at all. Much credit has to go to the many talented and likeable actors who brought this story to life. On one level, this story describes (with the vital and enthusiastic endorsement of Queen Elizabeth) the very roots of show business and how troups of actors coalesced into an industry. But this movie at its heart is a good old-fashioned bittersweet love story with lots of laughs to lighten it up. Very loosely based of Shakespeare's early years as a writer/actor this story made clever use of at least a half dozen real persons who were a part of his world. That said, for some serious Shakespeare buffs to chaffe over variances with precise historical accuracy is to miss the point. Elizabethian times were not easy, certainly not very sanitary, and this film conveyed convincingly by way of costume and set design how daily life might have played out in 1593. Joseph Fiennes' Will Shakespeare was likeable, handsome, full of youthful energy and possessed of a boundless intellect. Gwyneth Paltrow positively glowed as the fictional Viola. In this role she had to at times act cross gender and in doing so demonstrated a remarkable range and talent, most deserving of the Academy Award she won. Geoffrey Rush, the superb Australian actor was brilliant as Philip Henslowe the fatalistic and comical theatre owner. (In real life, Henslowe married his way out of indentured service and was mentioned in Shakespeare's will). Noteworthy is Judi Dench's famous 8 minutes of screen time so believable as Queen Elizabeth that she won best supporting actress. This movie worked on so many levels that you are bound to find something to like about it.

It is very interesting to see these types of movies and think ""Hey, what if this is how it really happened!"". I am a big fan of comedies that have stupid humor and political humor, like Monty Python and Mel Brooks. This movie had plenty of that. There's just something about hearing jokes in the kind of accent they used that makes them so funny. It kept me wanting to watch more, even when the mushy stuff was going on.
I've never really been a fan of romantic/love based movies. I don't like seeing other peoples relationships that go so well, when it's never like that in real-life, for most of us anyway. It wasn't too bad though.
Besides that part of it, the acting was really great. You can almost imagine this coming out of a history book. They took the roles, actions, and the look of the people of that time and played them out so well, I couldn't believe it. I also enjoyed the actors using the Old English. Normally it would be hard for me to understand, but after my English teacher had us watch and read ""Macbeth"", I actually understood what they were saying. It was quite scary.
All in all, this was an excellent movie. In my personal opinion, any of the characters from Monty Python would have made perfect roles for Philip Henslowe and the actors in Will's play. They have experience in impersonating women. So, if you like stupid humor, great Old English acting, and you don't mind a whole lot of kissing (when the woman is occasionally dressed like a man...), you should see this movie.",1013126400,,1658,4.457236842105263

Gwyneth Paltrow is so sweet and likable as Viola, Joseph Fiennes is great as Shakespeare, who seems to speak with a poetic twist on everything he says, and Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck, and others are all fantastic in their supporting roles. The inside jokes for those that know their Shakespeare are just icing on the cake. Saving Private Ryan was an excellent film, but ,personally, I was happy to see Shakespeare in Love take Best Picture.

The supporting cast with Geoffry Rush as Henslowe, Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, Ben Affleck as Ned Alleyn, and Tom Wilkinson as Hugh Fennyman make their characters memorable, even with, in some cases, small roles.  As good as the film is by itself, it becomes more interesting if you know your Shakespeare and Renaissance history.  There are tons of small references.  John Webster is a playwrite working a little after Shakespeare who makes an appearance in the film (hint: rats).  Christopher Marlowe, a contemporary of Shakespeare, is a minor character.  And there are numerous references to various Shakespeare plays.

1037511,5,6305470448,"This is the kind of movie the Academy loves and through its love, rewards.
The script by Stoppard and Norman is erudite and cunning, passionate and playful, filled with witticisms by and about the Bard; and the parallels to Shakespeare and his work, especially the play within a play, Romeo and Juliet, and the play to come, Twelfth Night, are marvelous and a bit miraculous.  The romantic direction by Madden conjures up an Elizabethan England and its London theatre with enough lusty color to delight the poet himself.  The acting is wonderful with Gwyneth Paltrow conquering a very demanding and delightful four-part role as Viola/Tom Kent, and on the stage as first Romeo and then as Juliet!  Joseph Fiennes as the young Shakespeare writing his Romeo and Juliet on the fly, fired with the energy from his adulterous love for the lovely Viola, is better than advertised.
Of course what would a Shakespearean play or a great Hollywood movie be without its bit players and supporting roles?  Judi Dench as the queen in her Academy Award winning performance gives the impression of somebody doing something marvelously well but with such ease as to look unemployed.  (I stole that line from somewhere.)
From the gutter snipe with his rodents to the queen's bad teeth, from Colin Firth's delightfully villainous Lord Wessex to Geoffrey Rush's wise, but bumbling stage manager, from the tavern trollops to the gentry at the ball (in which the sonnet within a play from Romeo and Juliet is once again given life by Fiennes and Paltrow) everything is expertly presented.  You don't have to be a Shakespearean buff to appreciate this resplendent romantic comedy, but if you are, your experience will be enhanced.

Joseph Fiennes also gives a memorable performance, even though he was snubbed at the Osacars.

1037514,4,6305470448,"When ""Shakespeare In Love"" won the Oscar for best picture, beating out Saving Private Ryan, I figured it must be an exceptionally good picture. This was before I saw it. Not to say that this film isn't good, but it certainly doesn't invoke the sense of deep thought and emotion that Saving Private Ryan did.
The two pictures are certainly different. This one is an accurate portrayal of late 16th century London, where we find the young Shakespeare with a serious case of writer's block. He desperately needs to come up with a new play for some much needed money, and his inspiration comes when he sees Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) and falls, well, in love.
Viola is a great fan of literature and plays, and wants nothing more than to act in one. However, at the time, women were not allowed to act, and so she has to disguise herself as a young man (this added to the comedic aspect of the film, and was even charming). Needless to say, Viola ends up being cast as Juliet in Shakespeare's new play, and it is fun to watch the two act together on stage, because no one else knows who Juliet really is.
In terms of a romantic comedy, this movie does very well. It is full of the witty dialogue and genuine, intellectual humor that is found only in the best of movies. The only problem I have with the romance in this movie is the amount of kissing. The camera can't seem to get away from them. The relationship between Viola and Shakespeare seems built more around lovey-dovey kissing than anything else.
In all other ways, however, the film succeeds. The play, when it is finally acted out, is a superb climax. The whole movie is lighthearted and fun, and would be suitable for all ages were it not for the sexual overtones.",991267200,,1724,4.476190476190476

Score: 87/100
In the year of 1998, Shakespeare in Love gathered 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture and proved that it wasn't only the big money-making/period pieces/war films/'human' dramas etc., but the comedies also get a special mention, and Shakespeare in Love deserves a very special mention because it is such a greatly moving film with plenty of romance and a bag full of laughs!
Will Shakespeare's (Joseph Fiennes) life is going badly. His love life is a shambles, he's always short of money, and worst of all, he has writer's block. He's supposed to be nearly finished his newest play, ""Romeo and Ethel the Sea Pirate's Daughter"", but in fact he hasn't written a line. At a sham audition for the play, he admires a new actor, Thomas Kent, who suddenly runs away. Soon Shakespeare meets Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), who lives in the same stately home as Thomas; it's love at first sight and he's inspired to begin writing the play. But by the time he realises that Thomas is Viola in disguise, she's promised in marriage to a lord, which means that Queen Elizabeth herself expects the marriage to happen. But Will and Viola find their attraction too strong to resist; they risk the wrath of her fiance with a clandestine affair, and of the law against women on stage by having ""Thomas"" play Romeo. No wonder he ends up changing the play into a tragedy...
John Madden's direction is solid and his take on how Romeo and Juliet came to be one of the most romantically engaging stories of all time is portrayed with dazzling style and emotional feeling. In fact, the film may be even better than the Romeo and Juliet film, which is quite astonishing and shows the film has astounding power. The only flaw in the film is its useless swordfights which create hardly any tension and involve Ben Affleck, who is very good in this film. The other actors are also extremely impressive, Joseph Fiennes commendable turn as Shakespeare is highly entertaining to watch, Gwyneth Paltrow is a lovely romantic touch, although not half as good as Cate Blanchett, the more deserving winner for 1998's Best Actress Oscar. Not to worry, though, Paltrow is still impressive, as is Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth and Judi Dench, the movie's highlight as the argumentative and witty queen.
Fabulously bold and endlessly handsome, Shakespeare in Love is a great way to spend 2 hours of your day. But just one warning, you'll be spending more than 2 hours with this film.

The movie centers around a historical period of Shakespeare's life (the episode in which he is writing ""Romeo And Juliet"").  The film includes many historical personages, such as the famous poet Christopher Marlowe and the stage actors Ned Alleyn and Richard Burbage [one of the most popular Shakespeare actors of all time].  The inclusion of Judi Dench (arguably the most famous Shakespeare actresses alive) as Queen Elizabeth was pure genius.
The plot of the movie focuses on a love affair between Shakespeare and a fictional women (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) who turns out to be the perfect muse for S' writer's block.  The inquiry into what is the impetus for the creative output of the artist is fascinating.  In many ways, the movie reminds me of Thomas Mann's ""Lotte In Weimer"";  in his novel, it is Goethe's talents which get put ""under the microscope.""
What makes this movie truly outstanding is that it's so well done.  It has the tone of a Shakespearian comedy - an utterly brilliant touch.  This movie could have so easily been a sham if left in the hands of a less capable director and inferior actors.  Paltrow's performance, in particular, really makes this movie sing.  The soundtrack gives the pace of the film a nice flow.
Here is the type of tasteful movie that the cultured among us have been waiting for for so long.  Another movie like this won't come out for at least another 10 years.

However, I refrain from giving it a full five stars because as brilliant as it was, it just was not quite as brilliant as everyone said it was. Gwyneth Paltrow was lovely and charming, but she was not quite as luminous as everyone gushed (in my opinion). The story of Shakespeare fighting writer's block and looking for a muse and falling in love with Viola de Lesseps was an inspired storyline. The cast, from Geoffrey Rush to Rupert Everett as Shakespeare's rival Christopher Marlowe to Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, is excellent all around. Joseph Fiennes is the truly luminous performer here, showing Shakespeare as a man of passion and inspiration but all too human nevertheless.

Obviously, artistic license is the catchword here, but watching Shakespeare's inspiration unfold in this film is fun and exciting. It was amusing to hear lines from the play pop up throughout the film's story (""A plague on both your houses!"") As for the players, Paltrow was fine (but an Oscar-winning performance, I think not), Ben Affleck is strong, Geoffrey Rush is hilarious, and Joseph Fiennes is an attractive Bard whose portrayal I found unexpected and interesting.

Later, however, Will meets Viola, he gets his creative muse back, and the film suddenly becomes MAGICAL. And it's exactly this kind of resonance between the plot and the film's direction that gives ""Shakepeare in Love"" that ineffable quality that distinguishes an Academy Award winner. This film went head-to-head with odds-on favorite ""Saving Private Ryan"" and WON; and although ""Saving Private Ryan"" was a powerful and devastating project, ""Shakespeare in Love"" has the sort of sheer LYRICISM that one is so hard-pressed to find in mainstream movies today.
Allow me to gush about this film just a bit more. Certain sequences stand out. The editing of the film, back and forth, between rehearsals for ""Romeo and Juliet"" and Will & Viola's steamy bedroom scenes (Shakespearean prose included), is an example of the lyricism I mention. The actual performance of the play, especially the final scene, before an enraptured audience brought tears to my eyes. And exactly how Dame Judi Dench (As Elizabeth I) could cram so much power into so little screen time is a marvel unto itself.
If anything, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a bit of a fantasy. It requires a considerable suspension of disbelief in assuming that Viola might pass so easily as a young man, Sir Thomas Kent, or that Viola existed at all. Still, this film is just a WONDERFUL story that along the way touches on the issues of sex roles and gender identity. Will Shakespeare's own ambiguous sexuality is even hinted at, however briefly.

The legendary Shakespeare is drawn very well with some human flaws. It is interesting how this early in his career, some events from his later plays found their way into the movie. (Skull from 'Hamlet,' 5.1) (His sorrowful presence at the altar on his knees bears a similarity to Claudius' remorse in 'Hamlet' 3.3) Well that said, the story flows nicely. King Henry VIII's daughter Elizabeth is drawn quite well. (Especially the way her life enables her to feel an understanding for the object of Shakespeare's adoration.) Christopher Marlowe is well drawn as the already established writer who offers some assistance to Shakespeare's play still in the writing stage. (SIDE NOTE: Marlowe's ""Faustus,"" ""Edward II,"" and ""Massacre At Paris"" are some wonderful plays to read.) John Webster was probably not the monster he is portrayed as, but at least his nature kind of hints at the nature of the plays he would write. (His ""Duchess of Malfi"" and ""The White Devil"" are bloody, but good.) Ben Affleck is fine as the Laurence Olvier of their era. All in all, there is a nice representation of Elizabethan times, some interesting speculation of historical figures, and some well drawn fictional people.

1037616,3,6305470448,"It's an indication of just how low our expectations from film have become that a mildly pleasant diversion like SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE should be acclaimed as a major achievement. Presumably because it has actors who speak grammatical English as if they really are familiar with words longer than four letters, was directed by someone who knows where to put a camera, and has a script written by someone with a memory before, say, 1975, people feel obliged to hail it as a masterpiece. It isn't one, but at least you can watch it without feeling you have to get drunk afterwards.
SHAKESPEARE isn't a bad film. Aside from the sickly, syrupy music that suffocates like plastic wrap, it isn't cheap or shoddy. It's just that like most superficial works of art, it doesn't lend itself to repeated viewings. Watching a second time round, you might catch one or two inside references to Shakespeare's plays that you missed the first time. Once you've got all those, though, the conceit dries up pretty fast. If you've read or seen any of Stoppard's other work, you know that the script here isn't much more than a re-shuffle of a well-worn deck of cards. On the other hand, the script is the only thing that gives the film any distinction at all.
Let's not forget that this ""Hollywood"" film is in fact a BRITISH production, which is probably the most pathetic comment of all. Having beaten the seriousness out of native talent, the studios have to import it whenever they try to achieve a level of craftsmanship that they once would have taken as a given. In the thirties or forties, the studios could have made this in the blink of an eye. It would have cost fifty cents, would have featured bit players from the studio's stable of character actors, would have made the bottom half of a double-bill and would have been received exactly for what it was, a cinematic bon-bon. As long as you treat it in the same spirit, you won't be disappointed.

1037619,4,6305470448,"1998 was the rebirth of the renaissance, and that year's nominated films  proved that one didn't have to lug a Brittanica  from a dusty bookshelf to  enjoy a piece of history. ""Elizabeth"" and ""Shakespeare In  Love"" were in high competition with many nominations in the same  category, including Best Actress and Best Picture. Cate Blanchett was  enrapturing as England's prudent and perservering monarch, but audiences  were swept away  by the fictitious yet contemporary fable of how  ""Romeo and Juliet"" was birthed from one of the greatest literary  minds in the world. This beautiful piece of filmmaking is director John  Madden's delightful theory of how William Shakespeare, the celebrated but  mystifying playwright, conjured one of the greatest romantic tragedies ever  told in the history of theater. It is well cast as well as superbly  directed, the actors clad in elaborate and colorful ball gowns and  pantaloons correlating impeccably with the renaissance period. The sets are  scrupulously designed and the cinematography is stunning, capturing each  integral moment with precision and style. Born at a time when Hollywood was  swallowed by the over-hyped action genre, ""Shakespeare In Love""  was a refreshing and welcome change.
Gwyneth Paltrow is radiant as the  fair and virtuous Viola de Lesseps, a ray of sunshine and a wild spirit  underneath her frill and fuss. In her determination to be a recognized  thespian, she dons a bland and inconspicuous wig, giving herself the alias  of Thomas Kent and heads to an audition for Shakespeare's pirate comedy  ""Romeo and Ethel"". Not only is she sought after for her  mesmerizing presence on stage, she becomes the object of Will's affections,  revealing her true identity and becoming his lover and muse.
Joseph  Fiennes was an excellent choice for the pining dramatist, a beguiling and  head-turning gentleman with gumption to boot. He is exactly the opposite of  what we know from the enigmatic author, a more preferred and desirable  flesh-and-blood incarnation for the director's fictional premise and  dazzling vision. He plays the part of the melodramatic and self-deprecating  artist convincingly, feeding off his emotions for inspiration. His  imagination is aroused intensely when he lays eyes upon Viola for the first  time, and immediately afterward begins penning the poetic splendor that has  eluded him for months. Out of his intense love affair and the  heartwrenching despair of their uncontrollable fates comes his tragedy, one  that will win the queen's heart and secure him a place in her royal court  of artists and poets for life.
The supporting cast is incredibly gifted,  especially the droll quirkiness of Geoffrey Rush's depiction of Philip  Henslowe, a businessman with an inescapable debt and the lifesaving ability  to negotiate. Also to be commended for brilliant theatrics is Colin Firth  as the pompous and domineering Lord Wessex, Viola's betrothed and a  conniving gold digger to boot. The ire and jealousy between Firth and  Fiennes is electrifying and suspenseful,  their opposing methodology making  for the perfect chemistry. I also enjoyed seeing Rupert Everett as  Christopher Marlowe, the man who makes no effort for ideas - they flow to  him as if by a river. Judi Dench was perfectly snide and razor-sharp as  Queen Elizabeth, but I don't think she was deserving of an Oscar. She had  less screen time than the nurse (Imelda Staunton, who by the way, was the  best nurse I've ever seen). Perhaps the Academy was so enamored with her in  the past that there was no holding their breaths this time around.
Marc  Norman and Tom Stoppard are to be commended for their nimble intermingling  of famous Shakespearian lines and the overall admirable wit of their jovial  and lighthearted screenplay. Thumbs up also go to editing and directing,  both of which were consistently well balanced and effective. If you're  looking for an uplifting flick without the overbearing fluff of most  romantic comedies, then take a step in this direction. You'll be walking a  path of unexpected enlightenment.",968889600,9,4093,5.207692307692308

The setting is great and young Mr. Fiennes fit right in  even after  I had seen his brilliant role in ""Elizabeth"". Judi  Dench was a cinch to win the oscar. She is marvelous as always.

Unlike ""Titanic"",  ""Shakespeare"" does so self-consciously and to great comedic  effect (having the Bard himself seek treatment from a shrink for writers'  block was a delicious bit of satire).
The fact that Hollywood loves this  movie should not discourage the rest of us in flyover country. The script  is brilliantly funny, and every member of the cast plays his or her part to  a ""T"".

1037685,4,6305470448,"I am not an avid reader of Shakespeare's tales for fear of being bombarded  by verbose prose, but SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE directed by John Madden is simply  a lush tale of twisted love which is accessible and is bolstered by staunch  performance from Gwyneth Paltrow who deservingly won a Best Actress for her  role as Viola and the smouldering Joseph Fiennes as Will. It tells how Will  scripted Romeo and Juliet and the delighful comedy spirals in when Viola  dressed herself as a man for the role of Romeo. She yearns to break free of  the shackles from her loveless marriage with Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) and  march to the exuberance of the reel life by getting herself the part. There  lies the beautiful poetic imagery that heightens the intensity of their  passion - cutting and excruciating - even I am touched by the desperation,  the madness of their love. It is a comedy, but it does not extract itself  from the realities - the couple must face their separation with courage,  beliving love is not a transient thing but a commitment.
The great  supporting cast of Judi Dench, who holds up the majesty as the Queen,  Geoffrey Rush and Ben Affleck is suitably buoyant. The story offers a  tantalizing history of how his work came by and sometimes it is even hard  to distinguish between fiction and truth. Ultimately, the love story is one  of wits, of passion and love - and we herald willingly long live the Bard.

Shakespeare plays an  adulterer, who is estranged from his wife and children, who falls for the  lead female character. I am not fond of characters who have those low moral  standards.
 My husband took me to this movie, because he had heard it was  a good date flick, well, not really, unless you find men who are cheating  on thier wives romantic and attractive. So that did not make him a highly  desirable male character for me to enjoy the story.

1037729,4,6305470448,"Purists who turn up their noses at Shakespeare in Love are truly missing  something. This was, after all, written by Tom Stoppard, author of some of  the very best plays of modern times (Arcadia, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern  are Dead - the latter filmed with Gary Oldman and Tim Roth. Plus the  Gilliam movie Brazil). He's done a splendid job of balancing accessibility  with genuine wit. The screenplay is littered with allusions to the bard's  works, and gives some great - albeit hypothetical - insights into how and  why he wrote.
This would be a great teaser for high school students  studying Shakespeare. It makes him (and his works) seem fun, human, and  relevant to today. And there are great quiz opportunities in spotting the  many references to the plays: twelfth night (the sequel commissioned by the  queen); Hamlet (studying the skull); Macbeth and others (ghost scene); more  on Romeo (""a plague on both their houses"").
Beyond that, in  true Shakespearean style, we are offered the ""play within the  play"" - in this case Romeo and Juliet. Excellent editing gives us just  enough to convey the mood of an Elizabethan performance, leaving us wanting  more. This film does a great job of broadening the appeal of the most  popular writer.
And don't miss the topical in-jokes - the  ""cabby"" rowing the boat, and especially Glenda Jackson saying she  knows what it's like to do a man's job (she plays ""M"" in the Bond  movies). Bill S. would have approved. High praise indeed.",962928000,3,1487,4.848605577689243

I guess it has an appeal to masses, otherwise it's  hard to explain why it wins these rave reviewes.  All in all, it's a soap  opera at best, and even the sonnet they selected is the most beaten up  Shakespeare's piece.

Viola shows all of the modern attitudes that Rose did in  ""Titanic"" - horribly out of place, and downright depressing.  Shakespeare is portrayed little better.

Then, my now girlfriend dragged me to it (the first movie we saw  together).  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Unfolding before me was a funny,  touching (yeah, guys can like touching movies, too), well-acted,  well-writen, wonderfully entertaining movie.

I agree with the previous  reviewer who said Shakespeare purists should give this film a break.  This  is not Shakespeare.  It is fiction.  That said, if Shakespeare were to  magically come to life, I bet he would love this flick.  It has all the  elements he employed. Humor, romance, swashbuckling action and tragedy.

1037855,5,6305470448,"Be forewarned: this is not, nor was it ever intended to be a history lesson about the creation of what is surely the greatest literary tragedy of all time.  It was, however, intended to be a charming and ingenious  FICTIONAL look at the period and the people who inhabited it.  On that  level it succeeds beautifully.  Oh, for sure there are truths here, not the  least of which has to do with the fact that all the parts in theatres of  that time and place were played by men.  But even that is presented with a  keen sense of humor.  In fact, the story revolves, to a great degree,  around that element.  The character of Viola (charmingly portrayed by  Gwyneth Paltrow) loves the theatre so much she dresses as a man in order to  enable her to act.  This gender switching plot twist has been attempted  several times in films of the past.  TOOTSIE and YENTL are  excellent  examples of similar story lines.  But here you have the character falling  in love with a certain playwright named Will.  How that element is  integrated with Viola's gender switching is most ingenious.  NOT  historically correct but ingenious.
The script by Marc Norman (who also  served as one of the producers) and Tom Stoppard is really what makes this  film come alive.  Without their vision, it would have been just another  romantic comedy.  As it is, these writers have humanized a period so remote  from ours that you feel yourself transported back to that time.  They  certainly deserved their Oscar.
With all the controversy at the Academy  Awards that year SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE came out looking like a villian.  There is no doubt that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN should have won the Best Picture  Oscar.  If it were possible, this reviewer would give that film TEN stars  instead of the usual maximum of five.  It is that much better at what it  does than  SHAKESPEARE.... is at what it tries to accomplish!  But why  bother with technicalities.  The Academy has made mistakes similar to this  before.  Miramax, the company responsible for releasing the film bought the  votes from those that would have voted for ....RYAN.  For that, they were  wrong.  But isn't it wonderful that they had the gumption to grab this film  and distribute it so it could be seen by all of us.  It truly is a  blessing, even if it wasn't the best film of the year.
As far as the  other awards go, Paltrow definitely deserved the Oscar.  Her performance of  the very classy girl that falls in love with Shakespeare is  at once  realistic and romantic.  Without overacting, she convinces you she is the  girl who loves the theatre so much she would temporarily give up her own  identity to participate.  Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth shines briefly but  did not deserve the Supporting Actress Oscar.  The role is nothing more  than a glorified walk-on.  The supporting actress award should have gone to  Lynn Redgrave in GODS AND MONSTERS.  However, nearly all the other Oscars  the film won were deserved.  The costumes, sets, and music score by Stephen  Warbeck are excellent.  Occasionally, the sound department on the film  overpowers the dialogue with the beautiful music and this is a shame.  Otherwise the film is technically superb.
The rest of the cast, Geoffrey  Rush, Colin Firth, Ben Affleck and especially Joseph Fiennes as the love  sick Will S. are perfect.  John Madden directs with a keen eye for the  period and setting and along with the fantastic script should be given  credit for transporting the audience with a very smooth flight.
But the  real beauty of the film is it's ability to make the viewer see just how  down to earth and beautiful the works of Shakespeare really are.  Over the  years the intimidation of actors and directors alike has kept the Bard's  works from reaching a wider audience, both in film and on stage.  Thank  goodness, we finally have a film which, without changing the works  themselves, has made the playwright seem human and just as likely to flop  as any have since.  While it's not likely it really did happen this way,  isn't it a beautifully creative way of telling the story.  For that, the  film is worth seeing, buying and seeing again.

I will not really review this one as much as use it as an example that the academy awards  have sold out (they might have been before, but since I'm contemporary with  the later years I've come to notice now). Of the five movies nominated for  best picture this one deserved it the least, and I'm pretty sure that  saving Private Ryan was second in the ballots, which didn't deserve it  either. It seems that Hollywood thought that life is beautiful should've  been content with winning best foreign film and the thin red line was just  happy to be in such ""illustrious"" company and had no merits of  its own. Back to Shakespeare, it was a very flawed and disturbing film,  nothing like a real art house production, it was funny at times, tried to  be deep sometimes but never really accomplished anything. The acting was  nice, probably because it was full of many household names was a reason  hollywood liked it, ""hey they speak in english accents, it must be  sophisticated"", phonies. Well I think I'm reaching a 1000 words.  Shakespeare in love was a nice but very overrated film, trying to fulfil  the art film genre and at the same time aspiring to be main stream. It  didn't accomplish either, so it was stuck with an, I mean 5 or so Academy  Awards.

1037959,5,6305470448,"Because it happened to be released in the same year as Steven Spielberg's World War II behemoth SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE--which, against all odds, bested the war film for the 1998 Best Picture Oscar--has  been discarded by critics and audiences as unworthy of its award.  1980's  ORDINARY PEOPLE experienced a similar fate when it beat RAGING BULL, but  does this make ORDINARY PEOPLE any less of a fine film?  No.
And if  anything, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE's virtues are even more immediately apparent.  This is, from beginning to end, a masterpiece of romantic comedy that  takes an ingenious concept and transforms it into a hilarious parody, a  passionate love story, and ultimately a testament to the power of the  written word.
The screenplay by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, brimming  with wit and intricate Shakespearean allusions and in-jokes, is a marvel;  because the crackling dialogue flies so fast, the film rewards multiple  viewings by revealing more and more of itself each time.
The acting is  superb.  Joseph Fiennes, as young Will Shakespeare gives easily the most  underrated performance of the year.  Gwyneth Paltrow, juggling multiple  roles with subtle aplomb, more than deserved her Oscar (though Cate  Blanchett was equally brilliant in the title role of ELIZABETH).  The  standout among a strong supporting cast is Dame Judi Dench, whose short but  delicious turn as the mesmerizing Queen Elizabeth provides the film with  some of its juiciest moments.
I've been reading some of the reviews on  this board, and to be honest it's quite sad.  It's sad when reviewers can't  recognize a genuine work of cinematic art.  It's sad when reviewers can't  appreciate one of the smartest and most beautifully crafted entertainments  of the year.  It's sad when a bunch of bitter SAVING PRIVATE RYAN fans who  haven't even seen SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE decide to come and bash this mere  ""comedy,"" thinking that just because it doesn't have guns and  explosions and dead bodies it's not an ""Oscar film.""

Two examples of why this film is lousy.  First, the idea  that Gwyneth Paltrow's character's disguise as a man could convince anyone  not legally blind is absurd --since this is crucial to the plot, it's a  major problem.  (By the way, that's not a plot giveaway, since the viewer  always knows that it's Gwyneth behind the mustasche).  Second, the joke of  making the original title of Romeo and Juliet ""Romeo and Ethel the  Pirate's Daughter"" -- well, if you find that to be clever, I guess  you'll find the rest of the movie clever as well.
If you're really  interested in Shakespeare, see the recent versions of OTHELLO and RICHARD  III -- or better yet, Al Pacino's LOOKING FOR RICHARD.

I mean, I wasn't  exactly expecting Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet (Titanic, which is a  much better film due to those leading star's chemistry), but Paltrow looks  as if she's ready to avert her eyes away from Fiennes and blush every time  they kiss.  I wasn't convinced that her character Viola was actually in  love with Shakespeare.  Heck, these two make Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann  Moss look like Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh.  Despite the lack of  chemistry, both Fiennes and Paltrow deliver good performances (Fiennes  should have been nominated, Paltrow did well but shouldn't have won or been  nominated).  I will credit the Academy for awarding this film Best Original  Score in a Comedy because the soundtrack is absoulutely marvelous and is  second only to John William's Saving Private Ryan score.  But when the most  rousing aspect of a film is its musical score what exactly does that say  about the film itself?",947289600,3,1568,4.908045977011494

Seriously, though, I don't know why he  wasn't nominated for an Oscar. His performance as Shakespeare, the writer  who suffers in both love and writer's block, is one of the most romantic  and lovely performances I have seen in a while. His chemistry with co-star  Gwyneth Paltrow is red hot. You can just feel the way they yearn for each  other, but can never be truly together because she is promised to another.  Mix this situation in with Paltrow's desire to grace the stage (which was  illegal back then), and the hilarity that ensues as the company of men try  to rehearse for ""Romeo and Juliet,"" and you get one of the most  original films in years!  The only reason why I'm giving it four stars is  because it really wasn't completely about love. I mean, ""Shakespeare  in Lust"" or ""Shakespeare in Bed"" may have been better  titles.

Shakespeare in Love is a pretty good movie. The acting is good, everyone in it is quite impressive. The real gem here is the  screenplay, however. It is very clever and well-written. It manages to use  the language of the period (which I normally find sort of annoying and  stupid, sorry period lovers) and keeps it very watchable and funny. I liked  the dialogue a lot. The art direction, sets, costumes, etc. are also very  good.
The reason I give it a lower rating is because, considering all the  praise it received (not to mention a Best Picture award), I wasn't really  that impressed. I mean, it was a good movie, but . . . I don't know. Maybe  it's because I'm not a big fan of the genre (romantic comedy . . . is that  what it is? I'm not sure). This is a movie you should rent, and then buy if  you like it. It's a pretty good movie.",946944000,,934,4.167597765363128

In any case, the writing here is well done, not high art, but  it is consistently amusing, as is the entire production. Judy Dench gives  yet another irresistible performance. The photography is stunning, and is  captured well on the DVD. The extras on the DVD version are welcome  also.
Those that think it fodder for the nouveau literate missed the  point. It's not self- conscious attempt at high art. Indeed, pretentious is  what it is not. Great fun is what it is. Those that find the casting of  Gwynny in the role wrong, the accent lame, get a grip. Sure, we can imagine  some better choices, but she does rise to the occasion. Those who fancy  Kate Blanchett or Helena Bonham Carter would have faired better, keep in  mind what some studio wanker might have done...
That there are people  that would find this film lewd and offensive is a given is our society. If  this is offensive, your world must be narrow and mild indeed. England dealt  rather severely with the Puritans some years back, and blessed us with  their presence here, where they have bred with singular success. Perhaps  it's time to return the favor? Now there would be the makings of a good  story for a screenplay...
For those whose favorite film didn't win, my  condolences. As my favorites never win, you're in good company. Anyway,  what do you expect? This is a movie about Shakespeare, the theater, and a  society that attempted to persecute theater people. The academy is made up  of theater people. Or then again, Spielberg may have contrived to  heavy-handedly push all our emotional buttons one time to often...

He's lost his gift, resigned to sad despair. But then, as if on cue, a vision bright awakes again in him the will to write.  A vision full of poetry and love, as brilliant as the sun and stars above. Viola was her name, and she was fair, with eyes of blue, soft skin, and flaxen hair.  Their passion smoldered, nearly to a smother.  But fate's unkind -- she's promised to another! Yet, through despair, their love grew deeper still -- how sad for this Viola and this Will!  But in the time 'twixt love and love's sad end, she lit in him the fire to write again.

Having worked with a descendant of  the great Will Kempe, whose sense of humour quite matches his great, late  relative's, it was a joy to sit through the movie.

Also, the character Rosaline was  irritating and grotesque.  Sexuality in female characters has been polluted  enough with poor and ugly symbolism.  Why continue to keep it so  unnecessarily crude?

The dialogue in this film is nothing  short of spellbinding - I didn't move in my seat for the duration of the  movie and my eyes were locked to the screen.

Two months later, I was dying to go back to the theater and watch it again - why, it was a mystery.  So I paid a little more attention the 2nd time round, and I found out why subconsciously I'd already come to like that film after the first viewing.
To begin with, the dialogues are witty and very well-written.  As someone who had never read any Shakespeare before (pardon me, Shakespeare gurus), I didn't know at first that there're many, many lines that were taken directly from the poet/playwright. As I read 12 of Shakepeare's plays and all of his sonnets after the movie (you can tell that I fell madly in love with Shakespeare after watching the film), I came to see how Shakespeare's own words were taken out and seamed together so cleverly and perfectly in the script. And as I re-watch the video, each time I continue to discover something new in the script that I didn't notice before.
Second, the way the Romeo/Juliet and Will/Viola stories intertwines together is just fabulous and done perfectly.  The two stories bring each other to life and it's just a very creative and beautiful way of telling a story.  The lead to the Twelth Night at the end is totally icing on an already-marvelous cake.

I saw it three times at the movies and could have easily gone to see it again and again.  When  it won so many Academy Awards, I wasn't surprised except I thought Saving  Private Ryan should have won Best Picture.  I also felt that Tom Wilkinson  didn't get the praise he deserved.  His performance was, as usual for Tom,  understated and perfect.  I thought he should have been nominated instead  of Geoffrey Rush, for best supporting actor, and I'm an aussie.
I also  felt Joseph Fiennes should have got a Best Actor gong.  Gwyneth was great  but Joseph's performance of Will was exceptional to say the least.
The  highlights for me were the unfolding of the two stories, (Romeo and Juliet  & Will and Viola).  Then the actual performance of Romeo and Juliet and  the intertwining tragedy of Will and Viola.  The way the audience reacted  at the end said it all.
I think that 'Shakespeare In Love' is mainly a  movie that females thoroughly love.  The males in my circle of friends and  family didn't quite GET IT so to speak.

Sure it panders to people who would  like to look intelligent while they knowingly chuckle at the in-jokes.  This is Titanic for the I-graduated-from-college crowd.

I agree with the reviewer of 10 October 1999 that it is  boring.  Also, I agree that for period movies one is better served with  ""SENSE AND SENSIBILITIES""  and  ""PRIDE AND PREJUDICE"".  They have a very witty, engaging dialogue and a substantial story worthy to  spend the time.  For a more accessible Shakespeare movie I definitely  recommend ""MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING"", a really funny play and  skillfully adapted for the screen.

For a 20 century equivalent of  Shakespeare's films, I recommend ""MY FAIR LADY"", based on the  greatest BERNARD SHAW's ""PYGMALION"".  It is really, really funny,  timeless and original.  It is the most sophisticated romantic comedy ever  put into the siverscreen.",939686400,3,1303,4.726457399103139
1038319,5,6305470448,"I am amazed at the disparity of reviews from 1 - 5 stars.  This picture was great entertainment in the grand scale of Hollywood -- but should not be mistaken as an actual a history lesson.
Stoppard's script was witty,  funny and punny, filled with clever 'takes' on Shakespeare.  I might agree  with many that Paltrow gave a good not great performance but as with many  others before she benefited by the overall reaction to the film.  How one  can call this film boring is difficult to understand.  The sets, the  dialog, the cleverness of the plot, and the wonderful lighting, partularly  of Ms. Paltrow, who was radiant, made this a great film experience for  adults.
Saving Private Ryan was indeed a great film as well and in  another year perhaps... but after the first 30 minutes it struck me a a  'throwback' to the stereotypical war films we've seen before -- the wise  guy, the Brooklynite, the sensitive one, and the ever present coward.  Again Spielberg is a master of recycling a story and putting his special  talents to great use.
For my money Shakespeare in Love represents one of  the most enjoyable movie going experience in many years.",939340800,,1153,4.685
1038320,3,6305470448,"...c'mon.  I mean, ""Best Picture""?  I'm sorry, I just didn't see it.  This was very creative and at times very funny, but I don't think it deserved as much hype as it received.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and LIFE IS  BEAUTIFUL were both much better.  And Cate Blanchett was robbed of an Oscar  for her performance in ELIZABETH.  Gwyneth is good, but not that  good.
Don't get me wrong, I was pleased with this movie. It was enjoyable  and entertaing.  But when I think Best Picture, I think of something truly  spectacular that tells a great story.  This was't great.  It was just good.  (And I normally love anything that has nudity or deasl with Shakespere!)",938649600,,654,4.565217391304348
1038321,4,6305470448,"Just a fabliau. But in our times, we need sometimes to go beyond the reality, beyond the history. I liked the film. It's a film that aims at charming, not at convincing.",938304000,,169,4.3125
1038322,4,6305470448,"""Shakespeare in Love"" is the second of Tom Stoppard's Shakespearean whimsies to hit the screen, after ""Rosencranz and Gildenstern are Dead.""  Like ""R & G"", ""Shakespeare  in Love"" imagines circumstances that cannot really be inferred from  any history or text by Shakespeare himself--this time, the life of  Shakespeare rather than his minor characters.  While the older film was  essentially an elaborate stunt that was amusing and interesting to a  certain extent--essentially a stage play trapped on film--this one is  highly cinematic, full of eye-candy costumes and recreations of Elizebethan  England.  The story is resolutely unrealistic, but that's not the point,  anyway: The point is the passionate romance between Shakespeare and a  fictional heiress who dresses in drag to act in the premier production of  what will eventually be ""Romeo & Juliet.""  That romance is  very sexy--there may not be two more beautiful people on this planet than  Gweneth Paltrow and Joseph Finnes--and earnest, but the best parts of the  movie are firmly tongue-in-cheek: Shakespeare's distress at the death of  rival Christopher Marlowe, Ben Affleck's performance as a preening prima  donna actor (a sly satire of many of his arrogant peers), and best of all,  Geoffrey Rush's hysterical performance as a conniving theatre owner whose  sole asset is a playwright (Shakespeare) whose name sells tickets like few  others.  The leads could be better--Paltrow is steady and sexy as  Shakespeare's love but there is nothing remarkable about her performance,  and Finnes is beautiful but unconvincing as the hard-drinking, hard-loving  genius Shakespeare--but they're adequate for this stylistic comedy.",937872000,,1688,5.52156862745098
1038363,5,6305470448,"Impressive acting by Paltrow and ""the guy who played Shakespeare"" unfortunatly I do not know his name.  I just watched this movie over the weekend and I must say I loved it!  I can clearly see why it  got the awards it recieved.  The set and costumes were magnificent, had a  wonderful plot and I love the ending ""Romeo and Juliet"" scene. I  got a real feel of the shakespearean theater during this film.  GREAT  GREAT GREAT.  This film made me smile.  :)",936662400,,455,4.373493975903615
1038364,5,6305470448,"Truth be told, Shakespeare in Love is not nearly as substantial as its rich style would have you believe.  The romance between Will and Viola doesn't seem to be much about romance; they aren't soulmates, but they're  great bedmates.  You'd think our beloved William Shakespeare would be less  shallow!

 On the other hand, Romeo and Juliet itself is a story more  about passion and lust than true, romantic love.  This parallel fuels the  moods and unpredictability of the entire film, as it does the brilliant  play-within-a-play structure.

 And like a good Elizabethan era play,  you got all mixes of low-brow and high-brow for all audiences.  Great  costumes, witty dialogue, great plot twists, fight scenes, some brooding  drama, reverence for the Queen, reverence for the common man, and biting  irreverence for everybody else.  And plenty comedy.  Verbal comedy.  Physical comedy.  Situational comedy.

 Add up all these things and  it's very hard not to swoon.  The winner here is the screenwriters who have  succeeded in playing homage to the Elizabethan literature while playing it  (and our time) for laughs by making a play that might have belonged in it.  Couple it with a classic Hollywood production (itself a continuation of  that era's penchant for maximal thrills), and you have Shakespeare In Love,  the best romantic comedy I've ever seen.",936489600,2,1359,5.129032258064516

Wonderfully paced humor,  romance, sadness and wit.  If you enjoy the thinking man's romance/comedy,  this one is for you!

I was not  familiar with Fiennes work but he won my respect with this film. He is all  I picture Shakespeare to be. I have even gotten my seven year old in love  with the movie.

The fact that Joseph Fiennes was not even  nominated alongside his mesmerizing co-star is beyond me, but Gwyneth  Paltrow did bring glorius life to the incredibly dismal scenery she walked  through.

1038485,5,6305470448,"If you want to know what I think of the film, I believe it was one of the best films of 1998. I won't go any further. Instead, I'll concentrate on the qualities of the disc itself, since that's undoubtedly what you've  scrolled down the screen to read in the first place, rather than people's  pitious cries of miscomprehension.
The disc is wonderful. The quality of  the transfer is near reference. This is Disney's first ever 16x9 transfer,  and the down-conversion for my 4x3 screen was luminous. Not a distortion or  artifact to be found. The audio is also fine, though the film's nature  obviously precludes any public display for the sake of a few  ""Ahhs"" and ""Oohs"". Stick to Armageddon for that.
Now  the downside. Aside from the trailer and a few historical notes, the disc  has litte to offer in the supplemental department. Which is even more  aggravating since the rest of the world is receiving a special edition disc  with director's commentary and deleted scenes.
The special edition will  be hitting region 1 sometime next year (that way Disney can milk you for  the same money twice). Those of you who love the movie and want to own it  immediately will be pleased with this disc. Those of you on the borderline,  however, may wish to wait for next year's special edition.",934329600,,1289,4.666666666666667

The  characters are well deveolped and finely tuned as an ensamble cast, as is  the case with Stoppard's R&G.

Trust me, if you  want a movie that truly shows the Elizabethan era and is worthy of all the  Oscars it was robbed of, try Elizabeth.

It has wonderful acting, beautiful scenery and  costumes, and a very interesting story.  This is not my favorite movie at  all but it is up there.  People kept on saying that Kate Blanchet should  have gotten best actress, but personally I think she did not have nearly as  good of a performance.  In fact, I think Elizabeth was quite a sleeper.
