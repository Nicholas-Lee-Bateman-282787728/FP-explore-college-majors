3515707,5,B001CQONM2,"Most of all, I love & respect his honesty. Calling him a ""racist"" means you've completely missed the point. He is an ""equal opportunity offender"". He makes the MOST fun of his OWN race.",1327536000,,185,4.470588235294118

3515709,5,B001CQONM2,"I bought this after watching ""No Strings Attached"" & all four seasons of Mind of Mencia on DVD.  I had to back the DVD up a few times because it was so funny I missed a joke because I was still laughing.  ALWAYS watch any ""special features"" offered on his DVDs!",1287446400,,261,4.098039215686274
3515710,5,B001CQONM2,"Carlos Mencia has a specific sense of humor. He will tell you how ""it is"" without todays wide spread and so called political correctness. You will either love it or hate it. I do find this performance very entertaining and funny to the bone. This is not a very subtile racial and gender oriented humor, but that is what Carlos is all about. Highly recommended for the right audience.",1279670400,,383,4.565217391304348
3515711,2,B001CQONM2,After seeing his stuff on YouTube I figured this new disk would have me in stitches. I fell asleep about half way through it. He is funny as first but then he falls into this racial and political rant that was just not that funny.,1232841600,,230,4.133333333333334

8288675,5,B001CQONM2,"One of my favorite comedians. I love him because he makes fun of everyone. I hate ignorant racist people, there is too much of that crap in the world but I think anyone would like Carlos because he leave no group unpickedon. He picks on all people for all the things we might all think and isn't offensive about it.",1398124800,,315,4.266666666666667
8288676,5,B001CQONM2,"In the tradition of Carlos Mencia, he pushes the comedy envelope to its extreme...no subject is taboo.  In a class with Dave Chappell, they are the new Kings of Modern Day Comedy!",1386633600,,179,4.59375
8288677,4,B001CQONM2,The DVD arrived promptly and in great shape. The show was quite entertaining and a great laugh. I remember the day when we could at everything-- he does this very well and it's refreshing.,1379635200,,188,4.5588235294117645
8288678,5,B001CQONM2,"Carlos Mencia is one of the funniest performers I've ever seen.  I know he can be shocking at times, but my son and I think he is hilarious!",1368057600,,140,4.0
8288679,4,B001CQONM2,"I guess it is a hangover from my own mother, but I tend to prefer comics that do not use a great deal of profanity in their shows. That preference goes out the window where Ned ""Carlos"" Mencia is concerned.  Carlos is a foul mouthed, equal opportunity racist. He has an opinion on everyone - and his expletive filled rants are the stuff of legend. Potty mouth aside - Carlos is not afraid to say what the rest of us are thinking.  I still wince every time a comic uses awful language. It does not stop me from putting Carlos on if I need to laugh at someone that truly says what they are thinking........",1354665600,,604,4.243478260869566
