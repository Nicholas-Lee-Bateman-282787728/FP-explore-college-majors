8442058,5,B004UR1RAQ,"Fantastic.  Sinatra's version of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" from the concert in Japan on this DVD is definitive and the absolute best ever.  These two concerts are pure Sinatra.  Nothing else compares. I cannot more highly recommend this!",1518480000,,232,4.897435897435898
8442059,5,B004UR1RAQ,"The Festival Hall concert was great. I was in London when this concert took place but couldn't afford the concert. The evening standard ran a story on him with a picture that showed his address on the building. I wrote to him there and he sent me an autographed photo. A memorable moment. As for the DVD listen to his rendition of ' I get along without you very well ' , it is exquisite even though he fluffs a line. Brilliant concert with Sinatra in great form and great voice.",1509321600,2,478,4.263736263736264

8442063,5,B004UR1RAQ,"In 1988 Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman organized a benefit concert at London's Royal Albert Hall to not only benefit The Great Ormond Street Hospital in London but to give exposure to local bands in 10 towns in England. Five of the top bands played the concert followed by a lot of Wyman's well-known friends who performed in some -often unusual combinations. The concert was filmed by Wyman forgot he had the tapes until 2006 when the concert was released in the UK on DVD from Classic Studio. This DVD is the one released and distributed by MVDvisual in the US in 2011. It's a real gem for music fans - especially those with wide range of pop and rock interest.

There are two parts to the program. The one most will be interested in is the Superstar section which runs about 75 minutes. It starts off with Elvis Costello and the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde performing duet versions (with just two acoustic guitars) of Lennon-McCartney's ""There's A Place"", The Kinks' ""days"" and - a real oddball, that works - the Bachrach/David song (recorded by Dionne Warwick) ""Windows of the World"". Next up is Chris Rea on both guitars and keyboards for three numbers. Then comes what is billed as The All-Star Band. It certainly is! In addition to Wyman on bass, there is fellow Stone Ronnie Wood, Eddy Grant, Ian Drury and Phil Collins (with a nearly full head of hair - remember this is 1988) as one of the two drummers. The band works it's way through standards like ""Johnnie B. Goode"", and the Freddy Cannon classic ""Tallahassee Lassie"" (with Drury on lead vocals) before winding it up with Wood and Terrence Trent D'arby leading everyone in the stones classics ""It's All Over Now"" and, finally, ""Honky Tonk Women"". The camera work is great and sound real fine.

As a ""Special Feature"" we are presented with 45 minutes of footage - introduced by Wyman of the five bands who won the competition - none who ever made it big in the US.

Had Wyman not found the tapes of this concert, this ""One Time Only"" event would not have been available. I had a great time watching it and I'm so glad Wyman did find it!
