8719257,3,B00YUB9TN4,"2015NR: This could've been a much better film with more of Neve Campbell. I mean Nyman is definitely a good actor, but the film was just slow.

Can't really say more without giving away the twist, so ... Enjoy 3x MFJLabs",1441756800,,220,4.365853658536586
8719258,4,B00YUB9TN4,"Oh that was tough to watch, only because it was so well done, and I related to it too well. I would've given 5 stars but it was so freaking depressing and left my stomach in such a knot that it ticked me off for making me feel that much. This is the story of an everyman with a seemingly perfectly organized life, who makes what becomes a dark attempt to save a spiraling out of control sense of normalcy. Although one could say that Martin (Andy Nyman) really didn't have such a rough go of it, even when things got bad, and that he didn't need to go to such extremes. But that is the unexpected gut punch of it. The viewer realizes the fragile tightrope many walk between success and failure, and how the less intrepid among us might not handle things so heroically and stoically when faced with such a drastic change in life. No chase scenes, no aliens, no explosions, just a depiction of the worst kind of terror, what we are all capable of doing when pushed to our breaking point.  The Glass Man imploded under pressure and the shards were painfully familiar.",1441497600,,1064,4.373737373737374
