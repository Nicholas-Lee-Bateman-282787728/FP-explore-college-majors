8141661,1,B000HWYHGO,"I found this DVD less than satisfactory. It was orininally produced around 1984. There are 4 lectures on the DVD and no way, except by fast forwarding, to get to each lecture. The book, Celebration of Discipline, has 12 chapters on 12 different disciplines. I tried to use this DVD to accompany a  Bible Study from the book that I led. I love the book, but found the DVD too much trouble to use and not specific enough on most of the disciplines.",1180483200,12,446,4.373493975903615
