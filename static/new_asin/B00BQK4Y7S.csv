5666699,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"Very funny show! Just started the other day. Caught a newer episode on FX, instantly got hooked! Great show for stoners!",1372636800,,120,4.761904761904762
5666700,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"Hooray, now the original Aussie production's available in NTSC format! This is MUCH ruder and cruder than the Yank version, but I also think it's much funnier. Absolutely fabulous for those with a twisted sense of humour!",1372550400,10,221,5.0
5666701,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"Much better, and much much darker than the US version.

This AU version also has other dogs and cats that talk to each other.",1465430400,,125,4.208333333333333
5666702,3,B00BQK4Y7S,"The concept is great, but I could not relate to the two human characters. He was a pushover and she struck me as a bit of a slut. This was more about a dog who did not like his girl's new boyfriend and did everything possible to break them up. It had a few funny moments, but in the entire series I actually laughed out loud three or four times, most of the time I sat through each episode wondering why they were still together.

Kat and the Swedish dog were hot.",1455580800,,464,4.043478260869565
5666703,4,B00BQK4Y7S,"The DVD case came half destroyed and the third disk will not play the last episode. was this supposed to be new or previously used as a whiffle ball?

I did enjoy what I have been allowed to watch so far, though I am currently unable to view the last episode of disc three.",1455235200,,273,4.055555555555555
5666704,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"What can one say about Wilfred?  Very, very funny for those of us with weird senses of humor and not squeamish about comedy that's in very bad taste.",1454112000,,149,4.321428571428571
5666705,4,B00BQK4Y7S,English version is better,1452470400,,25,5.5
5666706,5,B00BQK4Y7S,This show is awesome! It came on time and don't forget that this is the Australian version so don't get confused.,1452211200,,113,4.428571428571429
5666707,4,B00BQK4Y7S,"The clips that held in the DVDs were broken, so the discs were free to rattle around. There are mentions of this from other reviewers, so you might as well buy a 4 disc case while you're at it.",1452038400,,193,3.9743589743589745
5666708,5,B00BQK4Y7S,I cannot express just how much I enjoy the original Australian version of this series.,1450483200,,86,4.8
5666709,1,B00BQK4Y7S,"I thought I was getting the whole series (American) but in reality I got the Australian version which is not easily understood by regular speaking English, especially as spoken by a Texan.",1447632000,,188,4.90625
5666710,2,B00BQK4Y7S,Not the American version,1429142400,,24,5.25
5666711,5,B00BQK4Y7S,So much better than watching Elijah wood cry his way through every episode,1428796800,,74,4.769230769230769
5666712,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"Great cast and mostly funny episodes, the camera work is terrible. The D.P. was a terrible choice. But all together. A great price and worth the shipping. I'd suggest you buy it if you loved the FX series with the same name. Australian humor is very much as dry and witty as British comedies. But it has several gut splitting moments, and countless hours if entertainment.",1424822400,,372,4.651515151515151
5666713,2,B00BQK4Y7S,like the old saying goes. Buy American if you don't want something that sucks. It would be one star but this inspired the good version of  Wilfred so it gets an extra point.,1424476800,,173,4.242424242424242
5666714,3,B00BQK4Y7S,Not as good as the American version according to my Nephew. He would still give it a mild thumbs up and worth watching.,1421020800,,119,4.217391304347826
5666715,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"If you like the US version of Wilfred, this one is a must. Shame it only spans two seasons.",1419292800,,91,3.8421052631578947
5666716,5,B00BQK4Y7S,This version is better than the American version but Jason Gann is Wilfred in both versions so watching both are worthwhile.,1417996800,,124,4.9523809523809526
5666717,5,B00BQK4Y7S,Awesome!!,1414627200,,9,9.0
5666718,2,B00BQK4Y7S,"What a huge disappointed this DVD was. Sadly, I am beginning to distrust Amazon recommendations. First, I opened the DVD case. 4 DVDs are packaged in one case, 2 on a middle insert. The DVDs on the middle insert just fell out of the case as the little plastic clips designed to held the DVDs securely were broken. Junk design. The DVDs are very difficult to understand unless you perhaps are Australian. There are no subtitles so the dialogue is difficult to understand. The video quality isn't all that great either. The plot? Just not that funny overall. I regret buying it. I won't watch it again. I won't recommend it to anyone.",1412294400,,632,4.601769911504425
5666719,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"A very funny series.  The storyline is bizarre, yet it works very well.  The writing is clever, and Jason Gann is the personification of Wilfred.",1402790400,2,145,4.76
5666720,1,B00BQK4Y7S,"heavily accented ""loser"" or ""psycho""  australian slang.  supposedly in the first episode is the ""revelation"" as to the humorous set up for the entire series.  i watched it twice and identified two scenes where i guess they are ""setting up the whole premise"" but alas its in some slang that i can't even guess what it is or refers to.
besides that, the female comedy character acts ""crazy"" but not funny crazy just crazy.
does that concept have legs?  alcoholic guy,alcoholic dog and crazy chick?
one star till the subtitles and australian alcoholic slang dictionary are included as extras.",1400976000,7,589,4.91919191919192
5666721,4,B00BQK4Y7S,"If you have the ability to embrace the unlikely spectacle of a dog played by a man in a dog suit, you'll enjoy this weird, wacky, hilarious show.",1400630400,3,145,4.214285714285714
5666722,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"We bought this two-season set of the Australian original Wilfred, based on enjoying the later U.S. version.  I have to say the Aussie show is better in every way:  More complex characters, better stories, uninhibited comedy, rough language, etc.  Wilfred encounters a lot of other animals in this series, usually human actors dressed in suits as dogs, possums, cats, birds.

It's a very black comedy, and the American version is quite watered-down by comparison.  If you liked the U.S. show, you probably will love this more.",1399507200,15,525,5.058139534883721
5666723,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"Coarse, distasteful, crude - love it!
These original Aussie series far outshine the American version, although not for everyone, it truly is unique.",1395705600,3,148,5.478260869565218
5666724,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"While I still prefer the american version, I really wanted to check the original series out. Great quality, exactly what I expected.",1393977600,2,132,5.045454545454546
5666725,1,B00BQK4Y7S,it was nothing like the tv show and I was very disappointed I would have returned it but had opened it and was not sure if they would take it back,1388448000,,146,3.7419354838709675
5666726,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"LOVED IT. I did. It's not as psychological as the US version which I love too, but still very funny & well written.",1380672000,,115,4.043478260869565
5666727,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"If you are a Wilfred fan, then the original series from Australia is something you should get. It is different ; there are more characters like Wilfred in this ""world"". Wilfred has interactions away from Adam ( the counterpart to Ryan).",1378944000,11,236,4.780487804878049
5666728,5,B00BQK4Y7S,I saw a couple of these on IFC and always wanted to see all the episodes. I was not disappointed. The original Australian Wilfred was excellent series and establishes a baseline that the US series for quality. I found myself wanting more.,1373500800,11,238,4.690476190476191
5666729,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"It's so refreshing to see a comedy that is uninhibited, intelligent and so much fun.  This is so much better than your run of the mill sit-com. A real treat. It is definately not for kids though.",1373241600,11,195,4.27027027027027
5666730,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"Though both the Australian original and American FX remake share the same title and character they are vastly different. Where America needs a heap of filler characters, exposition and tamer jokes the original shines in brevity with straightforward, dry humor. It's a must watch for any fan of the remake, yet stands far enough apart from it that anyone with a darker sense of humor can enjoy it even more.",1372723200,16,406,4.814285714285714
8572680,1,B00BQK4Y7S,"I actually bought this thinking it wa sthe US version. My fault for not reading closer. I couldn't even make it through the first episode. The production value is cheap, the acting subpar, and the humor lacking.",1530835200,,211,4.72972972972973
8572681,2,B00BQK4Y7S,"This review concerns only the packaging. Within the case, all plastic nodes had broken off the center rings, leaving the discs loose in the case.  This resulted in scratches to the data side of discs.",1527811200,,200,4.714285714285714
8572682,3,B00BQK4Y7S,Package came on time however when I opened the dvd all the discs fell out and the leaflet part of the dvd was broken. Wish it had arrived in better condition. Other than that I love this show and you should too.,1527206400,,211,4.0476190476190474
8572683,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"First let me say that I won't let the fact that the retaining pins for disks 2, 3, and 4 were all completely broken off and those 3 DVDs were just loose inside the case, sliding and rattling about when the package arrived on my doorstep in anyway affect the five-star rating this, the ORIGINAL ""Wilfred"" series, absolutely deserves!

But I will say if you can get this amazing - & far darker comedy from Oz than the American version was ever allowed to be - from any OTHER VENDOR THAN THIS ONE, do it without hesitation! Otherwise, based on the condition mine arrived in, you really might be better off waiting until you can find it somewhere more reputable! I'm about to put disk 2 in & I'm really worried that all the abuse it & the final 2 disks went through throughout their shipping voyage may very well have left some if not all of the 3 DVDs unreadable!

But I was lucky enough to see the entire run of this with my Aussie girlfriend eons ago & it blew me away! Granted if you're uptight able every comedic subject under the sun & going into this Ozzian Classic ready to beat it to hell & back for every single shockingly unfiltered word & action out of a dog-man's mouth, then please keep your stick firmly rooted far up your kiester & just give this one a pass, Mate! And maybe give Jim Jeffries as well as every comedy club in the world where they tell the exact same jokes as in America, only with a ""funny"" accent, a skip-over as well!

But if you like stand-up no matter how dark or shocking it may occasionally get or in how ""silly"" of an accent it's delivered, find yourself a copy of this, settle in with your girl & your best furry mate, & be prepared to never think of your ""pet"" the same way again! Good on ya & G'day!",1519689600,,1737,4.225903614457831
8572684,5,B00BQK4Y7S,Great deal for the complete season and it's a hilarious show. Happy with my order!,1515110400,,82,4.533333333333333
8572685,4,B00BQK4Y7S,Great show,1495324800,,10,4.5
8572686,5,B00BQK4Y7S,great,1483574400,,5,5.0
8572687,5,B00BQK4Y7S,"a couple clips holding the discs in place must have snapped off during shipping, not ideal, but not a problem. No scratches, stores just fine. Great show, great product, might be worth the couple bucks to do a preferred shipping, but overall, would absolutely recommend this product.",1483488000,,283,5.042553191489362
8572688,5,B00BQK4Y7S,It's definitely different then the American version but I'd liked it. Thank you again,1472169600,,85,5.142857142857143
8572689,1,B00BQK4Y7S,It's the AUSTRALIAN version not US,1469577600,,34,4.833333333333333
