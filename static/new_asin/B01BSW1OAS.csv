7666818,1,B01BSW1OAS,"I watch a lot of bad movies because I like the suffering, and I thought I've seen some bad fish movies. While those had bad plots, horrible animation, or whatever, this film on the other hand, is BARELY animated, has NO CHARACTER OR PLOT, and is so badly animated a first year student using maya could have produced better. The so called ""education"" in this is flawed, its better to just watch a nature documentary. ESPECIALLY when the facts are actually WRONG, such as the part then they talk about giant squid and the footage shows cuttlefish. And yes, I did say FOOTAGE. The worst part of this movie is more than 50% of it is actually real life footage and not animation. They simply wrote dialogue around the fish footage they got, and horribly connected it all together that there are so many continuity errors I grew tired of counting them all. There was absolutely NO effort put into this film, and to call it a ""film"" is definitely giving it too much credit. Some people rate this movie higher, as it could be something brainless for kids to watch. But no, this movie probably makes children DUMBER, and should be never shown to children with developing minds. Please don't show this to any children, they deserve so much better. This was barely a movie, and honestly deserves less than 1 star since it barely even qualifies as one.",1472169600,3,1340,4.5875

8751280,1,B01BSW1OAS,"Wow, not only was it very poorly written, it was full of ""facts"" that were completely incorrect. Just start with the Eagle Ray that calls himself a manta ray. This thing looks like a student project out of the art institute laid over a bunch of aquarium videos. Horrible. Even for a 3 year old.",1506729600,,294,4.363636363636363

8751284,1,B01BSW1OAS,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is an attempt to take a national geo or discovery show and add some terrible cgi fish. I only wanted it to see the ocean footage as we like marine fish. If you watch this movie I suggest watching it while on mute.,1481068800,,266,3.8545454545454545

Graphics were outstanding, real live fish and places were used as well as some anamation.  Thumbs up on this one !!!",1472947200,,267,4.408163265306122
