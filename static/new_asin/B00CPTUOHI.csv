8584777,4,B00CPTUOHI,"I REMEMBER THE EPISODE TITLE ""THE GREAT PARENTS MYSTERY"" WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THEIR PARENTS. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE CAT AND DOG ARE MARRIED AND THEY HAD THEM ARE CONJOINED TWINS. BUT IT WASN'T, THEIR PARENTS IS THE BIGFOOT AND THE FROG WHO FOUND THEM AND RAISE THEM AS OF THEIR OWN. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF FREAKS THEY ARE. THEY STILL LOVE THEM.",1387497600,,356,4.3283582089552235
8584778,3,B00CPTUOHI,"Even though this is the final season of CatDog, I'd actually never seen it before viewing this DVD. I could tell pretty early on it was going to be too old for my four and five year olds but let them watch to give it a shot.

My animal loving daughter stayed and watched it with me but my son lost interest pretty quickly. The comic strip looking cartoon images aren't what they are used to. The strange creature that is half cat, half dog was enough to keep Paige watching! I personally found this creature a bit disturbing but hey, I'll give anything a shot!

I liked CatDog's adventurous spirit and determination in finding their parents. They run into all kinds of things along the way that keep it funny and interesting. Paige was actually laughing out loud at a lot of their antics while I didn't find their humor quite as amusing. It's definitely not a show for everyone since it's not your typical cartoon but Paige is now a fan and asks to watch ""that weird CatDog show.""

CatDog the final season was definitely a detour from the typical and entertaining with it's quirky characters, silly songs and crazy adventures.",1377043200,,1126,4.536945812807882
8584779,5,B00CPTUOHI,"I have been a fan of Cat Dog for some time and have been waiting for this last DVD to come out so that I could complete my collection. This DVD is a great final compilation of the last 8 episodes from the series.  I always found this series to be funny and the end of the series was just as funny as the rest. You get to see Cat Dog in some great situations and laugh along with the zany plot/adventures that they go through. This was bittersweet for me as it was the final season, but it was worth waiting for and now I can say that I now have whole series you can too! If you have been a fan for a while or are just starting to hear about this great series form the past, jump on board and see what Cat Dog is all about, you will love it!

8584780,5,B00CPTUOHI,"I don't think anybody that's a fan of this show will be disapointed with this set. My CatDog collection will soon be complete! Thank you, Shout! Factory, for releasing all of the seasons! A lot of companies don't release all seasons of a show if sales aren't spectacular, but even though sales for this show apparently weren't great [I've heard that The Wild Thornberrys dvds after season 2 part 2 were only available on Shout! Factory's website because sales were just okay and it must've been the same with CatDog cause season 3 was also only available on their website] they still kept releasing the show. Although, this set is available for pre-order off of other websites, so sales for season 3 must have been good enough to warrant that.",1375142400,,743,4.723076923076923
