8255246,5,B0014D4SB4,"I started tying flies in Dunsmuir, CA when I was 12 years old.  Local fly fisherman Ted Fay got me started and also showed me his fly fishing techniques when I used to join up with him on the Upper Sacramento River.  (This was long before he became really famous).  Well, I hadn't tied for many years and needed some refreshing.  The ""Hollywood Casting Couch"" DVD got me up and going again accompanied by some great humor not found in other instructional books and DVD's.  Complete and concise, I was tying my dry and wet fly patterns including the demonstrated Brown Hackle Peacocks and Hare's Ear Nymphs along with and my own old favorite patterns including wet/dry Grey Hackle Yellow, Zug Bug, Tellico and Montana Nymphs that are great for Sacramento River and creeks (and I can now find humor in my own rather frequent fly tying misadventures).  Outstanding narration and camera work make this DVD set a must for all fly tyers.  If you only buy one fly tying instructional DVD, this is the one!",1220572800,3,998,4.636363636363637
8255247,5,B0014D4SB4,"This DVD covers everything right from square one clear thru to some classic patterns for every situation.
  I really think these guys should have their own TV show!! They are very entertaining.
  The DVD leads you from painlessly from the first wrap of thread, one simple step at a time and each pattern builds on what you learned from the last one, laughing the whole way.",1203897600,2,373,4.606060606060606
8255248,5,B0014D4SB4,"If you are serious about learning to tie flies, this is the best DVD out there for beginners. The photography is outstanding and it gets you right inside, very close to the fly from the tyer's point of view.  As far as I've seen, this POV perspective is unique in fly tying DVDs.  The instruction is clear and precise and so well done that you can be a complete novice and truly learn to tie from this DVD. What's more, this is a two DVD set packed with information and fun entertainment too. It is a real bargain for the price.",1203897600,2,528,4.217821782178218
