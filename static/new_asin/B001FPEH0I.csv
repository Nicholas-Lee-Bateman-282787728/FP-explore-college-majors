3588087,2,B001FPEH0I,I purchased this DVD as a gift for my dad for Christmas.  He grew up watching Amos and Andy and was thrilled to receive it as a gift.  I was less thrilled as we watched it together.  Much of the DVD skips and it it seems to be a copied version of the shows.  I was very disappointed.  The DVD cost $14.95 and was supposed to be new.  Along with packing and shipping it cost about $20.  I was dissatisfied with this purchase and feel the seller needs to be more honest about the quality of the dvd.,1356912000,13,497,4.010204081632653
