7906932,5,B00000F4DJ,"How many of us have experienced a sports unjury and not known what to do with it? Should we treat it ourselves? Should we use heat or ice? The more active we are, the more we have to deal with sports-related injuries and it's frustrating not to always know how to respond.
While there is no substitute for good professuional medical care, there are many injuries we can take steps to minimize.
SPORTSAID covers the most common sports injuries.  It explains how to reconize these injuries, how to treat them ourselves and how to reduce the risk of them happening.
Knowing what to do in the first few minutes following an injury can often mean the difference between a manageable problem that soon allows you to get back to your favorite activity and a serious injury that keeps you inactive for a long time. Knowing how to reduce the risk of injuries in the first place can make your sports activities more enjoyable.
From the devoted runner to the weekend tennis player, from the aerobic dancer to the occasional walker, SPORTSAID is for all people.
