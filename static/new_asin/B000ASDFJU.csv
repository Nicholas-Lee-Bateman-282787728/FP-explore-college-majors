2391963,4,B000ASDFJU,"Yeah, Sarah exec.prod's, but this is a show that couldn't survive without the other 3 gals. YET, it is SARAH'S face and figure HOGGING the label side of ALL OF THE DVDS. Can you believe that? Sarah is such a prima donna, she won't let ANY of the other cast members have their face on even ONE dvd!! Yeah, like you're hurting for the cash and exposure right, honey? Not only THAT, but Sarah's character is the WHINIEST and the WEAKEST of the four. And unlike Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha she is the only cast member who did NOT do a nude scene. Otherwise, this is a GREAT collection. I LOVE nearly EVERY episode. What's sad is that none of the girls could be bothered to record a commentary track, so that's a slap in the face to SATC fans. The few commentaries that are included are pretty good. Oh, and be careful handling the cases the discs are housed in - one of mine is starting to come loose. One of the greatest shows ever!!!

After having seen the bonus material for season 6.5, I would love to DOCK this set one star for FALSE ADVERTISING. The pitch that there are 3 ""alternate endings"" is BOGUS. SATC fans, were we not lead to believe that there were different bona fide endings filmed for the final episode? Instead, what is seen is merely a few changes to the same scene in the coffee shop. SHAME ON WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DECEPTION!!!",1100131200,14,1360,4.396825396825397

2391967,2,B000ASDFJU,I love the Sex and the City series and was excited to get the collection.

The only think i would change is the cardboard sleeves that contain the dvds...i feel like sometimes they scratch the discs, and they definately aren't made to last. One of the cardboard sleeves in mine is torn, granted, i bought a used set but i could see them wearing down even more with use. Overall, i absolutely love it!",1498953600,2,483,4.377777777777778

2392007,2,B000ASDFJU,"The box itself is quite luxurious, but my biggest complaint is that the DVDs do not have an option to play all episodes. This makes it a pain to binge-watch each DVD in one go. There also seems to be quality issues with the disks themselves, as some of them start to pixellate slightly, though they manage to continue playing. I would assume this is a manufacturing issue as all of the disks in my set are in perfect condition with no scratches.

All in all I would not recommend this version. The Sex and the City: The Complete Collection (with the white box) is a much better choice at it has a Play All Episodes option.",1449446400,,622,4.316239316239316

2392037,4,B000ASDFJU,"Love, love, love this series!  The only reason I did not offer 5 stars is the way this is made and how the DVDs fit into the set - you have to be so very careful so as not to damage them each time you take one out or put one back in.

2392049,1,B000ASDFJU,"DO NOT BUY THIS SET. I was eventually reeled into purchasing this box set (as opposed to one of the newer releases) because of a drastic price drop around Cyber Monday. The first four discs (season 1 and the first twelve episodes of season 2) had some minor skips. That was annoying enough, but at episode 15 of season two on the fifth disc, the disc skips severely and becomes completely unplayable despite no visible scratches. I have tried it in multiple devices to be sure. Yes, I got this set for way less than retail, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to watch the series in its entirety. I have yet to watch any further, but I imagine there are issues elsewhere, too. Really frustrating.",1417996800,3,702,4.4921875

2392072,1,B000ASDFJU,the product when received was a boot leg and had chinese characters as subtitles that couldn't be taken off of the screen.  some scenes were missing and the quality was poor a lot of the times. this of course is not how it was advertised. i had to return the package and get them to replace it and even then the replacement was with the same issues.,1407801600,,349,4.208955223880597

2392078,1,B000ASDFJU,"Don't buy this set! Several of the discs are defective! I didn't realize this until after 30 days, so now I'm stuck with it.

If you've already purchased this set, make sure you review all the discs!",1403740800,,342,4.444444444444445
2392079,1,B000ASDFJU,I purchased this set in 2012 and watched a few episodes here and there and everything seemed fine. I recently decided to watch the entire series again from start to finish.

2392084,1,B000ASDFJU,Can't play it on anything but computer. Obviously it was made illegally. Random scratches throughout the episodes. And just horrible in general. Was NOT worth the wait for it to be delivered. Was NOT worth the price. This is the first time I have ever been disappointed in an amazon purchase.

2392088,5,B000ASDFJU,"I came to this series late.  My Daughters laughed about it and recommended it cautiously because they were afraid some of the explicit sexual encounters between the girls and various boyfriends would offend me.  They had quite the opposite effect - I laughed right out loud.  This is the most ""edgy"" TV, with women as the focus, ever produced.  So much of it is true and plainly stated.  The Producers really, really get ""us"".  Wish we women had many more new episodes (seasons) to enjoy the antics of these zany gals.  My oldest Daughter bought be two Sex and the City movies for my Birthday (68th).  They were equally entertaining.  Ladies, don't walk - run to your computer and order this collection.

I chose this particular set because it was sold at such a great price ($74.00) and was in excellent condition. It did not come with the cover or box that all the DVD's fit in, but I didn't particularly care about that. I recommend this set to any and all who loved this series.",1391558400,,419,4.0

2392105,4,B000ASDFJU,I was a HUGE fan of Sex and the City from the beginning-partly because I am roughly the same age as the character Carrie. I was astounded when I would watch an episode and view a conversation that I had had almost verbatim with a boyfriend/lover. Had they ended the story with the DVDs it would have been much better. The final episode tied up loose ends and the series ended on a high note. Besides- how can anyone not love the fashions?,1389225600,,438,4.289156626506024
2392106,3,B000ASDFJU,"I am so disappointed. Sex and the City is one of my all-time favorite shows. I was very excited to finally get this set for less than $100. It was my birthday gift to myself! Due to the fact that I have a 6-year-old and a non-fan of the show husband, it has taken me awhile to get to watch. The audio is a little off, but still watchable. My biggest complaint is the last DVD, season six part two, has a glitch near the end and I cannot even fast forward through it! The last several minutes of the final episode ever are unviewable!!!!! And since I have only just now discovered this, I am well past my return period. I guess I'll have to go over that $100 mark to purchase the final season separately. What a massive disappointment.",1389139200,,734,4.212765957446808
2392107,4,B000ASDFJU,"Series is fantastic.  I love this show, but some DVDs play better than others.  It's not my dvd player.  Just ...weird.",1389052800,,119,4.571428571428571

2392109,1,B000ASDFJU,The video quality was not good and some disc wouldn't play at all.  Wonder if I can return it even though it is opened.,1387411200,,119,3.9583333333333335
2392110,3,B000ASDFJU,"This box set is beautiful, but my dvds are all ""off."" The lips don't match the words often, so it's pretty annoying... I tried them in multiple dvd players, too. By the time I'd realized this, though, I didn't think I could return them and I'd gotten them as a Christmas gift.",1386460800,,276,4.326923076923077
2392111,2,B000ASDFJU,"I LOVE the SATC series and was thrilled when my husband bought me this for my birthday.  The picture quality is poor though, and seems to freezes or jolt from frame to frame sometimes.  Happens in every episode, not just one.  Also, the case is in bad shape.  It's supposed to be new and the box is beat up and cracked.  Very disappointing.  Going to return, not sure if I'm going to return for refund to buy somewhere else or exchange.  If I exchange it I'll update my review on my experience and if the picture quality is better.",1386115200,,531,4.303030303030303

Both box sets contain the six seasons 94 episodes, but this first box set produced in 2008 does not contain the two bonus movies that are included in the 2010 box set (also available on Amazon), and the extra bonus disc is not the same either.

I really enjoy this .  I can watch when it's convenient for me, not when cable tv finds time to aire certain of the series.  I recommend this to anyone who never got to wathc all of these series.

Many people who don't like this series are watching the heavily edited versions on other channels. Believe me, if that's all you've seen, you need to know that this series is pretty racy.

I am just now getting around to watching disc 3 of season 3 and when I tried to play the disc it started freezing up, making it unwatchable. I thought it was a problem with my computer but now I can see that it must be a manufacturing defect as numerous other people have mentioned having the same problem. That is at least five episodes that I will now be missing. I have also experienced consistent problems with the sound quality in most of the episodes. Whenever the characters are at a bar, party, art show, etc. and there is music playing in the background, the music is so loud that you can't hear any of the speaking parts.

I gave this as a gift, and my wife did not play them all until months later, when she found out one of the discs were defective. We got an exchange after some arm twisting.

The aggravation is not worth the price.  I bought this as a gift for my significant other, and we are highly disappointed.  This disc set makes me feel like a bad boyfriend every time we watch it because there are so many issues with it.

I tried to view it on my Macbook to see if there was a difference and the program clearly stated ""skipping over damaged area"".  Something is definitely wrong with these dvds.

The series is fantastic, of course, and I will leave others to comment on the content of the series.  My feedback is for the quality of the DVDs from Amazon, which I found to be unacceptable.  The product page actually warns potential buyers that those with poorer-quality players may experience playback issues.  Funny how these are the only DVDs I have ever had playback problems with.

While Season 1 did not have any playback issues, I have experienced issues so far on EVERY single disc for Seasons Two - Four.  Season 3 is almost unwatchable, while the other seasons are hit and miss.

Season 2 Disc 1 wouldn't not load at all on her laptop. A technician friend inspected the disc and noticed it was dirty and used rubbing alcohol to clean it (I would expect with the $71 price tag the discs would arrive at least clean!). After doing this the disc still failed to load, so he manually right clicked on the disc drive (E:/) and hit ""play with windows media player."" This did the trick and now the CD is loading properly. I was surprised as the other CDs loaded fine and only this one so far has given her trouble. Note: do not use the DIVX player to load the episodes, only the windows media player. The only positive mark is that a supervisor refunded me the $71 so I could purchase the ""Deluxe edition"" for $107 on amazon. Hopefully, the deluxe edition will not have this problem. I will update this posting when it arrives.

Update: The Sex and the City - White Deluxe Edition arrived and my girlfriend couldn't be happier. The episodes possess much better video quality and look like they are 720p. This is compared to the ""barely"" 360p of the Collectors Edition.

2392255,5,B000ASDFJU,"This show is a small glimpse into the madness that is womankind. For all the stereotypes about women this show often shows, I know that this is merely a fraction of the makeup of a real woman. This show centers around the character Carrie Bradshaw and her three closests friends and their adventures throughout New York City. It mainly explores their relationships with men, their desires and actions to be fabulous women and the often hilarious failures at trying those things.

About this particular box set all I can say is - it is beautiful. It comes in a book like format withthe DVD's in cardboars holders throughout the book with little notes and facts about the show. The covers are pink felt I think and it looks great on a shelf.",1355788800,,739,4.598484848484849

2392265,5,B000ASDFJU,"Now at only $71, this collection is a must-buy if you're a diehard SATC fan.  Remember when they used to be close to that much money per season?  Anyway, I am girl, but not usually into ""girly"" type shows.  My collection at home includes Breaking Bad, The Wire, The Sopranos, Oz, Deadwood, The Walking Dead, Mad Men, Carnivale, Eastbound and Down, Treme, Homeland, and um....Sex and the City?  I can't help it, I watch anything HBO - I've been doing it for years and only sometimes I am disappointed.  I was too young to watch this show when it first aired, but when I got a bit older and caught up, and have seen every episode many, many times.

The great thing about SATC is that the writing is actually GOOD.  It's not only a chick show (which it is, yes), but a wonderfully written chick show.  If there was less of Carrie reading in ""dear diary"" mode (well, her articles), less women, and more POV from men, I feel very strongly that this show would have been hugely popular with both sexes.  The writers are just funny and know how to write good comedy.  If you watch the movies, just listen to the difference in dialogue quality between here and there.  It's not even close.  The movies are miserable in every way compared to the show.

The great thing about this show is that it's just pure entertainment.  Many women are obsessed with the women characters of the show, but I just prefer to watch it purely for the laughs.  It is cleverly written and I like the characters, but its over-the-top lewdness and raunchy attitude mixed with genuine humor is what makes it special.  I watch SATC sometimes with my boyfriend in exchange for a back massage and he pretends he hates the show when we're not watching it, but he still laughs and used to say things like, ""I guess if you want to put the next episode on, you can...."" He's seen every episode about 4 times now though, so he's just getting sick of it, but yeah - anyone can enjoy this show, men and women.  It's just for fun, and now it's a classic.  Also, syndication ruins it.  They have to make sure to fit in commercials, so they automatically HAVE to shorten scenes, not to mention all of the nudity, cursing, and sex scenes are cut out...what's the fun of SEX and the City without that?!?!",1351641600,,2256,4.418886198547216

We are really disappointed.  We can't return it because shipping would be very expensive...so, we have to imagine the end of some episodes or read about it in the internet!!!  :( :( :(

I received SatC: The Complete Series as a Christmas gift, and it took me a while to go through all the discs, so I did not notice the problems within the 30 day window. A few months later I was frustrated to discover that some discs would not play at all, so I called Amazon and they let me send it in to exchange for a new set. I had the same problem with Round 2 so I returned it within the 30 day window and used the credit to give the Deluxe Edition a whirl. I'm much happier with that one. All the discs work - yay! Yes, it can be a little tough getting the discs in and out of the holders, but overall I like the presentation of the deluxe set much better, and it's nice knowing that I can pick an episode to watch with no anxiety about whether or not it will play.",1346716800,,845,3.9473684210526314

Up until season 2 it worked fine, but starting at episode 14 the disc stalled and wouldn't continue playing.  I tried to put it in my computer and for some reason it did play better, but was still stalling.  Episode 15 wouldn't play after the first 3 minutes.

It says new on the wrapper but there was a lot of dirt/dust/torn pieces of paper in between the plastic that the whole box slides in and out from.  Also, the  last page and inside of the hard cover are scraped through to the white part (both sides) as if something was between the pages and the book was closed tightly over it.  There was a big dust clot on that same spot but I just simply wiped it off. There are light scuffs on the spine of the book/dvds too but its really not too much of a big deal. Yes, it came in plastic wrap but it looks like it took a bit of a beating somewhere since the box it was shipped in was in great shape.  I really was hoping it would have came in the original thick acrylic case that the original release had.  I hope my discs work, I have yet to play any but after reading another review, I see I have a 2007 release so I hope it all plays through.",1337817600,,1022,3.936893203883495

I made a mistake on taking my time that it elapsed and cannot return it. I may have to purchase this episode to download it so I can be able to watch it. Bummer!!!",1335225600,,541,4.018518518518518

Also when I bought this I got it for about 80 dollars. Some DVDs had a white papery cover on them. The case itself was a lighter pink and velvety. Very pretty. The inside had each disc clearly marked and also a episode summary or quote from that episode. It also had pictures of the stars when separting each season. Probably not a dad gift unless he was super into the show ( I was really young when i remembered my dad watching this). Perfect for a fan, a collector or anyone that loves SJP!

In 2004, after the series had ended, I couldn't find anything to rent at the video store, so I figured what the hell? The first episode is a bit grainy, but thereafter it gets much better.  The wit of ALL of the characters astounds me! I can see a bit of each of the 4 girls in me and I'm sure that's the reason I was so drawn to this show and HAD to buy the complete series.  There's ALWAYS a situation that either you or someone you know has faced in this series and that's what made is such a smash hit to both women and men alike.  Hilarious and real.

Well I did not get through the entire series, but still came across two faulty disks from two separate seasons. The one episode would not play and all and just returned to the menu.

2392344,3,B000ASDFJU,"This review rates the following (in order):
Entourage
Rome
Californication
Spartacus
Weeds
Sex and the City
The Tudors
True Blood
Big Love

My wife and I have found that we enjoy these series better than watching individual movies.  I believe that we also would rank them in the same order, so this is a male/female friendly review.  As with all MoonDonkey reviews, it goes without saying that this is gospel.

I've tried to do this without including spoilers.

#1 Entourage (5 stars)
How could anything else be #1?  Entourage follows the career of movie star Vincent Chase and his group of friends.  This is the gold standard by which all other series are measured.  Plus, Entourage has the best one-liners of any series.  Unfortunately, I cannot include them in this review due to their graphic nature.

#2 Rome (5 stars)
Rome follows the exploits of two Roman soldiers - Verenus (the smarts) and Pullo (the brute).  Very well done.  For a historical drama, the sets are very well designed and believable.  In Rome, the idea is that you see the Roman Empire through the eyes of two soldiers as they experience the ups and downs of life.  My wife and I enjoyed this one a lot.

#3 Californication (5 stars)
Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this at first.  I pegged David Duchovny as an X-Files guy and wasn't sure what to make of him in this role.  Also, I wasn't sure what Californication was about anyway.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  In Californication, we follow the life and career of author Frank Moody - a chaotic and perhaps self-destructive individual who has a way with women.  Unfortunately for him, he is trying to balance the chaos of his life on one side with his teenage daughter and her mother (his love interest) on the other side.  The dude is a train-wreck and it makes for a great series.

#4 Spartacus (4 stars)
Spartacus is about a man who is captured and made a gladiator slave in the Roman Empire.  There is just of a bit of a drop off from the 5 star series to 4 star Spartacus.  Why?  Well, there just isn't as much of Spartacus.  Basically one season followed by a ""prequel"" season.  I believe that is because the original Spartacus actor died of cancer.  I'm not sure if there are future plans for the series or not.

Also, the effects take some getting used to.  There is definitely a CGI feel to some of the scenery.  The blood effects are similar to 300.

Regardless of those issues, Spartacus was highly enjoyable.  Even my wife, who was like ""what the heck"" after the first episode, came around and really enjoyed the series.  Maybe because they show sausage.  Some of the gladiator ""locker room"" scenes are like staring at a pack of Johnsonville brats.  There is a lot of blood and nudity in this one - as there should be given that this is a brutal depiction of life as a slave gladiator.

#5 Weeds (3 stars)
Weeds gets a golf-clap 3 star ranking.  Why?  Because the plot just doesn't make sense sometimes.  There are points in this series where you feel like it is going one way and then - boom - the plot takes a 90 degree turn towards something else.  It's not like it makes sense thought.  Rather, it feels more like a different writer came in to write a different episode or something.  It is very strange and it happens a number of times.

Weeds follows the life of a suburban mom who sells pot to make money after her husband dies.  The decision to become a dealer impacts her two sons and her husband's brother - who comes to live with her.  The series starts out with sort of a realistic ""how would this play in the suburbs"" feel, but then progresses down some more eccentric paths.

We have enjoyed the series, but this is not one that we were waiting at the mailbox for the next video to arrive.  It qualifies as a ""we will watch it when we get around to it"" series.

#6 Sex and the City (3 stars)
Sex and the City explores the lives of 4 single women and their quest for happiness and men in New York.  Why 3 stars?  This is the only series that my wife and I would disagree on the ranking.  I suspect she would give it 4 stars and I would give it two.  Frankly, it is too much of a ""chic flick"" for me... and I would guess most men feel the same way.

Wait you say - what about Entourage?  Isn't that basically the same thing with a group of guys?  In a word... no.  It isn't.  For some reason, Entourage just plays better that Sex and the City.  Also, the last couple seasons of Sex and the City really fell off a cliff.  It had the distinct feeling that they were just looking to wrap it up.

Also, speaking as a guy, this series became too ""cultish"" for me.  Do you know how many women started drinking cosmos because of this series?  For that matter, do you know how many ""Rabbits"" sold because of this series?  Sex and the City became sort of a female cultural event.  Guys - that really tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it?

#7 The Tudors (3 stars)
This is a tough one.  The Tudors is a story about the life of Henry V of England and his many wives.  It is good, but I think many people just won't get into this series.  It doesn't have the craziness of Entourage or Californication, nor the blood and guts of Rome and Spartacus.  The Tudors is more of a historical drama.  Consider The Tudors a 3 star teetering on the edge of a 2 star.  I prefer Weeds to The Tudors.  However, I think my wife would maybe rank this a bit higher.

If you choose to watch this series, I strongly recommend committing to watching the first 3-4 episodes at least.  If you just watch one or two, you probably won't stick with it.

I tell you what though - one of the most interesting things about The Tudors is all of the torture.  Watching The Tudors makes any modern ""torture"" techniques look laughable.  Water-boarding?  Bah, that's for sissies!  Give me the rack!

#8 True Blood (2 stars)
True Blood is about life in a small town after vampires have come out of the closet and try to live normal lives with humans... or at least that is what it starts out to be.

Look - I'd love to rate True Blood higher, but the series just gets weirder and weirder as it goes on.  It is like the writers got bored with the standard vampire-human conflict thing so they had to take it in several other directions... and I do mean several.  Suddenly we have werewolves, witches, shape-shifters, fairies, etc, etc.  It gets to the point where you are asking yourself, really?  Really?
I'd give the first season alone 4 stars, but it drops of to 3 stars and then to 2 stars after that.

#9 Big Love (1 star)
Big Love is about a mormon family practicing polygamy.  The story follows the life of one man and his many wives.  My wife liked this a bit more than I did, but it just didn't do it for me.  There really wasn't anything about the show that I found interesting.  I think my wife enjoyed some of the relationship drama, but she stopped watching the series and hasn't expressed an interest in continuing it.  This one was a burn-out.  I think it is because Big Love is maybe too serious - if it had a Californication element to it, I bet it would have been pretty entertaining.

So there you have it my friends.  I may continue to update this list as we watch more series.  The nutshell is that HBO appears to be focusing on more high-end ""production"" type series and Showtime is focusing on lower cost dramas.",1322438400,,7366,4.346323529411765

2392369,3,B000ASDFJU,"When ""Sex and the City"" first aired on HBO, I was still attending public high school and living with my parents. Needless to say, the series did not immediately grab me and hold my interest. Now that I am a grown man living in the urban sprawl of Baton Rouge, I have finally been able to go back and appreciate this noteworthy television series. Through these five years, ""Sex and the City"" has gone through a slow and steady transformation, a transformation that may indeed reflect the changes dating women experience between the ages of 35 and 45. Watching episodes pulled from the first and fifth seasons quickly reveals a dramatic change between the flirty and fun, sex-loving characters of old and the cynic, unappealing, but ultimately wiser women they've become.

Season 2 of the series, in my opinion, describes the crystallization of style the first season attempted to reach, with thematic plots differing from episode to episode to follow Cory's most recent magazine article. Cory seems to have an unnatural gift with words and finds a way to include each of the four characters' escapades into the focal concept of each episode. The overall style is busy and lighthearted, and Cory herself remains the only character especially affected by the tragedies of love. By season 3, however, Cory's complicated love life is beginning to crumble her resolve, and both Corvette and Mirando have fallen into equally committed relationships with Tom and Jerry. Once Semolina begins to experiment with monogamous relationships, the transition is unarguably complete. One can also witness a parallel evolution in style and cinematography, such as scene length and method of cuts between one scene and its parallel. By the third season, interviews with passersby have vanished: a flag that may indicate the disappearing universal application of episode themes to our own lives and the increasing specialization of character development and history within the plot.

""Sex and the City"" of today is not what it once was. Like all middle-aged females, the women of ""Sex and the City"" must learn to move on from sexual promiscuity and hide behind the security of committal relationships or die alone and unloved. Which fate will befall Cory and her dear friends?",1314489600,,2256,5.078167115902965
2392370,5,B000ASDFJU,"Overall I loved the Sex and the City The Series! The disks were in good shape, and I love the product. I would recommend this to everyone who loves Sex and the City! :)",1313971200,,168,3.9705882352941178
2392371,4,B000ASDFJU,Most of the discs played but there were a couple that had certain episodes that wouldn't play or wouldn't play the whole thing just the beginning. That's awful especially if you are watching Sex and the City for the first time and when doing a Marathon. I really wish I could have watched all of them but I still love the series!!!,1313366400,,331,4.354838709677419

My only complaint is that 3 of the discs were scratched so that I was unable to watch a few of the episodes. It's fun to follow the lives of Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha.

2392385,1,B000ASDFJU,"When I watched it on DVD years ago, I thought it was funny. I finally bought the whole set, and watched it again.  Still liked it somewhat  Even bought the film.

But the last time I watched it, I thought it was boring and silly and found myself fast forwarding through half of it.  Nobody acts like that, At least I hope not. I mean ALL the conversation was about sex.  All of it.  Sigh.....  Occasionally they talked clothes or shoes, but most all of it was about sex, and Samantha was ridiculous.  Does anybody really dress the way they did and act as disgusting as Samantha?  I hope not.  Carrie should have thrown Big out of her mind, after his sudden trip to Paris and combed her hair once in a while. Aiden was a nice guy, but it seems Carrie didn't like nice guys.  Miranda just didn't work with the bartender, although he was one of the few nice characters in the movie.  And Samantha and her waiter/movie star completely insane.  I threw the whole thing out.  I would have given away, but nobody wanted it.",1311120000,,1016,4.335106382978723
2392386,5,B000ASDFJU,"I have been wanting to purchase the Complete Series from the moment I saw it! (Even though my sister and I already owned all 6 seasons.) Finally, I gave in and purchased the set, and I am certainly glad I did. This is the perfect gift for any SATC fan; the packaging is beautiful with pink velvet (I am sure Carrie would approve) and the inside is sleek. The discs are separated by season, each with descriptions of the episodes and beautiful pictures of all the girls throughout the seasons. The Collector's gift-set also includes a bonus disk with music and commentary from the show.

On the downside, I have experienced some difficulty playing some episodes on my laptop. This may not be the problem normally, as most people play DVDs with a DVD player (haha) but it has been frustrating. I am not quite sure if it is the lap top or the actually disks, but it is very disappointing. Besides that, I would highly recommend this gift set to all; I purchased one for my sister's birthday and she loves it as well!",1310169600,2,1013,4.475675675675675

Now, I get to see everything that happened with these friends, in the order that it happened.  Despite its racy title, there is more to this show then sex.  There are relationships, friendships, fashion and just day to day survival in a big city.  I have the entire series, plus the two full length movies.  The best thing is, you can watch your favorite episode as many times as you like!",1307923200,,511,4.56043956043956

So like many others, I also had problems with the dvds not playing properly, some episodes wouldn't play at all...especially on the season 3 discs (So even though it may be a pain, make sure you test the dvds when you get them, so you're not stuck with dvds that don't work....I would start with season 2 & 3 since they seem to be the most problematic). So I sent back to Amazon, who apologized and sent me another set, well the same exact thing happened. I checked the back of the dvds to make sure they weren't damaged, which they weren't, so I decided to try using my computer to see if they would play...and sure enough, they did. So then I tried putting them in an old, cheap dvd player that we never used and sure enough they worked on that one too. For some reason though, they won't work right on our newer sony bluray/dvd player. The only thing I can think of, is that maybe some of the newer players don't correspond to the formatting of how the show is copied over onto the dvd's??? Anyways, I ended up sending the set back to Amazon for a refund and decided to purchase the Sex and the City: Complete Series (DELUXE Edition....the one in the white leather case) because it was a newer release (2010) and I thought that maybe because of that, it would play properly in my bluray player. And sure enough, they played absolutely perfect!! I was so happy and relieved that I finally got working dvds. The drawbacks are that the Deluxe version is more expensive and the way the dvds are packaged in this set are alittle difficult to remove, but not impossible and despite what some of the reviews say about the Deluxe set, the holders don't scratch the dvds when you pull them out as long as your not being overly agressive with them. Plus, the holders do loosen up a bit after awhile. So I can say that I'm more than happy with the Deluxe set and it was well worth it to me to spend alittle more, plus the packaging of the deluxe set is so much nicer.
So my suggestion to those who would like to own this set, is try out this version first and if it doesn't play right on your player, spring for the Deluxe Edition. Amazon is really great with exchanges/refunds if you do need to send things back....just as long as you're in the 30 day refund period. Good luck, I hope this review was helpful and enjoy the show, because Sex and the City is an awesome show!",1307232000,4,2404,4.320796460176991

2392404,5,B000ASDFJU,"Sex and the City is a true gem; the type of show that doesn't come around every day. It is incredibly well-written and acted, and is always entertaining. Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw is so convincing as a single 30-something sex columnist living in Manhattan that you almost feel like you're watching a reality show - except the cinematography is light years ahead. The conversation between the 4 friends (Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha) is very realistic, and makes you feel as if you're having drinks with your girlfriends. The show's intelligent writing is sometimes pretty R-rated, and the episodes often contain graphic sex scenes - not for children's eyes. All the boyfriends out there who buy this box set as a gift for their girlfriends might get easily maxed-out on chick-flick type banter, but overall, it's a good show regardless of gender. I once made an ex-boyfriend of mine sit through several episodes, and I caught him laughing out loud several times. This entire series is addictive - once you watch one, it's hard to stop because each one is so good. This set will easily keep you entertained for months.

What a waste of money!!! Do not buy this!! So ridiculous! If the discs would have played properly, it would have been amazing.",1298332800,2,613,4.5636363636363635
2392424,2,B000ASDFJU,The series was good.  The only problem is that the same disc from season 6 part two disc 2 I had two of them and was missing season 6 part one disc 2 so I had to go back on amazon and purchase season 6 part one disc 2 to watch the four episodes that were missing from the seller I bought it from.

I actually purchased this gift set some time ago but had to comment on how the packaged product affects the quality of the discs.  At first look, the item is pretty stylish.  A book binder full of discs. Unfortunately, the discs are held in place with paper slots which scratch the surface of the cds. I'm annoyed because one of my discs skips now.

The product arrived completely intact, none of the disks were scratched, and the plush cover felt soft and undamaged. My only qualm about it was how long it took to arrive, as it left me feeling a little nervous. However, I ordered my movies during the holidays, and there were several snow storms that hit right around that time, so I understand the delay in delivery. Overall, I had a wonderful experience with amazon, and will likely order something again in the future !",1295827200,,638,4.415254237288136

2392446,2,B000ASDFJU,"Nothing went wrong with the order itself; it arrived on time (early, in fact)and the payment was taken from my account promptly.

When I started to watch, however, is when I started to notice the problems.  I've only gotten as far as Season 3, Episode 3 but in general, the picture quality on all discs leaves a lot to be desired.  Maybe it's because I have a hi-def TV and the show definitely wasn't filmed in hi-def, but the picture is very pixellated and I know I've seen it much clearer on TV.  Also, about 2 or 3 minutes of an episode in Season 1 seems to have been erased...it just pauses for a second and then moves on to the next part of the episode.  To top it off (this is the most aggrevating discovery I've made thus far), you can't even turn the subtitles off on Season 3!

The most disappointing thing is that I'm now outside of the 30 day return window.  How is anyone going to find all of the problems with this in the 30 days?  I can't sit and watch the show in a marathon, so it'll be months before I get to the series finale.",1292716800,,1044,4.133663366336633

I checked and all the DVDs were there (I guess there was an empty space). I apologize for the bad review, as the quality of the filming cannot be responsibility of the vendor; I guess it's because it was filmed in the 80's. I appreciate that the vendor quickly replied and offered to replace the series with a new one, which was not necessary.

HUGE Sex and the City Fan!!

Was so excited to get the entire series, BUT

The first season, AT EACH EPISODE, I had to turn the closed caption off!!  EVERY TIME!!  Very irritating.

Season two - not bad.  Had to turn off the closed caption every time I inserted a new disc.  I can handle that.

The next seasons, you COULDN'T TURN THE CLOSED CAPTIONING OFF!!!!!!!  VERY IRRITATING!!  GAVE ME A HEADACHE!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!

Last season, had to turn off the closed caption each episode.  By the time I was done with the series, I don't think I will EVER watch it again!!!!!!!!",1285718400,,608,4.458715596330276
2392454,4,B000ASDFJU,"The seller was very quick to ship, and the product was well packaged. The selling price was reasonable.  As for the box set, there were a few noticeable differences between the ""same"" DVD box set I had purchased previously from a well-known retail outlet and this one, purched via this Amazon vendor. (Having already owned, and viewed this box set, I had a comparative perspective.) Specifically: the ""box"" in which the box set was packaged was a very thin, soft, plastic sleeve, and not the hard plastic sleeve the other set had. The photo pages included in the box set were wrinkled as if they had been exposed to water, and were printed on thin paper, which almost made me think they were photocopied. The DVDs were a slightly different color, and, when played, predominantly had the subtitles turned on, and I had to turn them off at the start of every episode. The episodes played from one to the next in order, and only returned to the DVD menu when the last episode on that DVD had ended, rather than returning to the episode (for that disc menu each time and episode on a disc ended. The default option for each episode was to watch a preview of the episode rather than to play the episode, so you had to take care to choose the correct option if you wanted to just play the episode. One very interesting aspect of the DVDs is that there have been scenes here and there in episodes that I know well, that were different than I had seen before; (vastly different) almost as if I was watching the unreleased episodes. Really a funny and pleasant surprise. My thought was that this was either a bootleg version of the DVD set, or a version originally for non-US release. It has been amusing for sure. All in all, the DVD set was a good price and does include amusing, slightly alternate versions of the episodes. The seller provided quick shipping and courteous service.

2392461,4,B000ASDFJU,"Sex and the City is not a masterpiece. It is not the greatest show ever created. It is, however, generally good fun. The characters are a little uneven at times -- Carrie, for instance, seems to grow very little over the course of the show, while Miranda has a very satisfying arc and ends up a nearly completely different person.

I will say that the 6th and final season is *fantastic*, and well worth the build up. Watching the first movie with my wife without having seen any of the series, I thought it was decent. I've heard the second movie is ... not as decent. But I truly believe that if the two-part season finale had been released as a movie, it would have garnered critical acclaim. It's that good.

The actual box set is cute, nothing to gush over. The extras are sparse, but the episodes are all there. If you're looking for something to keep the insane Sex and The City fanatic occupied for years, you're out of luck, but really, it's what I expected.

Don't buy this set expecting a life changing event. But if you want to see a show that generally entertains, occasionally surprises, and always pushes boundaries, it's worth picking up.",1280188800,,1154,4.538461538461538

Even though it was brand new some of the DVD came with minor scratches. That is due to the poor manufacture design. I mean whoever thought that the sleeves were a good idea is dead wrong. Even if they would have charged a little extra they should have made it clip on's, there was plenty of space for it. Also the plastic that it comes in is soft. When this set first came out it was a hard plastic which it looks better.
Thankfully i had no problems with the DVD at all. I was one of the lucky ones. The set is beautiful. I bought something called dskin. It protects the dvd, though it is a little expensive. I bought just what i needed online from Walmart. Since i don't plan to only watch this set ones with the sleeves the DVD can get scratched.

2392475,5,B000ASDFJU,"This ""Sex and the City"" boxset is the ultimate collector's item for fans of the series that followed the lives of four women living in New York City between 1998-2004. Many know Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and the sex-craved Samantha as being four best friends who search for love while maintaining great careers and facing life's obstacles while realizing nothing is too hard to conquer as long as they have each other to rely on.
 This spelndid box set features all 94 episodes of the long-running HBO series on 20 dics. One of those discs is a bonus DVD that features interviews with the cast, behind-the-scenes clips, and more. The two ""Sex and the City"" films are not a part of this set as the films themselves were released after this set arrived in stores.
 Many have complained of the way the DVD's were packaged as they slip into folded covers in a book, not being housed in the hard plastic that most DVD's are kept, so keep that in mind when purchasing this item. You can also purchase all six seasons of ""Sex and the City"" individually like I did. As of 2010 HBO has rereleased all six years separately in new, neat packaging with new art work.

Our experience is that the episodes skip from time to time.  We tried them on two DVD players and two notebook computers with the same response.

I didn't watch a single episode until after I was forced to watch the movie and discovered that I fell in love with each of the girls in two hours time.  I went through and rented each of the seasons and soon discovered that I NEEDED to own them.  I watch Sex and the City most mornings while I get ready for work because it's so fun and upbeat.

Now to this product specifically.  I have been able to watch all of the disks, however I have found that several of them freeze as if they are dirty and it takes a minute for my dvd player to read them.  I'm not thrilled with that since I JUST bought this product, so clearly I haven't had time to scratch or soil it.  The disks come in a BEAUTIFUL pink velvet covered photo album with episode details, fun quotes, and gorgeous pics of each of the ladies before the start of each season.

Overall I am very happy with the purchase, but I worried about how well the disks will read in a year if they are already having problems after a week or two.  That's the only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five.",1273276800,,1110,4.101851851851852

2392484,4,B000ASDFJU,"It may be a landmark and a turning point for a whole generation, yes, of course. But ""Sex And the City"" is, first of all, an extremely entertaining, cleverly written portrait of living in New York in the late 90's/early 2000's - and that is regardless of your genre.
The series deals primarily with relationships (its pursuit, the lack of it, what happens when you got it, what happens when you're through with it) and that is universal.
Not all characters were satisfyingly developed from the get-go, and the series itself took some time to find its own identity. Season 1 was very experimental, but when it found its voice, it became notorious, and unforgettable.
It's completely addictive and I have just revisited the whole series as a preparation for the second movie - and I have to say I can still find different nuances in some episodes. There's a lot to think about in it.

A month and a half later I finally got my movies. The set was shrink rapped in unmarked plastic, which at the time I did not notice. However, as I got more of the coverings off I realized everything had tiny scratches and marks... like the kind all movies get after being watched a few times. I decided to over-look the problem as the scratches were not too bad. However, when I went to watch the movies, it became very apparent the scratches were too bad to be able to watch the movies smoothly. There were skips and other problems with the disks...

Ive watched about 4 episodes total of this show with my girlfriend. Not only was there not much of a plot to these episodes but the voice over of Sarah Jessica Parker throughout the entire episode kind of wears on you. All the men in the show are either gay or are made out to be a tyrant of some sort. And basically it just seems like a show were a group of women complain about their encounters and love life. Blah blah blah blah blah............. I really don't see the appeal to this at all.,1264377600,3,607,4.1525423728813555

I've tried on my computer DVD player and my regular DVD player and the episodes freeze up or won't play at all. My friend's set had a couple of episodes freeze up but I figured her discs may have been scratched. My set is brand new. I am so upset. I love the show but I won't pay 100.00+ dollars for only half of the episodes!! Do not purchase this set.

If it were Bluray format, I could see the price. Also, many people complain that the packaging scratches DVDs, which I can see. If it were Bluray, it wouldn't scratch so easily and there would be less disks to manage.

I had the option of purchasing the complete series with other additions...I think it included memorabilia, etc.  However, the complete series (minus the additional stuff) was on sale and going for a very good price so I did not want to delay.  What I really wanted was the DVDs and not necessarily the additions so I went ahead and bought it.  To date however, I have not been able to watch the complete series because I have two children under three and life has been very hectic.  However, I am sure the DVDs will be good when they get older and I have more time, so I will definately watch the series....eventually.

While I wish there had been more extras, I still think that this set is a must-have for fans.

After getting the same result when we tried to play it in other players, we returned it to amazon for a replacement set.  When the replacement set arrived, we encountered the exact same problem!

I started looking around for the series and I was turned off by the idea of having to by each season separately.  I live in a studio and I honestly do no have room for all of the seasons.  I saw an advertisement inserted in the sex and the city movie for the complete series box set.  I had to get it!  This is one of the best movies purchases I have ever made!  I looked at Barnes and Nobel and Borders they had the movie for sale for almost $300!!!!  I love amazon! I bought it for $115 with overnight shipping! What a deal.

Its too expensive for me to have recieved dvds i couldn't even watch.

2392580,4,B000ASDFJU,"Although I don't understand why, instead of New York the city of Paris was the setting for its final episodes, SEX AND THE CITY stands as a memorable adults-only melodrama.  Now that's it's only on television in censored edits on a basic cable station, you must see these D.V.D.s for everything H.B.O. viewers got to watch years ago.

Fortunately it's Kim Cattrall, the show's hottest actress, who does nude scenes most freqently on SEX AND THE CITY - and shows the most of her incredible body.  Cynthia Nixon does a few topless shots and Kristin Davis takes her top off once or twice but neither girl lets you see more than that.  The show's star, Sarah Jessica Parker, keeps her clothes on despite that great figure of hers - not even thong panties.

But Parker's character Carrie is the most interesting one on SEX AND THE CITY, chasing men who mistreat her and rejecting the guys who are good to her, the former represented most often by a guy she calls Big, the latter a boyfriend named Aiden.  And it does not seem to be Big's money or Aiden's good-not-great income that makes the difference to her.  Carrie just wants what she can't have.  Oddly, SEX AND THE CITY never has Carrie realize this, as the show's final episodes indicate.

My biggest complaint about SEX AND THE CITY is that these women are so well-off they have more time than they should to worry about men.  Toward the end of the series, however, there is a story about one of the women that adds a dose of reality to the fantasy lives they live.  But overall SEX AND THE CITY's lives and loves of a public relation executive, art gallery director, newspaper columnist, and attorney don't reflect what life in the Big Apple is like for the vast majority of the women who live there.  How about making the four lead actresses, say, a nurse's aid, retail store cashier, house cleaner, and receptionist?",1234137600,,1872,4.588588588588588

So there are a lot of scratches, some bad enough to make the dvd unplayable.  Same problem with the second set.  I would recommend the series, and the Collector's Giftset idea is great, but because of poor packaging, I can only give 2 stars.  NOTE:  Amazon was terrific about replacing the defective item.

2392614,5,B000ASDFJU,I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas. The packaging for the item was very nice. It was all put into an album and each disc was in a seperate pocket. It was almost like a CD holder but nicer. My daughter was impressed with how nice it looked.,1231286400,,253,4.08
2392615,5,B000ASDFJU,"Sex and the City sounded as a cheap thrills to me at first.  I ignored the TV series for the first three years of its successful existence.  I argued with my daughters about the intellectual and stylistic merits of the series... till one day I watched a couple of episodes On Demand.  Then, I watched another couple episodes... and I was hooked.  Sex and the City is not about sex alone.  Women are not about sex, sorry Samantha.  (I never met anyone like Samantha anyway).  We are all about relationships.  If you have no friends, Sex and the City makes sure that you are ever alone.  The show is uplifting, liberating, romantic, cynical, totally unrealistic (who wants a realistic show when we tune in to escape our reality!); it is beautiful, sharp, smart, creative, inspiring.  I even forgive the color and the texture of the cover - pink plush?! - too much Carrie...  Description are NOT helpful.  I skip them both in the book and on the screen.  I find it too elaborate or not specific enough and ambiguous at times.
I bought the entire series for the video content and I enjoy every minute of it no mater how many times I re-watch my favorite episodes.  Great original show!",1231200000,,1181,4.561904761904762
2392616,5,B000ASDFJU,"I've been trying to record this series off of the reruns on TV, but it hasn't worked very well, and there are the terrible awful commercials to contend with (I don't have TIVO). Plus, I don't care for the censored version they show on family channels, so I've wanted to buy this for a long time. The only thing that stopped me was the prohibitive cost - $300 - eek! Finally I found it for $99, and bought it immediately. It's so much fun to just randomly pick a disc and watch it. I love these gals!",1231200000,,499,4.154639175257732

2392620,4,B000ASDFJU,"My husband bought me this as a gift for my birthday, and I do love it so.  After quite some time, I am finally reaching the end of the series, when I made a somewhat confusing discovery... I've been watching all of the episodes in consecutive order.  Well last night I watched the last disc that is in my set...  ""Season 6, Part One, Disc 3"".  I seem to be missing the discs for ""Season 6, Part 2"".  The episode description pages are there for this, but there aren't even sleeves in the binder for the discs.  Where are the last episodes?  There is also a Bonus Disc, but that's just bonus material, no episodes.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has had this occur.  I'm really bummed out if I got a bad box set here.  It was purchased way to long ago to think about returning it.  Please reply if you have any answers.  Thanks!",1231113600,,830,4.2165605095541405
2392621,5,B000ASDFJU,"The only thing better than watching Sex in the City on tv is watching it commercial free as it's meant to be.  It is clear and enjoyable to watch a disk at a time rather than 30 minutes at a time.  The bonus disk is good, too.  Good deal!",1230940800,,238,3.816326530612245
2392622,5,B000ASDFJU,"I got this box set as a gift, and I am sooo glad! I am a huge fan of Sex and the City, but never got any of the seasons, I was considering buying this for a long time now. But I got it as a gift before I had the chance.
I think this is a beautiful set, it is put together very well! The outside is lovely, and feels great. The inside is just beautiful as well, very nicely put together. It has each season divided up, and then a description on each episode. I totally love it!
I have read reviews where they talk about the cardboard that is holding the disc and how it scratches them when removing a disc. This is so not true, for me at least! If you jerk the disc out, then yes they will be scratched. However, if you slighty pull up on the disc and slowly remove them, then they are fine. I have removed all disc, and not scratched a one yet.
I would say if you love the show and want all the seasons, this is for you!",1230768000,,920,3.8473684210526318

2392624,3,B000ASDFJU,"Good :  In sequential order, each and every episode, fabulous looking set.  Beautiful pictures of the four girls, and great descriptions of each episode!

Bad : Cheap binder and paper, cheap fake velour cover, and cheap disc sleeves.  Binder-type style that doesn't fit with other dvd's in your collection.  No play all option that I can see, so if you're planning on watching a ""marathon"" be prepared with the remote (cause that 30 minutes goes quick :)

It's definitely a great collection.  However, I likely wouldn't have bought it for myself because of the cheaply made binder and the ridiculous retail price.  But because it was a gift, I'm enjoying every fabulous moment :)",1230249600,,679,4.894736842105263

2392626,1,B000ASDFJU,This series would have been a great buy if it had worked.  We popped these discs in and they played on every dvd player we could find but there is something wrong with the discs.  They will not play every episode.  It's as if they get stuck because of a bad manufacturing.  I'm convinced it is not our dvd players.  It was very frustrating to have spent the money for the complete series and still not be able to watch every episode.  I don't have alot of faith in returning items and i'm not convinced we would recieve a better set anyways.,1229817600,4,541,4.254901960784314

2392628,5,B000ASDFJU,"My daughter wanted this for Christmas, but it was so expensive I shopped on Amazon for a better price.  I was a little nervous buying from a different seller thru Amazon, but service was great.  I was very relieved that when the DVD's arrived the box was exactly the same as the expensive ones I had seen in retail stores - I was afraid for such a low price I would get something different.  She won't open it until Christmas so I trust everything inside the pink box is there and in good working condition (received with the cellophane still on).  So I am very relieved and happy.",1229212800,,581,4.351851851851852

2392631,4,B000ASDFJU,"If you're reading this review, you probably already love the series. And having it on DVD is great - especially compared to watching the watered-down version on broadcast TV.

My only complaint is how grainy the images are, at least through the first season or two. I know this is probably how it was shot, and not the fault of the DVDs, but it is still annoying. Not enough to not recommend the discs, but be aware of this before you buy.",1228262400,2,439,4.353658536585366

One minor complaint though, one of the pages of the booklet had a tear in it, straight out of the packaging.  That was really disappointing, but other than that, all smiles:)",1228003200,,414,4.074074074074074

The box was bigger, darker pink in colour, fake-looking and had pictures of the 4 ladies in front. I returned it. The 2nd time I bought, it came in a lookalike of the Retail version, the packaging was in Light Pink Velvet binder. However, the outer plastic box was flimsy, discs inside were ""protected"" in ""plastic bags"" but had scratches, printing was poor. It looked like a different batch or maybe someone copied the design. Finally, on my 3rd buy, I received the Retail Version found in stores. No glue and all the discs are playing properly so far.

There are nice photo pages with summaries of the episodes.  Each season has it's own color.  I've watched the 2nd season DVDs, and they all work in my PS2 DVD player.

The only problem I had was the defect with the pages inside the pick cover.  The top and bottom corners were not cut well - so somewhat ragged while the rest of the edges are cut straight and clean.

Some of my DVDs are un-playable. I even replaced certain seasons so I could watch favorite episodes, only to have these DVDs go bad as well. My DVD player is excellent and I have many DVDs of different things. I never had trouble with any except the ones of Sex and the City, so I know it's not my player. Did I watch these DVDs often? You bet. Since I loved them and enjoyed seeing them again and again. However, I have played and replayed other DVDs too such as Law and Order: SVU with no diminuation of quality.

Not only do the Sex and the City DVDs go bad with repeated viewings, the containers they come in are of shoddy quality as well. They are made of brittle plastic which breaks easily. The sets do not contain a list of episodes. It seems HBO just made them as cheaply as possible.

As most people had said it was the packaging that damages the discs I instantly bought something else to move the discs to. I did notice some of them didn't look perfect but was being optimistic.

When I went home I tested the discs out.. now although I haven't watched every episode yet I did test every disc and watched part of an episode on each disc and it seems my discs are all ok. I do agree with all the other posters that while the packaging looks great the slots the DVDs actually sit in are stupid and they definitely can affect the discs.",1222300800,2,664,4.312

After reading the reviews of bad disc I decided to watch some tonight. I could not even get the first disc out! It was glued to the paper! After removing it I attempted to clean the glue with a disc cloth, it did not matter. The disc will not play and skips.

And talking about men and sex, for the sake of being provocative, I just wasn't sure.  I was wrong!

All the seasons of Sex & the City were entertaining.  They were all fun, sexy, interesting, intelligent, funny.  And very fashionable of course!  I did have a bit of fun watching the girls dress up in outrageous outfits, or seeing Carrie's shoe closet.  Living a bit vicariously through them, living in NY, and that whole scene.  I fell in love with the show and the characters.  Esp. some of the boyfriends.

It was fun to see a show be original, to dare to talk about things that other shows won't.  I highly recommend this show.  I didn't buy it, I rented it disc by disc, which is the cheaper way to go.

2392699,5,B000ASDFJU,"SEX AND THE CITY was originally designed as an un-censored sitcom which single 30-something women could relate to.  While it succeeded in that, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly the show reached out to a far broader audience.  It centers around 4 middle-aged single female friends, so it's best to start out by meeting our friends.

***Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) is the main character in the show, and the title of the show is based on a column by the same name that she writes for a NYC newspaper.  She is a bit flighty and her favorite words are ""fabulous"" and ""fantastic.""  Her favorite drink is the Cosmopolitan and she is addicted to buying high heel shoes (she has maxed out many a credit card on shoe shopping trips!).  She discusses the issues of each episode in her column.  While a bit flakey and impulsive, her heart is in the right place in spite of some ethical lapses that she has from time to time.

While she has  sundry short-term flings, Carrie has three major boyfriends during the show.  One of them is Aiden Shaw (John Corbett) who is just about the best fellow any girl could ask for.  Of course, Corbett is one of my favorite actors, so I'm a bit biased towards his characters.

Carrie and Aleksander Petrovsky (Mikhail Baryshnikov) make an odd couple as they live in different worlds.  He is cultured and sophisticated, while her idea of culture is wearing $400 high heel shoes.  He is a Russian artist who is a bit over-bearing and self absorbed.  The biggest single problem is that he never seems to have any time for poor Carrie.

The most important male figure in the show is Mr. Big (Chris Noth).  From the pilot episode on, the lives of Carrie & Mr. Big weave in & out of each other.  He is a wealthy playboy who looks like he is just stepped out of GQ magazine.  Unfortunately for Carrie, he is commitment-phobic.

Carrie strikes out on the skin-o-meter as we only see her in sexy lingerie and occasionally a sheer blouse.

***Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon) is a graduate of Harvard Law & is by far the most cerebral of our friends.  She is out to prove that she can make it in a man's world.  She and Carrie have a special connection.  She is the most cynical character on the show, and she complains the most about not being able to find Mr. Right.  Strange as it is, she eventually discovers that Mr. Right was right in front of her nose in the character of a bartender named Steve (David Eigenberg).

On the skin-o-meter, Miranda takes her top off occasionally.

***Charlotte York (Kristen Davis) is my favorite character, and I doubt that I'm alone in that.  She is a true Romantic and a dreamer.  She imagines her knight in shining armor rescuing her from being single and providing her life with a fairy-tale ending.

Unfortunately for Charlotte, the knight who rescues her (Trey, played by Kyle MacLachlan)  ends up being a decent fellow who has serious intimacy problems.  He is also from a rather arrogant family with an especially annoying mother.

Charlotte eventually trades in Trey for a regular-Joe lawyer named Harry (Evan Handler).  Like Miranda, she finds that her soul-mate fits very few of her pre-conceived notions of what he would be like.  She isn't even physically attracted to him, but falls in love with his big generous heart.

On the skin-o-meter, Charlotte is briefly topless & 1/2 topless in the episodes FRENEMIES and ANCHORS AWAY.  We see her lovely posterior for a few seconds on WOULDA, COULDA, SHOULDA.

****Samantha Jones (Kim Catrall) is the most promiscuous of our 4 friends.  She is anti-relationship, and prides herself on being thus.  For her, the only use men have is to fulfill her carnal desires.  As such, Samantha and Charlotte are antipodes.

In spite of her cynical outlook, a young stud named Smith Jarrod (Jason Lewis) eventually changes her mind about the futility of having genuine human relations with the male gender.

While the 4 characters are all very different, they all share a love for fashion;  they literally never wear the same outfit twice.  {Alas, a jeans & T-shirt fellow like myself would be apt to be out-of-place trying to date any of them}.  Some of the stuff they wear is a bit outrageous & over-the-top;  particularly some of the dresses that Carrie dons.

While the show on a superficial level is a light-hearted comedy, it tackles some very serious issues such as:  surviving cancer, fertility problems / wanting to have a baby, unexpected pregnancies, deciding whether or not to get married and also caring for elderly relatives afflicted with Alzheimers.

Ultimately, the #1 reason I love the show so much is due to the fact that each of the 4 central characters share a zest for life.  They show us (both men & women) that being single is supposed to be fun as opposed to seeming hopeless.  While the constant tributes to New York City occasionally gets old for a midwesterner like myself, it is also pretty honest as to how New Yorkers think of themselves & their city.  In any case, each & every time I watch SEX AND THE CITY I always feel like I'm having lunch with 4 of my favorite friends.  I feel as though their struggles and triumphs are my own, given that I can vicariously relate to so many things they go through.  Kind of odd for a single heterosexual male to admit that, eh?",1214697600,9,5312,4.647690655209452

But if I was buying it now, and the 2007 set is $199, and the 2005 is $196, I would get the 2005 set just so I could have the plexiglass box that protects the pink velvet cover.  It just goes along with the fancy shoes, and self-indulgence of the show.  And it is so far from my life of crayons, diapers, and strep throat that is being a mom and nurse.

You have to look at the UPC...that's the only discernable difference between them (even the sets currently selling in stores with the free movie ticket say ""2005 Home Box Office"" in the fine print on the back, but they have the 2008 UPC..i checked at Target the other day!).  There are three different releases floating around: 2005, 2007, and the 2008 release that comes with the free movie ticket.  Amazon is not even selling the 2008 version at this time so I doubt anyone will be getting the free movie ticket.

2392727,5,B000ASDFJU,"Hi all SATC fans! Like the the first two reviewers, I wondered what the difference between this collection, currently on sale for $109.99, and the ""Collector's Edition"" on sale for $196.99. But since all I really wanted was to have all the episodes on DVD I went ahead and ordered the cheaper set. When I received it today, I read the back and toward the end of the top paragraph it said:

""Celebrate the show that explores the day-to-day - and night-to-night, world of single women in this, the definitive collector's edition.

With that read, I wanted to see if I really got the ""Collector's Edition"" so I called my girlfriend who bought her ""Collector's Edition"" at the regular price of $300 back a few years ago to compare the difference. Good news! Sounds like they're the exact same thing! What I received in my $109.99 set is a pink velvet spiral binder with various color pictures of the ladies and scenes from the show and short summaries of each episode. The DVDs are nicely tucked away, by seasons, in pockets of thicker pages after the summaries. The pink velvet spiral binder comes in a plastic sleeve for protection from scratches, etc. There's no way, however, to see if this DVD set was made in 2007. Everywhere I looked said 2005. Oh well, I'll be happy if all the DVDs work!

If you want to peek at what this set looks like I suggest clicking on the ""Collector's Edition"" for $196.99 and looking at Picture 4 of 9. It's the picture with the binder (closed and open) with the DVDs nicely scattered in front of it. That is exactly what I received today.

Happy shopping and I hope this helps!",1210809600,292,1608,4.5344827586206895

At first, I thought it was because the DVD player she has is older, but after trying the discs in three others, none of them play correctly.

  It has taken me some time to get through the DVDs, and as a result, I have only recently found two of the discs to be defective (one will not play specific episodes, the other simply stops repeatedly in a jumpy fashion and will not allow me to get to the end of the episode). Unfortunately, as a person working normal 9-5 hours, I was unable to watch all the discs early enough to discover the problem discs until the 30 day full-refund period had elapsed.

2392741,1,B000ASDFJU,"Great series but the packaging is sub-standard and many of the DVDs are scratched and scuffed, even when the product is bought new.  The DVDs are housed in cardboard sleeves and it is very apparent that this is causing the scuffing and damage.  Just as many others have complain, my entire season 3 is damaged to the point that it won't play on any DVD player.  HBO should be ashamed of themselves and should provide replacements for the damaged discs.  However, I have not had any success in getting a replacement.

I would highly recommend avoiding this product, especially when you can purchase the seasons individually at a lower overall price.  If you do buy it, remove all discs as soon as you receive them and place them in a ""real"" CD case with padded sleeves to prevent further damage.",1204588800,6,794,4.635714285714286
2392742,4,B000ASDFJU,"First off, the packaging is gorgeous! The bright velvety pink book format is unique and ingenious. I love that it comes with a hard plastic case to keep it protected. As I said, it is in book format, which takes you page by page through the 6 seasons of the show. The layout is nice.

What I wish they would have done was redesigned the dvds. If you buy the show season by season, the dvds have the main menu, then (I'm going on memory so bear with me!) the next menu has the episodes that are on that particular dvd. Once you select an episode, it takes you to yet another menu where you can preview/play the episode. It drives me nuts! So when I got this, I hoped there was an option to play all episodes, that way you don't have to hit 450 buttons to watch the dvd. I think they could have eliminated at least 1 or 2 of the extra menus.  This is the reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5.

Another thing I wish they would have changed would have been the talking on the menus. You know how if you leave a dvd on it's menu the music will play over and over again? Well, this has lines from each show, playing over and over and over. It's just a small annoyance. Thankfully there's a mute button for those times when you're not quite ready to start the show.

Overall, this is a great buy for the die hard Sex fans out there. I was lucky enough to receive it as a gift and I love it! If you love the show, it really pays to own the dvds. The reruns that are editted on tv are just not the same.",1203465600,,1496,3.9766666666666666
2392743,1,B000ASDFJU,"as some reviews mentioned, the price is not cheap

i heard a lot about how wonderful this show is/was and decided to get the whole package - expecting to enjoy it

first, the delivery was delayed due to whatever reason, but i am appreciative to receive it in the end

when i played the first DVD from season 1 ep 1-3 was great, i enjoyed the show

however from season 1 ep4-6 onwards, DVD has problems, making the viewing unpleasant

i have not played all the DVDs but expect more DVD to be faulty

for close to $200, HBO is providing very bad quality",1203120000,7,551,4.25
2392744,3,B000ASDFJU,"I am not rating the show since I've only seen parts of some episodes.  But I suspect the 4-star average given this product by all reviewers is strongly based on the show content, not the product itself.

My 3-star rating (generous) is solely based on the product (lack of) quality.  After two tries, I asked Amazon for a refund.

Many of the discs were heavily scratched, dented, or had a film on them.  Be sure to examine each disc in good light before your return period is up.

The picture quality (4:3 format by the way) is marginal...how did they recorded this stuff anyway?  It does improve somewhat in the latter seasons.  Also note you can't play the whole season automatically; you must go back to a menu to start each episode.  This will be inconvenient for those of you who want to continually play this series in the ""background"" instead of music or radio, as my daughter does with Friends.

The plastic case was fine in both sets but the case is very hard and sharp.  We liked the velvety texture of the book but the degree of ""velvetiness"" varied between the two sets.

The discs fit into slots cut into the paper pages and sorted by season.  These pages will most likely tear with repeated use.  You can't replace a torn page without taking the whole book apart; it has a spiral binder...not 3-ringed.

Given the amount of discounting on this box set and the individual seasons at times, HBO must be making a ton of money on the series.  Watch for sales...I've seen the boxed set available for under $100 and the individual seasons for under $10 each (but a store might not have all the seasons at one time).  At those prices, HBO will NOT be improving the quality of this almost ""disposible"" DVD series.",1202947200,6,1719,4.511326860841424

2392746,4,B000ASDFJU,"It took me a while to actually get into the show, because the first season was the weakest I thought. I never liked the individual one on one with the camera type acting. Thankfully that changed in season 2. And the show got more interesting. I know Sarah Jessica Parker is the star of the show, but I thought her to be the most annoying character. She really isn't a likeable character. Miranda is a close second. Samantha is my favorite but that is because Kim Cattrall really pulls it off in the acting department. Anyway, every character has flaws and weaknesses. Carrie's is Mr. Big, who is actually a favorite character of mine. When he appears on screen I already know the episode is going to be a good one. Now, I don't for one moment believe that any of this is truly realistic. I mean, half the situations the girls find themselves in is ridiculous. And no way can Carrie afford to live where she lives and be able to buy all those shoes and outfits, with her 'job'. Also, I'm still amazed by how much sex these girls really have. Its really eye opening. Again, unrealstic, but it is just a show after all. The good outweighs the bad, etc. I can't wait to see what they're going to do with the movie.",1202256000,,1210,4.3584070796460175
2392747,5,B000ASDFJU,"Sex and the City is by far the best television show ever made. Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Catrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis are the perfect group of girlfriends, and the show would not be the same without any one of them. I've been watching this show for years, and can STILL watch it over and over. I am just as addicted now as I was in the beginning! This show has it all - wit, humor, sexiness, tears... and each episode is completely relateable!

This Complete Series Collector's Giftset is awesome! Not only is it great looking, but it beats the original individual packaging by far! I'm not sure why those were packaged the way they were, but they fall apart. Even I, keeping everything I own in prestine condition, could not keep them from breaking at each fold.

Hubby got this set for me for this past Christmas and I LOVE it.  I don't understand the earlier whining here about them coming out with a full set of the whole series after people bought them individually; they almost ALWAYS come out with these kinds of sets when a series ends.  You can't be stupid enough to not KNOW that so either have the patience to wait or quit whining; it's a pointless and silly reason to rate this item so low.  Sell the individual seasons on eBay or elsewhere and buy this one if you are envious.  This series still sells quite well. And if someone has never seen the box these come in, then assuming it's a regular sized DVD box, to contain an entire 6+ seasons worth of DVDs is just ridiculous!  Quit the whining!!!  It's a GREAT set and I would assume the reason for buying it is to WATCH THE SHOW from time to time; not to show off expensive packaging!

I had wanted to get it long before now for myself, but just couldn't justify spending the three hundred dollars for it. So, instead, I bought each individual disc as it came out, but I wanted this set so badly.  It was a complete surprise this year!  But what's not a surprise is that this gift set is everything promised and more...

The design and presentation of this item is just superb.  It comes in a plexiglass box that keeps all of your DVDs from each season safe.  Plus it has tons of extras, some of which include:

En-Sex-Lopedia - All-encompassing guide to Sex and the City that takes a look back at the defining moments in dating, fashion, friendship and relationships.

Location, Location, Location! - A guide to New York restaurants, clubs and boutiques frequented by Carrie and  her friends.

Sex Essentials - A video jukebox for advice, quips and quotes on dating, sex, fashion and more!

You Can Quote Me on It - A ""finish that phrase"" game that tests your knowledge of the famous quotes uttered throughout the seasons! So much fun!

The Guest List - A look back at some of the famous faces making memorable guest appearances on the show.

Also these are kept in a binder type book which looks gorgeous on the coffee table.  I also have ""Kiss and Tell"" with the pink faux alligator cover thats a perfect match to display together. Everyone that comes over is so impressed with how much went into this gift set.

This was and always will be one of my very favorite shows.  And, if it's one of yours, you are guaranteed to love this set.  You can put in any disc at any time and it's a night out with the girls every night of the week.  It includes all six seasons and every single episode plus other commentary as well.  I will never part with this set.  It's a staple in my television time.  That's quite a lot considering I don't watch that much T.V., but I find this show and this set to be totally worth it! I can't say it enough...I LOVE THIS SET!!

Yes, I agree with other reviews that the box set is large and doesn't fit with the rest of my DVD's...OF COURSE IT IS!! It's holding 20 DVD's...it's going to be a large case! DUH!So that's absolutely nothing to complain about in my opinion.
I've noticed no scratches on any of my discs and my case was not cracked or damaged when I received it. Amazon had it packed in a cardboard case within the delivery box, so it shipped safely. I am definitely a satisfied customer.
This is one of my favorite shows and I'm looking forward to hosting many Sex & the City Party Nights!",1197590400,,780,4.386206896551724
2392768,1,B000ASDFJU,"I know that this sounds like a great purchase, and it would be, but 9 times out of ten, the one you recieve will be broken.  Just look at these reviews...the first account of a defective set was from January, 2006!  And that's almost what all reviews report onward.  That's almost 2 years!!!  I called HBO to see if there were lot numbers to avoid, but they told me they had no list of defective lot numbers published.  It's a shame they haven't issued a recall.  I took a chance and purchased this set from amazon two weeks ago, and sure enough...it was defective.  Some episodes just don't play at all.  Just to clairify, this problem is not limited to Amazon's copies; just check others websites too!  Let's face it...do you really want to spend almost $200.00 dollars on something you'll probably just end up returning.  The only way you can know if your set is defective is to watch EVERY EPISODE to see, and you have to do that within the 30 day return policy.  It will take forever.  Speaking of returns... when I discovered my set was broken, I immediatley called amazon on the phone and spoke to an indian woman who gaurenteed me a FULL refund since defective products are considered Amazon's error.  She emailed me a prepaid shipping label, and I put the package in a UPS box.  Three days later, I recieve an email saying the reason for return was: ""customer ordered wrong item""  WHAT?!  and there's more: from the refund, they charged me for the ""prepaid shipping"", and a $99.00 restocking fee!! I only got refunded for half of what I paid for it!  I immediately called Amazon and thankfully got it sorted out immediately.  BOTTOM LINE:  Save money, fear, and time by buying each season individually which is what I ended up doing.  I know it isn't as convenient as having the show in one box, but when it comes down to it, what are you buying it for: to watch the series, or to look at the box?",1196899200,27,1906,4.453757225433526
2392769,5,B000ASDFJU,"First off I love the show...so a thousand stars for that... now on to the actual item. The only complaint I have is that I had to return it twice. Not because of scratched disks like everyone has been saying, all the disks work wonderfully, but because the hard case was cracked. Amazon's shipping has been incredibly lackluster as of late and I get more damaged goods than usable ones.... anyway...

It is a lovely set. Don't listen to people that complain about being ""milked"" because they had to buy this set after they bought all the seasons...If you don't want to be ""milked"" buy the edition that will make you happy, even if it means waiting for it! I hate reviews like this because they don't contribute anything. More importantly it isn't about the studios ""milking"" anyone! They are a business... and one should expect by now that when a DVD comes out, if you want a more ""definitive"" edition... WAIT! I never buy DVDs I'm really interested in until they've had a few new editions. I save money and I get all the features that I want. It takes patience, not even brilliance, to figure out that you should only buy what you want.

Next-ly... I find it incredibly wrong that Amazon is letting people post pictures of the ""International"" edition. It's bootleg. Illegal bootleg (if you can't tell by the misspelling ie ""Editiong"" among others...) I received the illegal bootleg as a gift (by accident, the person didn't know any better...we got our money back by fighting for it). The disks might as well be coasters. The ones that do work look like they are from a video camera taping a TV. I know this might make bootleggers angry since I am telling you all the big secret... but basically for something like this it really is better to just buy the real thing (the set or even the separate seasons) It will save you the heartache of throwing $100+ down the drain.

Bottom line, great show, great set, don't let people rip you off. :-)",1195862400,,1942,4.558739255014327

HBO has basically put out an incredibly shoddy product. Even if you love Sex and the City, DO NOT buy this set! You will regret it. Hopefully, HBO will have the good sense to issue a recall one of these days. In the meantime, I'm considering never buying an HBO product again.",1194652800,10,562,4.212962962962963

Thinking this was an isolated incident, I returned it and got a replacement set. My replacement set had the same problem. There must have been something wrong with this print run.

Also, I believe there's only one bonus feature on this set that's not on mine, and that was not worth the significant price difference.  In fact, I think there are one or two bonus features on the individual DVDs that aren't included in this set.  I just couldn't bear to give anything ""Sex and the City"" anything less than five stars.  Let's just hope the forthcoming movie lives up to this brilliant series.",1193788800,,589,4.457943925233645

2392776,5,B000ASDFJU,"This review is for all you Sex and the City fans who are thinking about buying this but are affraid to because of reviews about troublsome disks...

I my self am a huge fan and love the idea of a complete collectors set but I was afraid to purchase this because of all the negative reviews about the sets DVDs that would skip or just not play at all.  There's nothing like spending $200.00+ on something that doesn't work.

Well finally my need for hanging with ""the girls"" won out and I purchased the set just in time for the long Labor Day weekend.  I settled in for a ""Sex and the City"" marathon and watched all six seasons.  I am happy to say, there were NO problems what so ever!!!  Even with season 3, which had gotten a lot of complaints in other reviews.  Everything was crystal clear and the bonus disks are even great too!!!

The only thing that's a little dissapointing is that there are no episodes with a comentary option until season 3.  I thought for sure they would offer commentations on the first episode at least...

Other than that it's a beautiful set and now I can meet ""the girls"" in the coffee shop for fun and laughs anytime!",1189814400,10,1150,4.331775700934579
2392777,2,B000ASDFJU,"I have been waiting for this and finally received it.  Ok but I am on my replacement set that ALSO won't play.  I am frustrated and disappointed.  So now what, do I buy each season individually???!",1189728000,4,197,4.416666666666667
2392778,5,B000ASDFJU,"This attractive box set is great for keeping all of the Sex and the City DVDs together and organized in one place.  Before I got this set, I had all of the individual seasons on seperate dvd's which took up a lot of space and wasn't very convenient for taking to parties or lending out.  The art in this collection is also great, with pictures of all of the actresses and blurbs and quotes from each episode.  This is very helpful when you're looking for that one particular episode that you want to watch!",1189468800,,506,4.361702127659575
2392779,4,B000ASDFJU,"After two years of wanting this DVD set more than I wanted anything else, I finally have it.  And, after finally having it, I spent nearly 50 hours watching every single episode back to back to back.  I barely left my room, I barely talked to my friends, and I loved it.

There are some definite drawbacks to the set, it's true.  However, unlike many here, I actually didn't have a problem with the packaging.  I admit that the height is a bit of a problem, because even though my shelves are extra-large, it doesn't fit in with the rest of my DVDs.  That's actually okay by me, because it just means that they'll get a place of honor all their own on another shelf.  And I don't mind that they're in cardboard slots in a binder.  It's good quality, stiff cardboard and there's no reason it won't last as long as you're taking care of your set.  The main issue I have with packaging is that the set comes in a plastic case that actually broke during transit, so that I no longer have anything to keep the dust off the velvet cover.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I'm not sending the whole set back just for a broken case that may well break again when they send me another one.

The reason I bought this set is because of the television show, which I adore.  I never thought I could forget how great this show was, but apparently I did, because watching it all together like I did really made me see it with new eyes.  I found myself looking at it from a completely different perspective, especially now that I have two years of my own experience to add to it.  I was surprised, for instance, by how much I dislike Carrie Bradshaw now, as a character.  When I watched the show season by season, she just seemed like a fun, flawed character.  But once I saw how screwed up she really was as a person, most of my sympathy for her went right out the window.  Luckily, as the seasons went on, it became clearer and clearer that she wasn't the main reason to watch.  She didn't evolve or change as a character at all, but everyone around her did.  And maybe that was the point.

Unfortunately, I'll never know for sure if that was the point or not, due to the laziness in putting this ""Collector's Giftset"" together.  The extras compiled here are definitely the most pathetic extras I've ever seen.  There are some silly and poorly constructed games (The one where you choose which SATC man you're most compatible with doesn't even make any sense.  Play it and see.), some thoroughly pointless and badly edited clip packages and a bunch of other extras that might have been useful *IF* anyone had actually put some thought into them.

For instance, there's a guide to all the men the women dated on each episode.  But they don't give the name of the actor, in case you want to look him up.  And when they tell you what disc to put in to watch that episode, they do it numerically: ""Insert Disc 11"", etc..  However, the discs aren't actually numbered that way, so you'd have to sit there and count every disc in order to figure out which one was the right one.  They DO give the names of all actors who play the main men, but that's nothing you can't easily find on IMDb, so that's a cop-out.

Also, the discs themselves have been re-printed with new pictures on the outside, but they have the same exact layout and content as the discs from the individual seasons.  It's a cheap and lazy ploy, and it's outrageous that for $200, HBO couldn't be bothered to get the main actors, writers and producers into a studio to record some fresh commentary tracks.  I've already heard all these commentary tracks, so none of this is new.  It's outrageous, but it's not surprising.  HBO has a long history of gouging people for as much money as they can in exchange for as little content as they can get away with, so it's buyer beware, at all times.

Yet, in spite of all this, I still think the show is amazing, and I'm still so thrilled to finally have it all at my fingertips that I'm willing to overlook just about anything.  After all, I didn't buy this for the extras.  And neither should anyone else.  If you already own every other season, throw out your cheap plastic packaging and invest in a nice CD wallet to hold your discs, but don't throw out all the discs just to buy this set.  It's not worth it.  (And if you only own a few seasons and are looking to this to complete your collection, you're better off just buying the ones you're missing on their own.  Trust me.)  However, if you don't own ANY of the discs, then by all means, invest.  I can't think of a better way to spend $200 and 47 hours.",1189209600,9,4591,4.332942555685815
2392780,1,B000ASDFJU,"Its been said before.  And like the others, I don't blame Amazon.  They did everything they could, sent a new (but defective) set over night air.  Refunded my money when neither played, and I was well past the 30 day period.

2392783,1,B000ASDFJU,"Amazon is currently selling each of these seasons individually for $20.00 each, give or take some pennies.  That's $140.00 for all seven packages.

And that Amazon.com will STOP DOING THIS, as this is the third time I've caught them inflating the price of a DVD collection when they come cheaper on their own.",1188172800,11,1044,5.887417218543046
2392784,3,B000ASDFJU,"Product is good, but can get it cheaper elsewhere.  I returned it and bought it at a big discount store.  This is one of the few times I didn't get a better deal at Amazon.",1187827200,,172,3.8857142857142857
2392785,5,B000ASDFJU,"""Later that day I got to thinking about relationships. There are those that open you up to something new and exotic, those that are old and familar, those that bring up lots of questions, those that bring you somewhere unexpected, those that bring you far from where you started, and those that bring you back* (*punctuated with the sound of Samantha c*ming)"". But the most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you find someone to love the 'you', you love...well thats just fabulous!""

With that very last voice-over, I watched TV character, Carrie Bradshaw peer down at her cell phone, giggle, and disappear down Fifth Avenue wearing her Manolo Blahniks and carrying a Fendi bag in hand. I had just spent almost once a week, for the past twenty-some months, watching all 94 episodes of ""Sex and the City-The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)"". And you know what? It was all...so worth it!

Each week I would find some alone time for just a half hour, with no other worldly distractions, so I could follow the social/sexual adventures of four smart, sophisticated, stylishly dressed women (all friends) as they hilariously made their way through the trendy, concrete dating jungle of Manhattan. These four women included sex columnist and shoe fanatic, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), preppy, idealistic, art dealer, Charlotte York (Kristin Davis), cynical lawyer Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon) and finally PR spin-meister and sexual adventurer, Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall).

In the early episodes of the series it seems like we are being treated to an almost comic anthropological study of men, women, dating and sex. Carrie would pose a question on the Mac for her column and their adventures would come up with the answers. But as the series goes on, we watch the changes in these characters as they emotionally grow and evolve. We get to experience with them, both the highs and lows of their lives. This includes boyfriends, marriages, a birth, sickness and all the other messy stuff that comes along. And through all this, these four friends wittily comment (in sometimes hilariously graphic language), laugh and cry as they get together. In the end these women always have each other for support. They are always there for each other. It's what friendship is all about. And that I think is why this show went from merely being just a well written, well acted comedy to becoming something really special for both its' fans and TV history.

This 20-disc ""Complete Collectors Set"" is much more covenient (and cheaper) then buying the individual seasons. The pink, furry, book-like, packaging includes sepia toned photos of the cast and brief descriptions of each episode. The seasons are color coded for easy identification. The only packaging drawback is that the cardboard pockets can easily scratch the discs. (My anwer to this is to keep the current disc you're using in a spare CD jewel case.) The extras include two HBO tributes to the show, a taping of a lively (and funny!) writers forum and a small amount of deleted scenes, season by season. Best of all are the episode commentary tracks from Writer/Director Michael Patrick King. His commentary is both interesting and incisive, giving both detailed analysis of each episode's themes plus all the great poop about the behind the scenes stuff! They were a pleasure to listen to.

So, here it is, twenty-some months from when I first started watching ""Sex and the City-The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)"". What is there to do now? Why start all over course! I'm sure the ride will be just as fun...",1186704000,2,3644,4.9868421052631575
2392786,5,B000ASDFJU,"So I bought this set for my girlfriend. At the time the price on Amazon was a little less (about $10) than the stores around Boston. The outside is fuzzy (like suede), and the design is very clever. The show itself I started watching with my girlfriend. I think it is a very funny show.
At one point, I had been outted by my loving girlfriend that I had been watching the show ... Sometimes without her. After getting teased for a good while one other guy let a Sex in the City quote slip (He had been watching the show too it seemed.) Then all the rest of the guys confessed that they watch the show too. It was beginning to feel like a support meeting.
My point is, even though you will not find ""the guys"" getting together for a Sex in the City marathon and a gallon of ice cream - the show is entertaining to guys too. My advice guys - make up an excuse (buying it for my sister, girlfriend, or it's for a project at work.) and hide the pink folder thing in the drawer, watch the show, but not in a bubble bath.",1186531200,2,1015,4.08

2392802,3,B000ASDFJU,"I bought this set for my girlfriend and somehow ended up getting completely enraptured by the show while watching it with her.  The first season or two are shaky, but soon enough the writers demonstrate an uncanny ability to perfectly blend romance, drama, and plenty of wry humor, as well as using the ordinary as a springboard for analyses about life and social behaviors amongst people via Carrie's musings.  I have truly come to care about many of the characters in this show (although Steve is my personal favorite).

However, I'm only giving this set three stars because multiple DVDs in the set are prone to produce pixelation on the screen as well as skipping and freezing.  We weren't even able to play some of the episodes.  At first I thought it was just a defective set, so I purchased another, but this one suffered from the same issues.  Amazon notes that this may occur on older DVD players, but our player was purchased within the last year.

I don't know if the same issues arise in the individual sets, but I feel this demonstrates low regard for the series on the part of HBO, and I plan on contacting them about it through their website and suggesting they issue a recall or offer a free replacment program.",1178582400,10,1227,4.60091743119266

All the disks come in a sort of diary kind of presentation, with all the episodes taglines and reviews, plus amazing extras. The pink velvety cover has embeded the sillouette of New York City and the title, and it looks ohhhh so Carrie-like... and on top of that, the book comes inside of an acrilic crystal-like box, that makes it look just like a jewel.

If so, somebody ought to tell the Donald because he's missing the boat too), but they all have excellent, well-paying jobs.  The only two things I ever thought were unrealistic were: 1) being a lawyer myself, how often Miranda seems to be free to have a social life; and 2) how does Carrie walk down New York City streets in those shoes?

The insights into the four women's lives, as well as those of the minor characters, is penetrating and accurate.  I was never crazy about Samantha; I found her rather one-dimensional and much too focused on sex and only sex, sort of a one-note person.  But as the seasons progressed, particularly the final season, she became much more real; the cancer problem turned her into a real person.  And Smith Jarred!  What a hunk!

The only thing is at least 3 of the episodes skip a lot and are impossible to watch, and I'm on season three.  Great bargain though, awesome show.",1150070400,,275,4.352941176470588
2392889,5,B000ASDFJU,"This show is about the sexual and romantic escapades of four depraved New York women.  If one were to compile a list of those shows, movies, works of fiction, that best combined great entertainment with unsavory protagonists, the top spots would have to include ""In Cold Blood"" (murderers), ""Lolita"" (child molester), and ""Sex and the City"" (the basest, coarsest, most objectionable and trivial kind of American female).  One suspects, however, that only in this last case, is the audience somehow intended to like and admire the characters.

This characterization applies principally to Carrie, an awful, awful, whiny, self-absorbed, horse-faced, shoe-hungry madwoman (very well acted by SJP); the other three have some redeeming qualities:  Miranda is a smart, cynical, attractive woman and the transcendently shallow Charlotte is mostly harmless.  Curiously, the most lascivious of the four, Samantha (brilliantly acted by Kim Cattrall), is also the most likable and respectable.

One can question whether or not there really are many women like these ones (and, if so, how best to avoid them...), but there is a more interesting way in which the show rings false.  This is the portrayal of the male characters' attitudes towards such females:  they seem indifferent to such free and easy feminine behavior, whereas in truth most men are instinctively repelled by it (except of course in women they see solely as sexual objects).  The show has a number of fundamentally good male characters, most notably Mr. Big, Carrie's on-again-off-again boyfriend.  Big is a great guy, but his single unfathomable, unrealistic trait is his serious interest in such a horrid, grasping woman as Carrie.  One  repeatedly wants to shout at him ""Run away!  Far far away!""; occasionally Big takes the advice, only to come back for more.

Carrie is, surprise, surprise, a newspaper sex columnist, and the show's favorite organizational principle is to have her, near the beginning, ruminate about sex for a bit, utter some banal rhetorical question like ""Are we all repressed hermaphrodites in search of Platonic love?"", and then illustrate its relevance to each woman's life over the course of the show.  I know that sounds trite and unwatchable, but in the details it can be immensely entertaining.  The writing is wonderfully crisp, often funny, occasionally clever, and never artistic.  Most importantly the viewer isn't bored.  Perhaps its greatest strength (like Seinfeld's) is a refreshing and unashamed commitment to triviality; occasionally it forgets this and assumes a false gravity that doesn't fit (e.g. death of a character's mother), but this is the exception, not the rule.  Overall it's very good stuff and highly recommended.  Does it mark the decline of western civilization?  I don't know, but if I have any daughters, I'm moving to freaking Saudi Arabia.",1149379200,9,2859,5.280973451327434
2392890,2,B000ASDFJU,"I bought the set for my wife. We both think the show is great. But I was not happy with the paper/cardbord inserts and packaging.

Some of the disks were scratched.",1149292800,15,328,4.046153846153846
2392891,5,B000ASDFJU,"I didn't watch this one when it was showing on HBO.  My hesitation in buying this one was that I have never been a fan of anything that is overly explicit and I'm not a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker.  I have always thought that Kim Cattrail was absolultely beautiful, but to be honest, I could have done without seeing her naked.

The Tributes on the dvd seem to indicate that this was an ""original"" series.  The only really original thing about it was the explicit nature.  I would classify it as a very adult version of FRIENDS. I found it very hard to buy that the characters were 30. With the exception of Charlotte, they looked 40.

It took me until the third season to warm to the series.

Carrie couldn't make up her mind whether to dress in very interesting and classy clothes or to wear things that didn't match at all.  Some of her clothes were just plain tacky!

She wore too many colors together that didn't match and the see through clothes with colored bras and male briefs were, to use their words, ""ICK."" Someone also needs to clue Sarah Jessica into the fact that she looks much better with the straight, shorter hair and not all of those ""skunk"" colors in it.

The only thing that kept this from being porn was the story line. The characters did mesh together well.  They were real inspite of the explicit sex and funky clothes.  I find it hard to believe that ANYONE is that permissive about sex.  I also don't know of anyone who talks that explictly about their sex lives with other people.

On a positive note, I could identify with feeling that you have the right guy, then discovering something about him or the relationship that couldn't be acceptable. Dating becomes harder as you grow older in that we are more discerning about who we date.  We have learned more about who we are and what we want and what we can or can not tolerate.  I could also identify with the feeling that they would NEVER find the right man, much less their soulmate... I myself am still waiting.

Despite my outdated old world values and morals, and my adversion to things that are too explicit, ( I am of the opinion that implied is much sexier than explicit.) this series is worth a watch. If you are of a more modern outlook than I am, chances are that you will really love this series.",1148774400,2,2288,4.396674584323041

Whether or not you already know the cast of characters:

Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte

or missed the series when it aired on HBO

as I did, this DVD can be a wildly entertaining experience

as long as you can get over the fact that ultimately

these ladies are much more promiscuous than the average gal.

What makes it more than soft core pornography

is the inspired writers and clever directors

who together have made this

one of the most successful TV shows in history.

I admire Carrie's, Miranda's, Samantha's and Carlotte's friendship but i don't like their life styles in regards to sleeping with as many men as there are in NYC. C'mon now, they are just fancy drassed easy women, to put it in more appropriate words. Their choice in men is rediculous and their conversations often tend to be a bit juvinille. Carrie spends all of her money on shoes and then fails to come up with a downpayment for her appartment and Samantha sleeps with anything male that can walk. Miranda is too cynical and negative and judgmental. Carlotte is the only likable character because of her belief that love and romance still exist and it's not only about sex.

The real beauty of this show is being able to watch these characters transform from Season 1 to 6, and how flawlessly the writers are able to make these changes, and how the actresses make you belive in these growths.

The sex scenes are not meant to be erotic most of the time.  They, from what I can remember genreally, are played for comedy.

And, might I remind everyone, that the forgien press, and not Americans, chose to award Sex and the City with numerous Golden Globes across the six season span, so more people love this show then just its domestic audience.

Lastly, the fact that these women eat in expensive restruants, wear expensive clothes, and go out every week is not meant to be taken seriously.  The show is not telling viewers: YOU SHOULD LIVE LIKE THIS.  These factors are amplified for artistic purposes, to make the show a heightened reality.  If they didn't go out, and meet new characters, it would be a plotless sitcom.  And, as a minor note, it fits into the diagetic world of the story, being that these women are more on the 'upper class' side.

This show is really just a glorified sitcom, with dirty talk and some very short (and not erotic) sex scenes.  The 4 women are very superficial, and are not very realistic.  Constantly eating out at posh restaurants in Manhattan (there are other burroughs in NYC, such as Queens and Brooklyn, where it is much cheaper to eat) every day, sleeping with a different man each week, buying as many things as they can, partying all hours of the night, and they still find time to work their professional jobs.  These women are supposed to be ""professionals"", but if that were the case, they would never be able to keep up their lifestyles (even with doing Red Bulls and coke all day).  I feel that these women are very unhappy, and they look for fullfilment through a hedonistic lifestyle.  I hark back to the 1960's in the films L'avventura and La Dolce Vita, where this kind of lifestyle was depicted as cheap (spiritually speaking), hollow, shallow, and depressing (and it still is, regardless of what the media may tell you).  Most of their affairs are quite meaningless, it's mostly sex without emotion, and the conversations remind me more of locker room talk written by sitcom writers.  And the sex scenes (which many people told me they were so hot) are tepid at best.  I have seen films by European art filmmakers (Bertolucci and Breillat, to name a few) that are light years more honest and artistic than anything this show can put out.  Americans have very childish attitudes towards sex, almost childlike.  They giggle at dirty talk, and try to show off their ""knowledge"" of sex, like when a 6th grader discovers the sex ed book, and brags about the new dirty words he/she has discovered.  Overall, a very disappointing show.  Do not fool yourselves...",1142467200,9,1902,4.724242424242425

2392918,5,B000ASDFJU,"What can one say about ""Sex and the City"" it was a bold show that took chances and wasn't afraid to be blunt about dating and sex.  Each character as their own individual voice and personality that it makes it such a treat to see all of their different views on situations.  Samantha, the free spirit, who is very much in touch with her sexuality and knows how to use it.  Charlotte, the hopeless romantic who is on a constant search for her prince charming.  Miranda, the slightly cynical one of the group who wonders if there ever truly is a happily ever after.  Carrie, has a bit of all three in her which probably makes her the most relatable one of the four because all of us have a bit of Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda in us.  The show provided a great in depth look on the relationships and friendships between these four women and how dating isn't always the great thing it's made out to be in movies and other tv shows.  It was honest in it's portrayal and how tough it is to date.

  I applaud each of the actresses because with out them and their perfect chemistry together the show wouldn't be the hit that it became.  This DVD set is a real treat for fans of the series, it would have been a great set even if it was just the episodes themselves with no special features.  The bonus disc is a nice touch to the set with games and little video montages of the characters and quotes from the series.  However, my favorite feature is the farewell tribute on the season 6 (part 2) set.  The tribute has all of the actors and creators comment on the show and how it became the huge success it turned out to be.  So for anyone who is debating about getting this set, I say go for it because not only do you get fantastic, quality episodes, you also get a beautiful package for the set filled with photos, episode guide and great bonus features.  Only thing I wish was included were bloopers because I'm sure with a show like Sex and the City, there must have been some terrific bloopers.",1138924800,4,1996,4.2967914438502675

2392924,5,B000ASDFJU,"When Sex & the City first began airing, I wasn't able to watch every single episode, since it was on HBO and played kind of late. Recently, I have been watching the re-runs on the WB and I just got hooked. I received this DVD collection as a gift and I became an S&C junkie! The collection is wonderful with it's beautiful case, bonus dvd's, extras on mostly all discs, commentary, it's great organization strategy, etc. This show may not be a reality show, but there are definitely areas where one can relate. I love how it doesn't focus on negative drama like other shows do. There are no murders to be solved, mysterious neighbors to figure out; it's a light-hearted show that doesn't get you down.

I just can't say enough about this show, except that as I was watching the last couple of episodes, I noticed my eyes were filling with tears. As I wiped my eyes, I knew the end of the series was here. It's a bitter sweet ending... you've followed the lives of these women and know the conclusions of their journey, yet you know there will be no 'seventh season' dvd to begin playing.

This show is awesome and you must own your own collection!",1137715200,2,1147,4.431279620853081
2392925,4,B000ASDFJU,"Many people are understandably angry that this is now out in a new-fangled boxed-set edition and while that IS sort of cheesy on HBO's part, I think the focus should be on the show itself and not the packaging.  I own the original plastic-cased editions as many others do and that's fine because the episodes are all the same.  There may be some slight extras in the new set but really, the episodes are the important thing, no?

Sex and the City was a very addictive show with both relatable and non-relatable story lines and characters.  I think that on some level, if you were a big fan of the show, you found something in each of the women to relate to at some point in time - especially, if like me, you were a single girl in her 30s living in New York City when this show was airing regularly.  I do admit that much of what was portrayed was a bit far-fetched and shallow at times but as a show, it was very funny for what it was and quite entertaining.  The women were a bit self-centered, yes, but they were also compilations of many types of women out there and at least they were each independent and educated.  While many of us could or couldn't relate to, say,  Carrie's clothing and shoe addiction (I have that one) or Samantha's voracious sexuality, for example, the show really was a nice retrospective of what could possibly happen to any one of us or, in some cases, what actually has happened to any one of us, and in other cases, what would likely never happen to any one of us (for instance, having a famous artist sketch and paint your c**t for a gallery exhibit of c**ts, or having your one-night stand leave $1,000 on the nightstand before ditching you).

Personally, I loved that the series was filmed in New York City because it showed the rest of the world just how amazing NYC is.  And also, that it emphasized the friendship aspect of these women over time (considering we've all known women who drop their girlfriends whenever a man shows up).  As unrealistic as it was that these four career women had so much free time to spend with each other, the basic core of their friendship was most important and meaningful and was the heart of what carried the show through all of the seasons.

So, to offer my two cents, I say that if you don't already own the series (or if you are a serious collector), then this is the set for you.  But if you already own the original editions, I would keep them.  They fit on the shelf nicely with all of your other DVDs, they are the same episodes in the same order anyway so why pay all of that money for what you already own.  HBO doesn't need the dough, the girls don't exactly need the royalties and you could probably use it on something else - like cute new shoes or a boxed set of some other series you love and don't already own.",1137542400,4,2799,4.325047801147227

To answer the questions about the tributes and alternate endings, it does include the three alternate endings, but they are pretty disappointing. They are short and not what I was expecting.  The two HBO tributes are also included.  I think all the extras are pretty great.  The box is pretty big and does not fit in most dvd cabinets which is frustrating, but I love the layout and the book.  It would be hard to create a book with the pictures and descriptions and still make it small enough to fit with the other dvds.  It has all of the dvds as well as descriptions of each episode in a book with great pictures.  It makes it fun and easy to skim through, find your favorite epidose and play it.

Still, though, it's a pretty good value for all these episodes, and the series in re-runs just isn't the same because of its censorship.

EVERY movie comes out on DVD.  Then that christmas they come out with the SAME movie but in the criterion collection...AND WE BUY IT.  EVERY series comes out in individual first- THEN comes out in a set.  AND WE BUY IT.  Long live corporate greed & rampant consumerism- if we didn't buy the single ones- they wouldnt make them......

Although I can see where some of the reviewers are put off by certain aspects of the show, for instance the fact that the woman portrayed here are strong minded, sexy in their own ways without always being 'made up'  and speaking frankly as most do in an open minded world amongst friends when men aren't around...especially if you are from some po-dunk, bible thumping backwater town where they teach intelligent design as part of the science class in school..( gotta love non working PTA moms with time on their hands and a head full of Jesus!) That said, and you know who you are and why you shouldn't be allowed to view this show. I usually buy most items off Amazon and find that they have the best price but, in this instance, I found a better price at Costco. $170.00!!! Next best is Amazon though. Long story short and my mindless blog out of the way, buy this collection. Nice packaging, quality box set, and alas a must have for fans and even partial fans who enjoyed the show before but were not loyal weekly watchers. Watching episode by episode on your own timetable rather than HBO's ( for workin' folk like myself who were not available every week) will get you re-hooked right back in. My girlfriend loved it for a present and I suspect most will, exception being if you are friends with the bitter female reviewer below but, her boyfriend is most likely her brother and she is still mad that he took her to the prom!

That's not just a tv series thing either. Movies do it as well. Jurassic park, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc, etc. Box sets are the big thing now.

HBO didn't rip anyone off. I agree about releasing the 6th season in two parts, I was bitter about that myself. But it was on tv the same way. They broke the last season up into two parts.

No man in his right mind would be attracted to these ugly skanky women. also I found the whole series to be quite misogynistic since all the women characters are so wholly negative. Plus it seems that the writer is perhaps making the statement that professional women who focus on their careers are ugly, bitter sex crazed whores, which is what these characters are.

2392948,4,B000ASDFJU,"When I started dating my (now ex) girlfriend, I had never previously seen the phenomenom known as Sex and The City. Little did I know that I was now dating a obsessive fan of the show. Over the 8 monthes we dated I had seen every episode that the series had to offer. From Mr. Big to The Russian. From the elegant and stylish Trey, to the homely but amazing divorce lawyer Harry Goldenplatt (sp?). As much as it pains me to admit, this show did have entertaining value, even for a man.

The way I see it, the series was at its best in it's final season. Thing's were finally starting to fall into place for these four woman. Samantha's bout with cancer was an emotional, yet inspiring moment in the shows history. Over the years, the charachters really developed a nice depth to them that really gave you something to grasp onto.

Though, some of the story lines were a little to extravagant, even for NYC single woman. And the games that these people play in there relationships becomes a little to much to bare at times, especially with some of the endings being very generic and predictable.

Even though the show may be slighty slanted to the sympathy of woman, it still serves a good way to entertain. It's something that both you and your boyfriend/girlfriend can enjoy while cuddling with eachother in front of your TV, as long as you are able to laugh at the ridicoulous hijinks that occur in relationships.

If you havn't seen the show before, I wouldn't go out and buy the whole series until you know if you like the show or not. This isn't the sort of show to take someone else's opinion about. Some people love it and some hate it, and sure, theres the few that are neither impressed or disgusted, but at least watch a few episodes before buying the whole lot.",1131148800,18,1772,4.443076923076923
2392949,3,B000ASDFJU,"Okay, look people...complaining about this coming out and the cost of it is a mute point.  I never really got into this show, but decided to buy this box set because I'm a completest.  Do none of you ever do bargain shopping?  I actually got this for $165 from Best Buy for crying out load--beating every other price out there, including AMAZON...if you want it that bad enough, believe me you'll find a cheap way to get it.

A bad point is the size of the thing, where the heck do you put it?  Use it as a doorstop?  And I really don't think this will be the new marketing strategy for most TV series...think about it...this is a half hour show with a total of 94 episodes..Most full TV series have way more than this, and the drama series of HBO are 45 minutes to an hour long in length---there is no conceivable reason that they would put complete series together for anything but this show, it was (relatively) short in its run, and it was a cultural phenomenon, AND HBO knows there are enought die hards who will buy it over an over again.",1131148800,4,1044,4.301020408163265
2392950,3,B000ASDFJU,"Let me just start out by saying that I love Sex and The City. LOVE IT. However, I am so disappointed with the new set. I waited to have this one and am not thrilled with cheap cardboard slots that the precious discs are stored in. With repeated ins and outs, they will get scratched and no matter how careful you are, it will be inevitable. And the PAPER?? Come on!!! There is alot of good stuff, but overall, I wish I'd gotten the other one a month ago and had all this time to enjoy it.",1131062400,11,488,4.041237113402062
2392951,5,B000ASDFJU,"This show surprised me with its wit, its heart, its intelligence and its humor.  I didn't want to like it (too popular!) but I fell in love with it anyway when it finally came to syndicated television.  The four female characters are by turns glamorous, imperfect and neurotically, lovably real in their own individual ways, but it is Sarah JP's Carrie -- a writer with an improbable weakness for stilettos and dresses that cost a month's rent -- who is clearly the heart and soul of the show.  Much of the insight into personalities and problems (oy, there are so many problems!) comes naturally through her eyes and rarely, if ever, feels forced.  No small thing for a TV show.  Though she is the least conventionally good looking of any of the four friends, she is in many ways the most effervescent and irresistible.  Her honesty, her deep hunger for meaning, beauty and fulfillment, her smarts and her belief in herself and (even more so) her best girlfriends make this character one for the ages.  To simply call this show ""smart"" or ""sexy"" or even to say that it ""captures the zeitgeist"" is simply to do it a disservice.  It is a nuanced, heart-on-the-sleeve valentine to the real romance of life, friendship and the not-always-successful pursuit of happiness.  The victory isn't always in the getting, but more often in the trying.  Somehow the people who made this terrific show got that, and didn't forget it.

That the entire enchilada is now being served up in a delicious, raspberry pink boxed set is only fitting.  Style for the stylish, but much more than mere ""pretty"" beats beneath the sueded finish of this attractive package.  Sex and the City showed that there is still room in television for smart writing, original thinking, and characters with genuine, human vulnerabilities beneath their streetwise, world weary ways.

The packaging is only just the beginning ...",1130889600,8,1887,4.85625

I have a solution however, I went to a local flea market where they sell used DVDs, the people there offered me $15 for each season.  It is about half what I paid for them new, but that is $115 towards the new one.  If you can find a place to sell your old DVDs do it!!!

This box set is unbelieveable and I am so happy I got it, it is a lot bigger than I thought and it has so much fun stuff inside it.  I give it 5 + stars!!!",1130803200,8,626,3.6074074074074076
2392953,1,B000ASDFJU,"What the description for this box set doesn't tell you is that it is half again as tall and half again as wide as a standard DVD, so it won't even fit on the same shelf as the rest of your DVDs.  And as nice as the suede album cover might look, inside it's just a ring binder with cheap cardboard DVD holders. Definitely not the high quality boxed set I was looking forward to.  And I really was looking forward to having a decent box set of Sex and the City, since the individual season DVDs had such flimsy plastic cases (very prone to ripping at the edges if you open them at all frequently).

Now I'm kicking myself for having sold my individual DVDs to buy this boxed set.  Maybe in another few years they'll come out with a box set in which they do *not* skimp on the packaging.

The original product contains flimsy cases made of plastic, all but one of mine are in pieces from use, I plan on trying to make my own case for the show.

  For the people who have the money or haven't invested in the show yet, I think this is a great set and wonderful value.  I only wish I could have waited to see the show in retrospect.

Are the following things included in this set:

Three never-before-seen alternate endings to series finale

Two farewell tributes (30 mins. each)

Thanx for all your answers! :)

Btw, I gave this a strong 4 (leaning towards 5), simply cause I don't know if these features I mentioned above are in the set or not. In addition, when I got season six as a present I was, among other things, looking so much forward to the alternate endings and the tributes and found terrible fact about European Edition - nothing!

Well, if I still don't totally understand their lives, I can sure cheer them on or empathize whatever the case may be.  Everyone goes through the ups and downs of dating, choosing to have children, choosing to have a career even if all our choices are different.

If I was judging this DVD set solely based on its design, content, and value, I'd have to give it five stars. The elegant suede photo album packaging and the extra bonus DVD are fabulous, and the cost is a real bargain...the entire ""Sex and the City"" series for under $200? You can't beat that, especially when you look at the way HBO jacks up the prices on its other TV DVD sets.

However, I'm very bitter right now, which is why I'm only giving this item one star. I bought all the original ""Sex and the City"" DVDs when they first came out. The plastic packaging of the single-season DVD sets is unbelievably shabby...the covers are extremely flimsy and I have Scotch tape holding several of my DVD sets together. Also, I paid the full price for each DVD set, which averaged out to about $40 a pop. (It looks like the price of the old sets has since been lowered, at least on Amazon's site.) Plus, HBO screwed its fans by releasing the fifth and final season of the show in two parts, so we had to shell out even MORE money. Now they're coming out with this gorgeous collector's set a year later, and it's such a bargain, which makes me very ANGRY! Why the hell did I shell out all that money to begin with? I'll tell you why: because I love ""Sex and the City"" and I was willing to put up with the crappy plastic packaging just so I could watch my show whenever I felt like it. There is NO WAY I'm shelling out another $200, even though I want this gift set SO BADLY! ARRGH!

I mean, I absolutely love it when Charlotte, Carrie, Samantha, and Mirannda dress up, (especially Carrie and Samantha) in their Gucci, Prada, and their high-heeled ""Screw me"" shoes, visiting all of the expensive restaurants in New York City.

I love it when these four girlfriends meet for a day of shopping, sip Pink Cosmos and encounter striking men.

In reality, we would call women who sleep around sluts, but somehow when these four women do it--it seems, well, alright, cool, and exhilarating in some way. And with no consequence, really.

It explored women's desires, needs, modern lives and relationships in a way that had not been tackled before. It almost certainly paved the way for series such as ""Despearte Housewives"" and even caused some film genre revision, have you not noticed the increased amount of movies which are now cheifly promoted on the strength of talent of the leading Lady?.

 Parker is astute, perky, obessesive and sweet as Carrie, Davies is elegantly uptight as Charloote, Nixon is ballsy, brittle and engagingly hard nosed as Miranda while Cattrall is all guns blazingly ferocious in her approach to life as Samantha.

 The men filter in and out and are scrutinised for their worth, prowess and personality in a direct reverse of standard gender roles in TV shows. Some seasons stand out as better than others, Season 5 is criminally short due to Parker's real life pregnancy having to be disguised and the story lines featuring Birishnakov are worthy but he is no actor! The final season which heads inevitably to the end of our time with these fabulous women, is strangely saddening and ethereal at times, notable is the absence of the standard narration by Parker which for me enhances the haunting quality of this final journey. Also Carrie's attempt to live in Paris feels oddly cold and isolating as this great but sometimes pompous city can be in a way that New York would never be, being as crazy and all embracing as it is.

 In all a worthy series presided over by 4 very beautiful, interesting and talented actors, I miss them heaps!",1119225600,3,1628,4.775800711743773
2392992,5,B000ASDFJU,"""Sex and the City"" is the antidote for those who are sick and tired of seeing endless movies and television shows that have been portraying single people as depressed, sad sack losers who are self-indulgent with too much time on their hands. Sure, Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha can be very vain and self-absorbed at times, but they are overly optimistic and hopeful and don't pertain to the machismo of masculinity. Hence their lunch time is always consist of a giddiness of a school girl gossip, regardless of the hardships that they are undergoing during that particular time, instead of the endless moaning and groaning that single people should be doing according to the other works of medium. The series finale is predictable and a little commercialistic and perhaps too sugary, but it stays true to the roots of this unique and refreshing show: who needs the Russian in beautiful Paris when your gals are always there in New York. In other words, men can be fodder for the continuity of women's friendship and loyalty to one another. This is a brave show that not only tackles a lot of subject matters that are considered taboos even for today's standards, and that also puts back sass into primetime sitcom entertainment, but it presents the embodiment of what a single girl truly is. For those who are adamant about seeing their very first episode (like I was in the beginning), please proceed because underneath the layers of sex and conversations about genital parts over coffee and Samantha's weekly rendezvous with different guys and its overall seemingly superficiality of lipstick gloss and well-coiffed hair, it celebrates girl power, feminism, and friendship and most importantly the knowledge that every girl, single or married, should always have a gay confidante. Besides, who can actually resist looking at the continuing parade of fashion brilliance and fashion faux pas on every episode?",1115596800,6,1919,5.075949367088608

2392994,5,B000ASDFJU,"What can you say about such a hugely popular series, which also happens to be the best series ever? Usually popularity does not guarantee quality, quite the contrary. But in this case, for once, the masses got it right. This little series, taken from the book about single New York girls, introduced us to our  sweetheart sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw,  and her close knit group of girlfriends. Samantha, the good hearted  slut, Charlotte, the relative priss, and Miranda, the successful attorney with her defenses always up to avoid real intimacy/hurt. Their trials and tribulations in their liberated pursuit for love in The City had people hooked from the very beginning. But, who would have known that it would have become quite possibly the best show in t.v. history? Breaking taboos, with strong women no less, just hadn't happened until ""Sex."" To say they pushed the envelope is an understatement. What put this groundbreaking series light years ahead of the rest was the almost unheard of quality of writing and acting, designed specifically for adults. Try getting that at the local movie theater, or on almost all of television, for that matter, it just doesn't happen. Though I have my favorites from this entire six season series, there isn't an episode that doesn't delight to this day. I am not one to get hooked on t.v. series, but what ""Sex"" offered was so witty, touching, sophisticated, hysterically funny, and, well...REAL, it was just an unbeatable combination. It is hard to imagine this series without the four actresses who play ""our girls"", and especially impossible to imagine it without Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw. I don't know whether the producers intended for her to be such a main force at the inception of this series, but she quickly established herself as the lead character, and, as executive producer to boot. What is even more amazing is that over the course of her increasing prominence and importance to the series, there is not, in the entire six years of production, even the slightest hint of any rivalry between the actresses, and their spirit of on screen generosity apparently translated off screen as well. This entire class act should serve as an example for all other productions in general. Not only in its quality, but, in the all around camaraderie that is evident, which is so rare in television, where unknowns make it big overnight, turn into demanding brats.... which is usually followed by their banishment into obscurity, or, at best, selling ThighMasters on Q.V.C. To the end, the cast of ""Sex"" remained the very definition of the term ""ensemble cast."" All involved in this series very smartly decided to go out on top, and the final episodes brought six years of fun, tears, and real friendship to a wonderful sense of closure that has not been duplicated, and probably never will. The series ending is without question the most touching, heartwarming, satisfying ending ever written. Is it obvious that I, like many, many others, loved ""our girls?"" Hell, I'm smitten, and I look forward to this wonderful set of dvd's providing me with years of renewed pleasure, and a sense of quality that I'm sure will only grow with time. Let's raise a toast to these four fabulous ladies, and all involved in this effort, for not only entertaining us, but, I don't think it's a stretch to say they taught us alot, especially about the value of true friendship.",1112227200,10,3420,4.913494809688581
2392995,3,B000ASDFJU,"This is really more a review of the DVDs than the show itself.  Without a doubt, Sex and the City is some of the best adult TV ever produced -- so well written and acted (except, perhaps, for Season 5, which is only so-so by comparison).  Sex and the City is 5 stars + insightful, meaningful entertainment.

That said, the video quality of the first couple of seasons is rather poor (like a cheap VHS-->DVD transfer).  Very grainy.  Hardly any significant extras come with the DVDs.  Maybe this is what one gets when the whole series goes for just $200 (one of the most amazing bargains around).

If you are concerned about video quality, I might wait until a better reissue.",1111536000,12,675,4.528925619834711

2393000,5,B000ASDFJU,"I finally have all of the SATC dvds!!  This is one of the best series to ever appear on tv.  I do agree with the previous writer who stated that WAY too much attention is given to Sara Jessica.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be Kims performance as Samantha.  That character, more than any other, gave us the ""Oh my God"" moments that made us love SATC so much.  It was her fearlesness as an actress that made this show what it is today.  Also, for the price they are demanding, there should be way more special features.  I was excited to put in the bonus features dvd for season 6 part 2, and to see a notation that there were deleted scenes from each season.  Unfortunately, there were only 1 or 2 scenes from each season, not much to get excited about.  Also, I don't think there were any audio commentaries until season 5, and then for a couple of episodes on each season.  With so many producers offering so many extras with dvds, this series extras are a little bit of a let down.  But even without the extras, it is worth it just to have the series that was ended way before it's time.  Anyone for the ""Samantha Jones show""?",1105228800,2,1138,4.193548387096774
2393001,3,B000ASDFJU,"I haven't purchased this set, but by my count, it'd be a lot cheaper to buy the individual seasons rather than the Complete Series box set (actually, the best deal seems to be to buy the Seasons 1-5 box set, then Season 6-I and Season 6-II individually). If the box set contains extras not found in the individual season releases, that might make it a worthwhile purchase....

Which leads me to my question: does the Complete Series box set include something extra that you won't get if you purchase the seasons individually? Seasons 2, 3, 4, 6-I, and 6-II, contain 3 discs, and Seasons 1 and 5 contain 2 discs, for a grand total of 19 discs. Yet, the contents of the Complete Series box set is listed at 20 discs?

2393004,5,B000ASDFJU,"During the years this show was such a huge success we didn't get HBO but I always assumed its praises were overly pretentious. That is until my sister got the complete set for Christmas and I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I may have been a big-time skeptic but, I must confess, I haven't enjoyed a series as much as this since ""Xena Warrior Princess"" and they are completely different! ""Sex and the City"" is not only a smart and addictive drama/comedy, it's filled with great acting, witty humor, clever writing, touching moments of friendship, and situations that have to do with love, heartache and lust, which we can all relate to in one way or another (although I doubt the average person has slept with as many men as these gals have!). It's true, these girls are obsessed with fashion (especially expensive shoes) and they love drinking martini's, but they are not at all ditzy. In fact, they each have upstanding careers, are very independent, and, for the most part, are okay with being single (except for the more conservative Charlotte who is determined to get married by season three). I'm only on season four yet a lot has already happened to Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. However, on a creative/entertainment level the episodes are showing no signs of slowing down because, just when you think they've covered every possible subject matter that primarily focuses on the highs and lows of relationships, they surprise you by reaching new ground. And to me it only seems to be getting better as the series progresses and New York City is the perfect setting for all this to be happening in. I'm just sad there were only six seasons and that the movie deal has been cancelled.

I also think the price is a bit outrageous for the number of episodes featured on each season (season five, I know, only has eight episodes!). Overall ""Sex and the City"" is a wonderful show, though, and one in which will greatly be missed by many.",1104796800,26,1960,4.681159420289855
