1066144,1,6305761027,"Saw this movie because I was at the Fieldhouse Bar in Iowa City the night they were doing some filming there.
The part of the movie that shows Iowa City is in about the first 20 minutes and thats it.
First I think they  are shown by a telemarketing place at Sycamore Mall and then eating at  Diamond Daves there.  I'm not sure..haven't been there in a while but I was  told that's where they were. They are shown driving along in downtown Iowa  City and park their vehicle on Washington Street by the Englert Theater.  Then it shows them going into the Fieldhouse from the College Street  ped-mall and it has a short dancefloor scene inside.  Then there is a scene  in the bathroom on the bar where a confrontation over 'narcotics' takes  place.  Then there is a shot of them running out of the bar into the  crowded ped-mall.
And that's it as far as Iowa City goes.
As for the  film itself...... If you get really annoyed by white people acting as if  they're black, you will not like this movie.  If you are a white person who  does think that you are balck, you might find this film interesting.  I  personally watched the movie on fast-forward because it annoyed me a bit  too much.  I just wanted to see the Iowa City parts.",955152000,4,1229,4.330396475770925

1066292,5,6305761027,"This movie shows what it could be like for white boys living in the country who glamorize the ghetto and want to be part of the hip-hop culture. They quickly learn, that when they get there, those who grew up in the ghetto see right through them! Overall, the movie was pretty good. Lots of funny moments, including the scene with Snoop, but there are some very dramatic and tense scenes too as the main character finds out he's bitten off more than he can chew!",1352851200,,462,4.383720930232558

1066370,4,6305761027,"There are certain phases every one goes through in regards to their race. For whites it starts with a denial that racism exists, then moves to a realization that inequalities exist between whites and other races, especially blacks. At this point most whites recede to their previous viewpoints and identify with whites even more strongly in order to deal with the negative emotions that facing these unpleasant facts evokes. There are more stages but that is all we need for this movie. The film is a study of what happens when, instead of identifying with their own culture, someone identifies with the oppressed culture. Flip is not aping the black culture because it is the cool thing to do. He is doing it to deal with the guilt thrust upon him from the actions of his ancestors. It is all in the monologue at the end. Overall a great movie. Funny and thought provoking.",1197849600,,874,4.681818181818182
1066371,5,6305761027,"Awesome movie!!! Being the old school rap fan I am, and having lived in both urban anrd rural areas in several states, I understood the humor in this movie.  This is one of those movies I can watch 100 times and still laugh. (kinda like Office Space).  Anyone that hates this movie just has no sense of humor at all.  I would rate it 10 out of 5 stars if I could!",1196467200,,363,4.013888888888889
1066372,1,6305761027,"this movie is so bad i had to stop watching it towards the end. for some reason i thought this was a comedy not a long boring drama. this movie would have been better if the writting was any good. it is just so bad that i couldn't even get offended by the use of the ""N"" word, it was just an awfull addition to my movie collection. Danny Hoch is still a good actor in my opionon, he just needs to talk to his agent or whomever is giving him scripts like this one to just say no. if he can turn down the sienfield show he can turn down these crummy movies as well.",1185494400,,563,3.8620689655172415

1066374,3,6305761027,"I was actually embarassed when I finally saw this movie at home with my family.  Everyone has already captured the essence of the movie - white farm boys looking to make it big in the world of rapping.  This movie was filmed in and around my home town and I was an extra for a few scenes, which I was totally excited about at the time, but then the embarassment snuck in after I finally got the opportunity to watch it.  It really is SO satirical and both very close and very far from the truth of the average midwest upbringing.  For the most part, I just found it very humorous after watching it a couple times and discussing it with other friends.

So, I've listed a couple of the things that I found pretty funny...Their only black friend seems to be the exact opposite of what they wanted out of the black rapper experience.  The girlfriend (Piper Perabo) goes from being the gangsta's girlfriend in this movie to being a hot bartender in Coyote Ugly.  I heard more of an East coast accent out of most of the characters, rather than the usually unnoticable midwestern accent.  I really loved the birthmark scene - just made me laugh again!

It's just one of those movies you gotta watch more than once (if you can get through it the first time).",1142640000,,1250,4.4
1066375,4,6305761027,"This movie is an excellent take on the ignorance of white farm kids who want to be black, wanna be thugs, and gangsta rappers. As an indie flick, the film lacks some of the sharpness one might expect but here it works in the film's favor. There is a sense of reality there, Flip just doesn't live in that reality. He wears an Iowa Hawkeye, Tim Dwight's in fact, football jersey, lives on a farm in Iowa, and is totally attracted to the bling and light of the rap game. As ridiculous as this seems to those outside of the midwest, this is more common than one might think.

I'm from Iowa, and in fact, this film was shot on location in and around my hometown of Davenport, Iowa, and the Quad Cities. I knew people like Flip and their struggle for acceptance and identity. Quite a few of my friends were in the film as minor characters and extras, and my ex-mayor was the curly headed police officer. There are lots of external shots of the Quad City area, Davenport's riverfront, Muscatine, and a shot of a close friend's award winning grafitti in Davenport that was in the Cabrini Green sequence (Nelly posed in front of a mural he did in a St. Louis graf competition for his first album and is on the inner sleeve). The reality is that Flip's farm neighborhood is on the outskirts of the Davenport area, which is one of the largest cities in Iowa and has it's own urban culture, like many smaller cities in America.

Being from there brings this film in perspective as a search for culture and acceptance. As a teacher and coach, and an ex-Iowan, I knew people who yearned for something new while others went along with this type of charade until they realized how ridiculous it is to act black. The funny moments are endless though, the horrible raps, the ""representin'"", the outfits, and the dream sequences and cameos. This is a movie that seems to grow on you with a ridiculous but somewhat serious message behind it all. I mean Snoop, Slick Rick, and Doug E. Fresh make appearances! Show this one to the people who you might know that fake the funk.",1126742400,8,2055,4.448275862068965

1066378,3,6305761027,"To me,this movie reflects the narrow view of what it means to be Black that many whites and some Blacks have about Blackness. That's no criticism of the movie,because it's a fact that there is a misguided view of Blacks that exists in many people's minds similar to that of these whiteboyz. Gangstas can come in all colors and not just Black.",1115424000,3,342,4.532258064516129

1066421,5,6305761027,"Loved this!  Smoking movie!  Funny Bright!  As a matter of fact it was first film I loved Snoop Dogg in-that scene in jail was hilarious!

Ill be damned if he didn't look like Michael Corleone-(Godfather)!  That kid-( Eric Rivas) will blow up son!
""Danny Hoch ""is known all over NY.  A genius born and bred in this city!  But if this becomes a cult classic which is what I predict.  He should continue this into Whiteboyz 2.

A nice comical Story and I expect more from that guy.  PS:  Look out for the Gangster Dream sequence"" for an actor playing a mob fence-(ERIC RIVAS  about to get whacked.  I think he will be the next Pacino.  He is something in a small scene with FAT JOE and Dr. Dre and Mr Talented Hoch Himself.  Dont miss this movie.

It was about a group of white but wanna-be black teens who think they should move to Chicago and become pro rappers.  You'd think this idea could be a humorous movie but it wasn't, it was just dumb.  I couldn't tell what was a joke and what was a joke and what wasn't.

It sounded hilarious, so when I saw it advertised for 5 dollars at the store, I figured, ""What the heck?""  What I saw was both hilarious and true at the same time, but it had its moments of annoyance.  Basically, it follows the adventures of 3 white kids from Iowa perpetrating the image of a ""gangsta"".  They finally go on a road trip to Chicago to the Cabrini Green projects and find out it ain't ""all good in the 'hood"".  In the end, they all learn to be themselves and not a trend.",1024876800,2,584,4.225225225225225

So I stayed in the comedy section cuz I love Comedy and I ran across this movie entitled ""Whiteboyz."" At first, I thought it was like another boring movie I didn't wanna waste my money on but I picked it up and read the back of the box which was quite interesting (plus it had Snoop Dogg's name on the front of the box which made me pick it up even quicker). To make a long story short, I bought the movie and took it home, popped it into the VCR and watched it for the first time. Sometimes, it takes me two times to watch a movie to understand it but it only took me one time to watch this movie and I must say, I was one of the funniest movies I've seen this year.
