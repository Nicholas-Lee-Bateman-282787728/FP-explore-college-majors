8479568,5,B005MQ58UY,I am just starting to learn the styles of the early blues guitarists. I am an advanced intermediate guitarist and found Tom Feldmann's teaching style is easy to follow and emjoyable.,1436054400,,182,4.903225806451613
8479569,5,B005MQ58UY,"Been neglecting my guitar past some years for bluegrass banjo. Got an old Vox twelve string acoustic for DADGAD and Vestapol but was looking to focus on artists we did not have access to years ago. Mississippi John Hurt means every note and word he ties together. I came across this run of studies by Tom Feldman. I have fingerpicked, sometimes fancy stuff, for years and immediately know when a real teacher knows and believes what he is doing is right. It is rare to find material that is presented that challenges the newer player and an old hand. Tom is focused in his presentation and does not ramble, but is precise and gets to the point of the piece being taught. The range of the material is unique. A great one chord song is worth the look alone. I look forward to further studies by this young talent. He could ""make it"" on his playing alone. Good for him for taking teaching seriously.",1389916800,,896,4.469512195121951
8479570,5,B005MQ58UY,Bought this as a gift for DH who is into gospel and blues.  He loves it.  Says the instructional part is very good.,1373328000,,115,3.9565217391304346
8479571,5,B005MQ58UY,"Although not familiar with the instructor, I found his teaching to be straight forward, easy to follow, and clear.  Being a gifted musician does not necessarily mean a gifted teacher, yet here we have both, the player and the teacher.  He breaks down the parts of the song carefully and slowly, and his performance to open the song is inspiring to the student.  Although this is a Level two to Level three teaching, (meaning advanced beginner to intermediate level) advanced intermediates will also enjoy making the beautiful and recognizable Mississippi John Hurt thumb style polished completions.  Excellent teacher, well chosen songs (my favorites include ""Mary, Don't You Weep"" and ""Blessed Be the Name""), solid camera work all come together for a must DVD for fans of fingerpicking, Mississippi John Hurt, and country gospel music.  I look forward to future teaching DVDs from Tom Feldman.  His low key approach is helpful and enjoyable.",1332028800,2,942,5.1644736842105265
8479572,5,B005MQ58UY,"I love thumb-picking, so I naturally love these songs. They are soulful and super fun to play and I am so happy I purchased this DVD. Many of the songs are just the chorus and verse repeated over again for instrumental breaks, meaning there is less to memorize and therefore quicker to learn. Beginning fingerstyle and thumb-picking guitarists will find these pieces perfect challenges for them, while the intermediate fingerstyle and thumb-picking guitarists will feel right at home and at relative ease. The advanced fingerstyle and thumb-picking guitarists will enjoy the simplicity as these tunes provide awesome melodies without the intricate fingerwork needed for a variety of advanced arrangements. Overall, this DVD is good for all levels (though primarily intermediate I would think, but still good for all) and I can't stress how fun these songs are to play! The best instructional guitar DVD I've probably ever purchased. If you're on the fence, jump to the ""buy it"" side, because you won't regret it!",1327190400,2,1012,5.176829268292683
