2550264,5,B000F3T3CS,"Sure, there have been better sung Nemorinos than Rolando Villazn's: Di Stefano, Kraus, Bergonzi, even the young Alagna, but none has been better acted or more convincing as a whole. In fact his acting is so good that it's on the level of the finest Broadway standards. He moves with the grace of a ballet dancer, and quite frankly, he is a joy to watch. And last but not least his singing is quite, quite good. Netrebko looks like a million dollars, and if she is not a master belcanto soprano like Scotto, she makes a pretty, nay, gorgeous Adina. The Otto Schenck production is nice to look at and frames well Villazn restless Nemorino. The public gives a standing ovation to the tenor, and in Vienna, that is something, before that he is asked to repeat Una Furtiva Lagrima to tremendous applause. In general I enjoyed this Elisir more than the Alagna on DECCA, it has a more adorable soprano, and a star performance from Villazn. The old Scotto-Bergonzi from Florence will always be a historic document of tremendous importance.",1166400000,72,1031,4.701657458563536
2550265,3,B000F3T3CS,"I like this performance very much. Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon were really great together. Leo Nucci is really good as Belcore, even though he is a little too old. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo was really great as Dulcamara and a joy to see and hear. Vocally the performance was really great and a joy to hear.

BUT. There are too many times I see very unprofessional behavior from both the leads, especially Anna Netrebko. After Belcore is finishes his entrance aria Netrebko applauds and acts as if she is admiring Leo Nucci and after then return to character. The same is with both of them, especially Netrebko again, when Villazon juggles with balls when he is singing an aria and finishes. Again she applauds. I think that the applauding from the singers on stage when it is not in their character or part of the story is totally unacceptable. There are also times when Netrebko and Villazon are singing a duet that she cannot help but lay her head on his lap even though the character isn't supposed to pay much attention to his affection of her.
This unprofessional behavior is what detracts the two stars. I have the 1964 Figaro performance from Salzburg were the artists take bows after an aria, but that was normal back then. In this day and age is the unprofessionalism displayed by Anna Netrebko unacceptable. Her singing is really exceptional but if she cannot stay in character during a performance  she should stick to concerts or record operas on CD. I am sorry that I feel this and I am probably in the minority, but even Renata Scotto (who was a much bigger star than Netrebko) in her magnificent performance in Luisa Miller from 1979 could stay in character at all times. I hope that this is not a new trend.",1166140800,16,1727,4.640522875816994
2550276,5,B000F3T3CS,"I bought the DVD version some years ago and greatly enjoyed this production of L'Elisir d'amore. But as soon as the Blu Ray version came out, I replace it with the Blu-ray. What a treat to the eyes and ears. I also have several other versions of this opera. Of the more recent production, there is not a single production which can compare this Vienna opera with Netrebko and Villazon. In 2015 opera season, I saw the Paris Opera production at the Bastille, but I was totally disappointed with the somewhat modern costume and simplified stage setting. But due to budget constraint, it is now norm. It's going to be very hard to top this Vienna production. If anyone is interested in getting L'Elisir d'amore video, get this one. You cannot go wrong. The multi-format version includes Blu-ray.",1458518400,4,792,4.746376811594203

2550289,5,B000F3T3CS,"I laughed my a** off! What a fun night! Give yourself a break from the tragedies of ""Don Carlo"", pop a big bowl of popcorn and prepare yourself to be entertained! Rolando, despite his breathtaking tenor voice is a natural comic.!. Charlie Chaplin-ish you have to watch his subtle gestures and facial expressions and just be irreverent for one night!  If  Rolando is Chaplin then Anna Netrebko is his comic straight man! The dynamic duo are so compatible they can sing the heavy drama of La Boheme and switch to Donizetti  without missing a note! In real life his alter ego is a clown which he embraces with youthful exuberance as relief from his high stressed life of rehearsals, travel and performances. Meanwhile, if Nessum Dorma is Pavarotti's song then Una Furtiva Lagrima is Villazon's signature aria. None can sing it like he can. As his one serious aria in the opera you can't help but be reminded of who the main character really is. By writing such a beautiful and serious song in the middle of the comedy Donizetti helps to remind you that despite outward (""simpleton"") appearances, inwardly Nemorino still has feelings, dreams and aspirations just like everyone else and yearns for love and acceptance. His realization that the woman he loves -the beautiful Adina - (Netrebko) loves him back is like the sun coming out; beautiful rays of light reflected in Villazon's voice which floats across the stage straight to your own heart! Of course you want to see him get the girl in the end!",1405555200,5,1497,4.772200772200772
2550290,5,B000F3T3CS,"The following is a reprint of my review, dated Feb. 2007 in the WholeNote magazine of Toronto, Canada under their copyright.

When Donizetti was told that Rossini completed Barber of Seville in 2 weeks, he replied: This doesnt surprise me. He has always been lazy!  Donizetti was even more prolific than Rossini, producing 73 operas during a short and tragic life. This became the very reason why he fell into disrepute and most of his operas disappeared from stage for 150 years. Luckily however, due to the great belcanto revival of the 1960s, championed by three great divas, Joan Sutherland, Marilyn Horne and Beverly Sills, many of Donizettis forgotten operas came to the fore again.  LElisir dAmore is an early work but because of its melodic richness, a charming story combining comedy and heartfelt pathos and well differentiated characterizations for the four principals, it has made its way into the hearts of audiences and never left the stage. In addition, the tenor lead has been a favorite of such greats as Caruso, Gigli, Tagliavini and Pavarotti.

  This new DVD is a welcome addition to LElisirs already plentiful video library.  Its chief attraction is Anna Netrebko whose gorgeous voice is only outshone by her youthful beauty, healthy vitality and natural comic acting ability. She literally lights up the stage.
Mexican tenor,Rolando Villazon has a strong, beautifully modulated voice,  excellent characterization and a delightful, almost athletic ability to move on the stage. His rendition of Una furtive lacrima was so heartrendingly beautiful that he had to repeat it.
Of the two baritone roles Leo Nucci, perhaps the last of the  Italian school of great baritones doesnt measure up to my favorite, Juan Pons in vocal power or youthful looks. On the other hand, Ildebrando dArcangelo, a relative newcomer is very entertaining in the buffo role and has the voice to match.  Alfred Eschwes conducting is most sympathetic and stylish",1404518400,4,1955,5.138801261829653
2550291,5,B000F3T3CS,"Ive regarded prior performances of this opera as between silly and almost slapstickish, depending on how they portrayed Nemorino, Belcore and Dulcamara. This is the exception. The director and the players actually gave this performance dignity, while retaining the proper storyline. The only silly part was when El Dottore made mechanical man movements, while dancing, with Adina, during the wedding feast.

 This is a traditionally staged and traditionally costumed rendition.

 Villazns and Netrebkos outstanding performances only added to the quality of the presentation. Each sang and acted excellently and, as usual, their chemistry is almost magical.

 This is a LElisir dAmore to keep.",1402876800,7,692,5.669902912621359
2550292,5,B000F3T3CS,"Excellent acting, gorgeous singing and overall lots of fun! Enjoy this gem over and over! the great Otto Schenk knew how to stage this opera to perfection!",1399075200,,155,4.777777777777778
2550293,4,B000F3T3CS,"I rated this four stars because chorus and orchestra overpowered Roland and Anna. You think sound techs could have fixed that problem. To me,  Leo Nucci as Belcore was too old for the part.  I did not find Villazon too much of a buffoon; He was playful.  Villazon is a good actor as well.

I consider this a wonderful version with the right amount of  sweetness, humor, and pathos.",1394409600,2,381,4.463768115942029
2550294,5,B000F3T3CS,"This is an opera for the whole family, even the kids will love it. The music is beautiful. Anna Netrebko is ear and eye candy, Rolando Villazon is as good a comedian as he is a singer and incredibly agile. Ildebrando d'Arcangelo also shows off his flair for comedy as the traveling medico who peddles his cure-all. Villazon received so much applause for his ""Una furtiva lacrima"" aria that he sang it twice and appeared moved to tears himself by the audience's response. He is simply adorable as the ""village idiot"". His performance alone makes this DVD a ""must have and see"". It is also a good introduction to opera for those who have never seen or heard one and perhaps have never been interested in opera.",1389139200,2,708,4.582677165354331
2550295,5,B000F3T3CS,"Villazon is not only one of the best tenors around, but he is almost as good an actor. Netbreko is adequate. A must for any collection.",1388966400,,135,4.230769230769231
2550296,5,B000F3T3CS,Just a great opera to watch especially with stars like Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon they performed just beatiful and I recommend buying it.,1387238400,,145,5.083333333333333
2550297,4,B000F3T3CS,"This is a splendid performance from the Wiener Staatsoper with two live wire soloists in the lead roles.  Rolando Villazon does an such outstanding 'Una furtiva lagrima (a furtive tear) that the  audience wouldn't let the opera go on until he did a repeat.  Opera often provokes exreme responses from fans of one singer or another.  Netrebko from Russia and Villazon from Mexico both provide a vivid stage presence and lend their world class voices to this enterprise.  Its a great intrduction to opera for someone who doesn't want to sit through long monologues or florid 'canary' arias.

The story is a comedy about a penny poor young man in an Italian village who has a crush on on the town beauty.  She's somewhat interested but would like to be supported in reasonable comfort.  He comes to believe that a love potion from a travelling quack doctor will change her mind and spends his last penny.on a love potion from  Dr. Dulcamara.  From there it is still a long road to the altar.  L'Elisir has been around for almost two hundred years and remains one of the most popular stage works worldwide.  If you are looking for something different from Les Miz and a lot more upbeat. give it a try.  My DVD had a slight problem with the sound.  The voices came through fine, but the solo voices came through at a lower level than the chorus numbers.  If I set the volume at a comfortable level for the solo singers, the choral singers were too loud.  Check the reviews from other buyers.  If they don't mention my problem, you might be ok.  And, of course it might be my hearing.",1386720000,2,1578,4.535460992907802

I really, really love Netrebko, whom I saw at the Maryinsky in St. Peterburg (Don Giovanni), one of the high points of my life.  I like this production of L'Elisir, but the sound on my DVD has a tendency to recede at a few points, especially with the bass voices.  I have tried to fiddle with it, to no avail.  Not to worry, though.  An entertaining production, with an excellent cast.",1380758400,4,540,4.525773195876289

2550318,3,B000F3T3CS,"There are numerous reviews of this production, and crowning it, the Grammophone even named this the 'best on DVD'.
Well, on Youtube, there exists this Otto Schenk production at Vienna State Opera performed in 1989, reocrded by ORF, but present 'not' commercially available, with Adina by Alida Ferrarini, Nemorino by Francisco Araiza and Dulcamara by Rolando Panerai, Belfiore by Alberto Rinaldi.
THAT cast, I report, is artistically superior to THIS 21st century cast, if not visually.
Not only is the singing superior - Ferrarini's Donizettian style simply blows Netrebko to the dust, Araiza's vocalism Villazon simply no match, Panerai a much more seasoned singer than D'Arcangelo, Rinaldi much younger than Nucci here and more convincing as a suitor of Adina, but that the cast THERE actually acted better than this 21st century star-studded cast!
Ferrarini's Adina in particular is worthy of mention.  This underrated soprano is indeed Adina incarnate in her demeanour and vocal acting. Even if less attractive than Netrebko (who is, any way?), her minx-like manners and sweet looks cut a wonderfully pert and lively figure, and her singing, really, is a real force of nature!  The voice is focused and agile, with utter capability to shade every nuance, and with spitfire coloraturas to boot.  The perfect Adina, simply put.
Francisco Araiza is no longer young in that 1989 performance, but his Nemorino is not only vocally outstanding, but also musically outstanding.  He acts with utter elan and innocence of a young peasant.  If Pavarotti fails to convince visually as a young and boyish Nemorino, Araiza manages to do so.  While Villazon has both the voice and looks for the role, his vocalism is no match for either Pavarotti or Araiza.
What remains is, of course, for THAT 1989 immaculate recording to be released commercially!",1360800000,4,1839,5.175084175084175
2550319,4,B000F3T3CS,I have never seen a better performance of L'Elisir d'Amore.  The DVD itself leaves something to be desired.  The balance between the orchestra and the singers is unsatisfactory. The orchestra is too loud.,1359849600,,204,5.151515151515151
2550320,5,B000F3T3CS,"This is light-hearted with a very easy-to-watch Netrebko as Adina and a witty and expressive Villaz&oacute;n as Nemorino.  The sergeant and Dottor Dulcamera are fun and there's an obvious bond between the cast and even the orchestra that puts the viewer at ease.

I like it, my toddler watches it repeatedly, and my high school students love this performance; it mesmerizes them and isn't so heavy like a Tosca or Turandot, yet still has an aria, ""Una furtiva lacrima"" - ""A stealthy tear"" (done beautifully) that inspires youth.

I can't understand why those who dislike Netrebko so much would buy this DVD.  Is she perfect? No.

Does she have most of what makes a good performance? Yes; Netrebko can act, she can sing, she can dance.  She's pretty, she's energetic, and has a joyful expression.  She's not Callas, let's get on with it.  If you're an opera snob then you know what you're in for when you purchase this DVD, it has Netrebko, yes.  She's Russian so no, she wasn't weaned on a romance language.  She's still enjoyable in many ways.  She's called ""La Bellissima"" by fans, not ""La sonorissima"" or ""La coloratissima.""

All in all, very enjoyable even for a native speaker of Italian.",1359504000,3,1193,4.765853658536585
2550331,1,B000F3T3CS,"L'elisir d'amore is a light and funny opera, so a recording of it would make a good gift for somebody who is relatively new to opera. This particular recording won't make a great gift though. I think Anna's timbre is too dark and Slavic for this light role. The main problem is that her coloratura is so weak that she fails to be a vocally credible Adina. I grant that she has good chemistry with Villazon and that her acting is decent. But opera is music first and acting second. Musically and technically, Anna is only a mediocre Adina, and no amount of acting can make one overlook this basic problem. Villazon delivers a good Una furtiva lacrima, but there's no sufficient reason for buying this recording, when there are many others of better quality out there (for a great Adina, see Angela Gheorghiu in the Lyon Opera recording; for a great Rodolfo, Pavarotti remains unmatched).",1355961600,3,886,4.685897435897436

2550335,5,B000F3T3CS,"This recording of L'Elisir d'Amore was made in 2005 at the Vienna State Opera. This is quite a small theatre and this has an impact on the production which is rather more intimate in feel than is often the case with larger venues.

The production is firmly traditional with completely believable costumes and set. The chorus have quite a large vocal and dramatic role in this opera so they need to be actively participative both collectively and individually. This is achieved very well throughout this performance.

The two star roles of Adina and Nemorino dominate this opera and feature Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon at a fairly early stage in their respective careers when both have the freshness of youth on their side. It is quite clear from numerous glances and more obvious interactions that they seem to have a special empathy with each other and this makes a huge difference to the veracity of the performance and to the viewers' enjoyment as the story unfolds on the stage. Both are in fine voice too and the stand-out aria is the touching `Una furtiva lagrima' sung most affectingly by Villazon and which leads to prolonged demands for an encore from the highly enthusiastic audience. They are suitably rewarded and their renewed applause almost stops the show! Netrebko is by no means over-shadowed by this however as her immediately preceding aria `Quanto amore!' is of the same calibre.

Leo Nucci as Belcore is clearly no more the young man as described by Adina but he has a twinkle in the eye which cannot be missed and obviously enjoys playing his role opposite the very attractive and nimble Netrebko. This genuine attraction has the effect of encouraging Nucci to shed years and to bring out some of the most vibrant acting I have ever seen from him. His voice is still in very good shape so he makes a good character part. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as the wily Dulcamara also clearly relishes his role in much the same sort of way as Nucci and he is really very amusing as well as being vocally excellent.

Humour and amusement are strong features of this production and much of this stems from the very vibrant interactions between the above mentioned members of the cast and this is quite in addition to the humour built into the script. There are many, seemingly improvised, moments of humour sometimes verging on the slapstick such as Villazon tripping and bumping into things in a bumbling manner, his skilful turn of juggling with 3 apples (he was a circus performer at one time), Netrebko closing his mouth opened in astonishment plus many more small instances of natural good humour.

The orchestra under Alfred Eschwe is on good form and the on-stage trumpeter, Konrad Monsberger, is a nice visual touch.

The camera work is able to draw the viewer into the action very well and the imaging is crisp with good colour throughout. The sound is good but microphone placing produces moments of reduced volume from the solo singers as they move slightly out of optimum range. The effect is actually more realistic in the crowd scenes for example where the chorus is more powerfully projected compared to the more recessed balance of the soloists. I would not wish to make too much of this as I personally prefer this than the more even, but totally fake effect, of the radio mikes now becoming regrettably more commonplace. The sound is presented in DD 5.0, DTS 5.0 and stereo. The playback level is far lower than normal but can be adjusted via the volume control, in my case by about 4.5 dB.

The recent Blu-ray version differs in presentation slightly from the DVD by offering stereo or surround sound but does not give further information as to which type of surround sound. The low level playback is identical to the DVD but the picture is crisper than the DVD as expected. The biggest gain is the added depth to the sound and this is apparent from the start of the overture. The BD version is from the HD source material and is the result of Warner taking over EMI and making BD versions available. Neither the DVD not the BD offer sleeve note information about track listings or the opera plot and could be described as extremely minimalist.

This is a most enjoyable production and performance absolutely bubbling with vivacity. The cast interactions on stage seem to be very specially combined and this extra sizzle is very much appreciated by the enthusiastic audience. The whole effect is enhanced by the more intimate nature of the relatively small theatre. I would expect purchasers of this disc to derive great pleasure from it on repeat viewings and therefore it seems reasonable to suggest that this is very much a 5 star product despite the few instances of slightly recessed solo voices.",1351468800,5,4733,4.784577723378213
2550336,5,B000F3T3CS,"This is an excellent rendition of the opera. The singers playing Adina and Nemorino are very good and their acting is  first class too.

""Una furtiva lagrima"" had to be repeated by Netrebko because the Viennese audience ""demanded"" it. (They wouldn't quit applauding until he sang it again.)

I like this opera very much, which was one of Pavarotti's favorites too. He loved to play Nemorino.
So I recommend it to anyone who likes light Italian opera.",1336694400,3,450,4.818181818181818
2550337,5,B000F3T3CS,"Italian composer Donizetti composed at least fifty operas in his lifetime.  Some are superbly written, others are quite adequate, and others are just plain bland. Several are highly successful, and are staples in various opera houses all around the world. L'Elisir D'Amore is one of his most successful comic operas, and judging only by its scenario, it's a small wonder why it's so popular even today. It's a simple story, but the music is satisfyingly filled to the brim with legitimate humor and Bel Canto delights. Plus, the four main characters are likable, even the antagonist (it is a comedy after all).

Set in an 18th Century Italian village (where else?), Nemorino, the penniless village idiot, is in love with a beautiful woman named Adina. Since she is far richer than he is, he knows that there's a very slim chance that she will admire him. Despite the social status, he will do all he can to please her. When an eccentric traveling salesman named Dulcamara arrives in the village, Nemorino asks if he possesses a love potion that will make Adina fall in love with him. Dulcamara shows him the potion and sells it to him. Unfortunately, the so-called love potion is only wine and Nemorino remains ignorant of this fact. Complications occur with army sergeant Belcore, who is also in love with Adina. And then...well, it's best to watch the rest of the opera to see what happens.

This Viennese production is thankfully traditional. If it was given a modern/post-modern approach, it would've made much less sense. Imagine if it took place in a present-day New York alley (or worse, a Cubist oil refinery) instead of an Italian village. Anyway, the 18th Century costumes and sets look authentic. The soloists appear to be the true stars of this production. Their dictions, phrasings, and of course, acting abilities are highly marvelous. You can easily tell that they had such a fun time with their respective roles. Netrebko as Adina is wonderful: she is easily a winner with her expressive singing. Villazn is the highlight of this production as he is the ultimate Nemorino. He's got the village idiot personality down to a T. His excitement and comic timing brings new energy to this opera. I've seen the Metropolitan Opera's staging of D'Amore from the early 80's, and while the late Pavarotti is no doubt a fantastic tenor, he seems to lack the energetic behavior that is required for such a character. Villazn has got it, and he gives such an amazing performance. D'Arcangelo plays the quirky salesman Dulcamara, and although he looks a bit too young for the role, he sings with comic passion. He clearly enjoys playing the character with his lively expressions. Leo Nucci has sung as Belcore for such a long time, and his expertise brings top quality for the antagonist. He's still got it after all these years. Finally, maestro Eschw conducts the opera with tight flexible tempi. He never controls the music with a snail's pace, nor does he rush it like a horse on caffeine. The quick tempos that are chosen are necessary for such a lighthearted opera. The orchestra and choir of the Weiner Staatsoper (aka, Vienna State Opera) are in top form from beginning to end.

This is the production of D'Amore that I would highly recommend. There are a few arias that have been cut, but overall, it's highly amusing, and just completely enjoyable to watch and listen. Both acts are full of surprises: there's even one instance in which D'Arcangelo actually breaks the fourth wall near the end of the second act. This is what makes this production so fun and satisfying. Some of the humor may be outdated, but it's simple old-fashioned enjoyment and it still holds up compared to the lame toilet humor that we normally see on television. I had such a wonderful time watching this production, and I think it's time that I buy a CD recording of the entire opera. I'll find out which one I should purchase sooner or later.

2550339,5,B000F3T3CS,"""L'Elisir d'Amore"" is a much-loved favourite of mine, and it was a true joy to watch this outstanding live production from the Vienna State Opera, which surpassed my high expectations.

Rolando Villazn and Anna Netrebko are ideally matched and perfectly suited to the roles of Nemorino and Adina.  Vocally they shine, dramatically they sparkle, and their shared sense of fun is very evident.  The stage action is anything but static, with plenty of expended energy in response to a sparkling tempo from the orchestra.

Nemorino is one of my favourite opera characters.  To dismiss him as ""the village idiot"" does him a great injustice.  He may be uneducated, but he is loyal and instinctively wise, and one has only to listen to his first duet with Adina (""Una Parola, Adina"") to know that he has the soul of a poet.  From the moment Rolando Villazn walks on stage with the delicious ""Quanto E Bella"", he is in his element, vocally and dramatically.  He employs just enough comedy and pathos without overdoing it, and he takes me all the way from laughter to tears and back again.  After a touchingly beautiful ""Una Furtiva Lagrima"", the Viennese audience demands (and receives) a moving encore.

Anna Netrebko's Adina is playful and capricious, but right from the start she allows little glimpses of a deeper side, which finally emerges as she responds to the voice of her heart and the irresistible Nemorino.  Vocally she is brilliant, and her on-stage chemistry with Mr Villazn is electric.

Another highlight is Leo Nucci's Belcore - a real comic gem.  For me, this opera works best when Belcore is played as a caricature, as he is here - the swaggering, self-confident sergeant - and the perfect contrast to Nemorino.  Likewise, Ildebrando d'Arcangelo's younger, smooth talking salesman seems just right for Dr Dulcamara in this setting.  He too, makes good use of his comic talents.  Not to be overlooked is the irrepressible Inna Los, revelling in the cameo role of Giannetta.

My only negative comment concerns the sound quality on the DVD - it is not as clear and sharp as it could be, and I found I had to tweak my audio settings and graphic equaliser quite a bit to get it right.  However, that is a minor technical flaw, and no reflection on the performance itself.

If laughter is the best medicine, then my advice is ... do yourself a favour, and purchase this efficacious and sweet-tasting dose of ""The Elixir of Love""!",1319673600,7,2434,4.8076923076923075
2550340,5,B000F3T3CS,"This may be the most enjoyable operatic performance I have ever experienced, and I have enjoyed many of them, both onstage and on DVD. I do not include LP or CD versions, since the visual aspect of opera is absent there.

Comedy, in any setting, is among the most difficult of endeavors to pull off. Timing is everything, and for an early (1832) 19th Century opera to still be comedic seems even more difficult, especially since most operaphiles know the work, thus surprise is unlikely. I think that the fact that this disc has generated over 50 reviews, some both detailed and scholarly, reflects on the success of the performance.

I for one, do not subscribe to the cult of former great sopranos, but I do not mean this in any way to be critical of those who do. I have seen Sutherland, Caballe, Sills and others in performances, and have and enjoy recordings of these legendary singers. But living where live opera ain't, to indulge my operaphilia ( OK, addiction!), I must rely on the DVD, of which I now have about 90. That means experiencing and evaluating and enjoying relative newcomers  (for me) to the stage.

My first experience with Ms Netrebko was in the two German galas, one from Berlin and the other from Baden Baden (both available here on DVD). Metaphorically, she blew my socks off! She has a smooth, rich voice, and her technique, especially vowel placement and pronunciation is fantastic. Admittedly, she lacks the extended range of the true coloratura, and the vocal flexibility associated with that voice, but her Norina is credible as a character and vocally stunning, IMHO. Her acting skills are remarkable, too, and it is clear that she really enjoys what she does.

Similarly with Villazon: he has a big, bright tenor voice with a brilliant legato line and an evenness through the registers. He really hams up the role of Nemorino, especially in the first part of Act I. His is simply a first rate performance.

I have always thought of Leo Nucci as a Verdian, and have enjoyed several of his performances as such. But he really shines in this comedy. So does Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as Dulcamara. This is my first experience with him, but I note that he does a phenomenal job as Escamillo in the new Carmen on Decca (Covent Garden) His is a rich but bright tone with a huge top.

But as exceptional as the singers are, it is the totality of the performance that makes this a five star review. It all just works!

Disc quality is what I have come to expect of Decca. Clear, crisp focused video is combined with the sonic detail of the DTS surround to make the recording the ""next best thing to being there"". And I can reprise the event any time I wish.",1306627200,4,2680,4.60377358490566
2550351,5,B000F3T3CS,"I rated the Pavarotti/Battle Elixer of Love DVD 4 stars but continued to search for a better one due to Pavarotti's inability to act. While Pavarotti is a buffoon playing a buffoon, Villazon is a dashing Nemorino masterfully playing a charming buffoon. So well in fact that you think Netrebko would fall in love with him without the Elixer, which is of course the point of this wonderful comedy. Donizetti's enchanting comedy 'L'Elisir d'Amore' was performed with such brilliance, playfulness and sense of fun that I found myself hoping Elixer of Love were four hours instead of two. I would agree that there is a special chemistry between Netrebko and Villazon that is absolutely charming and at the end they engage in a smoldering embrace and kiss which leaves me believing they must be an item. Villazon delivers a tenderly sung 'Una furtiva lacrima' bringing down the house and requiring an encore. The snake oil salesman played by Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and the Sergeant Belcore played by Leo Nucci are superbly sung and acted. Staging, costumes, acting, orchestration, video quality, audio quality and subtitling are all superb. This is a perfectly charming and touching opera.",1305936000,4,1183,5.103092783505154

In ""legitimate"" theater it would be difficult to mount a successful production in Austria, performed in Italian, with principals from Russia, Mexico, Italy, and Moldova, yet that is what this production of ""L'Elisir d'Amore"" does- with a Viennese conductor. I listen to opera for the singing, and when I attend the opera, whether in person or on DVD, I want to see good acting and staging. I also want to see something that is reasonably true to the composer's intentions. This does not mean that an opera originally set in 17th Century Spain must always be set in that time and place, but I want the opera to be recognizable. This ""Elixir"" is beautifully sung and acted, and cleverly staged. I am the first to complain when an actor is over the top in hamminess, and I can see how people could see that in Rolando Villazon's Nemorino, but I found his portrayal to be fun and engaging, and his singing superb. The voice is big, but he keeps under perfect control. I thought his antics were in character and it appeared that his Adina, Anna Netrebko, thought so, too. I could look at her and listen to her all day long, and her Adina is just flirtatious enough and just restrained enough to balance Nemorino.

Everyone in the cast is fully into their roles and you can't fault the acting, the tenor as others have noted, completely inhabiting his character and delivering a comic performance of outstanding quality. The main problem with the music is that there are a lot of notes hiding the lack of a good tune until our hero sings Una furtiva lagrima in the second act notable for it's lack of decorative notes and the beauty and simplicity of it's melody. He is rewarded with such a long ovation that he finally breaks character and the conductor decides ""Well, let's do it again fella."" He sings the aria again to another stunning ovation and tears come to his eyes. Anna gets quite a nice ovation after she sings her dazzling aria declaring her love.

2550382,4,B000F3T3CS,"L'Elisir D'Amore is one of the finest operas in the repertoire.  Its melodies flow so effortlessly that it's easy to lose sight of how fine and inspired Donizetti's accomplishment is.  And it's been well served on DVD (e.g., the Met version with Pavarotti, Battle, etc.).

This is a delightful production of L'Elisir, one that for sheer comedy is equalled only (to my knowledge) by Pelly's production of Fille du Regiment with Natalie Dessay. Rolando Villazon's Nemorino is the embodiment of what would happen if Harpo Marx found his voice, and it turned out to be a gorgeous tenor.  The duet ""Voglio dire, lo stupendo elisir"" where Nemorino buys the ""elixir"" from Dr. Dulcamara (Ildebrando D'Archangelo) is not only beautiful music beautifully sung, but a laugh-out-loud marvel of timing and energy that I've watched at least a dozen times.  It's worth the price of the DVD all by itself.

But I usually switch over to my DVD of the Met version for Act II.  Perhaps by this time in the opera I'm finding Anna Netrebko's Adina overly coltish.  For all that the Met version is more static, I seem to find the denouement more moving.  One big reason for my switch is a substantial cut in the Villazon/Netrebko version. We lose Adina's dialogue with Nemorino while all the village girls are making up to him, and the wonderful ensuing quartet.  I have no idea why this number was cut; it's not only a highlight of the show, but the point that signals the beginning of Adina's change of heart.  In a way, the cut is a backhanded tribute to the high quality Donizetti maintains throughout ""L'Elisir.""  In virtually any other opera, cutting material this good would be unthinkable.

On the other hand, I like Leo Nucci's Belcore in this version better than Juan Pons in the Met version.  Both sing well, but Nucci, while a little old for the role, captures Belcore's bluster and bullying perfectly.  Pons' portrayal is bland by comparison.

I could make more comparisons between the two versions, but I'll close by saying that I wouldn't willingly part with either of them.  Lovers of this eminently lovable opera are lucky indeed.",1230163200,11,2125,4.809917355371901

This is Opera Buffa in all its glory...we come to have fun, not to ponder the meaning of life. Sometimes this can degenerate into slapstick, but these wonderful performers never did, even when Anna broke character to applaud Villazon's juggling act...yes, she broke character...look at her face....Villazon breaks character, too, but that was necessary to coordinate the encore of ""una furtiva lagrima"" with Maestro Eschwe. [And what an encore]!

Every one of the principals was perfectly cast, and in fine form. Rolando Villazon is all we have come to expect as the hapless Nemorino...we could almost believe he's the local fool. Anna Netrebko is absolutely delectable...she does everything well, and it's nice to see her live to the end of the show. Her comic by-play with all the other characters is flawless. Leo Nucci as the lustful Sgt.

...a word about the REAL star; Ildebrando D'Archangelo as the quack Dr. Dulcamara carries the show. Perfect casting...flawlessly performed comedy. Nowhere is it written that the basso buffo has to be fat, and old. If Maestro D'Archangelo doesn't have quite the voice of the late, great, Salvatore Baccaloni, he still makes us believe, and makes us laugh. He has to move the plot line thru his interaction with the other characters, and he NEVER misses a beat...his dance scene with Anna is almost slapstick, but doesn't cross the line [nor does his sale of a bottle to the prompter].

It suffuses his hands and face.

Some people also recommend the DG filming of the Pavarotti/Battle/Met. It has been a some time since I saw that version; I only remember it as an excruciating bore. Pavarotti was doubtless a great singer, but Villazon had more acting ability in that little finger than Pavarotti generally displayed in his entire body. (I must also confess that Battle, and the productions she is in, generally leave me cold.)

Netrebko also inhabits her part--it doesn't hurt, of course, that she is ravishingly beautiful.

2550412,4,B000F3T3CS,"This production is lovely in almost every respect. The scenery, costumes, lighting and direction all are appropriate and most of the time are very effective. The cast they assembled for this performance is about as big a name cast as you could put together for a single opera these days. Netrebko, Villazon, Nucci and D'Arcangelo are all big names in the opera world now, and in the case of Nucci for several years.

Anna Netrebko as Adina is beautifully cast, she looks the part and acts the part well, and even if her voice doesn't always have the agility required for this role she places everything well and sings as sweetly as I ever heard her.

Leo Nucci as Belcore is surprising, he is no longer a young man, but sings and acts the role with as much energy and confidence as I have seen. He doesn't necessarily look the part of the strapping, young womanising soldier but you tend to forgive this in opera.

Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as Dulcamara for me is the highlight. He has a comic genius that has shone through many productions of many operas in the past, no more so than his Leporello at the Salzburg festival. In this his voice is supple and agile, as he always is. His gondolier song with Adina and his entrance aria should be held up as examples and models for the next generation of young singers... no patter here... a perfectly placed, and sung, not spoken, performance here.

For me, the weakest link in this cast was Villazon. No one denies that the man has an amazing voice and a wonderful energetic presence on stage, but for Nemorino, his voice just isn't right. His voice at times is far too heavy, or as another reviewer stated 'muscular'. The best he sound in this opera is towards the end where Nemorino becomes forceful, knowing what he wants and knowing he can get it; Villazon's power really works here. But in the lighter moments like the beautiful aria 'Una Furtiva Lagrima' his voice is too harsh and displays little nuance or affection for the material. He also has a bad tendency to scoop to notes towards to top of his range which takes away from the purity of the performance. The encore that is done after this aria was a surprise... I didn't think the performance was good enough to get an encore... stunt? Perhaps? I would have preferred either Juan Diego Florez or Roberto Alagna (although Alagna doesn't have the voice of Villazon or Florez)... but the commercial attraction of pairing Villazon and Netrebko (who have a very obvious, powerful onstage chemistry)would be too much to turn down for a company life the Weiner Staatsoper.

The musical direction of Eschwe is fine, tight, controlled and full of life an fun... what more do you want for L'Eliser.

with great beauty, to match her own physical lovliness. She would often open her mouth a bit too much, (as critics have noted,) but she has changed that habit and kept the lovely sound, and the look is more natural. She sparkles, and the couple delights...beautifully!",1200614400,,412,4.9

2550415,3,B000F3T3CS,"I must confess that I went to sleep twice during Act I of this performance, and had to chop the entire opera into three slots to view, some thing that happens very rarely with me.
What's the distraction?
I would not call it 'unprofessionalism'. It is as clear as mud that the distractions were meant to BE there, just that I do not find them tasteful.
The first major distraction is the staging. Cannot imagine it is the Vienna Stateopera that this production was being staged. May be I have been spolt by the MET productions on DVD. It looks crowded - the stage in Act I is unduely crowded, and the chorus appear to move as if sleep walking throughout the Act.
Things turn much brighter with Dulcarmara and Nemerino's famous duet in the second Act. However, things quickly relapses into chaos when Belcore returns with Adina. However beauteous is Anna Netrebko's person and voice, the characterisation of this Adina is not served by having her twisting her body and hurling her limbs every time an emphasis of emotion is being called for. This is the second big distraction of the drama. This is a sort of 'over-acting'. Adina is supposed to be a self-righteous and heady sort of girl. This production's Adina is however a feather-headed, giddy walking doll.
Rolando Villazon characterises Nemerino in more or less the similar manner. He got his nick-name 'Mr Bean' as a result of this.
No such visual nonesense from Nucci or d'Archangelo.
There are some strong vocal performances in this production, though. D'Archangelo and Villazon gave a wonderful duet, and Villazon generally proved himself to be a true vocal talent. Netrebko's coloratura hasn't improved since her Kirov days, but the gorgeously even voice made up much for the lack of vocal technic.
This production would probably benefit a lot more if a CD is issued in lieu of a DVD.",1199836800,9,1843,4.780564263322884
2550416,5,B000F3T3CS,"A delight from beginning to end!  Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon have great chemistry.  They both seem to love the fun of it all.  All the characters are well cast. The Donizetti music alone is such fun all by itself, but adding the opera itself makes it magical.  I can't imagine anyone who enjoys light opera not loving this.",1198368000,3,331,4.559322033898305
2550417,5,B000F3T3CS,"I must confess from the start that, although I think this is a five-star production, my favorite L'Elisir on DVD remains the Macerata Opera production from 2002, without a single well-known performer in it (see my review if you're interested). That said, if not as magical as the Macerata production, this one is also stellar.

To start with, the production's well-known performers must share star billing with the sets and costumes. They transport us to the provincial village that the characters inhabit. Even Dulcamara makes his entrance in a cart pulled by a real donkey.

Adina is the perfect role for Anna Netrebko. It allows her to show her coloratura and acting skills. She's having a great time and it's infectious.

Rolando Villazon is often criticized for overacting and, indeed, his flailing about can sometimes be distracting. But here, it perfectly suits Nemorino's comically clumsy pursuit of Adina. Then he puts the comic antics aside and delivers such a nuanced and moving performance of ""Una furtiva lagrima"" that the audience insists on an encore.

It's a wonderful surprise to see the great Verdi baritone, Leo Nucci, as Belcore. His voice is surprisingly light and flexible and he's clearly relishing playing up the sleazy side of the character.

Ildebrando D'Arcangelo (Dulcamara) possesses a beautiful bass baritone voice. (He excels as Leporello on two recent ""Don Giovanni"" DVD's.) He also has a strong stage presence. That charisma and his deep resonant voice, make his duets with the two leads both funny and musically superb.

They sing with too heroic a tone,and don't play with the language enough. If they are SO good-looking why doesn't Adina fall for them and why do they have to resort to selling a ""magic potion""? The staging was just haphazard and I felt they had to make it up on the spot. No matter how much gray they put in his hair, Dulcamara comes off as just too young!
Nucci sings well, but looks too old, particularly with the ill-fitting soldiers costume that does not flatter him. He sings it very well though. Netrebko is beautiful and sings beautifully. Villazon is so lithe and agile and puts so much into the role that I hate to carp about the somewhat muscular ""Una furtiva lagrima"", and the encore just seemed like a planned trick for the DVD.

Rolando Villazon is one of the great tenors of the past 100 years, something that I feel is safe to say even though he has barely reached mid-career (the fates be willing). He is in rare voice throughout this performance and his performance and encore of Una furtiva lagrima are as fine as you will hear of this aria, even from Caruso or Gigli  -- the first time he sings it as a tenore leggiero and the second time as a spinto. You can pick and choose which version you like better, but you can have both. Netrebko is outstanding as Adina. While she has her critics, I find her voice and her acting to be irresistible in general, and this role is hardly ""too big"" for her voice. She gives the role plenty of character, too. The rest of the cast does the buffo business very well. This is a must have performance.",1186272000,15,827,4.267515923566879

I truely loved this opera it was so much a bright up beat production. There is little enough in opera repetoire for the singers to have fun and this is one where the lighter side and sillier side has its day. The addition of the live donkey reminded me of a programme with Birgit Nielsen doing the Ring cycle  and lustily singing for her horse ,the look on her face when the stage hands brought in a real horse was worth its wieght in gold.(needless to say she didn't stop until the horse returned that was it she gave up !!)So who cares if caterpillar eyes are over the top I personnaly found this whole production to be a brilliant piece of musical entertainment with a wonderful cast and some really funny moments",1182038400,10,957,4.172972972972973

We also have several great casts on just CD and almost everyone of them presents an accurate presentation of what the composer asks for.  This is not as easy as it sounds.  Many Traviatas fall short of our expectations; just to name one opera that gets over recorded and not always well.  Now let me be honest and say I don't always enjoy or get into much comic opera; Don Giovanni being an exception. It's really a comedy, tragedy and old fashioned morality play all rolled into one.  Absurd plots and many farces just don't cut it with me.  I took a risk on this DVD just to see and hear Netrebko and Villazon.  I am not disappointed!  This entire cast and production do Donizetti and this opera full justice.  Netrebko is enchanting.  Villazon is unique and special.  He's almost Groucho Marx with a great voice.  His entire face and body is an actor's dream come true and he can sing while being so physically flexible.  His voice strikes my ear as having a little bit of Domingo and DiStefano in it.  The aria ""Una Furtiva Lagrima"" has to be encored and is even slightly better the second time.  After all his comic posturing his straight forward singing here is just a perfect contrast to all that came before.  This DVD should be added to the Battle/Pavarotti and Scotto/Bergonzi if you already own them.  Like I said I'm not the biggest fan of comic opera; yet, this production completely won me over.

Villazon and Netrebko have wonderful chemistry together, and the other principals inhabit their roles with similar gusto and enthusiasm. It's a happy, involving, and touching performance. The camera work is excellent, even showing us the glances between Villazon and the conductor before they repeat ""una furtiva lagrima.""

When Adina finally succumbs to Nemorino's pleas, their reaction to one another nearly sets the stage on fire. The chemistry between them is sensational.

It is clear that they had a lot of fun with this performance and let their own personalities shine through. One reviewer has mentioned the 'unbridled silliness' of Netrebko after her duet with D'Arcangelo - I have seen her performance of I Puritani recently as a video broadcast from the Met... she does the same sort of thing offstage - skipping about and tossing her skirts! It's really rather endearing.

The DVD doesn't offer much more in the way of special features, there is only a short character identification piece offered. And for this price that is just fine. The sound is good.

2550440,5,B000F3T3CS,"Donizetti's enchanting comedy 'L'Elisir d'Amore' has rarely been performed with such panache and sense of fun as this beautiful evening captured during a live performance of the Otto Schenk/Jrgen Roseat production at the Vienna Staatsoper on this sparkling DVD.

Conductor Alfred Eschw enjoys every minute of this bubbling score and the orchestra is especially sensitive to his subtle demands.  The raison d'etre for creating this live recording is obviously the inimitable harmony of the leads Rolando Villazn as Nemorino and Anna Netrebko as Adina.  These two handsome and talented singer/actors share a magnetism that is gracing the opera houses around the world and having seen them before only in dramatic roles on stage, it is rewarding to find they both share a flair for comedy, not only in their interaction with each other but also in their total professionalism of sharing the sense of ensemble. They are a dream match.

It is difficult to imagine a more tenderly sung 'Una furtiva lacrima' (and here the audience obviously agrees, demanding an encore!) than Villazn offers.  But that is one of the highlights everyone expects.  It is the manner of delivery of the entire opera that makes the Villazn/Netrebko duo work such magic.  They are ably supported by the Dulcamara of Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and the Sergeant Belcore of the dependable Leo Nucci.  Sets, costumes, acting, orchestral timbre and of course gorgeous singing make this an opera DVD well worth owning.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, April 07",1175385600,41,1522,5.200819672131147

2550470,3,B000F3T3CS,"One would be hard-pressed to find a more beautifully sung ""L'Elisir..."" these days.  Netrebko and Villazon are both in their prime, and they have never sounded better.  And I doubt there has ever been a more breathtakingly beautiful Adina than Netrebko's.  But I have serious reservations about the way this 1980 Otto Schenk production has been directed.  It's opera buffo, with an emphasis a little too much on the ""buffo"" for me.

The major culprit here is Villazon, who never stops moving and mugging for a single moment.  With his Harpo Marx hair and caterpillar eyebrows, he's a walking cartoon, and he plays the character less as an open, uncomplicated bumpkin and more like the village idiot.  One longs to tie his hands behind his back and yell ""Don't just do something, stand there!""  Thank God he calms down for ""Una furtiva lagrima,"" which is stunningly sung and well deserving of the audience's thunderous ovation.  Interestingly enough, during the encore - yes, he sings it twice; this is a production where more is always considered more - one can see the makings of a marvelous Nemorino: simple, heartfelt and devoid of schtick.

Netrebko is considerably more restrained, except for her Act 2 duet with Ildebrando D'Arcangelo's Dulcamara, which ends in unbridled silliness.  This moment, along with Villazon's anachronistic happy dance in Act 1, is just one example of the way in which the singers have been given free reign to tap into their inner Tim Conways, much to Donizetti's detriment.

I think much would have been gained by Nucci and D'Arcangelo switching roles.  As marvelous as Nucci is - and when is he not? - he's too old for Belcore.  He would have brought a wisdom and wiliness to Dulcamara that is lacking in D'Arcangelo's full-out comic performance.  D'Arcangelo is certainly funny, agile and inventive, but he's too youthful for Dulcamara, despite the fake gray in his hair.  Don't get me wrong, it's a marvelous performance - but it's a marvelous performance of Rossini's Figaro.  I think he would have brought a terrific, droll pomposity to the balloon-headed Belcore.

We should be grateful to have any visual record of four such major talents as Netrebko, Villazon, Nucci and D'Arcangelo.  And it's obvious that the whole enterprise is being presented as nothing more than good, clean, operatic fun.  But I still find more lasting pleasures - and fewer distractions - in two other ideal DVD ""L'Elisir's"": the gorgeous Met production with Pavarotti and Battle, and the updated version with Alagna and Gheorghiu.",1172275200,77,2547,5.004750593824228

He lets his emotion show through and he would have made a wonderful dramatic actor if God had not given him such a beautiful voice.  He is absolutely the greatest thing to come along in opera for a long,long time.  He has me listening to things I thought I never would have condeidered.  Anna Netrebko is very good too although she has a way to come with her voice and control of it.

2550474,5,B000F3T3CS,"To act funny is not easy, and an actor like Schenk knows that. Although originally an actor, Otto Schenk has directed many operas at the Met and elsewhere. This DVD of L'Elisir D'amore, from the Vienna State Opera, directed by Schenk is a masterpiece. You have to watch this DVD several times to appreciate his work. I've never seen a chorus really acting, besides bodies being moved around. The various and different expressions and nuances on the choristers' faces are an intimate part of this production. It takes discipline, patience, leadership, and artistic inspirational insight for any director to accomplish that. The physicality and theatricality of this production, thanks to Schenk's genius, is phenomanal and it shows what opera buffa is all about. With so much action going on, on stage, it's amazing that the charaters not only can act with precision but also can sing without sliding or losing pitch contol. At times, it's difficult to comprehend it, and you may think that the voices are dubbed! Well, what about the quality of singing? L'Elisir D'amore is not a play but an opera after all.
I was fortunate, in the early 70s, to see L'Elisir at the Lyric Opera in Chicago with Pavarotti and Blegen. Pavarotti, the best bel canto tenor in our lifetime, vocally was phenomenal. A purist, that's all he cares about: the voice! In this DVD, the paradigm shift that Netrebko and Villazon have brought to the opera world today is confirmed one more time. Netrebko (Adina) is not only a formidable soprano but also a formidable actress. Villazon (Nemorino) is not only a tenor with an unbelievable clarion but also a great actor. The combination of singing and acting, as this DVD shows, have made Netrebko and Villazon the opera darlings of our time. Since Callas and Gobbi- voice notwithstanding- we have not seen opera singers with the acting capability of Netrebko and Villazon. One reviewer remarked that Villazon is overacting. What do you expect? He is the village idiot who has the hots for the beauty-queen of the village, and who also gets drunk! He's in character to the limit and you feel sorry for him. Nucci (Balcore) may have passed his vocal prime, but he still sings and acts well. D'Arcangelo (Dulcamara) vocally is excellent, and he moves on stage impessively and convincingly. Besides acting, the chorus sings gloriously with control, and adds color and vitality to the village's carefree life. The orchestra is well conducted and compliments Donizzeti's playful and joyous score admirably. Although, acoustically, there is some imbalance between the lead singers and the orchestra, this DVD is a gem and is highly recommended.

2550475,5,B000F3T3CS,"As has been rightly pointed out, the singing of all the principals in this production is first-rate, while as opera performers Villazon and Netrebko are also that great rarity, a stunning couple to look at. Along with just about everyone else on stage or in the audience at this performance, they too appear to be having a whale of a time. Such widespread delight pretty quickly becomes impossible to resist.

If there is a flaw in the performance, however, I'd say it's in the tendency of Villazon once again to overact, a characteristic less seriously distracting here, though, than in his earlier Don Carlo or Alfredo. Amusingly dressed as an ebony mop-haired Raggedy Andy, his Nemorino certainly has enormous charm and largely employs successful comedic stage movement and business, including some unexpected, but marvelous, juggling with real pieces of fruit, but I'd say Villazon finally falls victim to playing the ""cute"" card to excess, even ""mugging"" shamelessly. His perpetually raised, then lowered, bushy eyebrows and his repeatedly furled lower lip decline into mannerisms; he, in turn, threatens to become less a comic actor here than an act.  Now since many opera performers still provide little in the way of acting, I suppose we should be grateful for what he does provide, even if he finally crosses the line into excess. And in any event the flaw is a small one when taken in conjunction with his glorious singing and mostly persuasive acting throughout this role.

At the same time, just because he is potentially such a talented actor as well as an already wonderful singer, a shrewder stage director might have reminded him of Hamlet's famous speech to overly ambitious comic players advising them that in great acting less is usually more.",1169164800,11,1762,5.027397260273973

Netrebko and Villazon were both outstanding in singing and acting and fit their roles perfectly. Although the remainder of the cast was not of their high standard, they were more than adequate.

The performers made it appear that they were thoroughly enjoying themselves.

The staging was traditional and appropriate (although one set was used for all the scenes).

I don't understand Erik Moe's comment that he thought Netrebko was unprofessional in applauding Belcore and Nemorino, Her applause, which was for their actions as characters in the opera (not for their singing) was appropriate for the character of Adina. (Nemorino juggled fruit, not balls as Eric Moe said in his review.)

Netrebko and Villazon are incredible actors and singers, for me surpassing Alagna and Georghiu in the Lyon version. Even though Leo Nucci may be too old for the role, his acting is really superb (we all knew his singing was great)I had never seen him in a comic opera before). In short, we have three of todays greatest stars, so it could not be anything but great. The performance never drags and is really fun to watch, and is also excellently singed.

The only thing which was a bit of a problem for me was the audio, with the sound of the voices varying a bit depending on the location of the singers, which I assume, was due to a not ideal microphones placement. Nevertheless, it was very good in general.

I completely disagree with Mr. Erik remarks about Netrebko's attitude. This is not an opera seria, but an opera buffa, and it's great to see that the singers are having so much fun, which they transmit to the audience.

Apart from the superb performances of Netrebko, Villazon and Nucci, there are also some wonderful performances by the supporting singers, especially Inna Los as Gianetta. The sets and costumes are traditional, as is the staging and lighting. The conductor (Alfred Eschwe) does a more than creditable job of keeping the orchestra alive and paying attention to the singers - balancing the volume of the orchestra to the capability of the soloists/chorus. The chorus is also very good. I would also note the fine acting of Rolando Villazon - he has the comic timing of a Charlie Chaplin (or a Mr. Bean as noted in one of the other reviews) and makes a perfect foil to the character of Anna Netrebko (who is a wonderful actress in her own right). And as a bonus, you get to hear ""una furtiva lagrima"" (Nemorino's 2nd Act aria) twice - the only time in a major opera house recording I have heard an aria encored - wonderful!!!! Even the 2nd Act kiss between Adina and Nemorino gets applause. The audience is highly vested in this performance. Highly recommended.",1522454400,,1141,4.681592039800995

At first blush, I thought this might be a dreaded updated production because it looked like Villazon is wearing a tie on the cover image. Fear not. It's a traditional staging. Villazon is absolutely terrific. His singing is beautiful. The camera work gets the viewer close enough to feel his emotions as he plays a part and appreciates the adoration of the audience.

Netrebko is dazzling. She is a delight and sings this role beautifully. We're lucky to have this on DVD. The pairing of Villazon and Netrebko is perfect. She is beautiful, he is the perfect thwarted admirer. Villazon comes through with a few surprises too. The cast looks like they are having fun performing the entire opera.

Having Leo Nucci in this opera is a huge bonus. I love the man. He brings so much to every role and this is no exception.

Worth all 5 stars available.",1513123200,4,919,4.73125
8116901,5,B000F3T3CS,"This is a great production to watch and listen to. Villazon is both adorable and hilarious in the role of Nemorino. He reminds me of a young Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean), both in physical appearance/mannerism and comic gestures. The singing is wonderful, and Villazon's (and the opera's) showpiece, Una furtiva lagrima, is the best I've ever heard and witnessed (the audience rightly gives him an enormously affectionate ovation, and demands an encore). I never thought I'd say this, but I like it even better than Pavarotti's. Famous arias aside, Villazon's fluid and playful movements, gestures and comic timing are remarkable, and the singing is breathtaking at times. With it's wacky, madcap plot and tuneful, accessible music, this would be a great introduction to opera for those just starting to check out the genre.",1511740800,2,820,5.172932330827067

8116904,5,B000F3T3CS,"I think of this opera more as a broadway musical than an opera. It contains whistleable melodies, lovable characters, a production true to Donazetti's
wishes,an ingenious plot and a HAPPY ending. I've seen other versions, none so pleasant throughout as this. Rolando's juggling and his encore aria make it outstanding as I see it.
I liked it enough to buy 4 copies to give hopefully to friends who have not (yet) discovered the joy in opera.
Do assure yourself that it will feature subscripts.",1480982400,,493,4.880952380952381
8116905,5,B000F3T3CS,"I absolutely love this recording of this opera. These two are just...exquisite together. Rolando Villazn's voice is perhaps my favorite tenor voice (blasphemy in the world where Pavarotti is still seen as God, I'm sure) but his ability to emote vocally just sends shivers up my spine.

And Anna. She was so exceptionally lovely the year this was made. She has such a gorgeous type of voice, a heavier lyric voice that never sounds too cloying or sweet. She's perfect as the cheerfully cruel Adina.

Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is fantastic. Such a great voice, and so amusing in this role. I'm used to seeing him as Don Giovanni, and this was a treat.

Of course, Leo Nucci never disappoints, even at his advanced age.

This opera is one of my favorites, because it's light and happy, and sometimes I want them to end happily ever after, instead of with death and sadness!

I've watched it several times since purchasing, and am so glad I bought it.",1472860800,3,944,4.696969696969697
8116906,4,B000F3T3CS,"Netrebko and Villazon are really charming in this production.  It is a rather simple set and not particularly well directed for video or for sound.  The quality is not blu ray level by a long shot, but it is still a wonderfully entertaining peace,  musically attractive and with gorgeous arias.  I would definitely buy it again.",1468195200,,328,4.803571428571429
