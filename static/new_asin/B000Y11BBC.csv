3011137,4,B000Y11BBC,"Both of these movies are extremely entertaining and suitable for the entire family.  The Apple Dumpling Gang is better than its sequel due to the interactions of all of the major stars.  Susan Clark is excellent as Dusty, and Bill Bixby is wonderful and believable as Donovan.  The children do an excellent job and appear to have good on screen presence.  I would recommend it for children of all ages, including adults who are young at heart.

The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again is good, but it relies more on slapstick than the first movie.  You miss the parts of Dusty and Donovan and the children.  It is also a little confusing that Harry Morgan plays in both productions, but plays two separate characters. They could have said that he was the Justice of the Peace's twin brother or a look alike relative.  Of course he always does an excellent performance in  whatever part he plays.",1216166400,20,891,4.660256410256411

3011231,5,B000Y11BBC,"In my opinion, Tim Conway and Don Knotts are two of the best when it comes to good old fashioned pie in the face sight gags, and
both of these shows have plenty to go around. The original 'Apple Dumpling Gang' has a stronger cast and better story line, involving
Bill Bixby as a gambler tricked into accepting responsibility for three homeless orphans, while 'The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again'
takes the roles created by Conway and Knotts in the first movie and builds the sequel around their continuing miss-adventures. I saw
these movies back when they came out in the theatres, and I watched the DVDs again with my grandsons. Good clean fun for all ages.",1393027200,,660,4.64957264957265

3011253,5,B000Y11BBC,"It's California gold country, and an elegantly attired man rides his horse along a river track with a mournful harmonica in the background. At nightfall, he rides into Quake City, secretly observed by two men up to no good. They pull up their bandanas and attempt to rob the rider - with spectacular lack of success. We've just met Theodore Ogelvie and Amos Tucker (played with hilarity by Don Knotts and Tim Conway) - and two more hapless crooks would be hard to find.

The elegant fellow is Russel Donavan, smooth-talking itinerant gambler (played with heart by Bill Bixby). The next day, for a small payment, he agrees to help out John Wintle, by signing for the valuables Wintle has coming in on the stagecoach. What a surprise for ardent-bachelor Donavan, when the valuables turn out to be Wintle's orphaned kin - three kids! Sheriff/Judge Homer McCoy (Harry Morgan) sets Donavan straight: ""You don't jump another man's claim. You don't steal his wife, woman or whiskey. You don't strike a bargain and then entertain second thoughts about the matter. Any one of these offenses can make you the exalted guest of a hemp party!!""

And the hilarity continues. The kids own half of the Commodore Mine, but it's played out. Or is it? The notorious Frank Stillwell Gang is after the 356 pound nugget in the bank vault. But so are Amos and Theodore, who really don't want to meet Stillwell again, having accidentally shot him in the leg when they worked for him before.

That's the first movie.
The sequel is even funnier, this is laugh out loud stuff. Amos and Theodore are trying to go straight. They saunter into Junction City, on the Wild West plains, and proceed, with the help of their mule, Clarice, to wreck destruction where ever they go. They accidentally join the army at Fort Concho and the army doesn't know what hit it. Hard on their trail is Marshal Woolly Bill Hitchcock, absolutely blazingly hilarious (played by Kenneth Mars) as the boys accidentally shoot both his hands, leave him in a neck brace, nearly burn him alive, and rob him of his sanity.

The Bonus Extras are on the 1st disc, with the 1st movie:

1.  Audio Commentary for 1st movie, recorded in 2003. Commentators are Tim Conway, Don Knotts, Susan Clark (plays stagecoach driver Dusty) and Brad Savage (plays Clovis, the 8 year-old middle child). Susan says that she came in on her day off to watch Knotts and Conway film the firehouse scene, where Amos and Theodore steal a ladder from the firehouse for their bank robbery. Conway says, ""This was a scene that was totally unrehearsed by Don and I.... We just kind of winged it."" It is a testament to their experience and comic genius that they pulled it off. Of course, they had help. As Conway continues, ""This donkey was great. What a great actor.""
And Susan answers one question that I had - she does not do her own whistling!
All in all, I thought this was a great commentary. And don't pass up the separate interview with Tim Conway under ""The Vault"" extra, as he expands on the filming of ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"".
2.  Cartoon ""Two Gun Goofy"" (7 minutes) An animated color cartoon starring Goofy in the Wild West.
3.  The Vault. This is four separate extras. Not counting the time taken to read the printed material, there is about 69 minutes of video.
A. Lost Treasures. ""Studio Lot"" This is a short history of Disney's back lot. They hadn't needed a back lot when they only put out animated films. But the dawn of Disney regular films required outside sets. In 1957, it built its first real set for the ""Zorro"" B&W TV show. Interesting history. The back lot was razed some time ago, to be replaced by office trailers and a gas station.
B. Galleries. This is made up of A. Production stills, B. Biographies of 10 actors in these two movies, C. Advertising, D. A Look Back With the Gang, E. Conversations with Tim Conway, F. Disney's Rootin' Tootin' Cowboy Heroes.
From the biographies, I had forgotten that Don Knotts had his own TV series. ""The Don Knotts Show"" lasted two years 1970-1971.
The ""A Look Back With the Gang"" extra is fun - made up of extra interviews with the commentators and others. Susan Clark mentions that the Apple Dumpling Gang in the 1st movie was actually the three kids. The name is taken from when Donavan took them to dinner and told them they could eat all the apple dumplings they wanted. I had always assumed that Amos and Theodore were the Apple Dumpling gang!
The star of the extras, though, is the Conversations with Conway. He is as funny off-screen as he is on.
C. 1975 Disney Album. This is film clips or photos of 14 highlights of Disney's year. Films like ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" and ""Escape to Witch Mountain"". Cartoons like ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" reissue. TV such as ""The Boy Who Talked to Badgers"". And firsts, like the first America On Parade, a revised Disneyland parade to celebrate the United States Bicentennial.
d. DVD Credits. One page information about firms that worked on the DVD.

Two family favorites and excellent Disney movies.

3011270,5,B000Y11BBC,"The summer camp I went to/worked at had a copy of 'The Apple Dumpling Gang' to show during rainy afternoons.  So I can still pretty much quote the movie verbatim.  I still enjoy it-- Tim Conway and Don Knotts are just hysterical, and now that I know Carey Grant's work better, watching Bill Bixby work in this movie is even more enjoyable.

I tried this out on my preschooler son.  He is now old enough to watch it...and watch it...and watch it...  Nothing really scary, clean dialogue... not even Disney makes them like this anymore.  A real shame.  Some great nostalgia for adults and a great choice for young families.

'The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides again' just capitalizes on the Tim Conway/Don Knotts teamwork... with much less success.  Like all comedy duo movies, the team works better interwoven with a real plot, which in this second movie never really gets going-- most of the time is taken up with the Conway/Knotts business.  They're great together, and Kenneth Mars (Young Frankenstein) does a good job as the insane marshal... but the plot is thin.  It also has too much violence for the under-5s.  This disc will just never get out of its box again.  If I could have purchased The Apple dumpling Gang by itself, I would have.",1307318400,,1241,4.663594470046083
3011271,5,B000Y11BBC,We have movie nights during the summer and I try to find movies that my kids haven't seen and that most of their friends haven't seen.  That typically leaves me looking for movies from the 70s-80s.  I saw both of the Apple Dumpling Gang movies growing up and now I have shared them with my family and they are just as funny as they were when I was a kid.  These are free from bad language and sexual innuendo.  They are full of hysterical antics of the bumbling burglars.  Highly recommended.  This one still gets pulled out and laughed at while some of the others are left collecting dust on the shelf.,1305936000,,603,4.339285714285714
3011272,5,B000Y11BBC,"Typical classic Dinsey movies with classic Don Knotts and Tim Conway slapstick fun.

These two make up the Apple Dumpling Gang. And as you would expect, they can't do much right. In the first movie, Donovan is expecting a package. He's not expecting it to be three young children who have been orphaned and need a home. The old colonel from the tv show mash plays judge in this town and he pushes Donovan to do right by the children. Dusty is a wagon driving lady who usually acts like a tom boy. For some reason she's decided to make sure Donovan does right by those children and to help him as well. With this touch of romance come three kids who get into trouble and two criminals in the Apple Dumpling Gang who bumble along. It makes for a great story.

The second story is less touching and more slapstick. However, that doesn't stop my family from completely enjoying the story.

Both of these movies are classics and classic Don Knotts. They are funny and sweet and enjoyable.

Enjoy.

3245634,4,B000Y11BBC,"Both of these movies are extremely entertaining and suitable for the entire family.  The Apple Dumpling Gang is better than its sequel due to the interactions of all of the major stars.  Susan Clark is excellent as Dusty, and Bill Bixby is wonderful and believable as Donovan.  The children do an excellent job and appear to have good on screen presence.  I would recommend it for children of all ages, including adults who are young at heart.

The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again is good, but it relies more on slapstick than the first movie.  You miss the parts of Dusty and Donovan and the children.  It is also a little confusing that Harry Morgan plays in both productions, but plays two separate characters. They could have said that he was the Justice of the Peace's twin brother or a look alike relative.  Of course he always does an excellent performance in  whatever part he plays.",1216166400,20,891,4.660256410256411

both of these shows have plenty to go around. The original 'Apple Dumpling Gang' has a stronger cast and better story line, involving
Bill Bixby as a gambler tricked into accepting responsibility for three homeless orphans, while 'The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again'
takes the roles created by Conway and Knotts in the first movie and builds the sequel around their continuing miss-adventures. I saw
these movies back when they came out in the theatres, and I watched the DVDs again with my grandsons. Good clean fun for all ages.",1393027200,,660,4.64957264957265

3245750,5,B000Y11BBC,"It's California gold country, and an elegantly attired man rides his horse along a river track with a mournful harmonica in the background. At nightfall, he rides into Quake City, secretly observed by two men up to no good. They pull up their bandanas and attempt to rob the rider - with spectacular lack of success. We've just met Theodore Ogelvie and Amos Tucker (played with hilarity by Don Knotts and Tim Conway) - and two more hapless crooks would be hard to find.

The elegant fellow is Russel Donavan, smooth-talking itinerant gambler (played with heart by Bill Bixby). The next day, for a small payment, he agrees to help out John Wintle, by signing for the valuables Wintle has coming in on the stagecoach. What a surprise for ardent-bachelor Donavan, when the valuables turn out to be Wintle's orphaned kin - three kids! Sheriff/Judge Homer McCoy (Harry Morgan) sets Donavan straight: ""You don't jump another man's claim. You don't steal his wife, woman or whiskey. You don't strike a bargain and then entertain second thoughts about the matter. Any one of these offenses can make you the exalted guest of a hemp party!!""

And the hilarity continues. The kids own half of the Commodore Mine, but it's played out. Or is it? The notorious Frank Stillwell Gang is after the 356 pound nugget in the bank vault. But so are Amos and Theodore, who really don't want to meet Stillwell again, having accidentally shot him in the leg when they worked for him before.

That's the first movie.
The sequel is even funnier, this is laugh out loud stuff. Amos and Theodore are trying to go straight. They saunter into Junction City, on the Wild West plains, and proceed, with the help of their mule, Clarice, to wreck destruction where ever they go. They accidentally join the army at Fort Concho and the army doesn't know what hit it. Hard on their trail is Marshal Woolly Bill Hitchcock, absolutely blazingly hilarious (played by Kenneth Mars) as the boys accidentally shoot both his hands, leave him in a neck brace, nearly burn him alive, and rob him of his sanity.

The Bonus Extras are on the 1st disc, with the 1st movie:

1.  Audio Commentary for 1st movie, recorded in 2003. Commentators are Tim Conway, Don Knotts, Susan Clark (plays stagecoach driver Dusty) and Brad Savage (plays Clovis, the 8 year-old middle child). Susan says that she came in on her day off to watch Knotts and Conway film the firehouse scene, where Amos and Theodore steal a ladder from the firehouse for their bank robbery. Conway says, ""This was a scene that was totally unrehearsed by Don and I.... We just kind of winged it."" It is a testament to their experience and comic genius that they pulled it off. Of course, they had help. As Conway continues, ""This donkey was great. What a great actor.""
And Susan answers one question that I had - she does not do her own whistling!
All in all, I thought this was a great commentary. And don't pass up the separate interview with Tim Conway under ""The Vault"" extra, as he expands on the filming of ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"".
2.  Cartoon ""Two Gun Goofy"" (7 minutes) An animated color cartoon starring Goofy in the Wild West.
3.  The Vault. This is four separate extras. Not counting the time taken to read the printed material, there is about 69 minutes of video.
A. Lost Treasures. ""Studio Lot"" This is a short history of Disney's back lot. They hadn't needed a back lot when they only put out animated films. But the dawn of Disney regular films required outside sets. In 1957, it built its first real set for the ""Zorro"" B&W TV show. Interesting history. The back lot was razed some time ago, to be replaced by office trailers and a gas station.
B. Galleries. This is made up of A. Production stills, B. Biographies of 10 actors in these two movies, C. Advertising, D. A Look Back With the Gang, E. Conversations with Tim Conway, F. Disney's Rootin' Tootin' Cowboy Heroes.
From the biographies, I had forgotten that Don Knotts had his own TV series. ""The Don Knotts Show"" lasted two years 1970-1971.
The ""A Look Back With the Gang"" extra is fun - made up of extra interviews with the commentators and others. Susan Clark mentions that the Apple Dumpling Gang in the 1st movie was actually the three kids. The name is taken from when Donavan took them to dinner and told them they could eat all the apple dumplings they wanted. I had always assumed that Amos and Theodore were the Apple Dumpling gang!
The star of the extras, though, is the Conversations with Conway. He is as funny off-screen as he is on.
C. 1975 Disney Album. This is film clips or photos of 14 highlights of Disney's year. Films like ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" and ""Escape to Witch Mountain"". Cartoons like ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" reissue. TV such as ""The Boy Who Talked to Badgers"". And firsts, like the first America On Parade, a revised Disneyland parade to celebrate the United States Bicentennial.
d. DVD Credits. One page information about firms that worked on the DVD.

Two family favorites and excellent Disney movies.

3245767,5,B000Y11BBC,"The summer camp I went to/worked at had a copy of 'The Apple Dumpling Gang' to show during rainy afternoons.  So I can still pretty much quote the movie verbatim.  I still enjoy it-- Tim Conway and Don Knotts are just hysterical, and now that I know Carey Grant's work better, watching Bill Bixby work in this movie is even more enjoyable.

I tried this out on my preschooler son.  He is now old enough to watch it...and watch it...and watch it...  Nothing really scary, clean dialogue... not even Disney makes them like this anymore.  A real shame.  Some great nostalgia for adults and a great choice for young families.

'The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides again' just capitalizes on the Tim Conway/Don Knotts teamwork... with much less success.  Like all comedy duo movies, the team works better interwoven with a real plot, which in this second movie never really gets going-- most of the time is taken up with the Conway/Knotts business.  They're great together, and Kenneth Mars (Young Frankenstein) does a good job as the insane marshal... but the plot is thin.  It also has too much violence for the under-5s.  This disc will just never get out of its box again.  If I could have purchased The Apple dumpling Gang by itself, I would have.",1307318400,,1241,4.663594470046083

I saw both of the Apple Dumpling Gang movies growing up and now I have shared them with my family and they are just as funny as they were when I was a kid.  These are free from bad language and sexual innuendo.  They are full of hysterical antics of the bumbling burglars.  Highly recommended.  This one still gets pulled out and laughed at while some of the others are left collecting dust on the shelf.,1305936000,,603,4.339285714285714
3245769,5,B000Y11BBC,"Typical classic Dinsey movies with classic Don Knotts and Tim Conway slapstick fun.

These two make up the Apple Dumpling Gang. And as you would expect, they can't do much right. In the first movie, Donovan is expecting a package. He's not expecting it to be three young children who have been orphaned and need a home. The old colonel from the tv show mash plays judge in this town and he pushes Donovan to do right by the children. Dusty is a wagon driving lady who usually acts like a tom boy. For some reason she's decided to make sure Donovan does right by those children and to help him as well. With this touch of romance come three kids who get into trouble and two criminals in the Apple Dumpling Gang who bumble along. It makes for a great story.

The second story is less touching and more slapstick. However, that doesn't stop my family from completely enjoying the story.

Both of these movies are classics and classic Don Knotts. They are funny and sweet and enjoyable.

Enjoy.
Worth the money.",1305763200,,1008,4.491803278688525
3245770,4,B000Y11BBC,Although not the greatest story line but still lots of fun for the family.  Don Knotts and Tim Conway are show stealers in both movies but especially the sequel.,1301443200,,161,4.551724137931035
3245771,5,B000Y11BBC,"I saw these movies as a kid when they first were released in the theater and they still hold up today as clean, family fun.  You know that Don Knotts and Tim Conway had fun making these pictures as they are hilarious.  These are two films that the entire family can enjoy and adults don't have to be stuck with a dumb G rated movie.  These films are classic Knotts/Conway at their finest.",1300320000,,388,4.287671232876712
3245772,5,B000Y11BBC,I LOVED this movie as a child.  I was thrilled when we found it at our local library and my oldest son (6) also loved it.  I decided to get our own copy and it's fun to listen to him giggle as he watches it.  Even my 4 year old son watches this movie and he won't normally watch any TV shows or movies.,1293840000,4,302,3.6875

3245775,5,B000Y11BBC,"Without hesitation I show this to whatever group of kids I have that need a movie.  It is funny, silly, and clean.  Never has a parent given a negative reaction when they learn their kids have seen this--they usually laugh because they saw it at a kid!!! :)  I am not a ""movie"" person but this one is a sure winner!  there is enough action happening that even second language kids enjoy and get something out of this one.",1270857600,,421,4.291139240506329
