This one has good technique but I need to know how to massage all parts of the body since I am not a pro and only learning so I can give my wife good massages.",1352332800,5,308,4.15

8355053,5,B0027R07SO,"Kathy has put together the best information in this DVD, I have learned so much from the demonstrations and most importantly, I have learned that my thumbs are not really what I should be using....which is excellent news to me!!

Everyone needs this DVD in order to learn the ""right"" way of doing a massage, as well as the ""right"" way of receiving one!!

It says that this was made for the beginner, which is everyone who doesn't have this to learn with!!

Very well put together, and definitely something everyone will benefit from!!

Thank you so much Kathy!!",1241136000,6,561,4.636363636363637
