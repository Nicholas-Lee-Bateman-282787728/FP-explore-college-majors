7894487,2,6305789142,"The final part of the story sees all of the storylines nicely come to an end (and some new beginnings).  It's a happy, almost anti-climatic ending but it seems quite realistic and leaves you with a warm feeling.
Possible spoilers...
Chapter Ten -- Bath Time For Two
One of the more risque episodes.  Touma takes a bath and Urara, to cheer him up, uses her talents and washes his back.  Touma goes to take the entrance exam and asks to exchange hairs with Urara for good luck.  Urara, being the ultimate cheerleader, stands outside the exam window holding up a sign that reads ""Go For It!""
Chapter Eleven -- Testing Student Syndrome
Touma ends up failing the test and commits himself to studying harder.  Mashu, through some investigation finds out that Touma isn't a Keio student and tells Mieko.  Touma runs into Erika his ex and stands his ground and admits he's a cram student, rather than feeling ashamed. Urara gives Touma a love note and Mieko thinks of Touma and his lie.  Urara's uncle calls up and Touma finds out that he's not away on a business trip but that he really lives in Italy.  He realizes that he shouldn't be living with Urara.
Chapter Twelve -- A Testing Student's Decision
Touma decides to leave the apartment.  In this final episode you see all of the characters.  At a baseball game Akimota tells Touma that he still needs to establish his identity.  Kieko and Mashu discuss there pride and how they're living for their parents dreams.  Urara is sad that Touma's moving out.  Mieko calls her boyfriend up and tells him that she's met someone who lives his life to the fullest -- she calls off their wedding.  Touma ends up moving in with Akimota.",1069804800,,1671,4.601351351351352
7894488,3,6305789142,"Poor Urara, well, I have to say that I was happy with this one until I saw the ending.. (sigh).. The first episode with the famous (boobs and bathtub) scene was hilarious, and I laughed outloud a lot watching this one. This last DVD was very good compared to the others in the series.  At least they didn't stretch it out too long, otherwise it would have been even more of a let down.
I have very mixed feelings towards this series. I get sexually frustrated watching it. It promises more, but all you get is turned down, just like Urara. Tonma is a big chicken who doesn't seem to have a clue..
I recommend watching this in both languages, I found that I enjoyed it more in Japanese. A lot of the jokes weren't the same, and they added more of a raunchy and stupid persona to Tonma. He is a little smarter in the Japanese version and this is seen in the bathtub scene.  Over all, if you've come this far and need the last one to finish, I suggest you do. It only gets better from the third one.
The depressing ending will leave you with an empty feeling. But this can be remedied by thinking of other more fulfilling series, like Trigun or Outlaw Star.
Enjoy!",997833600,5,1161,4.2727272727272725
7894489,4,6305789142,"No! It can't end! I need more! Well, anyway, the ending to SAkura Diaries wasn't as big and spectacular as I was hoping for. There were some nice scenes like the one in the bathroom with Urara and Touma, but it could have been better. This final tape wraps up Touma's love and school life. It was done fairly well, but there was so much more that could have made it more enjoyable. We can only hope that there will be a sequel (hey, I can dream, can't I?). I just love this show though. Its on a level with Ranma 1\2, but at the same time not being a hentai. And this tape also shows SD at its full adult humor. Very few shows are capable of that (well, maybe ""Maze"", but that show ......). Anyway, I urge you to see the final conclusion. Its no big ending, but its still a great one. Come on, U-Jin. Shows us more!",981158400,,815,4.068322981366459
7894490,4,6305789142,"I am very sad that Sakura Diaries is over, and even more sad at the ending they gave this great series.  Nothing seemed complete at the end and I wished there was more than what U-Jin gave.
Also these episodes are a little more adult (while never hentia) in their nature.  The whole bathroom scene is a perfect example.  Plus alot of great things that could have happened didn't.
To be honest I did like this tape I just don't think it concluded the series very well.  I wish U-Jin would have made more, but I guess he didn't.  Well until next time.",979862400,,549,4.29126213592233
7894491,5,6305789142,Wow i thought this movie was so so funny i think for anyone who likes Ramma 1/2 will just love Sakuras Diaries (any chapter i got em all) this movie has a little sex (but nowa days what shows doesn't) so not much more then u whou see on TV so u really should get this movie ^^,971049600,,276,3.7758620689655173
7894492,5,6305789142,"I can say it is simply great animation movie! Do you know Yu-Jin. He is very famous adult cartoonist. Many people may not know him. But if you like  Japanese anime, you must have ever seen angel or New angel.
If you  already know Yu-Jin, you might expect something on Sakura Diaries. But  There are no sexual intercourse scenes in Sakura Diaries. Are you  disappointed? You do not need to be appointed. Although it does not contain  sexual story, it can make you feel it is very sensual anime.
The story is  as follows; Touma begin to think of Urara's love and how he is selfish. But  he still can not forget Meiko. Meiko, who is ver agressive and sexual, know  that Touma have been pretended as a college boy of Keio Univ. The mind of  Meiko leave from Touma....poor boy. But Urara is still there. Her love the  to poor boy is unchanged! He decide to accept Urara's love and concentrate  on the entrance exam of University.
This is conventional tri-angle love  story. This is chapter you can see the special service of Urara with soup  in order to cheer up Touma. Do you want to know the Jinx of Touma? His  solution to get rid of Jinx is very sensational! Poor Urara! She do  everything for him.
Opening and ending Music are great. It looks like to  watch opening and ending of Games. Just pick and see it! It is simply  humorous and sexual without sexual intercouse scenes...",965692800,6,1378,4.448
