it is useful and (with this flick)enjoyable to speculate about
what the results would be.

155408,5,0792845900,"One of my favorite movies, based on an H.G. Wells short story.  I only wish I could find this on DVD, but tape is OK.  This is a clean, sharp, bright reproduction version.  I highly recommend this movie.",1199664000,4,203,4.2894736842105265
155409,4,0792845900,"A quirky British comedy wherein the Olympian gods grant miraculous powers to a nebbish from Essex, one Mr. Fotheringay, who at first is quite modest in his use of reality-bending, and eventually succumbs to the temptations of (near) absolute power.  The prewar concerns of war, peace and the polite class politics of the UK are at the heart of this film; nice cameo by Ernest Thesiger (of James Whale horror film fame) as Mr. Maydig, a Bertram Russell-style swords-into-plowshares peacenik intellectual who is as quickly seduced by the lure of ultimate power as are his Establishment counterparts.  Odd film; worth checking out.",1041897600,7,628,5.147058823529412
155410,3,0792845900,"Roland Young fudges his way nicely through any movie, but to imagine him as a vindictive man with unwieldy power is a bit of a stretch.  Ralph Richardson, another man who seemingly can do no wrong, is badly miscast as the threatened retired British officer who becomes flummoxed when his weapons collection is transformed to ploughshares by the title character Young.  The movie has a bright attitude, very spry, but the story is tired and the characters aren't able make up for it.  A nice conceit but with nothing much to say in the end, other than, ""Power draws calamity, well-intentioned or not.""",986860800,,600,4.805825242718447
155411,5,0792845900,"This is an interesting and very entertaining film, which still holds up well after more than 60 years.  The angels decide to bestow miraculous powers upon a common, little man.  He can make things change, move, appear, or disappear at will.  In addition to providing for some very comedic episodes, it raises some though-provoking questions as to the use of such power.
The special effects are executed quite well, and one can only speculate as to what a remake would be like, given today's cutting edge special effects technology.  But don't wait for the remake; this film is well worth seeing.",969494400,10,595,4.861386138613861

7792520,5,0792845900,"Good performances by Roland Young and Ralph Richardson. Look for young George Sanders. Beautiful fantasy story about
a clerk who gets every power he wants. But what to do? Very funny, but also thoughtful. What would I do to make the world
better? Very amusing.",1400889600,2,260,4.8
7792521,4,0792845900,I liked this old film. It kind of reminded me of one man who could do anything and the people who wanted a piece of him til he decided to want something back.  a good lesson storyline.,1392940800,,184,3.972972972972973
7792522,5,0792845900,"The gods discuss giving the power of miracles to all humans.  A test subject is chosen.  It shows how absolute power gaggles the mind of an average human and he goes cosmic with the power.  Roland Young is perfect as the ordinary man who gains power as a gift  from the gods and acts out the power. The curious part of the storyline is that as the man who works miracles, Young takes control  to right the wrongs that men in power on the earth have created. But he has no scientific knowledge that would curb his excess use of power.  He is unaware of  repercussions and so causes disaster.  And then he has the presence of mind to delete the power of miracles and prevent damage to the whole earth by preventing  the incident from happening in the first place. Later Roland Young is the star of 'Topper' and is perfectly cast.",1377993600,3,827,4.352941176470588
7792523,4,0792845900,"This amazing classic was made in '36 and butchered in a re-make by Jim Carrey. See the original, with a screen play and script by H.G. Wells...yes THAT H.G. Wells. If you are not a fan of Roland Young, you will be. Great cast and special effects for that period. Ralph Richardson later Sir Ralph, is wonderful playing an old colonel at only 36. This film is about an innocent and rather meek clerk, who is given all power as a heavenly experiment. (Note the first appearance of George Sanders as one of the angels.  God does not appear in this version.  Thank God..)  The angels debate about power and finally decide to give all power to one person to see the effect on the human spirit.  At first, George is puzzled and bemused, while doing parlor tricks for his friends.  He seeks guidance and becomes a tool of ambitious men who try to use him for their own business or social ambitions.  The old colonel who is a local power, sees him as a threat to his way of life and finally tries to kill him.  That drives George over the edge and he becomes a raving megalomaniac who attempts to remake the world in his own image and to his liking.  He gathers the leaders of the word to his huge new palace and orders them to create a new world to please him or Ill wipe you out as a child wipes a slate.  The Jim Carrey version has him looking for sex and success while mugging and over-acting obnoxiously.  Young underplays the bumbling George Fotheringay until he transforms into the ruler of the world, who is so transfixed by his own power, that he forbids the sun to set, until he has the world that he wants. Watching Roland Young is a treat.  The Topper films were created for him. If you don't know his workyou should. I won't spoil it for you by telling you how it ends.  I wish someone would restore this film and issue it on DVD. Right now only poor bootlegs and copies are available. Worth seeing in any form",1357776000,4,1914,4.3008356545961
7792524,5,0792845900,"I watched this film with childlike wonder when I was very young.  I had discovered H.G. Wells, and suddenly he's screenwriter.  This is one of the delightful, logical fantasy as you watch this simple man deal with the Power of the Gods.  Everyone has an opinion on what he should do and ignore the consequences of his actions.  Watch for a very young George Sanders.  If you love a good story with a whimsey beautifully crafted into a story that teaches a lesson about what total power does to one man.  One of those rare great films written by the famous author we all know",1333670400,2,574,4.419047619047619
7792525,5,0792845900,"I like old movies and this is just a good one.  No sex, gore, killing, or real violence, but thought provoking and a good story.  Well acted for its time.  be sure to have some popcorn and cold coke for this one.",1285804800,3,212,4.0
