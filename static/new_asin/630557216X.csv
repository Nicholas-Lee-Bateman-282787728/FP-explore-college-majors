7891678,3,630557216X,"This isn't really a bad DVD release, but it is on the low end of the quality material expected from National Geographic.  The heavy metal music blaring over MTV-style edits of tornadoes and lightning storms occasionally dips into the murky waters of the worst of reality TV programming about disasters.  Ditto the black-and-white recreations of tragedy a la Rescue 911.  Techniques like these are used mostly during sections about disasters that don't get caught on tape as often, but it's still annoying.
The feature is only 55 minutes in length, but the DVD contains two extra programs, both around 20 minutes long (one on lightning strikes and one on tornadoes and storm chasers).  They are both interesting and somewhat informative...in fact, I liked the program about tornadoes better than the feature.
And, while I do expect National Geographic to produce a more top-shelf product with a little more substance, the 5.1 audio and the crystal clear picture produces a treat for your senses. This release is definately designed to entertain rather than inform.",1005609600,23,1063,5.127167630057803
7891679,5,630557216X,"I owned this on VHS. So when it came out on DVD, I just had to get it. National Geographic has always done an excellent job on their documentries. Natures Fury is a good example. The picture clarity is what  you would expect on a DVD. The sound quality makes the tornadoes and  booming thunder sound like it is in the room. If you like to chase violent  storms or enjoy watching these wonders of nature, waste no time and buy  this DVD!",954806400,17,436,4.216867469879518
