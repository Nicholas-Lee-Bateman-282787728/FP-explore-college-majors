(theasylum.cc)

Starring Jeff Denton (interviewed), Shaley Scott( soon to be interviewed).

Leigh Scott ( writer & director) brings us his version of the someone who you need to pass by  and not stop for.

This movie was scary and suspenseful. That said , It has some ugly moments with sheer violence and sending the wrong message towards female abuse.

Denton plays the bad guy and has major problems with women, Jeff has played flaming genteels(Pirates Of Treasure Island) and good guys( Beast of Bray Road),This time NOT NICE !We have labeled Denton with JAMES DEAN look, This film is something DEAN may have tried if time and car error had been kinder.

Shaley Scott , Is known for her singing and this film proves she can act too. We felt she was really given a opportunity to shine and that is very rare for your first effort on screen with lines. She is also featured on the box art, Which again is quite a kudo.

The violence is very real seeming, Especially the gun play has a gritty hurt- producing effect.

The ending is questionable for effect, I hate red herring stuff, But the female hero made it all work .",1172361600,6,1144,4.596059113300493

8168260,4,B000MEYK9G,"I love good horror/suspense movies!  This one made both my hairs stand up, and I was happy with it.  It had enough 'scare factor' to keep me riveted on the film, and the 'plot' worked out pretty well for the nature of the film.  I was not disappointed in this, at all.",1432080000,,268,4.115384615384615

8168263,4,B000MEYK9G,This actually is a very good movie. The acting is well above average and the killing scenes though not overly gory do look very believable. There is a lot of suspence and a pretty good story as well. So the cover might make you think it's more of a splatter fest when it actually is more of a tense thriller with some mild gore and sprinkled with a little rape. But look at it this way; splatter fest movies are a dime a dozen and not hard to find - this turned out to be an unexpected and good find for me.,1207094400,2,507,3.980392156862745
8168264,1,B000MEYK9G,"To be honest, I went into this movie believing it was the ""Hitcher"" which I take responsibility for that as being my fault.  So given that, I was expecting a lot.  The first two lines of the movie made me realize I had just purchased probably one of the worst low budget movies ever to have been created.  The acting was TERRIBLE!!  The worst part was the sound quality.  No lie, I had to learn how to read lips.  I had  the volume up full blast and there were times, I could not hear a word that was said.  I want to know how this film could be sold!  Overall, I would have fell asleep on it, but it was so bad I wanted to see if it could get any worse!  Well, it never let me down in that aspect.  Take the first review with a grain of salt, as the reviewer must have been the writer himself.  Avoid like the plague!",1192320000,5,818,3.950920245398773
8168265,4,B000MEYK9G,"I never heard of any of these actors but I believed them in the movie. The story line was excellent. The gore wasn't over the top in an effort to cover bad acting or a lame story line. This movie uses suspense and dread to build its atmosphere. And it uses mental instability, rape and violence to keep us glued to our seats. It acheives what the ""Hitcher"", ""RestStop"", ""I Know What you Did Last Summer"" and others of this ilk have failed to do. It actually scares you. I have added this movie to my horror collection next to two of its worthy peers: ""The Devils Rejects"" and ""Last House on the Left"".",1177027200,5,601,4.280701754385965
8168266,2,B000MEYK9G,"I rented this because it had a cool cover and thought it would have some good gore. It starts out good, but it just got dumb middle to the end. The nudity isn't anything special. The gorest parts are when a guy gets shot in the head and blood gets on a white door. The shootout at the end was laughable. They shoot pistols and a shotgun and it takes like 2 seconds to hit something. This reminded me of Rest Stop since that had an awesome cover and had potential, but totally sucked.

I just noticed that The Asylum made this, but it looks like a Lionsgate movie.",1174435200,5,563,4.165137614678899
