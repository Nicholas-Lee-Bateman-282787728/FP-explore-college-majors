I have also read and strongly recommend Strategic Organizational Learning and Strategic Organizational Change by Dr. Michael Beitler.  Well done Dr. Beitler!",1300060800,2,346,6.040816326530612

Buy it along with Beitler's ""Strategic Organizational Change.""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strategic-Organizational-Change-Second-Edition/dp/0972606424/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strategic Organizational Change, Second Edition</a>

7794493,5,0972606440,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This video is far superior to the Stanford videos in both content and production quality, and it cost a lot less. I recommend this video (DVD) along with Beitler's book, Strategic Organizational Change."" Both are very practical.",1217116800,,264,5.162790697674419
7794494,5,0972606440,"This video is great for anybody who must lead a group of people through organizational change. Beitler's guidance is very practical. I was able to apply what I learned on the DVD immediately. I was very frustrated with the level of resistance my people had toward recent changes. Beitler help me understand why they were resisting and what to do about.

I have purchase several Stanford University videos that are three times the cost and not nearly as helpful. The production quality, graphics, and material covered on Beitler's video are excellent.
