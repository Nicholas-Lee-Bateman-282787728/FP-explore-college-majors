994077,3,6305238065,"Five strangers (Quentin, Worth, Holloway, Rennes, and Leaven) wake up in an unfamiliar room dressed in generic clothing. The room has a hatch on each wall, the floor, and the ceiling. They have no idea where they are or how they got there or why they are there. No common denominator between them explains why they would all be abducted. Together, they have to work together to figure out how this building works and how to get out of it.

Cube is a mixed bag of a movie. The best thing about it is the concept and the limited view of this world. The cube is a huge building and its location is never known. Rooms move at measured intervals and come in five different colors. Some rooms are completely innocuous while others have elaborate traps, including acid spray and deadly wires. Between each hatch is a series of numbers. The people have to band together and find out how this place works. Are the colors significant? What do the numbers signify? Trial and error can prove fatal, but it's a necessary evil when there are no guides or indications as to how to solve the puzzle. This mystery is compelling throughout the film and the sets are ingenious in their simplicity.

The characters have nothing in common and bring different abilities to the table. Rennes has escaped seven prisons before, which makes sense why he's there. Quentin is a police officer, giving him an air of authority whether deserved or not. Holloway is a clinic doctor. Leaven is a math student who works out most of the number puzzles. Worth is an architect. Kazan is a mentally challenged man that proves to have an uncanny ability with numbers to help Leaven. This diverse cast gives rise to differing opinions on how to proceed and rising tensions as the plot goes on. All of the characters are named after prisons, coloring the story as a critique of prisons and driving the Kafkaesque themes.

Cube is a high concept film that goes beyond its low budget. The fact that only one room was actually builtThe aspect that keeps me from loving this movie is the acting. All of the acting is pretty mediocre, but Quentin is the absolute worst. His shorthand for intensity is bulgy crazy eyes and shouting erratically. It made dramatic scenes laughable and destroyed the atmosphere at times. Other than that, Cube is a memorable film with a justified cult following.",1514505600,,2345,4.673123486682809

994161,5,6305238065,"As a lifelong horror fan, I remember back in the 90s when my old high school friend called me up and told me this was about to air for the first time on the Sci-Fi (now SyFy) channel.  I knew I had to catch it no matter what.  The premise was so awesome to me at the time as a college kid home from school and I'd never heard of anything like it before (never caught the Twilight Zone episode I see a lot of people are alluding to here, but now I may have to - thanks!).  Call this horror, psychological thriller, Sci-Fi...just watch it and thank me later.

My first film watched by director Vincenzo Natali and it made me want to watch everything else he's done, too.  He may have equalled this with the Sci-Fi espionage film Cypher, but for my money, if only because I watched it first, Cube will always be #1.  Much better than the sequels, since they seem to suffer from a ""more is less"" phenomenon.  If they'd been made with better budgets, they may have provided a satisfying, thrilling exploration of the larger world.  And I did enjoy the movies as a Cube fanboy, don't get me wrong.  But with a world as deep and rich as this franchise could have been, its hard to do it justice with ""SyFy channel"" film budgets.  I also don't think Natali was involved anymore at that point.  So it kinda got out of his hands, kinda like the Saw franchise ended up out of the hands of original creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell (and call me crazy, but I see the parallels between the Saw and Cube franchises, so is it possible this movie heavily influenced the Saw movies?  I'd say its definitely possible.  I think the first gets unfairly called ""torture porn"" where it was really more psychological thriller like this or 7even).

So while I know some people are dissatisfied with the ending where not much if anything is explained, I think that's actually what made the movie so special and different.  A Hollywood big budget production would have probably sucked the soul right out of this thing and explained everything.  So thank God for indies.  So I'll just say ""I like the Blue Room"" and leave it at that :)  Anyway, if you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494892800,,2234,4.394160583941606
994162,4,6305238065,"In this psychology sci-fi tinged thriller a group of disparate persons awake to find themselves alone in a futuristic tech room that is shaped like a cube, with each side possessing a door that leads to another cube. As they traverse the color-coded rooms some people meet their demise through deviously lethal, sadistic almost Saw-like traps in certain unsafe rooms while the main core of characters ends up pooling together as they accidentally come across each other. They must work together to survive and escape the cube but also to keep from going mad and, perhaps, killing each other off.

The premise for Cube is sound in its intrigue: what do people who are psychologically intact (for the most part) but without a connected history to each other do when their world is stripped away and they are confronted with their mortality and the seemingly possible chance to prolong their lives if they solve a riddle? Cube satisfies on this level though some horror fans may be disappointed that this is overall light on the gore and spacious between the death sequences. But Cube is more than its intriguing premise--it tries to be a social satire while thinking that maybe it expresses some real (nihilistic) profundity. It is here that Cube falters as it often feels that it was written by a collegiate who is developing their writing in a creative writing class, especially when it comes to some of the back-and-forth dialogue between the characters. The actors are game but at times also unconvincing. This could have been a brilliant movie with some careful edits and clean-up of the dialogue with a more natural interchange (and some good actors in the roles). But its still entertaining and worth a watch.

For those who will debate the ending and the metaphor(s) of the movie, or the social criticisms it seems to be making, my personal take on the end of the film is that only the pure (as defined by the filmmakers as those who don't have the clear capacity for deception due to their mental health limitationswe see this clearly in Forrest Gump! and our pure person in the Cube is an adult autistic man-boy) shall see heaven/ escape hell. I found the ending of the film frustrating for several different reasons, but you can certainly take it differently than I have as its really open to interpretation. As far as the social criticisms its interesting to me that it both distrusts and excuses the abusiveness of authority; the Cube may be a metaphor for life in general but I think that the writer was suggesting a distrust in how power, specifically as ensconced in technology and technological progress to improve and/or control our lives, can get away from us in a way that we create our own living hell. Hey, were screwed and its no one persons fault because its all of our faults collectively! Power as authority is excused in this sense because it is an impersonal after-effect. But, again, you can find many different meanings in the film which is a fun aspect of this feature. The main character, Quintin, is a cop who initially galvanizes the disparate and disrupted group toward survival but ends up being their biggest threat as his biases and urges to keep power only accentuate his descent into madness. His character epitomizes divested power and the writers distrust in authority on a more personal level. Its sad to see the cop portrayed as the bad guy. The actor who plays Quintin seriously overacts at times and that doesnt help the cause (or does it?).

Id love to see this film lovingly parodied on MST3K!",1494720000,,3539,4.769983686786297

It's just a really good piece of imaginative filmmaking that works on the humanity of its characters despite the alien environment. It's got suspense, moments of gore, an intelligent use of mathematics and a reliably terrific performance by David Hawlett for any fellow Gaters out there.

With less blatant reoccurring gore, although there is a smattering of gruesome stuff, it's perhaps less focused on torture shock than others in it's class, more suspenseful psychological mystery. Overall I liked this film, it was entertaining and the various twists and turns were not entirely obvious before hand. The cast was good, the acting was good to passable, the plot was good. The main flaw was the immediate manufactured animosity or alliance between various characters...something that these types of survival films can't really do without to establish tension. Of course it's a key component in pretty much every story...basically drama 101. The janitor hates the rich business man or whatever obligatory racial/religious/class aspect suits the story. The depth (or lack) of this interpersonal aspect is often what defines a well written one from mediocre or bad. Can you identify with one or any of these characters, or at least have a notion of what motivates them to be at each others throats if you disagree or not, or see the absurdity of it? This is where things go mediocre simply because there seems to be an awful lot of hatred appearing out of thin air, much of it lacking plausible sincerity...or even much basis at all in reality. Rather shallow in it's execution of cliche character flaws, associated with societal segments, the cop, the doctor, the genius, the engineer, the autistic. Somebody has to hate somebody for this to be interesting, get that going fast! They appear one dimensional for the most part in doing so.

I like to imagine the original pitch meeting for the movie Cube, in some big fat cat Toronto producer's office, Andr Bijelic's uncle and Vincent natal in an ill-fitting suit acting as his nephews agent (this is pure satirical speculation on my part), talking to David ""Hammerhead"" Schmitz, one of Toronto's biggest producers and taste makers, the guy who runs interference for Cronenberg when he's in town. Uncles Bjielic ""It's like the Matrix, but for Canada, with a unique twist of post-9/11 paranoia available only from the region of which Paula Poundstone once said, 'I always thought of you guys as America's hat.' Plus, it will feature our unique talent resources such as Maurice Dean Wint's vast reserves of dramatic over-emoting and David Hewlett proving that he is capable of embodying 76 different varieties of dramatic apathy, plus occasionally Nicole DeBoer will take a break from looking adorable to give voice all sorts of strange festering animosities that the average moviegoer didn't realize still exists in the hearts of advanced math majors everywhere with lines along the lines of: ""Duh, it means you're no good at math."" And all with a weirdly torture porn twist at the end...Bud, I'm seeing, ten, twelve years down the road this is going to be known as Canada's TRON, Disney will be begging to buy the rights, Marvel crossover, it'll be brilliant.""
And years later here's Uncle Biejelic all decked out in swag he bought off  the Cube Zero & Hypercube sitting at the edge of a pool with Bruce Boxleitner negotiating the rights for a combined TRON/Cube reboot prequel and that is my Aliens Vs Predators you are describing there.

996032,5,6305238065,"What's cooler than a booby trapped box that kills people? Well folks, not much.

Science fiction fans can rejoice, for a savior has come. The eternal well of science fiction, alien goodies, robotic creatures, and enlarging blobs has been drying up for some time; it's the perfect moment to inject some freshness into the contaminated air and clear our nasals of stinky, polluted trash. A film has finally arrived to do just that. And guess what else, on top of all this, star gazed fans? It's an original idea too!

As miraculous as it is to state anything as 'original' now of days, this one is something I've never seen or read about before. Five people wake up in a room with four openings on each side. They have discovered that if you venture off into the wrong room, something morbidly horrible kills them. Be it acid in the face, dissolving bacterais, fires, you name it, it's not something they look forward to. Of the five folks, one is an expert convict who is notorious for breaking out of things. Another is a teenage girl math whiz, another an activist woman, another an ex cop with a chip on his shoulder, and another a plain guy that doesn't stand out in my head. None of them remember how they arrived there, and none of then know, at first, how the hell they're going to sruvive this rat trap and break back into freedom and normalcy.

Soon they, or what's left of 'they', begin to discover the secrets of the cube. Through dangerous trial and error that's always costly, they slowly manuever their bodies through the obstacle, running into others - whether alive or dead - that may aide or hurt their journeys progress. One thing's for sure - this movie has more layers than the world's biggest onion. I was kept on my toes for the entire duration, practically spinning in my seat.

Suspense? Of course it's there. Any time they entered a room you waited for the inevitable horror to strike o else tranquil calm to greet them. Would the people I grew to care about be diced into mincemeat and then swept aside with an electronic hand, or would they live to see another room? To top it all off, there is the natural tension among the group. They reminded me of a small pack of trapped animals, getting tired, getting hungry, desperate and suspicious. If you enjoy claustrophobic movies, it's easy to conclude that seeing a bunch of strange stuck in a cube is a very tight fit indeed!

If, and when, death occurs, its always brutal. If I were in the shoes of the survivors, I may just end up sitting there and choosing to stave to death instead of risking those possible fates. Must be the wimp in me. You get some nasty, graphic, gruesome, icky, violent stuff that's sure to make the viewer shrink from the screen adn thank God they're in their own living rooms instead of inside with those unlucky sops.

The acting doesn't come from a very well known cast, which in a way helps. It's potent for being low budget. Each holds their own weight just fine considering how much was dished out to them, adding to the tension and drama. Nicole de Boer as the braniac kid seems a bit snobby at first but does a special sort of job for the flick. Having to play such a tension filled part, she did very well. Nicky Guadagni is Helen, the activist doctor; her motivations and reactions are completely believable. Maurice Dean Wint  will most likely stand out more than the others in the end, not only because of his great acting, but also because he is one of the more interesting characters around. David Hewlett as the plain jane type of guy does what he can with a part that just isn't as interesting as the others. He's a savior of sorts and a stand up kind of guy you have to like, but the most forgettable of the group. Andrew Miller as the autistic was so convincing I thought he must really be like that in real life. Great acting there! His character adds a  unique twist to the whole deal.

The beginning starts off with a man dying a horrible death and then jumps into a mysterious labyrinth that is intriguing, fascinating, confusing, and ultimately horrifying. The ending is  grim, final, and a slight bit of a shocker. The pace never slows down and the film itself always demands attention, from start to finish.

Vincenzo Natali did an amazing job of directing, as it comes across perfectly bleak, dark, and serious. Cinematography was done on a low budget but it looked amazing.

Can I think of anything negative to say concerning this mind-bending obstacle course? Frankly, not really. The acting is good, the plot is damn good, the deaths are cool and not overdone for the sake of being overdone (in other words, they fit), tension is there, action, drama, and intelligence - something sorely missing from many movies now of days.

In short, make sure you see this science fiction/horror head case before the year is out. I took too long to view the damn thing, even after being told I should way before now. I'm glad it's finally been see as I now have another favorite to add to the shelves.

996139,3,6305238065,"I liked this film because I found the story line to be somewhat unique in today's horror film genre.  Actually, it's a remake of an old Twilight Zone episode(#79, season 1.  Five Characters in search of an Exit"").  They've expanded the complexity of the trap and developed the charaters, but it's basicly the same story.  Five people wake up in a type of prison.  They don't know how they got there or why.  They must find a way out before they die of starvation.
What I liked about the film is overshadowed by what I didn't like about it, the antagonist.  There is one charater who becomes increasingly aggressive and violent to the point where he is difficult to watch and frankly, destroys the ending.  It seems like the author(s) had a good idea and ran out of steam half way thru.  The rest of the charaters interact to learn eachother's talents which they must utilize to stay alive and attempt escape.  Everyone present has a role to play to this end.  This part of the film is well done and interesting.

996203,4,6305238065,"The Cube(released Sept/97)is a wonderful Canadian production,starring Nicole De Boer(Dax in DS9),Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin,Nicky Guadagni as Dr. Helen Holloway,David Hewlett as David Worth,Andrew Miller as Kazan,Wayne Robson as Rennes(One Magic Christmas,as the guy who hijacks the children),and Julian Richings as Alderson. It is a grand study in paranoia,fear of the unknown and human beings reduced to the simplest of equations in so far as their emotional stability goes. It is instinctual and at times raw and unnerving to watch as the group`s numbers dwindle and they spiral ever downwards within themselves.
The film begins as an unknown man is lying on a floor in a square/cubed room. He gets up,takes a few steps then is sliced and diced by a swift moving steel metal sieve. He literally falls to pieces before our eyes. It is certainly a disturbing harbinger of what is to come. The film progresses to introducing us to a group of individuals who eventually all come together,and work on a way of trying to get out of their strange dilemma. They put forth their own personal theories as to the whys of their predicament,ranging from an alien kidnapping to a government run conspiracy. Among the group there is a doctor,an ex con,a cop,a student,an autistic savant and one of the actual creators of part of the structure they now stand in. He apparently worked on the outer shell,and was in communication with others working on the project,but none knew what the ultimate design was nor the others names.
The student utilizes her math skills to get the group going from one safe room to another,as each are numbered and some rooms are booby trapped. Time passes on and the group starts to dwindle and tempers flare and extreme paranoia and fear touches each one in different ways. They eventually learn they are all in a giant cube,with a myriad of other cubes that constantly move. They also figure out that the original cube they started from was the one they should have stayed in in the first place. They get back to that location,and in time the room comes to a halt at a portal that they may escape from,which exudes white light. As the film ends only one person escapes into the light and....freedom?
The films opening is disturbing but it quickly backs away and starts out slowly introducing each character and their idioms. However the claustrophobic fog permeates the entire film and it never dissipates at all,thus pulling you into their world with ease. It is a simple concept yet complicated at the same time,focusing hard on the complex beings that are humans.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include some deleted scenes,commentary and a short interview with Nicole De Boer.
All in all a wonderful film study of humans in a guinea pig environment,with no where to go and only their wits and each other to rely on to escape....but do they?The ending has a neat and bittersweet twist. Highly recommended. 4 1/2 stars.",1358121600,2,2998,4.846003898635478

996341,3,6305238065,"You wake up on the floor of a cell with five other people - none of whom can remember why they are there or how they got there. The cell is 14 foot on each side and there is a hatch one each of the four walls and on the floor and ceiling, each leading to another identical cell. You have to find your way out of the complex before you die of thirst, but your way is beset by lethal (and rather gruesome) boobytraps and the rising tensions and in-fighting between your companions.

Like other reviewers, I first caught this film several years ago on the sci-fi channel. At first glance, it doesn't have a lot going for it. There are no big name stars and the acting ranges from average to thickly-sliced ham, although Andrew Miller turns a fairly convincing Rain Man performance as a mentally challenged savant. The plot is linear in the extreme; the initial tension the viewer feels quickly evaporates as the prisoners discover that the traps can be avoided by reading clues in the rooms' serial numbers (which also provide a handy escape route clue) or by the simple expedient of chucking their boots into the next room before entering.

In its favour, the set is certainly striking despite (or because of?) the low budget and sparse SFX. I mean how much would you need to spend on a set that (probably) comprised of one or two identical prison cells? It was, however, the /concept/ that captivated me when I first saw the film. The idea of being trapped in an apparently endless series of cells, some benign, some designed to kill in the nastiest of ways, resonated with my worst nightmares. It's a concept that richly deserves further exploration (and it got that in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/two/dp/B00009PAJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">two</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/sequels/dp/B0006HIPSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">sequels</a>&nbsp;of mixed quality). Who built it? Why? What were the prisoners guilty of ? Why the booby traps and why the escape clues? Certainly the origin of the prison is a huge elephant in the room and the prisoners speculate about it (one is even revealed to have been a clueless sub-sub-sub-contractor in its design) but in the end the film never ventures outside the confines of this construct and the questions are left hanging. That ambiguity is probably the film's greatest strength.

Unfortunately, though, it's not quite enough to raise the film far above the parapet of ordinariness. Once you've experienced the environment and discovered that there are no answers, all you are left with is the group dynamic - the rising tensions, the allegiances, treachery and violence and, as I mentioned the ""could-do-better"" acting doesn't quite manage to set fire. Having seen the film once and been captivated, the second viewing came as a bit of a disappointment.

Nevertheless, this is a good film - well worth one or two viewings. The DVD is no longer in print and it seems that different sellers have different pressings. Mine came with dutch sub-titles (not deselectable) and no extras of any particular note.",1324339200,,3141,5.165029469548133

Since they're mostly unpleasant people, they quarrel and yell at each other. This goes on for an hour and a half. There's some violence and some gore.

996343,4,6305238065,"With a rather minimalist approach kind of reminiscent of 70's era science fiction, Cube (1997) is a fantasy adventure where a number of individuals are trapped in a very strange environment, and struggle to work together to find a way out.  How the people got there and why, are questions that are never addressed, as the film primarily focuses on survival in the present.

The construct consists of a series of interlocked cubed shaped `rooms' of different colors.  There is a hatch in the middle of each of the six sides in each room, with a short tunnel leading to a similar cube shaped room.  There are traps in some of the rooms, so determining which rooms are `safe', becomes a key for the survivors.  The group are strangers to each other, and not much is revealed about their backgrounds.  Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) claims to be cop, Leaven (Nicole de Boer) is a student adept in mathematics, Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor, Rennes (Wayne Robson) is a button sucking convict, and Worth (David Hewlett) is a man who knows more than he is telling.

Having no food or water, provides some motivation for escape, and when one of them is killed in a trap, safety becomes the primary concern.  The series of numbers engraved in each of the tunnels, becomes the key to their movements.  Her facility with numbers, makes Joan the one who determines which way they go.  Along the way, they find Kazan (Andrew Miller), an autistic man who proves to be something of an idiot savant when it comes to numbers.  Eventually, the group discovers that they are in a huge cubic construct made up of thousands of interconnected cube shaped rooms, that actually shift positions periodically.  Even when they succeed in reaching a room that is on the edge, they find that escape is still not possible.

According to Vincent Natali (Splice), who wrote the original story and also directs, the story having no context was a critical element.  As so little is known about the characters, you tend to float along with them, and take things as they come.  The film does a good job of putting you there in the cube with the survivors, as they struggle to come together and understand their situation.  After a long journey, things starts to deteriorate under stress, and the characters turn on each other.  The evolution of the various relationships is quite fascinating.  While not entirely credible, the violence adds some interest, and takes the story to its conclusion.

The acting is generally good, with Nicole de Boer, Nicky Guadagni, and Andrew Miller, perhaps doing the best jobs.  Cube has an interesting premise, with a solid and creative story built around it.  Shooting most of the scenes using the same room, the film was innovative at the time, and still holds up well today, although with a relatively low level of action, and the requirement that the audience use their brain some, Cube may not capture the fancy of those who are expecting slick special effects.  Thus far there have been two more Cube films, Cube 2: Hypercube (2003), and Cube Zero (2004), which is a prequel to the original film.",1310860800,,3105,4.753731343283582

You have been dressed in coveralls and combat boots. As you make your way from room to room, you discover some are trapped in ways that you will be killed (usually instantly and horribly). You find more people in the same mess. Can you find a way to work together and suspend paranoia/suspicion that not everyone is telling the truth?

The idea that the Cube was originally a mammoth public works project that got out of control was serviceable enough, and hey isn't that like life?  The problem with these metaphorical approaches is that certain events in the movie disallow them.  Then how do you explain how everybody got in the cube?  How do you explain how they don't remember?

A perfect review.  Completely accurate. But I still find it entertaining as anything.

It has truly cringe-worthy acting and writing and makes such a ham-handed attempt at a philosophical commentary that it is truly sometimes hard to watch. It is gloriously bad. It has worse acting than ""Twister"" if you can believe that.  The actors - especially the guys that play Quentin and Rennes (okay the doctor too)- really act like they are parodying bad acting. It is THAT bad.

Also, more disturbing than anything in the movie are the reviewers that really believe the movie makes some profound statement.  It does attempt to, but the execution is abysmal, and it just turns into a long cliche. It has the most stereotypical character types you can imagine - it's like a bad science fiction Breakfast Club, except in the Breakfast Club you ended up liking at least a few of the characters.

CUBE - People wake up in a labyrinthine cube with no idea of how they got there or why they've been kidnapped.  They must navigate through a series of deadly traps, without knowing just what it is they're headed for (or even where it is).  A doctor, a famous escapist, a cop, a mentally handicapped fella -- personalities clash, and what could've been a tight little parable of existentialism becomes a squabbling social commentary about the brutality of big, mean men.  It's tense, but not paced particularly well, although the ending has a thankful spot of hope.  Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Rubik-s-Cube/dp/B00081RYNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Rubik's Cube</a>, most people will find this cube compelling for a few twists and turns, but are unlikely to find the ending all that rewarding.  3 1/2 stars.

Dimensional that is.  Gone is the first cube's relentless dankness, replaced here by sterile, unapologetic white.  Although the new cube is also fraught with hidden perils, these are mostly of the multidimensional variety.  What this means for you, the viewer, is that the traps are now CGI contraptions that look not convincing in the least.  It also means that many rooms have their own gravity and ""variable time speeds.""  Oh, I almost forgot, the most awesome thing it means is that it exists in multiple dimensions at once, so there are apparently about fifteen different copies of each person wandering around at the same time.

Did I say ""awesome""?  I'm sorry.  I meant ""unfortunate.""  Because this cube has basically no rules, virtually anything can happen, making what DOES happen less important in the long run.  We've got some crazy characters -- a senile physicist, a blind girl, a private detective, a video game desinger and a lawyer -- and they all have connections with a scary-big corporation named Izon, but who cares?  The least plot driven of the three movies, this film is also the darkest (in spite of how well-lit each frame is).  And, of course, it succumbs to the same mistake as the first film.  Instead of being about the little people coming to terms with the bizarre futility of their circumstances, it devolves into a big man going crazy and chasing everyone around with a knife.  2 stars.

Maybe it's supposed to be a prequel, but I doubt it.  It's possible they just thought ""zero"" sounded better than ""three.""  Or maybe it's because, for the first time ever, the viewer is treated to life outside of the cube.

Don't worry.  The cube is still there, just as gloomy and lethal as ever (and in far more vividly gross ways), but the group of people inside the box are at least as important as the people watching them.  The watchers in this case are a couple of be-jumpsuited guys named Wynn and Dodd who sit around, play chess, and record people's dreams.  These guys give the series a chance to do some more overt navel-gazing, but the end effect isn't that bad, even if it mostly just feels like a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinter-play/dp/0802150969/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinter play</a>.

Still, no matter how full of dread and terror his plays were, Pinter always kept the terrible and dreaded things off-stage.

An effete and over-acted character named Jax pops in, followed closely by two well-groomed go-fers.  (Everytime Jax talked to them, I could swear he was calling them Thin and Quickly, but the credits list them as Finn and Quigley.)  They are heralded with whimsically creepy violin music, like an incidental theme song, and although they aren't fooling around, their presence makes the whole thing far less ominous than it normally would.

Still, the wackiness they provde is menacing and self-assured, and it disguises a story with far more heart and smarts than its predecessors.  Even if the story contains, yet again, a big, angry man chasing people around, that is a minor part of the much larger, much more hopeful picture.

I won't go in to plot points here, because other reviews have already done that.

What I will say is that this movie was expertly crafted. Watching it, you'd never guess that the entire set consisted of only one 'cube' room and one partial room - the crew built interchangeable color panels to give the illusion of different room.

Here's what 'cube' does well:
1) Amazing character arcs.
2) Killer acting chops.
3) Directing - tremendous .feeling of tight spaces and character intensity
4) Editing - great pacing.

996506,3,6305238065,"Seven strangers are trapped in a deadly maze and must work together to escape.  Each of the seven prisoners has a unique personality, background, and skill set; can they work together to solve the riddle of the cube and escape?  I thought this was a very interesting idea for a film and is largely driven by character development among and interaction between the prisoners.  In the end though, the characters are so unrealistic and uncompelling that there is little to hold your attention.  The maze, or Cube, consists of a series of interconnected rooms.  Each room contains six doors, one on each wall, one on the floor, and one on the ceiling.  Some of the rooms contain deadly traps that the group must figure out how to avoid.  They must also figure out how to exit the maze.  The six persons trapped in the maze include a college math student, an autistic man, a policeman, a doctor, a fugitive from prison, and an architect.  Initially the story is very compelling:  why are they in the maze?  who selected these individuals?  who built the maze?  how do they get out?  A tense, claustrophobic atmosphere is created as we learn some initial details about the maze and about the prisoners.  As the story develops though, the characters start arguing amongst themselves, ultimately fighting each other.  The nature of the arguments is silly, and in the end I couldn't wait for the film to be over.  Once they figure out how to escape, the film turns into more of an escape/evasion type of story as some try to leave the other(s) behind.  The writers and producer took this film into a pit from which it couldn't recover.  Some of the most enthusiastic reviews claim that this film is a microcosm of society or other such nonsense.

996507,5,6305238065,"This is one of the most intelligent films ever made. It is a metaphor for the prison that is the limitations of the human mind/western society.

The key to understanding the film is illustrated in the open scene when we see a lone guy get turned into dog food: they can't survive alone, they have to cooperate with others.

Unfortunately, the people in the Cube though are just like me and you, they are people who have individual skills but have individual flaws and this prevents them seeing the woods for the trees. They are prisoners of the individually and socially constructed limits of imagination, they are prisoners of society and the cube is just a microcosm of this.

I find it astonishing that so few people actually seem to understand this film.
The clues throughout the film are abundant. Each of the characters' names represents a prison:

Leaven + Worth = Fort Leavenworth Prison.
Holloway = Women's Prison.
Kazan = Prison for the mentally handicapped.
Rennes = Prison that innovated many prison norms and regulations used today (Hence Renne's creativity in dealing with traps).
Quentin = San Quentin, a prison known for it's brutality.
Alderson = A prison that focuses on isolation as a form of punishment.

Each of the characters has a skill that will help the group as a whole to escape but conversely each skill is tied to some character defect. Quentin is the leader (cop) who is also a bully when he doesn't get his way, Worth is, effectively, an insider who knows about the making of the Cube - he knows that there is no master plan or conspiracy but that the Cube is just a product of people like him who just do what they are told, accept a pay-cheque and don't want any trouble. Worth is not really that bothered about telling anyone else in the Cube because he is not really concerned as to whether he or anyone else escapes - he is indifferent, 'worthless'.
Holloway cares for the mentally ill but shows no care or tact towards her peers.
Wren is an escape artist but not interested in helping the others escape.
Leaven is a pretty, young and brilliant Maths student but tends towards apathy.
Kazan is a maths genius...perhaps...but has no ability to socialize (he is autistic).
Alderson is a loner whose faith above reason destroys him very early on.

The set of characters in the cube are bound by culturally constructed laws, rules and letters. There are 26(x26x26) rooms which may represent letters in the American-English alphabet. The rooms are all marked by 3-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates (representing the limits of human spatial imagination). Traps in the rooms conform to a rule with respect to the particular coordinates and the prime numbers applicable to the 3-digit number.
The Cube and the technological traps within thus represents western society as a product of technico-cultural evolution and the individuals inside are trapped by a) the limits of their imagination as represented by the Cube logic, as well as by b) their inability to cooperate.

These two facets are the simultaneous products of historico-cultural evolution of western thought. The Cartesian perspective of ""I think, therefore I am"" projects a dualist, separatist view of the world - i am different and separate from that around me. This philosophy is, in itself, a product of the legacy of orthodox Christian theology - Christianity is at heart a religion that preaches separation and ego-centrism, e.g. I am special, if I behave i go to heaven, I have an inner-self which is in some sense separate from the material world.
This perspective conflicts with Eastern philosophical doctrines such as Buddhism that emphasize instead the oneness of beings and the (physical and social) world around them. The inability of the individuals to apprehend the Cube's limitations (and thus be able to escape) is a manifestation of their own inability to throw off the shackles of their own personal and inherited socio-cultural history - they are born free but everywhere they are in chains. They are trapped by their own separatist identities, perceived failings, and ego-centrism.
Furthermore, they are victims of being part of a society that rewards such separation. They are stuck in the ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" (Axelrod, 1984) - the simple premise is that cooperation can provide greater benefit than self-interested behaviour but only if others are willing to cooperate. If other fail to cooperate, it is better to be self-interested rather than a sucker.
This is a frequency-dependent phenomenon meaning that if a majority decide to cooperate, then cooperation will pay and cheaters may even be punished so as to encourage cooperation - tight-knit Eastern societies such as those in Japan and China work along these principles.

So, ultimately the individuals' skills are tied to their failings as this is all part and parcel of the separatist identity they have developed - an aspect of human nature that necessarily develops from infancy to adulthood in conjunction with basic self-consciousness and identity formation but has been prolonged into adulthood by a socio-cultural western tradition routed in Christian and Cartesian separatism and egocentrism.
The prisoners' inability to recognize that they are just elements in a bigger dynamical system which doesn't render them worthless (a perceptual side-effect of egocentric excess) but rather necessary elements of the macro state, the group, accounts for their failure to escape - the irony being that the one escapee is the one that is indifferent to his fate and not bounded by the rules and regulations of the Cube so representative of the western socially constructed world.

Through the overcoming of egocentrism the individuals have the potential to escape their personal prisons that the Cube represents and that is a manifestation of a symbolic, rule-based world in which they have developed - again a Christian legacy that has affected philosophical and scientific perspectives (e.g. information theory, gene-centrism, cognitivism) and governs western thinking to this day.
From this escape they can unravel possibilities that may take them beyond the constraints of current western intellectual imagination and free them from the hell of a world that is bereft of executive instruction (whether from God, aliens, or human dictators) and is instead a socio-culturally evolved accident.

996593,5,6305238065,"I believe that CUBE has a deeper meaning than just inacting how humans react in extreme situations.

To state the conclusion first :
Cube is a film about language and structure that humans are forever bound to.

In CUBE, there are 26 x 26 x 26 cubes in the entire structure. This represents the 26 alphabet letters and their combinations. The characters wake up in the vast structure of CUBE, just as humans wake up to a world of language, symbols, and meanings attached to the symbols. When humans wake up to the reality (when you begin to have a sense of self and existence) this happens within the scope of language. When we are born we start our lives by recognizing the image of ""mother."" Then we recognize ""self.""

CUBE represents the dimension of language. French psycoanalyst Jacques Lacan suggested that the subject is permeated by language. In the movie, Decart's coordinates are mentioned as a key to figure out the position of the cubes. We all know Decart's famous saying: ""I think, therefore I exist."" The mentioning of Decart may suggest the message that our existance is defined by language by which we think. Conversely, Lacan suggested that thinking and existing are not compatible, because to think means to follow the structure of language into which we were born. Because our own identities are only definable when we are free of the identity of symbols that restrict us, we can never exist as a self with language.

This goes along with the meaning of CUBE. The struggles of the characters are struggles to find their way out of the claws of the world of symbols that define them. And because they cannot exist out of the structures of language, no one manages to exit CUBE through the 27 th room (the unexisting 27 th letter in the English alphabet) except Kazan, the only person free from language. (Perhaps because he does not have the ability to grasp language as the others do)

The first person to be killed (the person who never meets any others, wanders into another room and is meshed into cubes) possibly represents a priest. The absence of the representation of any spiritual leaders among the six people who manage to gather and the overall appearance of the meshed man suggests that he is a priest, possibly Christian or Catholic. The fact that he is the first to be killed suggests that he is the first victim of language and that he is forever bound by it, never doubting its existance or authenticity. This is only possible because Christianity is bound by language, depending on written and spoken sermons to convey important messages.

In CUBE, different cubes move about each other. This represents different symbols leading to other symbols and other meanings. Some people wander from one symbol to the next. Some are killed during their effort while some manage to return to their original position. From when we were born we had not needed to follow symbols and learn language because our existance lies eleswhere. In CUBE, when Leaven, Worth, and Kazan finally return to the cube they started on, Worth loses the will to escape. This symbolizes his fright of leaving the structure of language that defines his identity and existance. Or may be he just realized that the world out there is just as same, regulated by certain structures that he cannot escape from even at death.

The final scenes in which Quentin stakes Leaven and Worth symbolizes the symbol ""S"" perforated by a ""/"" which represents Lacan's theory that the subject is permeated by language. The 27 th room, like the 27 th letter in the alphabet that does not exist, is even harder to escape, save Kazan who I doubt knew how many letters the alphabet has.

I really like this movie and the deep meaning that lies behind it. I think that the meaning may differ from my guess, but still, this is the way I interpreted the film. This is only a subjective analysis, and I wanted to share this with other people. I haven't looked, so I don't know if other people think the same way or not.",1202256000,5,3994,4.687589158345221

A bunch of people find themselves imprisoned in a room. Only later they discover they are in a maze of umpteen such rooms. There is a devastating start to the movie with a booby trap which I won't give away. So the prisoners then try to understand why they are in these sets of rooms and who put them here. At first they believe that the rooms are rigged with booby traps at random which is later disproved and they find that there is a logic to the traps. The rooms that are booby trapped have the room numbers as prime numbers. There are a 2 significant people in the room who are important characters to be able to esacape the maze, A mental math gymnast girl and an autistic guy who is dumb is all other respects but can provide the factors for large numbers. There are suspicions within the group and a character changes from down right good guy to down right villain. The movie could have done with more gore. But after the first 2 traps and the gory outcomes for the victims, the movie goes into a sci-fi mode where it becomes more of a mystery-scifi-thriller where they are trying to guess the architecuture and the movement of these maze of cubes. The outside world is shown as bright light or darkness. It is upto us to assume where this cube might me. Also the creators of the cube is kept as a mystery. The natural assumption of the viewer would be that since this construct or maze of cubes is so huge it is either the work of a very powerful organisation such as the govermnment, possibly a clandestine government experiment or it could be that they are have been transported by ET's' into another world. Anyway that is upto out own imaginations. Not explaining everything gives it the movie this unexplained twilight zone touch. This movie is now a cult classic. THe movie was made on a low budget and the whole movie was shot with 2 sets. One set was one whole cube and the other was half a cube and there was only one moving door, the rest are static.

Some strangers, who don't know how they got there, wake up inside the cube and try to escape from it - essentially thats it. However each of the occupants has a particular skill that will assist the group as a whole from escaping. The Cube is in fact a series of interlocking cubes - sort of like a giant rubics cube. Some of the inner cubes are booby- trapped making life a little more difficult for the people stuck inside.

The movie was probably made on a pretty low budget, but the special effects are still pretty good. When you see the end of the film it doesn't feel like a Hollywood ending, so I wasn't that surprised to find that it is a Canadian film.

996598,4,6305238065,"The first and, by far, best of three (so far) Cube movies. The story is essentially a movie-length rendition of an episode of the original Twilight Zone series, ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit."" The acting and character arcs are effective and satisfying, as are the sets, score, and editing. The script is surprisingly literate, and well-developed in terms of both action and ideas--a perfect blend. The story is an existential nightmare: a number of people wake up in a cube-shaped room that they learn is one among thousands which in turn comprise one gigantic cube. Each room has a hatch on every side. Some lead to other ""safe"" cubes; some lead to death. The occupants have no recollection of where they are, how they got there, or why they are there. What characteristics does each of them possess that will help or hinder their attempt to escape? Who among them is a friend, and who can't be trusted? In what direction should they go, and which door leads to freedom? In this movie, the latter question is both practical and philosophical. Pure action fans, don't worry: This is a very fast-paced, exciting movie. At the same time, those interested in thought-provoking action/sci-fi will have much to ponder as well.

The script's key strength is that it provides no pat answers to the where / how / why of the characters' dilemma. But the script's ambiguity is artful; it is not the kind of cop-out ambiguity in which many lesser movies indulge when the production team either lacks skill, doesn't know how to effectively develop ideas, wants to tack on an ""artsy""  ending, or is making way for a sequel. By contrast, Cube's conclusion is striking, and not merely a gimmick.

The problems noted above indicate the many weaknesses of the other two Cube movies. The first Cube is a great stand-alone film. The sequels provide too many answers, too much unnecessary gore (especially Cube Zero). Thus, they retroactively ruin the first movie in the series. I don't inherently dislike sequels--only when they cast a shadow on their predecessors. I also don't inherently dislike gore; but, if one judges by the first movie in the series, gore really doesn't represent what Cube is about. Cube Zero (the third in the series) also has a silly self-parody component which conflicts with the tone of the series as a whole.

Bottom line: Watch the first Cube and avoid the rest.",1191369600,,2381,4.814180929095355

So by all rights this little Canadian indy should have been forgotten the minute I saw it, instead of being inducted into my very short list of favorites.

Of course it is rife with cringe-worthy moments like bad lines and broken logic (the math scenes are so hilariously trite that anyone with a kindergarten education will choke on their chips), but somehow this doesn't ruin the overall integrity of the film.  I think that all filmakers should watch this movie as an exercise in tight pacing and good suspense.  The latter is so well done that it carries the whole film and overshadows the shortcomings to a point where you almost don't care to let them bother you (note *almost*).

There, you have the entire movie, sadly. This is one of those films where all the interesting parts are right up-front, and the actual film is filled with stock characters, predictable plot points, cliched interactions and juvenile conspiracy theories. We're lead to believe that the people were chosen deliberately, yet some characters seem utterly useless, added only to create artificial drama. The interactions are not believable, the climax an insulting cop-out, and while the lack of explanation seems to work for awhile, soon it fails as suspense and you just stop caring.

It's not terrible, and you can admire how they were able to stretch out a minuscule budget. The acting is tolerable, though not good enough to transcend the shallow stereotypes they had to work with.

996686,4,6305238065,"One looks at a film like Cube and you kind of breath a sigh of relief. Since Hollywood is rightly accused of just churning out the same movies just with a different face, in comes films that you've probably never seen before and it becomes memorable simply because you can't think of another like it. So we have Cube, shot in Canada and it has a familiar plot but an innovative concept and is actually really intriguing despite the fact we never leave the same room.

A group of people: Quentin, Renne, Leaven, Kazan, Worth and Holloway find themselves trapped in an unusual place: a cube-shaped room with doors on either end. Not told why they're there or by whom and they notice something else: some of the rooms have traps and these are nasty lethal traps so the 6 have to figure out a way to get out, if there is a way out.

That's basically the story in a nutshell but you're surprised that it never seems to get old. The filmmakers used one room but with different color panels for red room, blue room and so on so we literally never leave the same room but there's enough in the story to keep you hooked. There's even a tense scene involving a sound-activated trap that's quite harrowing. If there's one thing I hate to mark a fault to is the reliance of math. When you have cartography points and factors, prime numbers and dimensions involving axis you feel like your head's going to spin. Luckily, they cast a sexy female to do the thinking so even if you have no clue what she's saying, she looks cute saying it. Then again, I was always a sucker for smart babes in glasses.

But the acting spot does take a hit. The characters are actually named after prisons and so we have basically one-dimensional characters. We have the psycho-in-training, the mentally challenged, the sexy nerd, the quiet hero, the nervous older woman and the ""I know best"" older man. But in the end we start to like certain characters because we gravitate towards that kind of person so me obviously I like the sexy chick while others might go for the quiet hero. It's strange that we almost never seem to leave the characters yet they ddon't develop all that much.

It may not win awards for acting and it probably won't be in your top ten films ever but it's kind of a film that's hard to forget too.",1172448000,,2288,4.427553444180522
996687,2,6305238065,"Saw Cube over the weekend, and Cube reminded me of the sub-par 2005 and 2006 Saw sequels. If we took the chicken/egg debate and applied it to the two Saw sequel movies versus Cube, obviously 1997's Cube comes out the winner in the which came first contest. So perhaps there was some Cube influence on the Saw sequel directors for turning James Wan's 4-star original Saw movie into what came out more closely to Cube sequels.

At least the Saw sequels made an attempt to explain why their characters were in the situations that they were thrust into and who was doing the thrusting. Cube presents no such explanations, which leaves the viewer unsatisfied when the credits roll. Cube has one of those endings where right before the credits roll you sense it's the end, but say out loud, ""Oh, this better not be the end.""

Cube has some good suspense as the captors move from room to room trying to escape booby-trapped rooms throughout the prison that they all woke up inside one day without knowing how they got there. And there is also good suspense as to the explanation of the what and where exactly the Cube is. I'm still waiting in suspense on the what and where as I write.

Perhaps the answers are in 2002's Cube II or 2004's Cube Zero prequel? I am not that inspired to find out, so don't look for my reviews of those.

Wrong. It's almost ten years old as of this writing, and I never heard of it, and it's really good. I mean, Really Good, in lots of ways. It's got characters I can really care about. There's Leaven, for one (Nicole de Boer, aka Dax of DS9). She starts out as the stereotypical wimpy, screamy girl. Then there's Quentin, who starts out the take-charge cop, the one you're sure will get our little band out of this lethal labyrinth. Just keep two things in mind. First, everyone changes over the course of the movie. Second, wanting to see some jerk get it is also a kind of caring, just not a nice one.

The way the characters change is another thing to like. This movie borders on the minimalist, and its fair to say they didn't spend a terrible lot on sets and props. The characters carry everything, and do it surprisingly well. This isn't a Great Movie in the sense of literary snobishness, but still a heck of a flick. The actors, plus the script they're given to work with, really make the movie. Another bit to like is that spending thing - they didn't do much. The actors are all good, but not in the gazillion-dollar class. Sets and props are well done, but there's not much to them. Costuming couldn't have cost more than $20 for each of seven actors. All this proves that money doesn't make a movie: artists and artistic vision do. Maybe money helps, but Cube shows that you can still get a big-budget feel on a very modest budget.

What's not to like? The ending. I'll let you get there on your own. Maybe that's why this movie didn't take off and make a boatload of money for everyone involved. But, they didn't spend a lot, so I hope they all went happily to the bank anyway. They deserve every nickel they made from it.

He invents a model of our psyche in which we are, everyone of us, locked up in a cube that is the universe of our consciousness. We are thus psychotic since the outside world does not exist. And yet the master of this world has set six windows, one on each side, all around us. We can open them, one at a time, and get out into another cube that has to be the psyche of someone else. But this trip is very dangerous. There might be a trap in that other cube, a trap set by the other or by the supermaster of the universe. We may be killed and die instantly. Hence we enjoy and find a sweet and soft refuge in our own psychosis. But sooner or later someone will come into our cube or we will get into another cube where we will find someone else. The drama of meeting with others will start as a competition to find a way out if there is one. But we will discover very fast that all the cubes of all the individuals of the world are all connected within an even bigger cube but that the various cubes are constantly moving. And yet there is a way out and we must find it. We are little by little becoming schizophrenic. And the elimination of the others becomes the objective that erases the possible escape from this world that we may have caressed for a while. Terminate the others, and fast please. To escape this world we need two qualities. First to be able to mentally and spiritually feel, sense and grasp the wider scope and scheme that is behind this cube, these cubes, and we then can see the red thread that is going to lead us to the exit. And we need to be attached to absolutely no one, or even to get rid of all those who could become attached to you or to whom you may get attached. These two qualities are autistic characteristics, but it is generally considered in our society as a disease if not some retardation. Thence we shrink in front of the others and we go back to our cocoonic psychosis that is more comfortable than this schizophrenia. Who controls this world ? Is it God ? But then what about divine love ? Is it the most pathetic human invention ever put forward, not to speak of a pure folly that we have spread among human animals like a retrovirus that turned these animals into self-declared human beings ?

I must confess that I am glad that I happened to stumble upon this movie on Amazon because it was everything that a horror movie should be. The Screenplay was very put together, the plot & setting were intriguing yet mysterious & the killings (Or cinematography if you want to make it sound all fancy) & visuals are quite impressive for it's 500,000$ dollar budget. Now, the only real complaint that I can say about the film is that the acting is horrid. Now don't get me wrong not ALL of the acting was that bad but I would be lying if I said that most of the actors were okay, the truth is that most of them had very little experience and THAT made the film look all-around quite a bit less professional and hard to look at as an ELITE horror film. I think that if the producers would have known when they made the film that it would do so well and have such great reveiws and number of veiwers than they would have been more than willing to dish out the few extra bucks in order to have some more experienced actors.

I thought that David Hewlett played David Worth (The Architect) acceptably and I also thought that Nicky Guadagni's performance as Helen Halloway (the Doctor) was pretty good. Other than those two I thought that the acting was very lightweight. The guy that played Quentin (the cop) was really bad which was quite a shame just because that characte had a big role in the film and was really important ... also I thought that they could have gotten a better and more experienced guy to play the role of the Autistic boy (or man it was some what hard to tell...).

I know that I keep going on and on about the acting but I cant wonder away from the truth to much. The concept and idea of the film was really quite brilliant, the screnplay was brilliantly written and the story line meshed with extrodinary ease. Despite the acting I was heavily impressed and the film was Overall very good.

996751,4,6305238065,"""Cube"" is a cult hit. That basically means that it's good or innovative, but not many people know about it.

Vincenzo Natali (also creator of ""Cypher"" and ""Nothing"") made his full-length directorial debut with this film -- a low-budet, innovative sci-thriller that feels like an episode of the ""Twilight Zone,"" as written by Mark Danielewski and Franz Kafka. Yes, it's that surreal -- and that intelligent and well-written.

Seven people have been placed in a cubical room, which is connected to a bizarre maze of thousands more. Among are a cop, a disabled man, an architect, a student, a doctor and a criminal, and all of them have wildly disparate personalities. But they soon learn that behind the countless doors, there are deadly booby-traps.

So of course, their chances of survival don't seem so good. But they soon learn that their placement in the Cube is no accident -- each one has skills that the group needs. To escape, they will have to band together and use their brains. But why are they in the Cube in the first place -- and is the maze even the same as when they started?

Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" is a perfect example of what Hollywood can't seem to grasp -- it doesn't matter how much money is poured into a movie, because it's the concept, brains and skill that make it good or bad. Not the special effects or the big names.

And Natali did a magnificent job with his first full-length movie, infusing what seems to be a straightforward thriller with a taut, claustrophobic atmosphere, and some ominous hints about morality (or the lack of it) and sociology. It also has an unusually intelligent script, with prime numbers and their powers playing a big part, right next to the gruesome deaths. And of course, the solid dialogue. (""You've got a gift."" ""It's not a gift. It's just a brain."")

At the heart of the creepiness: Natali only reveals the secrets of the Cube as they are revealed to the characters, which adds to the suspense. What is this thing? Why are they in it? We know as much as they do. And we're only going to find out more about it when they do.

 It's also a movie that bothers to have real characters. No screaming teens here -- the movie's plot depends on them being very different. Natali and Andr Bijelic reveal the characters through their action and dialogue -- some are whiny, some are cruel, and some are just annoying. Some of the acting is rather flat, and a few of the arguments ring hollow, but overall it's very like watching real people.

Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" gives a good name to shoestring budgets and eerie plots. Definitely deserving of its cult status -- bizarre, twisted and creepy.",1151107200,2,2648,4.653104925053533

What works well with Cube is that we go along the ride with the characters. They have no idea how they got there or what is going on, we learn everything with them. The acting was decent and the CGI effects were nothing special, but overall the creativity makes this more than your average horror movie. Anyway the more I watch the film the better it gets, and more ideas and meanings come to mind everytime. Its Good too see more people are viewing Cube, probably because the sequels are recently being shown on TV now.

Great concept. Director Vincenzo Natali is difinitely one of the most brilliant directors out there. The film is intelligent, allegorical, and boasts an unbelievable perfect ending (i.e. the final shot of the lone survivor departing the cube, aided by a beautiful piece of music). Incredibly atmospheric and intense, and unlike most movies these days, it leaves many questions unanswered. My knees felt like jelly when the film was over, and I was left staring at the screen long after the credits finished rolling. The film has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, from a composer I know nothing of (Mark Korven). There should be a CD soundtrack!

A brilliant, intense film. Certainly not for everybody, but one thing is certain: No matter your disposition on the film, there's no denying you will never forget it once you've seen it.

If you do an indepth look  you will realize  all the names of th epeople inside the cube are names of prisons in 4 different countries, and furthermore  their personalities decribe what the prison is like.

Kazan (autisic guy) come from  Kazan Prion in Russia  which is a psychiatric prison

Alderson  comes from  Alderson prison in West Virginia.  This prison commonly uses isolation as a punishment.  Alderson died alone having never ran into anyone.

Rennes  comes from Rennes Prison In France.  Rennes was kinda the groups mentor.  He showed them 2 tips on how to survive, the

 group took these as policy.  Rennes Prison is where most of modern prison policy originated.

Holloway comes from Holloway Prison in England.  Holloway is a prison for women

Leaven And Worth come from Leavenworth Prison in Kansas

Leavenworth has stict rules so does math wicj Leaven is a whiz at.

Leavenworth was bulit corportely by architects.  Worth was an architect.

Quentin comes from  San Quentin prison in California.  Both Quentin's are brutal.

The makes of this movie really did their home work to make those connections.

The plot was good also,  total strangers  with their memory of how they got there wiped out have to rely on each other to survive.",1147824000,4,1357,4.786026200873362
996755,4,6305238065,"I won't say too much cause there's really not much to say about the plot beyond the premise:  A pack of unrelated individuals find themselves inside a complex of interconnected cube-shaped rooms which seem to go on forever.  (And some of them contain traps...)  Needless to say, they must get out, though they have few clues.  If this premise sounds interesting to you, check it out, though you should note that this was made for only like $500,000 so the acting and production values aren't going to be up to major-release standards.  I say this partially because 'Cube' is unusually prominent for a film this cheap, so it draws the attention of the sort of viewer that wouldn't necessarily be used to watching something this low-budget, and thus is unable to make the leaps necessary to get into this.  It is abundantly obvious that many of the negative reviews here come from people in this position.  They certainly aren't required to like 'Cube', but their opinions really aren't of much use to  those who'd be part of the core audience of the film.

Suffice to say, if you've watched many low-budget genre films you'll have seen plenty of cheaper effects and worse acting, so these sort of complaints won't effect you much. (And frankly the acting just generally isn't bad for the most part.  The Quentin character tends to over do it a lot of the time, but everyone else is fine.  They ain't gonna win any Oscars, but they're serviceable.)  It does slow down perhaps a bit too much at times, but it's got enough clever, significant revelations at various points to maintain interest, and the dialogue and conflicts between the characters prove fairly entertaining during the downtime.  The film has got some rather nice gore, I might mention, not a whole lot of it, but they make it count.  Furthermore, it does seem to have some allegorical concerns relating to modern society and whatnot, and while it doesn't say anything terribly profound, I think it comes up with some reasonably salient and truthful comments on how the modern world works, and illustrates this stuff well through the actual plot of the film rather than just tacking it on.  More significant, it's got enough going for it from a purely dramatic standpoint that it can work even if you don't care about these thematic concerns.  And yeah, this movie is kinda like an overblown episode of 'The Twilight Zone', particularly reminding one of '5 Character in Search of an Exit' on a very basic level.  But hell, I like that show a lot, and we could use a few more things like it in modern film/television.

Yeah, a cool movie.  Check it out.

They soon discover that each possess skills that can enable them to negotiate themselves out of this trap composed of interconnected cubic rooms.  To make matters worse some of the rooms are booby trapped in a deadly fashion.

The group is led by Quentin, a crazed obsessed cop played by Maurice Dean Wint.  He is greatly aided by brilliant mathematician Leaven played by Nicole de Boer who discovers that the way out is based on complex mathematical permutations.  Quentin's whipping boy and voice of reason of the group is Worth played by David Hewlett who amazingly was part of the architectural group responsible for the construction of the cube.

In the absence of food and water a timely escape from the cube is of the essence.  As they begin meandering from room to room, fear and paranoia set in and the group begins to splinter into chaos.

For instance, one girl is a mathematical genius, and another is a doctor, and their qualities come into play during the movie.  The group eventually figures out that there is probably a way out of this thing, which only we as the audience know that it is a cube for sure from the beginning.  There's enough drama that happens throughout the movie that it is very interesting.  It's not just people simply going through different passageways.  But it's what they do in the cube and how they react, and all the discoveries they make about themselves and the cube that make this movie intriguing.  You being to wonder if everyone will make it out of the cube, if there is a way out of the cube, and what happens after the cube.  You have to watch to find out.  This is one of the most excellent movies done on a low budget that I have seen so far.

In these CUBE movies, people are caught in deadly traps, but some may actually think their way out, more or less facilitated by acts of heroism.  We're never really sure why they are placed in the traps, but it seems because of some crime they may or may not have committed, and waived immediate execution by participation in an experiment.  Hmmmmm?

Suppose that the evil government may not always fail, but does always suffer with inner struggle that thwarts its ultimate success in varying degrees.  An evil government's nature is that its members have blind faith in principles at odds with nature, which principles ultimately fail or become benign under the test of time (the universe is intrinsically good and balanced).

Systematic failure, such as in Cube Zero,  is predicated upon moral conscience in humans-a quality that cannot be manufactured or controlled.  (Numbed . . . maybe . . . but not controlled)  Cube Zero is about such men: Both Brainman and Chessman come to realize their dilemma by way of conscience; then they act upon it.  It costs their lives, but all this is what constitutes heroes.

All the Cubes are for gory fun and entertainment.  To try to find answers in fiction to cosmic mysteries is ridiculous.  Nevertheless, to have your imagination and sense of self expanded is brilliant.

The acting this guy does in this movie is so awful it's just about beyond human comprehension. Accurately expressing how bad he is is out of the question, he's surpassed that very last category of badness reserved for describing only the most atrocious things, and has passed into a realm that is as of now undefined.

With all that said, this is still a very fun movie to watch, and I still recommend it. The acting may not be great, but it's not annoyingly bad like in some other movies, it's kind of humorous here. It's still fun watching these people go from room to room, trying to beat the next trap that the room can throw at them.

It's not that often when we get a chance to come across such a talented independent film that shakes our imagination and makes to look at the genre with a fresh eye. I think if we start recalling such titles, we won't recall many. But for some reason, you know, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is still remembered by many and some other pretty decent flicks are not. I guess ""Cube"" will be remembered.
It unfolds as a group of people, total strangers, find themselves in some odd place - it's a room which has four doors in the walls, one in a ceiling and one in the floor. Every door leads to another room which is identical to the previous one - other 6 doors. More to it - some rooms contain deadly traps... And what just that might mean?!
Although the story-line itself is very intriguing and intense that makes this film a perfect suspence thriller, the creators managed not to spoil everything in the end like it usually happens. They offered us a finale which was mellow, which suited the whole movie and didn't even try to ruin the picture.
From this point of view I was extremely disappointed in the second and third parts of ""Cube"" which were limp and impotent. If you haven't watched them, don't even bother - I'm sure your life as a cinema-fan will be much better without them. And regarding the first and only ""Cube"" - it's a must I'd say.

As I went to the registration, the guy said 'it's an awesome movie'. So as I popped open the DVD player, I watched the trailer before seeing the movie. 4 nights later, I decided to watch this on the PC with head-phones. I was glad I watchd this. Cube is one of the best movies ever made with a great story, awesome suspence, nice acting, good characters and some great gory scenes. But mostly, this is more story and suspence than gore. Now a lot of movies ripped off the begining scene and the sets, including the story. We have The Cell, Resident Evil, AVP and House of 9.
The start of Saw referenced the scene where the characters woke up in the Cube, with no idea how the hell they got there.
Now a lot of people say the acting was above average. I though the acting was ok. Andrew Miller (Kazan) did a great job, David Hewllit (Worth) was awesome and the others were fine too.
The suspence was great. It was so dark and freaky. You hear the other rooms going to the other side when you're all alone and thats what makes it scary.
The story has this 'scratch your head' moments and you want to know whats going on. The building of the Cube is the real mystery; who's using it and why use it.
Vincenzo Natali did a fantastic job here. I love his sets and atmosphere for this movie because it keeps you guessing, it keeps you on the edge of you seat and most of all, it proves that he is a very good filmmaker. I also think he made a great choice of hiring composer Mark Korven. He is an excellent composer. He's soundtrack of the movie makes me wanna get the soundtrack myself. So did I have a good time watching this? YES, because it was different from the other 1997 movies.
Overall, this movie is awesome. If you haven't seen this movie, nows your chance. Get to your nearest video store and grab this off the shelf.

Acting: 8/10
David Hewllit (Worth) had an awesome character here. He shows us how good and proving he really is. Nicole de Boer (Leaven) did have some good parts. She does this teenage thing really well. Andrew Miller (Kazan) made me love his character. It feels so real.

Gore: 9/10
The start scene was one of the most original thing I've seen in the 90's. A guy gets cut into cubes, acid burns some guy's face off, an impalment, some blood and a severed leg (if you have wide-screen, you know what I'm talking about)

T&A: 0/10
None, but who needs it anyway?

Directing: 10/10
Vincenzo Natali has created one of the most atospheric moods of the 90's. Another winner.

Bottom Line: Sci Fi and Horror fans should check out this excellent and awesome film. It is so good I kept watching it a dozen times. If only it was aviallable to buy in stores.

Why? Because it takes your brain to have an on switch to comprehend what's going on. The ending at first hade me thinking: what the heck? Until I thought about it, and it made sense. This seemingly weird ending ended out being one of the most original and smart endings that I've ever seen.

The acting for the movie is fair with 1 or 2 good performances and the rest pretty average.

The movie has strangers waking up in a mysterious location..a cube. They learn to know each other and try to find out why they are there. There are doors everywhere and as they travel it, they decide that they all have an important function to escaping. Standing in their path are booby traps that are all activated by different senses. Some of the deaths are incredibly gruesome (check out the opening scene) but pretty fascinating.

The movie's weird, I'll tell you that, and might be a puzzle for some people. Some might be dissapointed by the ending that doesn't really solve some mind blocks. But, that didn't matter to me anymore..on the other hand, what mattered was human nature and showing all of these strangers' nature. The movie is like a study..throw some strangers in a mysterious location and see what they'll do. The result isn't pretty. It shows how desperate humans are and how far some will go to achieve what they want. And that's really what made me enjoy this movie..this study.

In the end, I was trully fascinated as the real human nature, the most unlikely person comes out. This shows a fascinating idea that made me in awe. It's not about what people are on the outside but what they are on the inside. And these ""heroes"" turn out to be cowards...awful cowards.

Cube can't be classed in a specific section because it incorporates science fiction and a study of human nature. It definitely isn't action and calling it horror or action is plain stupid.

996896,4,6305238065,"Cube was a very satisfying sci-fi/suspense flick. It is quite an experience just to watch the story unfold -- the viewer experiences everything just as the characters do. But once it's over, there's not much left you'd want to see again. And in my opinion, because of it's ending, it is a little disappointing.

Without giving away the ending or any surprises, here's the basic plot: A divided group of unknown (and as far as they know, unconnected) individuals wake up in ""The Cube"" without any knowledge of how they arrived there. The Cube is a gigantic box, more or less. It has many, many revolting rooms that connect to each other through square doors on the walls, ceilings, and floors. The strangers don't know why they are there, or what they should do. They just figure they better stick together and try to make it out of there. But the confusing task of finding their way out of the gigantic maze is made much more difficult (and dangerous) because some rooms are fatal traps if you enter them, rigged with deadly sensor-sensitive devices. They must find out how to differentiate these rooms from the others before more people die (indeed, we get to see a few deaths before anyone begins to decipher the pattern). Before long, the small group is navigating their way through The Cube somewhat successfully (considering how spontaneous of a terrifying occassion this is). The ""connection"" between them is starting to make a little sense, as they all have certain jobs or talents that allow them to help out and do their part in trying to escape the massive maze. Yet surely enough, the paranoia starts to swell up in all of them and they begin suspecting one another of being a part of the horrible game. Without any food or water or outside communication, it seems that even if they're not mechanically slaughtered trying to find their way through the deadly Cube, then they might die within it.

Cube is indeed an edge-of-your-seat mind-game of a film. The same questions that the characters have are the same ones you have. The isolated world of The Cube is all you know -- and it's all they have. Throughout, it's a continuous roller-coaster ride of fear, death (or at least near-death), and confusion. So why is this not a top-pick in my opinion? The ending. Don't worry, the writers knew that with such a great story and script they couldn't throw any old ending in there. It had to live up to the rest of the movie. So, instead of taking the risk of choosing an ending ""twisty""  or ""explosive"" enough (or hell, even a REVEALING ending) the writers decided to leave the audience with something peculiar: the same feeling they had at the beginning of the film. The ending is quite unexpected and equally baffling, but you can be assured that Cube is an odd way to spend your time considering how the one thing keeping you interested from beginning to end is never truly resolved. This, although, could be considered a good thing. It does leave the viewer to come up with his own theory and dabble in his own imagination. So Cube is certainly interesting. Just be sure to realize that you'll have to play along at home in order to enjoy the ending.

By all means, rent it and don't buy it at first. It is a great scifi film. Yet it fails to give the audience any reason why they should watch it twice.",1122163200,4,3315,4.594594594594595

In that respect, as a character study, I found ""Cube"" immensely interesting and even surprising.  The character arcs are believable and well thought-out, and the dialogue supports them.  I thought the casting was excellent as well -- clearly, that's a ""love it or hate it"" aspect of this movie, as the other reviews indicate.
The film's weakness, however, is the setup itself -- it's a great idea, but unlike the characters, it's never developed.  (Skip to the next paragraph if you don't want to see potential spoilers.)  Who ""runs"" the cube?  Why were these people put in it?  Where does escaping take them?  These are all questions that the characters themselves ask, but they're never answered.  We don't even know the time period (for that matter, we don't know if it's even Earth...).  It makes it difficult to know how to feel when the closing credits roll.
It's not uncommon to leave questions unanswered to allow the audience to bring their own interpretation to a story, but it's a fine line between doing that and leaving questions unanswered because the filmmakers don't know the answers either (I get the impression that's the case here).  Tough call on the rating...but I'm giving ""Cube"" 4 stars because by virtue of the characters and what we do know of the setting itself, there are a lot of genuinely suspenseful moments and unexpected twists, and I just plain enjoyed the movie.  If you're willing to overlook the undeveloped setup, ""Cube"" is worth your time.",1117584000,2,1940,4.857142857142857

996900,5,6305238065,"A seemingly random selection of an undetermined number of people awaken in a massive cubical death machine consisting of thousands of cube-shaped rooms that are constantly shifting positions - kind of like a giant rubix cube.  Some of these rooms have deadly booby traps.  This is the premise of Cube, one of the most original and exciting science fiction movies of recent years.

The film succeeds on many levels.  The premise is intriguing and facilitates an absolutely brilliant, and cheap, set deisign.  All the rooms are the same except for color.  This creates a stagnation that is generally avoided, but works beautifully here to reenforce the intended feeling of frantic claustrophobia.

Despite its harsh and inhuman setting, or perhaps because of it, Cube exudes a vital humanism that is, at times, even a little overbearing.  The small sample of people become a microcosm of society.  Because their interactions are so immediate and their circumststance so dire, the characters are allowed to explore practically every aspect of social interaction in society.  There's the white liberal doctor, the young college student, the invalid, the criminal, the cynical worker bee, and the male authority figure - a cop with serious insecurities and tendencies towards violence.  Ultimately, the film makes an argument for cooperation and understanding - We're all in the same boat, let's help each other - that kind of thing.  Call it Christianity or Communism, I like it either way.

This hopefulness for humanity is contrasted with the complete pointlessness of the situation.  The question ""why"" is asked constantly, and it is never answered, giving Cube an existential bent.  More particularly, Cube is the epitome of kafkaesque.  It makes an obvious statement about the banality of endless beaurocracy that can often support Fascism.  However blatantly, Cube makes a powerful statement about blind acceptance of illogical constructs.

There are a couple of flaws worth pointing out.  There are times that the dialogue gets clumsy and some of the performances are distracting.  But overall, Cube is well-written, thoughtful and technically astounding (set, light, photography, editing, direction, etc..)",1113436800,,2210,5.387755102040816

Although ive lost some already in this review for those of you who have continued to read on to this point let us begin with the review: If any have ever read works by Camus or Sarte you have a pretty good idea about the utter desolation and pointless isolation found in the philosophical framework of existentialism. However if you've read Sarte's play called No EXIST (a great piece of work by the way) You will find three people trapped in HELL looking for an exist only to find that in the end there is no escaping oneself and that hell in fact is other people and the torture we inflict on each other. In the CUBE you will find a highly advanced visual concept of this wonderful masterpiece. I won't go into much detail so as not to ruin it for those of you who haven't seen it. But I will give you a taste in one simple question. What would you do if you were trapped in a cube with five other people all confused and scared knowing that should you leave this cube there is a very good likelihood you will be killed (same is true if you don't leave the cube), oh and by the way one of the guys in the room with you is slowly turning into a paranoid schizophrenic with homicidal tendencies? Another point I should make is that if you go into this movie with pre judgments regarding the movie and how it should run you will likely be disappointed. This movie is very unique in its own right, Most movies have outside sub stories and subplots, however as any student of Existentialism knows there is no outside, no heaven, no hell, only the here and now, there is no god (if there were one why would he let you be put into such a terrible predicament?), there is no one outside the cube, and no one cares about those inside it, the only thing that might hold some meaning is, the actions we make in this life and the consequences that come as a result. All the effort we make in life for the most part is pointless and has little if any real meaning. You will see this in true form when they meet the REN for the second time in this movie (im sorry that was a little bit of a spoiler) The only reason I won't give the movie five stars was due to the fact that the ending was pretty predictable, and I think anyone will see it coming early on. However, if you are the type that enjoys a good thinking movie that makes you ask the age old question of WHAT WOULD I DO IN THAT SITUATION? or are just a major philosophy buff check this movie out, I think you'll be glad you did.",1111795200,3,2810,4.313799621928166

996985,4,6305238065,"At its best I think ""Cube"" is an example of post-modern existentialism, although I am certainly loath to explain that particular combination of 20th century reactions to modernism. At its worst it seems like a pointless variation on an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" which may or may not be ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"" (but if you watched Rod Serling's series I am sure that at least one episode will spring to mind as you watch ""Cube""). However, just because I think that Vincenzo Natali's film is trying to be provocative does not mean that I think it is necessarily being profound.

""Cube"" begins with our first look at the cube set that will be creatively redressed throughout the film. A man (Julian Richings) enters the cube and we discover that these can be places of great danger. We do not know what is going on, but whatever game is being played it is decidedly deadly. We then meet the players and the game begins in earnest. Eventually we find there are six people still alive in this system of interlocking cubes. Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) is a cop, Rennes (Wayne Robson) a prison escape artist, David (David Hewlett) is an architect, Helen (Nicky Guadagni) a doctor, Leaven (Nicole de Boer) a math student, and Kazan (Andrew Miller) is autistic. None of them know how they got there, why they are there dressed in uniforms, or what they are supposed to do next. All they know is that in every cube there are six hatches leading to the next cube, one on each side. What they learn is what we already know. Some cubes are not safe.

The six assume they are in a maze. Since there was a way in there must be a way out, and one of them figures out that there are actually clues as to which hatches it is safe to go through and which are not. That becomes our biggest clue as to what we are supposed to be doing as viewers, because it is clear in this 1997 film that putting ourselves in the position of the characters is problematic. For me watching ""Cube"" was similar to watching ""Survivor"": the main thought going through my mind is that I would be dead because I would not be physically up to the challenge. So I did not get into the ""what would I do in that situation"" frame of mind.

Instead my focus became on the group of six people. When we learn that one of them has a reputation for breaking out of prisons we discover that these people are not only the only resources the group has but also the only ones they need. The point is that the lesson is lost on the group, and the question is whether they will figure it out in time. Of course, the larger question is ""what is going on?"" However, at this point in the saga (""Cube 2: Hypercube"" came out in 2002 and ""Cube Zero"" just come out on DVD), that would be telling. More importantly, the fact that they do not tell is key to appreciating what is going on. It is not yet time for the big picture, but for the intimate horror story being laid out for us.

Even if you are not interested in why this is happening, the ""what"" of ""Cube"" is compelling enough. The deadly cubes are always dangerous in different ways, and you are always wondering what is going to happen next. Especially since the ""deeper"" the group goes into the ""maze,"" the more they get into their own paranoia, which is decidedly not good for the developing group dynamic. In the end, ""Cube"" can be dismissed as a shaggy dog story, but it is a much more engrossing one than the story about the pink and purple polka dotted ping pong ball.",1109203200,3,3487,4.36
996986,3,6305238065,"This movie starts off on a good foot.  The fact that the viewer is kept in the dark about why these people are being subjected to the tortures of the maze-like cube is tolerable...at first.  The writers go to all the trouble of suggesting that the characters did not randomly end up in the cube, but were selected because each of them possessed a certain talent, but gives no explanation beyond that.  Yes, the math student and idiot savant are able to decipher the riddle of the cube, but what are the others there for?  And you never find out who put them there and why, and that just doesn't sit well with me.  It's as if the writers had a really good idea for the BEGINNING and the MIDDLE of the movie, but couldn't think of a good ENDING for it, so they just left it as is.  They never even hinted at who and/or what may have been responsible for constructing the cube and placing these people in it or even why it was built (ok, so they VAGUELY suggested that it could be the government/military or aliens, but VAGULEY).  It's not as if I want the writer to tell me ""this is what happened and why,"" but they could have done a MUCH better job of at least offering SOME explanation(s).  Leaving the ending open for interpretation doesn't make the movie more interesting, just more lame.

996987,3,6305238065,"""Cube"" is constructed in the style of the so-called ""New Wave"" of science fiction, which has actually existed for more than 20 years and is no longer so ""new.""  The characteristics of New Wave are that the endings are often more ambiguous, and the science part of science fiction is often significantly less well explained or perhaps even understood, causing some New Wave science fiction to border on fantasy.  In the case of this movie, a group of people are spirited away from various places with no memory of being moved, only to wake up in a room in the shape of a cube.

At first it appears that the people were randomly chosen.  However, as the movie progresses there appeared to have been logic as to why this particular group of people was chosen, though the specifics of the logic are never explained.  We find out later that the group of people chosen has the capability of escaping from what turns out to be a gigantic maze of cubes.

If the only task of this group of people was to escape from the cube maze this movie would have been very boring.  When one of the characters is killed in a most gruesome fashion near the beginning of the movie we learn that some of the cubes are booby-trapped.  We also learn that there are cubes that are not booby-trapped and by a mathematical calculation you may determine whether the next room is safe or contains death in the form of acids, various cutting instruments, flame, etc.  The movie slowly moves the characters from one cube to the next, fighting the cubes as well as themselves, and losing characters along the way.  I will not reveal the end of the movie for those who plan to watch it.

The one thing this movie has going for it is the novelty of the cube maze.  Adding the booby traps changes this movie from a pure mystery to a cerebral exercise.  Why was the maze created?  Why were these particular people chosen?  Why booby-trap the rooms?  Are these people just human guinea pigs?  Is there a safe way out of the cubes?  Given that the majority of this action in this movie is arguing and moving from cube to cube, the speculations provided are the core of the movie.

I was intrigued by ""Cube"" and have seen it twice.  However, after having seen it twice I am no longer amused and do not plan to watch it again.  While the concept of the cube maze is interesting, there is a certain measure of futility that discourages multiple viewings.  The futility of being in the maze adds to the generally poor acting and occasional over-acting.  The only actor I recognized was Nicole de Boer, who played a math student, from her role on the television series ""The Dead Zone.""  Definitely rent this one before you buy it.",1108080000,6,2685,4.488659793814433
996988,4,6305238065,"Imagine this: you went to sleep, soundly, in your own bed. Hard day, harder night: drinking, carousing, maybe; maybe you curled up after a stressful day and an even more stressful commute with a good book, and sleep came crashing down. Whatever; past is prologue, and prologue here doesn't mean much.

You wake up in a cubic room. It's about 20 feet by 20 feet. In the center of each cubic face---even on the ceiling---is a hatch. You're clad in a prison-style grey smock, with your name stenciled gulag-style above the right nipple, and when you have slightly recovered from the initial shock (where am I? Is this a dream? What do I have to do to get back to the real world? Where do I poop?), you amble dazedly over to the hatch on the left and give the submarine-style airlock door a turn. It comes open, and gazing through the aperture, you spy---another Cubic room, that looks just like yours.

That's ""Cube"", a vicious little puzzlebox of horror and delight from Vincenzo Natali. It's brilliantly simple, conceptually engaging, brutally compelling.

The opening sequence, for instance: a man opening up a hatch, shinnying through it, setting foot in the new Cube Room---and then a noise that sounds like a butterfly farting, and the man---Alderson---goes rigid, his body frozen in place in a living rictus, eyes wide, a true Kodak moment for just a split second. And then, an instant later---

Nah, I won't ruin it for you. Suffice it to say that the Cubes contain death traps---well, some of them. We meet the heroes, chiefly, as they meet each other: somebody opens up a hatch and peers through, only to find one, or two other prisoners, clad in grey smocks, equally bewildered by their twisted predicament: Math student Leaven (Nicole de Boer), architect David Worth (David Hewlett), rugged cop Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), Dr. Helen Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), Autistic Kazan (Andrew Miller),escape-artist Rennes (Wayne Robson). In whole or part, the names of our players are prisons: Leaven and Worth, Kazan (a notorious Russian labor camp), Holloway, even (San) Quentin. None of them have anything obvious in common, apart from their mysterious confinement.  Oh yeah, and those prison names.

Spooky.

Frankly, when I first saw Cube I hadn't heard anything about it; I knew what the idea was, roughly, and I had seen the first five minutes on HBO.  That five minutes alone sold me.  But aside from techno-bloodletting, I wasn't expecting much from Cube.

As a result, Cube snuck up behind me, banged me in the skull with a blackjack, locked me in a cube full of cubes, and made off with my socks (leaving me my shoes so I could check the rooms for traps).  Director Vincenzo Natali (who did not direct the second installment---and it shows) keeps the storyline a taut tripwire of paranoia, makes the most of his spare set, pumps up the tension with solid acting all around, and ices the cake with some deranged little engines of destruction (all fitted nattily into those deceptively harmless looking little cubes) that would make a Hellraiser Cenobite giggle with delight.

Natali dumps his ingredients into this deadly steel cauldron, stirs the brew up, and brings it to a boil by milking the tension between the characters as they struggle to understand their plight and---more importantly---to get out of the Cube.  Best of all, he punctuates the internal struggle between a group of people who don't know and don't trust each other, but need to work together nonetheless, with shrieks of wanton, and totally unpredictable, carnage.

I'm a pretty adventurous guy, and I've never been one to put my horror movie cannon fodder through something I wouldn't do myself---that's no way to treat the Troops!  But this time, watching these frail, highly perishable, lightly clad, completely defenseless men and women carefully testing out an unknown cube, checking with shoes for hidden pressure plates, ever alert for shifts in the atmosphere---perhaps an acid spray, perhaps a serrated spinning whirly-blade of death, maybe a floor to ceiling Mach-8 speed cheese grater---you truly appreciate how puny human flesh really is, how easily it can be mangled.  You get tense yourself just watching; too many times I thought ""better them than me"". Brrr.

Natali succeeds by keeping Cube simple: without much exposition and with absolutely no clue as to what lies outside the interlocking cubes---if anything---we have to know the characters from what they tell each other, and the environment from what the characters see.  Getting out is not only vital, but seemingly impossible: the gang can't simply cross horizontally from Cube to Cube until they reach the ""outer Cube Wall"", because death trap rooms bar their way---as a number of hapless---and unwitting---human mine detectors prove. Who would do something as vile as this?, they wonder.  Why us?  And to what purpose?  And do the series of numbers---what appear to be serial numbers, actually---hold any clue to working out how to get out of here?  As it turns out, the Cube isn't the only thing in this flick with secrets.

In the end, Cube provides a little something for the whole family: the bloodthirsty gorehound will spend a giddy 90 minutes punctuated by constant bursts of ""Oh Hell yes!"", while those more intrigued by the colossal mystery of the fiendish cubic puzzlebox will walk away sated.  And for those who dread more than anything else having to wake up Monday morning hung over, alarm clock blaring, a tedious commute yielding up only another agonizing week of work---rejoice!  Cube proves it could always be much worse.

CUBE is the story of a small group of people trapped in a giant cube, and certain rooms are trapped. The cube looks like a Rubick's cube, with different colored rooms. The main characters (Leaven, Worth, Holloway, Quentin, Kazan, and the Wren) all have a certain ""quality"" that will help them find the way out of the cube, but they just have to figure out what that quality is.

I wouldn't say that CUBE is a very scary movie, but it's definately creepy. CUBE is a good movie to watch with a group of friends or late at night (both make the movie more interesting - with a group, you can try to figure out what everyone's special quality is before the movie tells you; and late at night, the movie is a lot scarier).

996991,4,6305238065,"If you woke to find yourself in a strange room -- a perfect cube, with six hatches leading to more of the same -- what would you do? How would you find your way out, and would you work with or against the others stuck in the puzzle with you? CUBE raises these questions, and many others, but don't expect too many answers; the cube itself is a mystery wrapped in an enigma that sort of walks in a circle around a puzzle, but the film isn't about what the cube is or where it came from. It's an examination of human nature. Locked away from society, in a moment-to-moment struggle for survival, can we retain our humanity?

Unfortunately, the mystery of the cube is both the film's strength and its weakness; though the cube's existence is examined mid-way through the movie, with a somewhat shaky explanation of where it came from, we're not given all the answers. Keeping it a mystery keeps it interesting, but at the same time, doesn't really allow you to believe in the situation as much as you might need to to get really involved with what's happening on the screen.

Also hampering your connection to the characters is their sheer abrasiveness; though their situation is likely to bring out the worst in anyone, it's not so much the characters as the way a few of the actors portrayed them. Maurice Dean Wint overplays pretty much every scene and Nicky Guadagni reaches whole new levels of hysteria. Nicole deBoer pulls off her role pretty cleanly, and Andrew Miller does surprisingly well as Kazan, the autistic man. The only truly standout performance is delivered David Hewlett as Worth. His portrayal is nuanced and captivating, and his character shows some great development throughout.

Still, despite the movie's flaws it turns out to be fairly engaging viewing, and by the end you'll find yourself rooting for certain characters, wishing others would just die already, and probably shouting advice at your TV. After all, you'd have no trouble surviving the Cube with your humanity intact... right?",1102809600,,2011,4.789625360230548
996992,4,6305238065,"I like cubes...ice cubes, sugar cubes, beef bouillabaisse cubes, Rubik's Cubes (am I sound a bit like Forrest Gump?).  So here we have a movie called Cube (1997).  Actually, I purchased this a while ago, and since watched it a few times, but never got around to writing a review on it...until today.  Directed and co-written by Vincenzo Natali (his first film), Cube has a relatively small cast featuring Nicole de Boer (Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil), Nicky Guadagni (Storm of the Century-the TV mini-series, not the film), David Hewlett (Chasing Cain), Maurice Dean Wint (TekWar), Andrew Miller (Last of the Dogmen), and Wayne Robson (Cold Creek Manor).  What that's?  You've never heard of any of these actors?  Well, neither did I, but then given the relatively low budget (well under $500,000) of this Canadian feature, I wasn't expecting Brad Pitt (or even his lesser known brother Stu Pitt...geddit?  Stu Pitt?  Ah well...)

As the story begins (the first scene is a hoot!), we witness a small group of rather disorientated people, dressed in prison-like garb, coming together within small, square room.  They have no idea how they got there, or why, and have never met each other before now.  We learn the intricately designed room is a cube, one of many, and each cube has six doors (one on each wall, along with the ceiling and the floor), each door leading to another cube.  Also, some of the cubes contain lethal traps (acid, razor wire, flamethrowers, etc.) activated by a variety of different types of sensors.  This just keeps getting better and better...as we meet the various members of this small group, we find out that each person seems to have a particular talent, and what first appeared to be just a random grouping of people throw into a wacky death maze, now seems to be something more...like each was picked for his or her specific talents.  Well, that's seems like good news to the group, but the bad news is the pressures and the stress (along with a pinch of paranoia) threaten to tear the band of unfortunates apart, just as surely as the traps within the cube.  As this plucky assemblage moves from room to room, they do find a pattern for orientation of the cubes, but is it one that will lead them to an exit?  Or will it lead them to an acid soaked, sliced and diced, charbroiled demise?  You'll just have to watch and see...

Alright, I will say this...the acting isn't that great, and the script and delivery of the dialog feels extremely clunky at times, but I was impressed and entertained with the originality of the story.  As far as the story goes, we know as much about the situation the characters are in as they do, and learn things as they learn them, essentially putting the viewer in the cube, but without the possibly nastiness of suffering one of those ouchy traps.  This will upset, frustrate, and even anger some viewers as people generally like to be in the know, like to have things explained, and need a reason for why things are...but I feel everything doesn't have to have a reason, and I don't need everything presented to me in easily digestible chunks.  The film offers little to nothing in the way of what the cube is, its' purpose, or why these individuals were chosen to be placed inside.  Also, the ending is purposely vague, as to coincide with the rest of the story.  This sort of reminds me of Patrick McGoohan's popular Prisoner TV series...when it ended, some people were outraged at the ambiguousness of the ending, as they were looking for answers and yet few were forthcoming.  I thought the direction was tight as Natali manages to keep things moving along.  The set's pretty minimal, as they used the same cubed room over and over, but did give it the appearance of a different room by changing the colors.  Nearly the entire film takes place in this cube, except for some scenes featuring some low budget, but decent CGI work.

One should be aware, as another reviewer pointed out, that there are (at this time) two different releases of this film on DVD.  The one being sold here now is the new Signature Edition (the director's siggy is on the front), and released by Lions Gate Entertainment.  The original DVD was released by Trimark, and has a slightly different cover.  The newer release features a new anamorphic transfer with a new Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mix (Amazon has yet to update the DVD features on this product page).  The Trimark release special features include Dolby Digital 2.0 audio, deleted scenes, comparative and alternate storyboards, production designs, set designs, special effects artwork, and a commentary featuring the director, actor Hewlett, and co-writer Andre Bijelic.  The Lions Gate version has many same features (except the set design material and the voice over commentary on the deleted scenes), along with an interview with actress Nicole de Boer, and cleaned up menus.  Also, they replaced the original commentary track with one featuring only the director.  I mention this as if you are going to buy this used, make sure you get the version you want, either the original Trimark release or this new Lions Gate Signature release as there are differences, although the film is essentially the same.  After reading many of the reviews, I see there are basically two opinions, those who really like the film, and those who hate it, suckered into watching it due to the good reviews.  Well, I enjoyed the film, despite its' obvious flaws, but to those of you who have yet to see it, rent it first.  For those interested, due to the popularity of this film in the realm of home video, a sequel called Cube 2:Hypercube (2002) was released.  It's slicker than the original, not quite as good, but maybe worth a look if you liked this one.

The first dude who gets sliced with the wire fence was a great scene. There was not enough of that. There should have been like 20 people in the 'Cube' for some really grousome scenes. Remember the one that the cop almost fell into and escaped with only a leg wound? I'd love to see what a body would look like after being caught in that.

The brainy little girl with the glasses was ultra hot. She made nerds everywhere stand up and take notice. I'll never think of prime numbers the same way again.

The cop was a real ass. He starts off like he's going to be the hero and the leader, but ends up being feared and ultimatly killed. He deserves it for dropping the doctor and beating a man with his boot. It's too bad Rennes didn't hang around longer. I think the escaped convict and the cop working together would have provided some great character development.

I don't think I'd watch this movie again, because now I know all the secrets. But anyone watching this the first time will definatly be entertained.",1099180800,,1168,4.373271889400922

For people who like to use their imaginations this is a good movie because it doesnt explain everything. It makes you think instead of just sitting there watching a movie. As for the bad acting I've read about, it is true. However, it's not like this is a huge movie with really big named actors. I mean they did pretty good for a movie that I'm sure didn't cost a whole lot of money. I have no idea if it really did or not. Actually I don't know that much about sci-fi movies. That alone should speak for this movie in that I actually liked it, as well as it's sequel, and I'm not really a ""sci-fi chick"". Plus it's not like the movie is expensive!

The only problem I have was that the acting in a couple scenes wasn't so great. In my opinion, I believe they are actually in something along the lines of purgatory. They don't remember how they got there. I think they are dead. The only reason the retard was the only one to survive is because he was the only ""pure"" one. He did no wrong in the movie, whereas the others did and were ""punished"" for it. At the end, the retard steps into the bright light, or heaven.

It is about 6 people from different backgrounds who wake up one day to find themselves locked in a room (Cube) with six doors leading to other rooms. Each room has some sort of hidden mechanical torture device. The movie is about why what and how. The Cube.. who built it? Why were they thrown there? How to escape? Etc...

If you are a mathematician -or understand math for that matter- you'll appreciate the accuracy of the puzzle aspect of the movie.. Truly well done. It's a rarity among movies and very refreshing to see a movie where the movie maker actually done some research. The plot in my opinion is solid and if you think there are holes in the plot then look again and watch it again. It's worth it. Some people describe the movie as ""too mechanical"" but I think that was the point of the movie. Not to ruin it for anyone who didn't watch but after seeing it you'll get what the movie maker is trying to say.

As for the DVD version, not much additions. Just some deleted scenes.

997049,4,6305238065,"What a great concept. A handful of people awaken to find themselves trapped inside a bunch of cubical rooms, connected by doors in each of the six faces. They have no idea where they are or how to get out, but since they have no food or water, they need to find out fairly quickly. But some of the rooms contain deadly booby-traps, and nobody knows how to tell which ones they are. Turns out all the rooms form one giant cube; nobody knows exactly why anyone wanted to construct such a complicated, useless, and potentially deadly piece of machinery -- let alone why anybody would deliberately put _people_ in it . . .
This premise would have been at home on the old 'Twilight Zone' series (or even on the original 'Star Trek', with the trapped parties being Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, and 'Crewman Green'). And ya don't gotta be Kafka to smell the allegory; at any rate, if _your_ life has never felt like this, you probably won't like the movie.
The execution is very good too. Obviously a film like this requires a small ensemble cast and a script that manages to keep things interesting for an hour and a half even though all the 'action' takes place inside a series of practically identical cubical rooms. It has both. I won't spoil anything here, but there are some genuinely suspenseful moments and there's a lot of excruciating _psychological_ tension. (And not just from claustrophobia.)
I'm knocking off a star just because I just don't think the characters quite gel. They're interesting enough, but they're neither sufficiently complex to keep me fully engaged with them nor sufficiently 'archetypal' to support the allegory. In some respects their characterization occasionally seems inconsistent.
Very cool movie, though, and the slightly weak characterization isn't much of a drawback. It's not at all a 'hopeful' film and the ending won't make you gasp with moral relief; nor will all that many of your questions get answered.

This being the first Cube movie, had more of a rustic, organic feel to it, the rooms were either red, blue,green or yellowish, with etched walls. The few people stuck in them had a hard time not fighting with hech other in order not to go mad and get out alive. It seems that it's usually human nature to start fighting and getting psycho with others, when trapped in a situation, rather than calmly trying to think their way out of the situation.
This is a far out there survival story, they aren't lost in the woods, but in some colossal game/trap. Great movie to keep you glued to your couch for an afternoon.",1084665600,4,855,4.251533742331288

All the while the characters interactions grow more paranoid and distrusting of each other until they conflict breaks out. The dialogue ranges from the outlandish to the sublimely bitting, in particular Worth's commentary on the possible reason for Cube. The ending is a downbeat but suits the tone of the movie.  The acting is good and whilst the characters are to some extent ciphers the situation that they find themselves in doesn't really need more then the archetypical characters that we get. Of the cast Nicole De Boer and David Hawlett are the standouts and get the best lines and growth. What does it all mean? Part of the appeal of the movie is that it doesn't give you any easy answers; instead it functions as sociological Rorschach test, is it a critique of the mechanistic nature of society today? An allegorical, cautionary tale on the need for humanity to come together to progress? A tale of moving from purgatory to heaven? In the end the movie allows all these interpretations and more. Ultimately this is a not a movie that is easy to watch or like but if you do stick with it then it can reward you with a film that is a brutal commentary on society.",1080000000,,1548,4.608695652173913

I found the film to be gripping. disturbing and somewhat unsatisfying.
But the most unusual, and shocking, aspect of the movie isn't mentioned in any of the reviews I've seen.
'Cube' can best be viewed as an allegorical thriller, with the nature of the huge cube in which the protagonists are trapped left open to interpretation.
But if the character's final idea of what the cube is and why they are inside it is to be taken seriously, then 'Cube' is one of the most nihilistic movies ever made for a popular audience.  Whether you want to look at the story as symbolic of the individual's struggle in society, or if you just want to accept it at face value as an gory horror yarn, 'Cube's view of the human condition is so bleak as to be positively subversive.

997113,5,6305238065,"Ah, but the above question has no correct answer as most good questions in this life don't. The Cube offers the situation with all its detail and intrigue, it offers the questions, the dillemas, the pondering and the eerie suspicions.
  But its real thrill is that it offers no answers. The answers are all up to you to come with (if you wish), but even if you do you'll never be confirmed plus you'll find that mostly everyone else might disagree with you.
  The five humans that (basically) wake up to find out they've been transported unknowingly to a strange and evil-feeling mechanic environment (the ""cube"") do what anyone would try to do:
  they try to come out. To escape.

  But as they realise that the cube is not only a massively compartmentalised prison but also one laced with lethal traps mostly everywhere they decide to put their brains a little bit more to use. But this doesnt seem to help much either. Because figuring out how to come out of the cube while simoultaneously not dying in the process is difficult and offsetting enough.
  But the real torturing part for the protagonists is not all that. It's the questions themselves. If you know why you're in a prison, what the purpose of that prison is, who's set it up and what the overall scheme is, you might go about your efforts with a more collected mind.
  Yes, but you see, the prisoners of the cube know nothing. Not only the know zilch about the cube but also nothing about each other, and, as they eventually are forced to admit, not much about themselves either.
  The Cube is undoubtedly one of the best sci-fi films of all time. Some have criticized the acting level in it but in my opinion it is the acting that actually makes it all the more convincing. The fact that none of these actors is a ""name"" is an added plus. It emphasizes that this could be you, or, that indeed this might you at this very moment. The fact that you feel sure you ""know"" where you are and what you're doing there is the same thing these people thought too. Usually all it takes is a more careful look and the Cube starts appearing in all types of shapes and forms all around you. Spooky? Nah, reality isn't spooky, it's what's beyond it that is.
  Filmed on a somewhat low budget but with brilliantly fitting and believable settings as well as pretty good effects for the money available this movie has ""classic"" written all over it.
  Besides, even if the technical part wasn't (or isn't) totally up to par this would hardly take anything away from this masterpiece. It's not about how flashy the cube is or how ""cool"" the victims inside it are, is it? Nobody with enough suspicion in him cares about that. It's, as i said, the questions that matter.

  Go on and discover those questions too if you've somehow managed not to ask yourself about them till now. And good luck coming up with anything close to an answer...",1075075200,,2884,4.505769230769231

 The idea is certainly compelling, and the director manages to pull it off well. The camerawork is intriguing, never distracting, yet varied enough to sustain interest during dialogue scenes.

In many ways I found it more compelling and thought provoking than The Matrix, and I was particularly impressed with the stark set design. It even prompted me to attempt Kafka's The Trial. It also reminded me of movies like 12 Angry Men or Lifeboat with its claustrophobia and psychological archetypes.
I discussed this film many times with friends and I repeatedly made points about the machine being a symbol of our consumption driven post-industrial society. (I have also just finished reading ""The Subliminal Man"" by J.G. Ballard which deals with some of the same themes.)
I feel that it is important that one view the movie this way and based on the ending I feel like I ""got"" the message of the film.
 ...
The characters inside the cube have been called cliches, but that is because they represent types, not individuals. Cube is a study of how human types respond to their world, a world that is unfair, chaotic, dangerous, and ultimately without meaning.
This is definitely a thinking person's movie, it is more about ideas and metaphors.  The production values are low and the acting is kind of stilted.  Although it sort of reminds me of Survivor, the TV show.  That being said, CUBE 2, Hypercube, was IMHO a much Inferior movie, even tho the special effects were much better.

Another twist is that the rooms also move on a regular basis. I am not sure if the movie concept is original to this film or has been taken from somewhere else but it was enough to make me want to see it without any reviews from elsewhere. Where the movie fails terribly is in the story. Instead on being able to follow this group as they heroically try to escape this fiendish trap the film shows the characters fighting and killing each other. I understand that being trapped in this situation would be stressful for anybody but I think that most people would want to escape rather than assaulting and murdering their fellow prisoners. The movie focuses on this conflict rather than their environment or the attempt to escape. One of the character essentially goes ""postal""; this almost makes the movie just another typical violent gorefest. The brilliant premise of the movie and the environment are not exploited to anywhere near their potential.

""Cube"" is one of those films that you assume will be horrible because of the unknown actors and the fact that it came straight to video. However, do not let that keep you from watching this film. It is by far one of the most suspenseful and scary films that I have ever seen before. You never get bored or frustrated, despite the fact that all of the characters are put in a frustrating situaion. I was on the edge of my seat! All of the actors are quite good considering that they are all unknown. The emotion that all of them portray is extremely realistic. Also, all of the characters each have different personalities as well that you will find entertaining. Watching them slowly lose their minds is great. Perhaps the best feature of the film, is the cube itself. It is one of the best set designs I have ever seen. Every booby trap is set off differently, and all are extremely lethal. Not only is each booby trap different, but the color, size, and shape of the rooms are as well.
""Cube"" is one of the most suspenseful films you ever see. The acting, story, and cube itself are all done to perfection. The DVD extras are actually decent.

One of the reasons the film seems so fresh and original is the setting.  CUBE takes place inside of a giant metal cubic structure, which is itself composed of thousands of smaller cube-like rooms.  It is possible for occupants to navigate the structure by passing from one room into adjacent cubes through portals on each a cubic room's six sides, but such travel is not without its dangers. Some of the rooms are booby-trapped with deadly devices.  And from time to time, the myriad of cubic rooms shift their positions within the larger structure.
The actual story centers on a group of seven people--each with a different lifestyle and background and each therefore a stranger to the others--who awaken to find themselves together in one of the many cubic rooms, but with no recollection of how they arrived there.  They soon learn that they must reach the outside of the cube-shaped prison if they want to survive--most importantly, they have no access to food or water--and as their journey through the structure progresses, they realize that each of them has some unique talent that contributes to their ability to map a safe route through the overall structure.  However, as one might expect, they do not trust each other, and the resulting paranoia eventually leads to....
Sci-Fi and STAR TREK fans will be interested in watching the excellent performance of the cute and sexy Nicole de Boer, who would later go on to recurring roles on TV's STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE and THE DEAD ZONE.  Here she portrays a gifted mathematician whose talent is central to solving the riddle of escape from the cube.  Genre fans, especially those who watch lots of TV, may also recognize Maurice Dean Wint, who plays the primary antagonist in CUBE.  He has had guest roles in numerous Sci-Fi and Horror television series, including FOREVER KNIGHT, THE OUTER LIMITS, ROBOCOP, and FRIDAY THE 13th, just to name a few.
Few low-budget films are as literate or as engaging as CUBE.  What's even more impressive is that the filmmakers have created such a high-quality and entertaining Sci-Fi flick without relying on the usual inordinate amount of special FX.

I couldn't get a damn about who lived and who died,I liked only one thing about the movie and that's the first death in the film. I know alot of people love this film and some people (like me) didn't. But,to each his/her own right?",1064016000,4,375,4.1506849315068495
997178,5,6305238065,"On the surface, Cube is a most simple and elegant story. Six people trapped in a gigantic cube composed of rooms, some innocious, some others rigged with silent and deadly traps. Why have they been put here ? What is the Cube for ? What must they do to escape ? They don't know. But what they do believe is that by cooperating, armed with only their boots and their wits, they can get out. Little do they know...
I am a science-fiction fan, and this may cloud my judgment. Cube has been criticized for its average acting and a clich script. I don't know : I don't ask too much from actors, and I didn't find the acting to be noticeably negative. I didn't dislike the script either, although there is one character that should have come out far more likeable than he/she does in the movie. Let's just say the death in the middle of the movie really cheered me up. Those who saw the movie will know what I mean. Also, warning for the faint-hearted, Cube is also somewhat of a horror movie. If seeing a head eaten thru by acid is likely to give you nightmares, steer clear of Cube. Although I hate gore, there was not enough of it here to put me off the movie.
Discussing the nature of Cube would give away too much spoilers, so I can't really get into the philosophical substance. Suffice it to say that it is brillant (it is a wonderful indictment of statism and bureaucracy in general), although it doesn't really relate to much else in the movie. But the rest of the movie is very interesting too.
It is interesting to note that, for such an intelligent movie, the director and actors are totally clueless chaps, especially if you watch the little interview in the DVD with Nicole DeBoer, who incidentally was Ezri Dax in Deep Space Nine (I also thought that the policeman sounded like Sisko, but it's probably just my imagination). Perhaps this is a case where luck contributed to art. The director does acknowledge that he likes Tarkovsky (and gives away the plot of Stalker during the commentary, the blithering idiot), and it will be interesting to watch out for the future works of this fellow - Vincenzo Natali.",1057363200,3,2118,4.489637305699482

The set design was truly inspired, and no doubt cost efficient, and the initial character development was delightful. Now the bad news... The paper thin and ultimately unresolved plot. I enjoyed the set, effects and characters for the first 45-50 minutes but then something goes terribly wrong. What began as an alluring sci-fi/thriller degrades into a hack drama-fest that crumbles straight onto what has to be the worst ending to a film since Highlander 2.

997220,5,6305238065,"Just to get it out of the way, I'd like to say I was expecting much from this movie but was worried it would end up falling short of its concept.  I was not disappointed:  it was executed incredibly well, and remained captivating and unpredictable throughout.

What I really want to get into here is an analysis of what the movie meant.  Many have speculated, and I'd like to add my ideas.  First, it is important to note that, aside from the guy that gets offed in the opening scene, there are six characters in this movie, just as there are six sides to a cube.

All of the characters are vastly different, and can be said to represent the human race.  The cube is a microcosm that represents the world.  Almost all of the characters have glaring fatal flaws:  the cop that's concerned with self-preservation and dominion over others, the amoral engineer, the paranoid doctor, and of course, a criminal.

In addition, it helps to examine their names.  Characters like ""Leaven"" and ""Worth"" (""Leavenworth"") are suggestive of prisons, as is ""Quentin.""  But there is also the doctor, ""Holloway"" (Hollow).

Interestingly, despite the cube's many dangers, most of the deaths that occur are murders:  people killing people rather than the cube killing people.  In other words, despite this world's many natural dangers, mankind is its own worst enemy.  ""We are the cube,"" indeed.  The only character that is innocent and avoids all of the fighting done among the other characters is Kazan, who literally sees things differently from everyone else because of his autism.  He is the only one that escapes the cube, just as the only hope we have of avoiding destruction is to adapt a new worldview.

A great film, entertaining, original, and thought-provoking, with a theme that is carried throughout without being weighed down by the narrative.",1054598400,5,1837,4.867741935483871
997221,4,6305238065,"This movie has been described as a Twilight Zone episode written by Clive Barker, and that's as close a description as any.  The whole set-up of the film is rather imaginative, and one of the joys of the film is watching the characters figure out how to navigate this shifting maze without getting killed in gruesome fashion.  One of the other pleasures of the film is the visuals and special effects-- for a low-budget film, the sets look damn good (especially considering the difficulties they had making this-- the commentary on the making of it is almost as interesting as the film itself).
On the negative side, the script succumbs to the cliche of having the characters fight amonst themselves for no other reason than to generate conflict.  Others have faulted the acting and dialogue, but I don't think those aspects were that detrimental.  More importantly, however, the film lacks the existential weight that would have given a real Kafkaesque tone to the situation, so that the ending-- evocative though it is-- leaves one feeling slightly cheated.  Still, this is a lot more intelligent than what passes for fantasy/SF/horror these days.",1054339200,,1149,4.994764397905759

997224,5,6305238065,"IMPORTANT NOTICE to those buying the Cube DVD: there are two editions out there, the first was Trimark's edition, and now there's Lion's Gate's ""signature series"" edition (Lion's Gate now owns Trimark).  Apparently the original Trimark edition is being phased out.

This new LG edition is still excellent, but collectors will definitely want both editions as the commentary on Trimark's is much better since it includes cast member David Hewlett (they go more in-depth to some of the aspects of the film).  Why LG decided to replace that commentary with a new one with only director Vincenzo Natali is a mystery.  The only other difference is the new LG edition has a brief interview with Nicole deBoer, and a more interactive menu.

Now, on to the film itself:  Cube is one of the most original sci-fi films of the last decade.  If you were to think about what situation would terrify you the most, Cube would be the ultimate challenge.  In a way, it is a predecessor to TV's ""Survivor"" in which the people each have a skill that can help them survive and possibly get them out...here, being that seven people wake up and find themselves in an endless maze of cubed rooms, some of which are booby trapped.

It all comes down to human emotions and confrontations that get in the way of the characters' progress and survival.  It's a talky film, but that's the point -- figuring situations and dealing with different personalities is inevitable to any group.  The solving of problems becomes very complex, but the viewer doesn't have to worry...let the characters figure it out as we go along for the ride!

While so many sci-fi films want to wow you with effects, Cube does something more daring -- it makes you think!  With its limited budget working FOR its advantage and some digital effects that preceded even the film Titanic, Cube still proves itself as one of the most original and intelligent thrillers of the last decade.  It is truly a nail-biter.

Those who need more visual thrills and less ""thinking"" should just then stick with Cube 2: Hypercube.  However, this first and superior Cube is a masterpiece!  Gumdrops, anyone?",1051401600,2,2136,4.7923497267759565

I know they had a low budget, but come on.  Throw in a side story where people on the outside are trying to figure out the cube.  At least then we could have seen them sitting at a picnic bench or something.

Vincenzo Natali gives us a great view of what can be done with only a handful of unknown actors, a low budget, and one cubic room.
Here's how it starts: all the characters wake up in different cubed rooms, which we assume are all part of one giant cube (which is later confirmed). They come together and must figure out how to survive long enough to get out of a seemingly endless maze of room, all colored differently. Did I mention that some rooms are boobytrapped?
Now they have to navigate the rooms, figuring out along the way where they should go and how to avoid the traps. Right when they think they've got it figured out, something pops up that proves them wrong. The group starts to get desperate after a while with no food or water.
The movie plays out like a huge psychological experiment. When the characters are in cool colored rooms such as blue or green, they are calm and don't mind working together. But, when they are in warm colored rooms like red or orange (which seems to happen more often near the end of the movie), they become aggitated and easily annoyed.
Thankfully, the only information the writers give away about the Cube is what we need to know to survive, and all the rest is left for us to ponder. Who made it? How did they make it? Why did they make it? All of these questions are left unanswered.
While the ending angered many people, I thought it was just right. The acting went over well, although Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin) may have been a bit overbearing, and the character, I thought, was a little too quick to anger.
All in all, an excellent movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, as well as have you asking questions when it is done. It is definitely in my top 10. If you like your movies logical and totally wrapped up at the end, however, this won't be for you.",1047254400,3,1969,4.324324324324325

There is also the one character we never learn about, the man who gets killed early in the film.  We can't read much into him; he is either ignorant or indefatigably unlucky.  I really like how Levin is right.  They never should have left the initial room.  Had they just waited there for a little bit, all the rooms would have rotated.  The Cube would be ""unlocked"" and the bridge room was directly adjacent to the initial room.  This suggests happiness for the human condition.  We feel compelled to drudge ourselves through often meaningless activity, yet if we follow the advice of Levin, we should merely be content with where we are.  This is ultimately the most helpful and pragmatic (at least insofar as the film is concerned).  I am also looking forward to Hypercube, though I'm sure it won't be as good.  It doesn't even have the same director, for God's sake!  The film runs like a play with character development being the main function and a carrier of the plot.

An independent film shot on what I would imagine was a smallish budget, the special effects and acting is all top notch.  There aren't any real names in this film, though you may recognize a few of the faces.
The premise is not unlike an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Outer Limits,"" but its full length provides for some in depth looks at the people involved.  A group of people, with no relation to each other, are whisked away in the middle of the night and left in a largish bizarre looking room - a cube.  They don't know why they are there or how they got there.  They just know they want out.  They soon discover that there is no simple way out.  They are in a single cube that is one of many other cubes all part of a single large cube.  In order to escape they must move from cube to cube.  The only problem is that some of the cubes are boobytrapped - in a deadly way.  They must work together as a team and trust each other in order to escape.
Personal stregnths and problems become helps and hinderances as they proceed with their mission.  The nature of life and living becomes an issue.

997286,4,6305238065,"This is one of those movies which does make you think, and I'm not sure if most people really understand why.  Perhaps it has a different meaning to a lot of people.
Many reviewers of this film...describd this film as a ""existentialist breakfast club"".  It definately is in one sense one of those genre films where different archetypes are put together to interract in an artificial environment.  But in this case, what kind of environment and why?
Why would someone build this sinister cube? Is it just a plot device as many reviewers seem to assume?  The dialogue in the movie gives a clue.  The characters debate the purpose and origin of the cube.  The ""liberal nurse"" speculates it is some kind of military or military-corporate weapon.  The ""aggro cop"" assumes it's the plaything of a wealthy villian out of some James Bond movie.  But it's the ""cynical guy"" who seems to have the answers, and in my opinion really the most interesting thing to say in the movie.
He angrily confronts the arguing cop and nurse, and bitterly contends, that while yes, there is a conspiracy of sorts, a conspiracy which all present participate in by playing their social roles with tunnel vision and not caring about ""the big picture""... but it's not a conspiracy that any one person or group is in charge of.  ""Big brother is NOT watching you"" he yells.
It is, he seems to be saying, rather a conspiracy where the system itself has gained total control, and none of the people who have surrendered thier individuality and personal responsibility to this system, including the designers, are safe from it.  This echoes sentiments some very perspecacious social critics have voiced about the US and it's ""military-industrial complex"" including Gore Vidal and William S. Burroughs.
I believe the cube is an allegory to modern life in a world  increasingly controlled by large institutions, and increasingly dangerous and predatory toward individual humans.  Many people increasingly view the large institutions which we serve or obey in one manner or many, are up to dangerous, unethical, irresponsible activities, but we depend on them nevertheless as our shelter, our source of income, to provide our safety.  The cube - maze the characters are trapped in is a kind of allegory for this system, mindless, mechanical, intermittently lethal.
Even more creepy, the architect, the cynic, goes on to describe the cube specifically as being a project which took on a life of it's own, he completes the image described by the nurse, of atomized workers, firms, bureaus, working on something ... with the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing... and with no brain guiding either of them.  Something just building itself.  THis is reminiscent of the subtly creepy Stanislaw Lem book ""Eden"".
I'm not certain what the ultimate conclusion is meant to be, especially the significance of the ending, but I believe the movie was made to examine these ideas.  As a Canadian film it's especially relevant.  Canadians often feel themselves to be living in the shadow of a not always so benign United States.
Of course I could be wrong.  One reviewer described the nurse as a paranoid who 'brought everyone down' and felt that the cop...provided leadership and encouragement.  Perhaps this film is a Rosarch test of sorts, and you can derive many meanings from it.  I'm sticking with mine.",1035763200,7,3370,4.930973451327434

First - the movie ""Cube"":
Somewhat disappointing to me, it started out great though.  The special effects were excellent, and the traps were extremely scary.  But the problem is that it only showed a few traps being set off, and all those were in the first half of the movie.  The rest of the movie focused more on the paranoia, fear, and desperation of the remaining characters.  And shows what each character has to offer to help the others escape.
Not a bad movie at all, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars.  The reason I gave this DVD 5 stars?  That's the pleasant surprise.
On the second side of this DVD it had ANOTHER movie - ""Love and a .45""
I would have bought it separately if I had seen it earlier.  But as luck would have it I got it for free.  Look it up here or at imdb.com for more info on that movie, I'm not going to do a review for it here, sorry.

997309,4,6305238065,"Cube was a good film. I thought the premise was very creative, and interesting. The cinematography was well done, and the writing was mostly good, but some of the acting was weak. I found Nicky Guadagni's (Holloway) acting to be pretty heavy handed, and unnatural. And Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin) delivered a few labored lines. But the rest of the cast was good.
The film makes use of only one set, an empty cubical room. The actors are inexplicably trapped in an enormous, and complex series of these cube rooms. Some rooms are booby trapped, while others are safe. The only variables are the numerical codes placed at the entrances to each cube. The characters use these to navigate through the maze, and hopefully to find the way out.
Cube has suspense, originality, modest action, and emotion. So for that I give it four out of five stars. If you like offbeat, creative films that have a dark edge, you should check out Cube.",1033344000,3,929,4.670731707317073

It isn't pleasant to be human steaks, I believe. And that's what this movie is [on the surface] about. It's about a human rat maze. But this is a crazy Canadian film, and it's not just about the suspense, which is why it's a good scary, psychological flick. It's about a handful of people who need each other to survive but are victims of their own weaknesses, greed, selfishness, and compulsive need to be the survivor, at any cost. When the dark side of human nature begins to crack each one under the pressure, it becomes clear that the cube [while pretty ... scary] isn't the only thing they need to fear. In the grand tradition of Hitchcock and Twilight and Hitchhiker, this is a creepy thinker. Don't expect grand scale Hollywood hoopla, this is just simple, ..., original screenplay working well on a normal budget. This is a trippy movie worth renting......

997311,3,6305238065,"This movie drips of big aspirations.  People trapped in a bizarre maze of rooms.  The rooms, it turns out, are navigable, provided you're bright enough figure out their sophisticated, Rubik's Cube design.  And, it turns out, the only person who might have enough brain power to ultimately get the right answer is a Rain Man-style savant who appears to be able to figure out mathematical problems that are best left to computers.
That's the window-dressing.  The characters are archetypes.  Rather crudely drawn archetypes, but serviceable nonetheless.  Among them: the alpha male, whose penchant for control is equalled by capacity for brutality; the nurturing, but sterile woman who ultimately finds her humanity; the cynical, bright man who, at least temporarily, becomes a champion; the idiot savant, all innocence and brilliance, albeit annoying.
They recall, vaguely, a life before the cube.  But what, exactly, is the cube?  Is it a metaphor for modern life?  Is it the afterlife?  Is it a nightmare?  Is it, like the oddly well-done Twilight Zone episode, a trashcan filled with discarded dolls.  Well, the movie doesn't really answer that question.  In its effort to be profound, it answers nothing.  Sure, it provides some junior-psychologist insights into personality; it also toys with alienation and nihilism.  But it lacks a satisfactory and satisfying ending.  Movies don't need to be tied up in to neat little bows to be great.  Often, the contrary is true.  But the ending needs to be revelatory in some sense--to open vistas to which the story was leading, even if those vistas are mysterious, strange, unsettling, or vague.  This is where Cube falls, no pun intended, flat.  It is a minor melodrama, hinting of much, nicely stylized, a bit unexpectedly grisly, but ultimately unsatisfying.
Now, maybe that was the film makers' vision of the world.  Odd, throwaway characters (nothing deep about any of them or there capacity for communication and interrelationships), jaundiced ideals, and a meaningless existence as to which the ""outside"" represents something unknown and simply ""brighter"" than the darkness of our own existence.  Maybe.  But even if that is the truth, it is a story not all that well told.
Why three stars?  Because Cube, for all its faults, still makes you think a little, which is more than you can say for many, many movies.  There are many ""why's"" about the ending that are worth ruminating as a jumping off point for some interesting questions--why that specific survivor, the purpose and origin of the ""cube,"" and the significance of the final confrontation between the characters.

997315,3,6305238065,"...I am surprised not one mentioned the Twilight Zone episode ""Five Characters In Search of an Exit"". Maybe this is obvious, and maybe some other reviewers mentioned it, but it should be noted that this film is a long version of that episode.
The difference is essentially the object in which they try to escape, a cube that these characters found themselves in. Five characters who don't know each other, don't know why they are there, and have no reasonable exit for the place they find themselves stuck in. Yes, ""Cube"" is as existential as that. The cube as the metaphor for existence, while the characters ponder in various states of disarray why they were chosen to be there. This would be a highly egocentric point of view to think they were ""chosen"", would it not? It would appear from their lifes work that they chose, and even designed their lives to be there. Isn't that the metaphor? To be in a cubed room with 6 doors, all of which lead to another room of the same type? When life is running in circles, everything is the same. There are smags and snares that will kill you, but if you know WHAT to be aware of, you can avoid it.
The five characters each have distinct personality traits and skills are utitlized to help them towards an exit. They eventually stumble on math theories based on numbers between doorways. They soon discover that these numbers are equations based on Cartesian geometry that can help one to understatd the design of the entire cube. This eventually only proves to be half right, while the larger scope is to break down a 9 digit number into factorials. If we recall Abbot's ""Flatland"", we can appreciate this in the sense of perception. That when the world is flat, everything is 2 dimensional. That is what the world of Cartesian geometry implies. To move forward, one needs to begin to think in three-dimensions and understand the whole from all points of view, and not just front/back. Once our young heroine discovers this, she has the ability to know where the exit is.
The film in general is predictable, because the point was less to find out the exit of the cube and more to explore the existential questions of existence. Whether this be through logic, emotion or the senses, the characters begin to unravel and show their own true colors, and their own meanings. Its a sort of logotherapy set in a world by Samuel Beckett.
""Cube"" offers many philosphical debates for the viewer who is interested in taking the time to examine its message, but if you are looking for home-spun entertainment, then you will be let down. If not from its heavy-handed philosophy, then by its monotony. I did not like the film entirely because it put the viewer in a double bind: to expect the audience to accept the alien world we are tossed in, yet if you did not enjoy the film because there was nothing to relate to, then you would be missing the point. But I expected that.",1026691200,,2907,4.592307692307692

If the opening scene doesn't grab your attention, then don't even bother watching the rest of the movie, cause it's not for you. But if you want to follow this cast of characters further into the Cube, prepare for a roller coaster of human emotion.
I don't care what anyone says, the acting in this movie is top notch. That's right, TOP NOTCH. Each member of this no-name cast portrays his or her character in such a way that you are always second guessing their motives. It isn't until the end, whether it be of the movie or their lives, that we see who they really are. Anyone who has enough knowledge of movies and acting can respect the performances given, anyone who doesn't, cannot.

I can't believe that they let the actor who plays Quentin be in this film. He almost singlehandedly ruins it with melodramatic ruminations pockmarked with wide eyes and cheesy vocalizations.
Fortunately, though, other characters take over the story late in the film. The whole prime numbers/prime powers thing is priceless. It's confusing enough to drive the suspense, but intelligent enough to make the whole thing work.

997340,5,6305238065,"This movie has a lot of things going for it.
First, it's really intense, with pull-out-all-the-stops gore and great effects. The plot progresses with startling twists of character and piles of unanswered speculation. Some reviewers have criticized the film for having two-dimensional personalities. This doesn't apply to ""Cube"": for though fear and paranoia make characters simpler, the dynamic of all the characters was serviceable at worst, realistic at best.
Character droning is not applicable to horror films except in particularly bad cases of it (See ""Bats"" or ""Supernova"").
Two, it is philosophically relevant, on par with Sartre's ""No Exit"". Cube presents insights into social and ethical philosophy through the voices of the characters, and takes a long and hard look at human nature through their actions and their gradual disintegration.

997341,5,6305238065,I First saw Cube on the Sci Fi Channel and let me say that it was a good Sci fi but it also made me feel paranoid like what if someday a person creates something like The Cube and everyday people are put in it to see how they would survive.

997342,3,6305238065,"There was a reviewer who said many of these synopses miss the point and for the most part I agree with him. He argued that the characters were allegories for six common types of people: the militiristic, conceited leader, the book smart nerd who lacks common sense, the nihilist, the paranoid care giver, the innocent, somewhat ignorant, child, and the hardened criminal who cares only about himself. Like I said, he's right, but I think he oversimplifies the issue. The cube itself is an allegory. An allegory of the world we live in (yes, I realize that it was meant to look like someone's concept of hell, but who can prove that the Earth we reside on isn't someone's concept of hell?). This brings me to my most important metaphysical point. A lot of people--both reviewers in this forum as well as friends I've discussed this film with--get hung up on the fact that we never learn who constructed this cube and let this hang up negatively affect their opinion of this flick. I say that's silly because it shouldn't matter who constructed it. Nevermind the fact that the dialogue dismisses the concern by saying, let's remember that the cube is an allegory of the earth. And the characters in the film ask the same questions that philosophers have been asking for centuries: who created this? what is the point? how do we succeed and ascend? what ethical code do we need to obey? But just as all of these philosophers can't answer these questions, either can the characters. And if they could answer the questions, the allegory would be ruined, and the movie would fail.
But that's enough philosophical babble. Let's consider the film itself. Many say these characters aren't developed. I don't agree. Each character has their own personality and each character is affected differently by the cube. One goes completely insane, one gets angry and determined, another is resolved to solve the riddle, and another is convinced it can't be solved. Are these characters 3 dimensional; maybe not. But that doesn't matter. We see as much of these people as they could ever be expected to reveal of themselves in front of perfect strangers in a situation such as this. Another common complaint is the dialogue, the writing. Dialogue is a tricky thing, but it was written very well here and I don't understand the complaint.
Where the movie fails for me is the ending. I don't see it's point. All of the metaphyisical and allegorical objectives of the flick were already achieved. It had already shown us that we need to work together, rather than against each other, if there's any hope to saving the human race. It had shown us that we need to look for and find the intrinsic value of person we meet, rather than assuming some are worse than others. All the ending does is succumb to traditional horror methods, and weakens the overall effect of the movie.
Technically speaking, the camara angles do a remarkable job of further developing the cube's claustophobic effects. The sound design and music are chilling and flawless. The lighting is kind of hokie and some the shot frames a little cliched--though others are inventive.
If not for the end, I'd say this is a four (simply because I almost never give fives) considering the budget they had to work with.",1019779200,3,3257,4.776595744680851
997343,4,6305238065,"This is another film which allows for different experiences on subsequent viewings, making it hard to come up with an answer to the question: what's it like? What can be said is that it is highly intelligent, very imaginative story-telling, low-budget, but not suffering because of this, and deservedly fitting into a category all of its own. It is also cheesy, beautifully overblown, and is sure to become a camp classic.
The first time you see it, Cube is a remarkable stroke of genius. Every minute is filled with tension to the extent that it becomes almost unbearable to watch. The possibilities of the environment the filmmakers have created far exceeds what you would normally expect from a sci-fi, and the amount they are able to draw out of what is essentially a character-driven `rat-in-a-maze' story is applaudable. But - and it's a big but - the second time you watch it, you start to notice how over-the-top the performances are. This isn't to the detriment of the film, but makes it a totally different movie. Gone is the tension and ingenuity, and in its place are a number of actors hamming it up to perfection, and enticing you to laughter every time their various neuroses blow up in their faces - the paranoid, the psychotic, the nihilist. The actor who plays the autistic character has definitely watched Rainman one time too often, and Leaven flits between chronic fear and rampant bitchiness so many times it's high entertainment. It makes you cheer, laugh, and thoroughly enjoy a film that it is clear the filmmakers had great fun making. At least, I hope that was their intention, because if they are playing it straight, as a serious film, something went seriously awry along the way!
Overall, Cube is a great film to watch, as something tense and entirely original, or as something just to laugh with and enjoy. Sometimes you do wish that more people had been caught in the traps, just to see what other ideas the filmmakers had in their bag of tricks, but that is not something upon which to criticise the film.

The production value of the film is much more sophisticated and expensive, but with the banal characterization, lugubrious dialogue and a complete absence of tension or suspense, it becomes morose and draggy, a time-waster that fails to deliver much of anything.
The film opens with a disturbing scene in which a man, trapped in a square room with a single door on each wall, enters into another room and becomes divided into identical pieces. As we leave this grotesque scene, we enter another room, where a group of people are waking up to find themselves trapped in a maze, with time running against them as they must find their way to the outer shell of the superstructure and escape before dying from malnourishment.
The individuals among them are not that intriguing: there's edgy cop Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), who takes charge of their quest; Worth (David Hewlett), who knows more about the structure than he's willing to tell; Leaven (Nicole de Boer), whose skills in mathematics serve to help them find which rooms are safe; Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), part humanitarian, part feminist; and a retard who causes more trouble than he prevents.
Throughout the course of this bland story, the dialogue serves little other purpose than to give us the illusion that something interesting is at hand. From a convoluted explanation for the cube's existence to the various stages of schizophrenia that begin to warp their minds as they find one another unbearable, there is nothing that ever really grabs our attention.
The so-called action itself is never quite action, either, composed primarily of our group making their way through the rooms, solving different puzzles only to be perplexed by new ones, and a few incidental and purposeful deaths that aren't shocking, only ludicrous due to the fact that the story sets each one character up to live or die before the end comes. There are no surprises to be had, and even the few plot twists concerning the numerical meanings connected to the rooms are as bland as baby food.
There is one memorable scene, as our group comes across a sound-activated room that, when disturbed, becomes a living pincushion. Each person must exercise extreme silence when going through to the next room, and the scene has the prominence of being the sole scene charged with any amount of energy or suspense. This scene gives off the impression that ""Cube"" has the makings of a better movie, but fails to capitalize on it.",1006646400,,2534,4.922897196261682

997447,4,6305238065,"I don't quite agree with what Kenneth John Taylor said about the movie in his review:
1. He gave away too much of the plot of the movie, especially the ending... he spoilt the movie for those who've read his review but not yet seen the movie.
2. He said the system couldn't be evil, and the system just IS. But come on, it's inside the system that people became irrational and nervous, and as a result of that, they started killing each other. No system would, of course, do the killings with its own... what, hands?? But it's in the sense that it induced evil doings that the system is said to be evil.
3. Yes, maybe there's really no big brother watching them from above. But it does not mean the people have their lives in their own hands. They are inside this system which none of them can change single-handedly. They all have to cooperate with each other if they are to have any hope of escaping it. But the system makes it difficult for them to act collectively. So the tragic outcome is never really in doubt.
In my opinion, Kenneth John Taylor, as well as many others, has often distorted a basic fact of life. They tend to put the blame on individuals (accusing them of being evil) whenever evil things happen. But that's not often true. The blame should be on the system which we are living in.
The system is continuously shaped by and affected all of us living inside it. When an evil thing happens, it is tempting for the outsiders to just blame those who are involved, as if the outsiders can legitimately distance themselves from the sin. But it is not so easy:
i) all of us have to be partly responsible for the bad things that happen inside the system because the system is constructed by no single individual, but virtually by all of us together (though not collectively);
ii) if there is a time when the outsiders are really faced with the desperate situations, they then may no longer be able to so clearly distinguish between ""evil"" and ""self-defence."" The system makes it tough for them.
How could Kenneth John Taylor (and many others) refuse to believe that he's (they're) also represented by one of the six types of people depicted in the movie? Remember in the end, almost all got killed. Who can confidently say he could do better than the others and escape the cube???",1004140800,7,2295,4.479713603818616

This is NOT the standard thriller that it could have been, with a director who thought tossing some common intellectual concepts in redeemed a weak script and shoddy filmmaking >COUGH< David Fincher >COUGH<.
Basically, if you need a high concept version, this is the Twilight Zone episode ""Six Characters in Search of an Exit"" with more style, more inventiveness...and the ending has the same effect, and if you've seen that episode (admittedly it's hard to forget) you know what THAT means.

The main reason I felt like reviewing it is to respond to some earlier reviews that claim that this film is pointless because it leaves too many questions unanswered. This movie actually reminded me quite a bit of 20th century French theatre.  I am especially reminded of Sartre's No Exit, which was a play about a couple of strangers who end up in hell and realize that they must deal with an eternity together.  Mix that with a little Beckett and a lot of Kafka (esp. the Trial), and a little post-Cold War dread, and you have this film.  Naturally, there are some flaws, which have been pointed out: second-rate acting, and third-rate characterizations (as if each person was a simple cliche).  Those are major complaints in a film this bleak. Nevertheless, I thought the film was an excellent evocation of the absurdity of life, and I was very pleased that there was no ""answer"" at the end of it.

997502,4,6305238065,"This film illustrates one of the defining (to me) notions of art - the mastery of a small, elegant skill set. For example - chess mastery is a great art because the number of moves and rules in chess is small, while the number of possible games are almost incomputably large. This self-described ""action"" film was made on a shoestring, with a one-and-one-half room set, 7 actors and a very few special effects shots. Within this framework, the filmmakers managed to create an engaging, very suspenseful film. The characterizations tend toward the iconic rather than the individual, but different sides of the ""iconic"" personalities are developed.  For example, the strong, alpha-male character being alternately strong and protective and violent and bullying. Some of the subtext (and indeed, the text) is self-consciously ""political"" in a way that navel-gazers might find compelling. Your Reviewer finds the use of  politically loaded terms like ""military-industrial complex"" in filmic dialog pretentious and mood-spoiling, inviting as it does reflexive identification in the audience with or against a character or characters, thus reducing characters to stereotypes and audience members to constituencies. The strong acting, however, keeps audience sympathy. This really pays off because the lack of  a ""big name"" star left the writers free to kill off any of the characters at any time, raising the stakes and the suspense beyond most mainstream films. For this, I forgive speechifying and occasional lapses (okay, just one REALLY BAD lapse near the end) into Hollywood-style schlock-shocks. The overall premise of the film, however, obeys the greatest dramatic law (IMHO), in that it obeys its own rules - and those rules involve some pretty hefty math, which the producers give the audience credit enough to comprehend. Most Hollwood films can't even keep their own rules. This film does. Well shot, good production values, acceptable characterizations and dialog, and well-developed, suspensful plot makes this a definite should-see film, especially for aspiring filmmakers. I know Blockbuster stocks this film, and NOBODY rents it.  Be one of the few and check it out.  Oh - also of note, the commentary track is excellent.

997506,2,6305238065,"Shot on a budget of only 365,000 dollars and taking place in only 2 adjacent rooms that light up in different colors, this 1997 independent film is about six total strangers who wake up one day in a giant maze of interlocking cubical chambers.  These people include a cop, a doctor, an escape artist, a building designer, a mathematician, and an autistic person (who doesn't come until later).  They don't know why they've been put in there, but without any food or water, they don't have long to survive, especially when they find that the maze is riddled with deadly traps.  As they use their skills to work together to find their way out, they also try to find reasons why they've been imprisoned in the Cube.
Sounds cool, doesn't it?  One is tempted to write a rave review on this film just because of its unique plot.  There's no denying that ""Cube"" is a very interesting movie, and it seems like a rather promising one from the beginning.  Unfortunately, the film just doesn't blow your mind the way you'd expect it to. The acting, writing, and directing all have amateurism oozing out of their ears.
All six of the characters in the film are named after prisons, but that's about as much thought that was put into them as it gets.  There was no detailed history of the characters before they woke up in the Cube.  Consequently, they are so flat and illogical that I really felt no sympathy towards those that do succumb to the Cube.  I was especially unimpressed with Maurice Dean Wint's performance as the exceptionally high-strung and unlikable cop.  Oh, and did I mention that it took the mathematician about 5 seconds to figure out whether or not the number 676 is prime?
*sigh* All right, if you overlook the flat-as-a-pancake acting, you might actually feel some suspense in the first half of the film.  This notably comes into place when the prisoners have to make their way through a room where the slightest noise triggers a deadly matrix of spikes to emerge.  That's another good thing about the movie--cool special effects.  But from the midpoint and onward, the film really loses its sense of suspense and gets just plain lame when the autistic guy supplies his astronomical mathematic abilities to try to figure out the way the Cube works.  Wow, I never saw that one coming!  And another gripe: the film's incoherent dialogue also tries way too hard to be philosophical and just winds up being vague, particularly in the last few minutes of the film.
Which brings me to the ending.  The ending is not only predictable, but also wholly unsatisfactory.  I won't give it away, but it leaves you feeling cheated even if for some reason you enjoyed everything else in the film.  In the end, you still have no answer to some of the most basic questions raised by the film, particularly those that you first think of when the film begins.
What it all boils down to is that this film just isn't as intriguing, suspenseful, or profound as it seems to think it is.  Despite courageous effort and some neat visuals, you can practically taste the amateurism of the director(s) and actors.  Leave this independent film on the shelf at your local video store, and just watch ""The Matrix"" for the millionth time instead.",989020800,3,3225,4.67433628318584

To me, the unpredictability of the cube resembles the personalities of its prisoners. It is also (as so many here have stated before) a metaphoric representation of the world, life and the society today (people thrown inside a cube with no real reason...mildly existential).  The Cube is fairly a good movie, much better than most sci-fi movies I've seen lately. The shortcomings, however, were painfully present. First of all, the acting: The ""cop""-character was so overdone, so ""action film character"". His ""scary"" expressions and furious emotional explosions were hilarious. Then the psychologist, Holloway, again, nerve stretching over-acting. Other actors were fine, altough Worth's nihilism was at some points a bit pretentious. Second, the deeper meaning of the story and the characters remained, if not hollow, at least rather vague. There was some depth to the conversations and so on, but it seems like the director had wanted to make a bit more accessible movie of this story, which could have been so much more (quite sad, really).

A few things I didn't like about the film however, include the cop character going beserk, which seems unrealistic given that his daily job would require him to be resourceful.

The movie can be described either as a cyberpunk version of Sartre's *Huis Clos*, with the same cast of generally unlikable, irritating and semi-hysterical characters, or as a post-modern episode of the *Twilight Zone* set inside a Rubik's Cube. I listened to most of the (very enthusiastic) audio commentary, and although I was particularly impressed by the filmmakers' resourcefulness, it didn't teach me much about the point of the movie, which I believe to be nonexistent: *Cube* should probably be seen as a stylistic composition by film students who have absorbed tons of movies by Sam Raimi, Roman Polanski, Hitchcock, Ozu and Dario Argento (among the various directors mentioned in the commentary). It is a self-absorbed movie, which does not have much to say about the world-out-there (apart from its surprisingly benevolent view of technology) but rather seems trapped within its own references and internal correspondences.

Yes, it sounds cheesy, and yes it's teeming with clichs. The opening scenes of the film don't exactly do a good job allaying fears that this movie will seriously suck, with some rotten dialogue and overwrought acting (the latter may be attributable to the fact that we are not familiar with these actors and therefore less forgiving in regards to their shortcomings). However, the premise of the movie alone should be enough to hook you and give you the patience to stick with it. If you do, you'll be happy after the film's 90 minute length has passed.
The movie quickly goes through a weird change, with interpersonal character reactions becoming more realistic, dialogue becoming more believable, and the tension increasing considerably. As the characters navigate the deadly construction, tension mounts as everyone's true nature is revealed. (Naturally, a situation like this will bring out the best -- and worst -- in anybody). The emphatic acting succeeds in garnering the viewer's utmost interest, almost as if he is the seventh member of the imprisoned party. When a trap is avoided, one feels a profound sense of gladness and relief. When the characters come to a point of desperation, the viewer naturally responds with a similar sense of despondency. At times the plot seems predictable, but there are enough unexpected twists to keep one guessing. Emotionally charged moments of character interaction match the breathless intensity of the trap scenes, which is very impressive.
The story line isn't too concerned with how the characters got there, or why. This is a tasteful decision, as I think too many explanations would have diluted the sense of intensity and the striking drama. Technically, the movie is also very well done. The set design is imposingly impressive in an almost creepy manner, with camera angles providing a good sense of claustrophobia.

Then it really starts. The acting gets much better, or maybe you just didn't know how to enjoy it from the start. While the story gets more and more thrilling, the 'cube-people' show more and more of their personnality. You love them. You fear for them. You have your personal favorite among the team, or you admire one for its behaviour...  These people exhibit patterns you surely have seen before. And then, you start to realize they behave like some people you know or have met.... in small touches or in the 'big picture'. This is the most exciting thing about 'Cube'.

The ending is really confusing and a total screw job.  is the retarded guy actually out of the cube or was it just a whole other room that was bright.  I also didn't like the way they made eveyone except for one person die.

997587,3,6305238065,"Cube is a very interesting movie.  The cinematography is, at times, brilliant.  Nicole de Boer's use of extreme camera angles provides us with some telling moments.  At other times, though, this film looks like a bad TV movie.  The special effects are excellent at times, but very amateurish at other times.  The plot is incredibly straight-forward.  The cast is comprised of a massive seven people.  This was possibly the simpliest set ever created: it's simply one room repeated again and again.  Getting worried?  Well, then this movie has achieved it's purpose.  The best thing I can say about this movie is that it plays on its own terms, not yours.  If you're looking for a plot with a solid resolution, then look elsewhere.  The idea is compelling, the characters are, despite what some other reviews say, fairly complex (examine, if you will, the stereotypical ""protagonist"" and his development), and the deaths are creative, to say the least.  Most importantly, there are some very tense and compelling scenes in this movie.  It is interesting and it is worth viewing.  Rent the DVD before you by it though.  This film is by no means a must have, but the opening scene does have to be seen to be believed.  All I can say is ""ouch.""",971568000,,1240,4.746478873239437

Then  she turns her attention to the next number, 372. An even number! Yet, it  took her 3 seconds to conclude that it is not a prime.
After that, she  needs an autistic 'genius' in order to be able to count the prime factors  of a 3-digit integer. Come on, every child could do that.
And yet, she  somehow deciphers the coordinates of the rooms by 'decoding' three numbers.  Not only the coordinates, but also the trajectory the room follows in time.

997592,5,6305238065,"Just because filmmakers of the Cube, having a low budget, filmed it in a single room doesn't mean that it is a B sci-fi.  To tell the truth I have  never seen a plot so original as in Cube.  Some may think that it is boring  to watch; I have to disagre with anyone who dislikes Cube because it is one  intelligent creation that leaves us, attentive viwers, in a deep  contemplative mood and with a long lasting impression.  Cube is unique  bcause it provides insights into human behavior.  It is the movie that  shows how several strangers deal with a dangerous situation and a position  where they need to learn to cooperate in order to survive.
The plot is  simple but unusual.  A small group of strangers found themselves in a death  trap or an extremely elaborate labyrinth of interconnected cubical rooms  with lethal traps in some of them.  Different rooms that are traps contain  from elector-molecular to sound sensors and are equipped with either deadly  flame-throwers, razor sharp knives that protrude through walls, acid sprays  or something else that can brutally dismember an unsuspecting victim.  At  first there seems no order and no leads as were to go and how to avoid a  trap for our characters, which results in panic and despair.  But as time  passes they discover that pattern exists and there is a reason why  specifically each one of them is here.  There happen to be a math genius,  engineer, doctor and few other interesting individuals.  Together they try  to find a way out, and just when it seemed that they understand how the  maze is structured there comes a surprise and a disappointment with another  dose of despair.  The labyrinth is much more complicated than it appears  and it will take a huge mental and physical effort to solve it.
Without a  doubt Cube is a brilliant film with a unique idea.  I want to warn everyone  that it is extremely intense and scary at times.  I also want to point out  that people with decent math background, or someone who likes math, will  find it especially enjoying because it will be easier to understand how the  puzzling trap was solved, and the exit found.",964396800,21,2132,4.6415094339622645
997593,3,6305238065,"This is a pretty cool movie, and no surprise it wasn't a Hollywood picture, because this kind of stuff doesn't get made there. Several characters awaken inside a mysterious maze -- part labyrinth, parth  deathtrap, with hints of ""Hellraiser"" in its construction and  lethality.
Anyway, the band of characters (Quentin, Holloway, Worth,  Levan, and Kazan) try to figure their way out, dealing with the Cube and  with each other in various ways. Using only a tiny set, the makers of this  movie create a menacing, disturbing, claustrophobic mood  throughout.
Weaknesses of the movie are in the writing -- I think the  action kicks in a little too early, and the characters aren't developed  enough. But the dynamics of their relationships are entertaining to watch,  and things are never what they seem.
The movie works on several thematic  levels, being pretty allegorical -- the Cube representing life and death  itself, with the prisoners being proxies for you and me. I didn't like the  ending because of this message, not because of what happens.

Sounds boring,  right? It is. Cube is an okay film at best, but that is only if you try to  derive deeper meaning from it. I tried, I found a nugget, but I still  really wasn't all that entertained.
The main failing of the film is that  we really don't like any of the characters. I know, sometimes this is done  to make an artistic statement, well, it had better be done really well  then, because any slip up with unlikable characters produces an unlikable  movie.
I have to give Cube credit, it is a low-budget film, and the  actors do for the most part turn in nice performances. My big problem,  however, was that I just didn't care by the time it was over.",962496000,7,938,4.048913043478261

997664,3,6305238065,"First off, I have to say that I found this to be an interesting movie, with some well thought out twists and turns.  However, in places, it does tend to start to bog itself down, and you can start to feel the time just  dragging on.  Some of the traps are rather ingenius too, although I have  some reservations about the feasibility of some of them actually being able  to work the way they are portrayed to.
  Taking the acting into account  now, certainly none of the actors would win any type of award for their  performances, but I've seen B movies with much worse actors than those in  this movie, so I won't say too much bad about them.  The guy playing the  cop tended to ham it up a little too much, and one of the characters I  thought was one of the most interesting got killed much too early into the  movie.  These things happen though.
  I had almost been tempted to give  this movie four stars, but dropped it to three because of a lame reversal  type of gotcha ending.  For those that haven't seen this movie I don't want  to give too much away so I'll try to be vague.  In their travels through  the cube, we are treated to them opening the room doors many times, always  with a rather loud clicking and banging sound.  However, at the end,  someone is able to sneak into a room of other characters without them  hearing anything, no noises or anything.  Unbelievable.  For more than just  that reason too since this person had also been able to circumnavigate the  traps in the other rooms with no help which wasn't likely.
  All in all  though, I'd say this movie is at least worth the price of a rental, but not  one I'll buy to add to my collection.",961977600,,1670,4.27741935483871

Along the way, you meet  strangers who inexplicably are in the same situation. The tensions run high  as paranoia sets in. The simple fact that it is a gripping movie that  doesn't put a spotlight on special effects is tremendous. Instead it  studies the volatility of human nature and emotion. That is what this movie  is all about. The few reviews that have given this movie a poor rating,  don't truly understand it's premise. The characters are realistic. There is  no overhype since the actors are virtually unknown and do an adequate to  good job of acting (Come on, like Keanu didn't overact as Neo in  Matrix...It's still a great movie though).

997666,4,6305238065,"Is there anyone in attendance who has not seen, or does not know, the plot that has been done about a hundred times, most popularly in a truly chilling Twilight Zone episode entitled ""Five Characters in Search of  an Exit?"" A number of people (varying between two and five-- two is  the minimum you need for dialogue, and five is about the most an  existantialist can handle without getting gummed up in the works himself)  wake up in a situation they don't understand and which, in most cases, is  never explained. The focus is on the ways in which the characters interact,  although obstacles can be thrown in their way to push that interaction, but  most of the time that device is used when the author has run out of good  ideas.
  Let's take that idea and turn it on its head-- the characters  wake up in a situation, but instead of the focus being on the characters,  the focus is on the space in which they wake up, and much of their  interaction is based on figuring out what, exactly, their space consists  of, and how to survive moving around in it.
  This is the basis-- I  can't really call it, or anything else in it, a plot-- of Cube, a Sci-Fi  Channel original (interesting that some of the language is still cut out of  this). We open with a scene completely unrelated to the rest of the film  that gives us, in no uncertain terms, the idea that being in the Cube is  deadly. (Strike one, since this could easily be done by Rennes in the next  scene-- in fact, it is.) Then we meet the five original characters-- a  policeman, a doctor, an escape artist, a mathematician, and an office  worker (whose function, which is found out later on, constitutes a  spoiler)-- who find themselves in the Cube. True to form, they don't know  how they got there, where they are, etc. They spend a little time  theorizing, but not much. Both the cop and the escape artist have had  brushes with the many deadly traps to be found in the Cube. The five are  forced to band together, despite mostly hating one another, in order to  find a way out, assuming one exists.
  While the interaction between  the characters is interesting, and takes a number of twists Sartre might  never have considered (and one, in pariticular, that comes out of nowhere,  but shows the inventiveness of both one of the characters and the  scriptwriter), we spend as much time as the characters do attempting to  figure out the mechanics of the Cube itself. And if you like mathematical  puzzles (have any Jim Fixx books?), you'll have a ball with this movie.  There are enough clues for you to figure out what's going on, although I  certainly didn't. And the characters are passably (some even well-) acted,  and they act their parts the way their parts are written-- as second-stage  to the scenery.

As to the  supposed ""psychological undertones,"" it all seemed pretty  apparent.  ""Psychological overtones,"" I'd say.  Really, the only  character that broke down/flipped out was the cop.  So he's basically the  villian of the story, it's him against them.

Yet you're  superglued to the screen this entire time.  Soon you get sort of paranoid  as you're forced to stare at the interlocking, totally  identical rooms  (with difference only in their color schemes) that assemble a giant maze in the form of a cube.
This movie, in brief, is an allegory of life in all its aspects. You're stuck in a cube, you don't know who put you there and why, what your purpose is, or what you're supposed to do next. Is it God who did this to you, or is it all just a coincidence, or huge joke? Every step may be your last. You have to figure things out even though they seem pointless and unsolvable. Your choices decide your fate. Your questions are never answered to  the fullest. And all the while, social, racial, gender and other differences clash mercilessly. Sounds like life, doesn't it?
It is a film about the human nature more than  anything else. Yes, the  characters are stereotypical in some ways, and  there are clichs.

Acting is generally good, although it seems to get caught between the  ""oh my god, this is so bizarre"" and the ""well, we're here,  let's deal with it"" schools. Special effects are beautifully realised,  and will make you realise just how much more good design counts for than a  big budget.

Basically im not going  to rewrite the whole script here but, im just going to let a few things  slip to get your mind on the verge of CUBE fever.  Okay these people get  trapped in this big cube with like 17000+ rooms, (damn).  Eventually they  all meet up, exept for one in the beggining which is posibly the best  moment in the entire film, it certainly got my hopes up!  ight there was a  little description but now for the bad parts.  Okay looking from a  pesimists view thats probably didn't happen, the entire film couldve been  shot in like two rooms and a blue sceen!  Im not going against low budget  movies but the thing is a hypd up Movie like CUBE could've done so much  more for the imagination, it left no thoughts in your mind, just those of  quadrilatic equasions (people who've seen the film before will know what im  talking about), and mathmatical insights.  This film challenges your mind  against the Mathmatician of the group of Marooned citizens, there only hope  is her genuius and somone elses that they find along the way! (again people  who've seen the film know what im on  about).  If you don't like films that  make you thinki would encourage you to NOT to watch this film, as from some  peoples views it could be seen as a boring film, then again from other  peoples views it could be the best Twilight Zone type film ever made.  I  like this film thats why've given it 4 stars, i left one out because at the  end you never find out the reason why they were there or anything like  that.  But people who like strange endings which go against the plot, need  to watcth this film just for that reason! have a great time watching this  film, and i hope thjis has been at all helpful to you, thanx a lot and  Happy Holidays yall!

997776,2,6305238065,"I realize that I am going against the grain here with my two star review, but I think that this movie is WAY to overated.  The initial premise of the movie is allright I suppose, if not a bit sketchy.  However as the film  progresses it is never developed.  The key questions that are posed in the  film (why are the people there, where exactly is the cube, why were these  people choosen) are never answered at all.  Not even at the end is there  any form of revelation.  Speaking of which the hakeneyed ending left me in  a fit of frustration.  Anyway, the speacil affects (only a few are present  mind you) are nothing spectacular, but then again they really didn't need  to be.  The acting is presentable, but the characters all seem to be rather  one dimensional.  I suppose that my over all beef with this movie is that  it could have been so much more.  After all it had a good set of actors  (who ALL die except for one), a decent plot (at the beginning anyway), and  a mysterious mood (which is entertaining at first, but quickly gets old).  I think that maybe if this was a one-hour made for tv movie i could stomach  it, but as a feature length movie it leave much to be desired.",944352000,2,1190,4.2657657657657655
997777,5,6305238065,"A mixed group of people wake up to find that they are confined in a 3D maze of cube-shaped rooms with horrific traps in some and not in others.
This movie has a highly unusual premise in the sense that you don't know  HOW or WHY but you just know that it IS and it must be dealt with -  confused?  See the movie and you will understand.
One facet of this movie  is a play on the idea that we might have no idea why something is, but we  find that we have to deal with it anyway.  In this case, the characters are  in a perilous situation, where doing nothing means death by starvation and  doing something is likely to also result in death by ghastly trap.
The  characters seem fairly stereotypical and the acting is a bit lame to begin  with, but perseverence in watching this movie results in a genuinely  disturbing experience.  The absorbed viewer will feel hope, despair, joy,  horror, anger, extreme tension and more - the feeling of being trapped,  isolated and slowly going paranoid has rarely been manipulated so well as  in this movie.  Ironic then that all the action takes place in an  inexplicable and stifling rat's maze where very little is explicitly shown  to the viewer, and yet so much is implicitly revealed in the interactions  of the trapped people and how they come to terms with their  plight.
Highly recommended to anyone who really likes their movies and  not recommended to those who prefer their thought of the day handed to them  on a plate.",942278400,52,1470,4.467924528301887

997829,2,6305238065,"Its the familiar ""we must work together"" plot.  They even have an actor say that we were all put here for a reason.  However, they never highlight the skills that each has.  2 of them have the same skill, duh...  only 1 skill is required to escape so why do they have to work  together?
Throughout the movie they keep asking themselves what are we  doing here and what should we be doing to get out.  They never answer those  questions.  They keep asking who put us here, but they never find  out.
Why do the rooms have different Xs, and what does each X represent?  Why does so and so dislike rooms with this X, never told... The police  officers transformation is unexplained and his behavior does not  follow.
The engineers lack of a desire to live is unexplained.
Why does  X let Y die? How did Y know X family history? Was Y indeed correct? How did  X know Y personal information, was X correct?
The deaths are unnecesary  and don't increase the level of o-sh! tness (desperation).
Look, these  questions are not your ""food for thought"" type of questions.  They(the acting) begg you to ask these questions and they intertwine them  in the plot and actions of the characters, yet they never answer  them...
The idea is great and i was following the solution of the puzzle  which was also great.  I thought wow when they figured it out.  The acting  was also pretty good as I was sucked into this thing all the way.  Like i  said, they had me asking all kinds of questions about the characters which  came from the good acting, but...

3) Does only the truly innocent survive?  Are they the  only ones to ""Make it to the light?""  Could this possibly be a  reference to the afterlife?
4) In the future (or present) do we have to  rely on others to survive in our environment?  How important is the  perception to find the strengths and weaknesses in others?
5) How  important is teamwork without selfish motivations?
6) It is never  explained how they arrived in the cube.  Is this a reference to being  born?

997960,5,6305238065,"From the marketing and packaging I was expecting the genre ""strangers in danger"" flick with some kind of low budget SF twist.  Brainless entertainment for a bad night, in other words.  To my surprise this turned  out to be an unusual and very interesting little film.
It makes no  apologies for its low budget (one set, some lights, and some models).  The  film works more as theatre than film (fulfills the traditional unities,  etc) and has an ""actors' workshop"" atmosphere rather than the  ""beauty contest"" ambience of a lot of low budger actioners.  The  actors are working on acting rather than on their hair.  In other words,  this film has the feel of an honest dramatic effort.
The script, not the  FX, is what drives the film. It's mostly good writing, offering a fair  amount of surprises, some philosophical ventures, and even a little  literary style (what a concept).  Whether intentionally or not, the film  deconstructs the Hollywood actioner scene by scene.  Central to this  deconstruction is of course the crumbling facade of the Schwarzenegger-like  ""hero"", as the script reveals more and more home truths about the  kind of bully boys that Hollywood persists in glorifying.
This film is  being sold under false pretences:  it's way, way better than the niche  where it's being marketed.  The 'Quentin' character seems uneven and at  times overacted, but hey, at its worst it's better acting than you'll ever  get out of di Caprio or Shue!

7885648,5,6305238065,"Cube: Cube is a story of six or so people who wake up in a... well... cube. On each side of the cube (including above and below), there are doors that lead to other cubes. Some of the cubes have deadly traps. There are three etched three-digit numbers on each cube that may provide a clue whether a particular cube is deadly and may also provide a clue on how to escape. Can the figure a way out without getting killed before they succumb to starvation or thirst or are simply driven mad?

The Good: I have a lot of pet peeves in movies. One of the biggest is films that explain everything to the audience as if we were dimwitted fourth graders. The Cube explains nothing. I love this. We can decide which of the characters speculations are correct or even if any of them are. This creates a wonderfully engaging film.

The film is well written with some excellent character arcs. Some of the characters are a little on the trope side of the equation (I am looking your way Rain Man) but overall it is an engaging group. There is a nice argument between just moving forward one cube at a time and the idea of trying to figure out what it all means. The movie really doesnt take sides once again allowing the viewer to decide which approach is best.

The special effects are actually quite good when they make an appearance and the set keeps one's interest for the relatively brief running time.

The Bad: The movie plays its room trap cards pretty early in a truly spectacular way. One wishes they had revisited that a bit more throughout the film. The film also suffers a little from the we ran out of cannon fodder too soon syndrome.

It really isn't that hard to figure out is a three digit number is prime. If it is an even number or ends in a five it isn't prime as an example. Our so-called math expert in the group took way to long to figure some of these out.

In Conclusion: This is a great example of how to make a low budget film with only seven actors, one set, and an engaging interesting script. The last part is a nut plenty of big-budget movies have yet to crack. Like the early Saw films, Cube is greater than the sum of its parts and a wonderful example of minimalism in a film.",1523750400,,2196,4.279518072289156
