8015698,5,B0001O3YTE,"This is it!! If you started collecting from the first DVD release, then you know it wasn't a journey but a struggle. Warner Bros releases of this cartoon were tortue. They released the series in no particular order. Like 1977 was first, 1983 second then maybe 1980 then 1985 show and given stupid names like ""Lost episodes"". The only thing lost were our patients. Arrrghhh!! but here it is. I made a list for those who want them in original airing dates.

8015705,4,B0001O3YTE,"3-dis set which contains ""Challenge of the Superfriends: United They Stand"", ""Challenge of the Superfriends: Attack of the Legion of Doom"", and ""Justice League"" (pilot).
Good stuff, especially for JLA comic book fans.  Kinda irritating that these 2 series are being released piecemeal (and if you find yourselves buying the Justice League 3-pack you will end up having 2 copies of the Justice League pilot!!!!).  Anyway am looking forward to buying the season 1/ complete set of ""Challenge of the Superfriends"".  Plus am hoping that they come out with season/ boxed sets of Justice League as well.",1088467200,53,597,5.134020618556701
