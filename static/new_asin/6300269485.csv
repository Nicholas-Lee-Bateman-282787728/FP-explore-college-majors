287004,5,6300269485,"Robert Ellis Miller's film version of ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" is decent and straightforward, but what makes it a classic is the performance of Alan Arkin as deaf-mute John Singer. Arkin's performance moved me to tears in 1968, and subsequent viewings confirm my conviction that Arkin gives here one of the greatest performances ever recorded on film. Why has Arkin's work in ""Heart"" been so thoroughly forgotten? When ""Premiere"" magazine a few years ago did an article on actors throughout screen history playing handicapped characters, it completely ignored Arkin, although his performance was Oscar-nominated. ""Heart"" also contains fine early performances by stars-in-the-making Stacy Keach and Cicely Tyson, as well as a performance (also Oscar-nominated) by Sondra Locke that far exceeded anything she did afterward. But it is Arkin who dominates this film, and those who see his performance will cherish it forever.",993254400,91,927,5.444444444444445
287005,3,6300269485,"This is a good movie.  Alan Arkin is magnificent, and every other actor in the film is at least very good.  There are great scenes, important messages, basic humanity - well portrayed with all its evil and all its glory.
It is not ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.""
The movie's focus is on one relationship, the one between John Singer and Mick Kelly.  It almost ignores important characters like Biff Brannon, whose character is ever present in the novel, and turns Jake Blount's character into a bit part.  The movie takes extraordinary, and unnecessary, liberties with the many plots and relationships.
Advice to buyers:  If you have neither read the book nor seen the movie, watch the movie first - that way you won't be disappointed by it.  If you have seen the movie but not read the book, read the book.  Its reputation is well deserved, and you'll probably read it again some day.  If you've read the book, and are considering watching the movie:  Don't.",986515200,12,959,4.660714285714286
287006,4,6300269485,"Purchased and viewed on a recommendation. This movie was a nice surprise. Not what I expected. ""Heart of a Lonely Hunter"" takes you inside a deaf man's world during the time of Civil Rights. John Singer a deaf-mute, Played by Alan Arkin, must hold a card that speaks for him. It reads, ""I am a deaf-mute. I read lips and understand everything that is being to me. Please do not shout.""
It was interesting... in the begining, I reguarded that ""simple"" card as a prop in a movie. Soon, at least for me. The card with the ""simple"" statements became a seperate character all its own.
The draw Alan Arkin has playing Singer to both the cast and the audience is remarkable. I felt myself drawn to John Singer, the character from the begining. This is do to what Arkin brought to the screen in the way of, sincerity to his character and good Samaritan helpfulness. I have not experienced anything like it since Melissa Gilbert played ""Helen Keller,"" in the 1979 version of, ""The Miracle Worker.""
Singer's believe ability as a character, I think is what earned Arkin an Academy Award nomination.""Heart of a Lonely Hunter"" also marks the movie debuts of Sandra Locke and Stacy Keach.

287007,5,6300269485,"When I was very young, I saw this movie on an old projector at a school for the deaf.  The lights were dim, the audience was very focused on the film because it was a rare story about deaf people and mutes.  The story  had many subplots and gripped our hearts and souls....  after the movie was  over and the reel was clicking away, we turned up the lights.... to find  that everyone had tears in their eyes, from the very young to the aged...  we turned the lights back down... then slowly, after what seemed like an  eternity, the lights went up and the audience began signing to each other -  to their family members - to their friend..... Perhaps this also made the  movie more endearing to me, but I have always believed it to be an  excellent film - very poignant, and yet very often forgotten.  Arkin became  our hero, our lost soul, our friend.... forever and ever...  When you watch  this, invite friends over, or share with a friend, it is truly a memorable  classic!",962236800,13,977,4.374301675977653

287009,5,6300269485,"HEART is an extremely touching film that can really rip out your heart.  Arkin portrays a man full of kindness and love who does nothing but give to others and, in so doing, tremendously influences their lives.  He gives  much but does not receive back from them what he needs to sustain an  existence that is at its core so very lonely.  The last two scenes are  incredibly moving.  Interesting early or first performances for Cicely  Tyson, Stacey Keach, Sondra Locke and Arkin is superb.",921283200,6,490,4.682352941176471
287040,5,6300269485,"An adaptation of the Carson McCullers novel of the same name, ""The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter"" explores the themes of loneliness and alienation as the central character John Singer (a deaf mute played by Alan Arkin) interacts with a young girl (Sondra Locke), an alcoholic (Stacey Keach), and a black physician (Percy Rodrigues).

This was Sondra Locke's first movie role and she earned an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. Alan Arkin also earned an Oscar nomination for best actor. I am usually disappointed with film adaptations of novels, but this is an instance where the film was every bit as good as the novel.

287087,5,6300269485,"I remember when I was 10 years old in 1977, and this film made its television debut on NBC. My parents and I were looking through the TV Guide for something to watch the night it premiered, and you couldn't tell much from the description in the ""Guide"", but it looked like the best thing to watch that particular evening...I didn't know it at the time, but it was an evening that would forever change my life.

I had never seen a film more moving nor a performance more outstanding (by Alan Arkin) in all my life. To this day, it remains my favorite film of all time.

I also loved the score by Dave (""David"" when the film was made in 1968) Grusin. I decided that very night what I wanted to be when I grew up...a film composer, and indeed I did. I never lost sight of that dream, and had the distinct pleasure of meeting Mr. Grusin when I attended Berklee College of Music after I left high school in the mid '80s...I told him how much his score and this film had changed my life, and that it was my favorite of all his scores...He was very kind and told me that it was his favorite too.

I also remember writing to Alan Arkin after having had such a moving experience with ""Heart""...It was back in the days when you could go to the back of a comic book or whatever, and see ads where, for just $1.99, you could purchase a book of the real addresses of the stars (not just c/o Warner Bros, etc)...So I got Mr Arkin's address, and wrote to him telling how much I loved his performance in ""Heart""...A couple of weeks later, he actually wrote back to me, and thanked me very much for my interest in his film.

One thing I remember being interesting. I had already seen the NBC network premier of ""Heart"", and always kept watch in the TV Guide for a re-run...It just so happened that I saw where the film was going to be playing again on some particular night, and was greatly looking forward to seeing ""My Favorite Film"" once again...It also just so happened, though, that it was on the same night that ""Star Wars"" was premiering at our local cinema, and my parents wanted to go see that, and they couldn't, at 10 years old, leave me home alone...I remember reluctantly going with them...The line was way around the block for ""Star Wars"", and once we got in, the place was packed to capacity and they had to actually turn people away.

I never despised a movie more in my life. After sitting through about the first 20 minutes of this sci-fi /fantasy junk, I starting almost YELLING at my parents to take me home to see my favorite movie of all time!!...I'm sure I was the only kid in that theater, or ANY theater for that matter, to rather be home watching a drama about a deaf mute than seeing the premier of ""Star Wars""!!...I don't remember how I managed to sit through ""Wars"", but to my recollection, I MUST have somehow because I remember my parents wouldn't take me home to see ""Heart""...(Man, if only we had VCRs in 1977, I would have been all set) !!!...But at least today, we can actually OWN movies and watch them whenever we want in the privacy of our own homes!!...So now, I have a home theater with ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" DVD on display, along with Dave Grusin's soundtrack on CD...and I'm in heaven...just like back in 1977.

By the way, I have NEVER owned a copy of ""Star Wars""...LOL !!

287140,3,6300269485,"Arkin is good, Locke is very good, the film is pretty good. But so much is missing from the book. Jake Blount, an extremely interesting and complicated character in the book, is reduced to simple drunk/lout. And the film fumbles a key scene that should have been very easily done, when Blount is drunk and talking to everybody in the cafe, and no one is listening, and he finally finds someone who'll listen -- Singer -- unaware he's talking to a mute.

The cafe owner in the book -- again, very interesting and complicated individual. In the film? Nothing. He's The Cafe Owner. He wears an apron. The black doctor's political beliefs and rantings in the book -- gone.

So, from the book, we're left with Mick (Locke) and Singer, and whatever narrative fireworks they chose to keep -- the fight at the carnival, the party, Willie losing his foot, etc. But the film doesn't work for me because there's not enough of what's left to make it work, and what is left -- Mick's interest in music, her desperately wanting to be someone -- isn't made the most of.",1377302400,4,1054,4.542105263157895

287142,3,6300269485,I loved this movie for the acting and story about friendships and loneliness.  I was a little confused when I received it and all the printing on the case was in Korean - probably because it was made in Korea.  Just surprised.,1368057600,,226,4.357142857142857
287143,4,6300269485,"The renowned Douglas Sirk once opined that directors should avoid filming great books, because the films would never match up with people's expectations.  That seems to be the case with ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"", which like a number of films from the late 60's, suffers from a case of over-earnestness.

Still, though it is overbusy trying to crowd in themes of racial strife and teenage heartache and loses a little of its focus on the claustrophobic life of a deaf-mute, it remains a worthwhile movie.

That is because good performances from Alan Arkin, Stacy Keach, Sondra Locke and Chuck McCann bring a lot of life to what could have been a very formulaic setting of a Southern Gothic novel.

Much credit should also be given to the camerawork of James Wong Howe, who also filmed two other good American period pieces, ""Picnic"" and ""This Property Is Condemned"".  Howe seemed to have a knack for capturing essences of small town life in bright, clear colors.

Director Robert Ellis Miller isn't really known for films as much as for television direction.  That may be why the movie, while it remains a charming relic, never attained the classic status of other late 60's films like ""In The Heat of the Night"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"".  It's best remembered as a showcase for Arkin, who communicates so much with only body language--a skill which continued to serve him in further roles like ""Yossarian"" in ""Catch-22"".",1368057600,2,1423,4.827160493827161

I wish I could say the same for the screen play of the same name. The movie itself is tolerable but should have not carried the title of the literary work. The same names were used in the movie but that is where the comparison ends.

There is a very telling human story that evolves in the book - it is universal and it is raw. It can not be compromised or the story (and the impact of the title) can not be told.

Arkin does a good job acting as a deaf-mute [let's face it - he has no dialogue - that's a challenge for any actor] but he does not depict the deaf-mute known as Mister Singer in the written word.",1279929600,4,732,4.111888111888112
287187,3,6300269485,"Carson McCullers' first published novel instantly established her as a major American writer. Re-reading the novel it is still easy to see why--individual characters vivid in their lonely aspirations and unfulfilled yearning are set with total conviction against a deft portrayal of societal and racial tensions in a small Southern town in the 1930s.

The 1968 filming of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter could not have hoped to capture all of the elements of McCullers' frequently sprawling saga. However, viewing it today one is struck by how much has been pared away, not to the film's advantage. While the action still centers around John Singer, the deaf-mute who loses his best friend, and Mick, the gawky teenager reaching out for something beyond her prosaic existence, many of the other characters who stand out so vividly in the novel have been cut adrift or reduced almost to non-existence. In particular, Jake Blount, the drunken, politically radicalized drifter, and Portia, the embittered daughter of the rigid Dr. Copeland, are little more than ciphers as scripted. This is more the pity because actors of the stature of Stacy Keach and Cicely Tyson are thereby wasted, though they do their best with the material they have. Percy Rodriguez, as the black doctor, comes off better, and Sondra Locke as Mick (though she is noticeably too mature for the part) and Alan Arkin in the pivotal role of Singer are best of all, and certainly deserved their Oscar nominations. One can argue nowadays about the ethics of casting a hearing actor in a deaf role (particularly after a brilliant screen presence such as Marlee Matlin), but Arkin is totally convincing and immensely touching, at least to this hearing viewer.

They are saddled with a script that too often reduces McCullers' poetic language to TV-level clichs, and direction that is at best workmanlike. Only a few scenes, such as Mick's awkward, unsatisfying sexual awakening, and an ugly racial fight at a carnival, retain anything approaching the novel's evocative power. Still, the work of this fine cast makes this one still worth a look today.",1276560000,5,2111,5.045845272206304

287220,5,6300269485,"As so often happens, this movie does not, it seems, quite live up to the expectations of some reviewers who have first read Carson McCullers' acclaimed book of the same title. I have never read the book, but the movie, taken on its own merits, is a masterpiece that has been undeservedly neglected in the forty years since it first came out.
  I saw ""Lonely Hunter"" back then as a young man, and it was instantly engraved on my heart and memory, especially the final graveyard scene where in just a very few words - even one letter of one word, the past tense ""d"" in ""loved"" - reveals and drives home the principal point of the movie powerfully and unforgettably. When I saw it again on DVD after forty years, the impact was just as great. I was left in reflective and tearful silence for a good half hour afterwards.
  I regard this movie as a great modern tragedy, with a message worthy to rank with those of the great Greek and Shakespearian dramas.
The values are profound and deeply human. And through the artistry of Robert Ellis Miller's direction, that can only be fully appreciated on watching the film a second time when one now knows what every incident and gesture is leading up to, the viewer is invited by Alan Arkins's wordless but inspired performance to enter into the world of a handicapped but uncomplaining man whose life turns out to be one act of loving kindness after another toward the people around him. However, his inability to verbalize what is inside him inevitably means that he is pretty much just taken for granted by those same people - and indeed, by the viewer. That's part of the artistry.
  This is a beautiful and timeless movie, worth watching again and again.

287221,5,6300269485,"The cinematography of James Wong Howe may be the real ""star"" of this film, creating a brightly-hued, sharply-focused view of small-town America in the 1960s that is almost like looking at kodachrome still photographs. That brightness, along with the almost cheery tone in much of the acting (Chuck McCann, Sondra Locke, etc.) seem at odds with the bleakness of the material ... until, on second thought, it seems like the perfect metaphor for how the world viewed Singer, all cheerful surface. The cinematography intentionally ignores the sadness and the darkness inside these superficially cheery lives, just as everyone ignored Singer's feelings. (Only Cicely Tyson's intense performance goes straight for the dark side in this material which, in fact, makes her seem the most out-of-place member of the cast.) On a different note: I really adored Sondra Locke here. She makes a debut with a charm similar to that of Reese Witherspoon's in Man in the Moon. Since I am also a big fan of Clint Eastwood's under-rated The Gauntlet (an homage to Don Siegel that is also the first hint of Eastwood's later mastery as a director), I have to say that Sondra Locke deserves to be more than a footnote in cinema history. She was an overlooked talent.",1240444800,4,1243,4.952153110047847

John Singer (Arkin) is a deaf-mute who works in a small town jewelry store doing engraving and repairs. He also apparently has responsibility for another deaf-mute, Spiros(Chuck McCann) who continually gets into trouble with the law and is sent away to a 'facility' in another small community. Singer moves there to be close and help his friend. He rents a room from a family struggling with finances due to the father's hip injury and inability to work. He enters into the life of the teenage daughter struggling with her identity and coming of age. His disability makes him very sensitive to the needs and hurts of those around him including an African-American doctor who refuses to treat whites.

To escape loneliness, Arkin's character moves to that city, finds another job, rents a room from impoverished southern family and hopes to start a new life.

However, he cannot seem to communicate his own pain to others nor obtain comforting, love or a feeling of belonging for himself.  I took his deaf-mute character as being a symbol for the many good people in our society who ""can't quit fit-in"" due to personal or social barriers that get in the way.  This movie also shows the ultimate tragedy that occurs when people are ""forgotten.""

A young Sondra Locke is very good in her role, but does tend to ""over act"" a bit.  The other characters do a fine job with there roles.

287228,4,6300269485,"I've never read Carson McCullers' source novel but judging by this film it must be a tough translation.  A lot of Alan Arkin's work as John Singer, a deaf mute, requires him to externalize his internal pain through facial expressions and hand gestures.  That's a tall order for any actor and Arkin is among our best but somehow I think the film falls short.  Not in the perjorative sense, but with Singer's seersucker suit and crewcut and his humanitarianism I was reminded of a yesteryear Forrest Gump.  Sondra Locke is a revelation as Mick, the daughter of Singer's landlady.  Mick is a dreamer who wants to break free, as would any adolescent, from the rigidity of her surroundings.  Singer, whose prison is the handicap he is saddled with, developes an obvious kinship with Mick.  Locke is best known for her work in Clint Eastwood films, who she developed an offscreen love affair with.  I can't help but wonder whether that relationship stunted Locke's growth in films.  The film, set in the South in the late sixties, tackles issues of racism and bigotry but in nothing more than a perfunctory way.  ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" is a pleasant film that doesn't quite live up to it's lofty ambitions.",1200873600,3,1208,4.7368421052631575

Locke has the look that we now see in Sarah Polley. Alan Arkin is also great in Hunter. Some critics and fans of the book aren't fans of the film so much but the film is really well made and everyone is great. Dave Grusins score also stands out.

287250,5,6300269485,"I saw this film in an ""art"" theater thirty-eight years ago when I was 15.  I have never forgotten it.  I fell in love with the character John Singer and the actor who played him, Alan Arkin.  He was one of my favorites from that day forward.  His loneliness and compassion came through though no words were spoken from his mouth.  It was in his eyes.  The movie moved me in a way that I can still feel to this day.  It was my awakening to the sad fact that humans do not always take the time to really see into the heart of another. I'm hoping it comes out on DVD soon.",1172361600,9,569,3.982300884955752
287251,5,6300269485,"No, it's not the novel, which is a multi-plotted study of four characters whose lives are symmetrically developed and eventually tied together like the themes in a sonata, all of them linked by their attraction to a deaf-mute as an alternative to a profound sense of futility, despair and, above all, loneliness felt by each of the four.  The ultimate irony is that the only character who affords the others a solace from their alienation is himself the most isolated and miserable character in the story, denied even an illusory companionship when his only friend dies.

The film omits much of the confused and failed political agendas of the black Southern doctor (Dr. Copeland) and the inarticulate Marx idealogist (Jake Blount) as well as the antisocial preoccupations of the novel's unlikely, voyeuristic hero, the restaurant owner, Biff Brannon.  But by focusing on the struggles of the deaf-mute (Alan Arkin) and the idealistic young woman seeking to escape from oppressive social circumstances (Sondra Locke), it accomplishes more than many films.  In fact, I can think of few movies that so effectively represent life in a small-minded, provincial Southern community: a form of American pastoral that is also a microcosm of life--from racial and social prejudice to economic hardship to dreams of personal freedom and achievement to the universality of the loneliness that paradoxically joins and separates the often dysfunctional family of humanity.

This is a film with a lot of heart, one moreover that's capable of gettihg under your  skin and leaving a lasting impression much like McCullers' writing.  Its strengths are more likely to be apparent to someone who sees the movie before reading the novel that inspired it.  Most importantly, despite simplifying, sentimentalizing, and ""sanitizing"" the original novel considerably, this is not the kind of film present-day Hollywood would risk an investment on.  It retains far too many of the themes, realistic portrayals and aesthetic elements of serious, non-escapist literary art to be seen as a viable property for a popular and commercially successful movie, or even as a candidate for a DVD transfer.",1152489600,49,2168,5.260869565217392
287252,4,6300269485,"This is, as promoted, simply a nice story about a really good guy: a deaf mute who helps some people and, in the end, desperately needed someone to help him.

Alan Arkin is memorable as the deaf mute and Sondra Locke, in her first screen role, also shines as the second lead. A pity Locke was never given roles this meaty since then. Percy Rodriguez also is memorable here.

Since this is good storytelling, from a best-selling book by Carson McCullers, all the characters here stand out. It's not a fast-moving film yet it is an involving story in which the viewer winds up caring about these people. Yes, the ending is sad and shocking but, in this case, a good ending because it makes you reflect more on what perhaps you and I neglect to do: to remember that everyone needs encouragement from time to time, even the encouragers.

This movie a throwback to some of the nice films of the 1940s, except that, despite being rated ""G,"" there were several instances ofprofanity in here, including one usage of the Lord's name in vain. Still one for the whole family.",1145577600,4,1064,4.560209424083769
287253,4,6300269485,"This movie is one of those about everyday life and about one's journey through his own life.  One thing that I saw that was significant that all the reviews to date missed with the fact that John Singer had really only one friend whom brought him joy and confort.  This movie builds from Singer's desire to be near his friend, who is mentally challenged, mute and hospital bound.

  In Singer's quest to be with his only friend, his path crosses with others whom he is able to help, one way or another as they deal with their problems; one is a black doctor who hates whites, disapproves of the man his daughter marries and her employment (this movie takes place during the Civil Rights Era), the life of one teenager who is not a girl, not yet a woman, a brief crossing with a man who is drunk but he befriends and finally the lives of the doctor's daughter who becomes enbittered toward her father.  All of these people's find comfort from Singer but are unable to return it, partly because of the communication gap and partly because of their own problems.  The centerpiece in Singer's life that brings him the comfort and satisfaction he needs comes from his friend in the hospital.  While this aspect of the film does not get a great deal  of film time, the lack thereof cannot take away the significance of it in the life of Singer whom which others find comfort in all the while he is living in lonely isolation.

Don't look for a happy ending here, this movie is about life in a real world.  Be it fictional or not, life does not always afford us a happy resolution to everything.... or at least when we would like it to.

One drawback about this movie that may necessitate reading the book is the lack of captions for when Singer was communicating, especially with his friend. Though the significance of the relationships in his life cannot be diminished by not knowing what was being communicated, it may have gave more depth to the role being played out.",1144540800,3,1965,4.504225352112676

If others could only read hearts as well as he reads lips, his internal vacancy could be very easily filled.

287256,5,6300269485,"I'm sorry to say I did not read the book. I am familiar with the work of Carson McCullers, and her narratives are thoroughly character-driven. However, she does center her material on one character (as in ""The Member of the Wedding""). In this case, it's an incredible man named John Singer, masterfully portrayed by the great Alan Arkin. Certainly, most books need to be ""abbreviated"" in their transfer to the screen. (""Tom Jones"" comes to mind, a huge sprawling Henry Fielding novel, concisely brought to the screen). I have read ALL the previous reviews, and pitiably lament that I hadn't read Ms. McCuller's novel. Still, I feel that John Singer's integrity, loneliness and pain, not to mention his frustration, was so brilliantly conveyed by Arkin. Sondra Locke was nominated for an Oscar for this, critics comparing her to Julie Harris in ""Member of the Wedding"". It's an auspicious debut, but it is Cecily Tyson who deserved that nomination. Outstanding performances from Chuck McCann, Percy Rodriguez and Stacy Keach were wonderful and complete; having not read the book, I knew everything I needed to know about these characters, as a viewer. This simple film from 1968 could certainly benefit from a ""re-telling"" as a mini-series or HBO film. Perhaps, the lovers of the book would be sated (and maybe not). Until then, I'm happy to know that this story is captured on film, as well as Arkin's great performance. (Arkin lost the Oscar to Cliff Robertson in ""Charly"", another disabled character).I'm thinking Warner Brothers would do themselves proud to issue a DVD, since Arkin's still around, as well as Locke, Tyson and a few others. I'm also sorry to say that I'm not familiar with the work of director Robert Ellis Miller, but he's made a film that touched me profoundly, with every imaginable portrayal of prejudice and mistrust, all portrayed by ""good, righteous"" people.

The film is about loneliness in all its forms and is sometimes too sentimental and slow.  I understand that the story lines had to be changed in order to fit it all into a screenplay, but the result is an over-simplification of the complex novel. Without the richness of language and depth of characterization of the book, the film is a mere shadow of what I would have liked it to be. But the acting is so good and the theme of prejudice of various kinds against each of the flawed characters is done so well, even winning couple of Academy Award nominations, that it certainly has some things going for it.
