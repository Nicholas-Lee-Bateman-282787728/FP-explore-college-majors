8706411,5,B00UGQ529M,"First off, I liked the movie and when it came out on Blu-ray, I had to get THIS set. It is a 4 disc set, much like that of the same movie in another set with the cards. The set I have now and got initially is black casing, not the standard blue HD casing for Blu-rays shown here.

It's been years since the events of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and Wolverine has been in hiding, a roaming warrior, so to speak. He comes into contact with a Japanese girl one night at a local mountain bar where she finds Logan confronting several ""hunters"" that have shot a bear using arrows with poison. She seeks to bring him to Tokyo, Japan to meet the Japanese soldier whom he saved when the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, August 9, 1945.
Once in Japan, things start to get heated as he becomes involved with a family dispute that turns brutal. Being ""The Wolverine"", however, has it's advantages!
This set has the UNRATED EXTENDED Edition that is excellent! The running time for the movie now is (2:18)
I have to say that the TRAIN SCENE is one of the best shot for a Marvel movie!
