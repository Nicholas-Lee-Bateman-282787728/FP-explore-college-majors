8218948,4,B000VIPXI0,"Never heard of this series....stumbled upon this ZIV produced show in the vein of Highway Patrol with many of the same stock guest stars. Scripts and acting are tight and efficiently good and spot those old Hollywood locations. This show apparently slipped into the public domain which explains why Timeless or Shout hasn't put this out utilizing MGM studio masters. Still, for Alpha, the picture quality is watchable. Great patriotic theme music. Recommended for 50s nostalgia buffs.",1470960000,,484,5.298701298701299
8218949,2,B000VIPXI0,"I unknowingly ordered this product because I thought it was part of the Lockup series that runs on MSNBC. The product description and other information was extremely vague.

I've submitted some photos and information so others don't make the same mistake.",1261094400,14,255,5.219512195121951
