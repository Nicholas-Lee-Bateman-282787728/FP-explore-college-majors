1971922,5,B00015HVLA,"I rented this in VHS format years ago after seeing a trailer for it on a movie I owned. (After seeing the trailer 10 times I finally remembered to look for it at the video store). It wasn't anything like I expected it to be, but I loved it.

In fact, I bought the VHS. It was too expensive to purchase retail (price was close to $100), but I was lucky and found it at a second-hand movie/music store. (bought it for $6.00 Candadian). I have since worn it out and plan to buy the DVD.

The cast obviously had fun making this movie. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of any of the actors in this film.",1097539200,5,611,4.0
1971923,1,B00015HVLA,"Without a doubt, one of the worst films I've ever seen. Horribly bland script. No interesting plot twists. Incredibly stiff acting.

If you are highly entertained by seeing lots of A- and B-list actors walk around reading insipid lines and shooting each other, then this might be for you. But I doubt it.

Roger Ebert (who can hardly be considered a harsh critic) gave this film ZERO stars.

Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.",1095984000,3,421,4.901408450704225
1971924,4,B00015HVLA,"I loved Mad Dog Time, except I had to fast forward through all the scenes with Christopher Jones in.
Apparently he's not done any movies for a long time, and it's just my rotten luck that he chose to appear in this one, momentarily ruining what is an otherwise excellent movie.",1078704000,2,277,4.450980392156863
1971925,1,B00015HVLA,"I have not watched this movie, I fast forward
it until I came across Christopher Jones' part.
I have it stopped on his part and I watch it
once in a while. I do not care for any of the
actors in this movie, except Christopher Jones.
He hasn't been in a movie for several years, and
I wanted to see how he was, and HE STILL HAS IT!",1077148800,,330,3.7971014492753623

1971950,5,B00015HVLA,"we LOVE this movie. Probably watched it 10 times! It has so many subtleties and nuances that aren't evident the first time you watch it! you may also fail to see the humor in many of the jokes/situations the first time around. Definitely watch several times, you'll love it even more!",1426723200,,284,4.588235294117647
1971951,5,B00015HVLA,"This little-known gem of a movie is a real treat.  Until I saw this, ""Goodfellas"" was my favorite goodfella and crime don movie, but this movie may push that movie down to #2.  There is a large, wonderful cast and the movie strikes just the right tone and balance.  I've watched it twice so far and a third viewing is on my schedule.....give it a try.  You'll be surprised at how good it is.",1411862400,2,391,4.243243243243243
1971952,5,B00015HVLA,"This was a quirky,dark comedy that some people don't seem to get, but I thought it was great. I'd seen it years ago, and then last year it came on TV over at my brother's house, so i had him watch it, and he loved it,as well. I thought an uncle of mine would really appreciate it, so I grabbed a copy to show him, and any others that want to see it. The price I got here was too good to pass up",1396742400,,394,3.7023809523809526
1971953,1,B00015HVLA,"i bought this movie because i love Gabriel Byrne, but this is probably one he would like to forget. it's so bad i couldn't even subject anyone else to watch it, and put it in the recyclables.",1388793600,,191,4.1891891891891895

1971955,5,B00015HVLA,Good movie.  It is worth seeing over and again.  Thanks for this fantastic movie.  I would recommend that everyone buy this product.,1337731200,,132,4.909090909090909
1971974,5,B00015HVLA,"The brilliance of this film lies in its director, screen writer, actors, Ellen Barkin, absolutely perfect acting, camera, camera angles, camera distance to actors with perfect lighting and angles, scene lighting, shadows, dialogue pace, scene pace, scene pause, character introduction, character development, character demise, story flow, song selection, did I mention Ellen Barkin, oh and Richard Dreyfuss in as perfect a part as he will ever have brilliantly delivered, Jeff Goldblum in as perfect a part as he will ever have brilliantly delivered and I hope he did this for no fee since his brilliant performance was apparently effortlessly delivered and lastly Larry Bishop (son of Joey) as Nicholas Falco who let Goldblum have the last shot.  Brilliant.  By the way, I really like this film and highly recommend it.  Thank you Larry Bishop from one who loves a good story, directed very well and actors who take direction very well and deliver.",1278979200,2,949,5.189542483660131
1971975,3,B00015HVLA,"If you watch this film expecting to see a kind of remake of the Godfather or Donnie Brasco, forget about it... but if you want a second degree con film this is it!! most of the actors are hilarious and pretending to be somebody else, like a real godfather, you never believe in them for 1 second and you can see how much they enjoy overplaying...",1266105600,,346,4.257575757575758
1971976,1,B00015HVLA,"This is a movie that should have never been made.  A complete failure, e.g., acting, directing, the script (sucks BIG time).

The popular artists (great actors) in this movie should be slapped in the face for participating in such an awful movie.

I would like to know the politics behind this movie, i.e., why was this crap ever approved by the studio?",1246579200,2,353,4.661290322580645
1971977,5,B00015HVLA,"This is a fun film that was released to relative obscurity, but is a hidden gem.  The film centers on the events surrounding a mob boss who is getting out of the looney bin and all of the power plays surrounding him.  Great acting by the entire cast.  The director does an excellent job of building a quirky mob world filled with great characters such as Sleepy Joe and Brass Balls Ben London.  This movie has been released under two titles even here in the states, I have a copy of the vhs under the other title which was Trigger Happy.  Ironically both titles come from the same line in the movie.  This is one of my top picks for those who like mobster movies, funny movies or movies that are just plain fun.  Actors include, Jeff Goldblum in one of his best roles, Richard Dreyfuss and Gabriele Byrn to name a few but it is a large ensemble cast and has many cameos including Angie Everhart, Burt Reynolds, and even Richard Pryor.  Check this one out and enjoy.",1197849600,,965,4.351955307262569

1971979,5,B00015HVLA,"1996's MADS DOG TIME is quirky fun. This little hoodlum black comedy is the stuff cult films are made of.  Unorthodox at best, this film contains a great cast and very interesting characters. The cast truly is fantastic including Richard Dreyfuss, Gabriel Byrne, Jeff Goldblum, Burt Reynolds, Henry Silva, Joey Bishop, Diane Lane, Ellen Barkin, Kyle MacLachlan, Michael J. Pollard, Richard Pryor, Paul Anka, Gregory Hines and the long lost enigmatic Christopher Jones not seen since RYAN'S DAUGHTER. Larry Bishop produced, directed and wrote this wild screenplay. The more you watch it, the more you see. Highly underrated.",1173052800,4,623,5.357142857142857

1971981,5,B00015HVLA,"This is one of the sexiest movies around. The characters are bigger than life. If you like the old Rat Pack movies with Frank, Dean and the gang then you'll love this. The scene with Billy Idol and Jeff Goldblum is hilarious.",1143072000,2,225,4.380952380952381
1971982,4,B00015HVLA,"MDT is a gem. Bizarre and very funny. If you like any of the actors in this film, and you have a taste for the bizarre and dark humor, chances are you'll find a lot to love here. Dreyfuss, Goldblum, MacLachlan, Reynolds, Silva, Byrne are all great. Be the first in your mob to discover this.",1110672000,14,291,4.214285714285714
1971983,5,B00015HVLA,"I happen to like MAD DOG TIME (or TRIGGER HAPPY as I first knew it) very much indeed, but I like a great many strange and flawed films.

It seems to me that the makers of this film are poking fun at both the harmless gangsters of GUYS AND DOLLS and ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS, and at the High Seriousness of THE GODFATHER and its progeny. I know of only one Gangster film that surpasses it in outright weirdness - ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA - and the only one that is more darkly comic is GOODFELLAS, which most people treat as serious drama.

If you ever scoffed at the good hearted gangsters of the '50's  and 60's musicals, or laughed at the pretensiousness of 70's and 80's gangster noir, you may like this film a lot. Or you may hate it. It is a very peculiar vision, and not to all tastes. But don't dismiss it without a look. There will probably never be another film anything like it.",1100476800,5,892,4.174418604651163
