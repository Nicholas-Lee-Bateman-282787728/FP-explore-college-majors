8237185,5,B00105NY7A,"Having visited Acadia National Park in Bar Harbor, ME, on more than one occasion, I was happy to have this DVD which features a great deal of history and information about the park, but even more satisfying is the stunningly beautiful photography and scenery. A first-rate production, narrated by an old pro, Jack Perkins; if you love National Parks and excellent videography, then this is a ""must have""!",1282953600,,404,4.955882352941177
