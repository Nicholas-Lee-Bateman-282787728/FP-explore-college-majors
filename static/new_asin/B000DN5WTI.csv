2475693,5,B000DN5WTI,"What would parents do without Dr. Brazelton?  He makes everything so clear.  He does it again with this video on discipline, which provided helpful guidance for our family.  By the way, this is part of a series to help parents, the I Am Your Child series.  I've seen a few of the other videos and they're also helpful.",1159401600,8,318,4.431034482758621

8102847,5,B000DN5WTI,"I am an early childhood specialist and i give this book to many people who are seeking help in dealing with toddlers and preschoolers.  many of the techniques for interacting with your children as a parent, guardian, nanny, grandparent, other relatives and professionals dealing with ""short people"" will benefit from this book.  Dr. Terry is a most cherished resource for me.",1389657600,,375,5.131147540983607
8102848,5,B000DN5WTI,"wonderful DVD. Use it in my pediatric nursing Growth & Development clalss. Thank you. Price was also great.
Dr. Brazelton is the expert",1387152000,,135,4.913043478260869
8102849,4,B000DN5WTI,"There are a few things I would update, even in content...but for a compassionate view from both child and parent viewpoints, Brazelton delivers a very eloquent overview of teaching children learning and limits.",1377907200,,210,5.393939393939394
8102850,2,B000DN5WTI,"This video is extremely basic and is for parents with very young children.  It does not address discipline past the toddler ages, and what it does talk about seems OK but very basic.  My husband and I completely agree that the basis of discipline (and limits)needs to be love, but feel that sometimes this video did not show the firmness that good parenting can require.  We are blessed with wonderful chidren, 6 and 10, and wanted to grow as better parents but did not find this video very helpful.",1355270400,3,499,4.584269662921348
8102851,2,B000DN5WTI,"I love Dr. Brazelton, his book Touchpoints was wonderful...but i have to say that I am very disappointed by this DVD.  I bought it to help me address some difficult behaviors in my child, and this DVD does not even touch on how to deal with truly difficult behavior.  For example, it demonstrates giving a young child a time-out, and the child on the video sits there for it...the demonstration of what to do when he tries to get up involves the parent gently touching the child's legs as he sits...yeah, right. What about kids that aren't going to just sit there for their time out?  If you are to the point where you are looking for discipline parenting videos, then you will probably agree that you also have a kid who will not sit quietly just because you give him a time out.  I agree with the principles of this video and love Dr. Brazeltons general principles and ideology, but in my case, this didn't even touch on what I was hoping to find, which was solid and specific advice for extremely difficult behaviors such as biting, kicking, hitting, and not sitting for timeouts!",1355097600,2,1083,4.538461538461538
8102852,5,B000DN5WTI,"This video provided specific parenting situations with different ages of young children - and then went on to suggest solutions AND provided a short scene to demonstrate it! Very useful information using non-violent means to deal with some of the behaviors we all hope never happens in a public place; but often does.  I was very impressed with the video, its overall production and the information provided.  This will be used regularly in our parenting program.",1234828800,10,463,5.078947368421052
8102853,5,B000DN5WTI,The DVD came quickly after I ordered it for my Early Childhood class at the local high school. Thanks so much!!,1210291200,,111,4.333333333333333
8102854,3,B000DN5WTI,The information provided is rather basic and is pretty much common sense.  I can't say that I really learned anything new.  The video is pretty short as well... only 30 minutes long.  I suppose it might benefit someone who doesn't do a lot of reading in regards to child development or someone who doesn't have much expereince with children.,1176163200,7,341,4.745762711864407
