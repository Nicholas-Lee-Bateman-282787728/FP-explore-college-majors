He's not even Japanese and not even on Earth, not to mention the sword play was pathetic. I have to wonder how this was ever released in it's current form.

5250788,2,B00930LIT0,"Seem like a interesting show to watch.  Even if it was more going B rate movie.  The story just went bad as far as the driven character.  The story had promised but it missed its mark in the end.  There was lots of dots that really didn't connect well in the story.  It was more like ok hero, skip skip, people follow skip skip, and over.  It was missing a lot of background and frankly wish that if people are going to do a movie at least put effort in building the character and story.  Too mundane and boring.  I spent most of the time messing with my cat.. petting him and having him attack my hand under a blanket.  you know the pick o boo.  something is moving in the blanket and get a kick of watching the curious cat try to attack this unknown object.  That should tell you how interesting the movies was to me.",1356307200,,819,4.120253164556962

5250790,2,B00930LIT0,I rate this film low (2) because it was disconnected at times and the quality was below the standard of action films that I enjoy.  There was a good story line but lost in translation to me through the film.  But more sadly was its predicability.

5250792,1,B00930LIT0,"I have no idea why some very talented actors chose to do this film. This movie has a strong resemblance to the Dune series, but butchered, with very little originality. Given the premise, there was potential in the film, a planet mined to the brink of extinction by invading humans then left to rot. The indigenous people, basically outcasts, move about in nomadic tribes, while the humans live in relatively primitive cities governed by a warlord who wants dominion over the whole planet. Also, the mining process has made most of the inhabitants sterile. So a good writer could take these elements and put a good story together... Well it didn't happen here. Take some key elements from Dune, sprinkle in some Japanese culture, a little social issues, and you have Hirokin.",1354665600,,775,4.878787878787879
5250793,4,B00930LIT0,"This film had a small budget, but looks absolutely nothing like a low-budget movie. It was really ambitious to try and create an indie-epic sci-fi adventure movie set on another planet. Most indie-films take place in an apartment over a few days and involve very little action or special effects at all. Hirokin sort of breaks all those rules.

Some of the actors aren't the best and the story isn't groundbreaking, but that's not unusual for indie movies especially when there are hundreds of movies with an entire cast of terrible actors (Hirokin had Wes Bentley as the lead) much worse than in Hirokin. It even has some surprising side-characters. The two stoner-buddy smugglers are extremely funny.

[...]- This article sheds a lot of light on what it's actually like to make an indie-film.",1348444800,2,794,4.917910447761194
5250794,3,B00930LIT0,"On a distant planet the human overlords are slowly wiping out the indigenous species known as Arids in order to take the planet's raw materials. If it sounds like ""Avatar"", wait. Griffin (Julian Sands) is the evil human viceroy over the planet which he runs like the Roman Empire.

Moss (Angus Macfadyen )is a rebel that Griffin is hunting and wants to kill. Through a series of events a human named Hirokin (Wes Bentley) winds up in Moss' s camp. Moss knows the old ""Way"" which is like an oriental earth religion, plus martial arts. He instructs Hirokin in ""The Way"" so he can unite the tribes and defeat the humans. ""The Way"" also allows one to see the outcome of their decision before it happens.

The humans have great advances like hover crafts, but fight with swords and spears. It is difficult to tell humans from Arids except by the lines on their hands. They can interbreed, but unfortunately the genocide has caused most of the Arid women to become barren.

To add to the mix there are some woman/breeding/jealousy issues between Griffin, Hirokin, Griffin's barren girlfriend Orange(Jessica Szohr) Hirokin's fertile wife Terra (Mercedes Manning) and Moss's daughter Maren (Laura Ramsey).

The acting and dialogue was fairly bad. They could have interjected some humor from time to time...like ""These 2 Arids walk into a bar for the first time and say, ""I'll have the usual...""

No f-bombs, sex, nudity. Rape? Woman showers with her clothes on. PG sex talk ""submit""",1346198400,7,1474,4.856573705179283

I really enjoyed the story of someone who started off as a 22 year old hungry for money in NYC and then becoming the top in wealthy world. Although sad he did it illegally since he was defiantly smart enough to do it legally and still become rich, it was very exciting to watch.

5250819,5,B00930LIT0,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a great movie, and it is all about excess, just like our new US president. It is perfect if you are single and living life to the limit. Alternatively, it is a train wreck of misbehavior if you have matured beyond that. It confirms what could go wrong if you go down the wrong path. It seems that the answer depends on your age and desires. If you are single, (or love the single life even while married), are in the 25-35 age range,(or wish you still were without responsibilities) then you will love this movie. It will be nostalgic for crazy times in your past before the Lehman Brothers fiasco.

How can you not enjoy it from that point of view? It is all about tremendous everything where ""too much of everything money can buy"" is still never enough. This is the target market. Director Martin Scorsese, does an amazing job of taking us back to the life and times of bucket shop ""boiler rooms"" where the phone line is the con man's way to gold. I cannot think of a more hedonistic life on any movie screen since seeing ""Caligula"" many years ago.

Having a threesome or foursome is nothing to the main character Jordan Belfort, (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) why not go for a 100 some! I have never considered it possible to have a sex orgy on a commercial airplane with 250+ people. I now have seen it on screen and think differently. Throwing midgets for sport, stripper performances in the office all change your perspective on what is normal. What can happen in the office bathroom has also changed for me, perhaps permanently.

It is a kind of visual orgy, New Roman style, but set in Long Island, New York. That is the only kind of description that could work for this movie. You may think this is a really positive thing, or you may not, but it does seem to be a kind of benchmark. For good or bad, that is the attitude on screen, and it can be amazing to watch. Or not watch in the case of Dubai, where almost 45 minutes of the 3 hour movie were cut in the local version. That is a lot of film, a pretty major slimmed down version.

Why do you watch and why can you enjoy such a movie basking in excess? You come away with different reasons. It represents a fantasy of what could happen if the financial ""perfect storm"" takes place during your career. The big money comes in and you have to find ways to spend it. The trouble is, it all ends badly, very badly, with many involved all part of the collateral damage, some end up dead.

Best moments? worse moments? Too many to really count although seeing a person take so many drugs that they cannot speak on the phone and be understood was certainly memorable. Not being able to stand up or have motor skills, and being forced to crawl down stairs was another. Driving a Lamborghini Countach in such a state or even opening the door was notable.

The Top 3 Takeaways from this book that really impact any reader are:

1) There is a lot to learn about the many levels of finance within Wall Street. There is no single way to success, so be aware of every player in the financial game, bottom feeders do thrive.

2) The best rainmakers know how to make money and keep doing what they do best by maintaining their confidence. When this comes from drugs though, the end comes sooner than expected.

3) When becoming a successful rainmaker, your emotional strength from close friends or family at home, may help you perform at work. Every person has a personal life, so the more empty or fulfilling it is, the more you can succeed.

Sinking a yacht near Italy in a major storm, and seeing the rescue plane sent blow up as a sign from god or some other warning to wake up and change, all come to mind as key scenes. Stratton Oakmont, the chop shop firm in question, will be a very tough act to follow on screen or anywhere else. Perfect for your holiday weekend with a new US president who is all about excess! It is all realistic, and portrayed wonderfully by an excellent cast. An amazing movie that is perfect for the holidays, highly recommended!

Leo DiCaprio deserved an Oscar for his work in this film because he is magnificent playing a depraved yet colorful character. The scenes and the experiences are wild yet just about every event portrayed actually happened which makes this movie all the more engrossing. I know that though the character he plays is reckless and entertaining, he brought a lot of pain tonpeople who lost everything by being associated in some way with him.

5251046,5,B00930LIT0,"One of Martin Scorseses best ever! The heightened, ravenous, and perverted look at corporate crime, most resembling Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995) via first person narrative and unusual personalities  yet the gangsters are tame compared to Leonardo DiCaprios manic Jordan Belfrot. Joe Pescis bloody violence vs. Jonah Hills obscene behavior there is a reason why Belforts book reads like a Scorsese film because there is no mountain too tall or dangerous that the Strattonites(nickname for employees) won't be rattled by. Despite the lack of violent murders, The Wolf of Wall Street fits the criteria of a typical gangster film as a group of men remain hell-bent on breaking the law in the roller-coster-like grand rise to power and ultimate demise to prison. Although set in the late 80s and early 90s, its obvious that the film is to be implied commentary on the current economic status and the 2008 stock market crash. While we assume brokers weren't consistently partying on yachts or tag-teaming hookers in side offices, the bombardment of a never-ending J.Gatsby party and illegal maneuvers ring all to similar to what the 99% have continually accused of the 1% since the beginning. While some  panned The Wolf of Wall Street as pornography for the jaded and discontent with the economic system  this conflict over Scorseses latest makes it highly culturally relevant  because truthfully don't we all admire Jordan Belfort on some level? You can be shocked, applaud, and spiteful towards his actions  but at the end of the day,who can sell the pen?",1514419200,,1559,5.098039215686274

  Overall, it was an interesting movie. The movie did a good job explaining the scams and mind of DiCaprio's character. There is also a nice reference made by one of the characters about the movie ""Boiler Room"".

5251089,5,B00930LIT0,"Jonah Hill is the strange secret weapon of this film.  WOWS got a lot of attention by the academy of arts and science in 2014 for its epic quality drama and the larger than life adaptation of a real Wall Street con-artist and his conspicuous consumption based on a true story.  Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful at bringing real characters to life on the big screen.  In The Aviator, he became Howard Hughes.  In Catch Me if You Can, he became Frank Abagnale.  In TWOW, he becomes real time criminal, Jordan Belfort.  There is this one scene that stands out to me: he is on his yacht off the coast of France and he tells his best friend and drug dealer, Jonah Hill, that he cannot and will not die while being sober.  They are stuck in what appears to be a deadly squall.  Jonah Hill goes to get him his drugs...and suddenly everything is okay again.  Director Martin Scorsese seamlessly blends the danger and depravity of Jordan Belfort's life with his own unique vision of how an American criminal gets from his auspicious beginnings through to the inevitable finish line: prison.",1510531200,6,1079,4.607329842931938

5251177,5,B00930LIT0,"When I was contemplating buying this, I was immensely irritated by the reviews. I read several reviews from several star ratings and I just got more and more ticked. I don't give a damn how you feel about the movie, I'm more worried about the product, how to download it, what I can download it to. Is it wifi/data dependant or is it or is it fully loaded onto the device? So this review will be mostly product review and a brief movie review.

PRODUCT REVIEW:
Last time I tried to download a movie it went awful. I'm still a little traumatized. If you want this movie in multiple forms I recommend this format. You get the physical DVD and a code to download it onto your devices (I did it on my phone). I'm not sure how it works on Android devices but I know the Apple process. You get the code inside, go to iTunes, go the redeem feature, and you can take a picture or type in the code and it'll automatically download. It's super simple. I was dreading the potential process of obtaining a digital version. I thought I'd have to go to a website or burn it onto my computer and transfer files onto my phone but luckily it's a much simpler process. Scan and download. That's the first round of downloading. If you go to your TV app library, the movie will be displayed. However, the movie starts out in your ""cloud."" So it's wifi/data dependant. You can tap on the little cloud button to start the second round of downloading. That means it will actual BE on your phone (it will take up a little phone space though). I didn't actually touch the DVD for months after getting it but I tried it out and it's a working CD. So that's great too.

MOVIE REVIEW:
I've seen this movie before on Hulu but they removed it. Netflix and HBO didn't have it either. So I decided to get a physical and digital form of it so no one can take it away from me ever again. This is easily my favorite movie. A lot of this has to do with my unbridled love for Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, and Jonah Hill. I know that Jordan Belfort is a real person and that he's trash but this movie is HILARIOUS. And this is coming from someone that doesn't condone or indulge in debauchery.

This movie is nothing but filth and vulgarity, so if you're (hyper)sensitive to that kind of exposure, avoid this movie.
But Leonardo DiCaprio is in it, so watch it anyways.",1502236800,,2335,4.314350797266515

5251192,2,B00930LIT0,"This film does indeed glorify greed, dishonesty, debauchery, drug and alcohol abuse, and all sorts of other bad behavior.  It's no morality play, that's for certain.  In the end the ""hero"" (who should be the villain) rides off into the sunset virtually untouched by justice or Karma.  I know this is based on a real-life story, but it doesn't have to promote the guy as a hero.  After watching this, one might imagine that a person can do copious amounts of drugs and alcohol with no side-effects or after-effects at all.  If the lead actor had not denied that this film glorified bad behavior, I would not have written this.  But somebody needs to say it.  If you or I behaved like the Main Character, we'd be in prison or dead.

5251408,3,B00930LIT0,"I am comparing the two films for good reason. Both films are inspired and based on the same real life stock swindler, Jordan Belfort. I am not going to keep anyone on the edge of their seat as the Boiler Room comes out on top in my opinion.

The Wolf of Wall Street takes an autobiographical approach in telling the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort during the golden age of Wall St. The movie is set during the stock market crash of 1987 where we see a young and ambitious Jordan Belfort lose his job at a big firm. His confidence and ambitiousness enables him to brush this temporary setback off only to redeem himself at a smaller firm in Long Island. Immediately, his new fellow colleagues are blown away by his fiery sales pitches and quick wits. He is unstoppable and clearly talented. Cruising in his Testarossa Ferrari while receiving oral sex from his 2nd wife, Jordan Belfort is established as a man who values money over anything in life. For three hours, we observe his ""whatever it takes"" mentality which drives him to financial success and ultimately his downfall.

Is the acting great? Yes absolutely.  Is it entertaining? Yes, Somewhat. But in all honesty, how long can you watch an egotistical drug addict blow cocaine off of hookers rear ends and smoke crack? Well, not for 2 1/2 hours. I know I couldn't. The film focuses more on Jordan Belforts lavish lifestyle which is to say is uncouth, irresponsible, and just downright reckless; Hot cars, hot yachts, hot women, hot Swiss banks accounts are all at Jordan's disposal to impress. But the problem with the film lies in its failure to establish any sort of real connection with its audience. Did I really care about Jordan Belfort ? Did I care about his 1st or 2nd wife? Did I care about his friends or anyone in the film? I cant say I did. It was very boring. Even the young FBI Agent tailing Jordan was wooden and hollow to say the very least. But I understand the message though: A man with no moral compass but with a lot of cash can really do some damage.

The Boiler Room on the other hand is far more interesting and entertaining because it engages its audience on a more effective and localized level. The Boiler room gives us a closer insight into the actual scheme that Jordan Belfort was running. It also gives us a close look into the boiler rooms operation and how it affects the lives of hard working innocent people. We are walked through the recruitment process as young money hungry men are thrown into the lions den to pitch stock that doesnt exist.  They are motivated and pushed by a highly entertaining Ben Affleck to pitch stock as if it was their only purpose worth serving. We are also shown how the money is illegally swindled and distributed all while appearing to comply with SEC regulations. We are invited into the protagonists home, Seth, and from here we observe the estranged relationship he has with this father. His father, who is a high profile and honorable judge only wants to see his son succeed by making an honest living. I sympathized with the protagonist and the rest of his family as they are dragged into the sons debacle via a tapped phone conversation by the FBI. And then we have the real victim on the other side, Harry. Harry is a hard working man saving money to put a down payment on a house to support his wife and children. Seth preys on his insecurities that ultimately drain Harrys entire life savings into a bottomless pit of the next big stock. 
We are given a better understanding of how this criminal operation personally affects the lives from people inside and outside the operation.
Are there drugs involved? Yes, but kept to a minimum. Is there a lavish lifestyle portrayed? Yes, but also kept to a bare minimum. The lifestyle is not important. Whats important are the lives that are affected and how we sympathize with them.",1487894400,,3857,4.57452966714906

5251453,2,B00930LIT0,"Like any film by Scorcese, the production values of of The Wolf of Wall Street are first rate.  It is cohesive and tells a story in a compelling way.  The visual presentation is far above average, stylish even.  With that said, what I don't particularly care for is Leo DiCrapio's sanctimonious posturing as some some sort of high flown ambassador of Mother Nature, while remaining, at least by all appearances, utterly oblivious to the many real, demonstrable, concrete, pressing problems and horrors continually bearing down on suffering humanity. And this, while he lives the jets-setting life of a pampered, slut-hunting Hollywood cad.  The hypocrisy and self-righteousness which emanates from Mr. DiCrapio and his cohorts rarely fails to impress, however, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is particularly objectionable in this regard, as it presents ""Jordan Belfort"" in a much more magnanimous light than the actual reality would warrant. Belfort is gallingly portrayed by Scorcese and DiCrapio as a kind of bad boy frontiersman of a wild and woolly Wall Street who, by sheer pluck and talent, takes the stock exchange bull heroically by the horns and carves out a formidable empire of his own, thereby attaining the fabled fast life of abundance and wanton pleasure -- the supposed dream of every regular working stiff with a ""ugly wife"" who ""takes the train to work everyday"" -- on his own terms. This is an evil, unscrupulous person, who illegally battened on the earnings of others, who enabled financial treachery of unheard of proportions, who basically lived to screw hookers and take drugs on his million dollar yacht. This is a person who would be vilified as a monster in any sane society, but in DiCrapio's upside down world of frivolous activism, fast money and even faster women, he is instead an ""anti-hero"" whose exploits are to immortalized in the most glamorous exhibition of pornographic filth and excess that the cinematic censors will allow. DiCrapio is little more than a modern decadent and a hypocrite. He and his ilk will go down in history as the worst kind of human being.",1486252800,,2096,5.014367816091954

5251621,4,B00930LIT0,"An interesting movie, kind of the Wall Street (the place, not the movie) version of Scorcese's Casino.  In retrospect I'm faintly surprised that Leo didn't win the Oscar for this, because he certainly threw everything into the role (ironically he lost to Matthew McConaughey, who has a notable cameo/supporting role early in this movie).  He was riveting most of the time, ably supported by his movie father Rob Reiner, and Margot Robbie, who does more with the trophy wife role than it deserved.  The story moved, and seemed just true enough to make sense (many of the people portrayed take issue with how the movie showed them).

Issues?  Well the F-word is used a bit much.  It's like they were trying to set the record for total uses of it that they set, but consciously.  It's the movie version of Deadwood, the use of it (and it's a word I use a fair amount in real life, so I'm no prude) gets distracting at times.  The other is Jonah Hill, and I don't blame the actor, but the character he was  given.  I just can't find it in me to believe that such an uncouth, out of control buffoon could be that successful at much of anything.  I mean Hill didn't help, going over the top every chance he got, but it's clearly what Scorcese, for reasons passing understanding, wanted.

The Wolf of Wall Street got a lot of attention, rightly so, because it's a good movie.  It got a lot of awards nominations, because it was made by Martin Scorcese, and anything he releases now does.  The film is worth your time, and probably your coin.  It's very, very rated R, and so long as you're fine with that, you'll like this movie.",1479340800,,1622,4.469387755102041

Ten minutes into the movie, I scratch my head think everything about this movie is so familiar -- the voice over, the characters, the story. Then I realized it was almost exactly like one of my all time favorite movies ""Goodfellas."" Sure enough it was directed by Martin Scorsese. His mark is all over the film. So if you loved Goodfellas, you'll at least like The Wolf of Walll Street. Leonardo Di Caprio was good as the crooked trader but a young Ray Liotta would have been even better.",1479168000,,591,4.5327102803738315

5251627,1,B00930LIT0,"No, I'm not a ""verified purchase"" because it would be beyond any level of decency to spent money on this despicable movie. It has been given four stars--by whom? There is no better example of the depths to which our culture has sunk to produce what is basically filled with filth. Wall Street was a movie providing an insight into the corruptness that can lure people into the depths of greed and depravity. So was Boiler Room. But these did so without the orgies, without resorting to see how far they could push the depravity that moviegoers now come to expect, and even praise. The best part was when DiCaprio's character had a ""less than friendly"" meeting with FBI agents on his over the top yacht. It was great to watch him finally squirm.

Just what is wrong with the movie rating system? And, one might add, our society as well. The movie is trash, pure and simple. I watched it only so that I wouldn't be accused of writing a review without having seen it to the end. Shame on everyone involved in this poor excuse of a production. The story could have been told without a full depiction of the depravity involved. Sadly, it also shows the disintegration of good taste and movies that can tell what would have been an interesting story without descending into the cesspool that Hollywood has become. I am running out of adjectives to further describe this. And no, I'm not some religious crusader. At my age I can recognize pure crap when I see it, and that is exactly what this waste of time and effort is--trash that should never have seen the light of day.",1478908800,,1567,4.517605633802817

Seriously though if I hadn't already known stockbrokers and, had I not lived in their home and worked for one prominent family, I would think stockbrokers were terrible people. My beef with this movie, is that the very portrayal of the stockbroker per say, in general, is completely inaccurate. Yes, they are mostly high strung, and can be edgy, very edgy, however, many work themselves to the bone, getting up at the crack of dawn to ride a train into Manhattan then work like dogs, then ride the train home to their families whom they love and adore. Think, Sheena Easton's, ""My baby takes the mornin train, he works from 9-5...""

This other stuff, the hedonistic, debauchery, the total disregard for decency, that ain't them. Plus, any investor had better do their own homework before handing some guy at an investment firm money.

I was so digusted and actually insulted by the gross negligence of authenticity of the very portrayal of the ""stockbroker"", that I didn't get past the first ten minutes. It was unbelievably disgusting, crass and highly profane.
And I GET that the movie is about a crook. I get that. If you want to say some percentage of brokers are crooks, louts and cheat on their wives, and do drugs, sure. Most, are NOT. Not even close. That is a fact. I know it to be true. To me, it felt morally bankrupt that money was spent on such a hedonistic film.

Now I can see the actors feeling insulted by my words, but think about it, when there are SO many ways to tell a story, and SO many stories to be told. I dunno. Why not focus the movie on the stories of all the people this dopey jerk-off swindled from, eh?-Make a movie about them and their hard earned savings. Put THEM in the spotlight. Maybe share a percentage of profits with all the people he swindled. Just a thought.",1467936000,,1936,4.494318181818182

Leonardo is usually an excellent actor, but this was just too cartoonish. I got sick of the constant filthy language and the reveling in debauchery.

I thought it might be a lesson about the excessive lifestyle of traders.  Well, maybe. I thought it might be about the legal pursuit of this Wall Street huckster.  Hardly.

It's basically THREE HOURS of grown men acting like frat boys who never grow up.  Drugs, sex, more drugs, more sex. The F-bomb thousands of times. As a noun, as a verb as an adjective.  Every form of the word you can think of. I had this in my movie queue for several months, suspecting it might be a dud, but I love Leonard DiCaprio.  I had a three hour plane ride, so I decided to download it and give it a chance. It wasn't worth watching. Save your three hours.

What's concerning is that banks today are issuing the equivalent of CDOs, just with different names.

Scorsese told Charlie Rose the movie was so long because it took him that long to tell the story. And quite a story it is. If the viewer doesn't mind spending 3 hours with people who make one's skin crawl, this is one for the ages.",1464134400,2,764,4.576642335766423

It is a raunchy flick, filled with sex, implied sex, foul language, drugs and oh so much more!  It is not a movie for those people offended by anything mentioned here although it does have it's humorous moments.  For me it was enlightening to see the inception of a Wall Street firm from an abandoned repair garage to a corporation spilling over an entire office building!

I imagine that ""Wolf"" could have cut some scenes here and there, and turned the film into an ""under 120 minute flick"".  By the time it ended, my wife and I breathed a sigh of relief, able to get to bed.  Just when I thought it was about to end, I got ""But wait!  There's more!"".
If I had seen this in the theater, there would have been a need by me to pickup extra snacks (no drinks).

DeCaprio gives a great performance of Jordan Belfort, the true ""wolf of Wall Street"".  If you want to enjoy this flick, I suggest you start it early in the afternoon/evening and not late at night.  You'll thank me later!",1463529600,,1187,4.423963133640553

While George Jung ends up broke, incarcerated, divorced, friendless, and without love from his daughter, it's somewhat downplayed in the wolf of Wall Street (though Jordan does end up mostly broke, divorced, and without the love of his daughter). I think it's that the wolf of wallstreet really insulates you from the people Jordan Belfort and his company screwed over. You only get to see the happy money making business side to it. Anyway it's not a morality play but definitely a wild ride of over the top debauchery in the 80s. Also careful with those Lemmons, they take a while to kick in...",1462147200,,693,4.688524590163935

Money corrupts is what I would term as a moral lesson from the movie.  The writer and director didn't need to inflict any interpretations here.  I have and many other American citizens have our own interpretation of wall street and the elite politicians of the period.

5253824,4,B00930LIT0,"I didn't realize it was a three hour movie when I began watching it, but it moved so quickly that the time flew. Love Leo DiCaprio - he makes the unbelievable - believable.  There are a LOT of F bombs and other vulgarities in this movie so it is not for kids' ears.

Enjoy !!!",1457827200,,276,4.0

8534916,4,B00930LIT0,"Leonardo DiCaprio's hilarious facial expressions in this movie are unparalleled. The main character is a completely unlikable person, but DiCaprio's acting is so good that it makes this a fun and interesting movie, regardless of the fact that I probably would probably really enjoy watching someone punch Jordan Belfort in the face in real life. I'm taking away one star because of that ridiculously ableist ""cerebral palsy phase"" scene. That scene with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill could have been hilarious if they hadn't made it into a joke at the expense of physically and/or intellectually disabled people. They could have easily been made without the blatantly ableist comparison. I understand that this movie could not have been made true to the character that it's depicting without the level of misogyny that was present throughout the entire movie, because the main character is clearly not supposed to be someone anyone would sympathize with. But throwing disabled people under the bus was not necessary to the plot or the character development at all. That was just an example of cheap, exploitative humor with violent undertones that has very bad consequences in the real world.",1530403200,,1195,5.196891191709844
