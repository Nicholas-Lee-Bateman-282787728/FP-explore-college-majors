8011803,5,B0001FUK5E,I got and hand written personal thank you from the owner of funcitybooks.  Now that's customer service!  If your a die hard bowling fan and think bowling is more important than football this video is for you. There was not much focus on Mike Aulby one of the greatest hall of famers of all time but I think this video might of came out before his star was rising on the PBA tour. Don't get me wrong I like all the pros.  If your into bowling history then buy it.  Anyone reading this lets keep bowling alive.  Get your friends and family together and join a league and have fun maybe become a pro someday.,1506211200,,605,4.226086956521739
