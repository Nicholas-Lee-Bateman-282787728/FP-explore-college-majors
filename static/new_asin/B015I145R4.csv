Surprisingly not terrible. Pretty enjoyable movie with plenty of twists. Also had a suspicious amount of parallels to Star Wars.",1468800000,,166,5.384615384615385

The picture quality is good also for such an old movie. I bought it on a blind buy. I saw the trailer for it a few month's before this blu ray's release last year and it was even better than the trailer.",1456704000,,338,3.9130434782608696
8733697,4,B015I145R4,"BOTTOM LINE: If you love the 80's and are a fan of either or both of these films then this Blu-ray is a must-own. I enjoyed DUNGEONMASTER and am a big, big fan of the comicbook-ish ELIMINATORS, so this was a great buy for me. 5 STARS

THE DUNGEONMASTER: An agent of Satan captures an idealistic computer programmer and his young fiance. The man must successfully survive seven challenges set forth by the  demon or he & his girlfriend will lose their eternal souls.

ELIMINATORS: A half-man/half-machine called the Mandroid, haunted by snippets of his fragmented past, escapes imprisonment from a secluded compound and sets out to discover who he was & why he was created, and destroy the demented genius who built him. Along the way the Mandroid's mission brings him into contact with a beautiful scientist, a river rat mercenary, and a mysterious ninja. Together, these individuals are... Eliminators.

THOUGHTS: A long-time fan of ELIMINATORS, it was great to see it being offered on Blu-ray even though I had only just recently picked it up on DVD as part of a single-sided one disc 4-film collection, also from Shout! Factory.  I had heard of of but never seen THE DUNGEONMASTER (original film title RAGEWAR). DM is an okay film, but no where near as much silly fun as ELIMINATORS. DM looks to have been cobbled together from the conceptual ideas for several other unmade films and turned into a semi-connected piecemeal offering. It's a passable time-waster, but the full frontal nude scene in the beginning definitely scratches if off the family viewing list. LOL. The guys behind ELIMINATORS were Danny Bilson & Paul De Meo. They also whipped up ZONE TROOPERS and TRANCERS among others, as well as the first TV incarnation of DC Comics' THE FLASH, so it's no fluke that ELIMINATORS has a pulpy, zippity-pow comic book feel to it. Fun stuff.

THE BLU-RAY: The double feature from Shout! Factory arrives encoded on one single-sided Blu-ray disc. Both films have good transfers, though ELIMINATORS looks a tad sharper. Some dirt & debris can be found throughout both films but is minimal and in no way affects the viewing of either feature. Soundmix is even & level on both. Bonus features are thin; an interview with Peter Manoogian, who directed both films, and the theatrical trailer for each.",1451520000,2,2301,4.872122762148337
