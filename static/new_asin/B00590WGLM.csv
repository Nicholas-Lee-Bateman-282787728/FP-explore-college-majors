4620071,1,B00590WGLM,The movie did not live up to my expectations. Not much action or thrills. Wasted our time watching this one. Not one good thing to say.,1377302400,2,135,4.230769230769231
4620072,1,B00590WGLM,"This is a low budget vamp flick and it shows. Most of the acting is more horrible than the vampires. I paused watching, then finished because I'd already invested an hour...big mistake.",1481500800,,185,4.8125
4620073,1,B00590WGLM,"I love westerns. However, I tried watching for the first 20 minutes and turned it off.  The acting was lacking in delivery.  Really wanted it to be a different western, but it was not meant to be.",1479168000,,196,4.27027027027027
4620074,5,B00590WGLM,Not a bad movie.  I love vampire movies and I wasn't all to disappointed with this one.,1479168000,,87,4.117647058823529

4620077,1,B00590WGLM,Nah,1477526400,,3,3.0
4620078,3,B00590WGLM,"The best thing about this movie was Angelica Celaya. (I hope she gets some really good roles.)

Most of the acting was ""adequate"", some even believable.  But then some was not so good.

Somewhere along the line things changed from being a good western-style movie to being a soap opera ""quality"" creepshow - I think it was about the time that the action changed from the town and the stage to the old mine.  Things just rather deteriorated from there.

I can't say I didn't like it, but then I honestly can't say I liked it, either.  Ms. Celaya is the reason this movie got 3 stars instead of 2.",1467072000,,595,4.363636363636363
4620079,2,B00590WGLM,not so great,1466985600,,12,3.3333333333333335
4620080,2,B00590WGLM,"So, first let me say that I spend many years as an actor/stuntman at Old Tucson and felt a certain kinship with Jasen's character (even down to his friendship with Gil - who actually IS a friend of mine).

Beyond that, the only somewhat redeeming thing about this movie, was that it was predominately filmed at Old Tucson.
The Plot is disjointed, and the relationships are forced in some ways, and incomplete in others.

But then again, this is a classic ""B"" horror flik, so if that's what they were going for.. then they succeeded masterfully.",1466812800,,544,4.65625
4620081,1,B00590WGLM,This movie was one of the biggest waste of time ever.,1466467200,,53,3.909090909090909

4620093,3,B00590WGLM,"The story was slow and action was a bit hokey. I liked the lead character most of the time just for his forced acting, others weren't very memorable.",1458259200,,149,4.357142857142857
4620094,5,B00590WGLM,This was a very good movie and I enjoyed it a lot. Story line was great and had a lot of action.,1458000000,,96,3.409090909090909

4620099,1,B00590WGLM,"Bad movie.  They had a good idea, but it ended there.  Acting was just under mediocre.  I'm surprised I made it through the whole thing.",1456531200,,136,4.36

4620104,5,B00590WGLM,"Loved it!  Then again, I usually enjoy the smaller budget films that don't rely on special effects.  The acting was good, the story line was good, and it was creatively original, (unlike anything coming out of big money Hollywood these days).",1455408000,2,242,4.878048780487805

4620107,3,B00590WGLM,"Can't say much more than this was interesting. The actors did a good job, and the story wasn't horrible, though it was told in an odd manner.

A combination of flashbacks, older flashbacks, and what I assume was a current interview",1454025600,4,231,4.634146341463414
4620108,1,B00590WGLM,Very Choppy! Storyline didn't make much sense.,1453680000,,46,5.714285714285714

8462628,1,B00590WGLM,"Watched this on Prime video. This film is not fun bad, just bad. I think it suffers  from being written , directed , co-produced and co-edited by one person. The vision may have been so clear in his head but seemed disconnected and confusing to the viewer. Performances were mostly wooden and amateur.

Using the Old Tucson studio was a nice touch.",1510444800,,348,4.596774193548387

8462636,1,B00590WGLM,"Huge mistake in wasting time watching this movie.
Badly scripted with cliche story lines is just the beginning. Awful effects, miserable acting and so-so camera work round up the rest. I think that's below a B list movie.
No recommendations whatsoever for this!",1483574400,,261,5.093023255813954
