8003769,5,B0000VBZV2,"Ken Davis is a miracle-worker; he is able to mesmerize and reduce to puddles of laughter, an audience ranging in age from young adolescents to quite elderly, myself among them. He does this by taking the story of Moses' call by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, as written in the Bible, and turning it into a hysterically funny bit.

As funny as Davis is, the message, that any ordinary person can be called by God to do extraordinary things, is not lost and in fact is revisted throughout the video. Davis doesn't sacrifice Biblical truths for cheap laughs. He pulls together a fine performance you just know is led by the Holy Spirit. Get this for yourself, your kids, your unbelieving friends or family. It's a hoot. But it's also a lesson well learned.",1140134400,,775,4.656934306569343
