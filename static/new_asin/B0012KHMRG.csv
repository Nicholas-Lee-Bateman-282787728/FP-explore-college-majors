8246432,5,B0012KHMRG,"The quartet kicks off with a true L & H Classic, Oliver The 8th, a beautifully written and executed piece, with some of the funniest duialogue ever found in motion pictures. The boys, struggling but stable as ""Tonsorial"" artists(aka chin scrapers).  This one has th added dimension of horror, with Mae Busch and otherworldly butler in a old mansion, in itself enough to give one the heeby-jeebies. In this Reviewer's opinion, this short ranks with The Music Box, Helpmates, and The Chimp. *****

Busy Bodies feaures Laurel and Hardy employed at a lumber mill. Predictably, they find a multitude of ways to work *against* the setting. Charles Hall is on hand for a funny tete a tete; there are some very clever sight gags and effects but the pace is slow and the violence factor is up a few notches too high. *** 1/2*

Their First Mistake has all the qualities of the best ""drawing room"" comedies of the time, with some scenes brilliantly realized, with the Boys in a classic ""role reversal"" scenario, as Ollie actually takes Stan's advice and adopts a baby. The proceedings are too funny to give away. Just cue this one up...and enjoy!
Unfortunately, the final 5 minutes or so is very draggy and somewhat perverse. **** 1/2*

Dirty Work is a truly bizarre work, taking place in one place - a Mad Scientists' home. Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps - about 7 training sessions shy of competency. More over the top violence and light horror but here we have the premiere of the rare Hardy line, ""I have nothing to say"", an interesting evolution for the character, when encountering Laurel daffiness. ***

Acceptable video quality.",1315008000,,1628,4.75886524822695
8246433,4,B0012KHMRG,"""Oliver the Eighth"" is a genuinely funny film. Ollie answers a personal ad, thinking he's about to land a sugar-momma. In reality, he's setting himself and Stanley up to get wiped out by a female serial killer.

""Their First Mistake"" must have been their response to all the gay jokes aimed in their direction. Ollie's marriage is on the rocks because he spends more time with Stanley than with his wife. Stan and Ollie casually discuss the problem while laying on Stan's bed and continuously rolling over and assuming one suggestive position after another. Stan suggests Ollie should adopt a baby in order to keep the peace in his home. Ollie goes along with the idea and they go back to Ollie's place with a newly-adopted infant only to find that Mrs. Hardy has left and filed for divorce. Stan and Ollie decide to raise the baby on their own. Considering that homosexuality and having children out of wedlock was extremely taboo when this film was made (1931-32), it's pretty risque for it's time. I would buy this DVD simply for this film alone. Definitely one of the funniest shorts in the series!

I don't know much about the other two short films on this DVD. I remember seeing them years ago, but I can't recall the plotlines.",1268611200,,1234,4.655963302752293
