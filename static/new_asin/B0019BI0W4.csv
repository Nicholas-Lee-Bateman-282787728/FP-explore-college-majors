3431087,5,B0019BI0W4,"A Haunting is a documentary series that explores allegedly true tales of hauntings, ghosts and the supernatural.  Each show is composed of high quality, atmospheric reenactments following the descriptions of eyewitnesses.  Superimposed on the action is the creepy, measured voice of a narrator who sets the mood and explains the events.  The show is exceptionally effective.  Most episodes have at least some unnerving moments and some are downright scary.

Season 4 of A Haunting should continue to appeal to fans. While many of the episodes in Season 4 are interesting, most are not as scary as those from previous seasons.  In fact, some episodes can only be described as odd (e.g., Spellbound) and do not focus on a specific haunting. Some shows are excellent and dedicated viewers will still find plenty to enjoy.  However, I would recommend that new viewers start with earlier seasons.

Below is a short description of each episode in Season 4.  The number in parentheses is my ""scariness rating""; scale = 1-5 with 5 being the scariest.  Minor spoilers throughout.

Dark Wrath - A demon stalks the halls and terrifies the owners of a rural house near St. Louis (3)

The Awakening - Restless ghosts trouble a Midwestern couple (2)

The Calling - She sees dead people.  A young mother is traumatized when her ability to see and interact with the deceased becomes impossible to control (2)

The Apartment - A young Seattle couple are harassed by paranormal visitors when they move into an apartment where a vicious drug battle once took place (1)

Spirits of the Dead - A spooky horse barn is the center of otherworldly events as a dispossessed spirit attempts to control a assemblage of ghosts (2)

Where Evil Lurks - A complex haunting takes place in the Ozarks where a daemon that was summoned in a historically haunted house viciously attacks a young family (4)

Spellbound - Not a typical A Haunting episode.  It mainly deals with the relationship between a son who becomes a devote Christian (and eventually a minister) and his mother who practices Wicca (1)

Echoes of the Past - A family moves into an ancient Vermont home where various spirits, mainly those of two little girls, interact with them (1)

Ghost Hunter - The 15 year old son of a ghost hunter becomes possessed while helping her paranormal research team investigate an old cemetery (1)

Stalked by Evil - A spirit that lurks in the closet of a Texas home becomes obsessed with the teenage daughter of the new residents (3)

Casa de los Muertos - A Latino guitarist and family move into an Arizona house haunted by the spirit of a white supremacist (1)

Monster in the Apartment - A young man who dabbles in the occult eventually becomes possessed by a demon and begins to stalk his female roommate (2)

Legend Trippers - Legend trippers are people who visit allegedly haunted sites to investigate paranormal activity.  In this episode, several groups of teenagers explore an ancient, creepy Wisconsin cemetery (3)",1242777600,31,2988,4.867326732673267
3431088,5,B0019BI0W4,I love this series so much.  I have been watching it on Discovery for years now and Tivo it all the time.  I have seen all of the episodes ever made many times and never get tired of watching them.  I only wish that Discovery would come out with new episodes in this series because I know there are many fans out there who want more.,1242345600,,333,4.015151515151516
3431089,4,B0019BI0W4,Quick delivery.  DVD good quality.  Interesting show.  You can tell how many commericials were in the original broadcast - a lot! And I am glad we don't have to watch all the commercials.,1240704000,,187,4.606060606060606
3431090,5,B0019BI0W4,"Every episode is amazing.  Something weird happened when I was watching the one where the mother had ""an attachment"".  While watching it..I was terrified.  Then..my VW bug that was parked in the garage started honking.
I turned off the alarm, and went back to the show.  This happened two more times during the episode.  I finally figured out that something didn't want me to watch it, and I turned it off.  All the other stories are really great, as well..and there were no honking interruptions.  Spellbound, for sure.",1229817600,2,520,4.840909090909091

3431121,4,B0019BI0W4,"I enjoyed season 4, though not as much as seasons 1 through 3! ""The Awakening"", ""The Apartment"", ""Where Evil Lurks"",""Spellbound"", ""Stalked By Evil""  and ""Monster in the Apartment"" were among my favorites, but ""Dark Wrath"" was my very favorite and to me was the last excellent episode of the original series of the previous decade (seasons 1 - 4)! Nevertheless, season 4 is still much better than most any other horror series or movie I have seen!",1445212800,,446,4.792207792207792
3431122,1,B0019BI0W4,I loved the season. The one star is because I ordered the season twice and both times there was a faulty disk. Don't risk buying this when you don't get to watch all of the awesome episodes.,1444780800,,190,4.162162162162162

3431183,4,B0019BI0W4,This fourth season was not a disappointment because the episodes had strong narratives and decent acting in tales that will make you shudder. What I liked best about this season is that the writing has improved to match some of the better episodes of the first and second seasons. This is definitely worth the viewing.,1402444800,,318,4.8
3431184,5,B0019BI0W4,"I never thought I'd like a show like this, well I do enjoy Ghost Hunters,etc, but one that basically just tells the story instead of doing actual investigations, but this one has a lot of ""scare factors"" that the others don't I really enjoyed this show.",1389398400,,253,4.521739130434782
3431185,3,B0019BI0W4,"On its own, this item is fairly entertaining and well-produced. However, long-time fans of the series will find little different here from the three seasons preceding it. More disturbing to me, however, is the careless packaging: the three discs are not numbered for those who might one to revisit one particular disc or episode; it is impossible to distinguish between the ""play all"" function and ""choose episodes"" on the main start menu since there is no change of color or intesity to let the viewer know which choice he or she is on. All-in-all, almost four stars for a well-done product that unfortunately doesn't cover any new ground past the first three seasons, minus one star for the lazy, careless work on the packaging and menus.",1387324800,,740,4.880952380952381
3431186,5,B0019BI0W4,"If you like shows on the paranormal/supernatural, this is probably the best one you'll watch for overall creepiness. The re enactments are quite scary and really engrossing.",1377302400,,173,5.444444444444445
3431187,5,B0019BI0W4,This show is for anyone who loves the mystery behind the things we cannot explain. All we have are accounts of these wonders. Sometimes the most compelling story cannot be backed up - only told. I feel like that's what this show embodies. Sometimes all you have are words of an incredible event. This show acts out those stories and makes them real again.,1372032000,,355,4.5625
3431188,5,B0019BI0W4,I had Seasons 1 through 3 and was very pleased to finally get Season 4. If you like the show this is the DVD set for you. Great price as well.,1371513600,,142,3.6129032258064515

3431192,5,B0019BI0W4,I love this show. Interesting and pretty scary. A must have for anyone interested in the paranormal. Money well spent.,1353024000,,118,4.95
3431223,4,B0019BI0W4,"Season 4 of A Haunting was good, but you could tell they were starting to run low on story ideas. Although based on actual true stories, this is just re-enactments of what people claim happened to them.

In season four, some of the shows were saddled with poor acting. It also seemed to want to use ""monsters"" rather than ghosts. Some of the stories seemd a little too far fetched to be a real ghost story like they were in earlier seasons.

Although still good, and I would have liked more seasons, it's kind of a blessing the show ended on a high rather than sink to an embarrasing low.",1303344000,,588,4.336363636363636
3431224,5,B0019BI0W4,"I just finished watching H4 and....just like the previous three seasons...
Absolute perfection.
Great stories.
Decent acting.
Scary music.
Perfect narration.
What's not to love?
My favorite episode has to be ""Dark Wrath"". I jumped off the couch more than once during that episode. :)

Anything bad?
Yes, the series ended. :(
Not cool, bring it back Discovery!!!!

A Haunting Season 4 comes.....Highly Recommended.",1276473600,7,413,5.4375
3431225,3,B0019BI0W4,"..if you're not Christian, be prepared for a lot of Wicca bashing. Nothing ever seems to work in these episodes except Christian techniques (there are a couple of exceptions) but the episode ""Spellbound"" is the worst case of inaccuracy in relation to Wicca I've seen on the show. These shows are fun, but the innaccuracy of the presentation of witchcraft and Wicca (not synonymous) is distracting and insulting.",1270080000,2,411,5.0588235294117645
3431226,5,B0019BI0W4,I've got all the seasons available. I enjoy the stories of real people and the paranormal activity they encounter.,1268092800,,114,5.052631578947368
3431227,4,B0019BI0W4,"This season 4 of A Haunting is very entertaining as well as the other seasons. If you like ghost stories than this is something you should get for your DVD library. I am a big fan of hearing about the paranormal. I like the fact that they replay the events that took place in every story. Also, they have the real people that it happened to telling about it. Sometimes for protection they block out their faces to hide their identities. However, this season seems to have an awful lot of stories about demons. If I can remember correctly so did season 3. Even though the stories took place in different areas and to different people it all started to kind of seem the same. I don't know why? For some reason one of the DVD's kind of started to bore me. The other two were just fine. Maybe it is because I saw all of them on T.V. or something. Don't get me wrong though it is still a good buy. It is a well deserved addition to anyones library of DVD's. Happy Haunting",1262908800,,967,4.232432432432432
3431228,5,B0019BI0W4,"It's created like a Sci-Fi movie only with commentaries of stories' witnesses. So sometime you even forget that it based on real stories. The psychological lead of every episode is mysterious and jumpy especially on music which waiting for your attention then breaks silent suddenly out of loud. As I said it made as Sci-Fi what means there are actors and special effects. So it looks very convincing. Unfortunately there is not documentary conformations from story - tellers. I'd expected something like if they telling about scratches made by demons... (Boo!) Well I'd like to see them as photo or video of real evidence not on actors. If there is talk about some hunting place I'd like that some documentary proof would be found in library. There was only one episode ""The calling"" were paranormal investigators found the documented proof in the library of persons who lived in the house or died near by in different centuries. That was interesting... I saw the TV series: ""In the search of"" with Mitch Pileggi. There was man who never believed in paranormal activities, so when it happen to him (he started to paint the portrait of unknown person and write down some notes not anyhow related to his current life) he went to library and made research. And he found the original portrait and notes of some man who lived in 19th century. Well that's the proof! As for ""Haunting"" it's up to you in most of cases to believe it or not.
I studied paranormal on my own for many years including witch board, fortune telling, healing energy movements and so on. So in this movie some facts just made me laugh. But I liked how film is made. It kind of give you shiver on your back because of psychological aspect. It's like in hypnosis practice takes all your attention to scary you at the planned point. So as entertainment I give 5 stars and I'm gonna buy season 3.",1254873600,,1860,4.63939393939394
3431229,5,B0019BI0W4,"Yet another great season in a great series.  The series gets better and better.  Each episode is creepy in its own right.  If you enjoyed watching this on TV, pick this up.",1252281600,,172,4.3125
3431230,5,B0019BI0W4,I have loved this series from the first movie length tales that were televised A Haunting in Georgia and A Haunting in Connecticut.  Two tales that were very disimilar.  A Haunting in Georgia is the tale of a little girl who saw ghosts and had ghostly companions.  A Haunting in Connecticut is the complete opposite.  We see how a demonic presence in what was a renovated funeral home terrify a family to the brink and institutionalize the oldest son in the family to an sanitarium.  I'm not always pleased with seeing the Warrens included in an investigation because I've not made up my mind about them with all the controversy that is still going on about the house in Amityville.  It seems that this team of ghostbusters always sees the demonic in each case.  The spirits are not always malevolent like Heidi's in Georgia.  I've got the complete series on DVD and they are much beloved and well watched.  I've gotten my Dad interested in them as well.  I highly recommend this season.  I also enjoyed the fact that they gave us a play all feature at the main menu rather than making me have to individually select each one to play.,1249948800,2,1134,4.564356435643564
3431231,5,B0019BI0W4,"My mom and I are avid fans of this series, and I have purchased the complete Seasons 1-4 for her [as the discounted price on Amazon makes it a value buy]. I also have the individual seasons. The series stands out because of its high production quality, credible reenactments, and also the eyewitness accounts interspersed with interviews with paranormal experts.

In Season 4, the episodes continue to engage and creep out viewers [in no particular order]:
Ghost Hunter - a paranormal investigator brings her son along to a cemetery and finds that a demon has attached itself to her son.
Stalked by Evil - a mother must do all she can to save her daughter from the clutches of a determined ghost.
Casa De Los Muertos- a father has to draw on his Puerto Rican roots to save his son from an unearthly entity.
Monster in the Apartment - a woman tries to save her cancer-stricken friend from an evil ghost.
Legend Trippers - high school friends find themselves at the mercy of unearthly forces when they investigate a local cemetery.
Spirits of the Dead- a family at a horse-riding school have to battle an unearthly entity.
Where Evil Lurks - a young family faces a demon that threatens their home and lives.
Spellbound - a single mom inadvertently summons an evil entity.
Echoes of the Past- a young couple find their home haunted by spirits, and must do what they can to save their young daughter from the spirits' clutches.
Dark Wrath - a woman faces an evil force bent on destroying her family.
The Awakening - a woman struggles to come to terms with her son's Irag mission, and at the same time is haunted by spirits.
The Calling - a new bride finds her marriage in peril when her psychic abilities attract a restless spirit.
The Apartment - a newly married couple discover the dark history of their apartment.

Once again, the DVDs have no special features, but the stories themselves are engaging, so it did not make much of a difference to me.",1248566400,5,1948,4.610951008645533
