5164441,5,B008H6GHEM,My grandson's favorite movie star is Herbie.  I have tried for a couple of years to get him the old Herbie movies.  His favorite of these is Herbie goes to Monte Carlo.  He will sit and watch this movie from beginning to end - and that's a long time for a 4 year old with a very short attention span.,1353369600,,300,3.966666666666667

5164443,5,B008H6GHEM,Who doesn't love Herbie the Love Bug?  These movies are a fun time.  Great for family movie night and they hold up well.  Getting 4 movies in one collection makes it easy to binge watch or to have the series for consecutive nights.  My personal favorite are the Dean Jones original.,1523836800,,282,4.470588235294118

5164445,1,B008H6GHEM,"I like these movies, the problem is the way they arrived. Although the discs themselves were not damaged, thankfully, the case was a mess. This is not the first time I've had a DVD I've ordered from Amazon come in damaged, but this is the worst incident of it. Both the top and bottom of the case were broken so badly that when closed, I can stick my finger in both holes - yes, holes. These are not mere cracks. There are entire chunks of plastic missing. I'm sorry, Amazon. Normally, I have no complaint. I love ordering from you, but this was badly done.",1522886400,,557,4.314285714285714

I traded email with Disney Support, What a Joke! .. kept asking me the same questions and never even hinted at an answer.  Finally after numerous attempts I got one of my computers to see the file system, rather looked like it was and DVDR that hadn't been closed properly but I still couldn't get the computer DVD program to play it, kept getting disc errors.  So I put in a Replace Ticket with Amazon and just for Giggles and Grins I figured I'd try it out in the DVD player one last time because my 5 yo who just saw the new one was achin to see the old ones .... .... Well it worked!! Got figure! LoL ... I tested each DVD to the title screen and all was good so I don't think it was my fiddlin on the computer because I was only messin with the first two DVDs .. I really don't know unless the stinkin DVD player down loaded an update and/or the stars were just not in the right place in the sky when I attempted to load them a week ago .....

5164900,5,B008H6GHEM,"The DISNEY 4-MOVIE COLLECTION: HERBIE is a collection of the first four movies in Disneys Love Bug series. The first movie in the collection is THE LOVE BUG. In this movie, Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) is an aging race car driver who hasn't had much luck in recent years. He keeps wrecking cars and loosing sponsors. Walking by the show room of a specialized dealership, he notices the beautiful secretary, Carole Bennett (Michele Lee) hanging a sign and decides to go inside and flirt a little. Their conversation is interrupted at first by Ms. Bennett's boss, Mr. Peter Thorndyke (David Tomlinson) and then by a little Volkswagen Beetle deluxe ragtop sedan. Mr. Thorndyke verbally abuses the little car, but Jim sticks up for it. Unbeknownst to everyone, the little car has a head and heart of its own and follows Jim home. His partner and mechanic, Tennessee Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett) immediately falls in love with the car and names him Herbie (in real life the screenwriters took the name Herbie from one of Hackett's comedy routines so it was right that he bestowed the name Herbie upon the car). Jim soon discovers that Herbie isn't like a typically car and eventually enters some races with Herbie and starts winning again. Things start looking up, but Jim's pride and vanity get in the way and threaten to ruin everything, including his racing career and his budding romance with Carole.

I never saw THE LOVE BUG when it was first released in theatres. I wasn't even born, yet. I do know that at an early age in an era before cable and VCRs my brother and I happened to see the Herbie movies and fell in love with the cute little car. THE LOVE BUG was made at a very interesting time, both at Walt Disney and the world at large. Originally released in 1969, the film became the highest grossing movie of that year. Walt himself had died just a few years before and there were many at the time who questioned whether the studio would be able to survive intact. THE LOVE BUG was one of those films that seemed to show the world that even though the founder and creator was dead, his dream would go on. The film represents everything good that Walt Disney tried to portray in all of his movies. For example, that the best things in life don't necessarily come in the biggest and brightest packages, that even though life is difficult you shouldn't give up hope, and that love is a very powerful force of good. It's not hard to see why people flocked to the movie. Just a year before Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy had been assassinated and Chicago erupted in a riot at the Democratic National Convention. People were tired of seeing dark and dreary things. Went they went to the movies they didn't just want to escape. They wanted to be told stories that filled them light, hope, and love.

In the post-modern era we have inherited and are continuing to build, pictures like THE LOVE BUG can be overlooked and thrown to the side for being too innocent. As a whole, we've become much more jaded and cynical and that's not really a good thing.

I like THE LOVE BUG because of those things and I wish filmmakers would make more pictures like it now and again. The world's a dark enough place already. It'd be nice to watch a light-hearted family comedy now and again that wasn't just escapist fare, but reminded us of the best things in life.

Film-buffs should see THE LOVE BUG for a variety of reasons. Besides being the #1 grossing film of 1969 the film is notable for its contribution to the film industry in special effects. THE LOVE BUG was created in an era where there was no such thing as CGI. All of the special effects in THE LOVE BUG were done the old fashioned way and it is amazing how well done they are. These effects might seem old and outdated by a child raised by computer-graphics, but in the era that the film was released the special effects are extraordinary.

Included with this movie, there is the usual commentary (in this case with Dean Jones, Michelle Lee, and Buddy Hackett) and there is a short Disney cartoon entitled ""Susie--the Little Blue Coupe"". This cartoon is a delight to watch and was in the inspiration for the characters in the Pixar film CARS.

Next up is HERBIE RIDES AGAIN. Set several years after THE LOVE BUG, HERBIE RIDES AGAIN is somewhat unusual for a Herbie movie in that it doesnt involve racing. Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) currently isn't using Herbie in racing events and has left him with Mrs. Steinmetz (Helen Hayes), an aunt of Douglas mechanic in the first movie, Tennesse Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett). Herbie watches out for Mrs. Steinmetz and she watches out for him. A young flight attendant, Nicole Harris (Stefanie Powers) is also staying with Mrs. Steinmetz. Meanwhile, Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn) is a major real estate developer and the only thing standing between him and his new project is Mrs. Steinmetz firehouse home. Hawk sends his nephew, Willoughby Whitfield (Ken Berry) to take care of things. Just out of law school, Willoughby does the best he can to get the little old lady to sell, but she won't have it. Eventually, Willoughby understands why Mrs. Steinmetz won't sell. He also becomes smitten with Nicole and eventually joins their side of the struggle against his uncle.

HERBE RIDES AGAIN is a bit more frivolous than THE LOVE BUG. There are a lot of silly antics that really don't have much to do with the plot (e.g. Herbie driving on the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge). Some of these jokes and gags are too forced and don't flow naturally.
Also, in terms of plot, the plot for HERBIE RIDES AGAIN isn't as strong as THE LOVE BUG. Despite these faults, HERBIE RIDES AGAIN is a fun and enjoyable movie. If you enjoyed THE LOVE BUG, youll enjoy seeing HERBIE RIDES AGAIN. Its a fun family film and a must see movie for any Herbie fan.

The third movie in this collection is HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO. Set 12 years after the original THE LOVE BUG (but in reality it was only 8 years after THE LOVE BUG was released), HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO is the third Herbie movie and features the return of Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) and his beloved racing Volkswagen Beetle, Herbie. It's been years since Douglas was a world-class race car driver and he's determined to get back in the circuit and start making a name for himself again by entering in the Monte Carlo Grand Prix, a cross country race from Paris to Monte Carlo. Joining Douglas and Herbie is Jim's friend and mechanic, Wheely Applegate (Don Knotts). The team is all set to race, but then Herbie ends up falling in head over wheels for a beautiful blue and yellow Lancia Montecarlo driven by female driver Diane Darcy (Julie Sommars), who's trying to break into the boys club of racing. Herbie's infatuation proves to be a problem, but there are other issues. Two jewel thieves working for a mysterious Agent X have stolen a large diamond from a museum and have stashed the item in Herbie's gas tank and begin having their own race to corner Herbie and get that diamond back. So, the Grand Prix Monte Carlo becomes a race not only against other racers, but against the thieves, too.

THE LOVE BUG remains the best of the Herbie movies, but HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO is one of the better sequels. The film returns Herbie to his racing roots and it's really great having Dean Jones back in the driver's seat as Jim Douglas. Herbie is the Love Bug after all and a Herbie film wouldn't be complete without a love story or two. There's a good balance in the movie between action, romance, and humor. HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO has lots of laughs, several of which come from Don Knotts mugging it up for the camera  Knotts was a master of the double take and the expressions on his face are priceless. Personally, the only thing I was really disappointed about HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO is that it never addresses what happened to Jim's wife, Carole, from the end of THE LOVE BUG, nor does it say what happened to Tennessee Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett). In terms of DVDs, the HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO features no special features which is a little disappointing.

Overall, HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO is fun and family-friendly movie filled with whimsical delight. It's an entertaining movie and a fine part of the Herbie canon.

The final movie in this special Disney collection is HERBIE GOES BANANAS. The first half of the 1980s was not a good time for Walt Disney studios. Disney had the resources and franchise properties to make successful films, but they wasted those resources and almost ruined those properties on poorly written scripts in an attempt to make a quick buck. Take HERBIE GOES BANANAS, for example.

Herbie, the Love Bug, is a beloved Disney-owned franchise. The original movie had already spawned two fairly successful sequels and there was talk of a possible tv show. However, all of that was put into jeopardy in HERBIE GOES BANANAS. The movie finds Jim Douglas' (Dean Jones) nephew, Pete (Stephan W. Burns) traveling to Mexico to pick up his uncles old racing car to use in a cross-country race in Brazil. He's joined by his mechanic and racing partner D.J. (Charles Martin Smith). Along the way the two friends become victims of a child pickpocket named Paco (Joaquin Garay III). Paco has also stolen wallets from three men looking to find some Aztec gold and so the men start hunting down Herbie and Paco. Meanwhile, Pete and D.J. run into a wealthy woman named Louise (Cloris Leachman) who agrees to bankroll the boys' race and Pete eventually falls for Louise's niece, Melissa (Elyssa Davalos).

You might think that Herbie spends a lot of time with Pete & D.J., but that's not the case. Instead, Herbie becomes close to Paco who calls him ""Ocho"". In fact, Herbie's name is only briefly mentioned once in the entire movie and for the rest of the film he's referred to as Ocho. I remember watching HERBIE GOES BANANAS when I was a young kid and I found Paco really annoying and I couldn't understand why he kept calling Herbie Ocho instead of Herbie. Studios often seem to think that sticking a kid in a role that should belong to an adult makes the movie more endearing. Instead, such a move often drags the movie down. Kids love Herbie, but a child should not be the focus of a Herbie movie.

Anyway, although HERBIE GOES BANANAS is a letdown, there is a little bit of relief thanks to Cloris Leachman and Harvey Korman. Korman plays the captain of the cruise ship and Aunt Louise (Cloris Leachman) is determined to capture his heart before the end of the cruise. Their romantic game of cat and mouse provides some hilarious hijinks.

Overall, HERBIE GOES BANANAS is the worst of the Herbie movies. Fans of Herbie will want to watch it (if nothing else as a reminder of what almost killed Herbie). For general movie watchers, the movie is semi-entertaining if nothing else for the over-the-top comedy of Cloris Leachman and Harvey Korman.

Overall, although not all four movies are worthy of all five stars themselves and I wish there were more extras, if you're a fan of Herbie and are looking to own all four original Herbie films, you really cant go wrong with DISNEY 4-MOVIE COLLECTION: HERBIE.",1398384000,,11168,4.615307150050352

The films are still fun, of course, and the first two are quite allright for us older folk, but found the last two quite boring. The first two are nicely restored, not so the last two..why did they advertise the set as Remastered, when only half of it is?? Still a must see for car buffs, especially Beetle fans..nothing harmful in here, no sex or graphic violence, which is rare among new films these days.. and none of the dreadful profanities and street language today's films are fulll of.

5164982,4,B008H6GHEM,"I remember the first time i popped in Herbie from our old Block Buster movie rental store when i was about 6 or 7 and remembered watching The LoveBug.. Overtime i grew to love Herbie and every movie he had ever been in. Now i am writing a review about the entire movie collection (minus the crappy and sorry for taste in words.. But the horribly done remake for Herbie Fully Reloaded..) I was walking around in my work at Target and saw this movie on sale for $13 seeing it my entire childhood came back remembering all my favorite Herbies but watching it now i have this to say. ""It is still as enjoyable as ever but to a point with certain movies."" What i mean by that is as you grow older of course movies don't seem to be as cool as they used to.. Now time for why i say that.

My 2 favorite movies in this entire collection have to be the ones that started the series with our star Jim Douglas as our race driver for Herbie. In the Love Bug Herbie is neglected by a car salesmen and sees Jim as his wanting to be owner and runs off to find him. Eventually Jim grows to like the car because of how it can race for the time being. Finally Jim and Herbie develop a friendship as the end of the movie finishes. This movie in my eyes has withstood the test of time and is still one movie from the collection i'll pop in any day.

Moving on to Herbie Rides again this one to me didn't do as well.. I just didn't understand why Jim Gave up Herbie to the older lady and if that woman was really batty in the head or not.. But anyway going off topic... The story is about a greedy owner who wants to make a new building over her husbands firehouse station and its up to Herbie to put an end to the bad guys once again. This movie to me i dunno it was more trippy than i could understand and i think when making this one they were trying to come up with some different ideas but to me it wasn't that appealing.. I mean a Herbie with like Shark Teeth? I think someone got a little too into the ""Acid"" if you know what i mean. LOL But otherwise the movie is still good not my favorite but very good..

Herbie goes to Monte Carlo Now this one again we have Jim Douglas and Herbie back together heading off to Paris and overseas to start a comeback and show the world what a little ""Bug"" can really do. (Also having Film Legend Don Knotts from Andy Griffith and many other amazing TV Shows and Films.) At the same time some thieves are trying to steal a very expensive diamond and get away with it only on accident slipping away the evidence inside Herbies Gas Tank. As the movie goes on you'll see Herbie falling in love with another car (Jezzle what she is called later in the movie) and Races to take 1st place in the Monte Carlo race. This again was another amazing movie from the Herbie series.. I think they should have never seperated Herbie and Jim from each other cause they are like tied to each other. Again GREAT Movie from the collection Will pop it in Anyday.

Herbie Goes Bananas Now this one was the one that got me a little Upset. In this the only thing that you see is one spot where Herbie actually asks like a Race Car. Now I am glad that the boy (Paco who is a orphan) made Herbie his friend during the movie yes but I still consider this movie the other weak link in the entire series.. I wanted to see the new owner actually drive in the Brazil GrandPrix but no during the entire movie we have Paco getting locked up having to carry around a VERY annoying captain, seeing a bull fight, (i will admit that part was pretty funny and enjoyable) To three men going after some Very Valuable Inca Treasure that's worth Millions of Dollars. Even to the point where i was like What the Fudge at part of the film of the Cops Herbie chasing after a airplane that is missing its tail and wings and etc (After Herbie destroys it all.) The film to me at first seemed to be good  But otherwise as the film went on it wasn't anywhere near as good as the first and 3rd movies in the entire collection.

Overall, remember everyone has to have a kid inside them during some of these movies, But as you get older seeing them some of them just aren't as memorable.. I was one that grew up enjoying Herbie racing not going around in Bull Fights and etc. But still other than that all four movies are good but in my honest opinion the first and third will always be my most treasured of all the Herbie movies. Very Good Collection for the Price despite not being in Widescreen for all of them..(I prefer Full Screen) If you've never seen the Herbie Movies I recommend buying this collection cause these are timeless classics just be prepared for some of you older adults to have some moments on the 2nd and 4th one to where it will be a little ""Trippy"" lol",1355356800,30,4748,4.166666666666667
