3849887,5,B0025X4PIS,"I love the Milwaukee  Road! And this all about Milwaukee  Road Steam, with a plot thrown in, that will make ya cry!",1355702400,,115,4.181818181818182
3849888,4,B0025X4PIS,Film and train buffs take note. Danger Lights was also filmed in widescreen (65MM 2.1 aspect ratio.) It was only shown in two theaters. It has never surfaced but I have hope that one day it will. It would be an amazing movie to view.,1303084800,2,233,4.2
3849889,5,B0025X4PIS,THE BEST RAILROAD MOVIE TO COME OUT OF THE 1930'S. THE LOCOMOTIVE TUG OF WAR FIGHT IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THE MOVIE. WOLHEIM AND ARMSTRONG ARE PERFECT IN THEIR ROLES AS COMPETITIVE RAILROAD MEN IN LOVE WITH JEAN ARTHUR.THE CLIMAX OF THE FILM IS A 100 MPH FLIGHT OF MERCY TO SAVE WOLHEIM'S LIFE.IF YOU LOVE RAILROADS LIKE I DO YOU HAVE TO GET THIS MOVIE.

3849891,1,B0025X4PIS,As a retired railroad worker I have a different view of this movie than the general public. This movie is TERRIBLE it so bad that it's laughable!!!  My old shop was near where the film was made so most of my coworkers watched it when we were trashed. The ensuing laughter was as unstoppable as one of Dan Thorne's trains. I will say the cinematography is quite good but the acting and story line are insipid. This absurd movie would be the perfect gift for the pothead railroad man in your life.,1418083200,,495,4.380434782608695
3849892,5,B0025X4PIS,"I enjoy the old style stories, if somewaht simple in plot.",1413158400,,58,4.363636363636363
3849893,5,B0025X4PIS,Love the train scenes In this movie.  The one with the two engines going head to head in a pushing contest on the round table was great.,1412121600,,136,4.037037037037037
3849894,5,B0025X4PIS,Average story but some great train shots especially two locos having a tug of war !!,1404604800,,84,4.3125
3849895,5,B0025X4PIS,I would recommend this for anyone interested in old trains. I loved it. Didn't pay attention to the plot....just the great train pics,1400630400,,133,4.826086956521739
3849896,5,B0025X4PIS,Super scenes of the old Milwaukee Road western division filmed in Montana in 1930 great for rail buffs interested in the Milwauke road.,1387670400,2,135,4.913043478260869
3849897,4,B0025X4PIS,"This is one the best movies to show the aspects of the way railroading was in those days, don't pay to much attention to the plot after all it is an old movie, but the railroad scenes are the best I have ever seen. Two things to watch for, the tug of war, and greasing the journal on the way to Chicago.",1377388800,,303,3.903225806451613
3849898,5,B0025X4PIS,"I found this picture to be a real charmer, and the Locomotive equipment was old Milwaukee road and Burlington steam.",1373587200,,116,4.85
3849899,5,B0025X4PIS,"For anyone who loves films of vintage steam trains , this film is a great surprise . The story is a little trite , but this fact is more than made up for by great filming of steam trains . Also, it was a treat to see Jean Arthur in one of her early films",1365120000,,254,3.6363636363636362
8351297,5,B0025X4PIS,Anyone who is a rail-fan must have this.,1519948800,,40,4.125
8351298,4,B0025X4PIS,A good prewar  movie about a RR family.  There is a lot of action with steam trains.,1517875200,,84,3.8823529411764706
8351299,5,B0025X4PIS,"If you like old railroading, you'll like this -- but maybe not the plot so much.  Very cool old railroad scenes.",1509148800,,112,4.333333333333333
8351300,3,B0025X4PIS,"Getting a DVD from Alpha is always a lucky dip.  This one is OK. The run time is correct and the video, although a bit blurry, is still quite watchable and the audio is not too shabby either.  Have seen a lot worse from Alpha. If you can get it for a few bucks then well worth it.",1496448000,,280,3.810344827586207
8351301,5,B0025X4PIS,"The first time I saw the movie, on TV, I didn't think too much about it -- until I saw the Herald of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific RR.  All the trains in the movie were of the Milwaukee Road.  MY RAILROAD.  I was raised by my grandfather who worked the Milwaukee for over 30 years.  His birthday present to me when I turned 7 was to drive a steam locomotive.  I now have over a hundred units of the Milwaukee Road in HO scale.  Umm, no.  Wait.  I have a couple in O scale I picked up at my model train club raffles.  Also a G scale meat reefer I got at an auction.  Well, you get the idea.  I've picked out some boo boos just for the fun of it.  For example, when Armstrong is cleaning out the fire box, he's doing it on a large Mikado engine whereas the race to Chicago he was supposedly driving a Milwaukee built Pacific (under license from Baldwin the MILWRR built their own high speed Pacific locos).  Well, you get the idea.  I like movies dealing with Railroads, Battleships (I'm the Naval Architect for the USS Iowa here in San Pedro) & Sci-Fi.  But this movie is at the top of my list.",1458777600,,1106,4.102803738317757
8351302,3,B0025X4PIS,ok,1445558400,,2,2.0
8351303,5,B0025X4PIS,"Old train buffs will love this movie. Acting is fair, film quality is OK for 1930's and there are no special effects",1431475200,,116,4.318181818181818
8351304,5,B0025X4PIS,Good family entertainment.,1431302400,,26,8.0
8351305,5,B0025X4PIS,"Dan Thorn for prime minister! He gets things done. Only kidding.....he must be dead by now.
Loved this film, great locomotive scenes, tug o' war was terrific.
Jean Arthur was a darling girl as well.

8351306,5,B0025X4PIS,"Interesting early talkie is beautifully filmed, giving viewers a railroad trip from Montana to Chicago while telling a standard love-triangle story. Print on the Alpha DVD is pretty good, being full-length and not the 20 minute shorter TV print commonly seen. This was originally filmed simultaneously in a 63mm wide-screen process called Naturalvision. Only two theaters ever showed this version, which no longer exsists. Musicals were out of fashion in late 1930, so RKO filmed this with a quasi-documentary look, similar to their other film in release at the time, THE SILVER HORDE, which features many scenes of a salmon cannery in operation. DANGER LIGHTS offers something different to the viewer, and something essential for railroad buffs.",1423008000,4,746,5.384615384615385
