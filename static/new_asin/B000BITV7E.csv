8087282,5,B000BITV7E,"In this rare classic TV series, People sent in letters requesting things they would like to see on TV. In the 4 episodes on this DVD, we see a german brass band, a fire eater, a deadly snake, the tricks behind scams, the ""Our Gang"" kids, a hawaiian cowboy, among other things. The result is facinating viewing, which is sorta like the 50's version of ""YouTube"". Includes original comnmercials for peanut butter.",1208390400,4,411,4.722222222222222
