8609273,4,B00ET9LDY0,"I think I would rate this DVD higher if the author would have demonstrated his movements in a slower more learnable manner and taken more time to explain each technique. It is obvious that he has skill in Kali but the video just doesn't deliver on the teaching end they way it could have.

The sword and knife techniques demonstrated here are standard to the Pekiti-Tersia Kali family. It would be nice to see more conceptual based combat application.  By that I mean someone demonstrating their own fighting methods based off solid PTK concepts. It gets kind of old seeing the same stuff over and over.

I'll give this one 4 Stars.",1520553600,3,632,4.625
