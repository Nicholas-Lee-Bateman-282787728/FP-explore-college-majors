4663487,5,B005E7SEOI,"THE HONEYMOONERS is arguably the longest running 'sitcom' on TV. However the description so far is very sketchy. Exactly what episodes are included? I have every episode I could lay my hands on, including a few Dumont episodes starring Pert Kelton as Alice. Will they have more Dumont episodes? Will they have the black and white musicals? Will they include the black and white special episode ""The Adoption'? Will the many current episodes I already have be restored and look much better? These are questions I'd really like to find out. I hope when it gets closer to its release MPI will give a full description of episodes included in this set.",1312156800,21,647,4.785714285714286
4663488,5,B005E7SEOI,"This box-set will include:
  15 DVD set of the complete existing collection of all HONEYMOONERS skits produced from 1951-1957
  Approximately 50 hours of material, including over 10 hours of HONEYMOONERS productions not seen since the 1950s
  First-time-ever home video release of the 8 sought-after 1957 HONEYMOONERS musical hours not seen anywhere in over 5 decades
  First-time-ever home video release of half-a-dozen other HONEYMOONERS skits from The Jackie Gleason Show recently found in the vaults.
  First-time-ever DVD appearance of 8 surviving HONEYMOONERS skits from the 1951-1952 Cavalcade of Stars variety show.
  Digitally restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive
  Deluxe 42 page booklet with full HONEYMOONERS history and rare photos, compiled by Honeymooners expert Robert Bader.

One of television's most influential and beloved comedy programs, THE HONEYMOONERS first appeared in 1951 as a series of skits on television's ""Cavalcade of Stars"" before comic great Jackie Gleason was given his own program a year later. From 1952-1955 and 1956-1957, ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" featured dozens of classic HONEYMOONERS productions broadcast live nationwide on CBS-TV, airing only once. For decades, these early HONEYMOONERS telecasts were lost until Jackie Gleason began releasing them from his private film vault.

  Now, in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the very first HONEYMOONERS skits, MPI Home Video and Jackie Gleason Enterprises present the most complete collection possible of these rare gems, many of which have not been seen anywhere in 50 years or available previously on DVD. It's a treasure trove of the hilarious antics of hapless Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden (Jackie Gleason), his long-suffering but loving wife Alice (Audrey Meadows), Ralph's neighbor and pal, sewer worker Ed Norton (Art Carney) and Norton's wife Trixie (Joyce Randolph). This is a must-have collection for any fan of classic television comedy which appeals to laugh-loving viewers of all ages.

MPI Home Video has announced that on October 4th they will release The Honeymooners Lost Episodes: The Complete Restored Series on DVD. This package includes Behind the Scenes bonus material, Featurettes, Interviews, Commercials, and Skits.",1311811200,124,2253,5.632047477744807

4663539,5,B005E7SEOI,"What can I say that hasn't already been said in the other reviews. When you watch these it's then that you can see the raw comedy talent.  Using nothing more than painted back drops, live musical orchestrations and the energy of being aired live, that is when you begin to understand the talent these people really had.

The mistakes and improvisations are priceless. Like when Art Carney is trying to get out of a room and the door is locked. Now THAT'S comedy !!!

When people watch these they think how simple they were. Yes the sets were. But the comedic talent and writing is timeless and stands as some of the greatest classic comedy TV ever made. If you think these are too basic then try watching your average sitcom from the 70's and 80's.

To bad they never really aired these on a regular basis as well.",1475020800,2,814,4.442953020134228

4663578,5,B005E7SEOI,"Like the three disc Jack Benny-The Lost Episodes set,this 60th Anniversary set of the Honeymooners-The Lost Episodes is a misnomer. They were never lost at anytime. Jackie Gleason himself had the foresight to put his shows to Kinescope;a process whereby a a camera is pointed at a TV set and laid onto(in this case)16mm film. He did this from 1951 when he was on the Dumont network and then did the same from /52 to /57 on CBS.From here he stored them properly in air conditioned vaults until he released them in 1985. Like the Benny's these kines were remastered by the UCLA film and TV archive in California. The picture and sound quality vary from ep to ep of course due to the film and sound quality(or lack thereof).I think though it is the best we're going to ever get for these shows. I for one am just grateful The Great One had the means to preserve these shows. Personally,considering each entire show is preserved in toto,I would like to have see them in their complete form. However beggars can't be choosers.
This set contains 15 one sided discs all in snug plastic holders,with the entire set done in book-like form(i.e.one disc on one side of the ""page"",turn the ""page"" and there's another disc on the opposite side,then over to the next page,turn over for the next,etc.,etc.).It contains a nice informative booklet explaining what the history of the ""lost""eps is about and a detailed listing of each ep c/w air dates. The 15th disc is chock full of extraordinary extras,including featurettes,rare clips relating to Carney/Norton and two radio performances of the Honeymooners.
Being live television anything could happen,and in these eps you will see and hear many a flub. Props that don't work,Carney and Gleason both taking tumbles,surprise special guests and general faux pauxs by all the cast and supporting players. They don't happen that frequently but when they do,be prepared for even bigger laughs. The /51 season starts off with Pert Kelton as Alice, and you will find a more harsh relationship between the two characters. When Audrey Meadows comes in for the /52 season onwards the harshness slowly diminishes over time. As the actors/characters develop their chemistry and dynamic, the magic that we all know and love from the Classic 39 starts to peek through and flourish. By the time /54 rolls around it's all there and it just gets better and better. Come /57 and Gleason jumps into eight musical Honeymooners. Watch them for the comedy,you bet,but also marvel at his supporting players,the extraordinary June Taylor dancers and the musical geniuses of Jerry Bressler and Lyn Duddy who wrote the music and lyrics,and conductor Ray Block who puts it all out there with his orchestra.
In conclusion, for the Honeymooners fan in your life there is no better gift than this 15 disc set. I got this as a present from my daughter for Xmas and I have laughed my way through every precious second of these shows. These are historically important pieces of video,which should also interest those who love old TV programming. A big thanks to The Great One for being who he was(he had an enormous impact on my life),who brought together and surrounded himself with some of the best talent on the planet, and who left us an unparalleled TV legacy that now,more than 60 years on, we can look back at and enjoy,be entertained and above all laugh at,until the tears start to flow.",1453939200,,3397,4.828473413379074

4663620,3,B005E7SEOI,"I'm not a Honeymooners fanatic so I may not be the ideal person to review this. I always found Art Carney brilliant and lovable; Gleason? I often found him annoying, obnoxious, and someone I would not want in my family or neighborhood. I know; I'm in the minority here. That being said, I did enjoy enough of the ""Classic"" 39 episodes to buy this boxed set. I admit it, I bought it more for Carney than Gleason, and a love of early television. Some of these shows are from 1951, for goodness sake AND the long dead Dumont network. All that was going to tempt me to put out my cold hard cash for it sooner or later.
So what do you get? A heck of a lot. 50 hours on 15 dvds, chock full of rarities, interviews, featurettes, etc. You definitely get your money's worth as far as quantity goes. But how good is it?
The earliest shows (really sketches from Gleason's variety show, Calvacade of the Stars) are dismal. They are little more than Gleason yelling at his wife (NOT played by Audrey Meadows but by Pert Kelton (who later got blacklisted during the McCarthy era)). An earlier era of difficult divorce laws and narrow women's roles may have made this amusing to audiences back then but many people today would see nothing here but an abusive relationship in an impoverished environment. Gleason is nasty in these sketches. With time, you see the sketches and characters develop closer to the Honeymooners we remember. At first, this isn't too entertaining but it's interesting; just don't expect a lot of laughs. Eventually, as you wade through the 50 hours here you get some entertainment.
For completists and Honeymooners fanatics who need more than the Classic 39, this is essential. It's an iffy purchase for eveyone else. If you weren't interested in early tv, you might regret this one. I don't regret my purchase but I doubt that I will watch this more than one time.",1430092800,15,1876,4.602985074626866

Many of which were made into longer, 1/2 hour shows when The Honeymooners where shown as a weekly program after the Calvacade of Stars and the Jackie Gleason Show were no longer on the air.

They are downright crude, in fact-- a war of insults being hurled back & forth. However, they are vital in showing how this series developed into greatness. Life ain't kind to Ralph Kramden, but at least he has Alice. You just wonder why she married him in the first place. Some of the episodes are very special, even though they seem to be out of their proper element. For example, the episodes when the Kramdens & Nortons go to Ireland & then England. Where did Ralph & Ed ever get the money to do that kind of travel? However, they are extremely important in showing just how talented Jackie Gleason was.

If you are a Jackie Gleason fan, you will find this set indispensable. If you know little or nothing about The Honeymooners, you probably won't appreciate it. I am very thankful that we have these rare videos. Jackie Gleason truly was THE GREAT ONE!",1402790400,4,1002,4.535911602209945

I never knew there was another Alice Kramden but there was way back at the beginning. There are also musical Honeymooners episodes which i didn't even know existed. Having had the :ORIGINAL 39: EPISODES it is so nice to have this to add to them. You will see a few duplicate skits but they are always redone in a fresh and funny manner. The earlier skits run from about 5 mins to 13 mins and gradualy get longer. What i always felt made the Honeymooners so funny and so good was the excellent chemistry between Ralph,Ed,Alice and Trixie. Considering the time factor the audio and video dvd transfer is quite good. There is not one dull moment out of 15 dvds. 14 dvds of good old fashioned Honeymooners and 1 dvd of fantastic xtras.

4663676,5,B005E7SEOI,"If ,like me, you love the Honeymooners then you must get this collection. there is a sort of chauvanism about 'the classic 39"" in which they are treated as Canon and the lost episodes are considered a step below  and in the opinion of some an inferior product, and though i agree the technical quality of the 39 is superior, i have to say there is something about the lost episodes that the 39 does not have: there is a energy level and a spontaneity about them, a liveliness, a sense of fun and adventure,that i find ecstatically pleasing, as well as hilarious.
  These skits run the gamut from one act quickies, to 3 act hour long adventures.one skit, famously, ran so long, the show ended before the skit finished, and gleason had to start the following weeks show by telling the audience how the skit ended. In this kind of anything can happen atmosphere you really saw Gleason at his best, commanding the stage, improvising on the spot, it just shows how talented Art Carney and Audrey Meadows were in that they could keep up with him in that kind of environment . Famous for not rehearsing when he was doing the classic 39, you know there was even less in that regard for these skits. Gleason said he didn't like to rehearse because it ruined his 'spontaneity ', he also said that one of the reasons the Honeymooner skits worked so well, beside the chemistry between him and carney, was the Live audience, he said "" a live audience will work you around a skit, it'll let you know whats working and whats flopping,"" all of that intrinsic knowledge of how to work a sketch is right here on full display, as you watch a master at work.
  I can best explain how great these sketches are by focusing on just two of the many.
  In the sketch ' Champagne and Caviar "" Ralph has invited the Boss over to dinner, to impress him ( in the hopes of getting a raise) he blows his whole weeks salary on champagne and caviar and Havana Cigars, of course it backfires, but the payoff to the sketch has a flub by the actor playing the Boss that had me lauging so hard i thought i would die. The Boss is suppose to say: "" come to my office tomorrow, my board of directors will be there, they want to give the men a raise, i want you there so i can tell them how well a man like you can live on 62 dollars a week"" he had asked Raplh how much he was making and Ralph had answered 62 so we knew his weekly salary, the trouble is the actor says: "" how well you can live on 45 dollars a week."" instead, which implied to me that not only wasn't Ralph getting a raise he instead was getting a 17 dollar reduction in salary, the look on Ralphs face when the Boss says this has to be seen to be believed, as his excitement is replaced by a look of stunned disbelief. Its one of the funniest things i have ever seen.
  On this same disk ( there are 15 altogether) in 'Letter to the Boss', Gleason gives one of the great slow burn soliliques of all time, he thinks The Boss has fired him, and he decides to dictate a letter to Norton  while still frothing in venom and Hate, "" Dear Mr Marshall....You Dirty Bum ""  is just for starters, its hilarious as Ralph vents his spleen "" you oughta turn in your membership card to the Human Race,"" Ralph ends the letter this way :"" respectfully yours, etc,etc"" of course it being Ralph, he has it all wrong, he's not being fired he's being promoted, now he must get that letter back, and all out hilarity prevails.
  I have always thought it was amazing how Gleason a millionaire who lived the life of a millionaire to the hilt could unfailingly channel Ralph Kramden, when he is Ralph, the sruggling working stiff, there isn't a trace of Gleason the millionaire visible, its as  though he really becomes Ralph.
  Art Carney of couse is equally amazing. In Ed Norton he created as beloved and unique a character as there has ever been. Norton adores and worships Ralph, and Ralph of course needs Norton : his audence and supporter just as bad. But Norton never fails to lift Ralph up just so he can absent mindedly drop him in the next second. The Timing of Carney is perfectly exquisite. example: Ralph is nervous a psychiatrist is going to put him in a straight jacket, so Norton says in a very sweet heartfelt way, "" Don't worry Ralph they'll never put you in a straight Jacket,"" Ralph is touched by the supportive words, but in the next second Norton applies the zinger : "" Where they going to find one big  enough"" I have always felt that it secretly delighted Norton to see Ralph steamed, and why not, it was hilarious, so he did his best to drive him crazy.""
  As for Audrey Meadows, she played Alice perfectly, sweet one second and brassy the next, sharp and intelligent, she knew just how to play each scene so Gleason got the most out of the skit. she channeled Alice in the same manner Gleason did Ralph, as both of them were nothing like the characters they played
  And of course it wouldn't  be right not to mention Joyce Randolph as Trixie, she certainly did the most with the little material she had to work with, but in her own way is just as big a part of the show. I like the way she continually zings Ralph. In one episode Ralph is making  big deal because he sprained his thumb, he comes into the kitchen with the Thumb all bandagd up, Trixie is nonplused: "" How long did you lay in the street befor they moved You?""
  There are so many hilarious skits on these discs that i could do this all night, so do yourself a favor, order this today, and if you have a Honeymooner fan in the family , one who knows exactly what""humana humana"" means, well now you have the perfect holiday gift.",1380844800,11,5622,4.2961210974456

Even with many the intervening years I still find them funny and entertaining. Ralph always starts as self centered and gruff and ends re-affirming his love for his wife.

4663693,3,B005E7SEOI,"First let me say I did not buy this because they advertised it as ""Restored"" and I wasn't expecting much in that area. I have watched most of these in TV Syndication (on WPIX in NY) re-runs that Gleason did in 85 and like most Honeymooner's fans simply wanted the ""complete"" set.

As for completeness this is as good as you can get. 15 DVDs with all the Lost Episodes that were on TV as re-runs plus many that were not. So for a fan or collector this is it.

Video Quality: I am not sure what they meant by ""restored"" as the source material was taken from the ""Video Tape"" copies made years ago instead of going back to the original masters and doing a new A/D transfer so some episodes due have analog artifacts from the tapes.

Audio Quality: The audio NR was completely ""butchered"" by someone who doesn't know how to do proper NR. This is a common amateur job in removing too much of the noise and the actual quality is seriously degraded. As a result some of the audio has a ""ringing noise"" and more commonly a 'tin-can' sound. The proper way would have been to leave some of the ""hiss"" or ""noise"" in, but they removed 100% instead of around 40%-60% - just terrible! Obviously not done by a professional audio engineer.

On an interesting note, the credits in the booklet state ""Video Restoration: UCLA Film & Television Archive"" which would presumably also include the audio, so a bunch of college kids tried to use Adobe NR? Or perhaps the professor wanted to show them that ""this"" is NOT how proper audio NR is done and mistakenly put the crap tracks on the master discs? Whatever the reason as I stated the audio NR is not properly done by a professional studio/engineer it was obviously done by someone who never did this before...shame as it really hurts the collection.

Overall: If you want a complete set, plus all the extras and you can live with the poor remastering then this is a good set.

Personally I don't like cheap ""remastering"" and they could have taken the time to pay a professional studio to do this properly or simply left the audio as it was, as it's better then this crap, considering this is an $80 set. There's no excuse for it!",1358640000,13,2160,4.428211586901763

How can I say this? These lost episodes are also aired on channel 20 in Phoenix. We have watched them on television and I think the picture and sound quality of the episodes on television is better than the so called ""remastered"" DVD's.

4663698,3,B005E7SEOI,"I bought this based on all the 5-Star reviews even though I always thought the ""lost episodes"" generally didn't rise to the level of the ""classic 39"" episodes we all grew up with. Unfortunately, that point is proven again with this collection. Don't get me wrong, it's a very well put-together package for any fan, in the same way a Beatles fan might search out those early 60s concert performances in Germany....interesting, but the creativity level was not at its peak.

Around the time before 1956, Jackie Gleason incorporated the ""loudmouth"" character into Ralph, but had not yet embedded ""the poor soul"" into the Ralph persona. He screamed a lot, but there was no ""I'm a mope""....no ""you're right again Alice; you're always right.""  Ralph's personality was not fully developed. And after the classic 39, the magic was fading (The Honeymooners as a musical? Really?)

Also, the bonus features are nothing spectacular. I prefer the Honeymooners original theme with the Buick promo and the anniversary special (both from the classic 39 set)  to anything here.

So that's my take....glad I bought it but just wanted to balance out the other reviews which collectively would make one think these shows are as good as the ""classic 39"". They're not. Relatively speaking, the writing and acting just don't quite measure up. But it's still a good ""extra"" for any Honeymooners fan's collection.",1352851200,21,1389,5.021739130434782

The best among the first half I've watched thus far is an episode in which Ralph finds a baby on his bus, takes it home to Alice and wants to keep it. Like many of these Lost Episodes, it of course has its funny moments, but the show really works because it has such a human element. Ralph and Alice not having children never was an issue with the Classic 39 and it's touching to see it here, sort of the way many M*A*S*H episodes mix comedy and poignant drama.",1344816000,6,739,4.211267605633803

4663710,5,B005E7SEOI,"If you own the Classic 39 that was released a number of years ago and are a Honeymooners fan you'll want this collection.  Many of the sketches have not been seen since they were originally broadcast or at least not since their original season when they may have been shown as reruns.  The contents here are obscure and not quite up to the Classic 39's superior production values (shot on film vs. Kinescope), but true fans will enjoy watching the episodes and sketches, and owning this set in their collection.  Warning, the concept of ""complete"" refers to and assumes you already owning the Classic 39.  Those episodes are NOT included in this collection, so you do need both sets to have a full compilation of the Honeymooners.  There are apparently several pieces that are indeed lost.  The creators of this set put considerable effort into finding everything shot of Ralph, Alice and the Norton's, but there are a few pieces or segments that are simply gone.  Perhaps they will surface someday in someone's attic or private collection, but until then this closes out the genre on DVD.  I definitely recommend this set but only for true fans.  The casual fan of the Classic 39 will not appreciate this set and probably won't watch much of it.  For those fans purchase the Classic 39 which I believe remains available on Amazon.  The Honeymooners was landmark television for anyone who lived through the 50's and of course all the decades of syndicating the Classic 39 that followed.  I believe there are some places where it's still shown even today.  By the way, during syndication the Classic 39 were irreverently chopped up to create room for adding many more commercials than what was the norm when they were originally created, so when you get and watch that set it's like seeing those episodes anew with restoration of a good five minutes of long-edited out content.",1324944000,17,1876,4.788819875776397
4663711,5,B005E7SEOI,"Firstly, it was about time MPI released the complete Lost Honeymooners collection, as opposed to their previous piecemeal, poorly packaged multi-volume set of the same.  The new set is smartly packaged and notated, and includes episodes not included in the previous release (one wonders whether MPI was saving them for this -- another round of marketing!).  Additionally, trailers are included promoting new MPI collections of the color Honeymooners episodes from later Gleason shows, thus insuring yet ANOTHER round of profiteering.  The MPI stockholders must be happy, but these later episodes should have been included in this ""complete"" collection, for crying out loud.

OK, I'm done venting. I have little to add to the comprehensive reviews above but will contribute a few comments.  I'd looked forward eagerly to viewing the eight episodes of the Jackie Gleason Show featuring the Kramdens and Nortons traveling around the world (having won the Flakey-Wakies slogan contest), but was left with mixed feelings after seeing them.  There was a lot of singing and dancing, as musical comedies require, of course, but I found them a bit repetitive and over the top. Likewise, the cast bursting into song put me off and made the episode drag, and finally, the writing was not as crisp as one finds in the regular sketches. The worst of the lot may be the cast's trip to Africa in ""I Remember Mau Au."" (I'm surprised someone at MPI let that slip by -- the actual title of the episode was ""I Remember Mau Mau."")  Of more interest to me were the openings of the show (with ""glamorous"" ladies introducing Gleason and cast) and the final moments of the show where Gleason would come out on stage, make a comment or two, bring the cast out for a curtain call, compliment musical director Ray Bloch (""the Flower of the Musical World"") and thank the audience.

One unexpected joy in this set can be found in the Bonus Features disc: a well written ""Honeymooners"" parody from the Jack Benny Show (January 1958) starring Audrey Meadows, Benny as Ralph and Dennis Day as Norton.  I don't know what Benny drank or smoked before this performance, but it is immensely entertaining, surpassed only by Day's inspired impression of Norton.

Finally, it surprised me that the cast performed ""Christmas Party"" three times ('51-'53), each time with different guest performers.  MPI had previously included only the '53 episode with Frances Langford and that kid who belted out ""Walkin' My Baby Back Home,"" but the earlier parties featured different guests, such as a young Frankie Avalon playing the trumpet and tap dancing, and a juggling kid with a tremendous act.  Needless to say, I enjoyed seeing the slight comic variations of the Gleason Show regulars who filled out the ""Party"" episodes from year to year -- Fenwick Babbit, the Poor Soul, Joe the Bartender, Rudy the Repairman, and especially Reggie VanGleason, who each year brought a different band with him and outdid himself dancing with the chorus girls.

In conclusion, while I have a bone to pick with MPI, I'm nonetheless grateful for this release and recommend it as essential viewing for fans of Gleason and company.",1323993600,5,3165,4.971590909090909

One thing to be aware of is some skits are repeated throughout the years. Though it's ok to me to see a twist to the episode as well as the different actors used in the skits.

4663716,5,B005E7SEOI,"This is perhaps one of the greatest box sets ever released. All known surviving segments done live on ""The Cavalcade of Stars"" and ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" from 1951 to 1957 are presented here for Honeymooners fanatics like me. The quality of the kinescopes used on this set are pretty good. I also enjoyed  finally seeing host announcer Jack Lescoulie get some screen time on this set, but too brief in my humble opinion. I have enjoyed reading most of the positive reviews written by people on Amazon but most of them really don't talk too much about the famed original ""Trip To Europe"" musical episodes done by Jackie Gleason, Art Carney, Audrey Meadows, and Joyce Randolph. Comparing the original 1957 version to the 1966 version is like comparing apples to oranges, but if forced to tell everyone which version I like I'll go with the original 1957 version. First, the 1957 version was done after the original cast have been together for nearly 5 years. All knew their characters quite well and played them to perfection. Unfortunately Shelia MacRae and Jane Kean, who played Alice and Trixie in the 1960's remakes, were forced to play their characters for the the first time with Jackie Gleason and Art Carney in the remade 1966 version. Sheila MacRae and Jane Kean would eventually make their new roles as Alice and Trixie their own, but not at this point. Art Carney was at his creative peak playing Ed Norton in 1957. He had already won the Emmy 5 times and would later prove to everybody what a great character actor he was on various television shows in the next few years. Unfortunately by the time Art Carney returned to ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" in 1966 he had put on some weight and suffered a nervous breakdown. The fat jokes aren't as funny told by a fatter Art Carney to the more relaxed Jackie Gleason who seemed to love his lifestyle down in Florida better than New York. After completing the musical episodes in 1957, the original cast would only do 2 more skits (unfortunately only 1 survives) before ending it's 1950's run. I noticed that some of the original Lyn Duddy and Jerry Bresler songs were dropped in ""Curse of the Kramdens"" and ""Framed In Spain"" episodes and new ones were written in their place. ""Hospitality"" and ""You Mustn't Judge A Book By It's Cover""(done in 1966) replaced ""A Kramden Through and Through"" and ""Anything That You Say Is True""(done in 1957). I thought Jackie Gleason and Audrey Meadows sang the original songs better even though the new ones are probably better written tunes. I didn't realize how good Audrey Meadows really sings until I saw these 1957 shows. She and Jackie make quite a singing duo! What I can't understand is how these original ""Trip To Europe"" episodes took so long to get released. They are magical and should of gotten more acclaim back in the 1950's but unfortunately ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" was up against ""The Perry Como Show"" who got better ratings at the time. I hope one day MPI will release the famed ""Adoption"" musical episode that reunited Jackie Gleason with Art Carney, and Audrey Meadows in January 1966. This episode prompted Jackie Gleason to bring back ""The Honeymooners"" in the 1960's. I saw that episode at The Museum of Broadcasting a few years ago and it's the best ""Honeymooners"" episode ever. MPI please release that episode along with the 2 episodes done in 1962 with Sue Ann Langdon as Alice. This will please a very big ""Honeymooners"" fan.",1320364800,30,3442,4.736666666666666

Believe it or not both sides of our family have had personal interactions with Jackie Gleason. My dad worked at the Park Sheraton hotel for many years and used to run into Jackie all the time. He described Jackie as a regular guy who didn't let his fame spoil him. A real gentleman who treated everyone with respect.

My wife's grandfather was a tailor and Jackie was a regular customer (as was Tony Randall). He made a number of custom suits for Jackie.

The amount of material included in this set is breathtaking! I've been hoping for decades for a collection like this and now it's finally here. What a treat to see the very first Honeymooners sketch! And how about the musicals and all that bonus material?

4663723,5,B005E7SEOI,"Restored?  Well, not entirely.  Nevertheless, a great effort was made to create a worthy boxed set of Honeymooners material and this deserves a top rating.  This is the most complete 'Lost Episodes' collection ever (and perhaps to ever be) offered.  Of course, the series itself is not complete without the 'Classic 39' (not included here, but available separately), but for all else classic black and white Honeymooners, this is it.

Let's start from the beginning ...

This set includes the first Honeymooners skit (without Audrey Meadows, but with Art Carney as a police officer) from 5 October, 1951.  As a nice added touch, the original host introduction precedes it.  From this and other early skits, we witness the initial incarnations of some of television's most famous lines of dialog.  ""Don't steam me, Alice"" was there from the beginning, but ""'cause I'm already steamed"" would only be added in later routines.  ""One of these days, Alice"" was also not yet accompanied by ""Pow! Right in the kisser"".  The earliest surviving Joyce Randolph appearance (as Trixie) is in The Ring Salesman from 7 December 1951.  The earliest surviving Audrey Meadows (as Alice) can be found in The New Bowling Ball from 20 September 1952.  Both are also included in this impressive set.  The kiss at the end was there from the start, but the true magic between actors was yet to take shape.

This collection was pieced together into an impressive 15-DVD set.  And no double-sided discs, so that's a big plus.  The booklet is nice and colorful, giving you a brief bio, basic information about the skits, and features some nice images.  In fact, all skits appear to be listed, whether or not the films still exist.  For what no longer exists (or otherwise could not be found), a chronological placement and identification is included in the list along with the episodes found on the respective discs of this collection.

The content is as good as you would hope, tracing Honeymooners back to the very beginning and garnishing it with several special features of which many had not been seen since their original airing decades ago.  Beyond the obvious, you will find 1954 radio episodes, several interviews then and now, commercials, cast appearances on other shows, additional non-Gleason skits, and even Honeymooners scripts which were never filmed.  And in the case of Stand-In for Murder, in which the first airing had an aborted ending due to original TV time constraints, we get those few extras seconds not previously seen, as well as an explanation (of sorts) from Jackie Gleason about the intended ending and why it wasn't performed.  Furthermore, we have the option of seeing a complete re-working of the skit shot the following week.  This is a particular treat to see two versions of that particular skit.

The quality and restoration?  Certainly not much can be expected from these early days of television, so one must look at the previously-available material and compare.  From the previously unavailable works, some have audio anomalies such as a ringing noise and 'tin-can' sound.  In many cases, the source is likely as good as it gets.  In others, there certainly are improvements, but they're not always welcome.  At times, audio was de-hissed to the point where select spots are nearly lost and others are too loud.  To give an example, the video on Lucky Number has been greatly improved.  The image has been steadied and sharpened, the audio louder and clearer, but for some reason, it now has static.

The original Lost Episode collections were cheaply put together and disc space was not well utilized.  Twenty-four (24) discs were needed to complete the original MPI Lost Episodes collection.  Not the case with this new, 60th anniversary collection.  Each disc is loaded with material.  For example, the first disc includes nine (9) surviving Cavalcade of Stars (1951-52) Honeymooners skits and the first nine (9) from The Jackie Gleason Show (1952-53).

In total, there are 107 Honeymooners skits from various sources (1951-57) as well as dozens of other features both old and new.  Many sketches and full length shows are seen for the first time in over 5 decades.  As noted, everything outside of the 'Classic 39' filmed between 1951 and 1957 (which is known to exist) is included in this set.  Interestingly, several of the missing skits are available here in alternate aired versions which utilized the same script.  What you won't find is the premiere episode of Jackie Gleason: American Scene Magazine from 29 Sep, 1962 which features Gleason and Carney in an air raid shelter sketch entitled Two Below; a 10th anniversary Honeymooners special from another episode featuring Gleason and Carney revisiting their Dial J for Janitor sketch; and at least two others filmed in the early 1960s but believed lost forever.  Of the 1951-57 period, 21 known sketches which are believed to no longer exist are noted in the booklet.

A nice little bonus which will likely be welcomed by all is that once you place a disc in your player, it almost immediately goes to the main menu and is ready to play.  This feature was included in all but the first disc.

I used to watch Honeymooners every time I had a chance on NY's WPIX 11 back in the 1980s and 90s.  First at 11pm, then 11:30, midnight, 12:30 and so on until it nearly disappeared except for the 24-hour marathons a couple of times a year.  I copied and collected episodes from TV and enjoyed them until I was able to get the original 'Lost Episodes' on VHS, then DVD, and eventually, the 'Classic 39' on DVD (and now Blu-ray) as well.  I've viewed every skit from those sets many times over and memorized most of the dialog.  I was excited to hear about this 60th anniversary set but was skeptical about the level of restoration.

Though the improvements are not always obvious, the clear improvement for me is in the sheer breadth of this collection.  A welcome improvement to previous collections and so much more to enjoy and learn to love.  Perhaps there are some new favorite moments to experience.  No matter what, this is an impressive set and a worthy purchase for any and all interested in early television, Gleason, Carney, Meadows, Randolph, and of course, The Honeymooners.

I realize this was a rather long review, so I thank you kindly for reading.",1317859200,498,6332,4.883786316776008
4663724,5,B005E7SEOI,"I have watched just part of Disc 14 - enough information for this fan (who watched the Honeymooners on first telecasts in the 1950s) to give the package a *****.

I find that the June 1, 1957 sketch, Manager of a Baseball Team, looks beautiful for a kinescope...but besides the surprisingly good audio-video, we finally, finally have the final sketch from the '50s! (Needless to say, this episode was listed on three earlier packages which contained a *1953* rendition!).

I would have paid the full price for that historic episode on its' own, so my effusiveness can be understood!

There is very little material missing here...and both listed and nonlisted items are carefully notated. Hopefully, the apparent next-to-last sketch of May 11th, 1957 will be soon issued.

Another two sketches are not included: two 1962 efforts, from the American Scene Magazine, Gleason's return to weekly variety. Carney was back...but no Meadows or Randolph. This, plus the excellent 1966 remake of The Adoption, with Carney and Meadows.

For relatively new fans, I'll say that, generally speaking, you will not find ""Classic 39"" quality throughout any entry here - that season was done live on film, which benefitted the actors who could err and not worry that the error will be beamed out to the cosmos; the naturally, the writing and editing was exceptional. There are, shall we say, Classic *sketches* in this collection: i.e., Stars Over Flatbush, Peacemaker, Kramden vs. Norton, One Big Happy Family, Finders Keepers, Boys And Girls Together, etc.)

Also found herein is a new interview with Joyce Randolph (Trixie, 1952 to 1957); and old interviews with her TV ""husband"", Art Carney, in character, in various settings, including The Ed Sullivan Show.

Another featured extra is a group of Ed Norton ""Interviews"" from that final season. Gleason interviews Norton on current events, the most interesting the announced move by the Brooklyn Dodgers that they will soon be playing three-thousand miles away! The jokes are only mildly mildly funny but the full melancholy of the sports scenario hits a little closer to home: soon the Chauncey Street quartet will be joining the Ebbets Field, ""Sym-Phony"", as depressingly conspicuous by their absence, as well - Ralph, Alice, Norton, and Trixie would not return until 1962.

Ellen Burstyn fans, look out!! She's show briefly in the '57 shows as a ""Glea Girl""!

All political correctness aside, or should I say generational stereotyping aside, this show offered more than just laughs. We can watch a very underappreciated actor, Jackie Gleason, emote, and make the Charlie Sheens (all due respect) drop their heads. Yes, it sounds corny, but this show had ""heart"". Alice Kramden may have beeen the first TV feminist but her exasperation was couched in true love, respect, and understanding of her blue-collar guy. No effort, as today, to turn the tables on the dude who just doesn't get it.

So, take a row seat near the front, look at the drivers' rear view mirror, and let this collection, in tandem with The Classic 39 set (also on Amazon), take you right to the Moon!!!",1317772800,117,3108,5.029182879377432
4663725,5,B005E7SEOI,"As far as I'm concerned this is the DEFINITIVE Lost Episodes Collection!!! I previously shelled out BIG BUCKS for MPI's 6 individual Boxed Set releases of Lost Episodes as soon as I learned they went ""OUT-OF-PRINT""...and although I enjoyed those very much...as a long time HONEYMOONER fan I longed for a more ""COMPLETE"" collection of ""Lost Episodes"".

ALSO, DID I NEGLECT TO MENTION THAT THE EPISODES IN THIS SET ARE PRESENTED FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME (to my knowledge) IN THEIR ORIGINAL BROADCAST ORDER!!!  Very NEAT to see the evolution of the Cast and Characters into the iconic team we've all come to know and love throughout the years :) IN ORDER TO ASSEMBLE THIS MIGHTY SET...MPI HAS SPARED NO EXPENSE...INCLUDING HAVING THE MATERIAL COMPILED & RESTORED BY THE UCLA FILM & TELEVISION ARCHIVE...that being said, if your looking for PRISTINE BLU-RAY quality prints...look elsewhere...for we're talking about ""LIVE"" broadcasts from the golden age of television that in all honesty should not even exist were it not for ""kinescopes"" that were filmed off a live television monitor for airing in a different time zone!!! That said I can tell that they were lovingly restored as much as they could be compared to the previous boxed set releases...SO IF YOU ARE A ""TRUE"" HONEYMOONERS OR JACKIE GLEASON FAN...WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR...PICK UP THIS ""DEFINITIVE"" 60TH ANNIVERSARY SET WHILE YOU STILL CAN...ITS AS GOOD AS IT GETS GANG...NO DEFINITIVE BLU-RAY HI-DEF EDITION WILL EVER BE RELEASED FOR THIS RARE/SCARCE B&W MATERIAL...I ASSURE YOU!",1317772800,27,3855,5.576068376068376
4663726,5,B005E7SEOI,"I'm so excited about this collection. I love the Honeymooners, so this is gonna be such a treat to watch. This was real television, when it was fun to go home and relax and just enjoy. I would not want these to be colorized, that would just ruin the feel of the show. I can't believe how some people want things colorized. There's nothing wrong seeing things in there original black and white. So let's hope for more of these great shows on DVD.
Update: I've watched some episodes and they do sound And look better than the old MPI set. I've also noticed that the episode called  Alice plays Cupid  disc 2 on the 60th Anniversary collection the picture rolls 4 times and in the old MPI set that doesn't happen,so I wonder why that happened. But this is the best Honeymooners set you can buy. If your a true fan who doesn't care about colorization, this is in glorious black n White.
Update: another observation on disc 1 on the 60th Ann.edition an episode called (the new television set) with Pert Kelton in the role of Alice,the episode looks really bad and has lots of jumps in the begining. There was a special called The real lost episodes on television which aired on 6/12/94 on the Disney channel, that I have on tape and this episode is there, and it has no jumps and looks so much better than the one on the new MPI set. I don't know why they couldn't get a better copy of this episode. MPI is great, but I think they could have done just a bit better. But I really love this set. I've spent practically all day watching this great collection and it's really terrific.
Update: I've watched all the episodes in this collection. This is a great collection of honeymooners, I wish they could've done a better job with the sound and some episodes roll a few times. I have the old collection from MPI and I think the sound and picture is better. But this is still a wonderful collection to own.",1316476800,9,1897,4.371104815864022
4663727,5,B005E7SEOI,"I got a set of ""Lost Episodes"" a long time ago.  It's nice but does not have every episode, and contains a lot of commentary.  This set is supposed to be complete and restored, so I can't wait to get it.  As far as colorization, it would be nice but there is no way that is going to stop me from buying this set. I'm a true Honeymooners fan and this is a must have.-----UPDATE-----  I finally received my set and I love it!  Thanks to MPI Home Video and Jackie Gleason Enterprises for releasing this, and thanks to the UCLA Film & Television Archive for the restoration.  Excellent job!  [On a side note, I would like to know why Amazon had to pause selling this, what exactly are the complaints, because I can't find anything wrong with my set.]",1315440000,3,746,4.285714285714286

One of the discs I somehow misplaced/lost since the 90's along with 3 or 4 others so I said what the heck, 50 bucks, replace them.  Boy they did a great job of removing the horrible vertical film scratches from that episode in this newer set, watched the whole thing and I totally forgot about the flaws because they were... gone.  Was actually weird that when I popped it in I was thinking about those flaws and laughed thru the whole thing and it never occurred to me that the scratches were fixed until an hour later.

8467937,5,B005E7SEOI,"These should be broadcast today (alongside the Classic 39 episodes), because they're really pretty good. Ralph is portrayed slightly more belligerent, Alice is portrayed a little cruder at times, but Norton is just what you'd expect. :-) A lot of the story lines are recycled, in whole or in part; some are re-used in different seasons (for example, there are several variations on the same Christmas episode, a few years in a row), and some were adapted (again, in whole or in part) into some of the Classic 39 episodes. The video quality isn't great, but that's to be expected. It doesn't detract from the entertainment value and the humor.

If you're a Honeymooners fan, it's worth your while to check these out. Some great laughs.",1501632000,,734,4.825396825396825
