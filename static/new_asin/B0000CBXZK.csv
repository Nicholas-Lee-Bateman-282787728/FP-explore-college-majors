One was working fine. However, the other has scratches and the disc is not working properly. I was disappointed.",1242864000,,143,4.76

the arrangement of the bank manager and the manager's cast were both failed miserably; the final scene of the bank manager and the bank teller was also sucked big time; a twist came too embarrassingly stupid and simple, wrapped up very poorly. tom sizemore and sherilyn fenn both did a great job, if the screenplay could be tighter and faster, they might have turned out even greater. well, both actors now are aging, lost their great moment to be great. that's a shame, just like this movie.",1182124800,2,1041,4.693989071038251
