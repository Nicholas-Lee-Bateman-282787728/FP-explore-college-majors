8355523,3,B00282GZQ6,"I enjoyed the DVD, but after having also bought the Gunsmith of Williamsburg, this was no comparison.  In the Gunsmith DVD, there was a story line and steps were described to get a better understanding of what was done and why.  This did show nice information, but didn't have a lot of flow between scenes.  Would have liked to have seen more explanation of other tools that they used.  Nice video, but not nearly as good as the gunsmithing video from williamsburg.",1429920000,,465,4.634146341463414
8355524,5,B00282GZQ6,"My wife finds these videos boring but I think they are fascinating.  Reminds me of watching ""The New Yankee Workshop"" and ""The Woodwrights Shop"" when I was a kid.  Better, we watched these in a history class in college.  Entertaining AND you learn something.",1409875200,,258,4.818181818181818
8355525,5,B00282GZQ6,"My son had to do a blacksmith project for fifth grade, and I purchased this to help him get a first-hand view of what it would have been like to be a colonial blacksmith.  This film goes into great detail of how the work is done, what type of work, the processes, materials, etc.  There is even a complete beginning to end tutorial on making andirons for a fireplace.  Although I think it was made in the 1970s, it wasn't horrible quality and was easy to understand and interesting (for a young person).  A good reference item, not especially entertaining or thrilling.",1402358400,,569,4.549019607843137
8355526,5,B00282GZQ6,A very excellent how-to of blacksmithing.  He explains all he does and produces some very good pieces.  I enjoy how he explains even the feeling of feeling blah in the morning but his starting work at the forge revives him.,1399766400,,223,4.55
8355527,5,B00282GZQ6,"This is an extremely entertaining and informative video on blacksmithing during the colonial times, despite the original film being 30 years old. The narrator's voice is warm and friendly and his accent transports you back to the colonial days. You are submersed in Colonial Williamsburg's Culture and you gain an appreciation of the blacksmith not only as an integral part of keeping colonial society functioning, but also as an artist. Very impressive to watch--even for my 10, 8 and 3 year old sons!!! Wonderfully done!!!",1299196800,,524,5.176470588235294
