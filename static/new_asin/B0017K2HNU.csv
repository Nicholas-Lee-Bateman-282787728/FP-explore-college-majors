8266264,5,B0017K2HNU,"I have seen his movie on TV several times, and was always expecting to buy the CD. The story and screen adaptation are in perfect agreement, and the acting, by iconic Spanish actors, most of them unfortunately deceased, is nothing but superb. Although it is better to view it in its original Spanish.language, if you are an English speaker, the subtitles are accurate enough to convey the meaning and subtleties of the story, set in a period when prejudices, schemes and plots were the rule among the privileged upper crust (we haven't changed that much,have we?). In sum, the plot, acting, editing, cinematography and music; in combination with fabulous Spanish locations are a joy to view, many times over.",1362787200,,708,4.957983193277311

8266266,5,B0017K2HNU,"EL ABUELO (The Grandfather) began as a 1954 novel by Benito P&eacute;rez Gald&oacute;s and was adapted for the screen by writer/director Jos&eacute; Luis Garci in 1998, a year when it was nominated for Best Foreign Film Oscar. It is a period piece of epic proportions, an immensely beautiful work both visually and emotionally, that assures the film's becoming a beloved standard in the cinematic library.

Don Rodrigo de Arista Potestad (Fernando Fern&aacute;n G&oacute;mez, the brilliant Peruvian actor from such films as 'Butterfly', 'Belle Epoque', 'All About My Mother, etc) is a crusty old aristocrat who has been in America for the Gold Rush who returns to Spain (a small town of Jerusa) when his son dies. He concern is about a letter his son wrote to him that one of his two granddaughters was sired by another man, an artist, and the old man is determined to find out which one of the granddaughters should rightfully inherit is name and his money. He arrives to meet Dolly (Cristina Cruz) and Nelly (Cristina Cruz) and their beautiful mother Do&ntilde;a Lucrecia (Cayetana Guill&eacute;n Cuervo), a woman who has survived emotional hardships but has generously favored the small town with gifts while giving her daughters in home schooling by the intelligent, sensitive Don P&iacute;o Coronado (Rafael Alonso) who has been forsaken by his own family. The once butler of the home Sen&eacute;n Corchado (Agust&iacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez) has been freed to become an oily capitalist, eager to squander the family money.

Don Rodrigo (Abuelo) challenges the family to maintain the honor of his name, becomes fast friends with Don P&iacute;o, and the two set about to discover whether it is Dolly or Nelly that is the true bloodline granddaughter. The manner in which the investigation proceeds includes the warm relationship Abuelo forms with the girls, the way he decides the future of Lucrecia, and the bonding he forms with P&iacute;o. It is P&iacute;o who challenges Abuelo with the question of which is more important, honor or love, and it is this question that suffuses the resolution of the story with surprises and with extraordinary tenderness.

The actors are all superb with special kudos to Fernando Fern&aacute;n G&oacute;mez and Rafael Alonso. The cinematography of the coastlines of Spain is breathtakingly beautiful and the manner in which Ra&uacute;l P&eacute;rez Cubero frames his images glows. The original musical score is by Manuel Balboa whose love theme is hauntingly played by both piano and orchestra: the moments of music by Satie (Gymnop&eacute;die) and Elgar (the Nimrod variation from Enigma Variations) are beautifully performed by the Madrid Orchestra under the baton of &Aacute;ngel Gil Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez. The film is long (well over two hours) and there are some synchrony defects in the spoken soundtrack (?dubbing for the granddaughters' voices?), but these are minor flaws in an eloquently beautiful film. In Spanish with English subtitles. Grady Harp",1335139200,,2997,5.3052631578947365
8266267,5,B0017K2HNU,"Based on a Benito Perez Galdos' play, El abuelo (The grandfather) deals about the return to Spain of the Count Arbeit (Fernando Fernan Gomez in one of his most arresting performances of his succesful career)from USA trying to find a place into the great promise of the Big Dream without achieving less than nothing. He returnms to the village where his only family resides: his daughter in law and his lovable two grand daughters.

But there are powerful secrets that involve this family, concerning with the lost honor, the unfaithfulness and additionally the dramatic confrontations with the people of this village. Servility, envy, hypocrisy and the double moral are some of the showy virtues that label this community. A true wall of ingratitude and resentments that will maintain, nurture and accent still more the notable discrepancies.

Arresting images, sumptuous photography and the superb performances of Fernando Fernan Gomez and Agustin Gonzalez make of this film a true revelation finding and undoubtedly one of the films of the Nineties.

A true filmic gem!",1292976000,3,1071,5.215116279069767
