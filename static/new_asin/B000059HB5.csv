7933658,5,B000059HB5,"The video was shot at his concert in Knoxville, TN.  I bought the cd of the concert at his show in Branson, MO.  I really liked the cd.  Then when I put this dvd in and noticed it was the video, well, I got excited. No Jones fan will be unhappy at all.  Must have.",1009497600,2,264,3.7454545454545456
7933659,5,B000059HB5,"First let me tell you, when it comes to DVD's, concerts are what I live for(...). Anyway, this disc is what I look for, a great talent- sound 5.1- picture (not a fast moving camera that makes you puke) and bottom line... lots of fun! George is as country as they come, but being that so, he crosses the line to be a favorite amongst rock, folk, classical who ever, you can not deny this voice, persona and energy, wow the energy. This is a CONCERT, not a documentary; well it is but that is on the other half of the DVD after you watch the 118 minutes of pure uninterrupted concert! And yes, the documentary is really good, showing old concert, appearances and interviews. If you like George in the slightest, get this DVD, it is all that a concert DVD is supposed to be. Plus, you can get a laugh out of the Knoxville crowd, filmed in 1993. Just watch for George & the band, they click as good as this production. George, does that hair move?

7933660,5,B000059HB5,"What a disk!!!!  This must have been what they were trying to do when they made the Johnny Cash DVD. (man did they miss that one) Ole' Possom's DVD is the country disk I've been waiting for.  Very well done.  Excellent sound and picture.  Very interesting documentary.  Just wait till you see how far he went down from all the hard living.
I may watch this one again this weekend!!
Some of the best money spent on a DVD to date!!",990403200,12,429,4.246913580246914
7933661,5,B000059HB5,"The DVD comes in two parts, one containing a very interesting history of George Jones and the other a fantastic concert recorded in Knoxville, Tennesee.  The concert video and sound is great.  There are no interuptions as in some other country concert DVD's of any of the songs.  He even pokes fun of his no-show days with the song No-Show Jones.  He does plenty of hits and all sound perfect including the bone chilling ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"". Many of years have passed but his voice has not changed a bit.  I wish the DVD's of other older country stars that are starting to show up would use this same format. (I like to watch a biography once in a while but sometimes I am just in the mood for a downhome country concert without interruptions from a narrator).  Also look at the good side of this, even if George were to fall off the wagon, he could never be a no show in you living room.  Again, this one is worth the money.",987379200,12,935,4.308571428571429
