465489,3,6302464870,"""The Master of Ballantrae"" (1953) was an appropriate finale to Errol Flynn's 18-year career at Warner Brothers. Reunited with ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" co-director William Keighley, the aging star adds plenty of zest to this Robert Louis Stevenson adaptation. Jack Cardiff's on-location Technicolor photography is a tremendous asset. No classic, but far superior to the actor's latter-day vehicles.",1153094400,3,399,5.896551724137931
465490,4,6302464870,"Robert Louis Stevenson's swashbuckling tale is given the royal Hollywood treatment as Errol Flynn plays Ballantrae Castle's Jamie Durisdeer.  A courageous Highlander turned pirate to gain riches for his beloved home.  A costume adventure that leaps out at you with it's breathtaking color and rousing score.  Flynn is not as young here as he appeared in earlier outings such as, ""The Sea Hawk"" and ""Captain Blood,"" but he's as entertaining as ever and top notch in his sword fighting scenes.  Flynn is to wed his true love, however, his brother, played by Anthony Steel, is in love with her too.  As the story progresses, Flynn gets betrayed to the British, and believes it was his own brother that did it.  Beatrice Campbell and Yvonne Furneaux play Flynn's love interests.  Once again Warner Bros. has done an exceptional job transferring the film to dvd, it looks amazing.  I highly recommend this movie, as well as the ""Errol Flynn Signature Collection"" box set, which contains five great movies and a documentary of Flynn's career.  The swashbuckler's ""Captain Blood"" and ""The Sea Hawk"" are included here, plus a fine period piece, ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex,"" co-starring the legendary Bette Davis.  I also recommend the 1952 Stewart Granger adventure, ""Scaramouche,"" En garde!",1138060800,14,1298,5.109004739336493
465491,4,6302464870,"Errol Flynn was the master of swashbucklers and this one is a good example why. He slashes a swath through Scotland, down into the Caribean and back to Scotland again. The action takes place in the highlands, aboard pirate ships and in exotic parts. It involves love lost and lovers scorned. Brother is pitted against brother and treachery plays its part. It has all the elements and makes the most of them.

Flynn plays a Scottish noble. When the Jacobin rebellion reignites for the climax, the noble family hatches a plan for its own security. One son will fight for Bonnie Prince Charlie and the other will remain loyal to German George. That way, whichever way the rebellion goes, the family's title will remain safe. Flynn plays the elder, Jacobite son and his side loses. A personal betrayal makes the situation even more tenuous. Flynn has to flee the country for his life. The rest of the story concerns his ability to return to his love, and seek vengeance for his betrayal.

The action is pretty constant is this one and well done. The obligatory swooping around on available rigging, drapes etc. is present as is the swordplay. It's a winner.",1131580800,8,1153,4.731343283582089
465492,3,6302464870,"...And does a so-so job. The plot of ""Master of Ballantrae"" is somewhat similar to ""Captain Blood"" (our hero gets on the wrong side of a tyrant, escapes danger to live the life of a pirate, and returns home and/or to his one true love) but in comparing the two ""Ballantrae"" comes off the worse; Flynn looks his age and then some (although he still looks fabulous in tights, even if they are plaid), and his lady love (Beatrice Campbell) is certainly no Olivia de Havilland. On the plus side, Roger Livesey, as Col. Francis Burke, is a suitably entertaining sidekick. I couldn't get into the other characters enough to care what happened to them (the parts of the storyline without Flynn are only average at best), but it's always fun to watch Errol swashbuckling away.",1096416000,8,768,4.654411764705882
465493,3,6302464870,"This is an interesting film as it has always gained mixed opinions.  For fans of Errol Flynn it is a highly regarded late career film.  Certainly it is the best (and most widely available) of his 1950's swashbuckler movies.  Although his looks had matured by the time he reached his mid forties (he was 43 when this movie made filmed in late 1952) Flynn still looked good in costume and was still agile enough to indulge in some well staged swordfights.
However, although this film is highly regarded by Flynn fans, it is not by general reviewers.  I think this is because they are reviewing the film as a adaption of a famous novel, and in that sense, the film is a let down.
However, it is still a colourful swashbuckler from the 1950's and the last to show off Flynn to good advantage and give him a 'meaty' role.",1069545600,34,816,4.42
465494,4,6302464870,"This late Flynn classic deserves better attention.  The film moves at a rollicking pace, taking us from Bonnie Prince Charlie's abortive '45 rising to assorted adventures abroad and back home again.  Flynn is convincing as a Highland gent who throws his lot in with the Stewart cause, more out of a sense of adventure than anything else one suspects.  The film also shows how many great Highland families hedged their bets by having brothers fight on both sides of what was essentially a mini-civil war between the clans and the Anglo-Hanoverians.  After the disaster  at Culloden, Flynn and his Irish side-kick in French service, Roger Livesey, must flee the Highlands or face the Duke of Cumberland's justice!  Teaming Livesey and Flynn together makes for a most interesting pair, as both are still swashbuckling after their prime.  Livesey was more of a British stage actor type than Flynn, and not as much a Hollywood protege.  Still, they work well together as they seek adventure abroad before returning home again some years later to settle old scores.  Lots of pirate action here as well.
The final sword battle where Flynn takes on the entire visiting Hanoverian officer corps at the castle is typical of his old  glory days.  Shades of ""Robin Hood"" for sure!  For a 1950s movie we have many of the old classic elements.  Action, adventure, romance, betrayal, pirates and loyalty all get their full play in a lush production of beautiful color and fine sets.  Flynn still has something even with all the failings of health that are
soon to overtake him.  A late Errol Flynn action classic for sure, with some attempt at history thrown in!  Good to see again in DVD even if it looks about the same as the VHS version still around.  Fine for Flynn fans and those who like colorful, action epics.",1063843200,21,1802,4.798701298701299
465495,4,6302464870,"""The Master of Ballantrae"" is a very entertaining historical adventure, with the greatest swordsman in filmdom, Errol Flynn.
I certainly did not buy this DVD because I expected an 89-minute film to be faithful to the Stevenson novel. I wanted fun and adventure with one of my favourite stars, and I wasn't disappointed.
At the same time, this is not Flynn ""at his peak""--for that, wait until the end of September when Warner Bros. release ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" ( with hopefully ""Captain Blood"" and ""The Sea Hawk"" in the not-too-distant future ! ). By the 1950s, Errol's ""wicked, wicked ways"" had taken their toll. In ""Master"", he is visibly older and heavier--but--it's still Errol Flynn ! He still exudes star quality--charisma--immense charm. As an actor, he has several intense scenes and certainly holds his own with a solid British cast.
The plot moves quickly--Bonnie Prince Charlie is back--the Scots battle the English, with Flynn on the Scottish side--Scottish dreams die with many men on the battlefield--our hero must flee Scotland before he is arrested and hanged, but not before an apparent betrayal by his own brother ( Anthony Steel )--escape to the Caribbean and adventures with pirates--return to Scotland for the woman he loves, and to settle old scores.
Jack Cardiff's colour photography is a big plus, especially on-location scenes in the beautiful Scottish highlands. While Flynn commands our attention, let's not forget a strong supporting cast. Roger Livesey acquits himself well in an atypical role, as Flynn's roguish, Irish sidekick. Anthony Steel is fine as Flynn's brother--he was a popular star in Britain in the 1950s, and with his looks ( a bit like Mel Gibson ), it's surprising that he did not become even more famous. There is one casting weakness--Beatrice Campbell, as Flynn's ""true love"" doesn't register at all--that Flynn's character would go through so much trouble to ""reclaim"" her, stretches credulity more than a little.
As far as ""late"" Flynn films go, this is likely the best--mix in some injustice, a nasty villain or two, and give Errol a sword--what more do you want ?
The DVD is nice--the colours are pretty decent for a 50-year old film, with some haziness here and there--the sound is mono--a few extras include shots from the film, the cast ( no details ),and four Flynn trailers.
If you like old, classic adventure films, this is a good one--try it !",1059350400,79,2412,4.987593052109181
465496,4,6302464870,"Upon its release, ""The Master of Ballentrae"" was considered a massive undertaking and huge gamble on the part of Warner Brothers Studio. Their star, Errol Flynn's lavishly perverse lifestyle had caught up to him in such a way as to prevent any close up photography except for some occasional snippets shot through a thick filter.  Shot in Italy, Scottland and Wales the resulting film was a huge hit in Europe but a widely regarded dud in the U.S.  Set aside the title if you're a fan of the Robert Louis Stevenson novel because this movie in no way follows any part of the original book's plot.  As a stand alone film however, it is a rather inviting piece of confection with Flynn doing his swordplay and slick one liners on lavish sets and with the brilliant photography of Jack Cardiff much to his benefit.
Warner Home Video gives us a nice looking DVD transfer of this would be masterpiece.  Edge enhancement does crop up now and then but nothing that will terribly distract one from enjoying the film.  Colors are rich and nicely balanced.  Blacks are deep.  Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum.  Over all, a clean visual presentation.  The audio is mono but very well balanced and nicely restored.
EXTRAS: a photo gallery and some other toss away stuff.
BOTTOM LINE: This is an Errol Flynn movie - perhaps ""the"" Errol Flynn movie of the 1950's.  It's overblown handling of the subject matter is in tune with the 1950's need for bigger entertainment.  But at 89 min. and minus the author's original intent, I only recommend this movie to die hard Flynn fans.  But hey, Warner Brothers - how about giving us a few of Errol's truly memorable classics on DVD - ""Charge of the Light Brigade"", ""Dodge City"", ""Captain Blood"" and ""They Died With Their Boots On"" come to mind.",1057795200,12,1782,4.640127388535032
465497,4,6302464870,"Master of Ballantrae is absolutely the best Flynn of the 50's. The script, score and color cinematography are first rate but the main asset is Flynn. He really shows up in this one. He proves, probably for the last time, why  he was such a big star. Also, its a good buddy picture with a funny Irish  actor (can't remember the name)playing the  Alan Hale role. There are some  fabulous locations and a couple of solid villians to round things out.  Another asset is the use of real sailing ships. There are very few process  shots or back projection garbage in this one. If you're a Flynn fan and  you've missed this one check it out.

465800,4,6302464870,"For more than a dozen years he was one of Hollywood's brightest stars, both on and off the screen. His name alone was enough to make women swoon, and it soon became an expression itself. He was the true descendent of the Douglas Fairbanks tradition of swashbuckling, and truth be told, no one since filled the bill as well as he. He was Errol Flynn, and while his  best days were behind him - Captain Blood (1935), Major Vickers (1936), Robin Hood (1938), the Earl of Essex (1939), and George Armstrong Custer (1941) - were done and gone, here in 1953 we still see the signs of his charm, the wicked smile, and some hints of his great physical prowess. True, he has the bulge of a small pouch, and his steps are not so quick, and his tired face has lost the tautness of his younger years. Still, here he is, in all his present and former glory, once again unto the breech as a swashbuckler in the ""Master of Ballantrae"", a 1953 Technicolor film from Warner Brothers, based on the 1889 Robert Louis Stevenson novel.

Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-94) was one of the greatest writers of all time, and his novels have been made into films dozens of times. The best screen adaptations of his works include ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1920 with John Barrymore, 1931 with Frederic March) and ""Treasure Island"" (1934 with Wallace Beery and 1950 with Robert Newton).

""Master of Ballantrae"" has a cast of mostly unknown (to U.S. audiences actors with the exception of Felix Aylmer (1889-1979) who plays Flynn's father. Of his 150+ films, Aylmer is best known for his roles as Polonius in Olivier's ""Hamlet"" (1948) and as the Archbishop of Canterbury from ""Becket"" (1964).

This was the last film for director William Keighley (1889-1984) who worked with Flynn on ""The Prince and the Pauper"" (1937) and ""Robin Hood"" (1938). Although he never won any major awards, Keighley directed such memorable films as ""The Man who came to Dinner"" (1942), ""G Men"" (1935), and ""The Green Pastures"" (1936).

Variety called it ""tailor made"" for Flynn and The NY Times called it ""a rousing, spectacular outlet"" and said ""Mr. Flynn is, in turn, bold, roguish and forgiveably self-satisfied in his best swashbuckler since ""The Sea Hawk,"" thirteen long years ago.""

Bottom line - an old fashioned swashbuckler which is a little past its prime, along with the star, but it's Errol Flynn so who cares about the details.",1343001600,,2386,4.7235576923076925
465801,3,6302464870,Last of the action picture made by Errol Flynn.  I have read a few comments about this film which I saw as a child a long time ago.  But I still like it asm Errol Flynn regardless of his private life is someone especial on the screen.,1335139200,,234,3.9574468085106385
465802,3,6302464870,"The Master of Ballantrae may bear only a passing resemblance to Robert Louis Stevenson's novel (so much so that the British prints stressed that it was `an adaptation' in the very opening credit while in France they changed the title to The Vagabond of the Seas) but it's still Errol Flynn's last good adventure story even if he was showing more than a little wear and tear from his wicked ways and is rather noticeably doubled in his big swordfight. Reunited for the last time with [I]Robin Hood[/I] co-director William Keighley (working on his last film), there's still just enough of the old magic showing to carry him through a swashbuckler he would probably have been getting a bit too old for even if he'd taken better care of his liver, though he was a good enough actor to have carried a more faithful adaptation - in the novel his character is a far darker and more villainously deceptive prodigal son than he gets to play here in what uses Stevenson's starting point (a toss of the coin deciding which brother will fight for Bonnie Prince Charlie and which will stay at home feigning loyalty to the English crown to preserve the family estate) to carry him through a brisk rerun of the pirate episodes of Captain Blood. He even gets to ally and fall out with another dapper French buccaneer (Jacques Berthier) before returning home to settle the score with Anthony Steel's bland younger brother he wrongly believes betrayed him and carry off the girl who thinks he's dead. At less than an hour-and-a-half it moves at a brisk pace even if it's hero is a little slower and there's a noticeable lack of a strong villain, though the narration can be a bit jarring, especially since half of it isn't really necessary. Roger Livesey shows willing in what once would have been the Alan Hale role as his Irish sidekick, while Jack Cardiff's Technicolor photography is gorgeously vivid. Not a classic to rival his best, but not a bad way for Flynn to end his Warner Bros. years at all.

Warners' US NTSC DVD has a decent selection of extras - stills gallery, trailer and trailers for The Adventures of Robin Hood, Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk.",1332806400,4,2146,4.647368421052631
