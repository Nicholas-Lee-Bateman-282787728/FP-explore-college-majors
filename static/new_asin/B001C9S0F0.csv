3506820,2,B001C9S0F0,Its been said here - the quality is poor due to 5-6 episodes rammed onto double sided discs.,1232409600,2,92,4.166666666666667
3506821,5,B001C9S0F0,"I am a true ""Dallas"" fan, one who harkens back to the days of Jim Davis as Jock.  For the last 22 years I have wrestled with the notion of the 1986-87 season as one of the best, if not the best season of the show. After purchasing and viewing the first episodes of season 10, I have finally concluded that the 1986-87 season is the very best season and here's why. 1) The Wes Parmalee storyline is one of the most intriguing that the series ever introduced.  Most intelligent viewers then and now understood that what suspended this storyline and made it exciting was not whether Wes Parmalee was Jock, but whether Wes Parmalee would be able to convince others that he was.  Because of the circumstances surrounding Jock's death, and because his body was never found, the premise of this storyline was quite viable. 2) The Valentine Lingerie storyline is absolutely titillating. For years JR. had engaged in sex with other women, humilating Sue Ellen. In the previous season, Sue Ellen had pulled herself up and had become a successful fundraiser for Mark Graison's foundation.  However, in the 1986-87 season, Sue Ellen uses sex not only to become successful in her own right, but to exact the perfect vengenance on JR by using the sex industry to demean his latest mistress and consequently defuse JR's interest in her.  3) Take these two brilliant storylines and combine them with the reunion of Bobby & Pam (what many viewers wanted for years), along with JR's hiring of mercenary, B.D. Calhoun to bomb oil fields in the Middle East, and you have the ingredients of a season filled with emotion, psychology, and good ol' fashioned ""two-fisted action"".  Furthermore, the show's writers resisted the temptation to drag-out storylines, and by midseason all of these stories were concluded. Unfortunately, the second half of the season is not nearly as riveting as the first, but the power-packed first half more than makes up for the less imaginative conclusion to the greatest season of television's greatest show.",1232064000,,2016,4.880116959064328
3506822,2,B001C9S0F0,"Crappy video....and who designed the DVD disc box....the #2 and #3 discs allready have scratches on them and I could hear them scratching each other while taking off the plastic wrapper.....when you buy it you'll know what I mean.

I've been looking forward to 10th season more then any other....too bad there more interested in saving money then putting out a quality product.

I give it 2 stars only because this was my favorite Dallas season but am completely disappointed with the video quality and how the disc box was designed.",1231977600,2,533,4.846153846153846
3506823,1,B001C9S0F0,"Let me first say, I LOVE this series. It is my favorite show ever. My low score of this review has nothing to do with the series, and everything to do with the penny-pinching way Warner Bros. is starting to put these DVD sets out. When they first started releasing this series they actually did a great job, spreading the episodes out across double the amount of discs they do now. Starting with Season 9, however, they started squeezing more episodes onto the discs. The trade-off has been a less and less clearer picture. Think I'm joking? Pop in a disc from the first few seasons and compare the picture quality to the that of Season 9 or 10. You will see a noticeable difference both in picture and audio. The reason, in order to fit more shows onto one disc they have to compress the information (squeeze it, in a matter of words) in order to make it fit. It's like watching a VHS that's been recorded at SLP and one at EP.
 Season 10 is by far the worse. They have forced 5 episodes onto a single side of a disc. That's nearly 5 hours. And as a result the picture is fuzzy as hell and the opening credits are jagged and flicker. It's unbelieveable Warner Bros. would give such shoddy treatment to a series that made ungodly amounts of money. The only bright side is they didn't start doing this until last season when most of the series has already been released.

 Who knows, maybe the next season they release they'll find a way to squeeze the whole thing onto one disc. They can always edit the episodes down into Cliff-note 1/2-hour versions.",1231891200,2,1552,4.419580419580419
3506824,5,B001C9S0F0,I have all of the other seasons. Can't wait for this one to come out. This one was of the best shows on TV. Larry Hagman as JR was one in a million.,1230595200,,148,3.515151515151515
3506825,5,B001C9S0F0,"This year opened with the ""jump the shark"" moment of all time: Bobby is revived from death by means of what we would learn was a year-long dream...

The world moaned. And no one could believe the biggest drama show in TV history had stooped to such lazy, self-destructive tactics... ""Pam's Dream"" quickly became a sitcom punchline for ages.

As weak as the previous season's plotting had admittedly been, the new season (with the old producers also returning) could have gotten on track with its new storylines almost as quickly if another, less-insulting explanation had been provided for Bobby's return--- but no such luck.

That said, this would turn out to be one of the four most entertaining seasons in DALLAS history (and arguably the last great one), what with patriarch Jock ALSO possibly returning from the dead, Bobby and Pam re-marrying, Jenna preggers and furious, Sue Ellen finally learning to dish-out to JR the kind of crap he'd given her for so long, JR's little war in the middle east...

And it's all done with such intrigue and more humor than we'd ever gotten before from DALLAS (and quite unlike the awful GREEN ACRES style camp the show would soon be handing us in subsequent years).

This is a great year for DALLAS; afterwards, it all starts to fall apart cartoon-style.",1223856000,,1295,4.815315315315315
3506826,5,B001C9S0F0,"This 1986-1987 dallas season was THE LAST season in which all original cast members were present in the post jim davis era excluding charlene tilton who came back the next year of the show.
 With bobby's return from ""the dead"" the show came back to reality with the bobby-pam-jenna triangle and with JR'S scemes as usual.
 Remember this was the last season for pam and donna who were never to return after this season.
 Ray and jenna would leave after the end of the next season and sue ellen left after season 12 so this season is the beginning of the end for the golden era of the show as it was the last who had all original cast members and the last which remained in neilsen's top 10 (almost as it was in #11).
 Let's hope that the new dallas 2008 reunion will be featured in the future dallas season releases and until then we can find out what happened after pam woke up and saw bobby's ""ghost"" in her shower...",1222646400,3,918,4.319767441860465
3506827,5,B001C9S0F0,"Great to see them pick up from season 8 after the dream season 9, interesting to see tis idea carried to fruition. Good season to watch in all respects. Alot of people don't like the later seasons but I love the whole series. A shame they crammed so many episodes on to each disc as a money saving method as the picture quality is weak.

3506828,5,B001C9S0F0,"This is one of my absolute favorite seasons of the show.  To me actually, this is where the real show begins-I'm a tremendous fan of the later years and these are the releases I have really been waiting for.  With Patrick Duffy back, and Dack Rambo in the main title, and also starring Steve Forrest, Deborah Shelton, Jenilee Harrison, and Sheree J Wilson, this season is of course infamous for returning the show to ""reality"" by making the last year a dream.  However, with Leonard Katzman and David Paulsen back in charge of the show, the real Dallas came back after the disappointing and weak year without Bobby.  There is excitement, intrigue related to the oil business, bad behavior, reunions and breakups that had been waiting to happen, and huge epic events for the show as a whole.  Just in general it is the show at it's best, with yet another classic cliffhanger.",1221868800,19,874,4.686274509803922

3506858,2,B001C9S0F0,"For me this is where Dallas takes a turn,  a turn for the worse . I agree that the picture quality was poor , and it seem the show lost its glamour.  Season 10 to 14 are in my opinion just not good not good writing not good directing.  The only part of season 10 was Sue Ellen new found power, self worth and self respect.  What I didn't like was Weas as Jockey,  Ray and Doncaster Brake up , and him with Jenna. Bobby and Pam although I'm a fan this season with them was a snoozer . I prefer season 4 through 9 , and unlike most other my favorite seadon was seadon 9 the dream ...",1444089600,,581,3.8487394957983194

I am halfway through the first episode and I have noticed that either the background music and sound effects are too high in the mix, or the voices are mixed too low. Sometimes I can barely hear what anyone is saying when the music is playing, because the music is drowning it out. And in one scene, Bobby and Pam are outside and the sound effects from the bugs or whatever are as loud as their voices. This wasn't a problem in any of the other seasons. I am hoping every episode of this season is not going to be like this.",1431302400,,602,4.110169491525424

3506868,4,B001C9S0F0,"The beginning of this season is when they get it back to 'reality'. Bobby is alive,a nd season 9 is basically erased, as a dream of Pam's. So Jamie and Sue Ellen aren't dead from the explosion of the Ewing building in the season 9 finale 'Blast From The Past' and everything else that happened, didn't really happen..I actually think season 9 is one of the best seasons of the series. I have seen quite a few reviews stating otherwise, for me anyway, i thought it had way more excitement, than the typical wheeling and dealing oil companies, and bed hopping storylines that almost made up the whole show seasons 2-8. Not to spoil anything for anyone, but another thing that didn't actually happen, in season 9 (dream season) Cliff tells Jamie that he actually has fallen in love with her, even though in season 8, he originally just married her to get some of her Ewing shares. So we see a love story for them, and i thought Jamie was perfect for him, i liked Afton (left first ep of season 8, later returned shortly in season 12) In a way, they replaced her with Jamie. I think Jamie is one of the most likeable characters ever to be on the show, I wish they kept her on until then end. Unfortunately she is gone 15 episodes in to this season. Mandy Winger plays a really prominent role in this season. I think the most exciting plot in this season, was Sue Ellen buying out a lingerie company, and making it her own. Using J.R's mistress, Mandy Winger as the main model for her lingerie business. Sue Ellen for once wasn't a victim and finally stands up to J.R. She didn't get drunk, at all actually. And she actually started to have the upper hand. Probably the main story in this season was J.R's illegal deals with a man named B.D Calhoun, i didn't think this storyline was the greatest, but had some suspense. I think the Wes Parmalee storyline was really dumb. A man shows up to be a ranch hand for Southfork, Wes Parmalee, played by Steve Forrest, Claims to be Jock Ewing. His story is that he never really died in the plane crash in South America (see season 5) but barely survived, and underwent a lot of reconstructive surgery and that's also why his voice is different. The Ewing's are of course enraged by his claims, eventually Miss Ellie almost starts feeling like it could be true, Which causes a riff between her and her second husband Clayton (Howard Keel).  He knows all sorts of private things about the Ewing's, that only Jock could have known, well it turns out he was a fake all along and then he leaves. Stupid storyline in my opinion, and it just ended out of nowhere, it was pointless and crazy. also Jack Ewing, kind of disappeared  i know they had an exit for him, but i really don't remember how he left. Jack's ex wife April Stevens comes to Dallas. Played by Sheree J Wilson. she is nothing but money hungry at first. I didn't really like her this season. Eventually she becomes likeable. I enjoyed Jenna Wade (Priscilla Presley) this season, along with her daughter, This season shows her and Ray's romance starting and his ending with his wife Donna (Susan Howard) i thought the three of them gave excellent performances. and I've heard people say Priscilla wasn't good on this show, i thought she was . Overall this season is good, not one of the best though, But the point of this series is to see it all in order, if not, you will be very confused.",1426291200,3,3384,4.447665056360709

3506887,5,B001C9S0F0,"After the (very awkward) one sentence explanation of the previous season and the final 10-15 minutes of Season VIII being a dream, DALLAS kicks things off into higher gear. Once I wrapped my head around the fact that Bobby's death never really occurred and the entire aftermath was a horrible dream (I wish that Donna losing her baby with Down's Syndrome and subsequently taking care of special needs children hadn't been part of it), I was able to enjoy Season 10.

Season 10 kicks off with a II-part premiere in which J.R. pulls a stunt that causes Cliff considerable pain, and that ranks as one of the series' finest moments, in my opinion. That is merely the tip of the iceberg, my friends. And how would DALLAS celebrate a decade of powling, gassing, fighting, ribbing and good old-fashioned family fun? Why, with kidnappings, murders, intrigues, death threats and even more fighting, of course.

It was heartwarming and the happiest I'd ever seen them together.  Season 10 made them seem like they never care for each other.  The rest was just bad. Got rid of Jamie and Jack Ewing.  Made Cliff Barnes look like a buffoon.  It was painful to continue watching each episode, but I did because I already purchased it.  The worst...Jenna being pregnant with Bobby's child and deciding to not acknowledge the fact. That should have been a dream sequence. Bad on every episode.

Donna, still a useless character on the show, is pregnant and working with lobbyists in Washington to get a Tariff to raise the price of oil for the Arabs.

Ray and Donna are not doing well as a couple so Ray, with his new house, has set his sights on Jenna Wade.

Jenna is distant and crazy and pregnant.  Charlie is fast and loose and defiant.

Pam and Bobby are back together and Pam is again boring and serves no purpose on the show.

Ms. Ellie and Clayton are a boring couple as usual.

Wes Parmalee claims to be Jock and is the best character on the show.  If Parmalee was a little taller and forceful, he would be a believeable Jock.

Cliff is treating Jamie horribly and is impotent.

Mandy Winger is trying to get JR to marry her, but JR can't get rid of SueEllen.

The above synopsis is for the first half of the season.

The last half of the season saw the following changes and/or storylines:

Sexism - Larry Hagman, upset that the women got leading storylines in Season 9, demanded that women never be showcased again.  As a result, this season is very belittling and insulting to women.  I have said before that I would not watch any more seasons of Dallas.  This time, I am going to keep my word.  The show jumped the shark years ago.  My decision to watch it as an adult was a form of self reflection.  Dallas was a good show, but a very flawed show.  Anyway, back to the sexism.  Cliff made a lot of belitting remarks about women.  JR even asked Sueellen ""why would I want to watch a bunch of hens talking?"" There were several instances where women were referred to as stupid and lacking in intelligence

Diversity - Dormae, the black hostess, said a few more words this season; though the character started dressing much older.  The CIA agent was black.  The CIA's assistant was black.  The CIA agent even told JR, your a**zz is grass and the Justice Department is the lawn mower.  In spite of these changes, it still was obvious that the Ewings and Barnes had no contact with black people

Ray and Donna  - Donna moves to Washington and basically cuts Ray out of his own child's life.  I found this action on the part of the writers to be despicable.  Ray never had a real family and now that he has one, the writers take it away from him

Ray/Jenna/and Charlie - Ray needs a family so he and Jenna hook up and are going to end up raising Bobby Ewing's baby with Jenna.

Pam and Bobby - happily married and Pam now can carry a baby to term; Pam, talking on the phone in the car, ends up hitting a tractor trailor and her car blows up

JR and Sue Ellen  - they are in love again; SueEllen brings Mandy back to test JR's love for her but JR is too busy being prosecuted by the Justice Department to pay much attention to Mandy

Terrorist activity - JR hires BD Calhoun to blow up some Saudi oil fields; JR gets scared and goes to the CIA; BD finds out and drugs SueEllen and remove her clothes and pose her for photos; BD also kidnaps John Ross; JR and Bobby and Ray end up shooting BD Calhoun; JR is shot in the process

SueEllen is almost raped - BD Calhoun drugs SueEllen and removes her clothes and poses her for pictures.  The show assures the audience SueEllen was not raped.  It, however, made no sense that SueEllen did not go to a doctor and make sure

Cliff/Jack/Jamie - Jamie dies and Cliff ends up with 10% of Ewing oil; after a hearing April Stevens ends up with 5% of Ewing Oil and Cliff ends up with 5%; Jack leaves town in disgust

Ellie and Clayton - they do puzzles and play Backgammon a lot

In the end, the Ewings lose Ewing Oil and the building; Jeremy Windell ends up with the building and the last scene is JR walking out with the photo of Jock and telling his son: THIS IS EWING OIL.

That last scene should have been the SERIES FINALE of the show; there literally was no where else for the show to go from there.  I read the summaries of the last 4 seasons and the show was a shadow of its former self. It is sad, but Season 10 is it from me now and was for me then.",1395619200,,4234,4.211442786069652

3506910,4,B001C9S0F0,"Thank god for The Valentine Girl because Wes Parmalee as the return of Jock Ewing was outlandishly far fetched. Steve Forest might have made a very decent replacement after Jim Davis passed away, but the writers and producers of the show must have been excessively concerned that Howard Keel had become too one dimensional as Clayton Farlow to have even attempted to bring Jock Ewing back from the dead under such ridiculous pretenses. The remorse they may have had over not finding Steve Forest to play Jock Ewing a few seasons back, before focusing on Clayton Farlow cost this season some major plausibility in my opinion.

  I'm a big fan of the show and have always enjoyed Ken Kercheval as Cliff Barnes but it seems obvious to me that he may have been indulging in cocaine or some other kind of narcotic this season. Cliff is always ill focused and somewhat clueless to the world around him, but this season it went deeper. He seemed detached and unfocused on simply 'Being' Cliff Barnes and his chemistry with co stars in his scenes was noticeably affected.

  Jenna Wade's miserable daughter Charly is my comic relief of the season...She thinks Mom has blown their one chance at the good life and she makes no bones about it. She spends the season smarting off and sulking in her true colors, a shameless spoiled brat who thought she was gonna be 'all set' as soon as Mom marries a Ewing. It's amusing to watch the blatant resentment seething from a girl whom we had only known for smiles and sunshine when everything was going the way she had hoped.

  I noticed a grainier, washed out, 'look' to this season just as others have...everyone looks a little chalky and frizzy, (JR's worst hair season of all-lol)! I tend to think its more likely the result of the lighting trends that were suitable for the technology available at that time, rather than a flaw of the film quality.",1357084800,,1886,4.656626506024097

3506913,4,B001C9S0F0,"**NOTE- This review contains spoilers**

Who would have thought that so deep in its run, and after the off-the-rails fiasco of the ""dream season"", ""Dallas"" could bounce back so quickly with one of its best seasons ever?

After Patrick Duffy agreed to return to the show as Bobby Ewing in the second most-famous shower scene in history (behind ""Psycho""), the writers had their work cut out for them in how to explain away the events of the previous season. This makes for some awkwardness in the storylines as the writers are forced to do some serious backtracking to get the plots rolling again. This gives the early episodes a strange sense of deja vu.

Pam and Bobby remarry but not before Ray blurts out that Jenna is pregnant with Bobby's child. Jenna comes off as especially bitter and angry this season, but Priscilla Presley delivers her best performance on ""Dallas"" during the scene when Pam offers to adopt the unborn baby.

Steve Forrest's original character Ben Stivers had to be re-written, because you don't just fire an actor like Steve Forrest. So now he's Wes Parmalee, who still has a mysterious interest in Miss Ellie--for good reason. It seems Wes is the reincarnation of the late Jock Ewing, which has Miss Ellie questioning her own sanity and culminates in a great showdown between Wes and Clayton (Howard Keel). Naturally J.R. is suspicious of Wes but it's Bobby who comes off incredibly hostile. Later, there's another great fight; this one between J.R. and Clayton.

Mrs. Krebbs Goes to Washington: Donna (Susan Howard) is still pregnant, but the baby no longer has Down's Syndrome. Howard looks positively radiant without makeup in the hospital scene after she's given birth to a baby girl. Her decision to get back into politics puts the nail in the coffin to her marriage so Ray hooks up with Jenna and she and daughter Charlie (who's now a defiant teenage party girl who hangs out with bikers) move in with him.

Sue Ellen secretly purchases a trashy lingerie franchise and makes Mandy Winger (Deborah Shelton) the face of Valentine Lingerie. The ""pornographic"" ads serve their purpose when they turn J.R. off Mandy for good and her clever scheme earns Sue Ellen his respect. Deborah Shelton really ups her game this season and delivers her best work on the series.

Jamie (Jenilee Harrison) looks stunning this season but she and Cliff divorce because he can't seem to help treating her badly. Later, Sue Ellen gets the phone call that Jamie has died offscreen in a hiking accident.

Shelton and Harrison depart ""Dallas"" in the same episode and Sheree J. Wilson debuts this season to fill the void (and move into Mandy's condo). Wilson plays April Stevens, ex-wife of Jack Ewing (Dack Rambo), who uses her kittenish, sly feminine wiles to play both J.R. AND Jeremy Wendell to get whatever she wants.

J.R. toys with the idea of bombing oil fields in the Middle East and hooks up with crazy mercenary B.D. Calhoun, but when things get too heated, J.R. sells him out to the Feds--an act that has serious consequences when B.D. retaliates by kidnapping John-Ross and luring J.R. to an amusement park for a showdown. It's all too over-the-top for it's own good, even for ""Dallas"". Jeremy Wendell blows the whistle on the whole scheme and the CIA catch up with J.R. for his actions which results in a huge scandal for Ewing Oil. This allows Wendell to finally be able to purchase the company.

The season ends with the surprise return of Katherine (Morgan Brittany) and the heartwarming news that Pam will finally be able to conceive a baby and carry it to full-term. That is, until the explosive season-finale!

Episode 13 of the season does appear time-compressed with everyone speaking in high-pitched voices.

A huge improvement over the dreadful ""dream season"" and being the last season with Victoria Principal, really the end of an era for ""Dallas"".

3506916,3,B001C9S0F0,"After watching season 10 of ""Dallas"", I realized a couple of things. First of all, the picture quality is disappointing compared to the earlier seasons. It almost looks like VCR-quality picture at times. Secondly, it is a nice comeback season after the horrible 9th season which turned out to be a dream. Thirdly, while it is enjoyable, it is generally uneven and does not capture the magic of the terrific earlier seasons (seasons 3 through 7).

Some of the major storylines during the season include J.R.'s secret dealings with a terrorist, the return of Jock Ewing in the body of Wes Parmalee, Sue Ellen's master plan to get even with J.R., the whole Bobby/Jenna/Pam/Ray/Donna love triangle, and the whole Cliff/April/Jamie/Jack connection.

First let's start with the best storyline: J.R.'s dealings with a terrorist. With the American oil industry struggling, J.R. secretly comes up with an idea to hire a mercenary to blow up oil fields in Saudi Arabia to help increase the price of oil. With each subsequent episode, J.R. seems to get in deeper and deeper. Eventually it reaches a point where people lives are on the line and J.R.'s money cannot get him out of this situation. You begin to realize that J.R. has really stepped over the line this time. This is more than the blackmailing of a top official.  People's lives are seriously put at stake here. However, J.R., true to form, explains it to the family as if he was an innocent bystander sucked into a terrorist's plot and then had the courage to blow the whistle. This storyline and its aftermath ran the bulk of the season and ultimately brought major changes going into season 11. It made for great drama, as you knew that the terrorist was dangerous and you waited for his next move. The aftermath helped to bring Jeremy Wendell to the forefront. In my opinion, the Jeremy Wendell was one of the most underused characters on the show. He was just as ruthless as J.R but unlike J.R., he had no loyalties or no relationships. He was much more of a serious threat to the Ewings than Cliff, Wes Parmalee, Carter McKay or anyone else ever was. Unfortunately, the producers did not seem very keen on the Wendell character and preferred to give increased screen time to lame characters such as Wilson Cryder, Casey Denault, and Ozwald Valentine.

Another good storyline was Sue Ellen's newfound emotional strength. In previous seasons, there was a cycle with the Sue Ellen character. Sue Ellen finds out that J.R. is cheating. Sue Ellen herself cheats. Sue Ellen suffers a setback in that relationship. Sue Ellen turns to the bottle. Sue Ellen reconciles with J.R. and pretty soon the cycle start all over again. However in season 10, the producers decided to break that cycle by giving Sue Ellen a company in which she can use to come up with a master plan to humiliate J.R. and his new mistress Mandy Winger. Instead of being upset when the plan unravels, J.R. actually tips his hat to Sue Ellen. She responds by saying that she learned from the best. This would ultimately lead to another reconciliation going into the next season.

The third major storyline is the Wes Parmalee as Jock revelation. While the storyline is entertaining, it is so far-fetched that it actually becomes unintentionally funny at times. In soap operas, a plane crash is a convenient way to kill off a character. It is convenient because, with no body found, it always leaves the door open for that character to be resurrected. In ""Dallas"" alone, four characters died in plane crashes (Dusty Farlow, Jock Ewing, Rebecca Wentworth, Marc Graison). Out of the four, three were brought back in some capacity. Dusty was brought back as himself. Marc was brought back as part of a ""long dream"" by Pam. Now, it was Jock's turn to come back.  It would have been one thing to actually bring back the real Jock. But to bring him back in the body of someone else who is much shorter and talks differently is another thing. This unbelievability led to many scenes where I found myself laughing for all the wrong reason. Who could forget the scene where he gets up at the Oil Baron's Ball and states the Jock Ewing Memorial Scholarship should no longer exist because he is still alive and that all Ewing Oil business will go through him. I know that the producers were trying to create tension in the family and create a threat to the ownership of Ewing Oil. However, there are much more believable ways to do this without straining credibility.

The fourth major storyline was the whole Cliff/April/Jamie/Jack connection, which for the most part did not work very well. The Jamie and Jack Ewing characters were very inconsistent. All the major screen time that they previously had was erased by the dream season. It was almost as if the producers did not know what to do with them. The Jamie Ewing character was almost a walking contradiction. She hated the Ewings and all they stood for, yet she married Cliff who was really no different. Like with Cliff's previous girlfriend Afton, you were constantly wondering what she saw in Cliff, who treated her like dirt. After the whole battle for Ewing Oil with Cliff, the Jamie character became somewhat useless. Her brother, Jack Ewing, at first came across as very arrogant and self-absorbed. However, some time between the end of season 9 and beginning of season 11, he all of a sudden became morally righteous. Then all of a sudden when you felt that there would be some sort of conflict between him and either Cliff or the Ewings, he just disappeared into thin air. It was to the point where he was referred to more than he was actually seen.  Midway through the season, Jack's ex-wife, April Stevens, was introduced. While April eventually becomes a beloved character, she was very lame and unconvincing when she first appeared on the scene. She was almost the exact same character as Marilee Stone, who is impressed with money and sleeps her way to the top. However, I think that the producers soon realized that with Victoria Principal leaving the show, they needed to find a love interest for Bobby. Hence, they decided to make April a much more likable character.

Lastly, the whole Bobby/Jenna/Pam/Ray/Donna love triangle just did not work at all. The Jenna character was one of the worst characters to appear on the show. She had absolutely no charisma and it made no sense why Bobby would be attracted to her. While she should have just been a bump in the road for Bobby and Pam, the producers decided to keep her on the show for 5 seasons (4 real seasons + one dream season).  When Bobby left her for Pam, you would think that she would have less screen time or even be banished from the show. However, the producers decided to create a brilliant plot where she becomes pregnant with Bobby's child right before Bobby marries Pam and she ends up in a relationship with his half-brother Ray who is having a baby with his estranged wife Donna who spends most of her time in Washington and is romancing a Senator. Do you follow all that? It almost plays out as bad as it sound. Except for Bobby, all of these characters are just plain tiresome and have long outlived their usefulness. Pam just becomes too emotional and sappy that it seems like in almost every scene she is either crying or berating J.R. or Cliff. With the Ray character, it seemed like the producers always tried way too hard to come up with story lines for him. I mean how interesting can you possibly make a ranch foreman on a show about power and deception. He was once a prominent cast member but being with Jenna really brought his character down. With the divorce, his soon-to-be ex-wife Donna also becomes obsolete to the show. She travels to Washington and becomes so independent of the rest of the cast that you almost felt that she was on her own spin-off show. Her only connection was through occasional meetings with Ray. When the producers thankfully remove her character from the show at the end of the season, you realize how pointless the whole Washington/Senator Dowling angle really was.

To summarize, while season 10 is uneven, it still has some good enough storylines that make it interesting enough to want to keep watching.  While the show is long removed from the glory years, it still manages to surprise you and keep you guessing at times.",1287100800,21,8317,4.716448726772195

Miami"" did a few years ago with a faked death, Jamie & Sue Ellen escaping the explosions, Mark disappearing after he learned of J.R.'s plot to blackmail him regarding his college secret, Ray & Donna losing custody of the foster child(again) & this putting their marriage in trouble once more, Jenna not being pregnant, these would have been much better resolutions from Season 9 in my view that all could have been told in this season's first episode, but as one reviewer noted executive producer Leonard Katzsman had a bruised ego to mend after being sqeezed out of Season 9, & so we (the fans) were told it was a dream(dumb!!!), well....., on to the review, this season is in my view one of the best, despite Season 9's cliffhanger not being resolved!!!!...,  J.R. is up to his old tricks again, only this time he gets more than he bargained for when he hires a mercenary to carry out explosions in the middle east to boost oil prices, this becomes J.R.'s undoing & makes for some interesting drama, Sue Ellen goes into the fashion business, Bobby & Pam remarry, & Ray & Donna divorce, also a man named Wes Palmelee claims to be a not-dead Jock Ewing, it should be noted that this character played by Steve Forrest also played a similar character at the end of Season 9 that possesed the same possibility, was he Jock?, the viewer is left to decide which I thought was cool, despite this being a good season, I feel it should have been the last, this one ended with J.R. & Bobby losing Ewing Oil due to J.R.'s mishap with the mercenary that unknown to J.R. was being watched by the CIA & knew of J.R.'s involvement, although the CIA let them slide, The Ewing's had the misfortune of a man working as a file clerk for the CIA also being the brother of woman whose husband commits suiside because of being arrested for blowing up a Ewing oil field all because of being laid off by Bobby & J.R., Miss Elle also washes her hands of J.R. & Bobby over this misdeed in a speech that would make any son cringe, this was indeed the last good season... it was Victoria Principal, Susan Howard, Deborah Shelton, & Jennilee Harrison's last season on the show, & although we still had Linda Gray, Pricilla Presley & newcomer Sherrie J. Wilson, it wasn't enough to sustain it beyond this season, they fought hard to get Patrick Duffy & Barbara Bel Geddes( absent from Season 8) back, but lost other cast members again, when this happens, it only means one thing.. it is time to end the show , this one ended on not so happy note, but a realistic one where J.R.'s schemes finally catch up with him as he loses Ewing Oil, all in all a good season, but they should have ended it here.",1264636800,,3057,4.420212765957447

3506921,5,B001C9S0F0,"Remember how each episode of ""The Wild Wild West"" began with ""The Night of""?  Or ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" used ""The ____ Affair"" for each installment?  Well, the best way to describe season ten (really season NINE, but that's another story) would be to use the word ""year"" as a reference point:

This season, in no particular order) was:

1) ""The Year of Valentine Lingerie"" - In this storyline Sue Ellen (the one and only Linda Gray) becomes a worthy equal to husband J.R. (the Emmy-deserving Larry Hagman) as she becomes a successful entrepreneur and manipulator.  Deborah Shelton, as J.R.'s latest ""fling"", Mandy Winger, is stunning as the symbol for the company, especially when she wears a big hat and a color-coordinated outfit.  Derek McGrath is hilarious as Ozwald Valentine, the most unlikely designer of ""naughty nighties.""

2) ""The Year of the Awakening"" - Fortunately, the controversial ""solution"" to bring back Bobby (Patrick Ewing) is so quickly introduced in the first episode that viewers can jump into the plot devices for this season.

3) ""The Year of the Comic Relief"" - While Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval) has always been fodder for J.R., in this season he becomes the show's true buffoon, getting involved in one thing after another, in his quest to get the family that ""wronged"" his daddy.

4) ""The Year of Male Chauvinism"" - The writers intentionally (I hope) poked fun at the train of thought by having so many sexist comments made by Cliff and others in the cast, as well as situations where the female of the species was treated with less-than-polite respect.

5) ""The Year of the Minority"" - While there have been minorities seen - and even given a line or two - in the past, this was the season that saw them featured more prominently.  Teresa (Roseanna Christiansen), the Ewing's Hispanic maid, gets more  screen time and even gets to say more than ""Dinner is served"".  Dora Mae, (the statuesque and always coiffed-to-the-nines Pat Colbert) is shown and heard more frequently to patrons of the Oil Baron's Restaurant and even gets to react to the actions of her customers, especially in a confrontation between Cliff and Jeremy Wendell.  J.A. Preston even appears in several episodes as crafty CIA agent Leo Daltry.  Daltry gets to deliver one of the more memorable lines of the season, one that makes J.R. speechless.

6) ""The Year of Departures"" - Suffice it to say, this season sees several ""PRINCIPAL"" leavings, including one of the original cast members.

7) ""The Year of the Secretary"" - All three of the ""girl Fridays"" get some increased screen time from J.R.'s Sly (Deborah Rennard) to Cliff's Jackie (Sherill Lynn Rettino) to Bobby's Phyllis (Deborah Tranelli).  Even Sly becomes president of one of J.R.'s ""dummy"" corporations.

8) ""The Year of Jeremy Wendell"" - William Smithers as the devious oilman makes a worthy adversary for J.R., fitting in prominently in the season finale.

9) ""The Year of Ray and Jenna"" - Though just as equally dull as ""The Year(s)of Ray and Donna"", the story does allow some decent moments between actors Steve Kanaly and Priscilla Presley.

10) ""The Year of Wes Parmalee"" - This is probably the most absurd of the season's plot lines, but it does allow from some stellar acting from Barbara Bell Geddes (remarkable as always as Miss Ellie), Howard Keel as Ellie's husband Clayton, and guest Steve Forrest as the-man-who-might-be Jock Ewing.

The sound and picture of the DVD are not up to par with previous compilations and there are no ""extras,"" not even audio commentary on select episodes.",1252108800,5,3561,4.909849749582638
3506922,5,B001C9S0F0,"I'm looking very forward to seeing this season 10 of ""Dallas,"" for I missed many of it's original run episodes due to having lost interest in the show's ""storylines"" after the excellent ninth season became a great big ""dream.""

I believe that anything explaining Bobby's ""death"" by returning him back to the show would have been much more welcomed by the show's fans, other than the whole ninth season being explained as Pam's ""dream."" This disrupted the show too much and caused the whole ninth season's great storyline's to unravel and the show's watchers were pretty much being told to ""forget"" the whole past year's events, due to Pam having had a nightmare. ""You've gotta be kiddin'??"" Many fans, like me, were no doubt asking themselves. If Patrick Duffy and the show's producers were so determined to bring him back to the show, couldn't the writers come up with something more creative than simply saying the whole ninth season had been a product of Pam's imagination as she lay sleeping? Creative? I don't think so, just plain lazy on the part of the show's writers.

The writers could have brought Patrick Duffy back to ""Dallas"" with a lot more creative options, such as; (1) Explain Bobby's death by saying that Weststar kidnaps Bobby from the hospital and allows the family to believe that Bobby has died. Keeping Bobby held prisoner at their business compound, they subject him to hypnotists, who try to learn more about what he knows about Ewing Oil and the various business' dealings concerning Weststar interests. Bobby escapes and returns home in ""Season 10."" (2) Mark Graison bribes some dishonest and greedy doctors at the hospital to fake Bobby's death and has Bobby moved a secluded medical facility. Mark learned that Bobby may live as a human ""vegtable"" and he didn't want Pam grieving her life away for him. Bobby recovers completely at the medical facility and at the end of season 9 we see someone in medical bandages sitting in a chair. A doctor and nurse are slowly removing the bandages from this person's head and face. A hand held mirror is held up to reveal the face...it's Bobby Ewing! Imagine the suspense of Season 10's first episode!

Just thinking about the many other possible ""situations"" that could have explained Patrick Duffy's return as Bobby Ewing, make me realize how much more fun the show could have been in future seasons and may have even extended the show's run for several more years.  I'm a huge fan of all of the `80's prime time soap operas and enjoyed watching them as they originally aired, but I'm pleasantly finding that I'm enjoying seeing the ones that are available on DVD a bit more now than then!  All of the ""Dallas"" seasons are highly entertaining and regardless of what season set you enjoy seeing the most, all of them are far superior to anything that's on T.V. at present.

3506932,4,B001C9S0F0,"This season left season 9 viewers feeling cheated originally since season 9 was all a dream which explains the surprise starting with Bobby and Pam. It also spelled doom for the Jenna and Charlie characters and just when you thought Bobby and Pam were back together, one of them wanted out of the show, so the ending is quite clear, lending to actor's remorse the following season. The industry hates actors or actresses who make things tough on the set for others or who don't want to be a part of things. Hollywood has a very long memory! As for Dallas season 10 this year was the year that JR would put his son's life at risk as well as his own and other family members. A romantic old cowboy would come back claiming he was Jock Ewing and finally, would this be the end of Ewing Oil? You will have to watch to find out. Certainly not the best season of the series, but as collections go, worth watching things anyhow. I didn't really find any extras with this set worth while, though this late 80's season restoration was top quality and the sound was as usual, excellent. I have a very large widescreen plasma with full surround sound and though Dallas is a bit stretched as it was formatted for  the 4/3 format, it still went very well at home.

3506935,4,B001C9S0F0,"I'm one of the newer fans of 'Dallas,' having gotten into the show by the way of the DVD releases. I wasn't entirely impressed with the previous season, known as the 'dream' season due to the cliffhanger which is dealt with in the first few moments of this season. In terms of quality, I felt season 10 was a bit weaker than the previous seasons. In comparison, while the previous season didn't really make sense, there was a lot packed into the season and the female members of the cast really shined in that season. Season 10 felt like a big turn-about, with the focus being back on J.R. and his antics, while the women of 'Dallas' were reduced to weaker roles. Pam goes back to being a bit annoying, whiney and always seeming as if she's going to come apart. Donna is seen as a strong woman while taking on a new, prominent job but unable to get through to Ray or plainly address her marital issues. Jenna is the damsel in distress along with Charlie (her daughter) giving her grief with her teenage-bratty behavior.

Show and plot wise, I felt the first couple of episodes were outright dull.  With an entire season of the show having suddenly never happened, the producers seemed bent on starting where the show ended two seasons ago, while leaving certain plots and characters in the dust. The season didn't get interesting until it tackled a rather common soap-plot; a character 'allegedly' returns from the dead and their re-appearance rattles everyone. Then, mid-season, this plot is dropped and brushed under the rug. BUT then we're treated to outside forces coming at J.R. and getting the best of him and Ewing Oil being caught in the crossfire. Miss Ellie really has the best plot and moments throughout the season, while the usual suspects, Sue Ellen and J.R., continue to attempt to make sense of their marital woes. Throughout the season, Pam just seems to be around to play back-up to Bobby and complain as usual about the Barnes/Ewing feuds. The last five or so episodes of the season though are top quality and packed with intrigue, excitement and suspense.

DVD wise, the transfer was good and crisp, but the lack of any special features bothered me. There was plenty to comment on or build a feature around but all we get with this release are the episode, which, at 30 episodes is enough when some shows are being divided up and sold at a high price nowadays. While the show itself felt as if it was starting to take on a true soap opera vibe, once it shook the 'dream season' woes off and started on some new plots, it definitely held my attention. I thought it was a shame that the female characters on the show seemed to be given such typical soap opera plots and materials - jealous of the 'other woman,', scheming to keep their men, enchanted by the lure of other men and business opportunities - but what happens mid-season seems to bring everyone together and makes for the slower moments at the beginning. In all, a decent season with the weakness being in the plot and lack of character development for some of the women but overall good and worth your money.",1233964800,,3089,4.592391304347826

The shipment time was good and I am looking forward to receiving the 11th season, however, if I receive another set that looks like this one, I will have to go back to Warner Bros to buy the next time.

As a Dallas fan most likely you were NOT happy learning season 9 was a waste.

Ok, so when we learn this more mistakes were made like keeping the horrible Jenna (Priscilla Presley badly playing the character) in this season.  And, I ALWAYS hated the Charlie her daughter characters.

Jack & Jaime were not needed.

They went into all different areas in this season.  It was obvious Dallas had seen it's better days .  This was where a fan like me started to lose interest.

The DVD package.  Horrible to even open.  Discs badly secured inside.

3506938,2,B001C9S0F0,"Fans already have their opinions on the storylines, so let's take a brief look at ""Dallas"" from a technical perspective. This was the first season that post-production was done on video rather than film (even color-correction, which renders the beauty of Metrocolor irrelevant). The lush beauty of the 35mm film masters is lost in the primitive 640x480 video medium.

Compounding the pathetic picture quality of the original masters, Warner has jammed FIVE episodes onto each side of the DVDs in this set. The digital compression combined with the disguting quality of the original masters makes watching this set nearly impossible.

In its current 3-disc, unremastered state this collection is for extreme fans only. The best seasons of ""Dallas"" have already been released -- better to treasure those memories than watch a once-great series (and series of DVD releases) whither before your eyes.",1233014400,4,896,5.302816901408451

8286302,3,B001C9S0F0,"I did like the Dream Season.  I thought it was very well done.  It showed a kinder and gentler side of the show.  Sue Ellen battling her alcoholism, reuniting with JR, and becoming a more independent woman.  I did like the Jack story line and the Jaime story line.  It is too bad that Season 10 changed all of that with the exception of the JR and Sue Ellen reconciliation.  I liked Jennile Harrison and Dack Rambo on Dallas.  I wish Leonard Katzman could have done more to include them in more story lines and arcs.  I was not an April fan but she was a Leonard Katzman favorite and he included her in more story lines.  I thought Jenilee Harrison and Dack Rambo were good in Dream Season but their role dwindled in Season 10.  Dallas was heading in a downward spiral after Patrick Duffy returned.  I doubt the show would have lasted longer had he not returned.  It is a mixed bag.  My favorite scene is when Jack pushes Cliff Barnes into the pool in Episode 9.  Barnes was like the village idiot and buffoon throughout the whole season especially when the story line involved Jack and Jaime.  He was such an idiot and that was one of the few parts I liked about the show along with the BD Calhoun story line.  It was a matter of time before Dallas would end. I am surprised it lasted four more years after spring 1987.  The April-Bobby romance was what kept it going. Victoria Principal leaving was the beginning of the end.

Although season 9 was ultimately a dream, I do think some of the storylines could have made for a better season 10 had they chosen not to go the dream route to bring Bobby back. The season 10 episodes have horrible picture quality. It seems they began using a different type of film at this point. Although the DVD episodes are obviously not recorded from the original broadcast reels, I would bet that in original broadcast the picture quality was not that of previous seasons. With that said I have to give this season a very low rating for boring storylines and difficult to watch picture quality.",1504396800,,678,4.565573770491803
