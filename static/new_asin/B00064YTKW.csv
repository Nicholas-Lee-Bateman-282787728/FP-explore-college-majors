8038632,4,B00064YTKW,"I first saw part of this documentary in the mid 80's and have been looking for it ever since. The production is not great nor the picture, but still very viewable. Well done, and does a good job of keeping on subject with details and statistics. It is shorter than I remember. The shot of the climber falling thousands of feet, landing and rolling down the mountainside will be with me forever. He was even wearing a red coat. A must for any fan of mountain climbing, and not necessarily a climber, as I am not that brave or stupid.",1274227200,,532,4.33
8038633,5,B00064YTKW,This is an excellent film however the description of participants is misleading The main participant is Eric Jones who is NOT mentioned in description page The two mentioned Harrer and Heckmire as far as I know are not involved in the climbing  This misleading information led me to think this was another film about soloing the Eiger when in fact it turns out to be the same as the one I already posses and resulting in my having to return it.,1198368000,,444,4.481481481481482
8038634,1,B00064YTKW,"This would of been a great video if it actually worked. There is good history and awesome camera work but DVD did not play through instead it would stop at every scene and leave the viewer in the scene menu requiring the viewer to physically click on next scene in order to continue watching the video.

I returned the DVD in exchange for another. The return and exchange transaction went smoothly and I got the new DVD in 2 days! Unfortunately the replacement DVD had the same issues. Maybe it was a bad batch but I didn't bother trying to get a third one.",1186704000,4,557,4.355769230769231
8038635,5,B00064YTKW,Nice dvd of the Eiger climb.  What can you say? I have hiked along the face and can only admire those that go up from there.,1179273600,2,124,3.769230769230769
8038636,1,B00064YTKW,"Eiger Solo is one of the great mountaineering films, beautifully written, filmed and finished.

This DVD, however, is a travesty: a washed-out picture, poor sound -- even the navigation controls don't work right.

Does Leo Dickinson know about this bum package?",1130371200,6,261,5.341463414634147
8038637,5,B00064YTKW,"I've got no complaints really. I got what I wanted, which was a proper documentary on Eiger North Face. Highly recommended!",1127174400,5,123,4.904761904761905
8038638,4,B00064YTKW,"Back in the late 60s I checked out a book called ""Straight Up"" not really knowing what it was about. It was about the life of John Harlin, great book, interesting man, tragic ending to his enormous life. Since that time the Eiger has always been a presence in my life. I journeyed to it's face back in '78, stared straight up at it's face and was awed. This VHS should be a CD by now, but sadly it's not. I've never climbed the Eiger, the pull was never that strong, and having retired from all but the most recreational climbing, I'm now out of the game. Nonetheless the lure of the Eiger, it's legendary status among those who consider such things as legendary is profound. Enjoy this VHS. The Eiger's ""will,"" will hold your rapt attention.",1082419200,3,742,4.423357664233577
8038639,5,B00064YTKW,"As I watched this video my palms actually began to sweat, and I got butterflies in my stomach.  The film is expertly done, and the stories of the first unsuccessful, and first successful attempts added a polished touch to the story.  Having been a climber for almost 20 years, I appreciated a film that told the truth about climbing.  It is the best I've seen.",1061424000,7,360,4.507692307692308
