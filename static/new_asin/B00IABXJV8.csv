8640364,1,B00IABXJV8,"I love boys and I watched this in the hopes of seeing interviews or concert footage. Instead it was full commentary based on gossip speculation. Portraying Harry as a womanizer is all false speculation and defaming the other boys based gossip is untrue. These adults don't know the , the way fans do, and this documentary just proves how wanted to provide most scandalous content for views, regardless of its truth.

This documentary was supposed to feature the music and new footage regarding the Where We Are Tour, instead it portrayed boys a false light knowing their audience impressionable young girls.

I love boys and I know how caring Harry truly is, he's a perfect gentleman who hasn't shagged all of Los Angeles. I know Zayn is a private person, in love with his artwork and dedicated to Perrie. Though Liam takes the lead as the dad he still one the boys there no resentment between them. Louis may be oldest, and a joker but his is and truly appreciate fans. Niall is more than just his accents and his guitar, he's just as valuable as the boys he just as loved.

The boys are most humble genuine artists I know this documentary portrayed horribly. It's a shame really that only true fans will the real them because videos like these are so misleading.",1487808000,,1264,4.633928571428571
