Fish Out of Water is an intimate look into the lives of these colorful seabirds, and includes the first-ever recorded scenes of Maine coast puffins feeding and raising their chick inside a rock burrow. This award winning film also explores the intriguing lives of Arctic and common terns, and the history of the National Audubon Society biologists working with Project Puffin to restore and preserve these fragile colonies.""",1317772800,,547,5.2272727272727275
