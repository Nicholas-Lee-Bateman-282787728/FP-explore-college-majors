7028182,4,B00U2YNKO2,"Very much in the vein of Shaun of the Dead. A unique take on the apocalypse. The writing was intelligent. The two main actors of the film did a great job. It is clearly low budget, but it has the feel of a very well-produced film. Not choppy and no stupid shaky cam. This is more of a comedy than horror, but it does have its suspenseful points. With more a budget the cockroach scenes would have been better just take that with a grain of salt. Otherwise the effects are decent. The fourth act is its strongest point the drama is believable. Enjoyable and worth a viewing.",1506988800,,573,4.314814814814815
7028183,5,B00U2YNKO2,"Pretty decent for a low budget flick..... Watchable and pretty funny at times..... I also found the characters likable, which is rare in these low budget horror films..... It wasn't the highest quality film with an A-list cast but it was good with realistic characters and decent acting",1506384000,,286,4.979166666666667
7028184,4,B00U2YNKO2,"quirky / funny / and at times a bit gory / scary...  yes, it's an indie flick, but I thought it was done well...  soundtrack was actually really good, and sound overall was just fine...  ( not sure what that other reviewer was talking about )",1505952000,,242,4.217391304347826

7028186,5,B00U2YNKO2,A Lynchian buddy comedy with awesome performances. A+.,1489881600,,54,5.875
7028187,4,B00U2YNKO2,"Great movie.  I saw this at the Eerie Horror Film Festival.  This could've turned out to be a boring bad movie, but Gotta skillfully keeps us entertained.  At first the quirkiness of the main characters threw me off, but ended up loving them.  I recommended this to people who enjoy sci-fi comedies.",1454889600,,299,4.6923076923076925

7028189,5,B00U2YNKO2,"What an independent horror should be, takes chances and is not afraid to put character over kills. Highly recommended for viewers seeking horror that is off the beaten path and a little on the quirky side, ala Evil Dead 2.",1432944000,2,222,4.575
7028190,1,B00U2YNKO2,Nothing is wrong with my computer or speakers so its the movie...the sound is so screwed up i couldn't even watch it. It looked like it sucked anyway even though i didn't get that far. And i tried playing it on different players & still the same thing. What a cheap mess. I want a refund.,1432339200,,288,4.160714285714286
7028191,5,B00U2YNKO2,This film is a tour-de-force in brilliant dialogue. The 2 main characters (whose interaction occupies the majority of the movie) are engaging and very funny. A very unique and memorable experience. Highly recommended.,1431993600,4,217,5.606060606060606
7028202,4,B00U2YNKO2,"I like B flicks that don't take themselves seriously, for me goofy and campy fits better for these low budget horror flicks and in such this flick did it well.",1511913600,2,159,4.333333333333333
7028203,5,B00U2YNKO2,"I gave this film 5 stars because it's the second best film ever made. You should watch this either alone or with other people, it's up to you.",1511481600,,142,4.107142857142857

7028205,2,B00U2YNKO2,"A long silly movie about absolutely nothing. Ok buddy jokes between the main characters but storyline was non-existant. I love watching decent B-horror movies and am not that critical of most, but this was just a waste of time",1511136000,,226,4.82051282051282

Still entertaining, although I didn't make it all the way through to the end.",1509667200,,180,4.59375
7028208,5,B00U2YNKO2,"This movie was one of the most funniest movies I have ever scene. Funnier than most comedy shows you see now days. It also gives the viewer a really good taste in mystery while being kind of scary. Well, it was only a tiny bit scary but overall awesome story. Try to ignore the other ratings. I don't agree with them because they are basically people saying they don't remember the movie or the graphics need work. Honestly, the graphics isn't a real problem because the movie only features unrealistic things very few times and everything else is pretty much real.",1509667200,,565,4.603960396039604
7028209,4,B00U2YNKO2,Good low budget Comedy Horror Zombie flick.  Worth the time watching and you kinda feel for the characters all the way through it,1509148800,,129,4.608695652173913

7028211,4,B00U2YNKO2,It was funny and quite watchable. I enjoyed it,1508198400,,46,4.222222222222222
8704200,1,B00U2YNKO2,Skip forward to 30 minutes if you want to see how awful the special effects are. I would say that this should be with the comedy movies instead except this movie also fails at being funny.,1533168000,,188,4.25
8704201,4,B00U2YNKO2,This was a delightful surprise with cute dialog and pretty good acting.  Not big or middle budget but some real creepy quirky things pretty much a pleasant surprise.,1525392000,,165,4.892857142857143
8704202,4,B00U2YNKO2,"Lousy in a good way. There were so many illogical and down right stupid things going on this movie, which made it fun. Lets just saying that his ""rescue"" of her was downright insane.",1524441600,,182,4.382352941176471
8704203,5,B00U2YNKO2,"This was a fun, quirky, horror-comedy that really surprised me. The horror parts, while at least on one occasion a bit low budget, were effective, and the comedy aspects were fantastic and several times laugh out loud with witty dialogue and to my surprise a Princess Bride reference.

The story only had three people with any speaking role (maybe a few more if you count radio and TV personalities speaking in the background), and of those three people one of them was only in one scene and that scene was fairly early in the film (the estranged wife of a next door neighbor whose husband had just passed away, coming to see to his effects). The movie centers on two roommates in a somewhat run-down Brooklyn apartment building, a man named Daniel (played by Nat Cassidy) and a woman named Margot (played Jessi Gotta). Not romantically involved but clearly friends, they have been making the best of a bad situation, as New York City has been hit by multiple large hurricanes in the last few years, all the bridges and tunnels are out to Manhattan (and perhaps elsewhere), there are strictly enforced curfews (one we hear on the radio in the background and Margot and Daniel talk about is at 7pm), they often go without power or phone service for hours at a time, and the water is terrible, said to be drinkable but smelly and weird looking though Margot and Daniel have their shelves of bottled water and lots and lots of booze.

Oh, and three people have died in their apartment building in the last few months. Margot and Daniel try to rationalize the deaths, Daniel a bit more skeptical of there being anything to worry about, Margot less so. Over time as the days progress, other odd things start to be noticed by two roommates; the odd, sludgey water in their coffee machine, the one and then two people who just stand outside for hours and then a day or more on the sidewalk across the street, looking at nothing in particular and not moving, the scuttling things they notice in the dark, the super downstairs who may or may not be a zombie, the giant dog-sized cockroach that they find one day in their den, just as the power goes out, because of course then it goes out.

The movie is a weird mix of dangers from toxic weird water with strange effects, giant roaches, and zombies, alternately between everyman horror (and later body horror) as the two roommates try to hunker down and deal with the crisis as best they can (which at first centers around watching DVDs and drinking booze) and some almost slapstick comedy at other times great dialogue-based comedy. The two leads had fantastic chemistry and comedic delivery and timing while when they were in a horror scene where believable as every day people (not action heroes). They were profane at times but not unbelievably so, coming off as people who have seen things and learned to ignore certain things, perhaps from being New Yorkers, perhaps from living in a world that has increasingly gotten worse with the storms and the curfews and the infrastructure breakdown. I cant decide which of the two were my favorite as they were both effective and both supported the other.

Some might not like the film as to me it was a bit more of a comedy than a horror film, though it definitely had horror elements. Sometimes it was a tiny bit low budget as yes the giant roach did look a bit rubbery but it came off as we really did the best we could, please believe it instead of eh, who cares, it might even be funny if it looked fake. Most of the time the budget was just fine in my opinion, with the zombies and the toxic water sludge quite believable. I really liked how 99% of the film was in that Brooklyn apartment building (the tiny bit not was the sidewalk outside and the various scenes visible from their apartment window), reminding me a little of the third installment in the _Mimic_ series of films (_Mimic: Sentinel_) or the novel _14_ by Peter Clines (though both of those examples involved more than just two people, both were almost completely set in apartment buildings or apartment complexes and involved some sort of creepy crawly; also both were excellent and I highly recommend them).",1523750400,,4168,4.613207547169812
