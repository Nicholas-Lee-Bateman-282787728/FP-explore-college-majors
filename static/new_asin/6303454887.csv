I taped and what I found was a semi-classic that had  been hidden for many years. Before Perfect Blue came out I'm sure this was  one of the only anime of its kind. The story is about Remi Shimada (of the  GoShogun team) who has a car accident and wakes up in a different world.  From there she must face her greatest fears and overcome her weaknesses. If  you can ever find this video rent it. For anime fans who enjoyed Perfect  Blue!",957657600,,608,4.153846153846154
7847240,4,6303454887,"To fully enjoy and understand this movie, one must see the goshogun series that was shown over 10 years ago in TV. The story was about Remy Shimada, the only girl member of Goshogun team that was lying very sick. The story  then evolved in Remy's dream state to the time when all the members fight  together for Remy's life years ago, when they had not yet separated for  their private lives. Too bad the Goshogun series is not available  everywhere now. I think the classic Goshogun, along with Voltes V and God  Sigma, are the best Japanese animation ever.",947376000,,558,4.54
