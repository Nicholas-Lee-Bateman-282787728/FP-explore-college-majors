8169352,3,B000MIQZ0O,"Fair, as I remember it, early to mid 60's sword and sandal film.  Typical goings on about a good guy righting wrongs and fighting evil-doers.  What I remember most is that the video is in black-and-white and as far as I know most of these movies from this period were made in color.  Hopefully a good quality color DVD is released very soon.",1429315200,,341,4.380952380952381
