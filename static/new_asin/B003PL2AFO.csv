8516066,5,B003PL2AFO,"""Fixer: The Taking of Ajmal Naqshbandi"" is a great documentary that follows the relationship between an Afghan interpreter and his client, American journalist Christian Parenti. This intimate portrait of two colleagues shifts dramatically when Ajmal is kidnapped along with an Italian reporter. The situation goes from bad to worse as foreign powers pressure for fast results, the Afghan government bungles its response and the specter of Taliban power looms in the background. What follows is the tragic story of one man forgotten in the crossfire: a brutal allegory of the proud land and perilous misadventure that is Afghanistan.

This is an extremely interesting look at the Afghan government and I really learned a great deal. The storyline allows it to be both educational and interesting. This documentary definitely kept me at the edge of my seat.",1277164800,4,855,5.286764705882353
