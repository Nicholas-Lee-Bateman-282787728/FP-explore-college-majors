3853165,3,B00269OW66,"I have at least 16 Bette Davis DVD's at this point and am a HUGE fan. I even have the very rare 'Another Man's Poison' and a remastered version of 'Of Human Bondage' on DVD. I had never seen Payment on Demand and was wildly excited to get it in the mail.

It is a good film. It is not one of Davis' most memorable however. There isn't enough of her extraordinary acting ability in it. She plays it safe in this, for the most part. Still, she can get tears out of you at the end when she weeps in the car.

The picture quality is absolutely superb, as is the sound.

I recommend this to seasoned Davis collectors, but not for a new fan. This is not going to grab a ""newbie"" in any profound way. For that, I would recommend 'Now Voyager', 'The Letter' or 'All About Eve.'",1254873600,59,769,4.079470198675497
3853166,5,B00269OW66,"I have waited 35 years for this film to come out on Vcr or otherwise. There is talk of TV eposodes being 'a lost eposode. Well I think that this is a great 'lost Bette Davis movie'. I seen it in the show when I was very young and many years later on national television. But that was in the 50's or 60's. But I always remembered this film and thought it was just as goog (if not bettet) than her most populer films. Barry Sullivan who played her husband in the film was also great as was the two young ladies who played her daughters. Especially Betty Lynn. I believe Betty Lynn and Bette remained lifelong friends after they did this movie togrther. I go on and out in saying 'movie' and 'film', because when I was a kid they were all 'movies'. Especially for movie fans.
This movie ""Payment On Demand"" about a very controlling woman said so much. That everybody eventually will walk away. If it be in the homeor on the job or in friendships or relationships. A controlling bitch is intolerable. Sooner or later  they all lose what means most to them in the end. In many of Bette Davis's films she portrayed
women of very bad character defects and there was a lesson to be learned in watching her films. If you could 'get it!'. Yes the ending of the film was sort of leaving you hanging, but it was okay. You can't expect a husband to take their wife back after she nearling ruined his life in so many ways. At least not right away. Yeah, ""Payment On Demand"" is one of my all time favorite Bette Davis movies.  Thank you.",1249344000,16,1522,4.28125
3853167,4,B00269OW66,"I've waited over 20 years to finally see a good copy of this film. Very crisp realease. Strangely touching. Good performance by Bette. She had to play a much younger woman so it was fun to see how well they photographed her to accomplish this. For the most part she really did look younger but other places you could see that she really did look all of 42. Touching movie. Lots of great hats by the ladies throughout and Edith Head really gives Bette some great gowns to wear. (Though, NOT the party scene gown!) And that hairdo! She looked 60!
 In regards to the changed ending of the film....well, it worked for me.
Maybe the original was better (it was changed before release) BUT my goodness we have enough great cynical works out there in art and in life!
Why 4 stars....Well, All About Eve is 5 stars!...naturally",1239494400,17,819,4.496644295302014
3853168,5,B00269OW66,"I found this movie extremely good. The plot really kept you thinking and the acting excellent. Bette Davis was brilliant  as was Barry Sullivan, I always enjoy Barry Sullivan. Bette Davis was once again her wonderful self; she amazes me how her acting is always great and this role was perfect for her. All in all I loved it.",1464048000,3,325,4.508474576271187
3853169,5,B00269OW66,"Love Bette Davis movies and this was just as good as many of her top rated ones with great actors and co stars. Totally satisfied with entire purchasing process, quality, price and time received. Recommend movie and seller",1449878400,,222,4.868421052631579

3853176,3,B00269OW66,"As a Davis fan, it's worth the time to see any Davis ""performance"".  Even though this production had it's ""producer's"" problems, and was ultimately cut-and spliced up to the moment it was opening, it captures a few moments of pretty good (Davis) acting.  To paraphrase some (singer's) reviews, Davis could ""read"" the Los Angeles phone book on stage and capture an audience, and maybe get another Oscar nomination. Not one of my favorites, but it holds its own in my movie collection (and on the shelf with about 80 other Davis DVDs now available).",1418169600,,547,4.808510638297872
3853177,5,B00269OW66,Just love Bette Davis. She is the only lady that is unbeatable. Want all of her movies in time and I hope soon.,1398211200,,111,3.869565217391304
3853188,3,B00269OW66,I had never seen this movie and as a BD fan I really wanted to.  Not a very good movie.  It will be a long time before I re-watch this one.,1396656000,,139,3.4516129032258065
3853189,2,B00269OW66,"If anyone could breathe a semblance of life into even the most turgid script, Bette Davis could. But not even the ever-resourceful Bette can salvage this misbegotten effort. Told primarily in flashbacks filmed on scrimmed sound-stages (a la Jo Mielziner's sets for DEATH OF A SALESMAN), this rambling variation on CRAIG'S WIFE plods around Robin Hood's barn until it finally runs out of steam. But rather than allow it end as it logically should, the producers decided to tack-on a brazenly unbelievable ""hopeful ending""...presumably to satisfy the primarily female matinee audiences of the day. Poor Bette! If you want to see the cinematic equivalent of sausage-making, this is it.",1371427200,2,682,5.26605504587156
3853190,1,B00269OW66,"Betty Davis did not play her usual role; she was more like on good behavior in this movie.  The only thing that was interesting in this movie is the viewers get to see what her real life daughter looks like.  Otherwise, don't waste your money or time.",1358035200,3,251,4.319148936170213
3853191,5,B00269OW66,"I am a huge fan of the movies of the 30's and 40's especially James Cagney, George Brent, and of course Bette Davis, I just received Housewife and The Sisters.  It is very sad that today's movies (ie. remakes) like The Postman always rings twice, it not as well made and cast as well as Lana Turner, and John Garfield.  Couldn't they come up with movies of their own, instead of remakes, for example Mildred Pierce,
I am not a real Joan Crawford fan, but how can the stars today compete with her performance!

3853192,5,B00269OW66,"A great film, that should have been titled The Story of a Divorce, but got this title instead.

In any case, Bette Davis is so remarkable in it, with her ability to turn the attention to her and for her in the course of this film is amazing, and it is what she needs to do and of course does with great art.

See it and watch that last scene, her face.",1308441600,,352,3.875
3853193,5,B00269OW66,As usual Betty Davis excels in her acting and the story was exellent because many who have been through a divorce would have experienced what she acted out. I cannot fault any of her movies and this dvd was another one of her exellent movies.,1304294400,,242,4.4
3853194,5,B00269OW66,first of all I must say I love Bette Davis & have many of her movies. I just found this one because it was just put out on DVD. She plays a wife who will do anything to get her husband ahead. Even if it is wrong. She runs his life totally. After a while he stopped putting up with her & walks out on her & they divorce. A very good movie.,1304208000,,338,3.643835616438356

3853197,4,B00269OW66,"I was thrilled to find this movie available on DVD for a very personal reason, my twin sister and I played Diane as a toddler, in the flash back scene. According to my Mother, I was the crying child, who Bette 'switched' with my twin sister,the sweet and well behaved one! (Trust me, that hasn't always been the case!) But what a trip, to watch us, almost 60 years later, being carried around by Bette Davis!!! CJH",1259539200,53,414,4.3896103896103895
