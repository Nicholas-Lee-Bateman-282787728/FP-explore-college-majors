The character of Falstaff is as grotesque, cunning, gullible, and fat as Shakespeare devised him.  The very Robert Green, who supposedly Falstaff is drawn after, would have envied this performance of his character.
I have seen an excellent performance of _The Merry Wives of Windsor_ at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater, and this Globe performance on DVD is up to speed with the best.  It is funny; it stays alive throughout its five acts; and all the characters come alive as they were most likely meant to be.  Mistress Page and Mistress Ford are fantastic, and so is the jealous husband who can't pin down any wrongdoers.
This is women's power at its best.  So much for a society that did not allow women to perform on stage.  Still, I would love to see an original practices performance by an all-male cast one day.  For the time being, this performance does what it is meant to do: make you laugh at the characters and at the gender-based prejudices that surround us to this day.
Totally recommended.",1349136000,12,1064,4.755434782608695
5077640,4,B007CJL17S,"Word has it that Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603) was so amused by Falstaff in Henry IV Part 1 she asked William Shakespeare to write a play with Falstaff in love.  The Bard obliged, but on his own terms.  ""The Merry Wives of Windsor"" is the result.  Thought to be written in two weeks, it's Shakespeare's only play to use England's emerging middle-class as a backdrop.  The subject is courting, and the state of protestant marriage in Elizabethan England.

Falstaff is a knight, but hardly young or dashing.  In Henry IV Part 1 he describes himself as ""A goodly portly man, i'faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage . . ..""  Prince Hal describes him as ""a stuffed cloak-bag of guts"" and ""an old white-bearded Satan.""  Needless to say, he's hardly a catch.  His idea of love is to find a woman who will fund his considerable appetite for food, fun and drink.

Falstaff has his attention focused on two such women, both of whom are married to wealthy town merchants. Both women have flirted with him--or so he has deluded himself into thinking--and both have control of their family's purse.  They are Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, a.k.a. the Merry Wives of Windsor.  He writes them identical love letters, and says, in effect, we both like to drink, neither of us are young; when your husband's away, let's get together and have some fun.

The merry wives are on to Falstaff, however.  They invite him to their homes intending to make a fool of him.  The husbands learn of the planned rendezvous and one of them--Master Ford--believes his wife is about to cheat on him and becomes crazy with jealousy.  The other trusts his wife.  That's half the plot.  The other half involves Anne Page, the daughter of Master and Mistress Page.  As was the Medieval custom, the parents have decided who their daughter will marry, while Anne has other ideas.  She's pursued by three suitors: two of whom (with Falstaff) provide the play's comedic material; the third is the man whom Anne loves.  Anne is seeking a marriage of equals, such as the merry wives enjoy, where women are independent and have fun too--are merry wives--while remaining faithful.  The idea grew out of the Reformation and is a decidedly middle-class ideal.

The ""Merry Wives"" has its fair share of slamming doors, silly pranks, and elements common to farce, but it's more than that.  As always, Shakespeare is holding up a mirror for the world to see itself.  In this case, the mirror reflects the middle class values of Elizabethan England.  The merry wives succeed in making a fool of Falstaff (and the jealous husband sees the error in not trusting his wife), and Anne marries the man she loves.

The Globe Threatre performance sparkles.  Christopher Benjamin, whom I've seen play a number of bit-parts in various BBC productions (""Pride & Prejudice"" from 1995, Midsomer Murders, Foyle's War, etc.) captures Falstaff perfectly, despite lacking the necessary girth.  The absence of subtitles is inexcusable, and the reason for issuing four instead of five stars.",1342137600,22,3069,4.825670498084291
5077641,3,B007CJL17S,"The play itself is pretty good, but the DVD package is very disappointing. First, it has no subtitles. To most people, Shakespeare is a foreign language - it's indefensible to produce a disc of a Shakespeare play without subtitles. Secondly, the picture quality, when viewed on the big TV screens that many people have now, is akin to a used VHS tape. For a 2012 release, that really is not good enough. Why was this not released on Blu-ray as well?

Lastly, being in Europe, it is cumbersome that this is only released on region 1 so far. Educational titles can usually be exempt from region coding, so why is this coded at all? And is there a UK release on the way? Put this out on Blu-ray and with subtitles, and I'll buy it. Again.",1339200000,18,735,4.404411764705882

This is the third play in William Shakespeare's (1564 to 1616) dramatic canon that has Sir John Falstaff, one of the playwright's comedic masterpieces, but this time as the lead character.  He also appears in both parts of the history play  ""Henry the Fourth.""  (He is mentioned in another history play, ""Henry the Fifth."")

This is regarded as a ""minor"" play perhaps because this comedy sounds so un-Shakespearean.  However, scholars laud the creation yet again of the Falstaff character.  He is both glorious and fun.  And the ""wives"" are indeed ""merry.""

This play (written circa 1600) is the most purely farcical of all of Shakespeare's plays.  It depends on lightening-quick timing between the actors and carefully choreographed actions.  The ""meaning"" cannot be separated from the ""performance.""

This play is one of those plays that works better in performance than on the page, since it's filled with sight gags and spoken humour, including outrageous accents and bawdy malapropisms, that are hilarious on stage.

The Globe Theatre's fine production of this play brings this play to life.  The comedic timing is impeccable.  The accents and malapropisms as presented in this production are indeed hilarious.  And the acting is just first-rate with all actors doing their jobs admirably.

Look especially for actor Christopher Benjamin who plays Falstaff, an old lecher, ""well nigh worn to pieces with age,"" who nevertheless fancies himself as a lady-killer.  And then there is Mistress Ford (Sarah Woodward) and Mistress Page (Serena Evans) who both prove that ""wives may be merry and yet honest, too.""

Also look for Dr. Caius (Philip Bird), a cantankerous French physician, usually ""abusing God's patience and the King's English"" and Sir Hugh Evans (Gareth Armstrong), a Welsh person who ""makes fritters of English.""

As well, look for Master Ford later disguised as ""Master Brook"" (Andrew Havill), a gentleman of Windsor, who is taught a lesson by the merry wives.

Finally, this play and production can be thought of as an Elizabethan ""I Love Lucy.""  According to legend, this play mocks Sir Thomas Lucy, who caught the young Shakespeare poaching deer on his land and had him run out of town.

In conclusion, this is a good, solid, hilarious production of William Shakespeare's most frivolous play, which gives us a glimpse of the England of his own time and features one of his greatest comic heroes--Sir John Falstaff.
