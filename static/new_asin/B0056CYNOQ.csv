8459418,5,B0056CYNOQ,"This review and five star rating is specific to the Murnau Film Library region 2 German released version of this film with commentary on other releases.

The Joyless St (Freudlose Gasse) was one of those controversial films which has been butchered by censors almost from the moment of its first screening.  As a result much of the message and social value has been lost in the process of trimming the ""offensive bits"" .  The censors could sure take offensive.  I have been searching for an uncut full version of this film for close on twenty years and we have the the Murnau Film Library to thank that we now have any reasonable portion of the original at all.  The standard truncated versions make the film appear to be a morality play and a Greta Garbo vehicle rather than biting social commentary and a historical picture of the great German Hyperinflation.  In its full form this film is one of the most important films of the silent era.  This version contains the original score, runs about 2:35h as opposed 1 hour found on most of the censored versions and has the original tints.  Tints during the silent era were used to communicate night, day, inside, outside and some emotional states.  This version of the Joyless St makes use of all of the available tints.  Two - three reels of the film are still missing; however this is still the most complete version to date, and probably the most complete version viewed since the original screening whereupon the censors went to work with scissors.

Technical notes related to the Murnau Library version:  This disc uses German Intertitles with English subtitles; somewhat irritating to read but really the only option for someone wanting to view ""the Joyless St"".  It is a region 2 disc, and in the PAL format common to Europe and Australia, so unless you have a Region 0 DVD player or obtain a computer program that allows you to play foreign films you won't be able to watch it. The picture quality is stunning, especially for a film which has been  ""lost"" for 75 years.  Of the eight or so other features all are in German without English subtitles, except for the ""Other Eye"" (Anderen Blick) which is a documentary on the life of Georg W. Pabst; film history buffs will love it.  ""the Other Eye""  is also in spoken German with English subtitles.  Kino (who often works with the Murnau Library) really needs to release this version of the movie in a DVD with English Intertitles.

Some comments on other versions.  The Synergy Version rates a one star.  It makes use of Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance as a musical background; there could not have been a more inappropriate choice.  Print quality is dismal.  I viewed it on Amazon Instant TV.  At 61 Minutes long it is typical of the version that American Audiences would have seen.  The Cinema Classics version also runs at 61 minutes and is likewise missing 90 minutes of the film (rented elsewhere).  The Kino VHS version is 2:00 hours and is the most complete english language version, music is appropriate - but who has a VHS any more?  Besides, the quality loss in VHS and loss of an additional 35 minutes change the flavor of the movie quite a bit.",1379808000,6,3161,4.648648648648648
8459419,5,B0056CYNOQ,"Two middle-class families are dragged into poverty during post-WWI economic collapse in this depressing but artistically triumphant German silent film from 1925, ""The Joyless Street"".  Relative newcomer Greta Garbo and veteran Asta Nielsen give moving performances as the daughters of the families who have to sell more than their possessions in order to survive.  All the action in the film takes place microcosmically in a single street that is occupied by decadent nightclubs and brothels, an evil butcher who trades meat for sex, and miserable denizens who desperately try to survive the many adversities and indignities.  The film was directed by the great G. W. Pabst, who went on to make several more films about the plight of women, such as ""Pandora's Box"" and ""The Diary of a Lost Girl"".  Through Pabst's memorable images and skillful editing, ""The Joyless Street"" is an uncompromising indictment against immorality and cruelty, with a kind of explicitness and provocativeness that perhaps viewers at the time were not ready for.  Censorship occurred almost immediately upon the release of the film, leading to many shortened and butchered editions that were distributed throughout the world.  Starting in the late 80s, attempts have been made to restore the film by Germany's Munich Filmmuseum.  Its most recent restoration resulted in a DVD release which I'm presently reviewing.

The 2-disc, all-region, German-made DVD edition released by Edition Filmmuseum in 2009 is in PAL format.  North American viewers would need a DVD player with PAL-to-NTSC conversion capability.  With a running time of 151 minutes, this is the longest and most complete version of ""The Joyless Street"" to date.  The previous major home video edition was a 1991 laserdisc edition from Kino, and it runs just 94 minutes.  The latest DVD adds footage that improves continuity, restores previously butchered storylines, and restores scenes that further depict the plight of the protagonists, such as the scene where the butcher trades meat for sex, a scene that is truncated and sanitized on older editions such as the one on the Kino laserdisc.

The DVD's picture quality is presentable, but not in the best of shape.  Print damages, unsteady frames, and flickers are quite frequent, due largely to the fact that no original German prints of the film are known to exist, and that inferior foreign prints had to be used for the restoration.

On the DVD publisher's website, restorer Jan-Christopher Horak, one of the people who restored ""The Joyless Street"", writes that the latest restoration as presented on the DVD was only ""a subjective attempt"" due to the fact that the restorers had to use best guesses in overcoming many of the challenges, such as the lack of original German prints, lack of documentation on the original German cut, and the wildly re-edited nature of the many foreign prints of the film.  Horak has written a lengthy, informative article about these challenges, but the article doesn't seem to be on the web anymore.  Fortunately, I have saved a copy.  See my comment section for the link.

The imperfection of this restoration may be the reason why the restored film does not have a wider home video distribution to other regions, such as North America.  This DVD is sold by Munich Filmmuseum's own distribution company, primarily for German viewers.  It can be ordered directly from the website of the distribution company, Edition Filmmuseum, or at Amazon's European sites, such as Amazon UK, Amazon Italy, or Amazon Germany.  The copies sold here at Amazon US are all imported from Europe.  The DVD costs 30 euros, about 40 USD before shipping cost.

The DVD provides reconstructed intertitles in German only, with optional English subtitles.  There is an effective original piano/violin score by Aljoscha Zimmermann.  There is also an option for watching the film without the score.  Zimmermann specializes in silent film scores, and he has also composed scores for other German silents such as the ones for Kino DVD editions of ""Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler"" and ""The Golem"".

The DVD contains several bonus features.  There are about 700 pages of PDF files containing shooting scripts, documents, correspondences, and a souvenir booklet, but all are in German only.  There is an 18-page paper booklet of essays, one in English and the rest in German.  The English essay describes the various attempts of restoration of the film in the past.

There is a very good 111-minute documentary from 1991 called ""Der andere Blick"" (""The Other Eye"") that comes with optional English subtitles.  It recounts the career of Pabst through film clips of his works and interviews of his collaborators, colleagues, family members, and film scholars.  All the interviewees are lit with fairly expressionistic lighting, apparently an homage to Pabst's visual style.  They provide first-hand knowledge on Pabst's early career, his brief stints in Hollywood and France, his reluctant contribution for the Nazi's film industry, and his post-war career in Italy.  Perhaps to emphasize the multi-national paths of Pabst's life, the film has some interviewees speak in multiple languages.  Most of them are perfectly bilingual, although I wish a couple of English speakers would stick to their native language for better intelligibility, especially when English subtitles are provided only for non-English comments.

Another English-subtitled extra is a 20-minute featurette ""Pabst wieder sehen"" that demonstrates some of the work in the film's restoration.  We see restorers repairing sprocket holes, choosing the right tint, and most challengingly, attempting to restore shot sequences that would adhere most closely to the original editing.  This is an all-too-brief featurette that nonetheless gives us a sense of the complexity of the restorers' task.

Also included are about 14 minutes of silent footage of outtakes and alternate takes of the film.  Only 3 scenes are shown, but the alternate takes show us a glimpse of the wildly re-edited nature of the various prints that restorers had to deal with in reconstructing the film.",1372982400,11,6124,5.232581967213115
