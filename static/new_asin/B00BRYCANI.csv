8573171,5,B00BRYCANI,"If you like beach volleyball, you probably have read the books, Sands of Time, The history of beach volleyball, volumes 1-3, by Artie Couvillon. If you have or even if you have not read these books, your gonna love the DVD version of Sands of Time. ""Geeter'  does a great job of narrating the slides how, including his ""Introduction""of beach volleyball, as if he is introducing a player in the finals of an AVP Tour event. Of course the meat and potatoes of the slides how are the photos. There are so many classic beach volleyball photos in volumes 1&2 that you will be astonished. Then, volume 3 showcases all of the modern/current players, in all of their magnificence. Enjoy!",1364774400,,679,4.658333333333333
