8459766,1,B0056LSM9O,"This looks like someone put it together on their computer by splicing a bunch of footage of Arnold.  There is no narration, no information, and it's very short.  I would NOT recommend this product.  It's not a biography.... it's a slideshow.",1478390400,,241,4.829268292682927
8459767,5,B0056LSM9O,It's a straight forward story...I really enjoyed watching it and found it to be entertaining. Great gift idea.,1410134400,,110,5.166666666666667
8459768,1,B0056LSM9O,"This dvd lacked the needed vision of a director and finishing of an editor.  Apparently neither was available to make a lot of old home movies come together.  95% of the film was snippets from Arnold's earlier body building takes.  Some new material there that made it interesting but way too lengthy.  Almost nothing was revealed about Arnold's governaator terms and absolutely no time given to his many other enterprises.  It would have been interesting to see how Arnold manipulated his various ventures and successful enterprises.  He learned how to publicise himself - and was hughly effective.  Some time could have been spent on the courtship and marriage with Maria Schriver, a Democrat.  How did he manage to become governor? What does he do in his spare time?  these are just a few of the critiques one could suggest for such a biography.  Not worth buying nor viewing since nothing new is presented. Save your money and time.",1327190400,,936,4.867088607594937
8459769,1,B0056LSM9O,"Described as ""a revealing and exclusive documentary"", this is mostly just a collection of footage and photos from Arnold's bodybuilding days set to music.  There is very little about Schwarzenegger's movie and political career, let alone the recent scandals--just more photos with some public domain quotes added.  There doesn't even appear to be a narrator!  I don't think that qualifies as a ""documentary"".",1317427200,,408,5.444444444444445
