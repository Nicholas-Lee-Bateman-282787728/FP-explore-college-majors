8754376,1,B01CYNO6L4,"The picture on the cover of this DVD and its implications have absolutely NOTHING to do with this DVD. On the contrary, the DVD is a sloppy compilation of scenes (XXX) that appear to be taken from a VHS tape or a computer without acknowledging the source. The listed director (Grant MacDonald) is non-existent and the would be ""models"" are nameless and uncredited. If you want to see anyone who looks like the picture on the DVD cover, go back in time to Mount or Ancient Olympus. The title itself is a joke. This DVD could give XXX a bad name.",1463875200,,544,4.396039603960396
