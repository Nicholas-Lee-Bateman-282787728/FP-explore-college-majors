8553809,5,B00AMJLONG,"A good perspective and simplified perspective on the Joseph Schumpeter observation that prosperity producing progress comes with the destruction of older products, outdated services and obsolete production models. It even goes into the Austrian perspective (though it does call it that) that this is necessary if the labor and resources are going to be reallocated to the new more efficient uses by the market. My students (HS) liked it and understood it well.

A great sequel would be about who the people are who only see the destruction and not the creation and what motivates them - that was Schumpeter's great observation and revelation.",1365206400,,642,5.173076923076923
