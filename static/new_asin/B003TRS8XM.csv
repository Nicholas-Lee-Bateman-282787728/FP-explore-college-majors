4192672,3,B003TRS8XM,The play loses much of its charm because the production is full of manic performances. Such acting should be done here and there. It is tiring if it is sustained. A play needs variety.,1376092800,5,184,4.4411764705882355
4192673,5,B003TRS8XM,Incredible production at the Globe.  I will try to find and order more of these for the other Shakespeare plays.,1355788800,,112,4.6
4192674,5,B003TRS8XM,Pleased to get the DVD so quickly. Very useful to my work as a theatre artist. It is a delight to get material of this quality at such a reasonable price.,1337385600,,154,4.0
4192675,4,B003TRS8XM,"In London's Bankside district, a recreation of the original Globe Theatre opened in 1997, after years of research and fund-raising. Here the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries are performed in the open air, as they were for Elizabethan audiences, without amplification, and with live musicians. (It's not totally authentic: the female roles are played by women.) The current video, of one of the lesser-known comedies, has been edited from two actual performances; in fact, you can see some morons using their flash cameras during the instrumental prelude. (The groundlings never change.) Standouts among the large cast are Trystan Gravelle, charming as the reluctant scholar Berowne, and Michelle Terry as an imperious princess. Hi-def filming mixes long shots and close-ups effectively, and sound can be ordinary stereo or surround, as you choose. Some of the direction and acting are a bit broad, but it is a very talky show, heavy on wordplay, and with some mock-Latin thrown in. For the home viewer, the clear subtitles are quite helpful in following the text.",1318204800,4,1074,5.25
4192676,4,B003TRS8XM,"I was almost going to give this DVD three stars--but I feel that my inability to really enjoy this production may be a case of Shakespearean snobbism.  What fascinated and delighted me was that this is performed at Shakespeare's Globe in London in 2009.  Shakespeare was written to be performed live.  But with this production the humor is exaggerated to an absurd and, for me, unnatural degree.  Rather than laugh at the Bard's brilliant wit and comic genius, the audience is merely reacting (and thoroughly delighted) by the actor's antics, their grimaces and shrieks.  In the first portion of the play, before the appearances of the women of France, every character is played as clown, unnaturally.  I far prefer the performance in the BBC television production of 1984, under the direction of Elijah Moshinsky.  But it is really unfair to compare a studio production with a live performance.  When I was acting, the audience gave me energy with their response, their laughter and their applause.  The  players in this production all seem very capable, but their performances are marred by their unnatural clownishness, their reaching for laughs that actually detracts from characterization.

The play is wonderful, and this production has many delightful moments.  My favorite performance, remarkably, is that of Seroca Davis as Moth--she seems a genuine wit among so many zanies.  Paul Ready's accent sometimes mars the enunciation of his lines, but he is very funny and quite good as Don Armado.

I think, had I been there in the audience, I would have been charmed by the production in spite of my stuffiness as a Shakespeare purist. I know I would have been enthralled by the dancing and music, by the liveliness of the production as it swept over the audience and won their hearts.  Live performances are a beast all their own.  I have never really enjoyed local live productions of Shakespeare because too many things annoy me: the poor acting, the American dialects that rush lines and loses poetry, and the playing for laughs at questionable points so as to delight an audience and win their favor.  Perhaps, in America, we need such aspects so as to enjoy Shakespeare.  This poet and playwright has adapted through the ages--remarkably.  That audiences still love the plays is cause for celebration.

This DVD comes with a fine booklet of 28 pages filled with photos of the production and an Introduction to and Synopsis of the play.",1316563200,10,2446,4.963144963144964
4192677,5,B003TRS8XM,"The performers in this production are outstanding -- expert comic timing, a superbly natural rendition of these highly poetic lines (if ""natural"" is the right word in this context), and even a wonderful use of stage space that sometimes approaches athleticism.  Production values are excellent; despite its being a live stage show, voices are always well-metered and clear at every volume level, from murmurs to shouts, and the camera angles are apt and imaginative.

These virtues are essential in performance, as the play itself is one of Shakespeare's more challenging for some of us.  The plot is artificial and bare-bones, no great moral issues are touched, and the entertainment value lies almost completely in the rapid-fire wordplay of four couples unexpectedly in love.

A note from my own experience:  More than with some of the plays which seem familiar and straightforward to us (say, Othello, Romeo & Juliet, Much Ado About Nothing), a viewing of this movie is perhaps enhanced by one's having already read through the text.",1312416000,10,1037,5.148809523809524
4192678,5,B003TRS8XM,"Love's Labours' Lost is a play that presents many challenges to a director who wishes to entertain a modern audience while at the same time remaining true to Shakespeare. The Globe has succeeded with an energetic, lively production with the actors and the audience having a rollicking good time. Director Dominic Dromgoole manages to combine an ironic look at serious romantic love and pedantic posturing with rustic clowns and bawdy wordplay.
This play can seem overly wordy to today's audience but in this production, the director introduces an element of comedy into scenes that are often played 'straight'. The eavesdropping scene where the lovers each read their rather less than admirable poems elicits much laughter as the King rolls across the stage to retrieve his dropped poem and the others conceal themselves in various spots on the large stage, even trying to hide among the audience. The content of the poems is lost in the laughter but that does not seem to matter. The verbose schoolmaster Holofernes and his friend Nathaniel are admirably played by Christopher Godwin and Patrick Godfrey. Their Latin phrases and verbosity baffle Dull and the rest of their listeners but the clarity of their diction allows the audience to appreciate Shakespeare's satire of such pedants.
Other notable performances include Paul Ready as Don Armado, a comical braggart with a strong Spanish accent and sad eyes, who concludes the play with: ""You that way; we this way"". Seroca Davis as Moth his page and Fergal McElherron as Costard are also outstanding. Trystan Gravelle, the lord who is immediately critical of the King of Navarre's scheme to spend three years in seclusion studying, has a strong performance as Berowne, although at times his Welsh accent may be strange to the American ear. Michelle Terry as the Princess of France conveys a warmth and intelligence which gives life to a role often played with cool detachment. The only slight disappointment was the Rosaline of Thomasine Rand; although beautiful she lacked the strength to be a worthy foil for Trystan Gravelle.
Music plays a prominent role. Before the play begins, a group of musicians plays period instruments to accompany a mime of courting deer portrayed by life-size puppets. During the intermission, the Princess and her ladies interact with the audience while musicians play. The play concludes with songs for Spring and Winter sung by Jaquenetta and Moth respectively with the whole ensemble joining in for the chorus. In addition, the play is enlivened by the choreography of Sian Williams and John Fensom's costumes in the lush colors of autumn are gorgeous.
Overall, I highly recommend this video. Dromgoole has in the words of Berowne ""made our sport a comedy"".

4192679,4,B003TRS8XM,"Opus Arte's presentation of Dominic Dromgoole's production of William Shakespeare's ""Love's Labour's Lost"" is highly entertaining, and for me, highly recommended.

Firstly, the technical aspects of the disc are very good. The production takes place in a reproduction of Shakespeare's ""The Glode"" theater in which the stage was surrounded by the audience. The disc's sound felt very immersive, placing you in that audience. The video was sharp and clear.

Next, the camera work was excellent, adding a necessary shift of attention from actor to actor, neither just holding one frame too long, nor switching, Michael Bay-like, and intruding on the presentation.

Finally, the production itself is delightful, mixing Shakespeare's most intellectual play with the overtones of a Mack Sennet pie fight. The problems of the ""unfunny clowns"" is here solved.

If you have enjoyed videos of Shakespeare's plays that have ""updated"" the settings (I'm looking at you, ""Romeo+Juliet""), try viewing this production.",1286928000,25,1001,5.565789473684211

8405416,5,B003TRS8XM,"This is simply put tremendous. As my English teacher told me years ago, Shakespeare wrote plays-they are meant to be SEEN, not read. And a stellar production like this makes the Bards work easy to understand. I'm not going to go into a blow by blow plot detail-in short: The king of Navare has decided to expand his mind by swearing off women and dedicating himself to 3 years of study. He gets 3 of his friends to agree to join him. No sooner do they start on their quest than the King of France sends his daughter to him (a marriage would be a good alliance between the 2 countries). The king refuses to admit her to court and the Princess and her 3 ladies in waiting set up their court in tents outside the city walls. Well of course the men fall in love with with women and go to extraordinary lengths to prove their love. One particular scene involves the men reading letters to said ladies declaring their love - each man thinks they are alone in the woods when they do this (and the King accidentally drops his letter). There ensues chaos and great comedy as each man reacts to what one is saying-and the King tries to retrieve his dropped letter. The play ends with the news of the King of France's death and his daughters need to return home. The women cannot respect the men if they break their oath but of course they are all in love too-so an agreed wait time of one year is decided-if they all feel the same at the end of that time marriage may be entertained. The filmed Globe plays are a great way to see Shakespeare. The quality of the acting, the scenery, the music make for an amazing experience. Each play ends with a jig as they ended in Shakespeare's time-the whole cast do a dance and take their bows!  One benefit of this particular edition too is that Opus Arte who released it include a lovely booklet explaining the plot and the Bard himself. And there are subtitles if needed (I know some of the other plays which have been released by Kultur do not have this causing complaints by the hard of hearing). Enjoy this feast-I really did laugh myself silly",1457395200,,2079,4.358247422680412
