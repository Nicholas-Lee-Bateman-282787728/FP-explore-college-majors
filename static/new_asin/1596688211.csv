7799832,5,1596688211,"I did not purchase this video, but borrowed it from the library.  However, I wanted to review it since I was very impressed with it.  Ms. Warg's instructions are thorough and easily understood. The video quality is excellent.  I never felt like I wasn't able to see clearly what she was demonstrating.  What impressed me most was the range of the techniques she covered. Since I am trying to progress in both torch-fired and kiln-fired enameling from books and videos, it has been difficult to find teaching materials that can move me beyond the most basic techniques.  Most of the techniques Warg covers are indeed basic, but she does it in a way that her finished pieces do not look amateurish while including information that ignited my imagination to see taking each technique a step further.  I highly recommend this video for a raw beginner or intermediate enameler who doesn't have access to live instruction.",1495584000,,916,4.877419354838709
7799833,5,1596688211,I just started watching the DVD yesterday and I can tell that it is going to be very helpful to me.  Where I live there are no enameling classes so I am learning on my own.  Being able to watch an expert doing enameling will make it much easier for me to learn good torch firing enameling safety and techniques.,1468800000,,311,4.166666666666667

7799835,5,1596688211,"After working with many jewelry techniques, I wanted to try something different, one being torch firing enamel. When I purchased this DVD I thought it was actually a book so was surprised when just the DVD arrived. That being said, I am SO glad it came as a DVD, not a book, as I learned so much actually watching Pauline demonstrate the basics! You can review each chapter as needed as well as there is a printable page which summarizes tools and supplies. I am excited about trying all of her ideas!!",1427414400,2,502,4.467391304347826
