It's a footage from the play....

Ridiculous !

I was fooled by the ad.

Don't buy this BLURAY.",1392508800,,118,4.0
8577753,5,B00C6NKUOA,"I've listened to a recording of this opera and confess it failed to move me.  However seeing this performance was a revelation.  For me, it captures the mood of Mann's novella - and that is quite a challenge.  This is not an easy story to tell.  The ""action"" is inward, the revelations in the mind of the hero.  The dream-like quality of this drama and the music act as invitations to enter the soul of the protagonist  and what you find there will be measured as much by your own life as his.  This video is a keeper, one I shall be watching again.",1389916800,6,549,4.221153846153846
