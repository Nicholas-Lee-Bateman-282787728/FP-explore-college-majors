Shes is funny and still makes all those wonderful faces. This comedy is not family oriented because of its subjest matter(giving up your child for adoption)",1362528000,,289,4.686274509803922
7910973,4,B00000INCD,"Please check out my remarks about Vol I. Thanks to dear old Mollie Sugden, my smiles evoked by Vol. I turned to audible chuckles in Vol. II. The character of the drunken brother is being fleshed out (at least as much as  such sitcom characters can be) and the feud between the two mothers is  developing nicely from its origins in the earlier episodes. Blake and  Lonsdale are still predictable in their roles; but then again the script  does not allow them any development, sothey do their best with the given  stereotypes: shrill and always going for the Big Laugh. The second episode  in Vol. II concerns Sugden's manipulations to reconcile the couple after a  driving lesson accident tears them apart; and here the script gets an  almost clever twist in Mollie's plan to save the marriage. The next episode  abut dieting is funny because Sugden makes it funny and the O'Henry ending  is quite good because it is unexpected. So now for the final Volume.",942451200,3,956,4.704819277108434
