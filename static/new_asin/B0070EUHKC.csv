5046305,5,B0070EUHKC,"WOW!!! good movie for the most part some of the dialogue was stupid BUT the end will have your mouth hanging on the floor. This is a must see movie, it's not scary but it's watchable.",1505520000,,183,4.111111111111111

5046307,5,B0070EUHKC,"Sam and Janice move into their first home, and wind-up receiving the unexpected. As the couple talks to their neighbors, they find out disturbing news about a past owner named Isabelle, who in a jealous rage killed her husband and his lover in that house. Worst of all, it's nearly fifty years later, and Janice suddenly begins to sleep walk. She can also see visions of a woman and blood everywhere. Has Isabelle returned, and who is killing people in the neighborhood? This is a fright night delight for all thriller and mystery lovers.

5046309,5,B0070EUHKC,"The plot unwinds sort of cool, but I think the best part is the editing and some really interesting fresh story development.",1337126400,2,124,4.681818181818182
5046310,1,B0070EUHKC,"Please don't waste your money on this, unless you are interested in learning about really bad amateur film.  Hopefully it was good practice for everyone involved so they can do better next time, but this project should not have been released for sale. I wish them the best in future projects, but I also wish I could get my 3.99 back.",1335830400,5,334,4.475409836065574
5046311,5,B0070EUHKC,"Can't wait to get my hands on this one. I plan a dinner party review as soon as I receive it. Friends are so excited to view it. I'll even throw in for the dinner and popcorn!!! Job well done, Chris Soth and team.",1331596800,2,213,3.8636363636363638
8507721,2,B0070EUHKC,"Not terrible, but it was a bit boring at times. Suppose the twist was okay (assuming I understood it - I wasn't paying as much attention as the movie progressed). Might be worth a watch for some folks though just expect low budget",1528675200,,230,4.372093023255814
8507722,3,B0070EUHKC,"This movie was okay.  Again, just a typical low budget horror film.  The story was good enough to keep me interested to watch until the end but it was a bit weird.  I can't really give this a recommendation unless you have Prime and don't have to pay for it.  Not worth the money.",1524787200,,280,4.12962962962963
8507723,3,B0070EUHKC,Hard to watch at first but hung in there and was glad I did.  Nice couple of twists going for it.  Didn't care for any of the characters at all but the plotting was worth the watch.,1511654400,,181,3.864864864864865
8507724,2,B0070EUHKC,Not a good movie at all. The twist in the movie was unexpected but that's about it that was good.,1508025600,,97,3.9
8507725,2,B0070EUHKC,"Videography is too white and bright, like wedding footage. Not at all a horror feeling. Only made it 20 minutes in.",1507075200,,115,4.523809523809524

8507727,2,B0070EUHKC,"I made it about fifteen minutes in and started to nod off. Considering I'd been awake for little over two hours, that really saying something for the somnambulistic properties of this film. Boring film with bad acting.",1506816000,,218,4.918918918918919
8507728,3,B0070EUHKC,This is not bad for a B Movie. Some of the acting is a bit wooden and the plot is for teenagers who want to know about 20 something sex and be scared of it!,1506643200,,156,3.4857142857142858
8507729,4,B0070EUHKC,"I actually liked this movie haha. Didn't think I would based on the reviews. I mean, for the type of film, I liked the plot. The ending really surprised me, nice twist. Acting wasn't terrible. If you have an hour and 15 minutes to kill, check it out. You might like it too :)",1506470400,,275,4.111111111111111
