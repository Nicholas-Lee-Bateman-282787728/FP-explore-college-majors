8705885,4,B00UGPOTX8,"Caught in the Draft is a typical war-time comedy with Bob Hope the same as he is in all of his movies. Dorothy Lamour isn't the best actress, but she does well in this film. The film is fast-moving and funny and a good way to pass the time for 90 minutes.

Give Me a Sailor features two brothers who want to marry the same girl, and one brother plots a scheme with the girls unattractive sister to squelch his brothers romance. This is a funny, first-rate comedy. Hope, Raye, and Grable are all in top form, but Martha Raye shines in this film. She was a great actress and comedienne and was actually the star of this picture. Engaging and entertaining. Youll enjoy this film.",1472688000,,676,4.365079365079365
