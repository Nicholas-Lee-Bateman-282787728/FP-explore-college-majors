7554371,4,B018TA0TEE,"MIDWINTER OF THE SPIRIT, a British supernaturally tinged thriller, is an ITV-produced television serial based on the popular novels by Phil Rickman.  The three episode crime drama stars the very-popular-on-ourTV-screens- these-days two-time BAFTA award winning Anna Maxwell Martin, (THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE, DEATH COMES TO PEMBERLEY) as recently-relocated-to-the-country vicar Merrily Watkins.  Merrily is in training to be an exorcist, or deliverance minister, for the Church of England. In this undertaking, she is guided by the sardonic, no-nonsense Reverend Huw Owen (the long-admired BAFTA winning David Threlfall, SHAMELESS, HOT FUZZ). But Merrily must contend with self-doubt in her tough new role. Her faith had been deeply shaken by her husbands recent death and concurrent revelations about his unfaithful behavior. She is struggling to raise her rebellious teenage daughter on her own, trying to tend to a dying churchman  haunted by an evil spirit. Merrily has not even unpacked before the Hereford police call her in to consult on a grisly local murder, a crucified Satanist.  The inexperienced exorcist, one of the few women priests working as an exorcist in the UK, finds herself battling supernatural terrors.  This dark British mystery also stars Kate Dickie (Game of Thrones), Nicholas Pinnock (Fortitude), Leila Mimmack (Mayday), Siobhan Finneran (Downton Abbey), and Ben Bailey Smith (Law & Order: UK).

The box set, which I received for review purposes, consists of a single disc, with three episodes following upon each other. It has a photo gallery and subtitles, for those of us not up on our Hereford dialect.  It also contains coarse language, disturbing images, graphic violence, nudity and sexual situations. Not for children, obviously.  Also probably not for the sensitive or the deeply religious.  The production was filmed in Herefordshire, features Hereford cathedral and The Litchfield Vaults public house nearby. The countryside is always lovely.  The acting is always very good, even when the script gets a little silly. The entertainment can be chilling; it delivers spine-tingling rollercoaster thrills and chills galore, as they used to say, lightened by some funny moments. We are certainly not believers in the supernatural in this house, nevertheless, we found ourselves gripped by the story, and binge-watched it through to the end.",1458259200,13,2372,5.527624309392265
7554372,4,B018TA0TEE,"Fine acting leads save this thriller series pitting a vicar against all things evil. Script lags a bit behind the acting level of the cast. A Satanic crucifixion murder has police seeking explanations of events through the Church of England. Terror implemented through frequent sudden scene changes, loud noises, imaged nightmares, and grotesque gargoyle-like Zombie creatures. Seasoned cast members make much of the story characters believable. My personal strong Christian faith likely hampered acceptance of several cultish scenes.

STRONG NOTEWORTHY CAST members: Merrily (Anna Maxwell Bletchley Circle, South Riding, Philomena); troubled Rowenna and Boy Bishop James (Leila Mimmack & Will Attenborough both from Homefires, and thats worth a look); Angela (Siobhan Finneran Downton Abbey); Huw (David Threlfall Dinner of Herbs, a delightful Catherine Cookson adaptation); and a debut gig by Sally Messham as the Vicars daughter.
Due to content, not recommended for children, anyone with mental health issues, and Christian Fundamentalists (who will be offended.)

SDH SUBTITLES provided as an option, 3 episodes in one continuous story
1 ===Merrily, widow, vicar of 3 months, trains in exorcism from another church leader, Huw. Merrily helps police investigate a crucifixion. Last rites to another dying man leaves Merrily less than merry, increasingly troubled. Her daughter, Jane, struggles over her dads accidental death.
2 ===Is Canon Dobbs's (David Sterne Detectorists) death suicide or murder? Why is a dead crow on a church altar? Merrily attempt a first exorcism. Is Janes friend under social worker care, Rowenna, involved in cult sacrifices related to centuries-old lore?
3 ===Jane runs away after another family spat. Is Rowenna involved? The history of the desecrated church may provide clues to murder and evil events. Compelling ending in a dark suspense-thriller miniseries.
Got to admit at the end I jumped out of my seatnot good for a fellow with heart issues.
Dark Halloween horror film fans will like Midwinter of the Spirit.",1456185600,8,2048,5.539936102236422
7554373,4,B018TA0TEE,"There are three starts to the show. First, we see Canon Dobbs reciting Latin at the hospital bedside of Denzil Joy. There is desperation and fear written on Dobbs' face  and blood starts flowing from his nose as he holds his cross up to the man in the bed.

Next, in the dead of night, Paul Sayers runs through a forest, fleeing for his life. To no avail, as he's surrounded by his black-garbed pursuers. Then all we hear is his scream.

Lastly, a group of Anglican clergy stand in the small room of a house. Reverend Huw Owen is their tutor in the skills needed for a Deliverance Ministry, otherwise known as exorcism. Huw tells them, ""Deliverance Ministry requires a wide skill set, part social work, part counselling, lots of listening.""
That's because you have to rule out every other possible cause before settling on a spiritual one  that of possession. ""The bottom line is this. Your job is to protect people from the intrusion into their lives of entities which half the professed Christians in this country don't believe in.""

One of Huw's students is Vicar Merrily Watkins. She's only been in this community for three months. She's an escapee. Escaping the big city for the country. Escaping the pain of a husband who cheated on her. A single mother to a 15 year-old daughter and the magnified griefs between them.

She is horrified when the police take her out to the blasphemous scene of Sayers' death. They want to know, is this a cult death? Merrily's interactions with the police can be interesting, as they are coming at the evidence from totally different perspectives. The cops know there are no demons. Merrily knows there are demons. How the twain shall meet?

""Midwinter of the Spirit"" originally aired in October 2015. It consists of three episodes totaling 145 minutes viewing. The DVD is presented in 16:9 widescreen and stereo sound. English SDH subtitles are available.

The DVD has only one bonus extra, a 2 minute Photo Gallery. It's too bad they didn't arrange a little interview with Phil Rickman, author of the book (of the same name) on which the series is based.

Trivia:  If I'm remembering correctly, the story's location is not even mentioned in the TV series. In the book, it takes place in Hereford, Herefordshire.  And the series was actually filmed in Herefordshire, including the awe-inspiring 936 year-old Hereford Cathedral. It's the home of the Mappa Mundi and the Chained Library, of which even I have heard.

This exorcism genre is not usually my cup of tea, and I'm glad I watched the series doing the day, as parts did creep me out. Demons and such have been done so many times that it may be difficult to seem totally original, so there is melodrama. Because it is a TV show, there is less blood and gore than the usual horror movie. But it makes up for it with suspense and creepiness. There are some good characterizations, especially Huw Owen. And Merrily is very much not the stalwart hero. She is fragile and distracted which makes her three-dimensional even as she's sometimes annoying.

Happy Reader",1454544000,8,3055,4.741509433962264

8742909,4,B018TA0TEE,Wasn't quite as good as the wonderful book series by Phil Rickman.  It covered all the basic points of the book.  I will purchase subsequent movies in this series if they come out with them.,1483920000,,190,4.4
8742910,1,B018TA0TEE,"Once again unforgiveable liberties have been taken with a book to create sensationalistic but ridiculous results. Admitedly I am a fan of Phil Rickman's non-merrily novels (can not for the life of me figure out why he decided to write a series based on his weakest and most unlikable character, but here it is.) so I will state that if network television is going to butcher his novels at least they aren't messing with his best work.

Midwinter of the spirit was not the greatest of literary or even paranormal work but it was tremendously better than this hot mess of an adaptation. The entire premise of the novel was thrown out to literally focus on and grotesquely expand on a subplot from the original story. And if you thought Merrily was a short bus ride in the novels the producers here decided to make it abundantly clear why this woman is one of the worst ever created by instilling a level of hysteria that the original Merrily is too dim-witted to reach in the novels. I honestly can not believe the actress agreed to this job. She is does well in other projects so she can't be hurting for work. And Phil Rickman is a fool if he isn't doing everything he can to prevent this kind of butchery from happening to the rest of his books in the future.",1478217600,,1260,4.454545454545454
8742911,4,B018TA0TEE,"Hope they intend to do more of this series. There are a lot of novels with the Merrily Watkins character, and I think Anna Maxwell Martin is a great choice of actress.",1473552000,,167,4.25
8742912,1,B018TA0TEE,"I wanted to like this adaptation.  About halfway through episode 2 I was hoping there would be another season.  Then the second half happened and I couldn't wait for this to end.  The writing disintegrated into tedious, formulaic drivel.  Anna Maxwell Martin is an exceptional actor and I have always enjoyed her work.  I don't understand why she accepted so demeaning a role.  In 2015 are we still supposed to accept women as so prone to emotion that they can't act with reason and logic.  The writers seemed to feel that that was their only available vehicle to squeeze out a third episode.  Add in ""rebellious teenager"" formula and you've got another 45 minutes of ""drama"".  It's embarrassing.  Don't waste your time.  Read the book.  It's a little better.",1472169600,3,759,4.7984496124031
8742913,5,B018TA0TEE,"The scariest thing Ive seen in quite awhile is not IT FOLLOWS nor THE INVITATION or UNDER THE SKIN, but this blooming miniseries from jolly old England which we watched on Acorn TV, a streaming service I never thought myself capable of patronizing but never say never because now here we are.  It started with us watching THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE, the series set in Cold War England in which a bunch of disaffected housewives find themselves dreaming of their wartime service as invaluable cryptologists and licked Hitler, and the one main girl was played by Anna Maxwell Martin.  Shes a funny actress, with expressive eyes that nevertheless seem set too painfully close to the surface.  She was riveting in the first season of BLETCHLEY, though in season 2 the producers pulled a low trick and managed to hire her for a cameo in an early episode and then you never heard from her again, for it was So long girls, solve all the crimes on your own but Im too famous now to help, though Ill be thinking of you, ta.

Then we saw Anna Maxwell Martin pop up briefly at the beginning of the recent BBC version of Agatha Christies And Then There Were None.  She played one of the two servants of the deserted island mansion, and was soon done in, but while she was alive and trembling and radiating I know too much she was riveting.  Then my wife caught wind of an exorcist miniseries in which Anna Maxwell Martin was going to be playing a clerical part and an exorcist!  Didnt know they have female exorcists but why not, especially in England.  And they don't call them exorcists, thats passe I guess.  What they do is perform deliverance work.  What?  It was tough going in knowing that her name in the show was Reverend Merrily Watkins.  For the way she comes across on screen, she has never done anything merrily in her life.  She has been used and abused by a cheating former husband that she cannot forgive or forget, and now her exorcism coach is scorning her in a sexist Welsh wayhis name is Huw Owensaying only men can do this work, women are vulnerable to Satan.  Plus she has a teen daughter who despises her and a bishop who has sort of a God crush on her.

The spookiest things start happening as she takes up her new job at Hereford Cathedral.  First a man gets crucified in the woods, and then an old reprobate is lying sick in hospital, sick and evil, and a girl is caught with her hand under his bedclothes making the jerking motions nurses associate with a common sexual practice.  Merrily comes to visit this sick old creep and he comes out of his coma and attacks her with his long Howard-Hughes fingernails, dirty as goats hooves, stabbing right into her palm so she gets infected.  Now that is a hideous ruse.  But we soon detect this as part of a larger systemic pattern directed at Merrily herself, and her brat daughter, as well as at Jesus Christ.  Whos behind this?  Who?  I won't spoil any secrets of the three part serial, but let me just, in the wise words of Dory Previn, advise you to Beware of Young Girls.  The show is honestly super frightening and some good acting overcomes the hard to swallow byzantine complexity of the storyline.  Watch it with someone you care about who doesnt mind if you clutch them tight in fright!",1471824000,2,3249,4.48639455782313
8742914,5,B018TA0TEE,Wonderfully written and acted.  Interesting theme.,1468972800,,50,7.333333333333333
8742915,3,B018TA0TEE,"This series has a lot to recommend it but for me it was a feeling I've seen it all before so there wasn't that much of a bling. I do love these small Brit who-done-its but this one was just maybe 3.5 stars if I could give it that. Anna Maxwell Martin does a good job as always as a now-veteran of many good Brit shows and the rest of the cast isn't bad either. The character development is pretty good but the storyline a little weak and disjointed at times.

A woman, now a Vicar, and daughter move to a smaller town after her husband dies. Based on her training and experience she is called upon to help the police sort out some antichrists or something running around town. Side stories about her and other characters are slowly reveal to culminate in the end.",1465948800,,763,4.2620689655172415
8742916,4,B018TA0TEE,"I had high hopes for this British mini-series about a new Anglican exorcist (who is a widow with a teenager) mentored by an old codger Priest.
Unfortunately, although it had some interesting moments---it devolved into an unsatisfying ending that was not believable---acting and production values (as is often the case in these BBC productions) first rate.",1463270400,,355,5.357142857142857
8742917,5,B018TA0TEE,"I've just watched Midwinter of the Spirit and I couldn't wait to share it with friends who appreciate what we call ""chillers"".  I think we get so used to films that rely on grotesque visuals to generate fear, that we forget that suspense and what we imagine is going to happen can be even more frightening.  In this story Merrily Watkins (Anna Maxwell Martin)  a Church of England priest, is in training to be a ""deliverance"" minister, an exorcist (feel creepy already?)  She is taught and mentored in this endeavor  by Reverend Huw Owen (David Threlfall) whose crustiness and unsympathetic demeanor seems to indicate a lack of faith in Merrily's ability to master the deliverance technique.  While on her rounds as vicar, Merrily is called to the death bed of one of her parish.  This man has the reputation of being evil, and as he dies while Merrily is praying for his soul, she witnesses an unexplained change in the corpse.  From that moment on, Merrily is drawn deeper into mystery and past evils of this man and of the area.  Anna Maxwell Martin is a superb actress,and takes viewers down the path that Merrily follows. Bit by bit we feel with her the sense of growing evil, of things that are unreal coming to life, and the question as to the strength of her faith to combat it all.  Wonderfully atmospheric, and riddled with unseen but certainly felt animosity the story progresses to a point where even a sunny day seems overcast.  There is a claustrophobic fear that nothing can release the good from evil's grasp.",1462233600,,1525,4.674157303370786
