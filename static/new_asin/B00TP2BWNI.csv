8702445,5,B00TP2BWNI,My child and I thoroughly enjoyed this together. Great cast. Fun take on some important subjects. Good conversation starter. Sadly MTV cancelled it.,1530489600,,148,5.478260869565218
8702446,5,B00TP2BWNI,"This show, however brief, was a major breakthrough in highlighting the struggles of the LGBTG Teen community.  Especially because it used humor to deliver the message but not in any mean-spirited way.  I think all teens and anyone that lived thru their teens, can relate to aspects of this show.  The two lead actresses, Rita Volk and Katie Stevens were perfect for their roles.  I can't imagine anyone else playing their characters.  The rest of the cast were also excellent.  A lot of credit also goes to the writers.  I've got to believe that they must have also been a diverse group to hit it so correctly.  I hope that someday another network will pick up the show or even make a full length film.",1494115200,,702,4.56
8702447,5,B00TP2BWNI,One of the greatest LGBTQ shows out there. You do not want to miss it.,1454716800,,70,3.7333333333333334
8702448,4,B00TP2BWNI,I would have given 5 stars but the listing states that the DVD's are unrated as opposed to the TV-14 rating the TV broadcast recieves. This is the reason for the bleeps that are quite frequent and incredibly annoying to me. I'd rather have the language unfiltered since my children are 9 and 10 so they aren't allowed to watch this program anyway.,1451260800,,347,4.523809523809524
8702449,1,B00TP2BWNI,Product came broken. Dvds were completely scratched and floating around inside of case.,1451001600,,87,5.769230769230769
8702450,5,B00TP2BWNI,"This is my absolute favorite show! the only reason I haven't bought this, is because I'm waiting for them to release ALL of season 2! Sop hurry up MTV/Amazon!",1447459200,2,158,4.482758620689655
8702451,5,B00TP2BWNI,"I was so excited for the return of this show after the shocking season finale. And I'm so glad it's back! The greatness that season 1 had is still present in season 2, the comedy, the drama... ""Faking It"" is a guilty pleasure that still delivers laughs, a solid storyline and great performances (love Rita, Katie and Michael).
So far, the season has been so great, there's more seriousness this time (Lauren's revelation), but ""Faking It"" still knows when to be funny and when to be serious. I hope this show lasts so much more, it's a guilty pleasure and maybe too good for MTV. Can't wait to see how the story unfolds, because I always want more! 20 minutes are not enough. I wish it was 40 minutes long!",1424217600,8,706,4.438461538461539
