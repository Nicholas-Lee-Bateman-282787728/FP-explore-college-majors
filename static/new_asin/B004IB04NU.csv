4385951,5,B004IB04NU,"Without Ernie Kovacs, there probably never would have been a David Letterman, a Conan O'Brien, or SNL.  Unlike others of his era that saw TV as radio with pictures, Kovacs viewed the medium as a frontier.
And Kovacs roamed over every inch of it, testing how far the medium could go visually and intellectually. Consider when watching these videos that he was doing experiments with television that people like Conan O'Brien are still working on.  Characters like the effete poet Percy Dovetonsils or the antics of the gorilla jazz musicians The Nairobi Trio manage to retain a cutting edge, ""I did not just see that!"" sort of feel; all the more amazing when it is considered that his television peers were Sid Caesar, George Burns, and Ozzie Nelson.  He was an abstract comic artist in a baroque era.",1294704000,21,800,4.782608695652174

4385954,5,B004IB04NU,I can't wait to get this collection. I wish someone would release all of the Coke Time Shows that were made by singer Eddie Fisher in the 1950's. Great shows. I have some but would love to have the complete collection. If you want to see some go to the Facebook and type in Wish You Were Here. I put some nice clips of Eddie singing there.,1455667200,,339,4.074626865671642

4385956,2,B004IB04NU,"I've heard that there are several Ernie Kovacs performances generally missing during a time when shows were being erased from tapes, and that his wife Edie Gourmet did her best to save as many as possible, but this is not how I remember him at all. I have another Kovacs DVD in which I am similarly disillusioned. I remember him as a great performer as well, but something seems to be missing in these shows. I remember him doing several variety shows with other performers, plus the monkeys. But these are not spotlighted in these several disks.",1448409600,,546,4.639175257731959
4385957,2,B004IB04NU,"I found confirmation that most of the Musical Numbers WERE Edited Out of these DVDs because they didn't even bother to get the clearances!  So the best, most memorable sketches Ernie did were edited out because they didn't even TRY???

FROM A REVIEW SITE:
""Shout! is up front on every disc that musical numbers have been edited out for clearance purposes.""

HOW did the producers of ""THE ERNIE KOVACS RECORD COLLECTION"" CD get clearances for all 20 Tracks? But they couldn't get ANY for the DVD??? I agree with the other reviewers... That's just wrong.

(By the way, that's the all time best Incredibly Strange Lounge Music CD.)

These are the tracks on the Ernie Kovacs Record Collection CD.  Part of the Ernie Kovacs genius was that they did extremely early music videos that were fascinating or hilarious, or both.  Without this music, these DVDs are incomplete...

4385964,4,B004IB04NU,"So fascinating watching Kovacs exploring what tv could be at a time when it could have gone in a hundred different directions. A few of the improvs fall flat but some land brilliantly. He wasn't afraid to fail, and his willingness to try anything in front of a camera sending him into people's living rooms live makes watching him a little bit of an adventure.",1410998400,,360,4.553846153846154

Thanks!",1407974400,,238,3.836734693877551
4385967,5,B004IB04NU,What a pleasure to watch Ernie Kovacs again. His early-television style is creative and interesting to watch. Especially like Percy Dovetonsils and the Nairobi Trio.,1405555200,,165,5.64

4385969,5,B004IB04NU,"Ernie Kovacks was well ahead of his time and produced some of the best television in the fiftys and early sixties till his death. Some of his skits remind me of early NBC David Letterman. Completely off the wall and silly. The first couple od DVD's are agonizing to watch only because the networks struggled to fill airtime and I guess TV was such a novelty, people would tune in to watch a test pattern. Overall this is a great collection and an important part of TV history.",1404172800,,476,4.420454545454546
4385970,5,B004IB04NU,"I gave this as a Christmas present to a brother who truly loves the classic comedians from TV's Golden Age. He said the routines were incredible and Ernie Kovacs is one of the most imaginative and hilarious comedy performers he has ever seen. He was delighted to have the DVDs of his routines. Some of Ernie's comedy writing laid the groundwork for many routines we have today. I think he is a much-missed performer. It was a much-appreciated gift. Thank you, Amazon!

4385971,5,B004IB04NU,"Ernie Kovacs was a genius. If you remember watching him (PBS ran some of the old shows in recent years) or you are a newcomer to this comedian, you will suddenly see that many jokes comedian's use today are direct desendents of Ernie's funny brain and delivery.  He was ahead of his time, I wonder if people back then even ""got"" his jokes, they probably thought he was weird when you watch his collection of skits, his perfect delivery & timing, and his wardrobe used throughout his shows.  I hope his estate gets to release all his material that still exists, heard that some of it is lost forever by network exec's who erased some tapes to reuse for other's projects.",1390953600,3,669,4.520661157024794

4385983,5,B004IB04NU,"They say it's better to give than to  receive, and that's certainly true of advice (not to mention criticism). There's much to be said for receiving, however, though it does depend on what you're taking possession of, as head lice and similarly nasty transferrable things are hard to appreciate. Still, there's nothing like getting stuff you really like or have always wanted (e.g., a pole saw). ""Oh, what joy and what surprise/When I open up my eyes/And see a telescopable pole saw/Standing there!""

I did get that pole saw one Christmas, and this Christmas I got something else I've always wanted: a gravy-grease separator! Unless you've been gifted with one yourself, you can't imagine the delight of unwrapping one.

I also got an orange beret, which is something else I've long desired. You see, I have a large collection of berets in almost every color -- except pink and white, which I would not wear under any circumstances -- but orange was not among them. And I like orange. Yes, I know it's not ""my color."" It's a fall color and I'm a winter, supposedly: only blacks and grays and dark blues for me. Which is okay, because black is my favorite color, anyway, even though it isn't one. Still, occasionally, perversely, I get this overwhelming urge to wear a fall color like brown or tan or -- orange! Why would I want to wear an orange beret? To keep my head warm, you idiot! (Didn't see that one coming, did you?)

And I also got collections of crossword puzzles, wine and spirits, and a nice Fijian shirt. If you don't know the difference between a Hawaiian shirt and a Fijian shirt, you're a complete ignoramus and can join my club. (I'll let the members know when I figure it out.)

But the absolute best thing I got for Christmas was the Ernie Kovacs Collection. I can't even imagine how much fun I'm going to have watching the antics of this crazy knucklehead who died, way too young, when I was still a kid. In a mad, mad, mad, mad world, laughter is the only thing that keeps the sane people sane.",1356652800,,2015,4.55524861878453
4385984,5,B004IB04NU,This set of programs is a must for film or media library collections. Our faculty are very pleased that it is now available to support their classes.,1349654400,,149,4.555555555555555
4385985,5,B004IB04NU,"This collection of material from Ernie Kovacs television shows is by no means complete. There are full episodes of his NBC morning show, (which were rerunned on Comedy Central during its infancy) probably a few NBC evening shows and definitely a couple of the ABC evening specials. That aside, you do get a heck of a lot with this set.

What you do get is a great summation of Ernie Kovacs television career from his early local afternoon (early evening) show in Philadelphia straight to the end with his ABC Specials (the intimate vacuum). Included are more than a few skits featuring Percy Dovetonsils, also great bits like Trapizza, Superclod and two versions of the classic Eugene. There is some overlapping. I am guessing because Ernie was bouncing around from station to station and likely never dreamnt that people born almost 20 years after his death would love to watch his show (me), some of his bits were used for the ABC, NBC and local shows. I remember seeing this with Eugene and a couple of other bits which were used for NBC then again in the ABC Specials. That isn't to say the set is still great because it is. (5 stars are posted for a reason).

The extras for me are almsot as enjoyable as the general content.

The Baseball Film with two different commentaries is excellent. The Mysterious Knockwurst is a kooky silent film which is a bit of a relic that Edie Adams didn't even realize she owned throughout the years. The trailers for Operation Madball, and It Happened to Jane are classic Ernie. The home movies, commericals and a pair of great interviews from George Schlatter and Jolene Brand round out this great collection.

To those complaining about this set. Please read that this is THE ERNIE KOVACS COLLECTION and NOT THE COMPLETE ERNIE KOVACS COLLECTION. Support this set with your money and maybe with a few emails from us too few fans of Kovacs will convince Shout! to get the rights to the missing ABC Specials and release them with some additional shows in a brand new set for us all to enjoy.",1340755200,2,2029,4.6434540389972145
4385986,3,B004IB04NU,"This humorous collection gives a good overview of Kovacs' comedy, but it is far from being a complete collection.

4385987,4,B004IB04NU,"For Kovacs/Adams fans, this is one of the best collections you will find. It is a wayback machine, from the early 1950s to the 1960s. Hours of entertainment, hours of bonus content.

But even though I strongly recommend this set, it's not for everybody, for two main reasons:

1) Much of it is ""experimental TV"" for the 1950s, which means that a lot of people won't find it funny and won't ""get it"". I'm an avid Kovacs fan, but even I found some of the skits worthy of fast-forwarding.

2) Most of the musical numbers by guests were edited out, due to prohibitive copyright/royalty costs. So instead of today's viewers getting to see 1950s entertainment, idiotic and completely unfair COPYRIGHT laws demand that these skits...be forgotten and never seen again.

I'm grateful to have this set, and Shout! deserves 5 stars for the compilation on multiple DVDs, and especially for the booklet inside.",1332115200,,897,4.8431372549019605
4385988,5,B004IB04NU,"Part child-like prankster and part hipster satyr, Ernie Kovacs would have been a significant part of early television history had he only stayed a host of his funny, ad-libbed chat shows. However, Kovacs' ambition drove him into the realm of television auteur where his fascination with the technological possibilites of TV informed his visual slapstick with a surrealistic weirdness that has never been duplicated. He is truly television's first genius, and Shout! Factory has done him proud with this amazing boxed set of over thirteen hours of his little-seen work. It is must-have viewing for anyone interested in the evolution of television, comedy and American pop culture during the mid-20th century.",1321142400,,707,5.378378378378378
4385989,5,B004IB04NU,"I used have (and nearly wore out) a VHS copy of ""The Best of Ernie Kovacs."" When this DVD set came out I jumped on it! I am so pleased that Edie Adams had the foresight to save all the material that otherwise network television would have ultimately scrapped.

Most intriguing for me are the earliest shows. Since Ernie was on television in it's infancy, and a few years before I was born, the shows from the mid-1950s were all new to me and very funny, free-wheeling zaniness. The way he played with the camera, the sets, recovered from gags that didn't go right on live TV, all made me admire his comic brain even more. He's been called a genius and these shows will remind you why.

A wonderful collection for any Kovacs fan!",1320105600,,728,4.385185185185185
4385990,4,B004IB04NU,"I just received this a few days ago and, having gone through all the discs to see what there is to see, I thought it would be useful to compare this with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-Ernie-Kovacs/dp/B000056B07/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of Ernie Kovacs</a>&nbsp;from WhiteStar (although that one is apparently out-of-print and fetching ""collector's"" prices now).

Both sets have great material and die-hards will want both (there is some overlap, but I'm pretty sure it amounts to less than one disc's worth).  This set is more comprehensive in that it covers a broader swath of Ernie's career and does so in a relatively systematic way.  This set also presents complete shows (or nearly so - there's a disclaimer on all of the discs that music rights were too expensive so musical numbers have often ben cut) so you get a better feel for what the shows were really like.  That's a double-edged sword, though.

I think the WhiteStar set has a greater concentration of high-quality material.  All of the best stuff is on there (it really is the ""Best Of"") and unfortunately I don't think the same can be said for this set.  There's lots and lots of great stuff here, but there's also a fair amount of mediocre material as well.

What with the questionable availability of the WhiteStar set, you'll have to weigh costs and so on, but ideally that's the place to start.  If you then find that you're in love with the man, this set is a great follow-up.  If the other set isn't available or it's too expensive, then this set will certainly deliver the goods.

BTW - if you're new to Ernie and starting with this set, I'd suggest you start with Discs 5 & 6 to see what he was doing at his peak - the earlier material might well strike you (as it clearly has some other reviewers) as lacklustre and unfocused.  Once you get pulled into Ernie's world, I would hope you'll come to appreciate the relaxed and casual goofiness that those early shows represent.

As an odd digression I'd like to draw a parallel between Ernie and George Herriman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krazy-Kat/dp/1560973862/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krazy Kat</a>.  They both seem to come from slower-paced and more gentle times.  This means, for me, that with each of them I usually need to immerse myself in that world for a little while before I slow down and settle in.  Only then can I really appreciate the more delicate flavors of either.  So my suggestion is that you give Ernie (and Krazy) some time to draw you in, to make friends and to transport you to their own goofy worlds.  It's well-worth the trip.",1317772800,12,2691,5.049773755656108
4385991,5,B004IB04NU,"This collection is, in my opinion, essential for students of the television medium.  Kovacs was a true  pioneer.  He was one of the first to understand that television is different from motion pictures: you are entertaining one viewer (or a few), not a theater audience, and can take him/her into your confidence.  This collection explores his contributions quite well. The curator of the Kovacs archive, silent-movie maven Ben Model, deserves great credit for his  choices.
Ernie's wife and collaborator, Edie Adams, was a Juilliard-trained singer and helped Ernie get into classical music; here she sings (e.g.) Villa-Lobos' ""Bachianas Brazileiras No. 5"" beautifully. Look for the ballet treatments (unorthodox and uproarious) of works ranging from Bartok to Tchaikovsky.

I'm not talking about the songs cut because of licensing issues, I'm talking about clips like ""Musical Office"", one of Kovac's best-known - I'd would have preferred that to the ""News report with Leroy L. Leroy"", which goes on WAY too long and isn't particularly funny.  Also, the only time we see the famous 'pat the car on the fender and it falls through the floor' gag is in a special feature interview, talking about how expensive that gag was, and not standing alone or as part of an episode.  Why?  If these other clips are available, why aren't they in the collection?  I can't believe what's here is all there is.",1314921600,3,782,4.63768115942029

I've been fascinated with Ernie Kovacs since the PBS specials in, what was it, 1977?
Who was this strange man and why is he so funny.  I eventually picked up the biography by David Waley, bought the video tapes, and more or less marveled at someone who actually ahead of everyone else's time (not his own time, of course-he was right on time).

Imagine my glee when I read that there was to be an official boxed set.  Once again, fascinating! I finally get to see examples of the Philadelphia show, the game shows, and the network extravaganzas I had only read about up to that point.  There were more examples of Percy Dovetonsils (that should be a set on it's own) and whole shows that put the sketches used in the PBS shows into context.

I would recomend getting the DVD's of the aforementioned PBS specials; sure there are duplications, but there are things that aren't included in the box set. But, enough of that.

I am told that 600 hours of stuff sitting in a vault.  Get this set so they'll release more.

thanks for listening",1312329600,2,1043,4.481481481481482

I grew up with this guy's programs starting in the early 50s, so I know what he did and what he was capable of doing.

Instead, it looks like a compilation of what was left over after all the other collections and compilations were released.  I'm sure that that the legal restrictions placed on the production of this collection were great and very limiting, but he gave you so much to choose from.  What happened to the shows from the early 50s?  They were some of his most creative and extemporaneous, but no hint of that talent here.  Where was the Nairobi Symphony (not early 50s)?  what about EEFMS? And Choco-spin?

4385999,5,B004IB04NU,"Shout it out!
  Shout! Factory has released The Ernie Kovacs Collection, 780 minutes of perhaps the only genius television has ever produced. Ernie Kovacs has been praised so much, during his lifetime and after his untimely death, in 1962, in a car crash, that it would be impossible to add anything.
  Kovacs was not a populist entertainer; he was far more a darling of the critics than audiences. He seldom, if ever performed live, much preferring the control of a studio. And he suffered immense pain, the result of his first wife, severely mentally unstable, and grueling their custody battles for their two daughters.
  However, in terms of creativity and innovation in any media, it would be impossible to top him. His humor was unique, and he used television to constantly challenge the audience, its expectations and its comfort. While difficult to explain specifically why anything is funny, Kovacs seems to be particularly challenging. Reality in his hands is truly only a matter of opinion because everything in the universe seems to come together as one big leg sticking out to trip us up. Gravity is only a hunch, and what is seen had better be questioned rather than casually believed.  Reaction to the upset expectations and reality turned upside down can be hysterically funny.  It also can be profoundly disturbing.
  Shout! Factory has done a masterful job at archiving Kovacs' career, from the early morning shows in the late '40s and early '50s through the Emmy-winning ABC TV shows later in his career.  His work lies somewhere between sitcoms and burlesque, between Laugh-In and grotesque character humor, between classic comedy and some weird, futuristic rant.  His half-hour silent comedy, Eugene, (the color version reproduced here) is Chaplin with the pathos turned down and the absurd turned up. The legendary Nairobe Trio, with three overcoated apes miming Robert Maxwell's Sofleggio and one of the apes occasionally bopped on the head while conducting with a half-eaten banana, must be seen to be believed. The trick comes is getting the image of the apes out of your head. And that's where the word ""genius"" comes back into play: You never will.
  We are beholding to Shout! Factory for releasing as close to a complete Ernie Kovacs as we are likely to see.  Don't plan to sit down and watch all the material at once. Like a fine bourbon, EK is wonderful to taste now and again and reassuring to know that he sits on your shelf to be sampled at will.",1307750400,4,2480,4.885441527446301

4386001,5,B004IB04NU,"Many Ernie Kovacs fans already have the ""Best of Ernie Kovacs"" set, which first aired on public television in 1977. If you're wondering whether you should bother with this new collection, my answer is ""by all means!""

This six-disc set (a seventh is sold separately by the manufacturer, at a premium) traces the entire TV career of Ernie Kovacs, from his local morning show to his NBC morning and summer-replacement shows, then to his specials. There are some surprises here: for example, ""Eugene"" (the famous ""silent show,"" familiar from the ""Best of"" set) is seen here in its original COLOR version for NBC (most of the same gags but performed for a studio audience, and with slightly different staging that he perfected later). We also see some long-lost artifacts from his media projects, including several of his mini-sketch Dutch Masters cigar commercials, a representative episode of his game show ""Take a Good Look"" (with blackout gags later used in his ABC specials, and no doubt baffling the celebrity contestants!), a sample of his hosting chores on the ""Silents Please"" movie broadcasts, and even the coming-attractions trailer for his 1957 movie OPERATION MAD BALL. (It's the funniest trailer in screen history, as Ernie totally ignores the film's content and shows irrelevant film clips! Exhibitors in 1957 just didn't get it, advising other theater managers to show the film but not the trailer!)

With so much material on display here, the collection contains generous samplings of the best and less-than-best of Ernie Kovacs. Some of Ernie's work is brilliant. The man was years ahead of his time, dreaming up visual gags and blackouts that are both very funny and technically clever. However, as ""Laugh-In"" producer George Schlatter says, ""Ernie had no interest in punchlines."" That's why more than a few sketches build up but don't pay off -- they just stop, as though Ernie was saying, ""Well, you get the idea so I won't bother finishing it."" Maddening for the viewer, but this may just be Ernie as an impatient creator, looking ahead to the next routine while shrugging off the current one.

Anyway, the broad spectrum of Ernie's work is what counts here. The DVD producers have done a great job capturing the essence of Ernie Kovacs, and presenting him in the shows' original contexts, with many shows in complete form. We see him mastering all sorts of situations: performing before studio audiences; presiding over chaotic live broadcasts; doing vaudevillian sketches with second-bananas Henry Lascoe, Al Kelly, and announcer Bill Wendell; and indulging in improvisation and costume comedy. Much as Johnny Carson did later with his Art Fern, Carnac, and Floyd R. Turbo characters, Ernie brings us the hilariously effete poet Percy Dovetonsils, the frustrated magician Matzoh Hepplewhite, the surly chef Miklos Molnar, the pompous opera singer, the extemporaneous talking turtle and talking fish, and most unforgettably, ""The Fabulous Nairobi Trio"" (Ernie and company in gorilla suits, miming to Robert Maxwell's ""Solfeggia"").

Edie Adams was Ernie's singing star as far back as 1951, and she demonstrates superb vocal talent and really impressive comic timing (as in her lampoon of Marilyn Monroe). Edie is seen throughout the collection, although some of the music from the original NBC shows has been deleted for legal reasons. The NBC morning shows featured singer Matt Dennis; he is entirely missing from this collection but the missing footage is intact in the ""Best of Ernie Kovacs"" set -- and somewhere Ernie is probably amused that we have to consult two different sets just to play one complete bit!

The centerpiece of this collection is all five of Ernie's specials, taped for ABC. They were his own video laboratory, staged, engineered, and edited under controlled conditions by Ernie and his loyal production staff. No studio audience, no laugh tracks, no live band, just Ernie indulging his every whim: playing tricks with the camera, rigging elaborate props for gags that last only a few seconds, and creating mood pieces set to his favorite recordings. Ernie Kovacs is remembered for these specials, and if you know any Kovacs at all, you'll probably recognize the lovely Jolene Brand and the diminutive, ever-smiling Bobby Lauher as Ernie's supporting actors. (Make that ""supporting players"" -- tall Joe Mikolas is not an actor.)

""The Ernie Kovacs Collection"" is highly recommended for vintage-TV enthusiasts and those who have fond memories of Ernie Kovacs. Hours and hours of fun. But don't throw away the old ""Best of Ernie Kovacs"" set, which offers extra helpings not included here.",1307577600,9,4628,5.155792276964048

This collection suffers, in my view, from two shortcomings:  Some repetion of skits from one program to another; and not enough sightings of Edie Adams who was both beautiful and talented.

It's definitely worth it to get the bonus disc. I really enjoyed it. You get two clips from ""Tonight!"", from October 22 and December 11 1956, one which has a ""Eugene"" sketch and another which features Ernie, along with Allen Funt as a guest, doing a ""Candid Camera"" satire. ""Eugene"" was first introduced on ""Tonight!"", I believe, so this may have been the first time he was seen. Then there's ""Tonight! America After Dark"" from July 26, 1957 which is an interview with Ernie and Edie in their penthouse on Central Park West. In addition you get about an hour's worth of extra bits culled from various installments of ""The Ernie Kovacs Show"", which aired from 8-9pm on NBC, Mondays, July 2-Sept 10, 1956. The bonus disc contains an extra TWO HOURS worth of material.

4386013,5,B004IB04NU,"One of the best things about Ernie Kovacs was his consummate ease in front of the camera. There has probably never been another performer before or since who is so relaxed, so personable. There is none of the ""i'm so much hipper than you vibe"" that spoils a lot of comedy today- Kovacs was having a wonderful time, and he wanted you to have a wonderful time too. Even so, his sense of humor was quite dark for the 1950s. Hardly a skit goes by without some reference to death or pain, from Miklos Molnar killing Howdy Doody by cutting his strings with a pair of scissors to Kovacs himself bleeding to death while a vapid game show panel tries to guess ""whom dunnit"". There is a definite edge to much of his work that is the most startling thing here, more so than the technological experimentation or even the bizarre images that he could dream up. Though Ernie reportedly did not like working in front of an audience, I think he was energized by the crowd. I tend to prefer the 1956 NBC shows because they have that feeling of anything can happen that's missing from the more formalized ABC specials. But it's all wonderful stuff.

This is a beautifully produced box set, worthy of Ernie, which is saying a lot.  I'm sure this was a labor of love by all concerned, especially by the late Edie Adams who made sure Kovacs' work did not end up at the  bottom of the Atlantic like most other NBC programs of the period. We should have a discussion about the wisdom of allowing for-profit corporations to be the guardians of our cultural heritage, but I suppose this isn't the place.

Anyway, buy this. It's one of the best DVD boxes ever.",1303603200,13,1634,4.4366666666666665

4386016,5,B004IB04NU,"Long before Monty Python, Saturday Night Live, and David Letterman's late night TV shows, there was Ernie Kovacs. It's almost certain that the creators of these sketch comedy and host-behind-the desk shows watched Kovacs during his all too brief career. (He died in a car crash in 1962, at age 42, barely 12 years since first appeared on local TV in Philadelphia). As irony would have it, Comedy Central host Jon Stewart was born in Trenton, New Jersey - Kovacs birthplace as well - the same year that Kovacs died. And Stewart (real name: Jonathan Stuart Liebowitz) would not be the success he is if Kovacs hadn't paved the way. (I, too, was born in Trenton and remember as a young kid, when Kovacs made the move from radio in Trenton to television in Philly.)

For the last four decades Kovacs was an ""underground"" celebrity. He was often overlooked in the history of TV and comedy. With this DVD release - and all the press it should garner - the rest of the world, and a whole new generation of fans should become Ernie-holics. MAJOR credit for this release needs to go to two people and a company. First is Edie Adams, Kovacs wife and co-star of his show. After Ernie's death, when the major TV networks (Kovacs shows were on NBC, ABC and Dumont) were erasing the video tapes of show to re-use them, Adams bought  - at great personal expense - as many as she could - thus saving them from oblivion. She created an archive, now managed by her son - from her second marriage - Josh Mills. Mills is the ""keeper of the Kovacs flame"" and the Producer of this set. The third party we need to thank is Shout Factory, the LA video reissue company, who is making this available for home viewing in such a deluxe package. And, they paid even more of a tribute by offering a SEVENTH ""bonus DVD"" with over two-hours of material including Kovacs two ""Tonight"" shows - not to be confused with the Johnny Carson version.

I won't go into too much detail about Kovacs because you probably found this review after reading about the set and want to know how good it is. Well. It's better than good: It's Great! (Oh did I forget to mention the gorgeous booklet - compiled by Mills - that comes with it? ) The first shows (1950), sadly,  no longer exist. The set starts with Kovacs LAST show in Philly (1951). And the prints on the first disc are not as sharp as you are probably used to. But at least we can see them and the later ones (including Kovacs's game shows) look superb.

I'll also suggest that folks new to Kovacs, pop in Disc One, go to the Bonus Features, and watch the 1987 ATAS Hall of Fame Induction. This will give you a brief overview of Kovacs life. Then go back to the first show on this disc - It's Time For Ernie 3/7/1951.

There were some Kovacs VHS tapes released years ago and a few of those clips are here too (though in better quality, if that exists). But MOST of the contents on the set have not been seen in over 50 years!  I'm told that there are still more shows ""in the vault"" so hopefully large sales will encourage Mills and Shout Factory to follow up with a sequel.

If you remember Kovacs you need to see this collection. If you are too young to remember him, you need to see this as well. This is where those TV comedy icons YOU know got their ideas!

Ernie pioneered the music video (admittedly, he did it with classical music), his blackout sketches were often tremendous, and his cast of characters -- Wolfgang von Saurbraten, Auntie Grusome, Uncle Buddy, Miklos Molnar, and of course Percy Dovetonsils -- are good enough to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the creations of comedians such as Red Skelton and Jackie Gleason.

The result was a far more sophisticated presentation, light years ahead of its time, especially with his last work (The ABC Specials of the early 1960s) where he worked on newly developed videotape, opening a new world of technical possibilities.  Even when he was forced to work in front of an audience (which he hated) or hosted the bizarre game show ""Take A Good Look"", he made fun of the whole production, not unlike Letterman would do years later (Letterman was a big fan and was obviously influenced by Kovacs' style).
