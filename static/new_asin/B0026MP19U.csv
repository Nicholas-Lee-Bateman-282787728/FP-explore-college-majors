They are 20 and 18, and since the title character is a around the same age, thought they'd relate.  They did...as did my wife...and I.  We ALL loved this gem of a film.  NO CAR CRASHES!  NO ALIENS!  NO END OF THE WORLD!  Just honest, interesting characters, a well-crafted story, that was wonderfully acted, and professionally filmed.  Truly a great find that all in my family, from 18 to 60 enjoyed tremendously.  Oh...there is A SUPER HERO!  Buy, watch, enjoy and share this moment.",1248739200,4,569,4.6
3854390,5,B0026MP19U,"I was lucky to have caught a screening of the movie here in L.A. (one of the few perks of living in LaLa land).  Just a great movie and outstanding performances from everyone and most notably (for me) from new comer, Ian Nelson.

The premise of the movie makes you think you are going to really have to suspend your disbelief but it does a wonderful job of flowing almost flawlessly throughout and is just a lucid wonderful story with a great theme.

I don't want to spoil anything so I will leave it at that but I am quite happy that this movie is finally out on DVD as I've been anxiously awaiting to see it again since seeing at the cinema.

Another great indy that is better than almost all the top ten movies currently in the summer blockbusters.  This one is up there with the likes of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, in movie that never got full theatrical but is just amazingly good.",1247529600,4,880,4.27710843373494
3854391,5,B0026MP19U,"There are few times as a movie watcher when you get to be there at the beginning. By the time a directors name gets tossed into the open arena of critics and fans alike, they have already created a handful of theatrical visions and you find yourself scouring Netflix or Blockbuster trying to walk backwards through their cinematic resume. Well, this is one of those few times where you can say you were there when. In a small number of years you can act snobby at parties and brag about how you saw this feature length debut years before anyone knew about the following successes. What's better than having intellectual ammo at the ready to feel superior about? Not much.

Let's talk about the movie first, before we get into the behind the scenes masterminds. Dakota Skye is a superhero tale with a twist. Dakota is a young girl, only medium cute (a line from the movie, which is terribly inaccurate) and she has a secret power. No one can lie to her. Anytime someone distorts the truth around her, their real meaning and honest thoughts appear in front of her like subtitles in a foreign film. You might think this would be a great power to have, but once you start realizing how much people lie and what they really feel about you, life can seem pretty bleak. This is where Jonah comes in, a pleasant tinged stoner who seemingly never tells a lie. Meeting Jonah throws Dakota's world into a spin because there are only two answers, either her powers don't work on him or he really is the last honest person on Earth. Let the teenage confusion and angst begin!

The movie is really centered around the relationship between Dakota and Jonah, which places a large amount of the success on the shoulders of Eileen Boylan (as Dakota) and Ian Nelson (as Jonah). Thankfully both step up to the task. The chemistry on screen helps the audience sink into their world, reminding us about that time when we met the first person who got underneath all our walls and social defenses. Eileen shuffles her scuffed jeans and worn-in Chucks through a performance balanced between one part slacker, one part dreamer and one part trail blazer. Top off with a dash of jaded teenager forced to grow up too fast and you have the incarnation of Dakota. Her adorable presence on screen and earnest moments really center the film and keep the audience tuned in. Coming in to lend his assistance is Ian with a humble smile, honest face and almost effortless delivery. Certain scenes for him felt so natural it could have been mistaken for improv, just letting him go and feel the moment as it happened. You can expect to see both of these young actors in the coming years, that is, if you haven't already caught Eileen in Greek and Making Change and Ian in Bratz and True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet.

Now both of those performances would not have been possible if not for the delicate touch of director John Humber. This is his first feature film and I can guarantee it won't be his last to reach the silver screen. Dakota Skye has the feel and rough edges of a debut filmmaker, but there is a vision, a concept and a level of skill that cannot be denied. The whole story is visually told with delicate pacing, filled with engaging moments, leading up to a beautifully touching final scene right out of any major motion picture we see today (specifically in the romance genre, that is). If this is the beginning of a career, all I can say is I am excited to see what's coming down the line.",1247529600,21,3475,4.539074960127592
3854392,4,B0026MP19U,"I was actually surprised by this hidden gem, as it is not often that a teen film can successfully pull off having a ""superpower"" theme yet still ring as believable. The director and writer are unknowns, and I had not seen the main lead of Eileen Boylan in anything, so I was going in with a fresh slate.

This is a high school film in every way, full of angst, potheads, brainiacs, musicians and one girl with the power to tell when someone is lying - complete with a textual supplement for us to know what the real translations are when someone orates an untruth. Over the course of a year we get to see her find love, have a few of those incredible moments shared with someone special, all while discovering what is most important-in-the-moment kind of theme as high school ends.

The performances were actually spot-on for what was required, and without dissecting the slight faults and several scenes that took too long, everything was put together rather competently. A few laugh out loud moments punctuate a believable sense in what she can see in these false truths from friends; In the end it all makes for a surprising reality check in thinking this could happen. The writing is decent and the Arizona countryside gets showcased nicely.

The special features include a 30 minute standard making-of filled with interviews, behind the scenes but most of all the reasons why the thank-you list in the credits included so many A-list actors and directors. The five minutes of bloopers were mismanaged (did not need to see Eileen get legitimately sick during a take, or other unfunny moments) but it did have one or two funny scenes. The couple two-minute interviews of Ian and Eileen were cut from the documentary and should have been included with it, and the standard indie commentary rounds out the supplements.

A recommendable film for being a first out attempt on most everyone's part, and I hope it gets a fair shake in distribution.",1247443200,3,1945,4.745562130177515

3854394,5,B0026MP19U,"I saw Dakota Skye last year at the Phoenix Film Festival and have been anxiously awaiting its release on DVD ever since. This is one of those rare movies that you really want to share with your close friends, but you find it impossible to sum up. ""A girl who can see through any lie falls in love with boyfriend's best friend..."" sounds simple, right? Doesn't come close to doing this movie justice. This film works its way inside and takes you on an emotional journey right along with the characters. Dakota's first line hooked me and something about that character pulled me all the way through to the end. Viewers will want to compare this to Juno, but as much as I enjoyed that film, Dakota Skye has a unique spark beyond comparison.  Excellent direction and fantastic acting all around. This movie comes with my highest recommendation!",1240099200,11,840,4.675675675675675

3854434,4,B0026MP19U,"This a movie about finding your true love.

The title character is an junior/senior in high school that like most teenagers is confused about what is supposed to come next.

Her best friend is the kind that has her whole life planned and is concerned at Dakota's apathy, and her boyfriend spends his off time smoking the bong.

The twist in this movie that sets it apart from others is that Dakota has a superpower. She can always tell when someone is lying to her. When Jonah, her boyfriend's good friend from back in the day comes into town, she is intrigued that he never lies. Jonah eventually confesses his love for her, and they begin an affair. Dakota then has to decide who to stay with, her loyal boyfriend who is a good guy, or his intriguing friend who she has strong feeling for unlike any she has ever had.

I also thoroughly enjoyed the music and look forward to hearing more from this composer.  The movie is well worth the price.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dakota-Skye/dp/B0026MP19U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dakota Skye</a>",1250380800,6,414,6.648148148148148
3854454,2,B0026MP19U,"Teen angst in American ""independent"" film-making is generally the sign of provincial, short-sighted, and inconsequential concoctions.  Again and again teens rebel in little towns where you need a car to go anywhere and in the end they celebrate conformity masquerading it as ""growing up"".  I suppose that the kudos given to this film from other reviewers comes from the fact that they watch many bad movies during the year, independent or not, so in comparison ""Dakota..."" does not seem like an offender.  I agree that the director will be called by Hollywood, but that does not mean anything good really.
For the rest of us here in the wide open world it is a problem that  American movies are so bad nowadays, because the ""other"" cinema is a bit more difficult to find and when it is available it is difficult to get good references to what to look for.
""Dakota.."" is one more of those movies that you know, about teens trying to make sense of their lives in a disjointed society, but it is even less.  In fact, it is any teen series in TV but with one good idea (a superpower).  It is about a cute (really cute) girl and two cute boys.  Not for mature viewers (or at least, those that remember how a real teen rom com used to look like.  Please John Hughes, do something!).

Update (five days later): Today August 6th, 2009, John Hughes died. Thank you for Ferris, for Molly in pink dresses, for the Club, and for Steve Martin opening that door to a lonely John Candy.  We will miss you.",1249084800,6,1490,4.485185185185185

8353134,3,B0026MP19U,"Dakota Skye (Eileen Boylan) is a high school senior facing life and love the hard way. She's been dating a local rock singer since childhood, but starts falling for his best friend Jonah from New York. She has a superpower: Dakota can tell when someone is lying, and discerns the truth from the lie. Unfortunately, she's mixed up emotionally because either Jonah doesn't ever lie or he does lie but she can't sense it! Whom does she choose? Does she actually choose anyone or decide to remain unattached? Three stars for this mildly entertaining coming-of-age story.",1524528000,,566,4.90625
8353135,5,B0026MP19U,"While I like coming-of-age movies, it is easy for them to lose pace and drag.  Not a problem here.  An intelligent movie that does a good job of looking at teenage angst without needing villains or antiheros.",1524096000,,208,4.594594594594595

8353137,4,B0026MP19U,"Four stars to balance all those one- and two-star reviews. This is a fun, enjoyable coming-of-age flick. The ""superhero"" twist gave it a little more interest than the standard film. Don't we all wish we had that ability? I saw this on Netflix several years ago. There are very few movies I watch twice. That automatically warrants four stars (five is for classics only). Don't listen to the nay-sayers unless so-called ""bad"" language offends you. It's always irritating to me when people give a movie a bad rating for language. Grow up already! That is the way some people talk. If you don't like it, stop the movie and watch something else but don't give the whole movie a bad rating for a few words that you personally find offensive. Okay, stepping off soapbox now.",1523491200,5,768,4.696296296296296
8353138,2,B0026MP19U,"Pretty awful for a coming of age, self-discovery movie.  Boylan was irritating and uninteresting.  Didn't really care if she found happiness or not.  Appropriate ending if Joshua simply had moved on to a less emotionally conflicted relationship.  I would have given it a ""one star"" rating but I really don't hate movies.",1523404800,,320,5.096153846153846
8353139,1,B0026MP19U,This movie is terrible.  First the girl is dull and lifeless.  Second she judges other people with her so called lie detector of a mind.  Yet she screws another guy/cheats on her boyfriend.  Third she's a jerk to her friends.  I couldn't wait until it ended.  Lower than one star actually.,1523145600,,289,4.568627450980392
