4156525,3,B003N71L1E,Russell's performance alone is worth a look at. As for the film as a whole it could've been executed better.,1474588800,,108,4.45
4156526,5,B003N71L1E,"I remember watching this as a kid as it first aired on ABC. It was great then and it is still great now....Kurt Russell definitely brings the king back to life. The music was great, the acting was solid. John Carpenter did a great job, if you don't own this, and you are an Elvis fan, get it!!!",1473897600,,294,4.086206896551724
4156527,4,B003N71L1E,"Kurt Russell manages to disappear into a persona of Elvis.  It follows the usual flashbacks of any music bio.  But most of the boring stuff is skipped over (such as the weaker movies of the late 1960's.)  You get a sense of how quickly the fame and money overwhelmed his old personality and the gilded cage he lived in for the next 20 plus years.  The only thing that overcame his boredom of touring was his boredom of staying home.  The extent of his pill addictions is sort of whitewashed, but in 1979 it might have been difficult to get the film made with overt drug behavior and even more difficult to get it distributed.  Overall, it's very competent.",1472515200,,656,4.470588235294118
4156528,5,B003N71L1E,This is the best of all the releases.  This IAS an amazing version as it contains all the footage from the television version and most of the overseas theatrical version. They cut the end short by one song but most likely since Burning Love was not released until 1972. The film ends at the beginning of his 1969 Las Vegas come back. A great movie that last the test of time.,1472256000,2,375,4.28169014084507
4156529,4,B003N71L1E,"Great quality, great performances by all, specially Shelly Winters. i watched this on TV 1979",1471651200,,93,5.266666666666667
4156530,4,B003N71L1E,"Kurt Russell, John Carpenter and Elvis were made for each other. If you doubt me, watch Carpenter's biopic ""Elvis"" made two years after the King passed away with a marvelous performance by Russell. Russell made a perfect collaborator with Carpenter working with him on three of his best features (""The Thing"", ""Escape from New York"" and ""Big Trouble in Little China"" where Russell channeled  his inner John Wayne for his parody performance--a fourth collaboration ""Escape from L.A."" plays almost like both parody and remake of the original film). This is the second release from Shout Select a new imprint for cult classics.

""Elvis"" follows the King from his life in poverty as a child featuring Bing Russell (Kurt's dad) as his father Vernon, Shelley Winters as Gladys Presley and Season Hubley as Priscilla to the point when he conquers Vegas. The cast is rounded out by the perpetually young Joe Mantegna as well as Ed Begley, Jr.  The series was nominated for quite a few Emmy Awards (and should have won for Russell a perpetually underrated actor).

This appears to be identical to the UK Blu-ray release from 2010. The transfer appears to be the same--the source is a bit dated but the detail is pretty good.  ""Elvis"" has one flaw that will both many fans--it's not in the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The film is presented in 1.78:1 but, it appears to me, this results with extra space at the edge of the frame that wasn't visible before and some cropping at the bottom and top of the image. Those looking for the original aspect ratio will be disappointed. However, this film was released as a feature overseas and I have heard that it was presented in this aspect ratio.

This is the 170 minute version (which was released overseas on video) (according to IMDB the original TV ""event"" ran 150 minutes) the theatrical cut overseas ran about 105 minutes.

The original mono soundtrack is presented here and sounds quite nice with dialog clear.

The special features are nice but I would have killed for a Russell/Carpenter commentary track here. It's not mentioned on the box but we do get a commentary from Elvis impersonator Ronnie McDowell who did all the singing in the film for Russell nicely moderated by Author Edie Hand with good trivia.

We also get a short featurette produced at the time to promote the film (it's under 12 minutes) with some behind the scenes footage. The other special features are the same as the UK release including clips from American Bandstand and a photo gallery (also not mentioned on the box).

This is a nice looking (although it could have been a perfect looking) presentation of the film with a different aspect ratio from the original broadcast and some nice special features.

I would have liked to see a new restoration and transfer and a commentary from Carpenter & Russell but what we do get is pretty good.",1471478400,5,2861,4.771255060728745

4156532,5,B003N71L1E,By far the best Elvis documentary based on the King of Rock and Roll! Kurt Russell plays the role of a lifetime and by no means did he get the praise he deserved in Hollywood for this role. And finally in Blu-Ray so don't miss this epic film ,1452124800,,242,4.041666666666667

4156536,5,B003N71L1E,"This played fine on our old Blu-ray player. I saw this when it was first on TV and had been looking for it on DVD or Blu.

Kurt Russell is absolutely *extraordinary* as Elvis.

Naturally, most of the bad stuff (drug use, infidelity, mass quantities of peanut butter) was not included. Still, great performances and very entertaining.",1438128000,,333,4.824561403508772
4156537,5,B003N71L1E,Where did they film the inside mansion scenes? The inside mansion scenes shows a spiral staircase inside Graceland leading upstairs. I have been to the Graceland mansion many times and the main staircase is straight and not spiral.,1435276800,,231,5.105263157894737

4156542,4,B003N71L1E,"Great blu ray of this TV film from John Carpenter.  The only drawback (to some) is that the original film was shot for television, so it had a 1:33:1 framing (square) and this new blu ray edition, although much sharper and worth the picture and sound value, is now 16X9 (rectangle) which means either the original square images was cropped on top and bottom to make the frame 16X9 or, the film may have been shot in widescreen originally (I believe it ran in theaters overseas in a shorter version) and then cropped for US Television.  Either way, it looks great, there is a commentary and an old (weathered) making of short, etc.  Too bad we didn't get a Carpenter commentary. Still for the money, a good disc. I kept my previous DVD and will keep this as well due to the aspect ratio situation.",1427932800,2,796,4.475862068965517

4156544,5,B003N71L1E,"I remember seeing reruns of this as a kid and my parents were Elvis fans so I got it honest. Funny thing is I have always been a Kurt Russell fan from childhood (mostly due to Big Trouble in Little China). Anyway, I saw this on AmazonUK and it is not available in the US. I snatched it up as I have a region free Blu ray player and was looking forward to adding it to my massive Blu ray collection. It is region free and best of all, which really surprised me, WIDESCREEN!!! I did not expect that as this was a made-for-tv movie from '79 which everything on tv was 4:3 aspect ratio. The Blu ray looks fantastic and sounds superb. Kurt Russell knocks it out of the park with his performance. Awesome in every way.",1423785600,,712,4.166666666666667

4156548,4,B003N71L1E,"I guess this has been the best movie made on Elvis, good reflection of the 50's. Kurt looks and acts just like him, too bad Prisilla's part is so washed out and misscasted. Very good transfer to Bluray. My only question is and will be, why with so many Spanish speaking fans all over the world, movies still come with no subtitles in Spanish?",1407888000,3,342,4.359375
4156549,5,B003N71L1E,I first watched this when it first aired in 1979. A excellent job was done by then young director John Carpenter of Halloween fame. Kurt Russel was superb as Elvis & so was Shelly Winters as his mother. I isn't very factual about all the drug taking etc of Elvis no. But it's a great tribute to Elvis & all his true blue swede fans! The special features are not restored but still nice to see them here at least!,1404432000,3,412,4.1625
4156550,4,B003N71L1E,"Saw this back in the '70's as a mini-series . . .
not sure if it's complete as it was later edited for re-telecast.
If you like Elvis this is the biography to watch . . .",1393200000,,170,3.6216216216216215
4156551,3,B003N71L1E,"John Carpenter's uniquely-cast ELVIS has Kurt Russell portraying the singer and his dad, Bing as Vernon Presley, Elvis's father.

Risking the wrath of fans here...  this picture doesn't really qualfy as a biopic-- maybe SEMI-biopic is most accurate. ""Elvis"" is a determined whitewash of the Presley legend that's certainly understandable, as it was created within a year of the King's untimely demise.

Consider what ISN'T included in the story:
Revealing details about Tom Parker, an illegal alien and Presley's overpaid agent (50% of the take!).

Not a single reference to the factors that contributed to Elvis's death: 1.) bizarre eating habits; 2.) years of drug abuse, especially Demerol. Nor do we see the late 70s decline in health and ballooning weight, as the story ends with Elvis's triumphant 1969 return to Las Vegas.

Also not seen are any number of Hollywood affairs conducted with Ann-Margret and others. Priscilla's dalliance with karate instructor Mike Stone, a contributing factor in the Presleys' divorce is also ignored.

His strange relationship with hairdresser Larry Geller, a man Elvis confided in and was influenced by philosophically, isn't even hinted at. An odd decision, as books on religion and mysticism obtained from Geller became part of Elvis's library of 200 that went everywhere he did.

The Memphis crony hangers-on who shielded Presley, told him what he wanted to hear and enabled his excesses, are handled lightly.

As revisionist propaganda, ""Elvis"" is unparalled. Perhaps someday the half-story steadfastly promoted here will become accepted truth. Or perhaps not, for despite all its attempts at sanitizing, the reality that Elvis Presley was an enormously talented and successful, yet lonely and troubled man ultimately still comes through to viewers.

4156553,5,B003N71L1E,"I've owned this Blu Ray ...heck it was one of the earliest imports I ever purchased.... for years. It is not only a great movie about a great entertainer , but it looks GREAT on BR!  Kurt Russell channels Elvis, Shelly Winters is great as his dear mother... heck the whole cast is wonderful, the period is excellent (it was filmed only two years after the Kings death) so being '79 they didn't need to do the drastic work a film company would now to get the right look. There is a bonus featurette from the time of the shoot and a wonderful commentary by Ronnie McDowell (who sang for Elvis).... its just a damn fine effort by all in front and behind the camera and I can't rate it high enough.... BUY IT NOW , before it goes out of print.",1379116800,9,739,4.204225352112676

Also while Ronnie Mcdowell does a good impersonation the film is limited by the list of songs he sings, no Hound Dog, Jailhouse Rock, Don't be Cruel, etc...but overall worth a look for Russell's performance. I just wish these films stuck closer to the facts. Most egregious error shows Presley performing at a club while in the army when Elvis himself is on record saying he NEVER performed while in the military.",1498003200,,507,4.707865168539326
