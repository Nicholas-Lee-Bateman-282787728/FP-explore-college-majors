8055281,4,B00081FJFC,"This was a very interesting and helpful book if one is interested in learning the German side of why WWII happened. If I was teaching a course on WWII, it would be a must read book. However, the edition I purchased did not have the necessary references and footnotes that would be expected in such a book, so I could only give it a 4 star rating. Like any good student of history the reader should question conclusions that do not correspond to previous known facts and use the questioning techique in one's reading of any text including this one.",1353974400,,547,4.48
