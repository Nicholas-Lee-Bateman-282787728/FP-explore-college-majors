Anyone, even a non-musician Jazz fan can get something out of this DVD, but it's particularly good for beginners as an introduction to playing the Jazz ride cymbal. I highly recommend this DVD if you are looking to get started with Jazz drumming.",1524787200,,363,4.6875

8383076,5,B002WI2IDU,"This DVD is constructed brilliantly and can be comprehended by any serious person who wants to learn how to perform on the drums the correct way. Peters approach to every section of this DVD is just wonderful. He is a master teacher, and musician.
I would highly recommend this DVD to any drummer whether you are a beginner, intermediate, or even an advanced player. I guarantee that you will definitely get a lot out of this DVD. Also,go and hear Peter play live too.  If you have the opportunity to meet Peter and talk to him after one of his gigs he is a very cool real down to earth human being.

8383077,5,B002WI2IDU,"Great instructional video.  If Peter Erskine publishes it, I buy it! He is one of most renowned percussion instructors of our time
and what he dosen't know about drums and percussion would fit in a thimble.  This DVD is very interesting, easy to follow and
a wealth of  informaton on timekeeping. I have met this man and he is just as friendly as he looks.  Alway ready to help a drummer
out when asked to do so.  And after you study with this DVD, tou too will agree with my take on Pete Erskine.

I love this guy, just looking at him is inspiring and of course, you'll learn from this video",1373155200,,156,4.064516129032258
8383079,5,B002WI2IDU,"I have always loved Peter Erskine. Check out his CDs - all of them. This DVD has some very tasteful songs to
demonstrate the ""feel"" of what Peter is teaching. He breaks down the jazz beats and plays everything beautifully and simply.
Less is more, for Erskine. And he demonstrates this on everything he plays and feels. He is a special teacher and a great companion on your way to learning about timekeeping, for it is everything!

Buy this DVD. You will learn and grow.",1353024000,,470,4.529411764705882
