812433,5,630423385X,"I am happy to say this film is true to the nature of human beings.  I really appreciate the way the characters slowly came to together and told a crisp, honest story.  Ruby Jean is a young woman on the verge of making a  life altering decision.  She meets Joe, a retiring rodeo rider, with a  heart-of-gold.  Ruby Jean and Joe fall in a sweet-friendship type of love  and give each other the courage to face both of their fears.  Moving story.",925689600,12,443,4.317073170731708
812575,5,630423385X,This movie is one of Tom Selleck's best peformances of coming to grips with where you are at in life and it's reflections of the past and the future and having flaws as a human being and friendships along the way. Very well put together and touching. Please put this in dvd form. And where has this movie been! I've only seen it once when it first aired.........haven't seen it since. Tom Selleck is a great actor and gives a great perfomance of the character he plays. Thumbs up.,1316649600,2,480,4.404494382022472
812576,5,630423385X,I have watched it several times over and would do so again. Ruby Jean's dialogues are awesome. The subject is treated very delicately. There is no lewdness. It is all about simple people and deep feelings.,1302220800,4,205,4.722222222222222
812577,3,630423385X,A rodeo movie about an aging cowboy and a girl trying to find a direction in life .It has a very good cast that develops the material in a professional manner .,1299110400,,160,4.03125
812578,4,630423385X,I really enjoyed this movie.  Selleck is at his best as an aging rodeo rider.  He is provided a reason to discard part of his resentment of life and redeem himself.  Good movie; would recommend.,1297728000,3,194,4.485714285714286
812579,5,630423385X,"I saw this movie a few years ago and loved it.  It was so sincere and will capture your heart. Why has this not been seen more and available on DVD?  Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!!!!",1279065600,8,182,3.891891891891892

812583,5,630423385X,"One of Selleck's great roles and that young girl played a touching and wonderful role as well. She touched my heart, as well as the Joe's girlfriend (another outstanding actress). Excellent through and through and even had an old cowboy (whose name escapes me) who tells Tom the truth about his rodeoing and life. Outstanding. Not many movies touch this ""oldie but goodie"" (me) but this one sure did. It struck a cord and I won't forgot it. It was one of those movies I had to IMMEDIATELY search for in hopes of buying it (at this price, no way). Five + stars and thanks to Lifetime TV for putting it on.",982195200,13,604,4.401785714285714
812584,5,630423385X,"And 'offbeat'??  Where did he get that?  This film is a classic.  Tom Selleck portrays Joe Wade as a real person.  He's heroic at times, but he's not immune to the human condition of self-doubt and regrets from the past.  Rebekah Johnson as Ruby Jean Babcock perfectly balances vunerability with modern-day savvy about the world around her.  Without unnecessary lewdness, the movie depicts a beautiful love story.  Despite what others see when they look at them, Ruby Jean and Joe connect.  The movie was heartwarming to watch and I am looking forward to it being released on DVD as I will certainly buy it!",973468800,26,607,4.769230769230769
