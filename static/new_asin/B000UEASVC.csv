8213061,1,B000UEASVC,"i was very disppointed with this interactive dvd. previously i bought two eurotalk dvds in the russian series - the beginners eurotalk and the worldtalk, and was very satisfied with both. by contrast, the beginners+ did not allow the viewer/listener to build on the previous lessons as in the previous dvds. furthermore, when pictures and words were used together, the pictures had more than one subject content, so unless the viewer already knew the russian word, it was not possible to identify what word went with a particular image. as an aside, the male 'teacher' was extremely anoying in his mannerisms.",1237593600,10,609,5.03960396039604
