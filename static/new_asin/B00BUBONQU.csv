5674608,1,B00BUBONQU,Didn't like it at all. It was just not the kind of movie I enjoy. I like a clean movie.,1397433600,5,87,3.4
5674609,2,B00BUBONQU,Don't watch if you don't like sex scenes and profanity. It had the potential to be a good movie. Two stars for what I saw.,1397260800,17,122,3.92
5674610,1,B00BUBONQU,I was turn off the write up or primmest of the film. seemed tacky and cruel. As movies of this type are,1396915200,,103,3.727272727272727
5674611,1,B00BUBONQU,Really not worth the time it takes to wait through the credits...I flipped through to the end and that wasn't worth it either.,1396396800,,126,4.521739130434782
5674612,5,B00BUBONQU,"So I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one. I thought...eh, its been done before. But this Australian gem really keep me rolling. The family dynamics are hilarious and a little too close for comfort. Our lead is that character that you can't help rooting for. He tries so hard to do the right thing and just keeps digging his hole deeper and deeper. It's fun and light hearted.",1380844800,5,374,4.514705882352941
5674613,5,B00BUBONQU,"I'm a sucker for wedding films even as cheezy as they can be, but this one was different.  There was some raw, honesty and interesting plot twists. Would certainly recommend.",1379894400,4,174,4.8
5674614,2,B00BUBONQU,A quaint little movie with a quaint little story that is been done over and over. Is okay but wait until it hits TV,1379548800,,115,3.8333333333333335
5674615,4,B00BUBONQU,"This movie is a real ""sleeper"" - and I mean that in the sense that not too many people seem to know about it, not that it is a movie that will put you to sleep.
I rented it, not expecting too much, but was delightfully surprised. It is well-written, with solid and believable dialogue. All of the characters are absolutely lovable, which is unusual in a film. You just feel for everyone and all of the things they are going through. And everyone's acting is first-rate. No real screw-ups in that department.
The only downside is that it takes a bit of work during the beginning of the movie to figure out who everyone is, how they are related, and how their lives intersect. However, once you've gotten that figured out, the rest of the movie is just really enjoyable and engaging.
Hats off to everyone who was involved in it. Definitely worth a look!",1371686400,20,851,4.461538461538462

5674617,3,B00BUBONQU,Ok movie for a slow night,1419724800,,25,3.3333333333333335
5674618,4,B00BUBONQU,I enjoyed this movie very much. It was a sweet love story and showed that not all relationships can have happy endings. I'm not sure why people rated the movie so low if they didn't even finish more than 5 minutes of the movie. This is definitely not appropriate for children but the sexual parts were hardly graphic despite what the other reviews noted - but to each his own I supposed.,1419552000,,387,4.388888888888889

5674621,3,B00BUBONQU,Australian movie about a man needing money and an illegal alien wanting citizenship. Entertaining but typical love triangles.  Not for kids though...a little on the vulgar side.,1418083200,,177,5.555555555555555
5674622,1,B00BUBONQU,"Not very good.  It opened with needless, and I mean completely, sex scenes, and the plot was only so so",1417996800,,103,4.15
5674623,1,B00BUBONQU,Watched about 1 minute of it.  One of the first opening scenes was sexually explicit.  Turned it off.  I do not recommend this movie.,1417910400,,133,4.458333333333333

5674629,1,B00BUBONQU,I did not even get past the first 2 minutes.  This movie is not rated and should be at least rated R.  Very immoral which was so disappointing because I really wanted to watch a nice movie!,1413072000,3,189,4.081081081081081
5674630,1,B00BUBONQU,You do not want to watch this movie seriously unless your into porn...I started to watch this movie because I thought it was rated G or PG at the worse. The first minute of this movie is a complete turn off. A complete turn off. It should be considered pornography. I am disgusted!!!!! Please don't have your children around and really don't have yourself around!,1412899200,9,363,4.6

5674644,1,B00BUBONQU,"What a DUMB movie. Same critique as everyone else. Acting was ok. Story line was ridiculous. Ugly, middle-aged men in underwear, unfulfilled in their sexual lives, narrated by a 14 year old girl.  All around stupid.",1408406400,,215,4.972222222222222

5674647,4,B00BUBONQU,"Overall pretty good movie.  It does have profanity and explicit sex scenes (both of which happen in real life).  It tries to reflect real relationships and their real problems.  It was easy to picture many of the situations happening in day to day life.

I'm not sure why all the other reviews are so appalled by sex scenes.  It definitely wasn't a porn flick.  Sex happens . . .",1407542400,2,379,4.420289855072464
5674648,1,B00BUBONQU,Horrible movie with offensive content and language . Spent most of my time fast forwarding to see the end . Thought it was a romantic comedy but it was trash.,1406764800,3,158,4.3
5674649,3,B00BUBONQU,a pretty good movie when you need something to watch when you're bored. Cute plot... ends on a good note.,1406678400,,105,4.3
5674650,1,B00BUBONQU,Horrible first minute!  We turned it off right away due to the very in your face sex scene.  It was shockingly graphic.  Our assumption was NR was going to be like a Halllmark movie too.,1406419200,3,186,4.257142857142857
5674651,1,B00BUBONQU,Thought this was a wholesome hallmark movie. I could not have been more wrong. The opening credits are very graphic and the acting was only subpar.,1406160000,,147,4.6923076923076925

5674654,3,B00BUBONQU,"Amazon hasn't done a very good job of categorizing this movie (some people mention it being on a list of Hallmark movies, which no no no) so the commenters who've given 1- and 2-star reviews are mostly expressing their surprise about the sex.
What potential viewers should know is that yes, this is a mature movie that in discussing relationships includes the sexual situations. There is partial nudity, talk about sex/pornography, and some blatant scenes. But it is honest, modern, and treats sex as normal  and with respect.
Remember, this movie is not American (from Australia, so you get to see House of Lies' Josh Lawson and Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries' Essie Davis), so accompanying viewpoints and categorizations of how R- or X-rated this movie should be (as I saw one commenter wish to categorize it so) are different from what most of Amazon's American viewers will expect.
That taken care of, the movie is sweet and has a very ""indie"" feel to it - don't expect big Hollywood-esque plot lines.",1405123200,2,1005,4.87719298245614

5674657,1,B00BUBONQU,"What is it with all the gratuitous sex scenes in movies?  As the credits roll we are ""treated"" to different couples having sex.  What this has to do with the rest of the movie, I've no idea.  And will never know as I was disgusted by the first 5 minutes and turned it off.  Don't waste your time.",1404345600,,296,4.051724137931035

5674661,2,B00BUBONQU,"I was just in the mood for a romantic comedy. This was not it. I would hardly call it a comedy. I think I laughed maybe two times and not even hard.
The male character was just so annoying and seemed so irresponsible/immature.
There was no love story that gives you butterflies in your stomach. The ending was pretty bad, too and unclear. If you start watching it even after reading all the bad reviews and you don't find it interesting after 5 minutes or so, I would say turn it off. It doesn't get better at all. This is from someone who actually watched the whole thing.",1402704000,,573,4.314814814814815
5674662,1,B00BUBONQU,"I give this no stars. I watched less than 5mins. I was looking for something clean to watch. This says NR which I tool to mean 'not rated' which I used to believe was cleaner than a PG. In less than 5minutes, there is a bedroom scene and I shut it off quick before anything more than the man's behind could be shown. Disgusted.",1402617600,4,327,4.125
5674663,1,B00BUBONQU,"This movie came up when I searched for Hallmark movies.  It is definitely not a Hallmark production. I didn't even make it a minute into the movie before the X-rated content began.  Since it was not rated and came up under a Hallmark search, I assumed it would be OK. It is NOT! Thankfully, my children were not in the room when it began.  Amazon needs to examine this title's specifics to prevent such graphic surprises.",1402531200,7,421,4.5131578947368425

5674666,1,B00BUBONQU,This film was so disinteresting that I stopped watching it within the first 15 minutes.  I kept thinking it might get better but it was bad from the start so I did not finish watching it.  I would have given it no stars but that's not an option.,1401926400,3,245,4.083333333333333

5674668,1,B00BUBONQU,First minute should be rated x.  Very graphic sex scenes. So glad my girls weren't watching it with me. It was not rated so I figured it was like a hallmark movie. NOT! Turned it off promptly.,1400112000,61,192,4.1891891891891895
5674669,4,B00BUBONQU,"It is a three star, but a lot of people have been unduly harsh regarding this charming comedy.  Marrying for visa reasons has been the subject of quite a few cute films.  This one includes the family in a good way.  Not nearly as unrealistic as some others I've seen.  Fine for a rainy afternoon.",1400025600,5,296,4.327272727272727
5674670,3,B00BUBONQU,"A bunch of sex scenes with no nudity? Buzzkill!!!... But seriously,  the movie is charming despite its rather slow pace. The acting is pretty good, the characters are all likeable and the plot is very believable, but at times, I found myself bored. There are a great deal of filler moments and a few awkward ones, yet the British setting and overall atmosphere of the movie is light and refreshing. If this came on cable or regular TV, definitely give it a try, but I wouldn't pay money to see it.",1399420800,2,497,4.461538461538462

5674672,3,B00BUBONQU,This is one movie I would not recommend.  The groom is an immature man looking for a way to make a fast buck without working for it.  The so called bride is looking for a visa to the U.S.,1399161600,3,187,3.769230769230769

8573950,4,B00BUBONQU,"It was a fun movie with some insight into the shortcomings of humans. Yes there were some shocking scenes, for a few seconds, just enough to get the idea across. Yes it deals with some adult themes, but only to the extent to tell the story. Nothing explicit, just suggestive. My wife and I both enjoyed it. The character development is better than most movies, though the characters tended to be stereotyped. Still I related to some and cared about their outcomes, which is the point of a good story. It isn't a belly-laugh comedy, but it put a smile on my face. It helps to understand that Aussies don't take life so seriously.",1449532800,,628,4.517543859649122

8573954,4,B00BUBONQU,"Most of the negative reviews here are due to the recommend algorithm used by Amazon. This film shows under some Christian romances and, being Australian, is a little too sexually frank for most of those viewers. There is much less nudity than in a lot of Aussie or Canadian movies though there is a lot of sexual situations, some of them a bit risqu and one of the couples is very young. This film is less about the green card wedding and more about how integral sex and love and honesty are to a successful relationship. It is funny and sad and sweet and occasionally a little shocking but it is well scripted, acted, staged and edited. It is not for those who are easily shocked as there are (very mild) scenes of BDSM, masturbation(out of frame), sex toys and noises. Ratings for movies not distributed to American theaters are voluntary and this is unrated since it is an Aussie film. It would probably rate an ""R"" for adult situations and limited nudity.",1421020800,5,959,4.5491329479768785
