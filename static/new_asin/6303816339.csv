721465,5,6303816339,"This show was relased in 1978 and was a strange little Halloween cartoon........It is a strange one, but it left humerous memories.........ever since I have had my children and they watched it, but it seemed to leave a bigger impression on me since I knew who Gilda Radner was and they never heard of her, none the less, I was so happy that I found this on a DVD format! IT may be too much for the younger age group due to the ""off the wall"" humor, but, young adults will find this very entertaining....I love it!",1287273600,3,513,4.298969072164948
721466,5,6303816339,"I saw this when i was a kid and all i could remember was the hook of the song and the look of it.  They played it back in the day when disney was a real channel and would have a whole holiday section for each month.  this is fantastic. i mean think about it....i went around for over 20 years asking and typing ""witch magic"" just to find it again lol",1285718400,,350,3.8472222222222223
721467,5,6303816339,"I didn't get to see this one very often when I was a kid, but I loved it when I did get the chance.  Back in '02 I looked it up in my library's catalog and reserved it.  My kids loved it, as well.  I always wanted a copy of my own, but when I would look it up on other sites, it was way out of my price range.  Then I tried Amazon.  :D  I'm so glad I did.

The plot concerns Small and Tender, a brother and sister who only want to scare people for Halloween.  When all they do is hear how cute they are, they give up.  While hanging out with their babysitter Bazooie (I think I'm spelling that right), they cry out that they wish they could be a real ghost (Tender) and a real wolfman (Small), what they dressed as for Halloween.  A witch hears their plaintive cries and flies over to their house.  From there, merriment and mistaken identity ensue.  Even Bazooie gets into the act.

Your kids will love this one.  And if you grew up during the seventies as I had, you might enjoy it, too.

As for the physical quality of this VHS tape, the case was beaten up, but the tape itself was in perfect condition.  Some people might not think the price is a good one, but it sure is when you compare how much other sites want for it.",1259539200,,1226,4.0041322314049586
721468,5,6303816339,"When I was 6 or 7 I taped this movie off tv and 20 years later I still watch it every Halloweentime. This is one of my alltime favorite and lesser known Halloween specials. I read someone's extremely p.c. overview of this and how kids really shouldn't see it. All I gotta say is I did when I was little and I certaintly didn't warp me. Some people just need to not take stuff SO seriously line inuendos n such. Just take it for what it is, it's cute and funny and great dough for any young imagination.",1161734400,7,502,4.13265306122449
721469,5,6303816339,"I am lucky enough to own the original release. Gilda Radner's Norma Desmond witch is simply wonderful. This was released in 1978 in a period when people were less uptight and less strangled by political correctness...thank goodness. If you're afraid that your sensitive little darling might be tainted by the look of a seductive cartoon vampiress then they probably shouldn't be celebrating this pagan holiday anyway. It has a wonderful wholesome message that all of us go about out lives in the same old way day after day, and for one night we can be whoever and whatever we want to be. Let the kids watch it I'm sure they will survive and be better for it! I have shown this wonderful gem to family and neighbors for twenty-six years and it is the best sort of halloween tradition.",1130630400,18,783,4.640287769784172

It's one of my family's favorites, right up there with the Great Pumpkin. It is intelligent and original in it's themes and style.  Gilda Radner's performance as the witch is priceless. She holds nothing back in her hilarious portrayal.  The animated expressions and reactions on the witch's face are pure genius. The music and theme song is brilliant as well.
This animated special deserves a quality DVD release.  Hopefully it will one day get the attention it deserves.",1066867200,9,636,4.763636363636364

So you can tell that it made a strong initial impression on me.  The animation is  basic in the extreme, but the backgrounds are quite nice and the character  design of the witch is excellent--some of her facial expressions are  extremely amusing.  (She rather puts me in mind of Gloria Swanson in  ""Sunset Boulevard."")  The script is very funny--I think adults  can enjoy it just as much as children.  Great for watching around  Halloween!  The only drawback to this tape is that it's recorded in EP, the  slowest VHS speed, so the video quality isn't as good as it could be.",940377600,13,709,4.488188976377953

721731,5,6303816339,"In case you haven't guessed, 'Witch's Night Out' is technically the sequel to 'The Gift of Winter,' since it has the same character set in the tale.  But here you'll notice the animation and designs have improved since it's first incarnate.  And Gilda Radner is great as the Witch, while Catherine O'Hara takes up the reigns as Malicious.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The plot is basically simple:  Small and Tender plan on scaring everyone on Halloween with their spooky costumes, while Malicious and Rotten proclaim they hate the holiday itself (though it's not really known why), while Goodly and Nicely decide they should throw a civilized get-together for Halloween in the local 'haunted house.'

Meanwhile, within the house itself resides a witch.  But instead of the pointed hat, broom-riding one, she gives off more of a Gloria Swanson vibe.  Nevertheless, she laments over the fact that nowadays nobody wants her services, as she recalls how she once used to be in demand.  To prove it, she breaks the 'fourth wall' by demonstrating to the audience her powers by transforming her cat into a bat.  But still remains upset because she feels she's now unemployed.  At the same moment, Goodly and Rotten enter the house as they make plans for the party.  Delighted that someone is coming to her house, the Witch makes her own plans to crash the party.

Back on Halloween night, Small and Tender ineffectively attempt to scare the others and it bums them out.  One hilarious moment is when Malicious attempts to serve her odd treats of Sardine Meringues to them.  Disillusioned they await for Bazooey to read them a bedtime story, but refuse to hear a Halloween Story, so he reads them an ersatz tale about a fairy godmother.  Elsewhere at the house, the Witch watches in amazement at the party guests, preparing to cast mischievous spells upon them.

Returning to Small and Tender's bedroom, Bazooey finishes the story, where the two children lament over the fact they could not scare anyone with their costumes.  And wished they could have a fairy godmother, while Bazooey claims there's no such thing.  But as they wish for being a real ghost and werewolf, it's heard by the Witch who is ecstatic she has two calls on one night.  Immediately leaving the party, she heads for Small and Tender's house (by smashing through the window).  When the kids think she's a fairy godmother, Bazooey identifies herself as a witch. (The Witch: Okay, so I'm not the Avon Lady.)  Naturally she grants the kids' wishes to become real spooks, much to Bazooey's lament, until she proves the entire thing is harmless by changing them back.  Then she convinces Bazooey to become a Frankenstein's monster, and changes the kids into their monstrous forms and invites them back to the party.

I'll stop here because I don't want to give the rest of the plot away, but it's one of those timeless classics which puts it up there with 'It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.'  Sadly after it aired in 1972, NBC never rebroadcast it again, and the only time you could see it was on PBS (as a seasonal short for GRETA), or in bits on the Great Space Coaster.  Afterwards, Family Home Entertainment did produce a VHS version of this special, despite fact the cover graphics did not represent the characters accurately on the show.  But what really stands out about this was for a Halloween Special, it was surprisingly family-friendly (of course, if you don't mind seeing how the 'vampire' version of Nicely is portrayed) and had a simple message for what Halloween was supposed to be about.

Overall, this is a fun little special which I would recommend this classic as part of any Halloween collection. Halloween, it's Witch Magic!",1475539200,,3717,4.82018927444795

721995,4,6303816339,"This is an oldschool Canadian Halloween animated special that I remember watching as a kid in the early 1980s (although it first came out in 1979).  I like it, but perhaps it's only due to nostalgia.  None the less, I assume that most people interested in it have already seen it so I'm not going to review the actual show but rather the DVD itself.

The good news - this is the best Witch's Night Out has ever looked.  You can throw away your VHS tapes.  It appears complete, uncropped and presented in it's original aspect ratio of 4:3.  The print is clear and it looks like some restoration was done.  It was probably DNR'd, but unless you are an animation purist or something, you'll probably will be happy with how it looks.  Keep in mind, though, that this a DVD so do not expect a high definition image.  The sound seems fine to me - nothing obviously wrong to complain about.

The bad news - the entire DVD is encoded for widescreen 16:9.  This means that although the main feature (Witch's Night Out) is presented in it's proper 4:3 ratio (with black bars down the side), the actual encoding is done as if it were 16:9.  What does this mean?  Well, it means that the DVD is wasting a little bit of resolution on the black bars down the sides to fill the 16:9 image.  This means there is less resolution available for the actual 4:3 cartoon image.  So although the program looks good, it (probably) could have looked a little better.  The other problem is that the Casper episodes (part of the bonus cartoons) are presented in 16:9 ratio and are cropped top and bottom to fill the widescreen image!  Little if any restoration on any of the bonus cartoons were done.  Casual fans won't care, but anyone seriously looking for these cartoons might want to look elsewhere.  I want to stress that the cropping is only on the bonus cartoons, not on the main feature (Witch's Night Out) which is uncropped and in 4:3 ratio.

The bonus cartoons are:

- Casper The Friendly Ghost - ""There's Good Boos Tonight"" - Cropped.
- Casper the Friendly Ghost - (Couldn't see a title, perhaps the original episode?) - Cropped
- Casper the Friendly Ghost - ""Boo Moon"" - Cropped
- Felix the Cat - Skulls and Sculls - Uncropped
- Four Hoppity Hooper episodes - Uncropped
- Five Space Angel episodes - Uncropped
- Popeye ""Spooky Swabs"" - Uncropped
- Three Stooges - ""Mummies Boys""
- Meany Miny Moe - ""House of Magic"" - Uncropped",1427328000,,2412,4.486238532110092

722058,5,6303816339,"A real Halloween ""Treat""

Witchs Night Out is a truly delightful Halloween special that works on both a kid's and adults level.

For the adults there is a wonderful use of 1970s buzz words to brainstorm to create a truly memorable Halloween Experience, which brings together Community involvement.  The only thing lacking is the use of the word synergy to bring all the big 1970s buzzwords into play . It gleefully satirizes the way business and community leaders talked about problems and solving them.  Additionally there are many funny throw-away lines, that make you think what did she just say?

For kids there is a not very scary witch  think Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard seeking a comback   who gives the kids what they want, their biggest Halloween wishes.  The  moral is be careful what you wish for.  And, like Dorothy in Oz there is a strong desire to get back to home or  normal in the case of the young protagonists.

The animation is brisk and fun and the backgrounds colorful and very fall like.  The characters are not your typical network animation.  In fact this special was made in Canada and features a largely unknown group of vocal talent with two exceptions: the great Gilda Radner as the Witch and Catherine OHara (Kevins mother from Home Alone) as Malicious.

All in all great fun from the first time I saw it on US network TV about 1980 to the present, and the DVD has benefit of a few additional scenes eliminated from an earlier VHS tape version.",1413504000,2,1481,4.66023166023166
722059,4,6303816339,"Gilda Radner voices a bizarre, eccentric old witch in this Canadian production that aired in on NBC in 1978 and later in syndication.

If you're familiar with the artist-driven, independent-style animated films of SESAME STREET, this is a nostalgic throwback to the kind of free-form cartoon style prevalent in the '70s. The characters are usually painted in one color (kind of like Colorforms kits), in a wide range of imaginative countenances.

I seem to remember at least one other special from Leach/Rankin Productions, with some of the same designs and character names (how could I forget Bazooey?). The ""Rankin"" in this case is not Arthur Rankin of iconic holiday special company Rankin/Bass, but animator Isobel Jean Rankin, who co-wrote the film with partner John Leach.

Mill Creek also included a video comic book version of the story plus a handful of Halloween-themed cartoons to round out the package:

722101,5,6303816339,At long last it's on DVD! My kids and I watched this every year on a fuzzy VHS copied off TV. I think it only ran once in our area. It's great to have a cartoon voiced by the late Gilda Radner. The animation is so '70s. And some bits were cut for commercials. Love being able to really see it in its original version.,1412208000,,317,3.8923076923076922
722102,4,6303816339,"Arriving on DVD for the very first time is the 1978 Canadian Halloween special, titled Witch's Night Out, which is a sequel to the 1974 special The Gift of Winter.

Witch's Night Out centers on a witch bringing two children, Small and Tender, along with their babysitter (Bazooey) to a Halloween party that is taking place at the witch's mansion. The witch decides to show them a good time by turning them into a werewolf and Frankenstein's monster. The local citizens aren't too happy about the party and they create a mob to catch any supernatural creature.

As an added bonus there are 10 bonus Halloween episodes:

Casper the Friendly Ghost: There's Good Boos To-Night (1948)

Casper the Friendly Ghost: Boo Moon (1954)

Felix The Cat: Skulls and Sculls (1930)

Hoppity Hooper: Ghost (1964)

Space Angel: The Ghost Crystal Mace (1964)

Popeye the Sailor Man: Spooky Swabs (1957)

New 3 Stooges: Mumies Boys (1966)

Meany, Miny & Moe: House of Magic (1937)

Though I'm a big fan of Halloween, for some odd reason I have never heard of Witch's Night Out before watching this DVD a few days ago. Despite the age of the special the animation holds up nicely. The 10 other cartoons on the DVD are all fun to watch. Spook Swabs is actually the last Popeye the Sailor Man theatrical cartoons released by Paramount Pictures. There's Good Boos To-Night is a one of the best Casper cartoons and it is a little heartbreaking. Boo Moon was originally released in 3D format as a Stereotoon in 1954. Overall, Witch's Night Out is a wonderful animation special and along with the other 10 cartoons, you are guaranteed to have a fun Halloween watching this DVD with your family.

722103,5,6303816339,"Entertaining Halloween story about a witch(voiced by Gilda Radner) who feels Halloween has lost its magic. The animation is crude by today's standards,but if you remember watching this when it first came out,you'll realize that's a huge part of its charm. If only this would be released on dvd!! Highly recommended.. Great for kids!",1410912000,,332,5.166666666666667
722104,4,6303816339,"I wasn't expecting this old Halloween special to be rescued. One Halloween a couple of children wish they could be scary monsters when no one is frightened by their costumes. Enter Gilda Radner as an obliging witch with her magic wand, and you know things aren't going to go right...

If you grew up as a child in the seventies or early eighties, you might have watched this. It's fairly obscure, even for cartoons of this era, and it's weird to boot. All of the characters have names like Small, Tender, Rotten, or Goodly, and they are done up in weird pastel colors and funky seventies-ish style. It's also weirdly adult at times; almost all of the female characters have prominent breasts. and there's some sly adult humor poking fun at do-gooders and nice people. They don't make them like this any more.

The animation is brightly colored and nostalgic, but it's no Pixar film, or even Oliver and Company. The DVD is a good transfer, but the volume seems a little soft. It's about thirty minutes long. You get some extras, too. The case advertises a comic book, but it's a virtual one on the DVD itself, and is only part one of the story. It's too small even on a 32"" TV to read the text, sadly; the art is wonderful, and I'd buy a full comic based on this. They've also thrown in some public domain cartoons to pad out the length. Space Angel is particularly bizarre, as it uses live action mouths on top of traditional animation to poor effect. The rest are nothing particularly special.

You wouldn't be buying this for the extras anyway. If you grew up around the 70's, this is a little nostalgic treat of a cartoon. Now that it's finally available on home video for the first time in twenty years, it makes for a nice trip down memory lane. For everyone else, it's a quirky little Canadian cartoon similar to what Nelvana used to make, and a nice curiosity if not the best of its kind.",1410825600,18,1895,4.471098265895954
722105,5,6303816339,"One of my absolute favorite Halloween cartoons! I remember watching it at my first Halloween party as a kid and it's stuck with me ever since.

However...

The movie's soundtrack cut out during the last part, plus the picture quality wasn't too good.  I wish it were cheaper.

But another seller wanted $200 for this, and I only paid $27.98, including shipping and handling.  I have another copy on VHS, but my VCR finally died.",1383782400,,346,4.796610169491525

Its from the 70's you know?? What were you expecting?? It took me back to when i was 6 yrs. old. My dad recorded it on VHS for me and my sister and we would watch it every year for Halloween until it got destroyed. Now we can watch it every year again thanks to dracdvds! The graphics were just as i remember and the audio was great! Couldn't have asked for it to be any better, its perfect just the way it is. The shipping was extremely fast!!

I am so glad that it was available from this seller.  Delivery was fast and was better than I expected.  The story and animation is very goofy, whimsical and creative; not your average run of the mill Halloween fare.  I look forward to watching this with my granddaughters (but I am going to keep it at MY house for me to enjoy). <smile>  Thank you for making this available to me in my old dotage and to a new generation of kids.",1317427200,,558,4.368932038834951
722544,1,6303816339,"I realized before purchase that this would probably be no more than a VHS to DVD transfer. I just wanted to be able to play this title without pulling out the ol' VCR. Unfortunately, this was a transfer from a bad VHS copy. The killer was that the main theme song  ( during the credits ) was cut off. No sound whatsoever. This was the main reason I wanted this on DVD. The movie sucked, but the theme song was great. I was very disappointed with this purchase, because of the quality of the transfer. There seemed to be no REAL effort in 'cleaning' things up a bit. Maybe they could, maybe not.. no biggie. I was also appalled by the use of a screenshot form 'The Wizard of OZ' as the main menu backdrop. The trailers were only from our old childhood favorites 'Fright Night' and 'Dawn of the Dead'. They too were from a very bad VHS transfer. The bonus movie.. well, no difference there. Just and old 'Garfield Halloween Adventure' cartoon. Like I said, I was not expecting HD quality, but for $25 total, I was hoping for a little better copy of this show. Wasn't this supposed to the the 'SPECIAL EDITION'? Been checking out the DracDVD website to see if I could find more rare titles, but after this experience, I suspect this is just someone making a quick buck off old damaged VHS tapes. Will not be buying again. Fortunately I still have my original copy on VHS (factory copy)which sounds and looks great. I'll do my own transfers from now on.

It's a Halloween special that has been out since the late 70's,  however in the last 20 years it has become somewhat forgotten.  A real shame.  The story is simple, a few children want a real Halloween experience, except being turned into monsters is only fun for a little while-- especially when fleeing from a mob of adults on a monster hunt.  Kids and adults(at least those who grew up watching it) will find this to be an entertaining show.  don't expect to find it streaming online, copyright holder for this one is very vigilant.  hopefully the special will be released again soon, but i'm not holding my breath.",1287964800,,787,4.618705035971223
