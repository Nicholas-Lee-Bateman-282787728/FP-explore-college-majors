8420540,5,B004AMNN12,"Reena Roy plays the character of a woman who has an out-of-wedlock relationship with a guy (Raj Kiran), who then disappears. She is terrified to find out that she is pregnant and tries to kill herself, but is saved by her room-mate/friend (Rita Bhaduri), but losses the child. She later marries a humane person (Shashi Kapoor) who knows about this and understands that a nave person can make a mistake and deserves compassion, although he does not say anything to her so as not to humiliate her. Things are happy for a while until a man appears (Naseeruddin Shah) who has a photograph of her and her former lover and tries to blackmail her by threatening to reveal all to her husband unless she gives him lots of money. Raj Kiran also comes back into her life to explain why he suddenly left and tries to deal with the blackmailer because he knows that he was equally responsible for what happened and she should not be the only one to suffer. Rita Bhaduri is aghast to find out that it is none other than her husband who is the blackmailer and who has been making life hell for her friend.

Good performances by all. Nice ""feel-good"" story. The last stanza of the song ""har ek jeevan hai ek kahani"" moved me to tears.",1389052800,,1218,4.461883408071749
