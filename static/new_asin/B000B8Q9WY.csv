8083592,3,B000B8Q9WY,"This film seeks to demystify male sex work in Southeast Asia.  This was made in the 1980s, years before the liberal 1990s, quite a pioneer for its time.  Coming before debates over a gay gene, this film focuses upon men who are ""gay for pay.""  It shows that some of them keep secrets from their loved ones, but other relatives clearly know this trade is what keeps roofs over their families' heads.  This film doesn't break down into white clients and yellow hustlers, the Japanese are shown as interested clients as well.  Still, this film shows there are campy, gay-identified men in the Islands.  For those who like masculine, homoerotic imagery, this has lots of it.  I have concerns that just like Africa's ""Dakan"" and South America's ""Don't Tell Anyone,"" this film seems to suggest that the love of a white or white-looking woman can cure gay desire or action among men of color.  Very problematic.  This film also touches upon serious issues like urban migration, poverty, and female prostitution.  Students may want to view this film alongside of reading books by Altman and Manalansan.",1134172800,3,1094,4.864864864864865
