7954161,5,B00005U2SH,"The DVD of ""Richard Rodgers: The Sweetest Sounds"" I had had for years was damaged (in fact, it arrived damaged although I realized it too late), and I was lucky to find another, undamaged used copy. It is a brilliant documentary, and of course the music in it is beautiful. And for the first time, I was able to see parts that in the past the DVD player had glided over. The seller's and my correspondence about this DVD's condition was completely satisfactory. So -- thanks!

One thing: It's a shame that this DVD has not been reissued. Richard Rodgers is really THE American composer -- not that one doesn't love Irving Berlin too. But that he and Oscar Hammerstein took on the great, and even shameful, themes in our country's life, and made people do a little thinking, would be a good thing for more of us to know about. A wonderful way to learn a bit of history --.",1512864000,,871,4.409937888198757
7954162,5,B00005U2SH,"I initially saw this documentary on PBS.
At that time, a ""must have"" saw it was available and life called me away. I returned 1 year later to find a new copy - nowhere to be found! Heartbroken, I went to all my ""Alert! Let me know if you get a new copy in..."" 3 sites and Amazon.  When alerted infrequently, NEW copies ranged from this one $23. and on this site one NOW for reasons beyond me so much more $. I also bought one left , new as well on eBay, why 2? Because I LOVE THIS DOCUMENTARY SO MUCH I HAVE VIEWED IT MANY TIMES. One never tires of the music of course melodies we all hum. Richard Rodger's complexity and his relationships with both Hart and Hammerstein telling.  I seek new copies at more or less the price I paid not 5x price I paid. I give them as gifts to those who love Broadway shows and the days of romance and musicals possibly making a come back?
I thank Amazon for the availability and price I paid. I hope future copies are made available in same range. Just a bittersweet story.",1490400000,,1007,4.13265306122449
7954163,5,B00005U2SH,I really had not  plumbed the depths of this wonderful composer. This DVD does it all. If you love the American Musical this is for you!,1362528000,,136,4.230769230769231
7954164,5,B00005U2SH,"My daughter and I are long time fans of Rodgers and his collaborators so we had an idea that we would enjoy this disc.  Enjoyment seems too small a word though.  There is so much insight into the man that it enhances our appreciation of his music.  Not a perfect person; but a master at creating and adapting music to help the lyrics communicate their message to the utmost. Also, there are fascinating insights into the relationships with Hart and Hammerstein and what made them work so well together. They embodied the best of musical theater in our country and drove it higher I think. Since they have no counterparts today, it's a blessing we have this disc available to enjoy.",1254787200,,681,4.6115702479338845

Words & Music by Richard Rodgers & Oscar Hammerstein II

One of my favorite composers, the brilliant Richard Rodgers, known as the ""Broadway Baby"" had been composing music since age nine and by eighteen had his first Broadway show. Having written 900 some melodies for more than 70 shows in a career that spanned for seven decades, he was one of the most prolific composers of all-time in the league with George Gershwin, Cole Porter and Irving Berlin.

If you're a fan of his music, you'll love this documentary narrated by Tony Roberts about his celebrated life as a composer. His collaborations with two of the most talented lyricists in American music history, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II, resulted in the most remarkable and most-loved musicals of all-time. He had also briefly collaborated with Stephen Sondheim.

The highlights are archival snippets from performers Frank Sinatra (I Could Write A Book and The Lady Is A Tramp), Julie Andrews (The Sound of Music), Louis Armstrong (You'll Never Walk Alone), composer/arranger/pianist Richard Rodney Bennett and singer Marie Cleer Haran (Manhattan and The Lady Is A Tramp), Mel Torme (Blue Moon - his biggest hit), Lena Horne and Lionel Hampton (Where Or When), Barbara Peters (My Romance), pianist Barbara Caroll (My Funny Valentine), John Coltrane (My Favorite Things), Gordon McRae (Oh What A Beautiful Morning), Barbra Streisand (Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered), Jan Clayton and John Raitt (If I Loved You), and Diahann Carroll (""No Strings"" 1962 Tony Award for Best Actress In A Musical). The show ""No Strings,"" Richard Rodgers wrote both the music and lyrics himself and for the first time in Broadway history, the orchestra had no strings section.

This documentary also features film clips and interviews with his daughters, Linda Rodgers and Mary Rodgers, Julie Andrews, Maureen Mc Govern, Max Wilk (writer), Ethan Morden (theater historian), Jonathan Schwartz (music historian), John Mauceri (conductor), Andrew Lloyd Webber (composer), Barbara Cook (singer), and his grandson, Adam Guettell, among others.

His very first show ""The Garrick Gaieties"" was a hit and over the next five years, 15 Rodgers & Hart shows made it to Broadway, ""Spring Is Here,"" ""America's Sweetheart,"" ""The Girl Friend"" and ""On Your Toes,"" to mention a few.

According to narrator Tony Roberts, ""By the end of the 1920's, you couldn't even think of popular songs without talking about Rodgers & Hart. Everyone wanted their music."" As a young man, he loved to watch Jerome Kern shows and he once told lyricist Sheldon Harnick that ""his God was Jerome Kern.""

After his marriage to Dorothy, Hollywood opened its door to Rodgers & Hart with the invention of talking pictures. While he was in Hollywood, he missed his family so much and of course, Broadway. One of his daughters said: ""My father wrote my mother that he was experiencing an intense feeling of depression."" His daughters' periodic visits to Hollywood eased his depression.

These are some of the most remarkable quotes I've transcribed from the interviews:

""He does very subtle things that make the tunes unique."" ~ John Mauceri ~

""When he was writing there were very strict rules: no singing, no whistling, no noise."" ~ Linda Rodgers ~

""Rodger's wife, Dorothy, knew that she was just number two in his life. Theater was his first love.""  ~ Theodore S. Chapin, Rodgers & Hart Organization ~

""My father grew up with a lot of fear and anxiety. He was afraid of heights, planes, tunnels. He was very unhappy unless he was writing."" ~ Mary Rodgers ~

""His music is amazing, stunning, life changing melodies - little Rodgers' factory of melodies from the early twenties until he died. To me, there has been no greater composer in the world than Richard Rodgers. ~ Jonathan Schwartz ~

Mr. Rodgers, who had a reputation of writing melodies so quickly, died of cancer of the larynx on December 30, 1979.

Indeed, Richard Rodgers' wonderful music will live in the hearts of those who truly appreciate tuneful melodies that he brilliantly created. He was truly an exceptional and a very prolific composer.

""If somebody wants to sing my songs after I'm gone, nobody will be happier than my dead body.""  ~ Richard Rodgers ~",1164585600,12,4438,4.95822102425876
7954166,4,B00005U2SH,"Featuring in depth interviews with friends, family and co-workers as well as rare film clips of Rodgers shows such as ""No Strings"", ""Pal Joey"" and ""Babes and Arms"", this is a very well done documentary.

Although it doesn not cover the era of Rodgers and Hammerstein as fully as it covers the era of Rodgers and Hart (perhaps because of Hart's horrific and awful fall into the world of alchohal and depression), it does give us information about the man. Besides being a musical genius, Richard Rodgers had many demons. However, when he was working on a show, he truly produced The Sweetest Sounds.",1139270400,6,598,4.75
7954167,5,B00005U2SH,"The only way to describe the musical composition of Richard Rodgers is that he was a genius, it's just that simple.  In every age is seems like we are visited by someone who just seems to have a certain gift, an ability to communicate in an artistic medium such as music, so that all can understand.  As Mozart wrote popular music of his own time, (it is the ages that have determined this to be called the classics), it is Richard Rodgers music that the future ages will consider classics.  This is not so hard to imagine, considering Oklahoma still draws sells out shows in a revival of the musical, and it first premiered over 60 years ago, his music will transcend the ages.  One could ask, how could this beautiful music come from a depressed, hypochondriac with a drinking problem, then I will simply respond with Mozart.  Mozart had many of the same human frailties as Richard Rodgers, or Visa Versa.  Like Mozart, Rodgers was also something of a prodigy getting his first show to Broadway by the age of 18.  In short, this program captures the essence of this genius.  You probably won't keep a dry eye while watching, the experience is just that moving, but when it is over, you will know that you have visited the presence of greatness.  In addition to having a tremendous respect for Richard Rodgers, you may find your faith in the human endeavor renewed just a bit, remembering the greatness that the human mind and spirit can achieve.",1096329600,7,1447,4.599221789883268
7954168,5,B00005U2SH,"The few other ""reviews"" seem more paeans, eulogies to Rodgers, all deserved, but with little about the documentary, which I liked.  Larry Hart was my first hero.  Keats my second.  But that's beside the point.  I consider Richard Rodgers the finest composer (and he himself preferred the word ""composer"" to ""songwriter"") America has yet (and it seems, will ever) produced.  After Hart died and Hammerstein took over, the life and lively interest seemed to go out of Rodgers' music, it seemed to become bland and simplistic, consider his chords as well as his tunes.  But in his first show after Hammerstein died (also young, like Hart, though not AS young), the magic returned.  This of course was ""No Strings"" for which Rodgers wrote his own words, and very good ones I thought.  The plot, incidentally, is a love affair between a black woman and a white man, and the show was driven out of the south.  (America is a very Christian country, as you know, especially in the south.)  I saw this show live in SF, and it is my favorite Rodgers' score.  Hart, incidentally (I don't remember whether the film stated this) was homosexual.  I especially wanted to mention this and the plot of ""No Strings"".  Bigotry should stop where another person's life begins.  In the film, it was with sad horror that I saw Rodgers in his dotage so sick and ravaged he didn't even look human.  But consider all those wonderful years that came before, genius, songs, work and more work.  And he loved it.  I had only a few, very few, quibbles with this abbreviated documentary.  Mary Cleere Haran sang snippets of Rodgers & Hart songs (frequently), and she changed words and tunes so grossly it was enraging.  And I do not like Frank Sinatra.  No one should.  Ella Fitzgerald recorded a collection of Rodgers & Hart songs (it's on CD, don't buy it), but alas she changes words and music so frequently it is very unhappy.  She also, incidentally, recorded a Gershwin collection (also on CD) which, if you like George and can put up with Ira, you might enjoy, she sings all the tunes the way they were written.  Her doo-wah-dee-wahs, stylizations and lyric changes are things I just can't handle (not from any singer, Streisand, given the reins, does it too), but when she sings straight, there is simply none better.  I do NOT think Ella does this out of conceit or arrogance, it is just her style.  It's been said that Rodgers wrote only one jazz tune (""Red Hot Momma"" for ""Pal Joey""), but as the film amply demonstrates, his tunes and chords fit jazz like a glove.  Hart is simply the best lyricist the English language in any century and NOT excluding Byron has ever produced.  And Rodgers the best 20th Century American tunesmith.  The film, very unfortunately, was too short, was forced to glib over too much and flatly omit tons and tons of things I would have liked to have known or reveled in.  And I would, of course, have infinitely preferred more Hart, although Hammerstein got no more than Hart did, which I was happy about.  But (sigh) it was deeply informative and entertaining for what it could accomplish, and I would massively recommend it to anyone remotely interested in the subject.  Incidentally, many years ago I saw a British (why is it always the British doing this?) bio/retrospective on Lorenz Hart which was wonderful and which I would very much like to see again and to own a copy of.",1068940800,11,3390,4.66610455311973
7954169,5,B00005U2SH,"If you have to choose between this visual document and the biography released in november,don't hesitate to buy the video or dvd. Why? Because it's the facts that are featured here and not the gossips of which no word should be said at all. The daughters of Mr. RODGERS: LINDA and MARY talked about their father's complex personnality and say along the way that the music was more emotional than the man. The portrait of LORENZ HART is also interesting; Mr. RODGERS's patience with LORENZ shows the compassion of a man who knew the value of a partnership. Personnaly, because I am a huge RODGERS and HART fan, I really liked this segment a lot. Those were the days of the AMERICA we like best, between the two world wars.  So many of AMERICA's greatest achievement in music happened during those years. 90 minutes of RICHARD RODGERS who was the greatest composer of his time is certainly worthy of your time. This visual biography was first shown on PBS last autumn.",1009065600,25,966,4.649122807017544
