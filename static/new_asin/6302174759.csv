Quake was an OK movie & worth watching once. It seemed more like a movie off the Lifetime channel but still worth watching. If it didn't have a little bit of nudity then you'd swear it was off the network. I almost gave up on the movie once (I have no reason why) but I'm glad I stuck around because the twist that happened before the end was worth sticking around for & just when you thought it was over...... If it did end then & there then it would've ended perfectly but I figured the movie must go on. Steven Railsback was GREAT as the psychotic nut job neighbor next door. There were a few times where he truly creeped me out. I know he's been in alot of movies before but I never really noticed him until now. This movie makes me want to go out & look for more of his stuff. If you ever happen to come across Quake then I'd say give it a watch. It's not a bad way to spend 1 Hour & 25 Minutes",1489017600,,1041,3.985645933014354
7823117,1,6302174759,"AFTERSHOCK (1989) - Low-budget post-apocalypse actioner from director Frank Harris (KILLPOINT - 1984; LOW BLOW - 1986; THE PATRIOT - 1986) that has a good B-movie cast, but the storyline is nothing but rehashed themes from countless other post-nuke epics. The worldwide devastation is not caused by nuclear war, biological warfare or another man-made disaster this time, but by a series of off-the-Richter Scale earthquakes, which have reduced the Earth to nothing but a pile of rubble (most of this film looks to have been filmed in some abandoned industrial park). The world is now ruled by an oppressive dictatorship led by Commander Eastern (Richard Lynch), who has his second-in-command, Captain Quinn (John Saxon), and his army search out and kill ""unregistered humans"" from their hiding places (Nearly all humans have an identifying barcode tattooed on their arms and this film doesn't hide the comparison to Jews during the Nazi occupation in WW II). During one of these raids, a female alien named Sabina (Elizabeth Kaitan) appears in a burst of light and is captured by Quinn's army. When Quinn notices that Sabina has no barcode and her bright red outfit is made out of some unknown metal, he becomes intrigued, especially when he discovers that she is carrying some photos and patches with her (one photo is of Nancy Reagan!). It seems Sabina is a blank slate, but she is a very quick learner (She learns English by reading a dictionary/thesaurus on a 5.25"" floppy disk!) and becomes more knowledgeable when Quinn sends her to a laboratory to be observed and get a psych work-up. Meanwhile, sword-carrying and motorcycle-riding loner Willie (Jay Roberts Jr.) travels the barren landscape looking for a cause he can believe in. He stops at a bar run by Hank Franklin (Russ Tamblyn) and is arrested by Quinn's right-hand man Mr. James (James Lew, also the Stunt Coordinator) when he tries to defend an underground female freedom fighter. He is brought to the same facility where Sabina is being held and, after a series of events, he escapes with Sabina and fellow prisoner Danny Girrard (Chuck Jeffries, doing his best Eddie Murphy impression). They steal a car and end up at the underground base of freedom fighter leader Colonel Slater (Christopher Mitchum), who has a history with Willie. Commander Eastern orders Quinn to bring back Sabina no matter what the cost because the tests they performed on her in the lab proves that she is an alien (and a newborn one to boot!), so Quinn hires top-notch ""Apprehender"" Brandt (Chris DeRose) to bring her back alive and kill everyone else. This leads to a series of chases, fights and shootouts, as Willie tries to protect Sabina while falling in love with her (Ewwww! He's falling in love with an alien baby!). Willie must return Sabina to her original entry point before time runs out or else she will die. The remainder of the film details Willie's efforts to get Sabina off the planet so she can stop the Earth from being destroyed. From what I just witnessed, our planet is better off without us.  There's not much to recommend here except watching a bunch of talented actors trying to keep a straight face while spouting groan-inducing dialogue. The screenplay, by Michael Standing (who also gives himself the role of Gruber, Colonel Slater's right-hand man), is nothing but a mishmash of post-nuke clichs, most of them done much better in the Italian post-apocalypse rip-offs of the early-to-mid-80's (The only funny bit comes when Quinn tells Brandt that Willie's barcode scanned as a ""can of Chinese mushrooms manufactured in Taiwan in the year 1987. Obviously a mistake.""). The action scenes, including the car chases, fight scenes and gun battles, are strictly second-rate and the violence is rather subdued for an R-rated flick (Not to mention that Ms. Kaitan has no nude scenes). Director Frank Harris takes a lazy approach to nearly every aspect of this film, which may be why he gave up directing and is mainly a cinematographer now (he photographed the reprehensibly bad TRANSFORMED in 2003). AFTERSHOCK is the equivalent of eating a bad Chinese meal. Not only will you be hungry again one hour later, you'll still have an awful taste in your mouth that just won't seem to go away (Maybe it's from that can of Chinese mushrooms from 1987!). Michael Berryman and Matthais Hues put in extended cameos as two muscle-headed idiots named Queen and Cassidy who kidnap Sabina towards the end of the film. Berryman wears bright red lipstick and, at one point, dons a bright red wig, which makes him looks like a freakish drag queen. Originally available on VHS from Prism Entertainment/Paramount Home Video and available on a no-frills fullscreen DVD from Image Entertainment. Rated R.",1369958400,,4750,4.959849435382685
7823118,5,6302174759,"Taking place in SanFrancisco the year of the Oakland worldseries, a sexy female lawyer (Erika Anderson) is knocked unconscious in an earthquake. Then kidnapped by a psychopath played by Steve Raisback.  His intensions are to keep her as his prisoner and she must do whatever it takes to escape. This film was very exciting although being a B-movie, but I must admit it was better then most of the films in the movie theater. The acting is not bad,and Raisback is quite entertaing as the psychopath. I recommend this to anyone who likes suspense thrillers.",992476800,7,555,4.842105263157895
