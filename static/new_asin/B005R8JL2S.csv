Sanders as you may know has played roles as the Falcon and The Saint series in the movies in which he played a society detective.  Unfortunately, Mr. Sanders is a scoundrel and thief at best.  He is a wonderful actor who can portray the good and evil characters superbly.  The remaining cast is very supportive to give you an evening of drama.",1406592000,,506,4.5777777777777775
8484192,5,B005R8JL2S,"This is an excellent film. I only got to see it twice on tv. The programming people never schedule it. They keep repeating the same classic films. I have over 1,500+ films in my collection. If I want to watch inherit the wind or any early eastwood films all I have to do is go to my collection. It is very well done film noir.",1406592000,,326,4.030769230769231
