5463572,4,B00AP2DD7K,"World Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Big Show - Show came out aggressive with Lawler commenting that he was like ""a bull in a china shop"" as he went right after Del Rio with various hard chops & strikes while Del Rio kept trying to bring Show down with a leg buster & kicks to the face that knocked Show down to his knees but Show was able to keep coming after Del Rio with a spear & Vader Bomb.  Del Rio was able to catch Show in the cross armbreaker but Show was large enough to make it to the ropes which didn't stop Del Rio as he was able to keep countering Show's attempts at various holds like the powerbomb & chokeslam while Show did the same with another attempt at the cross armbreaker.  This was a good match as Del Rio wasn't backing down while Show definitely came off as a giant beast with the only negative thing to say was the botch at the end.

United States Champion Antonio Cesaro vs. The Miz - Miz came into this match with his shoulder taped based off the attack on RAW which was quickly targeted by Cesaro with various holds like the shoulder breaker & many stretches & locks directly on his arm.  Miz did catch a break with Cesaro going into the steps knee first which Miz then focused on with a dropkick & setup for the figure four.  This was a solid match with both men telling a story about focusing on a body part with the other guy selling it well but the only negative I can really say is that the weak finish which setup the stipulation rematch on RAW.

Elimination Chamber Match: Chris Jericho vs. Randy Orton vs. Kane vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Mark Henry vs. Jack Swagger - John Cena already declaring that he was facing the WWE Champion at Wrestlemania by winning the Royal Rumble so this was to determine who would have the World Champion at the event with Jack Swagger & Zeb Colter, complete with new theme music, being a pre-match promo.  Various highlights include Chris Jericho & Daniel Bryan starting the match off, Swagger's aggressive dominance, the interaction between Team Hell No, a rare occurrence where all six men where active in the chamber at one time, Mark Henry being as Michael Cole would call it ""the poster boy for annihilation"" causing many unlikely alliances, one superstar going through the pod glass, and Randy Orton's performance.  Everyone had a moment to shine in this match resulting in a really good Chamber match.

John Cena, Ryback, Sheamus vs. The Shield - Cena's team didn't wait for the Shield to come to the ring as they got to them before the match started after they made their way to the ring over the barricade brawling in & out of the ring including a triple vertical suplex.  Both teams traded momentum with Sheamus & Cena gaining momentum taking on each member one at a time before The Shield would regain & keep control with teamwork between two or all three members including isolating Cena away from his teammates keeping him in their half of the ring or taking out one member of the team when they were focused on another.  Nice six man tag with an extra credit going to J.B.L. on commentary as the point he kept making throughout the contest was played out during the match in that, ""Cena & Sheamus & Ryback were allies but The Shield is a team.""

Kofi Kingston vs. Dolph Ziggler - After Dolph complained about not having a match on the show, Booker T gave him this match against Kofi who came in hot such as delivering a monkey flip that turned Dolph inside out landing him on his face before Dolph recovered trying to keep Kofi down with moves like his sleeper hold.  Big E. Langston made his presence known causing Kofi to focus on him various times such a suicide dive & top rope dive along with a crossbody into the ring on Dolph before it was one high risk too many that quickly opened the door for Dolph to capitalize.  This wasn't the high quality as their previous matches over the years were as this match was pretty quick but a non-stop athletic match.

Divas Champion Kaitlyn vs. Tamina Snuka - This was just an average match but nothing noteworthy or special past pushing the fact that the divas have a target on Kaitlyn being the champion as you saw all the divas backstage watching the monitor during the match.

WWE Champion The Rock vs. C.M. Punk - The stipulation for this match is that The Rock would lose the championship if he was disqualified or counted out while C.M. Punk came to ringside with the WWE Championship he took from Rock on RAW earlier in the week.  Punk was briefly in control early before Rock started to gain it back causing Punk to go to the floor to break his momentum as Punk then focused on taking advantage of the stipulation by slapping & spitting in Rock's face trying to get him to lose his temper while taunting him before grounding Rock while also delivering some impactful blows like the Savage Elbow, a knockout kick to the head, and his own Rock Bottom on the spanish table that didn't give.  They traded momentum from here as Rock delivered the samoan drop while Punk pounded Rock down with repeated elbows along with dueling fist between the both of them before the action really picked up with their signature moves of Rock Bottom & G.T.S. with Paul Heyman & the referee getting caught in the line of fire as well.  While I enjoyed their first encounter, I enjoyed this one even more as it's a rare case with the ""champion loses title on DQ/count out"" actually working in a positive way instead of against the match while it was a performance where the loser was was put over heavily during the match were he did look like he would have won the championship.  Really great main event here.

In the end, there wasn't a bad match here but there were some matches that don't have a replay value for one reason (Miz/Cesaro only here to set up the No DQ match the next night on RAW) or just wasn't anything special (Divas) but the rest of the card was solid & better overall card than the previous year so I would recommend this for a viewing.",1361664000,,5966,4.4301369863013695
5463573,4,B00AP2DD7K,"The Worlds title match between Alberto Del Rio & The Big Show was well wrestled but had a sour ending. The United States title match between Antonio Cesaro & The Miz was not great but pretty good with a pretty clever finish too. The Elimination Chamber match(Randy Orton vs Chris Jericho vs Kane vs Daniel Bryan vs Jack Swagger vs Mark Henry) was a smash-mouth,hard-hitting,brutal brawl. The 6 man tag team match between The Shield(Seth Rollins,Roman Reigns & Deam Ambrose) against the team of John Cena,Ryback & Sheamus was a nice,solid & back-and-forth tag bout. The Impromptu match between Kofi Kingston & Dolph Ziggler was just filler and that's that. The Divas title match between Kaitlyn & Tamina Snuka while not bad,it was short and relatively uneventful. The WWE title match between The Rock & CM Punk was similar to their Royal Rumble bout but with a wonky finish(But still good). I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1361232000,2,920,4.75625

From what ive heard their match at the royal rumble was great, so it should be entertaining to see live on ppv. Besides that i would prefer this ppv over wm 29 bc i don't want to see cena vs rock 2, it was called once in a life time match for a reason! But i will buy wm 29 on dvd bc cena and rock was fun to watch but not for another $60 when i can get it cheaper on dvd and see the same match as much as i want! Lol",1360886400,,586,3.622047244094488

5463577,4,B00AP2DD7K,"World Champion Alberto Del Rio VS Big Show: This match is like the rest of the PPV, it's good but it's just like watching either Smackdown or Raw.

US Champion Antonio Ceasaro VS Miz: Decent, tv style match with a cheap DQ ending.

Elimination Chamber Match with Orton, Jericho, Bryan, Kane, Henry, & Swagger: I remember Swagger use to be a jobber for months before leaving WWE for sometime & too come back with Zeb Coulter. Then he got arrested for drugs & his big push came to a halt. This was a decent chamber match, very boring in some spots & with all the talent in the ring. Swagger wins via roll-up but his push would soon to coming to an end.

The Shield VS Cena, Ryback, & Sheamus: It's hard to believe people were chanting Ryback. This was a very good match as usual with the Shield but how many times can you replay the same six man tag match in one year?

Kofi Kingston VS Dolph Ziggler: This was a bonus match but the same thing you'd see if you tuned into The Main Event.

WWE does hate I hate most, trying to make people download the WWE app in a very corny segement with the annoucers. Then in other segement I can't stand, they try to sell toys to the little kiddies with Tons of Funk & those two chicks.

Tamina Snuka VS Kaityln: I don't know why this went on before the main event.

WWE Champion The Rock VS CM Punk: The Rock's whole comeback is probably the worst in WWE history. The five matches he's had have all sucked. He & Punk have no chemistry together & the Royal Rumble match was a complete joke espeically when the lights went out & The Shield attacked the Rock. Anyways, this match was slow & very boring. The two ref bumps were eye rolling. Ending saw Punk hit Heyman with the belt then walk into a Rock bottom for the lose.

Overall, the card was a basic Raw or Smackdown. The only difference is an Elimination Chamber match & The Rock wrestling. Good event but not worth paying the PPV price when you can see it for free on tv.",1388534400,3,1961,4.224598930481283

ELIMINATION CHAMBER 2013

The road to Wrestlemania continues as this event is set up to get the challenger for which ever title challenger was not determined by the Royal Rumble.

1.[WORLD TITLE]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS THE BIG SHOW-this was a really good opening match as these two went at it once again. Show was all over Rio with power moves and holds while Del Rio countered a lot here and kept going for that arm-bar. Show even landed a Vader Bomb for those that remember that but Del Rio was too much for him as Show had to tap to another arm-bar.

2.[US TITLE]ANTONIO CESARO VS THE MIZ-this was a good match for the US title with two guys who don't get enough credit. Miz had been injured on Raw so he came to the ring bandaged up. This of course meant Cesaro targeted that shoulder of  Mizs. But Miz would fight back to the point where Antonio would have to resort to saying he was kicked with a low blow to retain his title.

3.[ELIMINATION CHAMBER]CHRIS JERICHO VS KANE VS DANIEL BRYAN VS RANDY ORTON VS MARK HENRY VS JACK SWAGGER- Jericho and Bryan started this match out and have a good back and forth before Swagger enters the fray. Things get a little more physical from there and all three battle it out until Bryans partner Kane comes in. This leads to an interesting moment for the tag team which as always is entertaining. Orton enters next and starts taking to everyone that is until Mark Henry smashes him through one of the chamber pods. The action is fast paced of course and once the eliminations start they keep coming. The ending happens fast and Swaggers gets the very quick win in the end.

4. JOHN CENA, SHEAMUS, & RYBACK VS THE SHIELD-this may have been the most fun match as one of my favorites. Both teams did well here and went back and forth with The Shield controlling a little more so than Cena and company. The Shield of course is the better team here and works together better isolating Cena for most of the match and working him over. The ending gets wild and leads to a great spear that takes out Ryback giving The Shield the win here.

5. KOFI KINGSTON VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-this was an added bonus match after Dolph came out stating he should have had a match on this card. Booker T gave him his wish as he brought out long time rival Kofi to square off against him. This was a quick fast paced match that made both guys look god. Dolph would end up winning it after Big E and AJ get involved.

6.[DIVAS TITLE]KAITLYN VS TAMINA-this was your typical quick Divas match in which Kaitlyn kept the belt [Texas represent]. It wasn't a bad match but was nothing special either to be honest.

7.[WWE TITLE]THE ROCK VS CM PUNK-the rematch that everyone knew was just one more match to get Rock to Mania against Cena. That of course made me mad since I still feel Punk should have still been champion. Any way this is a good match with Punk going all out here to get the belt back. He even delivers a Rock bottom onto Rock through the announcers table. The action is back and forth but in the end The Rock retains the title as we all knew he would.

BONUS

1. TEAM RHODES SCHOLARS VS BRODUS CLAY & TENSAI-this was the free match on the countdown that night that led into the PPV. This was a good match and I actually was happy to see TRS back in action. Clay and Tensai get the win here in a quick but fun match.

2. JOHN CENA, SHEAMUS, RYBACK VS 3MB-this was a squash match that help put over Cenas team. They basically smash 3MB but there was a cool moment at the end. They all did their finishers at the same time to end the match, that was cool. This was on the RAW before the PPV

3. ALBERTO DEL RIO VS DAMIEN SANDOW-this while quick was actually a good match. Sandow looked good here for a short time before he had to tap out to the armbar. This was another quick match from that same RAW.

4. BIG SHOW VS CHRIS JERICHO-this match was the main event from Smackdown before the PPV. This is a good one that sees Jericho doing well against the big man. There is a choke slam that Show delivers here that is nasty but it is his knockout punch that secures him the win.

For other bonus features you get an interview with Swagger that night and various moments from RAW and Smackdown. Over all this was a good event and any wrestling fan should pick it up for the collection.",1384732800,3,4301,4.286066584463625
5463579,3,B00AP2DD7K,"Great ending to a PPV. But the build up is horrible. The chamber match was weak and so was the rest of the show. Only thing to look forward to was The Rock defending the title.

5463583,4,B00AP2DD7K,"World Heavyweight Championship: Alberto Del Rio (C) vs. BIg Show

What you expect from both competitors.  No big surprises, but a decent match.

3.0/5

Cena, Ryback and Sheamus vs. The Shield

The ending is a little hard to call.  It's good in the sense that it's not what's expected, but sucks in that it shouldn't have happened.

3.0/5

Elimination Chamber: Kane vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Mark Henry vs. Jack Swagger

Good match.  Team Hell No has their usual banter.  Henry has a solid showing, as does Swagger.

3.0/5

Diva's Championship: Kaitlyn (C) vs. Tamina Snuka

Solid match.  I didn't know who Tamina was, but I thought she wrestled just like Jimmy Snuka, and my friend told me it was his daughter.  Kaitlyn has some good moves.

3.5/4

U.S. Championship: Antonio Cesaro (C) vs. The Miz

Good match.  Both nailed their timing and had good in ring fluidity.

4.0/5

WWE Championship match:  The Rock (C) vs. CM Punk

Very good match.  A solid effort by both competitors, although Punk was a little rigid in taking shots.  It was disappointing to see that CM couldn't put Rock through the table.  He lands a very nice elbow drop.  It was good to see The Rock do what he does in prime form.  Match of the night.

5463584,3,B00AP2DD7K,"Well perhaps I'm no longer the type of person the WWE are catering to any more. I've been watching the WWE since I was 7 (called the WWF back then). So I've seen every Elimination Chamber (both events and matches). As an event it was ok. The story lines to me have been done before. The Shield...they were good the first two times when they were called nWo and DX. Oh and one of their opponents...Ryback. It sure is good to see Goldberg back in the ring. So I just had no interest in this match. See because to me, unlike nWo and DX, the Shield haven't proven themselves to me to get the push that they are. Come on, 3 guys from NXT going on AFTER the actual Elimination Chamber match? While we're on the subject, putting the Divas match on after both of those matches? What happened to building up the card. Where you start w/a Divas match, or a U.S. title style match, then build, have the 3 on 3 match, the title match(es) and end w/the Chamber. Instead this event was all over the place. As far as the actual Elimination Chamber match they didn't do anything that hasn't been done before. It annoyed me that Mark Henry eliminated the 3 people I felt should have won. The final 3 just made it so predictable who would win. Gee let me guess, two guys who have already headlined 'Mania against the guy who hasn't. I suppose in that aspect they went the right way. Also, while we're talking about things done right in this event, even though it's the 3rd time now, the Show/Del Rio match was the highlight for me, even though of the 3 matches this one was their weakest outing. I don't know. For the event leading to Wrestlemania I wanted them to...""feed me more"".",1364169600,,1664,4.336538461538462
