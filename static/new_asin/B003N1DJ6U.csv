I would love to own a copy of this amazing story but with either english or spanish subtitles... this is an amazing and very touching story about the ""AIRSTAN INCIDENT"". A group of Russians being forced to land their cargo airplane on Taliban controlled territory in Afghanistan back in 1995 and being held againts their will by twisted minds and how that group of Russians managed to survive that living hell and how they found within them selves  the courage not only to survive but, also to scape over a year after being captive; with and on their same airplane, this movie is amazing! like I said before, I would buy this movie in a minute if I could find it with: english or spanish subtitles.",1378425600,2,813,4.42
