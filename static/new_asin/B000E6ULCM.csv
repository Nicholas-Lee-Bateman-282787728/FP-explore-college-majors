2503135,5,B000E6ULCM,"TNA will be realeasing the new Bloodist Brawls DVD in march. The following is what is scheduled to appear on the DVD along with a five star rating.

-Monster's Ball 1 - Victory Road. This three way match with Raven vs Abyss vs Monty Brown took place in 04 at the first TNA PPV. A decent match that had a few good spots, but the second Monster's Ball is way better. ***1/2

-AMW/XXX Steel Cage - Turning Point. This match is insane. You will be replaying Primetime walking the top of the cage over and over again. Better then there first cage match. *****

-Final Assualt Match- Abyss vs. Jeff Hardy - Destination X. I don't remember if this match was bloody or not. It makes up for the Full Metal Mayhem match from AAO. One of Hardy's better matches. ****

-AJ Styles vs. Abyss - Lockdown. This match took place on the all cage PPV. THe winner got a title shot against Jeff Jarrett. These two guys always put on a great match against each other. *****

-Raven vs. Sean Waltman (House of Fun) - Hard Justice. This was supposed to be Raven vs. Hardy, but Hardy no-showed, so Waltman steped up. I will say that Waltman showed a different side to him and this match is extremely bloody and brutal. *****

-Abyss vs. Raven Dog Collar Match - No Surrender. IMO, this is one of the best title matches I have seen. I wish they would have continued this fued, but they did not. Great spots by both men and once again, tons of blood and brutality. *****

-Raven/Sabu vs. Rhino/Jarrett - Sacrifice. This was not so much a tag team match. The stipulation was if Raven pinned Jarrett, Jarrett would not get a title shot for a year. If Jeff pinned Raven, he got his title shot at the next PPV. This was a great match from what I remember. ****

-Raven vs. Rhino - Unbreakable. These two men put on a great hardcore match at WWF Backlash a few years ago. This was given a no DQ stipulation. This match was better than there match at Backlash and was for the NWA title. *****

-AMW/JJ vs. Rhino/Team 3D - Genesis. This brawl went all over the arena and continued in the ring and if I remember, everyone in this match was bleeding. Really hardcore. ****1/2

-Monster's Ball 2 - Bound For Glory. This match is insane and is One of the best matches on this DVD with some really insane spots. For those intersted in the rest of the PPV, check out my review as it is one of the best PPV's I have seen. *****

(Barbed Wire Massacre) Sabu vs Abyss - Turning Point. This was the first ever Barbed Wire match on American PPV and the first one since the famous Sabu and Funk from ECW. This is really hard to watch at times and you just wonder where these guys find the mental strength to perform in matches like these. Abyss really is one of the true stars of TNA and is a Hardcore legend in the making. This match gets ten stars in stead of the five.

You really are getting a fantastic deal with this DVD, although my only complaint is that I wish they would have added older matches like the 10-man tag team Wargames match from the weekly PPV's. TNA really is on a roll.

Off the topic, if you missed last nights TNA PPV Against All Odds, order the replay. One of the best matches with Christian winning the NWA heavyweight title, the X divison triple threat rematch with Samoa Joe vs Styles vs Daniels and the Falls Count Anywhere match with Rhino and Abyss.",1139788800,16,3336,4.301435406698564
2503136,5,B000E6ULCM,"I just can't understand how people can watch the WWE!

There was a time when WWE was intresting (97-00) but

those days are long gone. At one time the ECW was the

place were ""true"" wrestling fans went to get their fix

(less talking...more blood and violence and talented

wrestlers).

 Well Vince ruined that and now look at the WWE...what

a waste. What talent they do have is wasted in stupid

angles and even lamer matches while Triple H and Vince's

other butt buddies get all the glory.

 Now we have TNA as our final refuge to get quality

wrestling and great young talent. You'd never see anything

like Abyss vs Sabu barbed wire match in the WWE and you'd

see inovation like Ultimate X or a whole PPV that takes

place in a steel cage (LOCKDOWN).

 What's really said is when people try to defend the WWE.

That's what's truely sad!",1139788800,4,843,4.427631578947368

2503169,5,B000E6ULCM,"I was very happy when i got this dvd beause this is just plain awesome with all the match being off the hook and it is almost the best of abyss as he is in 6 of the 10 matches although he loses all of them hum somthing to think about it

monsters ball one abyss vs monty brown vs raven well raven is the reason i bought this but this is not the match i wanted to see the match over is pretty good but just not as great as i thought it would be although it got a this is awesome chant but it is not really that awesome 6.5/10 and someone said that they would have had the raven vs rhino insead of sabu raven vs jeff rhino but it would have been nice to see that insead of this match but the set is great any ways

cage match amw vs xxx the losers have to disband and they put on one heck of a last show although they got back together a few years later but still the crowd says ""best match ever"" and ""this is awesome"" and it was both i could watch it over and over the handcuffs play a great role and so does the high cage this is just great and i mean great i would buy this for this match 10/10

this is not full metal mayhem like the box says but its falls count anywhere jeff hardy vs abyss this match is pretty cool but not the best and jeff hardy gets pink all over abyss tisk tisk and this match for some reason makes me want to watch it and watch but im not to sure 7.5/10

cage match aj styles vs abyss now this match is really cool a lot of the match is outside the cage but aj jumps over the crowd and hit abyss so he can over sell his move and then they get in the cage and it is even better then so yes this match is just another great match 9.5/10

house of fun raven vs sean waltman this is a pretty good match as they both put on a real good match i love this match and the next three but i am sort of bias because raven is my favorite wrestler so sorry im bias but i like this match and when that table spot was botched and waltman fell all the way to the floor from the stage and then raven took a table spot and ravens shoulder was up just a little bit and the ref wouldnt count and raven looks at him like count it is close to the floor and then the ref counted and i thought the finish was pretty cool 8/10

dog collar chain raven vs abyss this is a pretty cool match and raven and abyss put on a great show and then raven staples a $10 bill to abyss's head and he does that weird sell job where jumps on his knees and abyss falls off the stage on two tables and raven falls off through one table and then they get to the ring and abyss takes the collar off and then gets ddt onto tacks and loses again 9/10

sabu and raven vs jeff jarrett and rhino this match is great i think raven cuts jeff with a pizza cutter and there are just solid spots but nothing that sticks out 9.5/10

monsters ball 2 jeff hardy vs abyss vs sabu vs rhino this match rules and they all take hard shots and then jeff goes up and does the coolest bomb ever and then takes a rhino driver in the coolest way 10/10

6 man tag team 3d and rhino vs jarrett and amw this is cool to watch and is really fun to watch but it is not as good as it is fun to watch its a match you like to watch but isn't that great and there are many teased table spots but there are no table spots 7/10

bardwire sabu vs abyss this match rules it is like terry funk and sabu but faster and a little more harcore and there are so many sick spots this match just rules like this set 10/10",1218931200,,3455,3.7927677329624476
2503170,5,B000E6ULCM,"This was the first volume of TNA's Bloodiest brawls collection. This is a way better collection of violent matches then of the Stitches and Scars volume. It starts out with Mike Tenay and Don West telling how violent these matches can be and then they introduce the matches to us.

1. Monster's Ball Match- Victory Road 2004
Abyss vs. Monty Brown vs. Raven
This was the first ever Monster's Ball match and it was a pretty good one. Its starts out very fierce and physical. Brown takes a hard shot to the ring post in the early going. Some good hard impactive moves. The ref even takes a hard shoulder tackle in this one which was a little funny. Some good table spots too. To me that match was more physical than violent but it was a pretty good first of its kind. 4/5

2. Six Sides of Steel- Turning Point 2004
America's Most Wanted vs. Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper
OMG!!!!!! One of the greatest matches ever right here. Fans even chant BEST MATCH EVER at one point in the match. Daniels gets busted open early and it was ugly to say the least. Daniels takes some vicious shots into the cage and he took a lot of them. Harris gets hand cuffed but soon gets unhandcuffed and along with Storm, they really start yo pick things up after that. The true highlight moment of this match was when Skipper walked the top of the cage and then hurricanranas Harris from the top of the cage!!! That was unbelieveable. This is definitely one of those rare hardcore matches that became an instant classic. An OMG match to say the least. 5/5

3. Final Assault Match- Destination X 2005
Jeff Hardy vs. Abyss
From the early going this match went all over the building and even went outside where Hardy and Abyss just brawled each other out. Hardy does the swanton off an about 16 foot steel posts into Abyss through two tables. They would soon fight back to the ring and just beat one each other more. Hardy would bring out a ladder and use his classic Hardy ladder offense onto Abyss. Hardy would then get Black Hole Slammed onto the tacks! It had a good ending with Hardy twist of fating Abyss onto the ladder. Good over all match but not all the violent and bloody though. 4.5/5

4. Six Sides of Steel- Lockdown 2005
AJ Styles vs. Abyss
This match had one of the longest pre matches I ever seen. Styles and Abyss just had a match in itself on the outside of the cage before the match officially started. They fought all in the crowd and at ringside. Styles would leap over about 4 rows of chairs at ringside and hit Abyss with his flying forearm! Styles would then get busted open after Abyss just swung the cage door into Style's face and it was disturbing to say the least. Then that would lead them entering the cage. Styles would take some hard shots but he would Style's Clash Abyss onto thumb tacks and then win the match shortly after that. Very good match. 5/5

5. House of Fun Match- Hard Justice 2005
Raven vs. Sean Waltman (X-Pac)
This match was interesting. A half of a cage was set around the ring and there were weapons hanging on the side of the ring. Waltman and Raven was just brawling the hell out of each other. Raven would handcuff Waltman at one point but it would cause Dusty Rhodes to come out and free Waltman. The insane point of the match was when Waltman stapled Raven's forehead with a stapler! There were some good tables spots as well. Pretty violent and physical match up. 4.5/5

6. Dog Collar Chain Match for the NWA Championship- No Surrender 2005
Abyss w/ James Mitchell vs. Raven
This match got very violent with the steel chain and the steel chairs. Abyss would try to leg drop Raven onto about 5 stacked up chairs but would miss and crash into the chairs. The match had its share of very hard hits too. Some nice hardcore action. 4/5

7. Sacrifice 2005
Jeff Jarrett & Rhino vs. Raven & Sabu
Before this match started, the fans was chanted ECW and that did brought back some memories with Sabu, Rhino, & Raven. This was a pretty hardcore tag match. There were some good nonstop action and some good action on the outside. Good hardcore action. 4/5

8. Monster's Ball 2- Bound for Glory 2005
Jeff Hardy vs. Abyss vs. Rhino vs. Sabu
This was to me the best Monster's Ball match until 2008. This match was tables gallore. There was action taking place everywhere. The fans were really into this one and this was just a great match. Hardy swantons Abyss through a couple of tables off the stage. Hardy even takes a sickening piledriver from Rhino from the top rope. Awesome match. 5/5

9. Anything Goes Tag Match- Genesis 2005
Team 3D & Rhino vs. America's Most Wanted & Jeff Jarrett
Pretty hardcore match up. It felt more like AMW was trying everything they could to not go through the tables. Buh Buh even uses a cheese grater on Storm in this one. Very hardcore. Good six man tag match. 4.5/5

10. Barbed Wire Massacre- Turning Point 2005
Sabu vs. Abyss w/ James Mitchell
This was just gory and violent all the way through. Sabu and Abyss took some sickening shots into the barb wire. Abyss and Sabu get very bloody in this one. Abyss gets crushed between two barbed wire boards. Violent match. Abyss gets a well deserved stand up ovation from the crowd after the match. Bonus footage shows Abyss getting stitches after the match. 4.5/5

This was very violent and bloody dvd. Many of the matches are just that as well. If you're a fan of hardcore style wrestling or you like bloody matches then thia is the dvd for you. Violence all over the place.",1217808000,,5478,4.440796019900498
2503171,5,B000E6ULCM,"This Dvd features basically the most hardcore matches from each pay per view from 2004-2005 except from Final Resolution and Against All Odds. This program shows the very best of TNA in that period. Now, for those who say that WWE sucks right now, they are dead wrong. WWE used to be in a little slump in 2006-early 2007. But now, It is clear that WWE rules the wrestling world. So far this year 5 out of 6 WWE pay per views were 4-5 star ppv's. TNA has had 4-5 pay per views that were either okay or they absolutely sucked. Sacrifice and Lockdown were horrible. Destination X and Slammiversary were alright but nothing more. Against All Odds and Final Resolution were pretty good. Overall, though TNA is the one that is currently in a slump by not pushing their younger guys and just focusing on either former WWE wrestlers or guys who have been in the business for more than 15 years. If you remember, this is exactly what caused WCW to fall. If TNA can focus less on their old guys like Kurt Angle, Scott Steiner, Kevin Nash, Sting, Team 3D, VKM, and Booker T; and focus more on the guys that really did put TNA on the map like Aj Styles, Christopher Daniels (Curry Man), Sonjay Dutt, Motor CIty Machine Guns, Jay Lethal, Kaz, and Petey Williams they can get out of their slump. The only young guys who are getting their big breaks were Kaz and Samoa Joe. Samoa Joe had to wait 3 years before he could get his break, and Kaz has had to wait 6 years and he still hasn't held world title gold. This is exactly why WWE is still the king.",1214352000,,1537,4.303448275862069

2503173,5,B000E6ULCM,"While TNA is still a second to WWE for me, they do have some highlights to there shows. This dvd is a must for people who love hardcore wrestling. Abyss seems like a Mankind rip off, but still fun to watch. Monsters Ball with Jeff Hardy doing the dive onto Abyss has to be one of the sweetest wrestling moves ive ever seen. The only downside to this dvd is the Dudley Boyz and Rhino VS Jarrett and AMW. They brawled thru out the building and made it hard to follow the action. They also missed out on some amazing points in the match. When Rhino set Jarrett up on a table on the entrace way, I thought it was going be a friggin sweet gore. No dice and that kind of left a sour taste in my mouth. The Sabu VS Abyss barbwire match was ok but wasn't as good as people say it was. TNA has more wrestling then WWE right now, but I still love WWE. This dvd is a must for fans who love hardcore matches. Check it out!",1185753600,,910,3.978142076502732
2503174,5,B000E6ULCM,"tna's collection of their most hardcore matches doesn't dissapoint in the least.  this is one of the best wrestling dvds i've ever seen, as it combines great hardcore wrestling with some nice high-flying and technical wrestling sprinkled in.

1. raven v. abyss v. monty brown (monster's ball) ~ very short match, but otherwise great. abyss gets powerbombed by raven onto the thumbtacks he brought out (abyss always takes the thumbtack spots it seems), and monty brown wins after pouncing raven through a table. (7/10)

2. america's most wanted v. triple x (six sides of steel) ~ this is absolutely my favorite tag team cage match of all time.  all four men bleed, and elix skipper does a sick move, tightrope walking across the top of the cage to perform a hurricanrana onto chris harris.  amw win after doing triple x's finishing move onto skipper while christopher daniels was handcuffed to the cage. (9.5/10)

3. abyss v. jeff hardy (falls count anywhere) ~ a decent match between the two, and it made me remember why i still like jeff hardy.  he does a nice flip off some structure outside the building onto a table-top abyss.  jeff hardy wins, but after the match abyss slams hardy onto some thumbtacks.  i've never seen jeff hardy take a thumbtack spot before. (7.5/10)

4. aj styles v. abyss (six sides of steel) ~ awesome match from the beginning, when styles flips out of the cage door onto abyss.  aj takes a nasty shot from the cage door.  abyss takes out the thumbtacks, but ends up landing in them after aj does a sunset flip powerbomb on him.  aj wins after a sytles clash onto the thumbtacks. (8.5/10)

5. raven v. sean waltman(x-pac) (raven's house of fun) ~ weapons abound including kendo sticks and a staple gun.  waltman surprised me by putting on a nice hardcore match.  some decent table spots during the match.  raven wins after throwing waltman onto a fence that breaks sending waltman out of the ring. (7/10)

6. raven v. abyss (dog collar match) ~ this match proves why these two dominate the dvd.  some sick table spots are involved, and raven even staples a dollar bill to abyss' head.  raven wins by after ddting abyss onto some thumbtacks. (8.5/10)

7. raven and sabu v. jeff jarrett and rhyno ~ not a bad brawl, with raven cutting open jarrett with a pizza cutter at the beginning.  sabu shines as usual, and there were some nice chairshots in the match.  abyss come out and throws sabu through a table, then jeff hardy comes out and takes out abyss.  rhyno and jarrett win after rhyno gores raven through a table as he was about to ddt jarrett.  (6.5/10)

8. sabu v. abyss v. rhyno v. jeff hardy (monster's ball 2) ~ a great match with brawling all over the building, some nice table spots including a swanton by hardy and a gore by rhyno.  rhyno wins afer doing a piledriver onto hardy off the second rope. (8/10)

9. team 3d(dudley boys) and rhyno v. america's most wanted and jeff jarrett ~ the match began with jarrett and amw spreading out to three sides of the arena, setting the stage for a nice brawl.  lots of fighting in the crowd, on the rampways, and elsewhere.  some pretty sick spots including bubba powerbombing one of the amw guys onto the floor.  team 3d and rhyno win, yet i can't remember how at this time. (7.5/10)

10. sabu v. abyss (barbed wire match) ~ this match was too short, but overall it lived up to it's hype.  the ropes were replaced with barbed wire and both men get cut open by the barbed wire (sabu, of course, takes more spots than abyss does).  sabu wins by knocking abyss onto a board of barbed wire, putting another board on top of him, and jumping on top.  again, too short of a match, but a nice way to end the dvd.

Monster's Ball Match

Raven vs. Abyss vs. Monty Brown:

Short but great brawl from TNA's first ever ppv. They fight all over the building and Raven even smashes a trashcan over Abyss' head. They fight back in the ring and knock each other around with chairs. Abyss brings his bag of tacks into the ring but gets thrown onto the pile himself! In the end Monty Brown pounces Raven through a table in the ring and gets the pin. 8/10

Six Sides of Steel Match

America's Most Wanted vs. Triple X:

The very last chapter of this fued met in the greatest steel cage/tag team match of all time. This was a fantastic match and all four men get cut open. The biggest highlight was Elix Skipper giving a hurricanrana to Chris Harris off the top of the cage! AMW wins the match and Triple X has to break up as a team. 11/10

Falls Count Anywhere Match

Abyss vs. Jeff Hardy:

This was a wild brawl that even went outside the building. Jeff Hardy puts Abyss on two tables outside the building and climbs off a steel structure and lands on Abyss through the tables! They fight back in the ring with chairs, ladders and a couple more tables and Jeff Hardy gets the win. 8/10 After the match Abyss throws Hardy onto a pile of tacks.

Six Sides of Steel Cage Match

Abyss vs. AJ Styles:

Great steel cage match. They fight all over the building first and Abyss swings the cage door right in AJ's face. They fight back in the ring and Abyss busts Styles wide open. They continue to fight and Abyss' tacks come into play again. AJ then does a sunset flip off the top of the cage onto Abyss and Abyss lands onto the tacks! AJ wins after giving the Styles Clash to Abyss onto the tacks! 9/10

House of Fun Match

Raven vs. Sean Waltman:

This was a brutal match. A lot of weapons were around and hanging around the ring. They fight all over the place and Raven gets driven through a couple of tables by Sean Waltman. A staple gun, kendo sticks, and trash cans all make appearances. Raven then gives Sean Waltman a back body drop and Waltman lands on a part of steel fencing and falls out of the ring in a great spot! Raven wins the match. 8.5/10

Dog Collar Match

Raven vs. Abyss:

Brutal match between these two. They were attached together by a long steel chain. Weapons included were lots and lots of chairs as Abyss gets thrown into a pile of them after missing a move onto Raven. Raven then staples a dollar bill to Abyss' head! They fight up the ramp and Abyss gets knocked off the stage through a couple of tables that were set up. Raven then gets thrown through two tables by Abyss as they fight back to the ring. At the end of the match Raven DDTs Abyss right onto a pile of thumbtacks and Raven retains his title. 9/10

Raven and Sabu vs. Jeff Jarret and Rhyno:

Great tag team match. Steel chairs were used and Raven even cuts Jarret open with a pizza cutter near the beginning. Sabu uses a lot of high flying moves and a lot of steel chairshots were used. Near the end Abyss shows up and throws Sabu through a table outside the ring! Jeff Hardy shows up and fights Abyss off. Near the end Raven was about to DDT Jarret but Rhyno gored him out of nowhere through a table and got the win. 8.5/10

Monster's Ball Match [2]

Sabu vs. Abyss vs. Rhino vs. Jeff Hardy:

This is one of the best matches on the disk. A fast paced brawl that went all over the building and a lot of weapons were involved. The greatest moment of the match was when Jeff Hardy did a swanton bomb off a tall platform onto Abyss through two tables! A few more table spots were used and in the end Rhino won the match after goring Abyss through a table and giving a piledriver to Jeff Hardy off the second rope and wins the match. 10/10

Rhino and The Dudley Boyz vs. Jeff Jarret and AMW:

This was a wild ECW [the old ECW] feel like match. All six men fought all over the place; on the stairs, on the rampways, in the audience, on the stages, and a lot of weapons were used. Highlights include Jarret throwing Rhino down a flight of stairs, then Bubba Ray powerbombed one of AMW on the floor. Rhino even tried to gore Jarret through a table on the ramp way but Chris Harris superkicked him to stop him. In the end Rhino and The Dudley Boyz get a win. 9/10

Barbed Wire Match

Abyss vs. Sabu:

After months of having No DQ matches and Hardcore Matches, Abyss and Sabu met in their final encounter, a barbed wire match. The ring ropes were replaced by barbed wire, boards wrapped in the wire were set up at ringside, and chairs and baseball bats were wrapped up in them as well. Both men throw each other into the wire and both men get cut up. In the end Abyss lands on a barbed wire board and Sabu puts another board on top of him and jumps onto Abyss to get the win. Brutal match, could have been a little bit longer, but still an excellent match. 10/10

Best of the Bloodiest Brawls Vol. 1 features some of the most hardcore matches TNA has had since they moved to Orlando, FL.  This ""Best Of"" disc is awesome.  Some of the more brutal matches on this disc are:

House of Fun:  Raven vs. Sean Waltman

Six Sides of Steel:  Abyss vs. AJ Styles

Monsters Ball Match: Jeff Hardy/Abyss/Rhino/Sabu

Barbed Wire Massacre:  Sabu vs. Abyss (which is the best match of this collection)

Bloodiest Brawls contains matches from TNA's 1st 3 hour PPV Victory Road to Turning Point 2005.  I rated this ""Best Of"" 5 stars, but would of liked to see some matches from the Asylum in Nashville, TN.  Any fan of wrestling, TNA, ECW, hardcore,Abyss, Sabu, Raven will really enjoy this Volume as Abyss, Raven, and Sabu are frequently featured in many of my favorite matches this volume offers.

Abyss is going to be a hadrcore legend someday and I'm sad TNA lost Sabu to WWE.  Pick this up so you can remember Sabu's time in TNA.  The barbed wire match Abyss and Sabu put on is extreme.  One of the most brutal/hardore matches I've seen to date.  Good job TNA.

Highly recommended.  Sit back and enjoy the best of TNA.  Thanks TNA.

2503210,5,B000E6ULCM,"TNA Bloodiest Brawls is a great way to get hooked on this pro wrestling alternative to WWE. For the past couple of weeks I've been writing reviews trying to persuade wrestling fans to switch to TNA Wrestling.  If you don't believe the hype (I write of) get this DVD. You've got the Barbwire Massacre Match from TNA Turning Point 2005 between Sabu and Abyss...brutal match, unbelievable action!  A sandwich between to pieces of plywood covered in barbwire crushes Abyss and then Sabu leg drops him while in this torturious situation.  Genesis 2005 Main Event Team 3D (formerly the Dudley Boyz) & Rhino take on Jeff Jarrett & America's Most Wanted...so much action in this match that even the cameras can hardly keep up.  Truly a legendary match in the short history of TNA. ""House of Fun"" Match from Hard Justice 2005 between Raven and Sean Waltman (aka X-Pac or Syxx) is GREAT! I was really impressed with this match. On paper, you look at it and say Raven and Sean Waltman, ""ok...should be a decent match"". NO! This Match is awesome I was really impressed by some of the bumps these two took.  Waltman needed to tone down the language a little bit for my taste but still doesn't take away from the brutality of the match.  America's Most Wanted vs. Triple X (Christopher Daniels & Elix Skipper), a legendary match even if you weren't a fan of TNA and just a lame-o WWE Fan.  This match is up there with Mick Foley's drop at King of the Ring (Even though I'm anti-WWE now doesn't mean I can't respect that match for it history making drop).  But no one has even done what Elix ""Prime Time"" Skipper does and I'm not sure anyone will ever try it again.  Skipper's walking of the top of the Steel Cage and then hurri-can-rann of Chris Harris to the mat demands respect from any wrestling fan! This is a must see DVD. You need to buy this today! It's the perfect compilation that will turn you to a TNA Wrestling Fan asking for MORE. I didn't even mention half the matches in detail...but one word describes them all - AWESOME!",1145059200,2,2023,4.505464480874317
2503211,1,B000E6ULCM,"let me tell u what tna is like...its total nonstop action of people talking their heads off on a microphone.  matches are only about 2 minutes long and the same people win EVERY time. you don't even have to watch to find out whats going to happen. even the WWE doesnt talk as much as they do. also, tna is just a trash dump for any WWE star who is fired and still think that they want a wrestling career. no joke. just look at the tna roster.",1144540800,2,442,4.0227272727272725
2503232,4,B000E6ULCM,"This is one of my favorite TNA DVD's as I'm a fan of brawls and they picked a nice selection of matches from their stay in Orlando so far.  The only criticism I have is that I wish some matches were replaced with others as some spots become repeative & lose it's shock value (Jeff Hardy's jumps, Abyss going through the tacks, ect.) and that they would have included some matches from the 2003 Bloodiest Brawls DVD (which is now out of print).

Monster's Ball 1 (Victory Road 2004) ""The Alpha Male"" Monty Brown vs. ""The Monster"" Abyss vs. Raven - Really, this match is just sloppy & all over the place.  Honestly, it's just a spot fest to me.

Six Sides of Steel Cage Match (Turning Point 2004) America's Most Wanted vs. Triple X - Honestly, this was the best tag team match I've seen since Los Guerreros vs. Team Angle in WWE.  Wit the whole ""losers can never team again"" stipulation, you can see these guys went balls out & didn't hold back anything. Elix Skipper's spot towards the end is really something to see.

Full Metal Mayhem (Destination X 2005) ""The Monster"" Abyss vs. ""The Charismatic Enigma"" Jeff Hardy - They went all over the building & outside using tables, ladders, and (of course) thumbtacks.  Like I said, Hardy is great at these weapons matches.
Note: Also available on the Jeff Hardy DVD

Six Sides of Steel Cage Match (Lockdown 2005) ""The Phenomenal"" AJ Styles vs. ""The Monster"" Abyss - This match is just awesome. It's not really a bloody massacre but a great storytelling of ""the big unstoppable monster vs. the little guy who never gives up.""

House Of Fun Match (Hard Justice 2005) Raven vs. Sean Waltman - It was suppost to be Raven vs. Hardy but Jeff no showed so Sean came in last min.  A House Of Fun match just has weapons hanging all around the ring for anyone's use.  This was actually one of the better ones.

Dog Collar Match (No Surrender 2005) ""The Monster"" Abyss vs. Raven - It's not Piper vs. Valentine but it's still good but not as special after seeing both guys in two previous matches.

Tag Team Match (Sacrifice 2005) ""The Homicidal, Genocidal, Suicidal"" Sabu and Raven vs. ""King of the Mountain"" Jeff Jarrett and ""The War Machine"" Rhino - I guess you just had to have a Jeff Jarrett match on this DVD.  This is the typical Jarrett TNA match...they brawl over the area, settle it down in the ring, and have tons outside interference towards the end.  That's was the case here too.  I would have rather seen the Raven vs. Rhino match from Unbreakable here.

Monster's Ball 2 (Bound For Glory 2005) ""The Homicidal, Genocidal, Suicidal"" Sabu vs. ""The Monster"" Abyss vs. ""The Charismatic Enigma"" Jeff Hardy vs. ""The War Machine"" Rhino - This match goes all over the place, weapons galore, and tons of spots.  For me, the best match on this disc.

Six Man War (Genesis 2005) ""The War Machine"" Rhino and Team 3D vs. ""King of the Mountain"" Jeff Jarrett and America's Most Wanted - Not as good as the previous match but just as uncontrolable.  Just like the previous Jarrett match except the brawl on the outside here was just awesome.

Barbed Wire Massacre (Turning Point 2005) ""The Homicidal, Genocidal, Suicidal"" Sabu vs. ""The Monster"" Abyss - This match was just sick as you see moments like Sabu getting dropped on his neck into the barbed wire and Abyss squished inbetween two barbed wire boards.  It's not as distubring as Sabu's last two barbed wire matches (Hardcore Homecoming & vs. Terry Funk) but it still leaves an impression.

The bonus footage was the construction of the Barbed Wire and Abyss' wounds after the match.  Also there's footage of Raven's scalping which was hard to watch as Mitchell held the clippers the wrong way and ended up cutting off parts of Raven's skin.

Overall, one of the better TNA DVD's for me.  Some stuff gets repeative after a while & I would have switched some matches but it's still a nice collection.",1143504000,10,3886,4.587554269175109
2503233,4,B000E6ULCM,"Here's a concept that seems to be lost on most of the TNA/WWE defenders and detractors that frequent Amazon. Instead of squabling over which promotion is better (and really, both promotions have their respective pros and cons)how about (*gasp*) actually reviewing the DVDs for a change. It's a novel idea, but follow me here.

Here is the review for TNA's latest effort ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls Vol 1"". Some fans may be confused as TNA released a ""Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD via their website a couple of years ago. Whereas that DVD featured matches from 2002-2003, this DVD incorporates matches from 2005 and the latter half of 2004.  That being said, let's start the show...

1. ""The Monster"" Abyss v. ""The Alpha Male"" Monty Brown v. Raven: Monster's Ball match from Victory Road 2004.  This is little more than a garbage match with some interesting spots thrown in for good measure. The match flows nicely but is really nothing to write home about. Thumbtacks get involved. Really though, the thumbtack spot seemed cool and innovative a few years back but it is quickly losing it's shock value.  3/5

2. America's Most Wanted v. Triple X: Six Sides Of Steel from Turning Point 2004.  This match has become quite famous among TNA fans for the jaw-dropping acrobatics of Elix Skipper. Hands down, this is probably one of the best cage matches you'll see not only in TNA but in any promotion.  The athletisism, drama, and acrobatics are truly something to behold. ""Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels wears the crimson mask  5/5

3. ""Charismastic Enigma"" Jeff Hardy v. ""The Monster"" Abyss: Full Metal Mayhem from Destination X 2005.  This is an exceptional hardcore/falls count anywhere match that illustrates what a motivated Jeff Hardy is capable of. The match stays relatively un-bloody until the suprise ending. 4/5

4. ""The Phenomenal"" AJ Styles v. ""The Monster"" Abyss: Six Sides of Steel from Lockdown 2005. Much like the AMW/ Triple X classic above, this is a great cage match featuring a bloodied Styles giving it his all against a determined Abyss. This match didn't seem to have the same raw emotion as that aforementioned match, but any true fan worth their weight in water will want to check it out  4/5

5. Raven v. Sean Waltman: House Of Fun from Hard Justice 2005. The former X-Pac and Raven tangle in this gruesome and violent monstrocity that is actually quite good given one of the participants.  This match practically screams ""ECW"" in many ways. When Tenay and West say this match is not for young viewers, that's not just hyperbole! Lots of blood and at least one disturbing spot make this a modern day classic  3.5/5

6. Raven vs. ""The Monster"" Abyss: Dog Collar Match from July 2005.  It's Raven. It's Abyss.  Blood flows.  The match is quite good, but it feels a little redundant considering the screen time both wrestlers have already received on this DVD. Still worth checking out.  3/5

7. Raven & Sabu v. Jeff Jarrett and ""The Man Beast"" Rhino from Sacrifice 2005.  This is actually quite interesting. Like the match listed above, however, it suffers from the nagging sense of redundancy in terms of the hardcore aspect of it all. Still, a great tag team brawl that you just don't seem to see enough of nowadays  4/5

8. Jeff Hardy v. Abyss v. Rhino v. Sabu. Monster's Ball 2 from Bound For Glory 2005:.  Hardcore elitists unite! This wild brawl goes all over the place and features several spots that will make even the most hardened viewer cringe. Much better than that first Monster's Ball match 4/5

9. Jeff Jarrett & AMW v. Rhino & Team 3D: Anything Goes from Genesis 2005: That match starts out slow but quickly morphs into another unrestrained chaotic brawl. This match features a great emotional aspect as the former Dudley Boyz look to settle the score with AMW and Rhino looks to get even with Jeff Jarrett. While it isn't a five star match, this match is one of the better ""ECW""-type brawls you will see 3.5/5

10. Sabu v. Abyss: Barbed Wire Massacre from Turning Point 2005. One word: Wow.  While not quite as memorable as the infamous Sabu/Funk barbed wire match from ECW in 1997, this is still a sick, sick, sick match. Sabu and Abyss prove they are either completely dedicated to their craft or are complete sadists. Many disturbing spots such as Sabu getting dropped throat first across the barbed wire. TNA's first barbed wire match is a cult classic and well worth checking out. 4/5

Bonus: ringside footage of the construction of the barbed wire strands around the ring plus handcam footage of Sabu and Abyss in action.  Plus, we get the disturbing footage from 2003 as Raven's head is shaved (and actually scalped) by Father James Mitchell.  Pretty disgusting as you can see the missing skin on Raven's head.

Pros of the DVD: Great collection of matches that will have you on the edge of your seat.  This makes for a great gift for any hardcore wrestling fan. TNA employs actual wrestling over sports entertainment and it pays off well here. Wrestlers here seemed more dedicated than do many of their WWE cohorts. The DVED is also very well produced with hot camera angles and a slick presentation.

Cons of the DVD: What TNA makes up for in wrestling, they lack in storylines. The matches are great, yes, but the characters don't feel as well-rounded as those in the WWE. This can make it difficult for some viewers to truly get into the matches as they lack the ""mass appeal"" of WWE. Also, this outing borrows heavily from previously released DVDs. Most of these matches can be found elsewhere and don't truly feel unique in that sense. It would have been nice if TNA had dug a little bit deeper in their vault and produced some material from their first ""Best of Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD, but that is really picking nits.

While not quite as good as the ""Best of The X Division"" for instance, this DVD is still a must for TNA fans.  WWE fans may also be enticed to pick it up as it doesn't concentrate too much on technical wrestling (a common gripe among WWE proponents)and rather brings back memories of ECW in its prime.

Almost every match features an ECW original and shows that TNA knows how to book a Hardcore match better than the current owners of the ECW name.",1356652800,,372,4.651515151515151
8106827,4,B000E6ULCM,"This is actually the second ""Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD released by TNA as they put on out in 2003 with matches from their first year. This set is quite good as it covers matches from Nov. 2004-Dec. 2005 and has Mike Tenay and Don West occasionally talking about what made these matches great and brutal.

-Victory Road, Monster's Ball I, Raven vs. Monty Brown vs. Abyss: The build-up to this match made it seem like these guys would be gushing buckets of blood but honestly it wasn't as brutal as it was hyped to be. Not to say it wasn't hard hitting as these three used the weapons well, like trash cans, tables, tacks, chairs and others, it went into the crowd and all over ringside. It does have some good spots like when Brown picks up Abyss in a huge powerslam, later Abyss gets powerbombed onto some tacks and Raven gets the Pounce through a table and Monty covers to win. 7/10.

-Turning Point, Six Sides of Steel Match, Triple X vs. America's Most Wanted: These two teams had an intense rivalry that built to this match where the losing team would split up, all four guys bleed a good amount, there's tons of close nearfalls and high impact moves, with plenty of good tag team wrestling mixed in. The most memorable spot was Elix Skipper walking the top of the cage and giving a hurricarana that has to be seen to be believed. Soon after though AMW hits Skipper with the Powerplex and covers him to win. 10/10.

-Destination X, Full Metal Mayhem Match, Abyss vs. Jeff Hardy: After their spotty but lackluster match the previous month, we have this good contest where it really goes all over the arena, even into the back where Hardy hits a Swanton from some steel girders onto Abyss. Back in the ring Hardy hits a huge leg drop jumping over a ladder but only two, Abyss hits a couple of moves including a huge powerbomb from the second rope through a table, but he falls victim to the Twist of Fate on a ladder and Hardy covers to win. 7/10. Abyss does attack Jeff even hitting the Black Hole Slam into the thumbtacks.

-Lockdown, Six Sides of Steel Match, Abyss vs. AJ Styles: These two always had at the very least good matches and this was one of their better ones as it was a brawl outside the cage, with Styles hitting a huge dive through the door to start it out. Abyss does send the cage door into AJ's face and he works Styles over, but AJ doesn't quit and even hits a sick flip powerbomb sending Abyss crashing through some thumbtacks then covers to win. 9/10.

-Hard Justice, House of Fun Match, Raven vs. Sean Waltman: Stop me when you've heard this before, Jeff Hardy no shows an event, so Waltman steps in and this actually turned out to be a hard hitting match even if these two had no build-up beforehand. Weapons get used like a staple gun, hand cuffs, trash cans and others as both take some hard shots, Raven does end up sending Waltman into some fencing, he falls to the outside and Raven covers to win. 8/10.

-No Surrender, Dog Collar Match for the NWA Heavyweight Championship, Raven (Champion) vs. Abyss: This was a pretty brutal one as both men were linked together with collars and a chain, which got used as a weapon at times. There's plenty of hard shots from both guys and Raven ends up hitting the Raven Effect DDT into a pile of tacks and covers to retain his title. 9/10.

-Sacrifice, Raven & Sabu vs. Jeff Jarrett & Rhino, If Jarrett pins Raven he gets a title shot at the next PPV, if Jarrett is pinned by Raven he doesn't get a shot for one year: Despite that stipulation hanging over the match, this was a pretty good bout, with good tag team wrestling and the beginning of an eventual feud between Jeff and Rhino, mainly due to the finish which saw Rhino hit a Gore out of nowhere and cover Raven to get the title shot. 7/10.

-Bound For Glory, Monster's Ball 2 Match, Sabu vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Rhino vs. Abyss: Way, way better than the first Monster's Ball at Victory Road last year as this went all over the place with tons of high impact spots. Lots of weapon usage with chairs, tacks, tables and others, Sabu hits his trademark dives using the chair to spring off the ropes, the best spot however was Jeff hitting a massive Swanton off the staging on Abyss through a table. A few minutes after this Rhino ends up hitting the Rhino Driver on Jeff off the second rope and covers to win this match. 9/10.

-Genesis, Six Man Revenge Match: Jeff Jarrett & America's Most Wanted vs. Rhino & Team 3D: Great brawl by all six men, very much like the old ECW and a lot closer than anything WWE has tried to do with WWECW. The match starts out in the crowd and stays there for a few minutes and there's plenty of hardcore action from all six men.  The brawling continues and eventually the match gets back into the ring. The table comes into play, but AMW stops it from being used on several occasions. The finish comes when Team 3D hits the 3D on Storm for the win. 10/10.

-Turning Point, Barbwire Massacre, Abyss vs. Sabu: While not as great as Terry Funk vs. Sabu in ECW, this is pretty close as these guys landed and took some brutal hits in the wire mesh. Even barbwire boards are brought out which have disasterous results for each guy, the match is just one bloody bout where Sabu ends up sandwiching Abyss between two barbwire boards and covers to win. 10/10 for the effort.

-Bonus feature is the end of the Hair vs. Hair match between Raven and Shane Douglas where the bloody scalping done to Raven was pretty nasty to say the least.

This was a set that featured some of TNA's best hard hitting bouts, reminds me of why I was a fan of TNA from early on and this is one DVD to pick up for a good price as most all the matches are Grade A quality.",1354492800,,5688,4.349670122525919
8106828,5,B000E6ULCM,"Before Hulk Hogan, Eric Bischoff and a load of former WWE, WCW and ECW stars kept invading TNA, they were pretty much homegrown stars with a few veterans from those organizations to round it out. Also, every match takes place in the original six sided ring! This is what set TNA apart from WWE and everyone else and taking this away when Hogan showed up was a HUGE MISTAKE in my opinion but I digress.

For those that remember how TNA was before this, this is a good memory lane trip. For those that only know TNA as it is today, I DOUBLY RECOMMEND THIS PIECE! Let's take a look:

Abyss Vs. ""The Alpha Male"" Monty Brown (Marcus Corvon of WWECW) Vs. Raven (Monster's Ball Match) - Not that great to start off but isn't the worst match on here either. In fact, to be honest, no match on this DVD is lower than 3 stars.

It isn't all that bloody as only Raven juices in this one. It does show some impressive strength from Monty Brown as he scoops up the 350lb. Abyss with relative ease and little aid from him! Ends when Brown does his ""Pounce"" move on Raven through a table for the victory! Not a great match but not a bad start to this DVD. It does get better though.

America's Most Wanted (James Storm/Chris Harris) Vs. Triple X (Christopher Daniels/Elix Skipper)(Six Sides Of Steel/Losers must disband) - This cage match is legendary in TNA lore! No words I can use will adequetely describe this one. There are a few MUST VIEWS on this release and this is at the top of the list! You must see this one!

Jeff Hardy Vs. Abyss (Full Metal Mayhem/Falls Count Anywhere) - This wasn't the most brutal match Hardy has ever been in BUT it had its moments. After battling all over the place, it ends when Hardy counters a chokeslam into his ""Twist Of Fate"" version of the Ace Crusher onto a ladder for the pin. Ironically, however, it would be Hardy that would take the nastiest move of the match as Abyss used his ""Black Hole Slam"" to put him into thumbtacks! Ugh!

""The Phenomenal"" A.J. Styles Vs. Abyss (Six Sides Of Steel #1 Contender's Match) - Another MUST VIEW in this one! This was an example of TNA booking going right as this was booked as an unstoppable monster Vs. the underdog that could! Needless to say the majority of the crowd was behind A.J. in this one. I won't give away the actual finish but it is awesome! When A.J. won, you could feel the emotion for him from the crowd! Particularly a shot of this young, dark haired woman who was holding back tears at his win! That's emotion you can't script folks and I wish the guys running TNA now would realize that!

Anyway, this one is MUST VIEW as I said earlier.

Raven Vs. Sean Waltman (X-Pac)(House Of Fun Match) - This was pretty much a Raven creation and I pretty much expected him to dominate so I was surprised that Waltman held his own during this. Both men bled during this one! Ends when Raven backdrops Waltman into a fence and falls about 8 feet with it to the floor! Raven takes this one. Pretty good bout.

Raven Vs. Abyss (Dog Collar Match for the NWA World Title) - While this is no Greg Valentine Vs. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, it isn't bad for what it is either! Raven uses every trick in the book during this one while Abyss uses his sadistic trappings along with his brute force. It ends when Raven does his ""Raven Effect"" DDT into thumbtacks for the victory! Both men shared that bump on that one as well as Abyss having a $10 bill stapled into his forehead! Ahhh! MUST VIEW material.

Raven & Sabu Vs. Rhino & Jeff Jarrett - A wild tag team affair which saw Raven (I recall) bleed. Not really bloody but definitely brutal. A stipulation going into the match was that if Jarrett was pinned by Raven, he wouldn't get another NWA title shot for one year but if Jarrett pinned Raven, he would get the next title shot at the next PPV. Ends when RHINO gets the pin on Raven, leading to friction between Jarrett and Rhino that plays out later in this DVD release.

Jeff Hardy Vs. Abyss Vs. Rhino Vs. Sabu (Monster's Ball Match) - I won't even try to describe this one! It was wild action all over the place! This is what TNA used to be about! Ends when Rhino executes a piledriver on Jeff Hardy.....FROM THE MIDDLE ROPE! Definite match finisher! I would rate this as a MUST VIEW!

Rhino & Team 3D Vs. Jeff Jarrett & America's Most Wanted w/Gail Kim (Anything Goes Match) - This one wasn't that bloody as most of the blood was spilled by AMW. This one was another one that was wild action all over the place! Team 3D had just arrived from WWE so they were definitely out to make a name for themselves. All the men involved gave great effort in this. I wouldn't rate this as a M.V. but it isn't a waste of time either.

Sabu Vs. Abyss (Barbed Wire Match) - While this is no Sabu Vs. Terry Funk from ECW, this was no less violent as both men bled in this one! Some sick spots here as both men gave their bodies up to the barbed wire! Ends when Sabu manages to sandwich Abyss between two particle boards covered in barbwire! Ugh! If you can stand the gore, this one is a MUST VIEW!

One bonus feature is the ending of a Hair Vs. Hair match between Shane Douglas Vs. Raven. Raven lost but the hair cutting was one of the grossest things I've ever seen!

Overall, a good release and (as I said earlier) this is when TNA was the bomb! I wished they could get back to that! Anyway, not a waste of money!",1303171200,,5365,4.287549407114624
