510517,3,6302787025,"A slightly daffy cinematic item of little importance, LOVE ON THE RUN has clever direction, sophisticated dialogue, novel settings and ludicrous situations.  The movie is screen entertainment which is easy to take; just relax and have a good time with it!  The plot is a bit improbable, but this is another fast, suave, sophisticated comedy about and heiress and a star reporter.  Joan Crawford is amusing as spoiled Sally Parker while Gable does well in his role of Michael Anthony. This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which stars Joan as a rich American heiress and Gable and Tone (Crawford's real-life husband at the time) as journalists stationed in Europe. Gable and Tone are assigned to cover an international aviator, who turns out to be an evil spy, as well as the upcoming wedding of flighty Crawford...A wild and farfetched plot is helped greatly by the star performances; you can see how hard everyone is working to make this a slick, sexy hit.",947635200,,956,4.888888888888889
510565,3,6302787025,"Screened because of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Director-W-S-Van-Dyke/dp/B0009GX1C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Director W.S. Van Dyke</a>&nbsp;and of course Gable. Have never been a fan of Joan Crawford. In my defense, my intense dislike of her as a performer was set long before any Mommie Dearest baggage.

The summary premise of 'Run' was just too enticing to ignore. And fortunately, the rental fee was worth a nominal bet, as this decently fun movie paid off solid dividends. Nothing amazing, but decent. Particularly when co-star Franchot Tone and Clark are on screen working hard to double-cross one another. More the latter than the former.

And Gable - he's the man - period. This is the guy that every modern clever wisecracking no-nonsense hero has been modeled after, from Indiana Jones to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-McClane/dp/B000VNMMQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John McClane</a>. And it's his performance alone that made the time and funds spent worthwhile.

Opens as wealthy American heiress Sally Parker decides that she doesn't want to become the 'salvation bride' to a destitute European royal and his equally broke family. Ironically, this coming on the heels of my recent inclusion as a fan of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B007712XAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>'.

Gable plays ace reporter Mike Anthony as he accidentally bumps his way into a hot story. Sally needs help to escape her would-be bridegroom, and recognizing the opportunity, he volunteers to be her ticket out. Hilariously,  out-scooping his best buddy and fellow reporter Barney Pells, again.

Speaking of whom, Barney smells a rat when he runs into Mike at the same hotel where the 'good' story is to be found. Understandably suspicious, since his friend lost out during the coin toss thus obliging him to take the 'lousy' story - that of a young American heiress marrying a European noble. So why isn't he at the wedding? Sensing his friend is once again holding out, he shadows the man's every move. Despite this awareness and well-founded suspicions, he once again gets caught off guard and ends up tied-up, bound, and locked in closet. As Barney escapes, he pledges to track the pair down and get revenge.

What no one knows is that Mike and Sally have stumbled into a much bigger story than that of a runaway society bride. In the course of surreptitiously snatching a plane owned by a publicized global adventurer and his wife - the mismatched pair discover stolen secret military plans, In a clever ruse to avoid the press, they inadvertently boosted the transport from a bunch of spies! And like Barney, the nogoodniks are now on the hunt for them, but for completely different and more deadly reasons.

Truthfully, this is the only production that I can say where I found Crawford in anything that could remotely be considered entertaining - and only barely so. Her insincere comedic overacting wears down even the heartiest of constitutions. Not surprisingly, her dramatic efforts are quite the opposite, you could see the talent. When her character is captured by one of the spies, she has to pretend to be a bored cold-blooded opportunist. Unsurprisingly, that scene played very real. Joan was damn good when she was in her cutthroat element. One can see the incredible drive that made her a success, even if it came at being completely insufferable as a person.

Obviously, 'Love On The Run' was capitalizing on the blockbuster success of Clark's earlier movie ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Happened-One-Night/dp/B000022TSL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Happened One Night</a>"" filmed two years previous. And had the producers picked a more suitable actress, this could've been something really special. As it was, the enjoyable gags between the two buddies made it tolerable.

Personal Note: I was struck by how immensely enjoyable Gable and Tone were on-screen and realized where I had seen a similar hilarious dynamic of one smart guy constantly out-manuevering his lesser counterpart. It came in the form of Robert DeNiro and John Ashton in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Run/dp/B00008O38F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Run</a>'.

510566,3,6302787025,"""Love on the Run"" (1936) is probably best known as the film in which Joan Crawford plays opposite her husband (Franchot Tone) and her long time lover (Clark Gable), and as one of the last successful films Crawford made at MGM. This was the 7th pairing of Gable and Crawford, in which a reporter (Gable) helps a runaway bride (Crawford) and together they stumble into the thicket of espionage.

Clark Gable (1901-60) was one of the biggest stars of the 20th century, and a pretty good actor to boot. We remember him best as Rhett Butler for ""GWTW"" (1939), for which he received one of his three Oscar nominations (the other was for 1935's ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and he won in 1934 for ""It Happened One Night""), but he gave us many memorable performances in films like ""Teachers' Pet"" (1958) and ""But Not for Me"" (1959) both of which earned him Golden Globe nominations. My favorite Gable flick is ""Run Silent Run Deep"" (1958).

In 1936 we see Gable at his peak. From 1932 to 1942 he was in the top 10 box office every year except 1 (1938), and sometimes he had 2 films in the top 10.

Joan Crawford (1905-77) plays a runaway bride. At the time of this film, Crawford was MGM's biggest female star. Her marriage to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (1929) and then Franchot Tone (1935) and her success with films like ""Possessed"" (1931), ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), ""Dancing Lady"" (1933), and ""The Women"" put her at the top. Despite her achievements to date, her best years were ahead, with two Oscar nominations (""Possessed"" in 1948 and ""Sudden Fear"" in 1953) and one win (""Mildred Pierce"") in 1946.

Franchot Tone (1905-68) was a marvelous actor who is best known for his Oscar nominated performance in ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935). He made nearly 100 films and gave outstanding performances in films like ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), ""The Man on the Eiffel Tower"" (1949), and ""Advise & Consent"" (1962)."" (1935), and ""Suzy"" (1936). Tone plays a rival newspaper reporter.

FWIW - Tone had considerable box office clout too, appearing in such big hits as ""Bombshell"" (1933), ""Dancing Lady"" (1933), ""Dangerous"" (1935), ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), and ""Suzy"" (1936).

Reginald Owen (1887-1972) is best known as Ebenezer Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) and made nearly 100 films including ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971). Owen plays an aviator.

William Demarest (1892-1983) is best known as Uncle Charley in ""My Three Sons"" (1965-92), but in fact he made more than 100 films including an Oscar nomination for ""The Al Jolson Story"" (1946). He has a brief appearance as Gable's editor.

Woody van Dyke (1889-1943) directs. He is best known for his ""Thin Man"" films, for which he received an Oscar nomination in 1935. He also received a nomination for ""San Francisco"" (1936) and directed Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald in 6 of their films. Van Dyke enjoyed exotic locations and made such films as ""Heart of the Yukon"" (1927), ""White Shadows in the South Seas"" (1928), ""Eskimo"" (1933), ""Northwest Passage"" (1940) and ""Cairo"" (1942).

In 1936 Jean Harlow had 3 films in the top 20 - ""Libeled Lady"" (Spencer Tracy, William Powell, and Myrna Loy), ""Wife vs. Secretary"" (Gable and Loy),  and ""Suzy"" (Cary Grant). The other big money winners were ""San Francisco"" (Gable), ""The Great Ziegfeld"" (Powell and Loy), ""Modern Times"" (Chaplin), and ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" (Flynn and de Havilland). The big Oscar winner was ""The Great Ziegfeld"" (Picture, Best Actress). Other notable films from that year were ""The Petrified Forest"" (Bogart), ""Romeo and Juliette"" (Shearer and Howard), ""Dodsworth"" (Walter Huston) and Fritz Lang's ""Fury"".

The NY Times called it ""slightly daffy"" and noted that ""it has borrowed liberally here and there of tried and true devices and situations"". The Herald Tribune was a little more positive - ""A lot of gay nonsense has been strung together....a fantastic and insubstantial narrative, with the result that it is almost continuously amusing and frequently hilarious.""

Bottom line - this is a fast paced romantic comedy with 3 of the biggest MGM stars of the 30s but it all sounds so familiar.",1314489600,,4144,4.912732474964234
510567,4,6302787025,"""Love on the Run"" really says it all. The entire movie is based on a guise of suspicion and staying ahead of the others, and if anyone knows, it's Joan, how to stay ahead of everyone else. ""I'm a rather unorthodox American as you notice,"" Joan's character Sally says in the picture. And that's really true.

On her wedding day Sally jilts her bridegroom, fleeing out of a window. But don't feel too much pity for her groom, you see he was just a fortune-seeker, going after socialite Sally Parker for her money and her social status.

Sally has to contend with 2 newspaper boys who're following her every move (Clark Gable plays Mike Anthony and Joan's real-life hubby Franchot Tone plays Barney Pells.) Along their journey (through 2 continents and multiple cities) they steal a plane and have to fight the rascally Baron and Baroness.

But even after Sally finds out that Mike is a reporter after a hot story she still loves him, saying to him, ""oh darling don't think, just hold me nice and close."" Joan was amazing as the perpetual victim who becomes the victor. Everyone is after her and everyone wants a piece of her but no one wants anything tangible from her, until she meets and realizes a connection with Mike.

Clark Gable played his part astutely as he always does because it was more like watching a documentary of some sorts than a film because he was so real and believable as he delivered his lines. Francot Tone is a very underrated movie actor of the '30s. Perhaps overshadowed by his wife's own successes. But he was always funny and there was somewhat of an innocence to him that almost always went unnoticed.

The film includes many fun and funny scenes and dialog that is always subtle and not at all in-your-face. I also found some of Joan's getups rather funny. I especially loved the furs, dark glasses and black veil that she wore because she didn't want to ""stand out.""

The movie really says a lot. It's a love story in essence. But it's also a fine melodramatic picture in disguise with lots of twists and turns. You just have to stay with it through the end and you'll get it.",1258675200,4,2106,4.54353562005277

510572,3,6302787025,"W.S. Van Dyke's mild attempt at a screwball comedy should not be confused with the Francois Truffaut film of the same title.

 ""Love on the Run"" as one viewer mentioned has elements of ""It Happened One Night"". I would also like to add to that list ""Roman Holiday"" and another van Dyke comedy ""It's A Wonderful World"" starring Jimmy Stewart and Claudette Colbert (do not confuse this with the Frank Capra film ""It's A Wonderful Life"").

 Gable, once again plays the role of a reporter who catches onto the story of his life when Sally Parker (Joan Crawford) becomes a runaway bride! Parker has decided that her soon-to-be husband was only interested in her money. But, what Sally doesn't know is that Gable is actually a reporter sent to do a story on her wedding. Gable helps Sally escape and the two go into hiding.

 That is just about enough information for you to figure out where the film goes from there. Especially if you've seen the films I mentioned ealier.

 ""Love on the Run"" has a very good beginning and around the middle lost me. I'll give you a hint: Gable prentends to be King Louis XIV.

 Van Dyke, whom by no means do I consider one of the great directors, does a good job of dealing with what he has. Gable and Crawford have good chemistry going, the two had already appeared together, ""Dancing Lady"" is an example. And there are some funny moments especially the character of the caretaker, Donald Meek, and I didn't even mind the somewhat confusing plot going on with Reginald Owen as Baron Otto Spandermann.

 What ""Love on the Run"" lacks is some better writing. The comedy could have been better and the romance scenes even more so. Here we have Clark Gable, the sex symbol of the day, and many of the love scenes are flat. The two have one good scene which actually reveals a lot for its time.

 If your a Gable or Crawford fan ""Love on the Run"" should be able to please you. If you enjoy classic hollywood films you too will get a kick out of this, but, you have to admit, we've seen this done before, and in some cases better.

 Bottom-line: Worthwhile Gable and Crawford vehicle that displays their chemistry. Some funny moments (though not enough) and one good love scene (again not enough) make the film what it is.",1100217600,,2244,4.503703703703704
510573,3,6302787025,"For those of you who thought ""It Happened One Night"" needed a major sub-plot involving spies, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer offers up the 1936 film ""Love on the Run.""  Once again Clark Gable is a newspaper reporter, Michael Anthony, who is sent to cover the wedding of Sally Parker (Joan Crawford), a beautiful American heiress living abroad, to Prince Igor of Taluska (Ivan Lebedeff).  But the bride leaves the groom at the altar and hides out in her hotel suite.  Michael offers to get her out of hotel unnoticed.  Meanwhile, Barney Pells (Franchot Tone), is interviewing Baron (Reginald Owen) and Baroness (Mona Barrie) Spandermann, the distinguished flying pair.  So Michael steals their flying suits and in disguise they go to the airport, wave to the cheering crowd, and take off.  However, Sally discovers detailed plans of a British fortification in the bouqet of flowers somebody gave her before she boarded the plane.  This means that the Baron is a spy and that Michael and Sally are now being pursued through France by people a lot more dangerous than bothersome society reporters.
""Love on the Run"" is the seventh of eight films that Gable and Crawford made together, only the first of which did not feature they as the leading couple.  The whole spy business is played essentially for laughs (remember, this is 1936 and devious Barons with Germanic sounding names are not yet associated with the evils of Nazism), but things do get a bit silly: the tired couple break into Fountainebleau Place to hide out and an old caretaker thnks they are the ghosts of Louis XIV and Mme. de Maintenon.  Still, no one is inclined to think of Clark Gable and Joan Crawford as a classic comedy couple, especially with her running around in those costumes by Adrian.  ""Love on the Run"" only runs 81-minutes long and is an enjoyable but minor offering from the two stars.  I just have to admit that the chemistry between Gable and Crawford always struck me as odd, because I just always thought there was too much steel in Joan for Clark's taste, but obviously MGM thought otherwise.  .",1045958400,4,2072,4.822033898305085

7831081,5,6302787025,"Joan Crawford and producer Joseph Mankiewicz snapped out of the solemnity of the movie ""Gorgeous Hussey"" for this movie where she is back in the arms of Clark Gable again.  Mike Anthony (Gable) and Barny Pells (Franchot Tone) are both friends and fellow press reporters who are in love with the same woman, Sally Parker (Crawford). Both are on her heels in one long chase where Mike, as expected wins over Sally. There is considerable action and popular gagging, but overall entertaining. Gable, as usual outwitting the slower-moving competitor, promises to fill the void in the life of the abused heiress, Sally Parker. She has just deserted a fortune-seeker at the altar, and the two newspapermen see the opportunities in making a series of reports exposing the rich lady's reactions to real romance. Reginald Owen is ingratiating as the suave spy chief and his wife Mona Barrie makes a nice assistant. Donald Meek strains hard to make a nitwit caretaker part humorous.

This is a romantic comedy and W.S. Van Dyke has directed the movie with true professionalism. Reginald Owen and Mona Barrie in the supporting roles helped the lead characters make this movie a box office success. Joan Crawford went on to make eight movies for Mankiewicz that included; The Bride Wore Red; the Gorgeous Hussy; Mannequin; Reunion in France; the Shining Hour; Strange Cargo and Love on the Run.
