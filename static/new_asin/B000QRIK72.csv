This is one of the traditional stories for Westerns, a range war between cattlemen and sheepmen. The variation is the man who owns the water rights but divides it between the competing interests. The complication is Barrow, who is in cahoots with gang leader Trigger Gargan. Capital costs for raising sheep is less than for cattle. Sheep produce wool, a renewable resource cattle produce hides only once. Sheep crop the grass close to the ground, cattle cannot graze where sheep are pastured.",1510272000,,2708,4.431726907630522

I've been trying to watch Tex Ritter's early films in roughly chronological order, and I have to say 1938's Rollin' Plains is the best Tex Ritter film I've seen so far. It may still be in the same general mold as his earlier B-westerns, but there is enough variety here to make it stand out from the crowd. The video and audio quality is quite good, making Tex's singing even more enjoyable than usual. Most importantly, the plot has legs enough to stand on its own, quite comfortably.

Tex Lawrence (Ritter) and his fellow Texas Rangers Ananias (Horace Murphy) and Pee Wee (the much-mustachioed Snub Pollard) are headed to Powder Flats, where a local war rages between the cattlemen and sheepmen. The good guys arrive in the aftermath of a major gun battle, making the place look like a ghost town. This leads to some classic comedy in the form of Ananias and Pee Wee exploring the dark, spooky hotel. Tex is all business, though, and he has his work cut out for him when the sheepmen frame John ""Gospel"" Moody for murder. Gospel owns the land at the center of the whole dispute, and it's up to Tex to clear Gospel's name before the townspeople hang an innocent man and those dirty, rotten sheepmen take his land. Tex ends up using a little psychological warfare this time around, with the help of a cooperative ""ghost."" You still have a big horse chase across the plains at the very end, but even this ends differently than your standard Tex Ritter B-western.

The film looks great, and the audio quality allows Tex's singing voice to come through loud and clear. Throw in a good, solid plot, some effective comedy bits, and a lovely lady (Harriet Bennet), and you've got one impressive Tex Ritter classic.",1128124800,2,1829,4.607361963190184
