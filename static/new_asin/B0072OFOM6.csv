5051872,5,B0072OFOM6,"I do agree with one of the reviews. Andy did a way better job as spartacus, but I do like the new season so far, because now I can focus on other characters that I neglected because of andys awesome acting skills haha He will be missed though :/ I don't like that some of the actors had been changed",1329350400,11,299,4.0
5051873,3,B0072OFOM6,"So....Im really not feeling this new guy Liam.  I honestly haven't gotten into this season at all.  And I love Spartacus, was hooked from the beginning(Ive got many collectibles, from autographs to trading cards and tote bags,lol.  However this new season is just ehhh.  Not feeling it.  I couldn't even finish watching the 1st or second episode.  The actor from what I can see is no wheres near the physical shape Andy Whitfield was in.  Hes taller and just kinda ackwardish really.  He also doesnt seem masculine enough for the role.  He seems very weak compared to Andy and doesnt seem to take charge as well.  But this is just my opinion.  I just don't think I can get into this new season.  I saw about 1/2 of the first episode, part of the second and all of the 3rd and he just doesnt seem to be leader like in this one.  I don't know.......Just my thoughts....Wish they could have found a better actor in my opinion.  They could have put more effort into the story too.  They totally rushed into finding a new actor....Let me  know if any of you has similar thought to mine...",1329091200,20,1083,4.448979591836735
5051874,4,B0072OFOM6,"Blood and Sand was season 1
Gods of the Arena was the 6 episode prequel to Blood and Sand
Vengeance is season 2.

They decided to make Gods of the Arena to give Andy time for his cancer treatments. In all honesty, Vengeance just doesn't feel the same. I can see why they had to get Liam, since Andy died, but they replaced Lesley-Ann Brandt (Naevia) and it just isn't the same.

Trying to give Liam a chance so we'll see... not liking the new Naevia. But it's only up to the 3rd episode right now so I'm hopeful....",1328918400,57,515,4.191919191919192
5051875,5,B0072OFOM6,"Depends on how you look at it. Gods was really Season 0.5 and set before Blood and Sand. So although it was memories of a life in the dyeing seconds of Blood and Sand, it was also the prologue.",1328659200,11,193,3.9743589743589745

5051880,5,B0072OFOM6,"The tragic and untimely passing of Spartacus star Andy Whitfield at the end of the first season created a hole that could not be truly filled, as his performance in the first season provided an emotional anchor around which the whole story revolved.  This is not to diminish the performance of  his subsequent replacement, actor Liam McIntyre, who was certainly well-cast and the series is still worth following and finishing.",1506211200,,426,5.071428571428571

5051902,5,B0072OFOM6,"This is the most amazing TV series I have ever seen. The action is non stop, the female actors are fantastically beautiful, the male actors are magnificent physical specimens and the sets, plot and acting are first rate.

CAUTION: If you are squeamish about extreme violence, splattering or squirting blood or explicit full frontal male and female nudity, frequent humping, then you should avoid this show. For me, those features were indispensable to the success of the show.

My only complaint is that penises are shown fully exposed but vaginas are covered by thick bush. Perhaps Brazilian waxing had not been discovered in that era, but I'm sure that bush trimming was commonplace. There is a movement to free the penis, but someone needs to work on freeing the vagina also.

My only real regret is that the series ended after season 4. I am currently midway through season 4 and will be lost when it ends. I'm not sure if any new program can even equal Spartacus much less replace it.

If you like Gladiator movies, you will quickly become addicted to this series, guaranteed.",1485820800,,1081,4.795698924731183

5051935,5,B0072OFOM6,The second season of Spartacus is just as good as the first one. Liam McIntyre does an admirable job in the titular role after the untimely demise of Andy Whitfield whose portrayal of Spartacus was excellent. As the second season begins Spartacus and his band of former gladiators and slaves is on the run from Roman troops led by Praetor Glaber. The action is stylized and the intrigues abound in this worthy continuation of the Spartacus story.,1468454400,,446,4.805194805194805

5051937,4,B0072OFOM6,"The second induction of the Spartacus arrived on time and was in great condition.  Season Two continues to follow the gladiators and the aristocrats in ancient Greece.  This is an entertaining movie, but it is chock full of sexual and violent situations.  It is not made for young eyes.  The story leaves you wanting more.  The costumes and scenery seem as though they are directly from the period of time in which the show is based.  I would recommend to others.

But Spartacus is one I will be watching over and over. Just finished watching the whole thing for the second time. Might be a yearly endeavor.

5052274,5,B0072OFOM6,"Wow, that is a great show.  I was a little skeptical about the show when I first heard they were making this show.  But wow, I was blown away with the story line.  I also did some research about the show being historically correct and yes, it's very close.  And what I mean is the show portrays the Romans and gladiators very close to the real deal.  It's not perfect but from what I read, it's close.  Two things are a little off.  Gladiators did not shave them selves, that is why the Romans called the gladiators beast because there were so hairy.  And, the gladiators did not dies as often as the show portrays.  About 2/3 of the fights were NOT to the death.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, you just have to get past the most T&A of any show every on paid TV!",1419292800,,774,4.168918918918919

5052288,5,B0072OFOM6,"Let me start of this review in stating that I do not understand why Vengeance gets such a bum rap in the reviews. Now maybe because I came onto the Spartacus scene late during a Starz mini-Marathon of Vengeance and that was how I was introduced to series for the first time that is why I feel that way.

At first I was turned off by the amount of gore, to me it seemed gratuitous and not necessary, don't get me started on the sex scenes...did we really need all of them... okay, loved the full frontal of Glaber....

But putting all of that aside, I started watching because of Lucy Lawless, hey big Xena fan, she was my hero growing up and the reality was, I was bored, I had a few hours to kill so why not watch a new series, what would I have lost, a few hours of surfing the net.

I am glad I did sit and watch. Lucretia, Ilithyia and Glaber were captivating. I was drawn into their twisted convoluted world. I was interested in Spartacus and his rebellion, but equally spellbound by the ""Romans"".  Lets not forget Ashur, the deceit, cunning and deviousness, my goodness, the four of these characters were as equally compelling as the ""Rebels""

I don't want to give away any spoilers in case you haven't watched the show or this Season yet, but I tell you, go into it with an open mind. I watched Vengeance, then Blood & Sand followed by Gods of the Arena. Out of the 3, Vengeance is the one that I repeatedly watch the most. Other than War of the Damned it is my favourite season.

I more 'acting' driven than 'actor' driven, so the comparison that Liam was not as good as Andy was lost on me as they both were great at the role they played. They each made the role their own, they each were portrayals of Spartacus at different points in his life. In Blood & Sand he still had hope, was fighting for a cause, his wife, in Vengeance he was lost, he really didn't have that anchor that he had in Blood & Sand to be optimistic and full of fire. When I watched Blood & Sand, I did not compare Andy to Liam, I was enjoying Andy's take on Spartacus, as I watched Vengeance again, I did not compare Liam to Andy as I took it as Liam's portrayal of Spartacus.

If you are look for a semi-realistic adaptation of what may be plausible historical events surrounding Spartacus, then this is for you. If you are looking for complete historical accuracy, then, this is not for you. But if you are looking for an escape and an engaging way to kill a few hours, sit in a comfy chair grab a few snacks and enjoy.",1417478400,,2503,4.2238493723849375

I recommend it to anyone for the truly outstanding writing, talented cast and innovative filming techniques. (*Note that I very much miss Andy Whitfield though Liam McIntyre does an admirable job picking up Andy's mantle!) The twists and turns of the plot are always startling and unexpected and played to perfections by the actors who must have relished their parts in this drama. The commentaries are also very interesting for those interested in going behind the scenes. This is a costume drama that goes far beyond ROME in both characterizations and visual presentation.

5052386,5,B0072OFOM6,"The actor who played Spartacus passed away sadly and was replaced with a new actor who in my opinion is not as strong for this role.  That being said the script is still amazing, the supporting cast, director, set designers, camera techs, sound editors, costume designers, lighting and make up people etc. are all kicking so much butt that it hardly matters. The torch blazes on. This season is filled with more messed up stuff, more hard decisions for the characters and blood everywhere.  The combat is amazing and seems historically accurate to me (like I don't see Kung Fu anywhere and the fighting reminds me or Roman statues of combat).  Everything really feels and looks like how I pictured Rome in that period.  In this season and really the first one too I learned that Lucy Lawless has a far greater range as an actress than I thought.  It was all amazing.

In the first season of Spartacus, Whitfield was very intense and driven to avenge Spartacus' wife and did an excellent job portraying Spartacus. With that said, when I started watching season 2, I had  to stop watching and verify it was Liam McIntyre playing Spartacus because McIntyre and Whitfield had an amazing resemblance and I could tell that Spartacus was different. Initially, I was unimpressed with McIntyre as Spartacus - probably my disappointment that it wasn't Whitfield - but I quickly started to enjoy McIntyre in the role.

Huge blobs of blood that spatter all over the screen, scenes that stop in the midst of action in order to emphasize the details, exaggerated porn etc. Sad and totally unnecessary.

The show is very well acted and storylines kept me interested the whole way through. If you are unfamilair with the series here is a summary of season 2.

Season 3 (Spartacus: Vengeance) is the second or third season depending on how you score them of Spartacus. This season follows Spartacus: Blood and Sand storyline. Spartacus (played by Liam McIntyre, who replaces the late Andy Whitfield), after he and his fellow gladiators kill their master Batiatus and escape from his ludus, or gladiatorial training school.

5052485,5,B0072OFOM6,"Such a GREAT, MUST SEE Show...I didn't even know why they had delayed making another season after Spartacus: Blood and Sand had come out but, it turned out sadly, that production for another season was delayed because the great, and total hottie, lead actor Andy Whitfield was diagnosed with (and sadly passed away from) early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
My heart was truly sad when I heard about his passing and I honestly don't like Liam McIntyre quite as much as I did Andy Whitfield as Spartacus but, the show has a truly great ensemble cast that it doesn't really matter. Plus, Mr. McIntyre is still good, don't get me wrong, just not as good as Andy Whitfield was if you ask me.
Anyhow, this is a show that shouldn't be missed (except by those that it is inappropriate for) because it really is that good and worth getting STARZ for on your cable, sat, or dish just so you can watch it!  If I hadn't gotten STARZ to watch this particular show, I would have never been turned on to other shows they make now like Camelot, The White Queen, Da Vinci's Demons, and Black Sails now.  Bottomline, great freaking show!

5052486,5,B0072OFOM6,"I enjoy historical, time period present, believable, and realistic true interpretations of what could have happened. The research done by the story tellers was not only entertaining but fun to consider different plot angles. Other films enjoyed are Bravehart, The Patriot, K-19, Band of Brothers, and The Gladiator. There are too many films of unworldly powers where the story changes with some new created power. Spartacus was different as I enjoyed the underdog role he played and that he did not get caught up incorruption when he obtained power. James Bond is cool even though some of it is unbelievable. Much appreciated viewing for me!!",1390694400,,642,5.123809523809523

5052490,2,B0072OFOM6,"The Spartacus series reminds me the old ""Dallas"" TV series - just with the overhyped gore and nudity added.  There are all the comparable characters - heroes, villains, victims, vixens, vamps, etc.  And Spartacus' scriptwriters apparently must think they invented the ""f"" and ""c"" words, as they insert them into the dialog with such monotonous frequency.  They're not the first writers to substitute profanity for substance.

""Dallas"" actually had one great advantage:  it knew it was semi-satire and never took itself too seriously, content to remain enjoyable fluff entertainment.  Spartacus tries to take itself seriously as great art and utterly fails at it.  Honestly, I don't see how anyone over the mental age of 18 can like it.",1389484800,,735,5.177966101694915

5052524,3,B0072OFOM6,"Where do I begin? With Blood and Sand, and Gods of the Arena.....I couldn't get enough of Spartacus! It was a non-stop, thrill-a-minute roller coaster ride that kept you coming back. It seemed like every actor chosen was poured into the role. The plot was solid and the actors made it believable!!

Enter ""Spartacus Vengeance"". What can I say? It was a total disappointment! McIntyre is NOT Spartacus! The whole plot becomes a mish-mash of bad acting and nonsensical twists! Most of the new characters were poorly cast. Take for example Spartacus' love interest. The chick was HIGHLY annoying; her poor acting....her forced accent....her rat-like appearance....and the fact that a 90lb woman can suddenly fight and defeat well-trained Roman Soldiers. Worse yet, she takes a few archery lessons and she's a veritable Robin Hood! Yeah, THAT'S believable!! Hell, they didn't even cast the same girl who played ""Nevea"" in the first two seasons...leaving us instead with a lanky, dreadful, big-lipped, acting-school flunky stand-in who does little more than scream and look like a wet dog in every scene! Who were the producers trying to fool??!!!! On top of that....this scared little waif manages to defeat a gladiator and legions of Romans, all with a few weeks of training! What a CROCK!!! And then there's the blond German girl!! Oh yeah...there's another one that apparently can defeat men twice her size and can take punches like a man can, all: a) without bleeding b) never getting knocked out c) beating every man she fights and d) forcing us to believe she's tough! Who in the hell were the producers and casting directors thinking when they cast these three bimbos! Rat-girl and Ghetto-slave truly RUINED the show! You'll see!!

And then there's McIntyre himself! I'm sorry...but anyone who wears that much eyeliner has no business being a gladiator!! His darker voice, heavier accent, forced performance....it ALL played into the demise of this once-great show!!! He gives a forced speech for every little thing, and like clockwork, his followers cheer on cue!  Heed the warnings about what others have written....the other characters now upstage Spartacus himself. They have to! McIntyre was a valiant attempt....but it fell flat early on through this season, and gets worse in War of the Damned! Its only salvation was that Crixus, Anameus, Gannicus, Glaber, Illythia and Lucretia stayed with the show...because they had to carry it! This show and all characters should've been killed off when Whitfield passed away. It was a travesty to see such a great show die at the hands of these terrible additions!

The only reason I gave it three stars is because the CGI is still great. The violence is almost TOO gratuitous, as was the sex! ..Unfortunately neither could save this season!

Save your money! Either borrow it from someone you know or rent it. Better yet, buy both seasons of HBO's ""Rome""!!! It's what Spartacus was patterned after. Either way, save your money....or regretfully, you'll remember my review!!",1381536000,,3024,5.076458752515091

the main character aquired cancer and passed away. My condolences to his family. Spartacus and the characters that follow throuhg in this
series do a great job.
If Gladiators and hand to hand combat is your thing with a tad of love stories this ones very good. It can get a bit racy in
some of the scenes though, so put the kids to bed and condition your thoght pattern a bit becauase it will test your morala a little.

I wasn't so sure of the first season, what with the cheesy CGI and ultra-bloody, slo-mo violence, but the style of this show grows on you and after a while it seems normal and really does seem to take you away to ancient Rome.  I was leery of this season because of the new actor hired to replace Andy Whitfield - I didn't want to have to get to know a new Spartacus as the heart of the show.  While Liam McIntyre doesn't have the same quiet menace of Andy Whitfield as Spartacus, he does resemble him, and just gets better and better in every episode.  I really enjoyed seeing old villains pop up and the return of old characters in new situations.  Vengeance has a good mix of old and new characters and seems to have more coherent writing than previous seasons.  The character development is much better in this season and by the end, I didn't want to say goodbye until the next year.  I haven't watched the special features of the DVD yet.

5052582,2,B0072OFOM6,"I would have to agree with all the bad reviews, this is just not the same as blood and sand and gods of the arena. Too much fake blood n gore too much fake sex, NO story!!! It was nice to see a lot of the characters from the 1st season and G.O.T.A and the new Spartacus is no Andy but he's not bad, in fact I think he was too good for the junky role and never really got to shine, something happen after Andy died that's left me thinking they went with less story more blood and sex trying to attract new viewers thinking the old 1s will stay loyal or wont? IDK it just feels like they changed everything up trying to get fresh viewers and it only disappointed the old 1's.",1372723200,,673,3.9925925925925925

5052585,5,B0072OFOM6,Got a great deal on this and the show is simply fantastic. A friend of mine suggested I check out the series and I was very pleased with the action and pace of the show. There are some really tense moments in alot of episodes and the acting is fantastic. Plus everyone is in fantastic shape and worked hard to be to truly capture the role of Gladiators. Fantastic and a much watch for fans of action and brotherhood type shows.,1372550400,,427,4.283950617283951

5052587,5,B0072OFOM6,"This is an amazing show to get into it. Only has a few seasons, but it is definitely worth watching. Very gory, amazing special effects, so you have to have the stomach for it. I would buy this again!!",1372464000,,201,4.17948717948718

5052590,2,B0072OFOM6,Still a good show but the sear balls and stupidity to recast spartacus to a lesser actor is insulting and irritating ruins the feel of the show,1372377600,,143,4.333333333333333
5052591,3,B0072OFOM6,"There are periods in history that I find captivating and the history of The Roman Empire is just that.

The tale of Spartacus and the slave revolt that shocked roman society is intriguing to say the least.  When Starz announced that they were going to portray the story of Spartacus, I was hooked.

Season 1 was a very gritty presentation of the seedy under belly of the life of a gladiator...I thoroughly enjoyed the season entirely.

That season was then followed by the season that was out of sequence as a prequel, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, still very enjoyable. These two seasons left me with a high level of expectation for the seasons to follow.

With a new actor portraying Spartacus in this season 2 presentation....well...it did continue the telling and theatrical production of Spatacus. But it wasn't as gripping...it wasn't as compelling nor as captivating. It was not as gritty as its predecessors. I found it lacking. It's frustrating when when want so much to enjoy a series and yet there comes a time when you realize it won't be...

It just was not as...

I bought this DVD set because it was part of the story, a piece of the series. Unfortunately,  it sits unopened alongside the prequels that were everything that I enjoyed and appreciated in the series....I wish that this season had been more of what the previous seasons had promised.",1372291200,,1362,4.741525423728813
5052592,5,B0072OFOM6,"I enjoyed this series of Spartacus. Great storyline, great actors, and full of suspense. I am going to hate to see the series come to a close. I purchased the dvd's to add to my video collections. It is so worth it.",1372291200,,215,4.142857142857143

5052595,3,B0072OFOM6,as with the other episodes of Spartacus there were missing segments to complete the story If you haven't seen the original story on STARZ  you will be questioning the story on what is going on with the story another disc to complete the story is needed,1371945600,,252,4.478260869565218

5052597,5,B0072OFOM6,"Im not a writer. And so many people i will not be naming all of them, or all the writers or directors.  Simply put. If you can handle blood, lots of sword fighting, very graphic violence and sex?  Then there is a chance you will love this. That stuff aside, it is about what we all try to enjoy today. Our freedom. Braveheart was the same theme.  Gladiator to a degree the same.  Rome is using people as slaves in gladiator games and hurting and killing them and their families.  Then Spartacus starts a revolution and thousands and thousands of former slaves join his cause. Spartacus had a wife.  The Man in charge of the gladiators killed his wife. it takes him a season to realize it. Then all hell breaks loose and it begins.  Spartacus: Gods of the Arena.  That is a must see.  It is what happened before Spartacus arrived.  The person who was spartacus passed away sadly. Then they had to find the right replacement. while doing so, they made ""Gods of the Arena"".  Spartacus Vengeance is just perfect.  It took a while to get use to the new spartacus.  They do look alike so it is really the way they approach the character that separates the two. I loved this series and i just wish they would have gone on for another season or two. If you don't mind violence and almost soft porn sex, you can enjoy the plot, and sub plots and what sparacus is trying to do for his people. He wants freedom for all. And they fight for it.  I did not do this justice.  But i say give this a try.  But you need to start with the first one, then gods of the arena, then Vengeance, then War of the damned.  Four seasons.  And to me the best of top five best series of all time.  You cant go wrong trying it.  I gave you a very short version. You could write pages on what this is about and what they have done.  Im not that good. But the series is.....",1371686400,,1841,4.188034188034188

5052601,4,B0072OFOM6,"The total production, writing, acting, is well done.  A bit more excessive on the gushing blood scenes then would seem necessary to carry the story forward, but all in all the rest of the movie keeps me coming back for more adventures.",1371254400,,235,4.595238095238095

5052605,2,B0072OFOM6,I didn't really like the stories and what was happing. They killed off some of the actors and actress from the first season in a way that i didn't like. The sex just seemed to be in for not a very good reason. The two gay men were not shown doing very much at all not like the first season. I think they got cold feet and didn't want to go very far. I don't see why they couldn't have gotten someone to play spartacus that had a lot more muscles. I told a friend that I did't think it was worth buying and will not get if for my collection.,1370995200,,540,3.873873873873874
5052606,3,B0072OFOM6,"The nudity and violence are fun to a point. Afterwards the characters just stop being that interesting. Well, the female characters do develop some amount of complexity and you want to watch what happens, but Spartacus is SO one dimensional and uninteresting that it's a huge drag on the series. If I could just skip the whole Spartacus-Crixus parts and watch the politics unfold (with all the fun parties) I would continue watching!",1370908800,,433,4.945205479452055

5052613,3,B0072OFOM6,"... is what makes this watchable. I recommend the first season of this show, but as it goes on, the ""unique speech"" becomes more like caveman-talk, and the ""slow-mo"" becomes exceedingly overdone. It also becomes so much more soap-opera, and the story seems to falter. It is historically bad, but a good action flick for those who like soap-opera action flicks. Craig Parker is really a very good actor, and it is a shame he did not get more screen time in the first, but he does in this one, at least.

5052617,4,B0072OFOM6,I was a little skeptical about this because I so loved Andy in the title role but I think Liam came into his own. And the second season is just as bloody and charged as the first. The emotional connection to the characters is still there as well; perhaps even more so because they go through even tougher situations and you just want them to succeed.,1369526400,2,350,4.318181818181818

The realism of life at that time with all of the ugly, barbarism, cruelty, savagery, and lust of all kinds is not sparred...Bravo to the cast and crew.  One can fully understand why Rome fell pray to the Mongols and hordes of later years. The Romans became totally corrupt and self absorbed.....",1369180800,,440,4.918918918918919

5052658,5,B0072OFOM6,"The only thing negative I can say about Spartacus is it is so suspenseful you will want more than 4 seasons. Watch from the beginning. A lot of foul language, homo scenes. Otherwise it is excellent. I don't know how it is rated but it is not for kids. Ancient Rome took the path that America is going down today. Cant wait to watch season 4.",1366502400,,341,4.181818181818182
5052659,4,B0072OFOM6,"While I don't feel like this season compares to the first season or even the follow up prequel season, I felt it was a successful comeback from a situation that could have been derailing, namely the death in real life of the main character's actor. Coming back from that with a lead worthy enough to play Spartacus helps their cause but the plot doesn't feel as tightly woven as previous seasons. Yes we get some great moments of Vengeance and some major deaths but I felt like they should have held back in some regards in terms of those chosen to die. Regardless, this is a great season of a show which I find is compelling and worthwhile to watch.",1366416000,,650,4.425

5052661,3,B0072OFOM6,"Having recently revisited ""Blood and Sand"" and ""Gods of the Arena"" for the first time since their original run and the finishing of ""War of the Damned""
It is apparent that ""Vengeance"" is the red-headed stepchild of the Spartacus series. I'm sure the untimely death of Andy Whitfield was the primary reason for
this. No offense to Liam McIntyre, but he just wasn't up to Whitfield in acting chops or intensity in the role. To his credit Liam did grow more comfortable
in the role and by the final season had made his own interpretation of Spartacus, not bad, but not up to Whitfield standards. Much worse was Cynthia Addai-Robinson taking over the role of Naevia from Lesley-Ann Brandt. The woman can't act herself out of a paper bag. For two seasons the only emotions she showed
were anger and rage. She made a complex character totally one dimensional. Add in the confusion added by taking what was meant to be a 12 episode season
squeezed into 10 episodes with many story lines dropped or left permanently unresolved and you are left with a season that does the required advancement of
the story, but in a uninspired and barely adequate way. The final season,""War of the Damned"" is a great improvement, with the exception Addai-Robinson, who
still is woefully inadequate in the role of Naevia.",1366416000,,1295,4.76
5052662,4,B0072OFOM6,Although I didn't like Liam McIntyre as much as Andy Whitfield (to me you can tell Liam was trying much harder to talk in a certain way and he seemed more pompous as Spartacus than Andy did).

I have not really noticed the replacement actors, as there was so little for them to do this time around that they didn't have to do any actual acting.  The big problem for me was TOO MUCH blood and gore, TOO MUCH gratuitous sex, and TOO LITTLE plot.  The slo motion and CGI effects made it seem like a comic strip.  The show also has a much cheaper look this time.  Corners are being cut by the look of it.

If the producers want to milk this cow further they need to get back to a story and cut back on the blood lust - it just gets tiresome after a while.  When I get up to make a cup of tea and don't bother to put the episode on pause, I know they are in trouble.",1365897600,6,895,3.9060773480662982

He brought to the performance a certain spark, an intense passion that was conveyed in every expression. Did Liam fill his shoes... not entirely. But did Liam step up to the plate? Yes he did. It was no easy feat to replace Andy, No one really could. I'm not sure if even Brad Pitt could have picked up the sword and taken over the role after Andy. So, I'm willing to give Liam a break. The storyline was amazing and kept me highly engrossed and entertain with each new episode. I'm a huge fan of the way Spartacus is filmed, although, I believe they used the ""phantom camera"" a bit too much. I loved watching the back-stabbing between the Romans as well as the camaraderie between the rebels. One of my favorite aspects was bringing the Champion from the prequel to fight alongside the Champions from the original season.  Great series all around. :D",1364860800,,986,4.447513812154696

I was worried that the actor changes for some of the characters would make the series different in negative ways. Andy Whitfield can never be replaced. However, with that being said, Liam Mclntyre has done a wonderful job. He keeps the character of Spartacus alive. Naevia's actor was also replaced.

  But there are a couple of things I didn't like. First, almost all of the action scenes would go into slow motion for a few seconds, then continue in normal speed, then back into slo-mo again, and again, which was a BIG distraction!
 The second was the new Navia, Crixus' lover. The original Navia was played by Lesley-Ann Brandt, but she was replaced by Cynthia Addai-Robinson, who just is not as pretty as Lesley, and I never could accept her as Navia.
  The original Spartacus, played by Andy Whitfield, who unfortunately died, was replaced by Liam McIntyre, who does an admirable job. No complaints about him once I got used to the new Spartacus..
  Many of your favorites are back - Lucretia, Doctore, Crixus, Mira, Ilithyia, and Ashur. And there are quite a few new characters to get to know.

I watch the show mostly for the intrigue and tactical maneuvering, and less for the fighting and swordsmanship.  So I could do with fewer of the slow-motion, prolonged and highly-choreographed battle scenes.  I could take or leave the gratuitous violence and nudity, but I suppose that these elements are historically accurate and realistic for that era in Roman society.

Still a lot of Cgi action and a lot of sex and violence. Not crazyabout CGI but you get use to it and some of it is done well. Some just look too fake.

5052723,4,B0072OFOM6,"Spartacus good.
Spartacus Strong.
Spartacus on steroids?

That's pretty much it. If you're new to the saga, you might have a problem getting used to the way they speak (no one on earth really talk this way). The best way to describe it is someone thought Shakespearian speech was too difficult (and too boring) but Australian English accent wouldn't cut it either!

So they found something in between.

Despite a few laughs, the show grows on you. There's a lot of gory images and frontal nudity, but hey, it is not TV, it is PORN. If you're a buff guy, proud of your macho-man status, this may not be the show for you, even though the commercials may appear so, with their misleading decapitation, spilled guts and bloody mess images. Most of the guys are naked--all the time. ON YOUR FACE NAKED. So girls, (and some guys) saddle-up!

If you're expecting History, watch HBO's ROME. If you want to be entertained, watch spartacus. The worst that could happen to you could be a overwhelming feeling that you SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD THAT BURRITO for dinner, and you must, immediately, join a gym.

Pointing out once again AMAZON'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE CLOSED CAPTIONS AND VIEWING REWINDING may reduce you ability to fully appreciate this gory, eye-candy, thunder-muscle, series.

5052725,4,B0072OFOM6,"I have to edit this review, because at the time that I wrote it, I didn't know that the original actor that portrayed Spartacus had a terminal illness and couldn't play the role again.

However, I do only give this four stars because I feel the makers could have gotten someone that 'fit' a little more. The actor they got to play Spartacus, is too American. He has the presence and somewhat the look, but not the voice. His voice has the undertone of a different region and that is kind of distracting. He also has the look of an American. The previous actor had a more European look. The same with Navia. The first actress had a look to her as well, the new doesn't have that same look. The first actress had a kind of quiet, submissiveness and delicacy to her. The second one doesn't.

Over all, this is a good show and fans of Spartacus will more than likely enjoy it.",1362787200,,872,4.310975609756097

The fight scenes were awesome, even though some would complain about the over use of blood spatter. I think it makes it more realistic. I have seen too many movies and TV shows that after battle, the heroes or villains come away with clean swords.

I would recommend it to everyone who loves a good epic, but it is definitely not for children.",1362700800,,431,4.671052631578948
5052729,3,B0072OFOM6,"It's sad to say but this third season of Spartacus feels like a compilation of film left on the cutting-room floor.
The actors are fine the set design is fine, but the story has gone off in an uninteresting tangent.  The original Spartacus (season one) felt very claustrophobic, as the gladiators might have felt.  Now that they are free, they seem to be terribly
disorganized with all sorts of dissention among their ranks (if there were ranks, which there isn't).  Since it's difficult for the ex-gladiators to stay even remotely unified and organized, the Romans are able to weaken their ranks almost without effort.

The weakness here is in the writing/script, which is a pity.",1362614400,,681,4.895652173913043

5052742,4,B0072OFOM6,"Having watched HBO's ""Rome"" a few months back, I had to get ""Spartucus"", & its follow-up ""Vengeance"", the production values on this one is awesome, you really feel like you are back there in 70 B.C. watching the action unfold,  this one is more action packed & quite different from the first one, although many feel Liam McIntyre struggled to replace Andy Whitfield, I felt he did the best he could do filling Whitfield's shoes & made the character his own, I didn't have a problem with his performance, as many have pointed out, the arena destruction is awesome & well done, this one revolves around the freed Gladiators fighting & trying to overthrow the Romans, with many action battle sequences, & yes, we get more nudity & sex in various scenes, one thing this one does quite well is show us how brutal the Romans were, whereas in ""HBO's Rome"" we only got a touch of it, where two Roman soldiers were unlikely heroes, here the Romans are anyyhing but, Graig Parker's portrayal of the Roman general Gladus is parallel to Jason Isaacs' brutal British general in Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"", I don't know which is more brutal, like that one he kills anyone who gets in his way or challenges him, Viva Bianca returns as his scheming wife as does Lucy Lawless who parallel Joan Collins & Linda Evans on ""Dynasty"" as they constantly try to out manuever one another, I was disappointed that Mira (Katrina Law) & Spartucus' relationship didn't go anywhere, & Dustin Clare returns from the prequel ""Gods of War"", & is this show's anti-hero who is a loner that plays both sides to his own advantage, all in all this one delivers the goods, however there are some things that really bugged me about this one, the blood & gore scenes are a little overdone as if the filmakers got a little bit carried away with the CGI blood  shots, & did we really need to see a innocent slave girl crusified, an orgy massacre, one by Spartucus & then one by the Romans, or a captured gladiator tortured & skinned alive by some aritocrats at a party function, another pretty girl crusified off camera & the big whopper....a new character (won't spoil it here) gets her throat cut & spills a waterfall of blood( come on, man) , I realize that the filmakers were trying to show us the brutality of the time, but these scenes were overkill in my view, HBO's Rome"" carefully avoided going overboard with scenes like this, why couldn't ""Spartucus""? even the previous season  ""Blood & Sand""  kept it simple, other than these rants, it is a great conclusion & every one of the villians get what they deserve in the end which is quite satisfying, don't know if I will care for the next one ""Village of the Damned"" which features a young Julius Ceaser who looks nothing like Ceaser in ""HBO's Rome"", I know the filmakers don't have honor ""Rome"", but this is the same audience that has watched ""Rome"", it couldn't have hurt, instead ""Spartucus"" Ceaser is a rip off of Brad Pitt's character from ""Troy""..(watch the trailer)....don't know if I will even care about the next one, but ""Blood & Sand"" & Vengeance"" are worth owning & highly recommened & a good companion to HBO's Rome"".",1361836800,,3145,4.600713012477718

The characters and the actors that play them learn and evolve through the season and thankfully do not beomce stagnant.  The writing, costumes, sets and the action scenes are still up there with the first season and got better as Spartacus learned to become a true leader.

5052759,5,B0072OFOM6,"It seems that some people cannot criticize the show w.out reference to the display of penises.  Gentlemen, this is set thousands of years ago.  Life was short and brutal for many and they did not get caught up on the same mores as today. (For example, in the first show Solonius stops in the middle of the street and defacates at a public toilet right next to the man that he'd been conversing with.  If I recall, the attendant wiped his arse for coin!) Also, if you look around, there are more displays of breasts because there's an equal number of leading women and hand maidens. Are you so blind that you cannot see the areola beneath the women's shear dresses?  In sum, wether you favor women or men, there is plenty to enjoy.  And unless you are dimwit, that is what the writers meant to do, in addition to following some historical guidance.  FWIW, I hear that in Roman times the phallus was a powerful symbol.  Even in HBOs 'Rome' households and street walls had statues and graffiti (a word from that period) of penises.  In sum, sort out your facts or just do not watch the show.  Lastly, Andy Whitfield passed away, and filling his shoes is no easy matter. Mr. McIntyre carries the character and the dialogue very well. (I wish that Naevia's character were played by the same actress, but in real life people get other gigs and if you do a little googling, you find that to be the case.  Everyone has to pay rent and mortgage, no?)",1361059200,,1441,4.444866920152092

Both are very similiar in style and setting...one gets used to the small world of the ludus and the arena in Capua.  However this is much different as it's all around Capua with very little of the main characters in the ludus (no spoiler alert).  Seeing a different actor play Spartacus is a little hard at first, but you get used to it quick - Liam McIntyre is a pretty badass Spartacus.  Nothing against Andy Whitfield (B&S) - he was great, but unfortunately he died.  Literally.  Still a great cast, great production, great scenes!  Highly recommend the ENTIRE series, from Gods through the upcoming War of the Damned.  Starz did a GREAT job with this!

The band of outlaws now hides underground and strikes fear into the hearts of Capua's citizens. Gaius Glaber and his troops are sent to quell the rebellion. With such a powerful enemy, Spartacus and his men will need some luck, cunning, and the help of some unlikely allies. The epic story continues. The blood flows, and the passion burns hotter than ever in the 3rd season of Spartacus.

This series is nothing less than incredible. As most of us know, Andy Whitfield passed away not so long ago. It was his unforgettable performance that launched this series. his absence is why this season deserves 4 stars. It lacks a powerful lead character, but boasts a superb supporting cast. Even without his unparallelled performance, Spartacus still remains a spectacle. The reasons for this are a strong supporting cast, and an engrossing story. The new Spartacus is a shadow of Andy Whitfield, he lacks the passion and charisma that his predecessor displayed. This show remains as powerful as a freight train with no brakes. Propelled by the fire that Andy Whitfield started not so many years ago. If you enjoyed the other 2 season, you will probably find Vengeance to be exciting as well.

But the guy cast for spatacus is good none the less.. but what about Naevia? To me she doesnt look similar at all save for her skin color.

Liam McIntyre isn't Andy Whitfield nor should he be, but the supporting cast of characters make this season a good show.  Their stories take the front and center stage.  Liam is a great replacement for Andy.  I think that the writers did a good job including him in advancing the story. I will buy the last season as well.  The DVD set is certainly cheaper than subscribing to STARZ for those of us who are economically minded.",1359158400,,528,4.447916666666667

It's a shame that the original actor of Spartacus (Andy Whitfield) passed away before they finished the entire series, but the gentleman they replaced him with is a very worthy actor, and shines in Vengeance.

My criticism for this season is the Spartacus actor isn't as good as from the previous season. He's too baby faced and doesn't look like he wants to kill anyone. He also lacks the tension that the other actor had with Illythia.

Then he had a sudden resurgence of cancer from which he was previously in remission, and he was gone. Spartacus: Gods of the Arena came out as a prequel while producers figured out what to do. And then Liam McIntyre became the new Spartacus. While his acting seems to be more poetic than the grittiness and savagery that Andy Whitfield brought to the role, the series is still admirable in the way it tied together both the first season and the prequel. another major cast change was that of Naevia, formerly played by Lesley-Ann Brandt. Cynthia Addai-Robinson, who is now cast in the role, is less delicate, and more warrior than wallflower. Very interesting plot twists, and a very satisfying ending for  Spartacus fans.",1357862400,2,840,4.874125874125874

With some of the actor changes, including Spartacus due to Andy's early passing, it seems like a different show or perhaps better to think of it as a sequel.

5052884,5,B0072OFOM6,"I watched the 10-episode season of Spartacus: Vengeance. What an amazing story. I won't give too many spoilers, but in many ways, this is the best season of Spartacus yet.

If you're new to the series, you can start with Spartacus: Gods of the Arena. That's the prequel they filmed when series star Andy Whitfield got sick.

Andy had filmed the original series, Spartacus: Blood and Sand, which got everything off to an impressive start. Co-stars John Hannah and Lucy Lawless were brilliant, the entire cast was top-notch, and the story-line was epic. Blood and Sand ends in a rebellion that claims the lives of Hannah's and Lawless' characters, and the story was set to boil over into the next season.

Then Whitfield came down with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He took time off to fight his disease. In a stroke of genius, the show's creators decided to show what happened at the gladiator school BEFORE Spartacus arrived. We were introduced to MORE amazing actors and characters, and Hannah and Lawless got to explore depths of their treacherous yet devoted characters that are some of the best roles written for anybody - ever. Gods of the Arena is really the story of Hannah and Lawless' characters, and their incredible scheming.

Sadly, Whitfield lost his battle with lymphoma. So when it came time to cast the next season, Spartacus: Vengeance, the show's producers picked Liam McIntyre, who looks a lot like Andy. Stunt-casting like that usually fails, and Liam plays a more warm, less cold-blooded Spartacus. This will rub some viewers as wrong, but if you accept that personal growth is a big part of the story, it actually works.

Spartacus: Vengeance takes place after the events of Spartacus: Blood and Sand so is called ""season 2"" in a move that will confuse many viewers. The producers sweetened the plot by bringing back Lucy Lawless' character, Lucretia. Though she seemed dead at the end of ""Blood and Sand,"" they found a way to bring her back, totally mad after the events that saw her house, marriage and life ruined.

Spartacus: Vengeance tells the story of the early stage of the Spartacan rebellion, or Third Servile War. And there is enough intrigue, back-stabbing, and plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. If you liked Lucretica's scheming, just wait till you see what Ilithyia, played by Viva Bianca, gets up to. The ending is both horrific and satisfying, and makes this the role of Lucy Lawless' career. Xena, Shmeena!

Vengeance is a season in which most characters ask themselves: ""What's next?""  For Spartacus, it's ""What's next after I pull off a slave rebellion?"" His answer is a quest to find love with Mira (maybe) and definitely vengeance on Glaber, the Roman senator who first hired him as a mercenary then sold Spartacus and his wife into slavery.

for loyal Crixus, what's next is to find redemption saving Naevia -- their illicit love ended with her being sent off to the mines.  Crixus is obsessed with freeing her.

For Doctore/Oenomaus, what's next is how to find honor after he's lost it all. We learn Oenomaus' backstory. You thought maybe you learned his history in the prequel, Gods of the Arena.  There's a lot more to the man.

For Gannicus, the freed gladiator, what's next is finding something to live for.  His character has been adrift since Gods of the Arena. Can Spartacus inspire Gannicus with new purpose?

You probably know that Spartacus is based on a real person, though very little is known about him. Gannicus, Crixus and Oenomaus were all real gladiator/rebels as well. One change is that in real life, Oenomaus was a Gaul; they make him a Nubian for the series so they could use Peter Mensah, a martial arts master who is also a masterful actor.

And I have to mention actor Nick Tarabay, who plays scheming gladiator and all-around scumbag Ashur. He's not a historical figure, but seems modeled after the character Aaron from Titus Andronicus; the character who boasted:

""I have done a thousand dreadful things
As willingly as one would kill a fly,
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
But that I cannot do ten thousand more""

Speaking of Shakespeare, the language of TV's Spartacus will seem Shakepearean at times. To get that effect, the writers translated Roman texts -- words and phrases -- literally and incorporated them into the scripts. The language really helps transport you to another time.

If you liked Rome, if you liked the Sopranos, consider TV's Spartacus. The show is not for kids or even teens, or anyone with a weak stomach. But it is awesome.",1355356800,6,4538,4.824742268041237
5052885,5,B0072OFOM6,Was a bit apprehensive going into this season without Andy Whitfield and yes he plays Spartacus a bit different but it works and also this season introduced us to secondary characters from season one and new ones who flowed extremely well with new Sparty and made for an epic season. Saddened by the fact next season is the last but it will be one amazing ending much like this one.,1355356800,,382,4.4714285714285715
5052886,5,B0072OFOM6,"I had my doubts going into season two with the much too early passing of Andy Whitfield as he was the perfect choice for the role of Spartacus. Liam McIntyre stepped in and filled the larger than life shoes left by Andy and he did an excellent job of taking over as Spartacus. Andy can never be replaced but Liam brought his own style to the character and Season 2 was very enjoyable. I am looking forward to the final season, Season 3. Rest in piece, Andy.",1355356800,3,457,4.264367816091954
5052887,3,B0072OFOM6,"LOVED the hell out of ""Blood and Sand"" and ""Gods of the Arena"".  But the second season of the Spartacus saga (or unofficial THIRD season, depending how you look at it), called ""Vengeance,"" well, not so much.  This season, the bad outweighs the good.

1) Liam Mcintyre, the actor picked as the ""replacement"" Spartacus, pales in comparison to the original Spartacus played by the wonderful Andy Whitfield.  Liam has none of the charisma, presence, personality, physical prowess or acting skills that Andy had.  And consequently, the character Spartacus is now a total bore to watch.

2) Worse yet in the actor department, the wonderful actress Lesley-Ann Brandt (who played the character Naevia in ""Blood"" and ""Gods"") left the show and was replaced by the horrendously awful actress Cynthia Addai-Robinson.  Whenever Cynthia Addai-Robinson is on-screen the show is unwatchable.  Her acting is cringeworthy and she seems so out-of-place in comparison to every other actor on the show.  The producers of the show just could not have cast a worse actress to replace Lesley-Ann Brandt as Naevia.

3) The action ""style"" of the show has gotten WORSE.  Instead of toning down the stupid ""300"" style action scenes, in this season the producers dramatically increased the irritating super slow-motion action and ridiculous looking gushing geysers of fake looking blood.  At this point the show might as well just become a cartoon or video game, because the action is just that goofy looking.  There's just ZERO imagination or creativity going into the fights and violence of this show now.

4) The writing was very weak this season.  Seems like the writers really struggled this time out to come up with decent story lines, and the stories they did come up with mostly felt either rushed, underdeveloped, overcooked or nonsensical.  For example, the Seppius and Seppia characters seemed like great new additions to the show, but both were killed off, making their additions to the show seemingly pointless.  Likewise, the storyline involving hot new blonde Chadara went NOWHERE (again she was killed off before her story could develop).  And Lucy Lawless' character Lucretia really felt like she had little place in the season; her character turned into a mess and really served no purpose.  Also, Spartacus's tiny ""army"" of rebellious slaves started off strong, planning attacks and pulling off miraculous rescues of other slaves, but then mid-season they just sort of bog down at a temple and just sort of sit there waiting to get attacked for a very long period.  It became boring.

5) The expected ""love story"" between Spartacus and Mira also seemed to be a non-starter.  It never developed into anything close to a love story, and then, spoiler alert, Mira dies, killing of any chance of a love story to bloom in the next (last) season.  Similarly, the relationship between Crixus and Naevia went nowhere.  The roller coaster relationship between Ilithyia and Glaber was the best ""relationship"" in the season, especially earlier on when Ilithyia was trying to leave Glaber.

Overall, a huge disappointment.  But then the standards set were SO high.  ""Blood and Sand"" and ""Gods of the Arena"" are just so awesome.  It's hard for any show to maintain that level of greatness.",1355270400,,3266,5.0655430711610485

5052927,1,B0072OFOM6,There was too much killing and gore with no plot or suspense.  The acting was terrible as well.  Wish we hadn't ordered it.,1353801600,5,123,4.304347826086956
5052928,5,B0072OFOM6,"I don't have star and don't want it cuz this is the only show on the network that is worth my time. Spartacus is a new age Rome(HBO). It has everything a series should have. Love, sex, violence.",1353715200,,194,4.131578947368421

5052930,5,B0072OFOM6,"Even though I know the history of Spartacus, this DVD kept me on the edge of my seat.  All the major characters from Season I are here.

Some I hated and wanted them ""to get theirs"".  I was not disappointed.  There are so many character and plot twists that kept me glued to the set to see how they would be resolved.

But, by far, the special effects are spectacular.  This series is noted for its blood and gore.  It's so frightening that you want to turn away, but cannot.

The stunt coordinators show the techniques that enabled these spectacular movements.

This one is better than the first in character and cultural development.  I cannot wait until I get Season III",1353715200,,673,4.487603305785124

Every actor and actress did a terrific job and the season finally is by far tops season finale. If you are a fan of Gladiator, 300, and the Rome series, this show will not let you down. If you haven't seen season 1, it's best to watch it to play catch up.",1353542400,,419,4.25

5052940,5,B0072OFOM6,I found this season of Spartacus Vengeance fascinating for these reasons: very strong performances from all the cast members who are great actors in their own right. I very much loved Andy Whitfield and was so hurt and disappointed when he died. I had serious doubts about whether any further episodes would be able to hold my attention. I was thankfully wrong. Liam Mcintyre is not Andy but I feel he did this job to the best of his ability. He had a very heavy burden to carry. I feel the entire cast gave performances worthy of Oscar nominations. I'm trying to figure out how the writers are going to top this season in what is supposed to be the last with season 3. I look forward to War of the Damned. I recommend adding this DVD to your Spartacus collection.,1353196800,,764,4.425531914893617

5052942,2,B0072OFOM6,"This is what happens when you take an edgy, well written and well acted show and turn it into a 'b' or even 'c' type series...  toss in more fighting, toss in porn like sex (at least in the first season, there seemed to be a reason), and hope that the viewers will be distracted enough to not notice that the storylines have gotten weaker and more drawn out, that the dialog has become somewhat goofy, that the fight choreography is more quick kill then battle, that the acting seems 'anxious'....  Yes, Andy Whitfield is certainly missed, moreso as it seems like after his death, everyone associated with the show seems to have lost their enthusiasm and is now just going through the motions to meet a deadline instead of put a really fantastic show/story together...",1352937600,7,768,4.639705882352941

5052945,2,B0072OFOM6,"Listen, I'm a fan. A big one. I own Season 1 and Gods Of The Arena. There was this continuity, flow and rhythm. You were drawn in and it felt as if you'd known the characters forever. In ""Vengence"" they introduce almost a whole new cast. Who are they? Where is the connection? The writers apparently chose to slap us across the face with numerous new story lines so as to shift the focus from the loss of Andy.

Liam, God bless him. What is he?...19 years old?? Spartacus appeared to be a man in his 30's! Why would the producers make such an obvious mistake? He may look somewhat like Andy but he could not act like the Spartacus we've come to love and cheer for. I gave Liam 4-5 episodes to grow on me. It just never happened. The remaining cast is brilliant.

I am disappointed. I bought the ""Vengence"" series to find out what happened after the blood bath in ""Kill Them All"". This new season is full of rabbit trails and I found myself lost at times. I really wanted to love this season as much as the first two, but I don't. :( Things pick up around episode 6 but it should not have taken that long to rev things up.

I don't regret the purchase. It was worth it to see what happens to everyone else in Spartacus's world.",1352505600,,1226,4.208510638297873

If you like the movie 300, then you will love this movie, as this movie is filmed, directed and basically put together in the same way. Of course this is NOT a rental...It's recommended that you buy this in Blue Ray! It's (Damn) good!  Just NOT for Kids due to all of the shocking sex acts, male to male, female to female, and full Genital male and female exposure. Shocking! I totally did not expect that.

I can't get enough of spartacus the women are sexy and the men are loaded with high levels of testosterone. andy whitfield is sadly missed by family friends and fans.

The producers have lost a loyal viewer and I really wanted them to find someone to fill the first Spartacus's shoes. In my opinion, they simply looked for someone that resembled Andy Whitfield. I don't think Mcintyre was able to carry the role physically and as an actor, and I felt he was upstaged by his costars.

5052954,2,B0072OFOM6,"There is little depth or intrigue in this season as it largely is just fighting and sex scenes.  The first season had fighting and sex scenes, but they fit well within the story.  I think the main flaw in this season is that it is not character-driven.  It's all about winning victory over the Romans - so they focus on fighting - but there is no real reason why the audience should care who wins.  I didn't feel emotionally attached to any of the characters and felt disconnected from the entire season.

Preseason and 1st season - excellent - they were character focused with a particular focus on the rise of Batiatus - not just on fighting.

This season was horrible.  I'd only plan to watch the next season if I can watch it for free and I'm very bored.",1351900800,,758,4.371428571428571

We don't have Starz, so we hadn't seen this season yet. But if you loved the first season, you must have this blu ray. It's beautiful. The colors, the clarity, the action scenes--spectacular. I would actually recommend investing in a four disk blu-ray set when the final season is released.
As for the actual contents of this season, it's epic and poetic, but nothing compares to Andy Whitfield's performance in season 1. I believe the writers anticipated this, because this third season isn't entirely focused on Spartacus.

5053009,5,B0072OFOM6,"SPARTACUS:VENGEANCE is a production of epic and monumental proportions. There is nothing even remotely like it on TV. The lavish sets and  visual effects are beyond description.
Although it is billed as the SECOND SEASON of SPARTACUS, fans will know it is technically the third season. When Spartacus star Andy Whitfied took ill, STARZ kept the series alive by doing a prequel showing the House of Batiatus before the arrival of Spartacus. Everyone hoped Whitfield would recover and return to the sadly. Sadly, he lost his battle on September 11, 2011.

VENGEANCE takes us to 6 weeks after the massacre that ended Season One. Liam McIntyre has replaced Whitfield as Spartacus. McIntyre looks a lot like Whitfield although a bit younger. The transition works and the series is kept alive. The fantastic Lucy Lawless is back as Lucretia in her her conniving evilness. It's a violent and volatile time in the Roman Empire and the slaves and gladiators of the House of Batiatus are out for revenge and justice.

Despite the murder of his beloved wife and his enslavement, the Spartacus of Vengeance takes the high ground morally. His desire for revenge is directed to Gaius Claudius Glaber but there is no desire to seek revenge from innocent people. This ease to constant disagreement among Spartacus and the men and women in his group. The ranks of the freed slaves grow and the band becomes a very real threat to the Roman Empire.

This is an amazing show but be warned. It is not for the squeamish or those who are easily offended. It's definitely not a show for the whole family. The bloodbath and novel ways of killing people never ends. The sex can be rather explicit but this was ancient Rome afterall. The show reaches new levels of bloodspurting wounds. The killings and blood move in poetic slow motion. Visual Effects are advancing at an almost daily rate and the show takes advantage of being able to show more blood and gore.

The effects are stunning and the destruction of the arena is the most incredible visual effects I have ever seen on TV. It cannot be missed.
It was an amazing and violent time in the world and the producer strive for authenticity along with their fantasy.

History tells us that a man named Spartacus did lead a slave revolt around 70 BC. Records tell little about him,  but it is interesting to know that this series is based on a real person and real events that obviously have been fictionalized because of the lack of historical documentation.

The cast is absolutely amazing. I enjoy the fact that shows set in ancient Rome add an authenticity by having actors speak British English. The ruling class and wealthy speak a more posh English while lower classes speak a working class British English. Somehow it all works. A ""new"" language and manner of speaking is created to represent the latin-speaking Romans.

Liam McIntyre does a fine job in his role as Spartacus. It must have been difficult to fill Andy Whitfield's shoes. The end of episode one's credits leaves us with a picture of Whitfield as a memorial. He is never mentioned again even in the bonus features. Maybe the tragedy of his death was too dark to even mention on this show.

VENGEANCE is loaded with special features that are a must see to fans of the show. It is amazing to see how the visual effects were created and how the sets were built. The explanation of how the arena was destroyed cannot be missed. Again, this is something I have never seen before and it was remarkable.

I love this show but it definitely is not for everyone. It's the kind of show some people will love and others will turn away in disgust from the blood and violence. Whatever your opinion is of the story, VENGEANCE is a remarkable example of how a talented cast and crew and visual effects can recreate a remarkable time in history.",1348963200,,3827,4.680059523809524

initially this season is a little awkward at the beginning following the real life passing of season ones sparticus Andy whitfeild. As sparticus Andy was charasmatic and bought great heart and humanity to a world of violance. Replacing Andy is Liam McIntyre, Liam had huge shoes to fill and he fills them admirably and makes sparticus his own without straying to far from Andys Sparticus, surely not an easy feet.
In this series Sparicus leads the slave rebelion in a war against the Roman's, i don't really want to discuss to many of the plot lines, watch it for yourself, you will be entertained.

5053013,5,B0072OFOM6,"FINALLY!  Yeah, I was one of those people who didn't have `STARZ' but DID have Netflix.  Unfortunately Netflix was being stupid (or maybe it was STARZ) but for whatever reason, I was unable to stream this ""season"" of `Spartacus'.  I had to suffer (first world suffering mind you, but still suffering) through all the FaceBook and Twitter updates from my friends and the cast members of `Spartacus'.  I did well in avoiding it but it was hard, hard, hard.  I didn't line up at midnight to get this DVD boxed set, but I was one of the first.

Was it worth the wait?  Yes!  Was I disappointed that there were only ten episodes?  Hell yes!  I don't follow `Spartacus' enough to know why there are only ten episodes, but finding that out was a bit of a disappointment.  Despite this meager offering, the ten episodes are VERY good!  And I do mean very, very, very good!  There is plenty of blood, sex, drama, fighting, death, gore, skin, and intersecting story lines to keep you hooked for the ten episodes.  I tried my best to space it out but I gave up after episode 2.  I ran through those DVD's like a gladius through soggy intestine.  The new Navia was a treat for the eyes and Ilithya is just... damn... hell hath no fury as Ilithya scorned!

I know people are obsessed with the blood, sex, and tears this show is known for but what keeps me glued is the story.  (OK, OK, seeing a bare chested Mira and Naevia doesn't hurt) So many twists, so many turns, so many things you don't see coming.  Our favorite characters are back and they are bathed in blood, booty, and unbreakable bonds.  Do yourself a favor and pick one weekend to watch this DVD.  Get it out the way... so you can watch it again.

In some strange twist of fate I was reading `Spartacus: Rebellion' by Ben Kane at the same time I was viewing this DVD.  So like a female pleasure slave, I was getting it from both ends.  It was very interesting to see the differences between the two.  Since there is very little literature/written history on Spartacus there is a lot of room to ""fill in"" and embellish on the true myth that is the man.  I laugh at the idiots who actually take time to form an argument about how this series isn't accurate.  ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!?  This is entertainment!  Pure and simple!!

I truly enjoyed every episode in this DVD but my favorites were #5 and #10.  Matter of fact I shouted on very loud s-bomb in the middle of #5 that pretty much woke up the house.  Episode #10 I must have watched the last fifteen minutes five or six times.  Not joking.  All in all this was a very good DVD, but at only ten episodes calling this a season is a joke.  I hope the cast and crew are given more time to really bring it home with `Spartacus: War of the Damned'.",1348790400,,2742,4.320235756385069

5053021,3,B0072OFOM6,"I watched ""Spartacus; the First Season and, while recognizing that it was completely 'over-the-top', rather enjoyed it for what it was.  It was a barely historical drama of ancient, terrible, oftentimes ridiculous, behavior.  The 'Second Season' has all of the defects of the 'First Season' and few of its---aaahhhh---virtues.  It is nonstop slaughter and sexual depravity.  Skin is torn, skulls cleaved, limbs hacked off, abdomens impaled, necks pierced, intestines drawn out ad infinitum.  Blood splashes everywhere, especially on the camera lens.

Now all of these things might be regarded as semi-artistic but the video techniques for demonstrating combat and violence leave a LOT to be desired.  There is a cartoonish nature to the whole thing.  The sex scenes, primarily soldier/gladiator orgies [were gladiators permitted to 'spend' themselves in orgies?], are so gross as to be almost funny.  Brutal sex is often terminated by Spartacus breaking up the party with a spear or sword.

Oh.  Worst of All.  By far, the worst of all, is the audio on my Amazon DVD.  The voices as so fuzzy and muffled that I had to attempt to figure out the story from the action.  Probably I would have felt better about the film, even with its historically thin premise, had I been able to follow the dialogue.",1348358400,,1298,5.032863849765258

They share some similarity in appearance with the biggest discrepancy being their physique.  The new Spartacus is fairly small and weak looking, but he pulls off the character well pretty.  It's good to see most of the other main characters return.  Spartacus is still an awesome show with lots of action and drama.  Sometimes they go a little overboard with the blood.  For example, someone gets headbutted or a minor cut with a sword and a gallon of blood comes flying out.  I'd rather see it a little more realistic, but then again this is an over-the-top show.  If you liked the first season and the prequel, it's a no brainer you need to see this complete second season.  Now I have another long wait until the next season!",1348272000,,895,4.509316770186335

5053027,2,B0072OFOM6,"I would like to begin this review by saying that I am a big fan of the first season as well as its prequel season of Spartacus. Also, the point of this review is to help inform people who like the show, but have not watched this season as of yet, of the changes between this season and seasons past.

There are a few notable differences between Vengeance and its predecessors. Most notably, Andy Whitefield has been replaced by another actor due to his untimely death. I feel that this change, while unavoidable, was a major detraction. The emotion of the character, Spartacus, is just not on the same level as Andy's performance. Aside from the lead actor, another prominent role has been re-cast, and again not for the better. Naevea has been replaced by someone who is once again, not right for the role. The scenes between her and Crixus have even made me not like his charatcer this season.

In addition to the bad acting and bad casting, the writing seems to have gone WAY downhill. What brought this about I do not know. All I do know is that this season is a MAJOR disappointment to myself, and I know more than a few others. Judging by the four star average on here, people seem to have liked this season, but I felt I needed to add my own opinion on Vengeance. For any of you thinking about buying this, find a way to watch one or two episodes from this season before spending $30 on the show.",1347926400,6,1403,4.371647509578544
5053028,2,B0072OFOM6,"The first season and the prequel were great. Vengeance was weak.  The character of Spartacus was poorly cast, and it didn't help having the storyline they wrote for him.  The guy's all of a sudden changed to a politician, giving speeches every episode to a disorganized horde to stop them from destroying each other, followed by, ""Yeeeaaaahhhh!!!""  Lots of times the story gets goofy and unbelievable.  The new Naevia isn't good either.

The thing that made Spartacus work before was Batiatus.  Without him, and combined with the loss of Andy Whitfield, it's just over.  I understand that if the story were to continue any further, the story of the ludus and the arena needed to end.  But the current cast of characters, without a great lead actor or two, and the lack of good writing to make up for it has ruined the show.  And with the people who were killed off at the end of Vengeance, it makes the next and final season seem like there's absolutely no hope for an ending worth watching.",1347840000,3,991,4.617142857142857

Crixus is captured by the Roman soldiers. They bring Crixus and two other gladiator captives before Glaber and he has them put into cells.

Roman soldiers are in the fog and forest looking for the gladiators and Naevia from the mine. The gladiators and slaves are hidden but Naevia panics and the soldiers attack. Mira kills a soldier who is going to kill Naevia.  The gladiators kill the soldiers but one gladiator is killed and the surviving number dwindles dangerously low.

Lucretia continues to speak for the gods in prophecies that seem to always come true while Llithyia betrays her husband, Glaber, for the affection of a more powerful man......

That being said his replacement made the transition seem near seamless. It certainly could have been a lot worse.

This episode introduction of Lucius is a master stroke and I hope they remember this for the final season. No all Romans are evil slaveowners or enfranchised elites. People like Lucius were part of the rebellion too, because they were forced from their homes, their families murdered by Roman politics, and they had nothing more to lose like the slaves.

It's also a good lesson in modern politics, don't force people into the wall or else they might join the most extreme elements of your society.",1347753600,,737,4.7952755905511815
5053032,4,B0072OFOM6,"The problem with the second season of Spartacus is that since the Romans and the gladiators are no longer living under the same roof, every episode is effectively divided up into Roman scenes and gladiator scenes, and their is no question which are more interesting. The cruel, scheming, ambitious Romans remain endlessly watchable, whereas the gladiators when left to themselves do nothing but engage in endless debates about the meaning of freedom and the conduct of war. Which would you rather watch, a roomful of drunken, sex-craved Roman aristocrats torturing a captured ex-slave to death by flaying him alive, or a roomful of ex-gladiators debating the ethics of slave rebellion? The gladiators only come to life when in direct conflict with the Romans, as in the spectacular immolation of the arena in Capua (a superb sequence) or in titillating episodes like the one in which Spartacus and his men invade a brothel and impale all the naked customers on their swords as the victims' backsides wriggle (in close up), their private parts flop about (ditto), and the television screen is covered in gore.

The problem is not the actors, all of whom do their best. The problem is that the writers have a habit of confusing their series with the classic Kirk Douglas movie, wanting to infuse it with some of that old epic's high moral seriousness. It doesn't work. The sermonizing is hard to take in a series like this. Spartacus the TV series (NOT Spartacus the movie) is essentially high gloss soft porn dignified by some remarkably intelligent acting and superb production values. (I could watch Lucy Lawless smirk and glower for hours without becoming bored.) To be honest, I'm more interested in Spartacus the half-naked crazed killer than in Spartacus the philosopher. (There is also a serious plausibility problem. How did all these brutalized trained killers turn into Thomas Jeffersons?)

At it's best, Spartacus remains tremendous fun and I'm looking forward to the final season. I just hope their will be more sex and gore, and less moral posturing. Nevertheless, I have to conclude by stating that since all of the most interesting characters are dead now, I have no idea how the writers are going to pull it off.",1347667200,2,2227,4.967828418230563

Season one and the prequel are very good but this Vengence season did not have the edge of your seat thrill ride like season one or the prequel. The story lines in Vengence were so weak and so was the acting, but then again I'd have to blame it on the writing, which I don't believe the actors could have delivered it any other way. And last but not least, the new Spartacus is not believable at all. He tries to talk like he's authoritative but it comes off as hokey and corny. And what's with everyone having to yell every time they swing a sword? This season left me disappointed.

Hell, for that matter, I shall also add a third word: addictive - you just can't get enough. And if you thought that the first two installments of the series, ""Spartacus: Gods of the Arena"" and ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand,"" could not be surpassed, think again. The writers keep it excitingly fresh and honest.

After two seasons, for a lack of a better word (""Spartacus Vengeance"" is labeled as the second season), we now find Spartacus and his fellow slaves free, after terminating Batiatus' empire. If you recall, Batiatus (John Hannah) was the mighty owner of the best gladiators in the town of Capua. However, even though the gladiators are free, they are still slaves and the Romans will do anything to get them back. This time, the Roman-in- charge and the new owner of the Batiatus house is Glaber (Craig Parker, who does a great job). Glaber, as we know, is married to Ilithyia (Viva Bianca), who barely escaped the wrath of Spartacus and his followers when they ended Batiatus' regime. In addition, it is also known that Spartacus, who was originally played by Andy Whitfield, who died at the height of his career due to cancer, was replaced by Liam McIntyre. He commands an impressive group of gladiators and slaves - both male and females --, including Crixus (Manu Bennett), Doctore (Peter Mensah), Mira (Katrina Law), Agron (Daniel Feuerriegel), and others. Spartacus keeps freeing and recruiting slaves throughout the region, always telling his people that ""an empty hand can yet become a fist"" and ""even the mighty republic bleeds when stricken.""  Of course, along the way we will find new faces and the return of older ones who we thought were gone for good. There are also mutinies within Spartacus' troops, and all is done well. My favorite episode is ""Libertus,"" number five of the season, which by itself could have been a movie. I couldn't believe my eyes while watching it and I was at the edge of my seat. What suspense! What a show! The final and tenth episode, ""Wrath of the Gods,"" is also as good as it gets, and closes the season in a satisfying and majestic manner.

""Spartacus Vengeance"" has elements of ""Apocalypse Now,"" Hitchcock, James Bond, ""The Godfather,"" ""Caligula"" (Tinto Brass' version), and more; you can see the influences on the filmmakers. The violence gets more gruesome (if that is possible) and the sex is more graphic, without being x-rated (or NR-rated?), and I have to confess that, even though I am not a fan of today's brand of violence (especially the new wave of horror movies), this series is my guilty pleasure. Ah, of course there is also the nudity - male and female - which is a delight to any sexual preference. And then there is the matter of Liam McIntyre replacing Andy Whitfield. Personally, I didn't have a problem with it, as the action and plot keeps you busy. However, that said, I was surprised by Viva Bianca's incredible range of acting on this particular season. I was also impressed by Katrina Law, who was a perfect partner for Spartacus. Both of them, I believe, stole the show from the others, including the males.  Now, of course, we have to wait for what is supposed to be the final season of this spectacular series: ""War of the Damned.""  Knowing Spartacus' end in real life, according to history and in Stanley Kubrick's film, is kind of hard to just think about it, and I hope that the filmmakers have the wisdom on how to give the series a great closure. A hint of that end is given in one of the episodes. The DVD edition includes the season's ten episodes, Starz studios used for Spartacus, a making-of feature, bloopers, a teaser for  ""Spartacus: War of the Damned,"" and much more. (USA, 2012, color, 556 min plus additional materials).

However, the story respectfully continues the struggle for freedom, both personnally & as a community. So goes the telling of Spartacus. There will be one more season to tell the ending of his story. I look forward to pre-ordering the final DVD set as soon as Amazon allows (beter sooner than later).  I can't hardly wait for my copy to arive ""soon"" from Amazon.  I placed my pre-order on 02-06-2012 when the price was at $34.99; on 09-11-2012 the price was at $19.99 (at 3:13pm PDT);
so what happened to the ""lowest price guarantee"" ???  I paid by Amazon giftcard. So, why hasn't my Amazon giftcard been reimbursed 15.00 (34.99 - 19.99 = 15.00)???
You will get a much deeper understanding of history & human nature by watching this extended series that is both edifing & enlightening :) :) :)

As for season 2 review , it got off on a slow start. first getting used to a new main star  . and second missing Andy Whitfield in the part. With the other shows that Starz had on tv such as CAMALOT an MAGIC CITY  , both flopped . Starz lost a big gamble trying to keep up with the big boy HBO an lost . It shows by what movies they keep repeating without any new ones . Too bad that SPARTACUS , had to suffer for this bad programing problem, cuz an actor worked His life away trying to make us happy an wanted to keep it going after He died. BLOOD AND SANDS  was awesome , John Hannah was clever backstabber along with the ruthless Lucy Lawless as His wife who ran their arena of death. The bravdo of Spartacus as He rose to the top an how We cheered as he said "" kill them all ' !Then the bad news of the cancer, the deley an then they made GODS OF THE ARENA , a prequel that was quite a good back story . then the news that Whitfield died, an picked a new SPARTACUS, but things didn't work out good since STARZ was losing money ..fast , and decided to cut the story down an yeah , kill off many characters toward the end of season 2 . Well to bring in new characters for the final season. Thete wasn't much they could do with them any way, the producers most likely said. Well season 3 should be a 'hell of a great story "" . The trailer shows a massive battle with hundreds of soldiers an Rebels. I would had loved to saw another season , but that isn't going to happen . Im will be in line or be ordering my copy of "" VENGENCE"" on amazon,and when season 4 comes out the same , i hope you will do the same. see ya at the checkout line !",1344038400,,1790,3.845528455284553

I loved the 2nd ( 3rd ) season hands down. 2 problems I had, why the original nivea wasn't used was a big disappointment. The lady playing her now is awful. That ruined it for me, shes a bad actress and nowhere near how pretty other nivea was. Most importantly, take your hand off the slow motion button. Please it was just too much slow motion in this season. Almost every swing or stab was slowed down. I pray they don't do that again in the next and final season.

If I had to rate the seasons this would be third place but John Hannah was simply amazing in the other seasons and nobody really stepped up to replace his good acting. I can't wait until the final season though.",1343260800,,485,4.11578947368421
5053040,3,B0072OFOM6,"Like so many I loved Blood & Sand, and Gods of the Arena. However, I felt that this season lacked so much from the previous two Seasons. The storylines were rushed and left you scratching your head. There several frayed ropes that left you hanging for more. Liam, I'm sure is a fine actor, but lacks the compassion/conviction in his facial expressions that Andy (RIP) possessed. I found his acting a little dull in this role, and forgot about his character alot throughout. That's a bad thing when you forget about Spartacus' role in a Spartacus series.

There was just too much going on at once and the plots were a little too telegraphed. I knew what was going to happen before it happened. Not nearly as suspensful as the first two seasons. Lots of creatve ways to die though.

Lucy (F)Lawless was great as usual. I think they could have done more in 2-3 more episodes and sewn up some of the loose ends and character development; such as Sepius & Sepia, Nasir and his long lost Syrian brother, the Egyptian. I also hope that Liam can delve into character and get his exressions going for Season 3. I want more compassion/conviction/animal-survivor instinct...please!!",1343260800,4,1171,4.735294117647059

5053043,5,B0072OFOM6,"This series is one of the most enjoyable I've ever glued my eyes to and also one of the few shows that starts off great and just gets better each week. While everyone is entertained by naked men and women, sex and violence( the fight scene choreography is so different from anything else so far put to screen )one thing remains firm--the writing is extraordinary and the acting meets the challenge. The language is near poetry, and the machinations of the characters are endlessly entertaining---equal to the most magnificent show ever on television I Claudius. I miss terribly John Hannah, who stole the show from day one. Yet the most diabolical characters were Lucretia and Ilythia. They will be surely missed in the final season...unless Lucy's producer/creator husband comes up with a twin sister role for her. Yet I think not because the show must leave behind the small venue of Capua to the big arena ( no pun intended )of Italy itself. Even though we lament that the next season will be the last, we must remember the slave rebellion (the Third Servile War )lasted all of two years. Next comes the maneuvering of Roman senators, Crassus, a young Caesar, the Great Pompey, and Metullus, the First Triumverate. The show tries to be historically accurate as possible within the confines of entertainment, which is why we have the figures Crixus, Gannicus, and Onemaues. It was Crixus who disputed strategy with Spartacus, wanting to return to Gaul (modern day France )instead of escaping by sea via the assistance of Cilesian pirates ( who later on were wiped out by Roman fleets under Pompey)and whose success created a burning rivalry with Caesar. Crixus took about twenty thousand with him, headed north and was exterminated by several Roman legions. Later gaining power Crassus was wiped out by being surrounded by a Parthian host and lost sixty thousand legionnaires. Inadvertenly Spartacus was partially responsible for the decline and end of the Roman Republic.......As far as the conversation of Liam replacing Andy, I had no problem with it because after just rewatching the first season it came to me that Liam had a stronger screen presence than Andy and finer oratory skills and voice quality.

5053044,5,B0072OFOM6,"Spartacus Vengeance is definitely a different season than its predecessors containing new actors, new locations, and a new script.  However different isn't always better; so how does the 2nd season of Spartacus add up?  Well, the answer to that question is simply: great.  New Spartacus actor Liam McIntyre has filled the role of Whitfield with humility, grace, but as important, with ability.  The writers have maintained the same grip over the audience as they had with Arena & Blood and Sand.  The difference & progression of the season is enough to keep you enthralled, but still has that touch that fans have come to love.  I give the season a 5/5 because of my own love for the show, and acceptance for any & all argued flaws (those being story related and minimal at best).  With Spartacus having already amassed a total of three seasons and its finale slated to release 2013, there is little question that Starz has sponsored a successful show that has captured fans from the sands of the arena and to open rebellion.  I recommend the second season and wait eagerly for the War of the Damned 2013.",1339459200,2,1105,4.71875
5053045,4,B0072OFOM6,"The most obvious complaint one could broach about this third season of SPARTACUS (subtitled VENGEANCE) is the portrayal of the titular character by Liam McIntyre. Most fans are still not yet removed far enough from the terribly tragic passing of Andy Whitfield, who played the character with perfection. Most haters of this season say that McIntyre is just not on the same level as Whitfield. Is there truth to that? I think that there is, but it's less about McIntyre's actual abilities as an actor, which are considerable, and more about how much we miss Andy. Liam had some huge shoes to fill, and he knew going in that he was going to get a lot of flak from fans of the show.

Now, I'm not the biggest fan of this series there ever was, but I will admit to my addiction to it. I find this season similarly entertaining and similarly predictible to the first two ""seasons"" of this show, but I was surprised to find that once Liam had been in a few episodes, I felt that it easily could have been him all along, which is certainly NO disrespect to Andy. I will also admit that McIntyre is a little wooden and not as emotional as Whitfield's Spartacus, but that is because this season holds less for Spartacus from an emotional standpoint than BLOOD AND SAND did. Part of Spartacus is already dead in this season, not only through the way that his relationship with Mira is portrayed, but also through his disregard of his own life as he seeks to strike at Glaber in any way he can. The role, and not McIntyre, is wooden. This is what's demanded of him; a role as steel-and-battle-forged leader to the fugitivus he now commands that look to him for leadership and counsel. Solemnity is required of the role now. That, and the uncanny ability to cleave head from Roman neck with a single blow.

What is also a common complaint is that this show, while being extremely entertaining, rarely gives us anything that is truly surprising. We have a set amount of characters that we know nothing is going to happen to, and everyone else is pretty much the equivalent to a STAR TREK ""red shirt"". If we get to know them at all, it's for about five minutes. This is true. The show is very formulaic, but when it does break out the surprises, they're pretty mouth-gaping.

Another common complaint is that this is essentially a mashup of Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR, Zack Snyder's 300, and HBO's brilliant ROME... with a heaping helping of late-night Cinemax for good measure. If you're coming to this show for truly original entertainment, you've looked at the wrong place. There is much politicking in this show, but not as clever or as strongly written as ROME. There is also a feeling that this show acquired its entire visual aesthetic from 300 with a lot or fast-slow-fast fights, dark-light-dark color palette and lots of slo-mo explosions of blood. This is true as well and I invite debate on that point (but only civil debate, please). And as far as GLADIATOR goes... well, that's just from a plot standpoint and somewhat rehashed plot is hardly worth criticism.

Another common complaint was that of a new Naevia, played not by Leslie-Ann Brandt, but Cynthia Addai-Robinson. This is a much different Naevia than was portrayed before, and with good reason. But the skill is there and she makes a fine addition to the cast.

Another common complaint is the dialogue which seems unnatural and overly polished with poetic license. To that I say... close mouth. This is a highly stylized show and it greatly benefits from having equally stylized dialogue.

I don't think that any of the great creative minds that created this series, from Steven S. DeKnight (formerly of the Whedon posse and SMALLVILLE) to Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert, were ever looking to reinvent the wheel here. They took a risk on a somewhat serious show that week after week offered extremely handsome men, extremely beautiful women, and orgiastic showerings of bloody deaths and wild sex. I do think that they do a good deal of justice to the Rome that was, but I'd be more apt to ask a historian about the show's accuracy.

Simply put, this is a very entertaining, and occasionally very smart, show with more than enough to keep even the most jaded fan coming back for more.",1339113600,9,4239,4.659090909090909

5053050,5,B0072OFOM6,"I shall be succinct. Life is unfair!

Case in point, Andy Whitfield. For two years he was the luckiest man in the world and then WHAM! he became the unluckiest man in the world and I say to that, LIFE IS UNFAIR. And there is no God because what God would do such a thing. To play such a cruel joke on this man is unfathomable to me. I sometimes have trouble wrapping my head around it. Yes, I know I did not know the man personally, but damn, that doesn't mean I cannot feel for him. If you watch the early episodes of Blood & Sand you will see the Melanoma on Andy's upper chest and you just want to scream out for him to watch out! But alas, we cannot.

With that in mind, I shall say that Andy's replacement is acceptable. What I mean is, I would have rather not had to have him replaced at all, but if it was necessary then the new Spartacus is okay with me. Not that anybody is looking for my approval, but there it is anyway for you to read.

Spartacus VENGEANCE is a BUY!! As were ""Gods of the Arena"" & ""Blood & Sand"".  BUY THEM ALL! And always, in the back of your mind, be a little sad for Andy who is (I suppose) in a better place. So very sad. And unfair.

Yes, we can take comfort in what Andy left behind for us, his legacy, it's very much appreciated and it shall bring hours and hours of comfort for you too! Blood and death and maiming and killing and scheming...what's not to like! The perfect series in my opinion. Well, except what happened to Andy but other than that, a perfect series. One the world has waited a long time to enjoy. Especially here in the USA where everything is censured all the time. To protect our sad little brains I suppose.

Okay, well, I'm going to stop talking now. Buy it. You won't regret it. Trust me.

5053051,1,B0072OFOM6,"(sorry for the typing errors if there are any.  I typed this on my iphone.  Not the easiest thing to type on)

(also, i should add that I'm a HUGE fan of season 1 AND the prequel)

REVIEW:

How can anyone honestly say this season was any good at all?  I won't go into the writing much, but my god... It was just atrocious.  I won't go into it because it would just take forever.  Lets just leave it at that.  I'll just highlight the low points real quick.

1) When did everything that came out of everyones mouth sound like they were attempting poetry?  I'm sorry, but I doubt they talked like that back then.  The first 2 seasons had exceptional writing where the way they spoke didn't sound so utterly rediculous.  Now, its like they are just reading right off the cue cards.
2)  Is there even a debate as to the writing being worse than a soap opera?  How implausible could things really get?  Again, the first 2 seasons were AMAZING.  What the heck happened?  Did they let the interns write this instead?

3) Did the entire budget go into all the excessive blood they used?  Becasue obviously the budget wasn't spent on anything else.

4(A)  Now the 2 characters they replaced.  First off, Navia (or however you spell her name).  Couldn't have chosen a worse actress, especially for that character.  I'm sorry, but I don't buy that Crixus was in love with..... that.  The old Navia had a certain confidence.  The new chick just plain didn't.  That is a combination of bad writing and her acting... So not ALL her fault.  But she was a terrible actress none-the-less.  Hey Starz... Maybe you should try to secure your actors contracts in your top shows for more than 1 season at a time.. Because when you don't, this is what you get as a replacement.  I guess this is a STARZ policy from what I've read.  They never sign anyone to a contract for more than 1 season.

4(B) Now onto the most unforgivable.  The actor portraying Spartacus.  Now, I'm not a hater when it comes to actor replacements.  In fact, I actually liked Kutcher in ""2.5 Men"".  Not as good as Sheen, but a worthy replacement.  But I'm sorry.  This Liam guy doesnt hold a candle to the one and only Andy Whitfield (RIP).  Has Liam ever made an expression before?  If so, then he sure as hell didn't use any in this show.  It seems like the producers walked down the street looking for a replacement for Andy, and saw this model/pretty boy walking down the street and asked him to portray Spartacus.  Im sorry, but the man just is NOT an actor.  He is a womans magazine cover model.  The guy doesnt even look like he could kill my grandma let alone the entire Roman army.

I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm overly harsh, but im just mad that the producers/writers have screwed up such an awesome show.  If they could do 1 season without its title character, then we know it can be done.  Because frankly, I'd rather say screw it to the Spartacus story line and go back to the Batiatus House... Oh wait... I forgot... You've already killed off your best actor/character.  To bad.

Know this in advance: there are parts of this second season (or third, depending on how you're counting) of the Spartacus saga that _you will not like_.  But the gods do not favor such thoughts!  WE are for Spartacus: Vengeance, preferably on Blu-ray, which has had noticeably better picture and sound quality than the Starz broadcasts.  Bend ear, and I shall give good reasons to make purchase:

- The story is on a par with, possibly even better than, Blood and Sand.  It's different - how could it be otherwise? - but more complex and on a much grander scale. The same goes for the setting. Spartacus has always featured impressive camera work and CGI, and this time around it is, at times, literally jaw-dropping and downright beautiful. Much of S:V looks and feels more like a movie than a TV series.

- The cast outdoes itself yet again. Liam McIntyre takes a couple of episodes to get comfortable with the daunting job of filling Andy Whitfield's sandals, but by mid-season he's rocking Spartacus every bit as hard as Whitfield did.  Cynthia Addai-Robinson takes awhile to get into her role as Naevia (replacing Leslie-Ann Brandt,) but makes up for it and then some in the final episode. All the returnees own their characters in splendid fashion, even when those characters have dramatically changed (see below.)  It's very hard to pick a standout this time, but I'm going with Nick Tarabay. Yeah, Asher, who this time around is pushing his intelligence (he's smarter than he appears) and cunning (he's even more of a snake) to their limits in an attempt to gain real wealth and power.  Tarabay takes what was a relatively minor character in the other series and brings him to the forefront as a downright fascinating, and in a way even tragic, figure.  Where was he hiding this guy in S:B&S?

- Lucy Lawless, who takes her character Lucretia on a horrific roller-coaster ride from wife and house-mistress (with a touch of the Borgia thrown in,) to mad prophetess, to a vengeful slave's plaything, to confidante-and-perhaps-assassin of a powerful family.  You'll be genuinely wondering whether she's crazy-like-a-fox, or just plain crazy, right up to the moment of the Stephen King-worthy climax in the final episode.

- ""Libertus"".  Spartacus and his generals return to the arena in Capua one final time, and the result is the best episode of any of the three series up until this point.  This and the season finale are by themselves worth the price of the entire set.

- ""Wrath of the Gods"".  I didn't think it was possible to top the finale of Blood and Sand.  They did it.

- The bonus features are all worth watching, especially the ""making of"" episode 5 featurette.  For someone who still pictures the lights-camera-action Hollywood stereotype behind the scenes, watching 21st-century state-of-the-art ""filming"" with its complex battle choreography, robotic digital cameras and virtual sets is endlessly fascinating.

To be sure, there are a few problems with S:V:

- First and foremost: only ten episodes.  The whole blasted thing was over and done with inside of three months. And this is weird, because there is easily 13 episodes worth of story here. As others have noted, this means that a number of intriguing plot threads (e.g. Lucretia's rescue from the ludus massacre, and the Seppia / Seppius relationship) were just barely touched upon.  I assume they blew the budget on episodes 5 and 10, but still, ten episodes simply were not enough to tell this story as it should be told.

- As with S:GotA, the story starts out slow, taking a couple of episodes to ramp up.  Clearly the producers' fault for spoiling us with S:B&S, which was solid from end to end. ;)

- It's clear at this point that the producers are making a conscious effort to outdo themselves sex-and-violence-wise with each new season, and in S:V it's actually become a detriment to the show.  We now have the camera lingering on spilled intestines and increasingly-bizarre mutilations for no other reason than ""Hey, look what our effects guys came up with THIS time!""  We also have numerous scenes set in a brothel that clearly exist only to (ahem) insert sex that they couldn't work into the storyline. (This season could have been subtitled ""Meanwhile, back at the whorehouse..."")  S:B&S proved that they can use the sex and gore intelligently to pump up an already good story.  So why go all gratuitous on us now?

- Ten. Episodes.  At a higher price than most other series' 22-episode seasons.  (If history is any guide, however, the price will come down soon after release.)

Sum of topic: Buy it, but wait until the price comes down somewhat.  Five stars, but just barely this time - the length, the price and what is now the almost overbearing sex and gore almost cost it that 5th.",1336521600,60,5179,5.115338882282996
5053054,1,B0072OFOM6,"the first season and the prequel were extremely good... plot, acting, everything. My expetacions towards the second season were high but... there are too many gore and blood (it seems that they wanted to give us ""more and more"" but sometimes is not for the best), it feels that the new actor didn't suffer trough all the madness of the first season, it seems that he took vacations and is well rested. The new actress portraying naevia is a horror. The only episode I felt a bit of the emotion is when gannicus; doctore and crixus were in the arena fighting.

I hope the producers invest more in the plot and in godd actors instead of computer animated scenes in the next seasons",1335744000,9,679,4.520325203252033
5053055,5,B0072OFOM6,"I have to say that after reviewing  season 2, I loved it!! I think that given the weight of what is obviously a daunting task, Liam stepped up and did a fine job.  Granted, Andy gave us a different feel for Spartacus and will never be forgotten for the wonderful job that he did, but I am glad that the show has continued and overall, this cast did a great job.  It took me a little time to get used to the new Naevia, but I think that Cynthia Addai-Robinson was able to really capture the necessary growth that the character had to deal with and rise to become her own person. I especially enjoyed when she was able to grab her own bit of vengeance. She stood as tall as a giant when she did what she had to do and really got the respect of the whole group and showed that she was not helpless. I was watching the replay of episode 10 at 1:30 in the morning and was literally screaming for her as she got some get back.  GREAT JOB!! Don't get me wrong, I thought that Lesley-Ann Brandt really did a wonderful job as Naevia in the first couple of seasons and really brought to life the love story between her and Crixus (which by the way, is one of the main reasons why I tune in, because I love them as a couple).But I wholeheartedly appreciate what Cynthia did for this season as Naevia grew as a woman.  And then, of course,there are my two favorite ladies, Ilythia and Lucretia.  It just would not be as fun  without the machinations of these two, who make doing bad things very interesting to watch, especially since the two of them have absolutely no moral compass and are literally slaves to their own desires, whatever they might be.  I also enjoyed Crixus' evolution.  Crixus has always been one of my favorites on the show and to watch the depth of this man unfold on so many different levels.....Bravo Manu Bennett.  All in all, my recommendation is to purchase this Season of Spartacus Vengeance.  You will DEFINATELY be entertained!!",1335225600,3,1946,4.362880886426593

The show is awesome and do have to agree with most Andy did a wonderful job acting as Spatacus and Liam is doin well concidering the shoes he had to fill. I just hope this show continues till the end as to where Spatacus actually did die.,1334102400,,402,4.302631578947368
5053057,3,B0072OFOM6,"Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena were spectacular! Vengeance was disappointing.

The season was cut from the expected 13 episodes to 10 episodes, which in my opinion, left it wanting. The writers were not able to develop new characters nor the complex story lines in such a short time frame. They integrated a backstory for Oenomaus with his fate right after the breakout, which was simply confusing and unnecessary in season 2. The intricate and complex relationship between Lucretia and Ilithyia was crammed in between murky battle scenes and never developed to the fullest. The new codependent relationship between Lucretia and Ashur was ""explained"" with a 5 second flashback, which was of no use to anyone (most of us) who had already figured out that Ashur was the only one who could have possibly saved her. The two characters, Sepia and Sepius were so undeveloped that one kept going, ""Who? What? Which one is which? Why are they there?"" up to the point of their demise. An incestual relationship between them was hinted at, but was never developed nor explained. In the last episode, deKnight killed off all of the delicious villains as well as some well-loved good guys, leaving his cast decimated (if I may use that word prior to Crassus being introduced). What we are left with is a rag-tag band of rebels, none of whom are terribly interesting as characters. It does not bode well for season 3, where I suspect the story will leave behind all the wonderful political and sexual intrigue and devolve to a bash and slash fest.

On positive note, the one outstanding episode was number 5, which included intrigue, fighting and the spectacular burning of the arena. Yes, I was one of those screaming from my armchair. This episode was directed by Michael Hurst, which I suspect made it the spectacular piece it was. Unfortunately, he directed only this single episode this season.

My only comment about the forced cast changes this season is the new actors had big roles to fill and they did well considering the scripts they had to work with.

Yes, I pre-ordered the Blu-ray for season 2. I doubt I will do so for season 3.",1333670400,16,2137,4.752021563342318
5053058,3,B0072OFOM6,"Season 2 of Spartacus ( Vengeance ) was a good season. It wasn't perfect by any means. I felt a big part of this had to do with bringing Lucretia ( Lucy Lawless) back from season one ( Blood & Sand ) Her arc, along with lllithia; and Ashur ( The AWESOME Nick Tarabay )made this series feel like you was watching an episode of DAYS OF OUR LIVES. Seriously, do we need a soap opera in a show like this ? NO !  What season 2 got right was killing off six major characters in the season finale. Of course, I would've kept Ashur and Oenomaus for season 3.
 Another issue I have about this season, is plot lines that were introduced, and never followed up on. For example, in episode two, we are introduced to Nasir, a body slave, who is freed by Spartacus. Later durning that episode, Nasir is approached by Agron ( Our resident, Angry, and buff gladiator.) What these two have in common is, both of them have brothers...correction...Agron's brother ( Duro ) gave his life to save Agron durning the season 1 finale of Blood & sand. Durning their conversation, Nasir states that ""I recall a brother"". after Agron asked him, ""Do you have family there ?"" Referring to the Ludus which Spartacus and company escaped from. The only other Syrian was Ashur. This was a perfect opportunity for the writers...namely the show's creator ( Steven Deknight ) to link both Nasir and Ashur together. Deknight recently commented, that, Ashur and Nasir was never meant to be brothers. So why introduce that ""brother"" plot in there to begin with ?
It's things like this that makes the series unbalance. You see great potentional fro the characters, and some of their stories are over before they've even begun. One storyline that raised some eyebrows and broke many women's heart was the relationship between Nasir and Agron. Yes, the tough, hardened gladiator actually smacked a big wet kiss on a surprised ( but happy ) Nasir in episode 5 of the series...confessing his love for the former body slave.
If there is one thing the series doesn't shy away from, is sex. There is plenty galore in this series, sometimes between two women, or two men, or lets just make it an orgy. There is also plenty of gore, so...if you don't like seeing blood, this definately isn't the series for you.
The biggest hurdle this series had to over come, was the recasting of the title character. ( After Andy Whitfield's untimely death ) I think Liam Mcintyre, stepped up to the plate, and delivered his own take on the character. He is not as intense as Andy's protrayal...infact...one of Liam's problems ( which really isn't a problem ) is that he is a pretty boy. He puts some ladies on the show to shame really. He's also not as buff/ ripped as Andy. He does make the role his own though, so that is a good thing.
Hopefully Season 3 ( which begins JAN 2013) Will surpass season 2. Out of 5 stars, I would have to give vengeance a 3 1/2 for continuing the series and effort.",1333497600,3,2935,4.49438202247191
5053059,1,B0072OFOM6,"Where do I begin? The show's budget seems to have been reduced more, despite claims otherwise. There is no plot anymore. Every show is one excuse after the other to start a fight. Blood and gore, for any reason whatsoever. I loved last season, but this one was utterly sadistic to the point of discomfort and uneasiness. It starts getting really bad around episode five. The actor cast to replace Spartacus does a fine job, but the dialogue and writing failed him, as it did the other characters. The actress that replaced Naevia from season one, due to contract issues, is vastly inferior to her, acting-wise. She is so terrible, it takes the viewer out of the show. The writing is so bad, that all the characters are mere shadows of the season one self. It almost seems like this show has ignored its classy fans in favor of the UFC/WWE element this season. The show is, as I've heard others describe, now a Saturday Morning Cartoon. There are numerous, illogical encounters between Spartacus and the main villain this season, Glaber, almost like how Megatron and Optimus Prime used to duke it out in their various respective cartoon versions of the years. To add insult to injury, the show added a mute, invincible villain named The Egyptian, whose main purpose in the show probably is to appeal to junior high boys and sell toys.

The IQ of this show has dropped so much from past seasons. Anyone longing for the complex, adult plot and writing from Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena will be disappointed so much, it will be like getting smacked by the hilt of Crixus's sword. From what I read from various comments around the internet, the season finale was the last straw for many viewers. It was ridiculous. There were several jump the shark moments. While there was one scene that struck me as disgusting and sick, it was the lone bright spot of the finale, if not the season, but it will haunt you for days to come. What happens in that scene, was also the reason many fans have decided to quit this show.

Do like I did; forget this season ever existed and cherish your copies of Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena. There's no point bothering with Vengeance. I can't think of anything the season did to advance the characters or the story, and that honestly, was a disgrace.",1333411200,39,2289,4.5669099756691
5053060,2,B0072OFOM6,"Aside from the new Spartacus, who's acting is not that good, and his all too innocent, pathetic looking eyes, which are not suited to his role, his eyes lack the passion and determination that the tragic Whitfield had. The storyline was slow, dull, and not worthy of a second season.

I loved the prequel and the first season, great storylines and intriguing characters.  The characters in season two are quite simply dull.

Lucy Lawless does an astonishing job, her talent was the only thing that kept me watching, and sadly is the only redeeming quality in a series that was once so eye-openingly brilliant.

I rated this as a 2 stars only because I enjoy Imperial Roman genres and for the quality of Lucy Lawless's performances.",1333411200,12,731,4.777777777777778
5053061,4,B0072OFOM6,"First, for those that may not have seen Spartacus on Starz and are looking to get into the series via DVD based on its popularity, Spartacus: Vengeance is season 2 of the show but technically the third season. After the excellent 2010 5-star season premier under the title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spartacus-Blood-and-Sand/dp/B003PIUC02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spartacus: Blood and Sand</a>, Andy Whitfield who played the lead role of Spartacus tragically died of cancer. Whitfield embodied Spartacus; he was a believable, imposing, rough, tough character that made viewers feel like they were watching the real guy from circa 70 BC. His untimely illness left the studio scrambling to decide how to or if the series would continue. Ultimately the studio decided to produce a prequel that ideally would give Whitfield time to recover after treatment, but sadly Whitfield relapsed and passed shortly after production of the prequel.

The prequel was called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gods-of-the-Arena/dp/B004HW7JMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gods of the Arena</a>&nbsp;and it was excellent. But there was something missing from Gods that made Blood & Sand the 5-Star series that it was: Andy Whitfield and his Spartacus character. So for season 2 we get Spartacus back, but was Whitfield really replaceable? Starz took a chance and went for the Whitfield look-alike with Liam McIntyre versus finding another imposing force that could also act. Yes, McIntyre does look quite a bit like Whitfield, but there is something just a little less imposing, less rough and less tough about the guy; he's a kinder, warmer Spartacus that smiled too much (and a bit smaller; he had to look up to most of his warrior co-stars). And that took away some of the believability from season 2 for me....Especially when Spartacus would break into one of his many inspirational and emotional speeches to his group of freedom fighters. It was the non-battle scenes that I was often struck by the notion that 'the real' Spartacus is gone.

So was season 2 good? Was it maybe even great? It had some great moments for sure, but had some very big shoes to fill after season 1's finale. Some of the season 2 supporting characters were certainly not as strong as season 1's. The unexpected return of Lucy Lawless definitely helped, but as good as it made the final episode of season 1, I think that the studio was ultimately kicking itself for killing off John Hannah who carried all of Gods of the Arena and co-starred more than he supported many of the Blood and Sand season episodes. (Don't worry: If you're new to the series and you watch the shows in time chronologically with Gods of the Arena first, that tidbit of info about killing off John Hannah is spoiled in the first few moments of episode 1 of Gods even though Hannah stars throughout; so thank the studio for that, not me.)

Similar to its series predecessors, Spartacus Vengeance leaves nothing for the imagination during its time period: love, battle, adultery, orgy, torture, rape, murder...it's all there in all its glory...and I mean ALL its glory. The events of Spartacus Vengeance take place after Spartacus' gang of gladiators escape slavery and form a large rebellion to strike down Roman slavery altogether.

I was still very entertained by Spartacus: Vengeance. I'm a fan, but Andy in my opinion is sorely missed. I think I'll keep watching, and according to a November 7, 2011, Entertainment Weekly article, a third season has been picked up.

Blood and Sand: 5 stars
Gods of the Arena: 4 stars
Vengeance: 3 stars",1333324800,149,3663,5.276157804459691
5053062,3,B0072OFOM6,"What started off as a fairly interesting, entertaining (with depraved overtones) series, quickly sank into a steadily collective mire of impossibility.  There was some strain, I gathered, to try to cash in on the previous, and debatably laudable ""Rome"" series -- still bloody and depraved, no matter how you slice it, (but some of the characters did indeed carry a ghost of ""character"" within them).
Nevertheless, by the end of this latest go round, I desire no more.
The bared testosterone and sullied nymphos throughout were almost addictingly watchable.  But as time wore on, I found there is/was no one really there to barely even ""like,"" other than the cool and stately Spartacus lead, or the ever flash-flooding smile of Gannicus.  I think the writers are sick.

In Spartacus, the sun never shines.  It is eternally wrapped in gray and brown and dirt and grit.  (Not even the Roman's houses are more than dimly colored alleyways, and cheery as a leper ward.)  And blood?  Bless the altars of sacrificial goats and rams, vampires would have had a field day with the leftovers.  Please tell me, in what way was blood spilled?  In trickles, in bruises?  Fool -- it is/was splurged, spewed, spit, chewed, laced, lanced, by the buckets, by the fountains, by the rivers: laved, spurt, splashed, poured, lathered, just all over the place, at almost every opportunity, and in such startling, wondrous Halloween ways... (those making horror films for centuries to come will be scratching their heads on how to overtop this one!).  So I think after this particular series ended, the next season will NOT catch me looking.  I've been bled dry, and soul-shriveled.

And somewhere, I think the true spirit of Spartacus... is writhing.",1333152000,4,1727,4.97212543554007
5053063,5,B0072OFOM6,"I've been a fan of Spartacus since the first episode of the show.  Once you are introduced to the characters in the Ludus you get to see just how deep and fleshed out each character is.  Spartacus goes from a hot headed Thracian, to obedient champion of Capua, to the leader of a renegade group of warriors fierce enough to go against the roman empire.

Andy Whitfield's illness and eventual death put the show on hiatus.  While they were waiting for his recovery they already had Liam McIntyre picked out with Andy's approval to continue on with the show if he was unable.  They also released a prequel to the first season called Gods of the Arena which introduced us to even more characters and further developed the history of the Ludus we see so much of in the first season.  The first seasons were fantastic and this continues the trend.

Andy left some Titan sized shoes to fill but Liam has stepped up so far and delivered a great performance.  So much has changed since the fall of the house of Batiatus and sworn enemies are now true brothers, and visa versa.  Spartacus is now fighting for more than just his own life as he becomes a paragon for the enslaved populace of Rome.

He vows to free all slaves, he vows to fight against Praetor Claudius Glaber, and he vows to have his vengeance.",1332892800,12,1300,4.470338983050848
5053064,5,B0072OFOM6,"I have to start out by saying I might have been one of the most unwilling people to accept the fact that Andy would no longer be Spartacus. Liam definitely had a tough task in front of him. Unfairly to him... i'm sure a lot of fans like me were pretty harsh at the beginning.  He couldn't have handled himself or the situation he was put in any better in my opinion.

All of that said...Liam does an exceptional job and carries the role extremely well.  It's been great to see how all the characters have progressed this season.

The second season is fantastic and I never miss an episode.  I can't wait to see where they go with season 3 and implement Julius Ceasar into the mix!",1332806400,2,680,4.28125
5053065,3,B0072OFOM6,"As someone who literally watches no television, I instantly became addicted to Spartacus, Blood and Sand.  It is easily the very best series I have ever seen.  It was perfectly cast, perfectly written, spell-binding and exciting.  It had a fascinating combination of historical fact, violence, romance, sex, evil, duplicity and debauchery to keep everyone at the edge of their couch.  I literally couldn't wait for the next episode.  If I had one complaint it would be never knowing which beloved character would be killed the following week. A million kudos to DeKnight.  That said, I also enjoyed the prequel; it very nearly measured up, but of course could not minus the incredible Andy Whitfield.  Still it was excellent, albeit too short.
Unfortunately, I am not finding Vengeance as wonderful. Liam is doing his very best, but with all due respect and apologies, he can't fill those sandals.  Andy was a truly perfect Spartacus with the passion, the voice, the look, and the demeanor that you would absolutely expect that character to have. More kudos for casting him.  It comes as no surprise that he can never be adequately replaced, and I find Liam lacking in those areas.  He is too soft-spoken, and when he does speak it sounds more like poetry than fire and determination.  Mira is not really cutting it as a mate for Spartacus; I very much miss the character of Sura, also perfectly cast. Mira is getting clingy and annoying.  Navia is a very weak spot, and to me always was.  I do not like the current Navia, but did not like the original either.  I don't believe either character has/had the passion and strength worthy of a man like Crixus; both lack a personality.  I also agree that the Arena was irreplaceable, and even though the series must move forward toward a different direction, I will forever miss the thrill of the evil Batty and the gladitorial training at his Ludus.  I have been lamenting the death of Whitfield terribly.  Sadly, he can never be replaced.  Gannicus is incredibly appealing and was also very well cast in the prequel; perfect inflections, great passion and expression.  I am thinking he would have made a better Sparty.

He was perfect for this role.  He was awesome. The new guy is doing ok.  If he was the original Spartacus I'm thinking we'd all be saying he's awesome but Andy set such a high bar I don't think anybody could have matched or bettered him.  Anyway.  Season 2 in my opinion is a little different to season 1 for me.  I liked seeing the gladiators being trained, fighting in the area and seeing the twisted plots unfold in the house of Batiatus.  Now that season 2 is out in the open with so many different locatnions it's obviously not the same.  However, season 2 has got better and better with each episode.  Last Fridays.... I think episode 5... was the best episode yet!  I was yelling OMG! and my girlfriend was screaming!!!  really she was.  When Ganacus comes back and enters the arena only to fight against....????? I was shocked!  But there was so many other jaw dropping moments in this episode the 59 minutes(?) just flew by. I was mentally drained.... how often can you say that after watching a show?!  It was like seeing Star Wars in 1977.... you left the theatre thinking 'wow... did I just see what I think I did....no way!' and then you'd talk to everybody you knew about it for weeks and weeks....  well my work colleagues will be getting an ear full tomorrow.  This last episode was that good!

This show continues to amaze me.  Half way through the season and the characters are all in place, the plots are thickening and you know the twists are coming too.

I realized the reason season2 was so good was because of Quintes Batiatus. He's gone now, and the new Spartacus is not fit for the role. Even Crixus has ""dumbed down"" to his level. Physically the new Spartacus doesn't look like he can win against any slave in his entourage. He's just not believable. They even had to change Neavia.

To all those about the athletic thing I ask of you, do you really think that there was a weight lifting regimen in place for gladiators and soldiers back then?

If you are an athelete with an above average build you look for certain things that you would do or could do if given the opportunity.  I know I'm a harsh critic to most, but Andy was not very atheletic, nor was he built like a superior being. If Krixus did not look like such a brute, he could fill half the role.

The death of Mr. Whitfield was a huge loss to the world and to this mini series; one that may not be able to be filled.  I wish the new cast a lot of luck, but it is a near impossible act to follow. Therefore, relatively speaking the first several episodes of the the second season are somewhat disappointing, but I am hoping it will get more interesting as it develops and unfolds into the complete story.",1329350400,11,824,4.5675675675675675

8508985,5,B0072OFOM6,This is an awsome season. Very violent and sexy. Plot is awsome too. Can't believe  someone gave it a bad review.  They must be crazy. This is the best mini series hands down.,1524096000,,175,4.2727272727272725
8508986,5,B0072OFOM6,"My favorite series and some of the best television you will ever watch. Similar to ""300"" (but even better) cinematography, thoughtful intricate story lines, interesting characters, relationships and history with some tasteful but erotic scenes. I watch it over and over. You will want to watch all 4 seasons and on the last episode you'll be sad when there are no more - and then watch the whole thing all over again. It's even great the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time. Enjoy.",1522886400,,467,4.7073170731707314
