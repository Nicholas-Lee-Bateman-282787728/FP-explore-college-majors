8529700,2,B008QOH1DQ,"Poorly recorded.  They are Kinescopes, which means they recorded them by broadcasting the material on a TV.  Then they recorded the TV picture.
But these two shows were recorded with something all over the lens of the recording camera.  It appears to be some sort of dirt or gunk.  Had they cleaned the lens, the picture wouldn't be half bad.  They say they are New Years Specials, but the content makes no reference to the New Year.",1484784000,4,433,4.571428571428571
