I also love the character called, Cook, played by James Hong - extremely funny! The rest of the cast does a wonderful job playing believable Hawaiian/localized folks - just as it really is in Hawai`i. The only small negative note is the actor named Joe Moore, who plays the lead, obviously a young man back then, shows how new he was to acting. Sometimes he over acted a bit, but all in all, he played a believable character worth watching. I would have given this movie a 4 star rating (due to its homemade look at times) but what put it over the top was actor Roland K. Harper, who had no lines but did a great job as just one of the locals in the bar. Check him out in the 'guys checking out stripers' scene. He's the one in front, with black picked-out hair, and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth as he rocks out to the girl's sultry moves. Funny! That alone pushed it to be a 5 star!",1411689600,,1062,4.110576923076923
