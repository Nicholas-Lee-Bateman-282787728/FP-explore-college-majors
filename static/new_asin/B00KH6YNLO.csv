8658814,4,B00KH6YNLO,"I really liked this movie when I saw it for the first time.  Plan on giving it to my Uncle as a gift since he is a big race track fan.  A nice gift
for anyone who likes horses and enjoys the race track.  I personally really like Ralph Meeker as an actor.  The other actors were good in
this movie too.  The story line was really different.  Good ending to the movie!",1517875200,,366,3.9452054794520546

8658817,4,B00KH6YNLO,"A competent version of the Daniel Stein novel, though not as dark and cynical, with the horse-track milieu persuasively presented. Suzanne Pleshette is miscast but Dorothy Provine proves to be in fine form and Ty Hardin gets several chances to take his shirt off. All in all, a satisfying, unpretentious B movie photographed in black-and-white. .",1410220800,,346,5.196428571428571
