8341322,1,B001TH15XY,"Watched about the first ten minutes of this movie and simply could not fathom enduring the next two hours.  It is simply complete gibberish.  Post-war German ""intellectuals"" have gone to great lengths to satirize, mock, deconstruct, and denounce any facet of pre-war German society deemed influential to the rise of the Third Reich.  Invariably the monarchy is a favorite target, although in truth the conservativism of the Wilhelmine period was not so much an antecedent to the rise of the Nazis as leftist would have us believe; indeed they attempted to revolutionize German society into a classless society; among the methods used to try to accomplish this was to reduce German history by means of their own conceptual gibberish.  I'm certainly not one who is against critical and ""artistic"" films that challenge my own assessment of historical periods and events, but when they verge on the absurd or even degenerate--that's another matter.  Full frontal nudity in the first five minutes, dialogue sounding as though spoken by meth-addicted zombies--it simply beyond description.",1301616000,3,1083,5.309941520467836
8341323,5,B001TH15XY,"Unlike the only other three reviewers for this item, I decided I would actually review this film, instead of only complaining about the price of this DVD. I will grant that it is overpriced, but you can find it at a more affordable rate on the amazon marketplace, both used and new. Let's face it folks: we are EXTREMELY lucky that this film was even released on DVD at all! I don't see it becoming a bestseller any time soon. Otherwise you'd have to cross your fingers that some obscure art-house indie theater in a large city may show it a few times. The fact that we can actually access such a gem of a movie on our own terms is a huge boon to English-speaking Syberberg fans everywhere.

This movie is the first part of a trilogy, which is followed by ""Karl May"" (1974) and ""Hitler - ein Film aus Deutschland"" (1977).

Syberberg's ""Ludwig - Requiem Fur einen jungfraulichen Konig"" is a really great film! It's in two parts: the first part is about an hour and a half and the second part about an hour. The first part was really cool, but the second part was sort of a waste of time, in my opinion. One problem is that the movie will probably make little sense to somebody who does not know a lot about Ludwig II, Wagner, German politics of the 19th century, and the rise of National Socialism. Luckily, I know a good amount on those subjects, so the movie was very rewarding - lots of great references. What is really unique about this film is that it is not a traditional film on Ludwig II, but is more of an artistic/poetic exploration into the psyche of Ludwig, which ends up being more powerful then a traditional documentary. After watching it, I felt this romantic nostalgia for Ludwig and what he stood for. There are many great references to him as representing a sort of ""Gotterdammerung"" of old Europe, with the decline of its Kings, city-states, and rural/agrarian feudal/pastoral way of life in the face of creeping modernity. Overall, a pretty cool art film, despite some pretentious flaws usually associated with the sprawling art films of the 70s. If you're interested in this time period and late German Romanticism, I highly recommend this film. I saw ""Ludwig"" having already seen and enjoyed Syberberg's ""Hitler - ein Film aus Deutschland"" and was surprised that I enjoyed ""Ludwig"" just as much, if not more so, as Syberberg's magnum opus, ""Hitler"". If you are somebody who is easily offended by a romanticized view of post-war German culture, this movie is not for you.",1281484800,17,2492,4.61036036036036
8341324,4,B001TH15XY,I saw this film in a theatre and surfed to see if it's available online. I'd love to own it - BUT NOT AT THIS PRICE.,1254700800,2,116,3.5
8341325,3,B001TH15XY,"I never had a chance to see this oddball film and, now that it's on DVD, I still won't. Are these things priced by some disgruntled attorney? A pity, because the film sounds as loopy as Ludwig, and anybody who could build Newschwanstein deserves a big screen. Let's hope the price is a typo and/or saner people put out an affordable version.",1241308800,5,341,4.516129032258065
8341326,5,B001TH15XY,"Five stars assuming it's as good as ""Our Hitler,"" but the price tag on this single disc is a little hefty. I'm surprised Kino wasn't able to nab this and keep it under at least $30. It's not that old a film and I can't imagine it needed a lot of restoration. If someone has an explanation or full story, please add it here--I'm all ears (and I'm well aware of the costs of restoration and ""academic prices"" on DVDs--my old University restored some old East German films and initially released them at $100+ prices, but not to the public). I doubt I'm the first potential customer to look at the price of this movie here and go Jeez!",1239753600,11,632,4.319327731092437
