2495559,4,B000E5KUKG,"we bought them, and now am buying the box set as a gift.  I saw ""Left Behind"" a few years ago, and while the movie obviously did not have the benefit of a large budget like so many Hollywood movies, the cast was good and the message was clear.  It's a very powerful movie, and one that I have heard so many people rave about.  Obviously, people liked it, and bought it, because you can tell with each movie in the series that their budget is bigger.  After I saw the second movie in the set, I thought it was my favorite - until I saw the third.  They each just leave you wanting to see more - just like they should.  Definitely try it out.",1146787200,74,640,4.0396825396825395
2495560,1,B000E5KUKG,"In the quest for family friendly entertainment and film with Biblical themes, there are a lot of well-meaning people who will review these films as 5-star because the Left Behind books have been bestsellers. Now that they are being made into movies they see a big flashing sign screaming ""witnessing opportunity""! There was not enough budget and certainly not enough directorial skill to make this film laudable. The film's production values were undermined by the workmanship of the cameras, the lighting, the editing, and the dubious choices made by the director. All told, the effort was less than professional. When I saw the first movie in the theater, there were cheers at the end of the film. No doubt they were from those who were glad to see a Biblical prophecy and principles brought out as a first run film, without the evils of Hollywood in the way. I understand the sentiment, but fail to understand how many of the viewers could ignore the plainly painful attempts at making this film. The Passion of the Christ, it was not. People say you should not expect these films to be something so epic. Why not? These are best selling books that span 7 years and detail the supernatural events of the tribulation. In today's world, movie goers expect realism. That equals excellence. They either should have put more money into the movie to get better results or waited until they had the proper funds. Show this movie to a non-christian or review this movie as if you were going to see a ""secular"" movie. If the film is not realistic enough and wasn't put together with excellence, even if the gospel is presented beautifully, you are preaching to the choir. I will give these films one ounce of credit. Most of the actors they picked look exactly like I envisioned most of the characters and the airplane scene when people disappear is moving. Besides that the movie is quickly put together, low budget, bad acting, the 2nd movie is boring, and while the 3rd movie is 10 times better than the first two, it doesn't follow the book AT ALL. Except for using the names of the characters. It was obvious before even making a good movie, the agenda of getting the gospel message into the movie was put first. Do you want to watch a truly well made Christian, than yes, go watch Passion or Nativity.",1144108800,22,2301,4.669950738916256

2495722,5,B000E5KUKG,"I've seen some reviews stating that this movie isn't accurate or some stating other negative thoughts.  Only speaking for myself, I enjoyed this movie series.  I know my Bible and know things in movies are added on to create a more interesting story, that's what draws people to what movies.  I do not believe that anyone really knows ""exactly"" how this whole event will take place so to judge the events isn't fair to the producers who at least are making Christian movies.  In the end we, who are true believers, will be taken up to meet the Lord in the air and the rest of the story shouldn't concern us except to pray for our family, friends and neighbor's salvation.  So lighten up and enjoy the movie series.",1507507200,,714,4.503875968992248

2495843,3,B000E5KUKG,Really good series/movies with the exception of the pre-tribulaition rapture.  There is no biblical proof of it.  Sorry no offense to those who believe it.  Other then that seems pretty solid with the book of Revelation. Those who believe are in for a big sad surprise.  There is no 2 verses to back it up.  Don't read verses out of context.  Just read the verses.  We WILL face tribulation. Those who are prepared will be spared.  Make sure your lamp has oil.,1488499200,,460,4.524390243902439

2495845,5,B000E5KUKG,I was looking for a Biblical movie to show my family and friends who probably would not want to sit and study the Bible. Was looking for good biblical foundation and troops. This movie delivered both. Children can watch this movie and not be terrified. Thoroughly enjoyed it. A little cheesy at times but due to budget constraints. Very well done. Happy with it,1487635200,,361,4.65625

If they're going to do a set of books to movies, they should at least plan to go all the way through. Or at the very least do the few movies they do finishing thru the end not the middle.

2495875,5,B000E5KUKG,"It's a great idea of what things could be like when the rapture finally happens. Reading the bible gives us the real expectation and idea, but unfortunately people don't read it enough or understand it all. But that's ok, we are not to understand it all just to trust our Lord Jesus and believe He will save us from the wrath to come. We are to be watching and standing fast in our faith and looking up, because our redemption is drawing near. In the meantime we are to be discipling people and warning them of whats coming if you reject Jesus as your Lord and Savior. The Bible is truth and has all the answers for how we should be living. And Jesus is the only way to heaven, He even told us that. ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."" (John 14:6)",1484092800,8,798,4.15483870967742

2495985,1,B000E5KUKG,"Tim Lahaye is an evil man, though many don't realize it or believe it - nor do they want to. How do I know this? I'll make a point-blank statement regarding his book, Left Behind. Read the following books in the Bible and you will see why I ""want to be left behind"". Daniel, then Revelation, and the four Gospels where Jesus tells us through parables that the wicked are taken away first. Read I & II Thessalonians, I & II Peter. Cross reference the scriptures and chase down each mention in the Bible about the 2nd coming of Christ. I WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND!",1467763200,,559,4.283018867924528
2495986,3,B000E5KUKG,"Jesus said: Joh 12:48  He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
So what did Jesus say? Mat 24:29  Immediately after the tribulation 
Mat 24:30  they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds
Mat 24:31  And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect(church)
Jesus said he comes after the tribulation to gather his church but these bozos claim the rapture comes before the tribulation.
  If you want to watch these films to gain truth, GO ELSEWHERE AS THEY ARE BLIND LEADERS OF THE BLIND. If you are looking to have a little fun and don't care if it is true, watch these.
  As a follower of Jesus Christ I know we are supposed to know when Jesus is coming back, not some so-called secret coming.. Here is the verse that says so. 1Th 5:4  But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
Here is another: Mat 13:10  And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
Mat 13:11  He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you(followers) to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
  I am fed up with liars who don't know the 2nd coming IS THE RAPTURE COMING. There is no vhance to come to Christ later. That is what Satan would have you believe.",1467504000,,1424,4.245353159851301

This video, better, perhaps than the book, will get your attention, and order up a big slice of 'Get to know your God.'  We all have the gift of 'Choice,' but this video tends to promote that there truly is only one answer in that choice, and the other is condemnation in that choice,  Watch the video, and see which choice you want to make, for God's sake, and especially, yours.

2496225,1,B000E5KUKG,"Christian's deserve something better than this drivel concerning their 'end time' beliefs.  In fact these 3 Left Behind movies are so bad that they make the Nicolas Cage version seem like a cinematic masterpiece by comparison !
The acting is just terrible !  I don't know who's worse, the chick playing the daughter of the airplane pilot who's so irritating you just want to strangle her, or the truly awful Kirk Cameron - an actor so bad that he would've failed an audition for an Edward d. Wood Jr movie !
Their childish romance sinks the whole storyline into the depths of pure tedium - who on earth starts a romance anyway when they know that not only are they living during the reign of the Antichrist, but that God Himself is about to pour His wrath upon the earth and millions of people are going to die - get your priorities straight why don't you !
Cameron's conversion scene has got to be the most unconvincing Christian conversion ever put onto film - if you want to see it done right watch Walton Goggins at the end of Robert Duvall's The Apostle movie.  Cameron merely says he's sorry to God for having not bothered praying to Him before followed by some terrible pop song and hey presto, he's a Christian - what  kind of a conversion is that !  No mention whatsoever of him actually accepting Jesus as his Lord and Saviour who died for his sins, I thought these movies were made by Christian's ?  If that's how they think a person truly comes to Christ they're sadly mistaken !
The scenes set in Jerusalem in the 2nd movie have so obviously been filmed in some studio with a whole bunch of white looking actors with towels on their heads trying to pass themselves off as Arabs.  Even worse, the guy playing the Antichrist, with his seriously dodgy European accent which is even worse than Tim Curry's in Congo and at times sounds part Klingon, comes across as less scary than a Scooby Doo villain !  This is supposed to be a representation of pure evil, not a joke !
 Sam Neill's portrayal of the Antichrist in The Omen 3: The Final Conflict, may have been biblically baseless but at least it had power - who can forget the chilling scene were he addresses his many followers.
I take no pleasure in saying this but there's just nothing to recommend here.
The worse crime of all though has to be that these movies become less and less faithful to the books on which they're based, which has got to be the ultimate insult.
In fact these 3 movies are just so bad that Christian's everywhere ought to sue the filmakers for portraying their faith in such a shoddy, amateurish and monotonous way.",1431648000,,2604,4.476793248945148

Kurt Cameron does a wonderful job as Buck, a reporter who is left behind and is on a quest to find out how exactly millions of people and all small children on earth vanished at the same time.

2496299,5,B000E5KUKG,"Excellent. Praise the Lord that Kirk Cameron has boldly promoted God through his acting talent. It's a shame this movie didn't get much attention when it was produced (although, no wonder, as we've been living in what's slowly become an increasingly anti-Christian society). I think the AC could arise through some place like the U.N.; for sure, he arises during the Tribulation and seemingly out of nowhere. People will be deluded (by God) into thinking he's the answer to our problems but during the mid-Trib all newly born again believers like Buck (Kirk Cameron) will see the truth, if they haven't, already. This movie does a great job of illustrating what A Thief in the Night did: that going through the motions of church attendance, religious rituals, prayers or whatever does NOT mean a person is saved. In both movies, even pastors got left behind if their heart and life did not match their professed beliefs. These movies accurately portray what being born again means. More must see evangelistic material, especially for impressionable youth.",1425600000,5,1055,5.068965517241379

2496498,4,B000E5KUKG,"So this obviously was not a multimillion dollar production, but I have to say our whole family was pleasantly surprised how closely these movies followed the book series (unlike the new movie in theatres 2014). We bought the entire series at a discount and watched them in one weekend. From a Christian standpoint, it was interesting to see how this played out without coming across too supernatural and still being scripture based. I think this series does an awesome job at giving us an IDEA of what those times will be like, and most of all, to make sure we are ready!",1415059200,3,571,4.607843137254902

I read an entire book in a day and a half, what I should not have done is order `1 or 2 at a time because waiting for the mail to bring more books was like waitng for santa when I was 6 years old.",1414022400,,299,3.6875
2496503,5,B000E5KUKG,"Love this presentation of the series. I saw it first at a home church meeting, then purchased for my home library & have seen it with my husband at my home. I think it goes a long way in appropriately presenting some major issues we all struggle with. In this media saturated world it is so easy to drift from the teachings of Christ & this is a great little jolt reminder to be vigilant of the way we treat our spouse. I love this movie & highly recommend it.",1413936000,,460,4.122222222222222

2496523,3,B000E5KUKG,"I would of gladly of given this series a five star except for one thing it did not follow suit with the other two or I should say the book when they made World at War and that lost my interest and was disappointed. I did read the series and the first  two was right on the money and would of been really great if the other followed suit even if they had to make another one or two or possibly more just to keep the series the same and I really enjoyed reading the series I am on Kingdom Come at the moment and I don't believe it is in the series, but has the same characters plus a few more I am sure lol, and would give the series in the books that was written a five star. I even held out on watching the last one knowing it was the same although I believe it does say something to the effect that it would be different. The new movie with Nicolas Cage came out over the weekend and i don't know how that one turned out, but looking for it to come in my area or if I have to drive down to Palm Springs I will just because I would like to see it even if I believe Nicolas Cage would of been a better Antichrist instead of Raymond Steel, who knows just will have to wait and see Nicolas Cage is a great actor.",1412640000,,1209,3.855421686746988

2496588,5,B000E5KUKG,"All of what has happened in the past, can we learn from it? These films ask, over and over the same question and then try to show us the paths to follow to try to prevent the end yet humanity with all it's greed and all of it's envy continues on the wrong road as it has so many times in the past. We do not learn from our mistakes no matter how many times we are given the opportunity's or shown the way. How scary is it that theses films mirror the paths of our Nation, and all the Freedoms we are being asked to give up! The example of UN and unification one world order? A repeat of the past from Germany only now we have the UN? So yes I recommend these be watched very carefully, and if necessary watch again and when you do remember your true history,(if you have to go to your home town library and pick up real books and read), about what really happened in our history, about the puritans, the Mormons and our forefathers, the real reason that they came to this land to have religious freedom, and also to have the right to have a voice in their Government and how they were taxed, no more persecution, no more kings or systems from which they could not lift themselves from,(in all of Europe whatever station you were born into you lived and died in). This film shows how weak minded people are manipulated, by being told that they will be taken care of, in all aspects of by the World Order, when in fact, they are being weeded out by the wealthy, healthy, and the ones that will benefit the New World Order all else will perish.",1406160000,,1541,4.191919191919192

Good story line, good acting, just typical in the low budget film making.  I've passed it around at my church (the whole series actually) and most of them felt pretty much the same way, it was worth watching.  Don't know if I'd buy it again just for me to watch, but the fact that others got enjoyment out of it made it worth it.",1404691200,,457,4.159090909090909

Sadly this three part series only declines in quality with each part.  Good actors, good story, good truths, only the movies just can't pull it off.

2496688,5,B000E5KUKG,This was a great film series that presents the all important message of the gospel as well as the rapture event that our generation will see in their lifetime.

2496691,1,B000E5KUKG,"I would caution Christians to be very careful when dealing with the subject of Rapture as the word Rapture is not written anywhere in our Fathers word.  Some of the support comes from snippets of biblical text which ignore the subject and object (context and meaning) of the entire chapter or verse.

This work does not present both sides of the issue for the reader to consider and never mentions that the postulation of Rapture originated in the 1830s in Port Glastonbury Scotland, through a young women who had been very ill for some time.  The young woman's name was Margaret Macdonald.  Two priests (Irving and Darby) were called in to witness the events rested to her illness which included levitating off the floor and ranting about biblical text and its interpretation as Rapture.  Christians should never be in the dark concerning where end time postulations originate from.  The events of Ms. Macdonald are well recorded in local church history and a periodical called ""The Morning Star"".  There is a work called ""The rapture plot"" which bears out the details of These two priests, Ms Macdonald and others and how they influenced this thing called rapture.

Not to shine any negative light upon Kurk but this works basis is very questionable at best, so Christians are warned to do their homework and fully document the claims and match them to the sequence and order of events defined in the book of Daniel 7 - 11 and its companion work, the book of Revelation, as well as the signs of the end given by Christ to the Apostles (Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21).  Finally there are the prophecies of the prophets both major and minor and their sequence and order which are very important related to discerning the truth related to the claims given in this ""Left Behind"" series.  Don't simply assume its correct, validate its claims in the word of our Father.

Kurk does have an excellent documentary on the early forefathers of America called ""Monumental"" which is well written and documented and should be watched by most Americans, as it sets down the truth concerning the forefathers of these United States.",1391904000,4,2120,4.7967032967032965

The movie is scary and compelling at the same time.

I love the 1st and second dvd. The 3rd dvd was okay, but it doesn't have the same effect as the first two.

2496849,5,B000E5KUKG,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I hate to compare films to their literary counterparts. It's difficult, even unfair sometimes but it's awfully hard not to especially if the books are phenomenal successes or classics or even just a book that is one of your personal favorites. For me...the Left Behind Series of books (12 of them in total) were drop dead amazing. I was riveted for the year it took me to read them. I am now a huge fan of the series and I couldn't help but see the films. I had a lot to go on being such a fan of the books but I also know that the books AND the films are not for everyone!!! First of all..non Christians are going to be overtly critical, especially if they go into it expected a science fiction, End Of Days type movie event. This film is based on something that millions BELIEVE is truth so you have to take that into consideration. First of all for me personally I was blown away by Left Behind.

Director Vic Sarin is no stranger to film making. He has worked in films for the last 4 decades at least. He has done pretty much everything so he is definitely a veteran film maker. I don't know if he had any contact with the original book by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye but his casting choices were dead on for the most part and I stand by that. Kirk Cameron is the exception but I won't say he's bad. In fact he's quite good in the lead role of Cameron ""Buck"" Williams. Granted he's not quite as gritty, or street smart as his book counterpart but he's decent and considering that Cameron is more than directly responsible for the creation of this film at all. Relative newcomer Janaya Stephens plays a strong headed and take charge Chloe Steele and does a good job. The real brilliant casting is in the role of leading man Captain Rayford Steele who was such a huge hero in the book. Brad Johnson puts a face to that role and does a great job doing that. I don't even credit his acting necessarily but his look nails Rayford's personality and his acting is alright too. The other person is the anti-Christ himself Nicolae Carpathia played by Gordon Currie, a character actor who's been around for a long time. He is brilliant as both the charismatic caring leader and the dark, evil being he is to become.

The story is very closely linked to the book and they did a good job of transferring book to screen and leaving the most important details in tact and only changing small details. I have heard complaints about this not being an original concept with typical government conspiracy and hit men and yadda yadda yadda well...first off NEWSFLASH nothing is an original concept anymore, it doesn't stop people from seeing it. In fact it seems that more than half the films released now are not only not original but direct rehashes of original films or series. I happen to think Left Behind: The Movie puts a new spin on the Christian theory and does it excellently. The budget is low but still managed to pull off some intense action scenes, there are definite moments when the acting borderlines on campy but they are all not mainstream big actors and actresses and they do their best to make it real. The plot is actually quite complex and intriguing when you really watch. The whole concept of the anti-Christ killing his parents which was brought up in films like The Omen and End Of Days is changed completely to have Carpathia murdering his parent ""figures"", the men who created him politically. The final scene in the film is disturbing and memorable with a powerful performance by both Cameron and Currie.

The average person I can understand giving this a poor score...I could even understand someone being bored with it. It has it's moments. I think for me it's just a personal thing that I loved it and I loved the books and I hope they continue making the films. What I don't like is people nit picking it and saying how crappy it is simply because of it's basis in Christian faith. Grow up!! and open your mind, even if you don't believe it, you might be entertained. It's worth seeing and I know it's a cult classic so I'm not the the only one!! 8.5/10 (For most probably a 5/10 but I still encourage reading the book and watching the movie...it's got a lot to offer)",1371945600,,4230,4.447164948453608

2496967,4,B000E5KUKG,"I am a huge fan of the Left Behind books. They are masterful, easily my favorite books of all time. I agree with the basic theology presented, and I find the characters, plot, and general themes very interesting and engaging. After reading the books like a madman, getting through one on average about every 4-5 days, I received the movies for Christmas. I had mixed expectations for several reasons, the chief of which was just what I had heard about the movies, that they were okay, but nothing special. I'll now present a triple review for the triple pack of movies.

Left Behind: The Movie - 2000
In my opinion, a Left Behind movie could be something fantastic, a great outreach to unbelievers, especially since movies tend to be more widespread in their attraction than books, which nowadays are more a niche thing anyway. However, this first LB movie falls a bit short in multiple places. I'll start with the bad and work my way up to the good. This movie is way too short. 90 minutes is NOT enough runtime for a movie as epic as a movie based of the book has the potential to be. I realize that basing a movie off of a book has it's quirks and limitations, because vastly more content is contained in a book than in a movie. But I felt like they changed and compressed too much about this movie. If you've read the books, you know that things take a while to unfold after the Rapture. You have several chapters where Rayford is sitting at home worried sick about Chloe and Hattie among others. In the movie everybody shows up right at the same time, there's very little mourning compared to the books, etc. I really felt like they could have made this movie 2 hours and a 2 and a half hours and it would have been much more engaging. It really felt to me like it was just a highlight reel of the books, with all the absolute most important characters getting some screen time, and other characters that were only slightly less important in the books are totally ignored. Case in point: Steve Plank. In the books he was a prime character, Buck's closest friend and mentor. Not here at all. Not even a mention of his name. They also compressed a lot of story elements, such as how Hattie came to be involved with Nicolae. Another aspect is the drama that takes place after Rayford and Hattie's plane has landed at O'Hare. It doesn't seem like there's enough craziness compared to the books. And the fact that during that sequence the primary focus of attention is a little dog whose owner apparently got raptured is just a disservice to the books. The special effects, while few, are not very well done. But considering that this is an independent Christian film, that's really to be expected, and I think that the lack of ability to pull off Star Wars/Lord of the Rings-esque SFX also contributed to why the film was so short, because a lot of scenes in the books really would require a rather large budget and advanced special effects. The final qualm I have with this first film is the lack of a true Gospel presentation. In the books it is made clear on multiple occasions the Gospel story and how one can be saved from their sins. In this movie they hint around at it, and maybe mention the name of God once, never mentioning Jesus. I find that upsetting because I think this film could be a really good outreach tool, if there was a good Gospel presentation. Now on to the good. I felt like the acting was really quite good, and the casting was well done as well. Kirk Cameron is, well, Kirk Cameron. He's Christian acting's poster boy, and he really stands out in this movie as Buck. Clarence Gilyard was superb as Bruce Barnes, though in the book he was described a plump, kind of nerdy guy who wore glasses and had short curly hair. Clarence Gilyard is almost the exact opposite of that, if you know what I mean, but still he did a marvelous job. Brad Johnson as Rayford Steele does a good, if underrated job. He really is able to convey the emotions his character is described as having in the books. Janaya Stephens as Chloe does a decent job, but I feel like she's not quite up to par with the rest of the cast. She is also described as being a cute blonde, where as Stephens is a cute brunette. Chelsea Noble Cameron (Kirk's wife) is really good as Hattie. In the books she is described as one of those stunner type women, who every guy goes nuts about. Chelsea Noble fits that bill perfectly, and is about as close to how I imagined Hattie in the books as one can get. Gordon Currie as Nicolae Carpathia does fantastically, and his Russian-Romanian accent is done really well. He's not really described as being short and wiry in the books, he is described as being tall and muscular, with a build like that of an Olympic swimmer. Regardless, the acting and casting in this film really save it from total demise. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.

Left Behind II: Tribulation Force - 2002
The second installment in the LB movie series is about on par with the first. The entire cast from the first movie returns to reprise their roles from the first. I'm afraid though that this one also suffers from the same troubles as the first, just more pronounced. They stray from the story even more, and add and change and mix and combine more things than I thought was necessary. This movie has the appearance of the two witnesses, which were two of my favorite characters from the books. I felt like they made them too stereotypical, like, they just look like how everyone assumed Moses and Elijah would look (something like high priests), whereas in the books they're described as being rather minimalist in dress, not elaborate or fancy. I think in terms of acting, Janaya Stephens has a marked improvement from the first movie. She is much mature acting, and I think she really captures the Chloe from the books. The other thing I thought they nailed nearly perfectly was the scene in which Chloe is mad at Buck, and Buck waits on the porch of her house, and they have a fight, and then finally make up. It was done really well, and Kirk's and Janaya's acting skill is at its best right here. I feel like they also captured Nicolae's Satan-driven rage in the scene where Ben-Judah declares that Jesus, not Nicolae, is the Messiah. Once again, however, this movie falls a bit short because of 1) the rather cheesy special effects and 2) the 90 minute running time. They do, however, present a clear gospel story on two occasions, which is a big plus for me. There was one glaring detour from the story that I found absolutely hideous, and that is the appearance of what is assumed to be an angel when Buck and Ben-Judah are trying to get to the witnesses. She begins singing Amazing Grace, of all things, and somehow is able to distract the guards so that Buck and Tsion can get through. That is not at ALL how it happens in the book, and this movie would have greatly benefited if her scenes were just cut altogether. All in all, this movie improves a on a couple fronts, but not enough to make it a real standout. 4 of 5.

Left Behind: World At War - 2004
This movie deviates so thoroughly from the books, it's almost impossible to make any realistic comparisons. It's loosely based on the last 2 or 3 chapters of Trib Force, but they take the creative license through the roof. However, that is easily overlooked because of how much better this movie is made. The cinematography is superb, easily equal with the Bourne Supremacy released that same year. The special effects, explosions and what not, are excellent, especially in comparison with the other two LB movies. The focus in on the president of the U.S. who is nothing like he is in the books. In the movie he becomes a believer, and helps out the Trib Force, whereas in the books he uses obscenities every other sentence, is a total warmonger, and died unceremoniously in the Wrath of the Lamb earthquake. I think the rebellious nature, and the hatred for Carpathia that the president has is accurately portrayed, though once again they play a character that is explicitly described as being white in the books with a black actor. This doesn't bother except for the fact that it's not accurate with the books. Lou Gossett does a superb job as President Fitzhugh, and really makes this movie enjoyable with his ability to convey deep emotion and turmoil over the state of his country and the entire world. All the characters from the previous two movies return, with one glaring exception: Clarence Gilyard no longer plays Bruce. He was replaced by a younger actor, who doesn't do badly, but he is absolutely no Clarence Gilyard. That really made me sad, because he grew to be one of my favorite characters in the first two movies. Janaya Stephens one-ups herself from the previous movie again, as does almost everybody else. One thing I didn't really like was the totally abrupt introduction of Rayford's new wife Amanda at the double wedding ceremony with Rayford and Amanda, and Buck and Chloe. In the books she came on the scene long before the wedding. Overall, this movie is excellent, and really redeems this series. The end really sets you up for a 4th movie, but after eight years we still haven't gotten one. It's a shame, because these movies really on the rise in terms of quality, and I think they would have only grossed more and more at the box office had they continued. I give this third installment 4 1/2 of 5 stars.

As a set of movies, I think had these been done by the Kendrick Brothers and Sherwood Pictures, they would have been absolutely awesome. But I think these three really paved the way for Sherwood to be able to compete with Hollywood with good Christian films. It is a dream of mine, as an aspiring filmmaker, to maybe someday do some remakes of these movies in collaboration with Sherwood, but until then, these movies will quench your thirst for Left Behind action on the big screen.",1357171200,,9891,4.514779698828779

Of course it leaves the judgements out but it gives you insight. It reminds you that you do not want to be left behind and it encourages you to keep your eyes where they should be. I have showed this vedio to my firends. Hoping to help them see before its too late. It gets the conversation started that's for sure.,1326412800,,473,3.9375

It was obviously a lower-budget independent film: the acting was sub-par, the script varied from the original, the special effects weren't very ""special"", etc. However - the message of this movie is SO important - if you have loved ones who won't sit down and read the Tim LaHaye book series, this movie will definitely hit home. In fact, I know people who watched the film that were then inspired to want to know more and read the books.

The Amazon.com price surpasses any other seller I've seen online. It was great to get the whole box set as we anticipate the remake of this series later this year - I just hope they spend a little more on the next one!",1325462400,,770,4.384615384615385

If you have heard about  Armaggedon from a friend or have read it yourself,this is the series to have. It is great for those who read the Bible ,and those who don't,both  can sit together and  enjoy . It both teaches and makes for a very entertaining movie. It is very rare that you find a series that can appeal to both the Christian and non Christian alike.

Even those who profess to be Agnostic found it to be a very enjoyable story. I wouldn't be surprized if some of those who may be not believers saw it. Even though they do not believe it still gives them something to think about.

I hope that everyone out there gets this movie. Or perhaps read the books first. However your choice,you will find it both entertaining and a powerful testament on were we are headed and the final out come.",1319673600,,959,4.247252747252747

2497152,1,B000E5KUKG,"My husband and I are truck drivers and listen to audiobooks all the time.  We listened to the Left Behind series read by Jack Sondricker and loved them. He has specific voices for each character...just brings the stories to life!!

When the Left Behind movie came out, I couldn't purchase it fast enough!!  The audiobooks were so good that I just knew the movie would be wonderful!  Boy was I wrong!  Within the first 1/2 hour, I knew I was going to be very disappointed!  The whole movie was rushed....jamming I don't know how many of the books together...things in the movie that never should have been there...Buck never went to the house with Ray...what the heck?

When the second movie came out, I gave them one more chance.  By the middle of that movie, I was sorry I every bought them!  I gave them to my nephew who is Wiccin and was wanting Christian movies to watch.

The movies are probably very good if you have never read the books, but if you have already read (or listened) to the books, leave the movies alone...you will just be very disappointed!

I know that movies have to be shortened in order to get everything in, but COME ON! Really?  They couldn't have made more sequels....we have a ton of Halloween sequels that show nothing but massive violence, but they couldn't bother to make sequels to movies that have an actual message?

It's been over 5 years since I saw the first one, but I still won't watch them again.  The books got you involved with the characters and brings prophecy and the end times to life...it made me want to learn more about the rapture and what is going to happen to non-Christians that will be left behind.  The movies....just too rushed, like they couldn't get everything said fast enough.

Once again, if you have NOT read the books, then DEFINITELY get the movies...THEN if you want the ENTIRE story of what Ray, Chloe, Buck, Hattie and Bruce go through, read the books...in fact, I HIGHLY recommend LISTENING to the books.  But if you HAVE read the books, just don't bother with the movies!",1316131200,22,2042,4.565934065934066
2497153,4,B000E5KUKG,"I bought this 3 movie set and am glad I did as the price for the set was much cheaper than any where else I looked.
 I enjoyed the movies, but then I liked the books.  The special effects are good, the acting is good, and they move along well.  That said, they do deviate from the books quite a bit...nothing new for movie makers there.  I felt the first one followed the book the best. Still the message is there and for Christian movies the production and acting are excellent.
If you don't like movies based on Christian fiction or even non-fiction don't get these.  It's that simple.  I've never understood why people feel obligated to criticize something they knew they wouldn't like or disagreed with in the first place.  These are supposed to be a reviews of movies not a philosophical debate.",1314230400,,800,4.513888888888889

Also in the book the character Chloe seems so much more mature, in the movie I feel she came off a bit whiney and immature. Also we have no idea who Amanda (rayfords wife after rapture) is the movie they just plop her into the scene and it goes from there, also we have no idea why Verna (Bucks boss) was so rude to him in the movie but the book explains. I wish that I had read the books first to make up for what the movie left out but I am enjoying reading them now.",1306108800,,638,3.7333333333333334

Well with the gruesomeness of that movie, This one provides you with everything that you could ever desire in a movie...Every genre is available- from horror to romance it is there.
It alike passion of the Christ could be seen as a life changing movie, It carries the capability of impacting on someone's life drastically. It creates a moment of reminiscing for individuals who watch it. After watching it you are obligated to sit back and think about the various aspects of each of the dvds and the lessons it provides. Then you proceed to question yourself.
I received this movie in an excellent condition and the visual graphics were also of an outstanding view.

2497182,1,B000E5KUKG,"I should say I never made it to World at War, I watched the first two movies, and I had to take several breaks, to calm down and just breathe. The movies are filled with acting that Beastmaster would be embarrassed by. The plot I realize is based on a vague biblical prophecy, but apparently it's so vague that what I came away with from it was that I would be left behind. I could say this movie panders to fear, and the lowest common denominator of Christianity, but alas it is a large group of people that find this kind of fear propaganda entertaining. I will admit that I'm writing this in response to these working as movies, not really anything else, and as movies they were not even TV quality. I can't believe the scenes they left in were the best ones, they must of had some very scary takes. I just did not enjoy them on any level, I couldn't even laugh at how bad they were, they were just too clunky and the whole time attempting to have a deeper more complicated message, while at the same time Kirk runs around just telling people how they should start praying, even though there is no point at all. It's like watching a movie about rats in a box where the air is running out, and instead of drawing straws to see who gets to be eaten first, they just all lay down and give up.  I mean once you figure out there is nothing they can do, the thrill and the drama dissipate, because the acting alone can't carry this.",1300492800,8,1429,4.2344322344322345

2497184,5,B000E5KUKG,"I knew what I was buying when I bought it.  I have read all of the 16 or so Left Behind Book series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins and wanted to see the movies.  The movies, (although a lot is left out from what the books can provide, obviously,) were true to the books and done wonderfully so that with some exception, the whole family can watch and learn about 'end times' in a way that isn't too frightening but yet, educational and pretty true to the writer's educated interpretation of the Bible's account.  Kirk Cameron is the lead character, Buck Williams, a journalist who is propelled into an end times thriller together with his chosen circle of friends, he negotiates meaning and attempts to predict the next phase of this particular time frame.  He further begins a war with the anti-Christ with some edge of your seat guessing what will happen next.  A good three movies where one will take over where the last one left off.  I recommend that parents watch it first to determine if it is appropriate viewing for their particular children only so that sensitive children are not frightened and those too young will not be able to understand the message anyway.",1297987200,3,1173,4.615384615384615

Rapture:
1 : an expression or manifestation of ecstasy or passion

Oh, how wonderful the world would be without all those pesky-preachies. This movies confirms the dream of many that some day we could set archaic religion aside and just live our lives.

Kirk Cameron has time to sit in a bar and drink beer.  A father has time to spend time with his daughter after his church-obsessed wife evaporates.  With the exception of  some car bombs and black-clad baddies this movie makes me wish that the rapture really existed.

2497308,3,B000E5KUKG,"I purchased the Left Behind video collection to view with my 6th grade Sunday School class after our discussion of the end times and the book of Revelation.  I watched the series in one viewing before showing it to my class to be more comfortable with the actual content of the movies.
I thought that the acting was done well by some unknown actors (outside of Kirk Cameron), and the story line kept my interest and the movie as a whole moved quickly.  However, I felt that Hollywood sensationalized what the end times will be like and this needs to be explained to people who don't have a deep understanding of Scripture.  Saying that, I wouldn't tell people not to watch the series or not to read the Left Behind books, but, I would caution people from attempting to over-spiritualizing the content from the movie.
I would recommend this series to people who are looking for a ""clean"" action movie that has serious undertones.  It was a extremely intriguing on that note and I enjoyed it from that point of view.  However, I must qualify this statement by saying that from the point of view of a Theologian and Pastor I was disappointed in the sensationalism.  But if it wasn't sensationalized, nobody would have watched it.
In closing, I recommend that people watch this series with caution and remember that it is just a movie.  Enjoy it and if you have questions ask your Pastor.",1265414400,5,1384,4.624489795918367

Another idea is Final Events, which is more encompassing, its not a drama, but a docudrama with a wider range of compelling facts and news reports of the Antichrist and the false god.  Good for showing none-believers!

2497379,5,B000E5KUKG,"Whether you believe in God or not, these 3 dvd's are so close to what the bible has to say about the very days we are living in and what to expect.

If you are not a Christian, then I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend buying at least the first 2 videos. ""Left Behind"" and ""Left Behind II - Trublation force""

This movie will help prepare what is very close to coming! The rapture of those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ. These are exceptionally well made videos, very active and informative.

Also, lets say if and when this ""rapture"" does happen - then these videos are the first that we are recommending to anyone who happens to be left behind, to go through the upcoming 7 year peace convenant with Israel, which begins the 7 year tribluation period and the New World Order (sound familiar?)

With the current world events going on today, and watching bible prohphecy being fullfilled before our very eyes, there is no way I could ever view this as a fictional. This is a NON FICTION truth, that I think every person in the world should have either the book and / or the DVD's.

I had seen the first movie, ""Left Behind"" years before and enjoyed it, although it did leave you hanging. I purchased the books and read them and at the same time purchased the 3 DVD's. I just finished watching all 3 movies. I was disappointed. The script somewhat followed the books, but then by World at War, it went off into its own world. The characters I grew to love in the books were almost one-dimensional in the movie. If you watch the special features you will see interviews with various celebrities about the movie. I wish they had made more of the story into the movie. Janaya (""Chloe"") mentioned how long everything took, but I was surprised, and had to reverse it to hear it again, to learn that it was only 6 weeks of filming. After seeing the 95 minute features I can believe it. This had so much potential, but dropped the ball. Although I must say, the actors were terrific! Everyone matched the descriptions and personalities in the books. Gordon Currie was incredible as the Antichrist! I caution you to read the books first, then watch the movies. If not, you will not appreciate the deeper meaning to them. You don't even need to be religious really, just appreciate the remarkable insights.

2497419,2,B000E5KUKG,"LEFT Behind was an excellent well written book, the movie series was not.

The first film, opens with one might say the cheesiest special effects since the 1960s war films.
Directed by Vic Sarin, a Canadian Moslem, the acting seems right out of LIFETIME original movie, with exception of Kirk Cameron.

But most disturbing at all, Left Behind essentially a Christian ficition film with no mention of the name of Jesus? Or much mention of Christanity. Only the vague God and some type of Heaven is mentioned, but never really explained.

I challenge anyone to spot the name of Jesus in this film. It just isn't there.

Despite this, the LEFT BEHIND was decent, with a lot of effort from Kirk Cameron, and the intense scenarios of the books to rely on.

The second two sequels films are more B movie terroritory, (They actually mention Jesus so this is an improvement) so if you like that then buy them. I would suggest rent this movie at your local Family Video store.  It is not worth the sell.",1234224000,6,994,4.5875706214689265

2497461,2,B000E5KUKG,"I had read about amazing popularity of the ""Left Behind"" series, so I decided to check it out out of curiosity. I hope the books make more sense than the movies, because even leaving the evangelical aspects of the story out of it, the story makes very little sense.

There are so many holes in the plot and they are so large that it seems like no one actually read the script. Also, I am not sure how you can make a movie about the end of the world seem to drag, but they manage to, having many scenes that have no importance drag on and on, while the parts of the movies that examine what is going on are quickly glossed over. The production values do not help much either, with the battle scenes being cheap computer graphics (that almost look like a computer game), and the live action often looking like a lifetime movie.

The story itself is not bad. If it had just been written/edited a bit more carefully and a little more money spent in the production it would have been much more satisfying.
As far as the religious content is concerned, I can't really be a competent judge as I am not an expert, but there are some things I found confusing. For example when all the believers are taken up, somehow all the children went as well. It was my understanding that if you were not baptized a Christian then you would not be able to be saved, and certainly many secular and Jewish (and maybe even Catholic according to some) children would be left behind. Also given the fact that there are relatively few Christians in Asia (which is most of population of the world), you would think that that would be noticed.

So I ordered this box set to make my Left Behind DVD collection complete, as the Japanese edition of the first movie I had bought, which is disguised under the translated title 'Human Vanishings', was lost when I lent it to a friend. I was surprised to see the third one was distributed by Sony Pictures, which tells how far the series has come in terms of recognition.
There was the problem of the World at War disc being an RCE, and did not play on my region free player which I bought especially to view this box set! But more of the problem was the storyline of World at War. I called these movies an 'adaptation' of the famous novels, and it seems the film-makers seemed to take a lot of 'creative freedom' in adapting the story, greatly expanding the character of the President Fitzgerald, who is not very prominent in the books. Why? The books were OK as they are, despite having many scenes of long sermons, which were necessary, and worked well in book form, but would bring the pace of a 90 minute movie way down. It seems the film-makers had a fall out with the authors of the novel, who do not regard these movies, or at least the third one (?) as an official adaptation. But I'm not sure of the details. It's kind of sad, because the first 2 did quite a good job of that.
So, are there going to be more Left Behind movies? I hope so, and I hope the filmmakers and the authors (both Christians) do come to some kind of amicable agreement, to tell these great stories, and that it will give the film-makers a chance to get back on track with the novels.
PS: 2-3 months after I buy this from Amazon, Sony Pictures in Japan decides to release the Japanese version after all, titled 'Human Vanishings: Final War'!

I love the movies.  The characters I believe have been cast well and I hope that the actors playing the major rolls will continue on with future movies.

My only problem with it is that I wish someone with Mel Gibson's finances were making the movie.  The quality is a bit low budget and I believe that if it were better financed it would be better quality and higher box office ratings (like The Passion) and therefore reach more people.  I also wish that the movies would follow the books a little closer than they do.

2497557,5,B000E5KUKG,"Cloud Ten Pictures has been in the forefront of Christian film since they first came on to the scene with their groundbreaking film, ""Apocalypse."" Fusing biblical prophecy with clever writing and intriguing characters and plotting, producers Peter and Paul Lalonde have been responsible for bringing Christian film into the mainstream. So it was no surprise when it was announced that Cloud Ten Pictures would be responsible for translating the mega-selling ""Left Behind"" book series to the screen.

Between October of 2000, and September of 2005, three films have been made in the ""Left Behind"" film series. Combining powerful storytelling, rich characters, terrific performances, and cutting-edge special effects, these films have come to show that Christian film is here to stay. And while the films have never had the largest budgets, the cast and crew do a fantastic job in overcoming these short-comings, and creating powerful suspense and drama.

With power and excitement, ""Left Behind"" has made a successul transition from page to screen. We can only hope that these aren't the last films to be made from the works of Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. Even if they are, they are a great reminder of where Christian cinema is going. I highly recommend these films to both the fans of the books, and to fans of great films!
