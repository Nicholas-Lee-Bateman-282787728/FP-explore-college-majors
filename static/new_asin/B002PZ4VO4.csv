8377370,4,B002PZ4VO4,"These five workouts were just right for intermediate level.  I found that doing two and a half workouts one day and the rest another day was good.

I'm a senior exerciser, been working out over 40 years, a former runner and ex. instructor.  This program was safe and com-
fortable.

Recommend to all Weight Watchers.  Been  at goal or under  about 40 years now and still attend meetings.  Anyone who wants
a safe, sane exercise program would enjoy this cd.",1392508800,3,456,4.6125
8377371,4,B002PZ4VO4,I had this dvd before and lent it to a friend and she loved it so much she kept it.  I needed a replacement and was happy to find it on Amazon.,1380672000,,143,3.46875
8377372,5,B002PZ4VO4,"This is my all-time favorite DVD.  It helped me build muscles I had never seen before.  I hate lifted weights, but this video with aerobics made it fun.  AWESOME!!!",1370304000,,164,4.586206896551724
8377373,5,B002PZ4VO4,Great workout DVD with easy to follow moves.  Different workouts for different levels.  You can choose your own level and go from there.,1359504000,,136,4.869565217391305
8377374,4,B002PZ4VO4,"This is not a difficult workout to do if you need to fit in some weight-bearing exercise in a short amount of time.  I prefer the lower body and upper body workouts.  I normally run 3-4 mornings a week, and I alternate between the workouts on this video the other days to include some strength training.  You can increase the intensity by increasing the amount of weight used.  Enjoy Michele's energy.",1298764800,3,401,4.605633802816901
8377375,5,B002PZ4VO4,"Some people may be put off by the simplicity of this dvd, but I loved it.  I believe that weight loss must include exercise and this dvd gives you that edge.  If you are looking to have your butt kicked, this is not for you, but if you are looking for a good doable, toning workout it is for you.  I also believe that exercise needs to fit into our lives and be something we can do for life.  These kind of basic workouts serve that purpose for me.  If you are struggling to get started on a weights program you will love this dvd.  It offers you a place to start.  So you see, this dvd serves many purposes, a start, a place to maintain, and a time efficient workout.",1280534400,7,668,4.0534351145038165
8377376,4,B002PZ4VO4,"Led by Michelle Dozois without any background exercisers, this DVD has five 20-min chapters that can be done as individual workouts or all together as one very long one. If the cardio section wasn't a bit repetitious and too low impact for me I would have given it 5 stars. The strength training chapters are awesome, including the 'cardio abs' sections. I work out 7 days a week and have hundreds or workout DVDs, but I think I have never felt my obliques the next day like this, wow! Also, most of the strength training is compound moves, even if it says 'upper body', which I prefer to make the most of my time. Michelle's instructions are just fine and easy to follow. There is just the right amount of talk, no chatter. In fact, I found this DVD better than some of her earlier Breakthru ones. I will probably substitute the cardio workout, but I'm really glad I found this DVD.",1267228800,8,883,4.45679012345679
