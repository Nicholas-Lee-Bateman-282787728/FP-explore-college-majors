8050505,3,B0007QJ1X4,"Fair Mexican-Guatemalan made, filmed in Guatemala, Spanish language (no dubbing or sub-titles) film of second string pro-wrestlers battling a mad scientist, his dwarf henchmen, and his zombies.  The scientist is looking to extend his life via transplants from viable unwilling donors.  Our wrestlers, when not wrestling in the ring, tool around in sup-par vehicles trying to find the kidnap victims.  A poor musical number entertains the masses during the off-time.  Not great but not bad.  The Ground Zero DVD is good but not perfect quality.  Recommended for fans of this genre.",1489536000,,580,5.318681318681318
8050506,1,B0007QJ1X4,"The film itself looks to be a lot of fun, especially if you're into silly (and extremely cheesy) masked wrestlers vs. monsters flicks like I am. Unfortunately, the DVD is so terrible that I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes. The audio is absolutely horrible, full of constant static. Adding insult to injury, THERE ARE NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. (It's too bad Rise Above Entertainment - the folks who've brought us some great El Santo discs in the past - didn't get their hands on this one.)",1115596800,11,491,4.655172413793103
