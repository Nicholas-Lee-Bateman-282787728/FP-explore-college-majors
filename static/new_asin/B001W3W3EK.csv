3823940,5,B001W3W3EK,"20 years of waiting, but it was all worth it! The one thing I really like in this concert compared to other BA's live recorded concerts is the keyboardist Tommy Mandel who plays piano and organ simultaneously in songs like Everything I Do and that really sounds different in a good way.",1477699200,,286,4.519230769230769
3823941,5,B001W3W3EK,"Great concert, BA before 70, 000 or something.  He wasn't huge in the U.S. at this point, so it's nice to see him getting the love by a huge crowd, and the band puts on a tremendous performance.  It's a 1996 video, but it looks fine and the sound is excellent, and he does some cool covers along with the usual BA material.  For fans of BA, an essential purchase.",1476748800,8,363,4.1571428571428575
