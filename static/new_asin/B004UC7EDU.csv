8441406,5,B004UC7EDU,"How can a film about two homeless guys be uplifting? From the very first snippets of shared dialog between Donald and Sam (played terrifically by Barry Primus and Charlie Robinson) we know we are on to something extraordinary. Their journey weaves through fantastic flights of gorgeous opera, (done up terrifically by composer Frankie Blue) and beautiful soliloquies to adventure soaked moments of both personal triumph and defeat. In the process they learn that there is more to life than their singular, lonely existence... and they slowly come to seeing that something binds them that is irresistible to the both of them, and to those that surround them. The human condition at work, in a 90 minute film. It is funny, sad, thought provoking, and yes, uplifting.  A joy to watch.",1354060800,2,781,5.007692307692308
8441407,5,B004UC7EDU,"Jackson was screened at the Lake Arrowhead Fim Festival to a packed theatre.  The audience loved the film and gave it a standing ovation.  I have seen the film many times and each time I love it more.  The opera arias are fantastic and the way the filmmaker, JF Lawton, weaves them through the various scenes is brilliant.  The acting by Barry Primus and Charlie Robinson are, in my opinion, Oscar quaility.  This film is sure to delight.",1322697600,2,438,4.564102564102564
8441408,5,B004UC7EDU,"Jackson is a timeless film. It transcends traditional film making in that the writer appears not to care about the status quo in Hollywierd.  Jackson is entertaining and ballsy and arty, yeah, I said it.  Barry Primus will make you love him. The cast is one of the best mixes of talent I've seen in a long time. If you like movies that make you feel emoptional right at your core, you will love Jackson. I did.  By the way, the director aslo wrote pretty woman.
Yeah, I said it.",1228694400,,478,4.288888888888889
