963023,5,6305046913,"I have just finished viewing this movie and am speechless. First, to have the movie shot on location at Auschwitz with the remains of the camp in use and in view was numbing. To actually see the ""mock"" selections, assurances of a hot shower and the lie of the ""health camp"" for children put a touch of realism to some of the Holocaust survivor accounts that I have read. I did not live through the Holocaust but if this movie was one tenth of one percent of what it really was like, may God comfort and be merciful to the survivors and their families. I have never heard of the main character, played by Willem Dafoe, but he must have been a very brave man. I salute you, sir and as a Christian, I ask your forgiveness for what was done to the Jewish people in the name of Jesus Christ. I cautiously recommend this film for any serious student of the Holocaust, and urge that the message therein never be forgotten or repeated. Thank you.",1043366400,27,938,4.3352272727272725
963024,5,6305046913,"Triumph of the Spirit is probably the most realistic dramatic recreation of the horrors of Auschwitz I've seen.  Director Robert Young is a pro at bringing controversial independent films to fruition, and Dafoe gives one of his best performances here.  He portrays Salamo Arouch, a Greek Jewish Olympic boxer deported to Auschwitz.  This true story was filmed on location at Auschwitz and Birkenau (Auschwitz II) and we are shown the death machine in full operation.  Again there is an intensity and realism to this film that makes Schindler's List pale in comparison.

Edward James Olmos portrays a gypsy singer who becomes a key ally of Salamo; Gypsy entertains the SS and Salamo boxes for them while they hope for the Russians to come.  One relatively minor flaw of the film is that the actors who portray SS and camp guards seem benign, almost nice at times, and I really doubt the actual female guards were as good looking as a few of the Frauleins here.

But a good touch of realism is the languages.  The Germans speak German, the Poles speak Polish, and the Russians speak Russian all without subtitles (compare this to Schindler's List).  And the make up job was great; the victims really looked like they were on death's door.

If you want to know about the Holocaust this drama is near the top of the list with the best documentaries.  And Polanski's ""The Piano"" should be good too.",1041465600,20,1393,4.738589211618257
963025,5,6305046913,"I agree with Leonard Ross, this movie is much better than Schindler's List.  It is much more accurate and gritty and realistic in its portrayal of life in the camps.  It is also a movie about family bonds, love and relationships and shows how these bonds were ravaged by what took place during WW II.  Short of showing actual film footage in my classroom, this movie speaks volumes about the plight of the Jewish people during the Holocaust.",979862400,19,441,4.628205128205129
963026,5,6305046913,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and, alongwith Life is Beautiful, the best Holocaust movie made (in myopinion). Unlike Schindler's List, this movie portrays graphically what was really going on in the Auschwitz death camp (and other camps as well). It showed people undressing, preparing to enter the gas chamber. It showed the hellish daily life of the camp inmates--the agonizing work they had to do for the majority of each day, their horrific sleeping conditions, their deprivation of food, and the incredibly frequent beating and murdering of the prisoners by sick, sadistic Nazis. What really got to me the most was how the main character was actually getting thinner from starvation as the movie went on!
Scindler's List was a very dramatic, moving, well done movie, but it didn't accurately portray the true horrors of the Holocaust. The director was probably afraid to show anything that would be too graphic and disturbing for the general public and film critics. Spielberg was right in being cautious, as few people would be able to stomach a movie like Triumph of the Spirit. That is probably why this movie is virtually unknown.
My only complaint about this movie is that the main character gave a rather limp performance. A better actor in his place would have made this an absolutely perfect movie.",954979200,12,1330,4.915555555555556

Though there was little character development, I felt the film showed life in Auschwitz in a way that is unique. It shows the raw brutality of the Nazis without relying on an excessive amount of blood and gore to stun the viewer. It was also refreshing to see a film that showed the perspective of Greek Jews during World War II. So if you're interested in learning about World War II and the Holocaust, this is a good movie.

It just dragged, and there was no reality to it as far as special effects and such. Jews were brushing past German SS guards, like that would ever have happened. And the scenes were bled dry, okay, move on, enough close ups and dead air. He fought for some high ranking officer, but who? Was it the commandant, Hoess? If he did so well, was there some special treatment? More facts needed to come out. It had a great set, I imagine alot was filmed at the Auschwitz/Birkenau camp? Either that or they built a replica. I liked it because I am of Greek descent and was proud of him as a person who perservered through this hell.

963179,5,6305046913,"I'd never heard of this movie, or this person known as the boxer Salamo. It just so happened that I rose early the other morning and this was showing on my retro channel. I missed the beginning and only started watching when the Nazi officer compelled him to box the other prisoners. From there, I was spell-bound.

There are so many scenes, so many that make you want to reach out and to comfort. You want to think, ""No. This is just a movie."" But it isn't. This nightmare was real. It happened, and that's what's so awful.

As others commented, the one scene that was so heart wrenching, so overwhelming, so raw was the one where he and his father parted. The love demonstrated, where the father showed his courage by reassuring his son, and accepting his fate with a smile, was perhaps the one I'll carry with me always. I wonder - if it were me in such a situation, could I be that strong?

963180,4,6305046913,"After seeing many documentaries and films about the holocaust I am still unable to comprehend that such horrible events actually happened. To think that human beings did such horrible things to their own kind is truly horrific to even begin to try and understand. This film, actually shot inside Auschwitz is another sobering reminder of the horrors that took place in the Nazi death camps. Though the film makes the whole shocking event of the holocaust look rather tame compared to what historical records, testimony and images have proven, it was effective enough to imagine how truly horrible it really was to exist in such unthinkable circumstances. This film while not as realistic as Schindler's list, it does examine the horrible living conditions and day to day misery that prisoners of Auschwitz had to endure. It's clearly a watered down version that doesn't begin to convey how horrifying living conditions there were really like anyway. Dafoe and Loggia give incredibly touching performances that make this film work. This film shot almost entirely within the original death camp at Auschwitz and it makes the entire journey a true sense of realism none the less. Well worth seeing.",1367884800,2,1195,5.1020408163265305
963181,3,6305046913,"What you end up seeing here is not what was on the menu. Though not bad by any means, it lacks focus.

Here's the scoop. Dafoe and his family are Jews who live in pre-WWII Greece. He's a formidible boxer, and when the Nazis round the family up, and throw them in Auschwitz, he ends up boxing for one of the upper-ups and takes on anyone they send into the ring. If he wins, his sponser wins money. If he loses, he is no longer of any use.

This is based on a true story but there isn't much story here. A small amount of time is spent in the set up, showing family life before the Nazis for a few minutes. Then they show life as they are herded into a ghetto, then finally when they are sent to Auschwitz. When they arrive there the viewer gets an eyeful of life in a concentration camp. Though there might be a few new details and insights here it isn't much more than you've already seen a number of times.

The box art and tag line make you think the story is wrapped around the boxing, when surprisingly little time is spent on it. He fights. He wins bouts. He gets better work assignments and eats a bit better than his fellow prisoners. But there's no struggle for him. He's a good boxer and his prowess isn't challenged to any great degree. And it does nothing to earn him his freedom. The Russians and Allies are getting closer so the Nazis just abandon the camp and the prisoners wander off.

This isn't a bad watch by any means. All the acting is good. It's directed well enough and all the other production values are right on. One odd note was that there were scenes where two Germans would be speaking to each other in German, and there were no subtitles. And these weren't short conversations. WTF?! What was the purpose of that?

Anyway....not a bad watch, just not much of a movie.",1337299200,,1797,4.258064516129032
963182,4,6305046913,"Enjoyed this movie very much.  The concentration camp situation has been seen in film many times (The Grey Zone), but this movie throws in the ""boxing for survival"" piece, and thanks to Willem Dafoe's incredible acting the movie becomes distinctive.  With boxing being more a sport of survival than one of competition, I thought the story a perfect metaphor for the overall jewish holocaust survivors.  Not only does a boxer fight against a crafty and often cruel opponent, but he must fight the urge of his own body and soul crying out to him to quit and give up the fight.

Triumph of the Spirit strips back the flesh to reveal that crying soul doing whatever he or she has to in a situation where only the strong and enduring survive.

Great performances by veteran actors Edward James Olmos and Robert Loggia. There are hidden moments in this film where the all-seeing human spirit is silently captured in the eye contact between the actors.  It is in these exchanges that I felt the truest impact and challenge the holocaust had on these victims and their oppressors.  Faith, hope and compassion have taken a holiday off and left humanity with its primal instincts of survival.",1330992000,,1182,4.764705882352941
963183,5,6305046913,"Triumph of the Spirit, 1989 film

This movie is based on the experiences of Salamo Arouch, a Greek boxer who was sent to Auschwitz and survived. It tells about life and death in a Nazi concentration camp, and shows the horrors that are seldom mentioned on today's popular television (as if it was ancient history). This movie uses classic restraint, the horrors are off-screen. Those who were old and sick were sent to the extermination camp. The women were kept in a separate camp, their life was just as hard. Children were sent to a ""holiday camp"" and never seen again. A pregnant woman could be sent to a laboratory where neither baby or mother survived.

Salamo's experience as a boxer lets him be used for entertainment, like musicians and others. He survives, but loses his brother and father. When a siren sounds a warning the guards and prisoners seek shelter. [I read that Auschwitz was never bombed because it was beyond the range of fighter escorts, and was not a prime military target.] There is an explosion that damages a furnace, the presumed guilty are shot. The prisoners hear rumors that the Russian Army is approaching. The healthy prisoners will be herded back to Germany, the rest will go ""up the chimney"". Then we learn ""its over"". The details of the liberation from Nazi rule are omitted. [Still too controversial?]

The look and details suggest a European production, they would best know the facts. The names of the actors in the credits tell where this was produced (the actual location of Auschwitz-Birkenau). This was only one of the many concentration and extermination camps. Oswiecim was the headquarters and training grounds of the Polish Cavalry. Just as Theresenstadt was a Czecho-Slovak military base from the times of the Austrian empire. I think Auschwitz was the site of a synthetic fuel factory; it had coal, water, lime, and the very cheap labor needed as raw materials.

This is the only film in English that is set in a concentration camp to tell about its horrors. ""Escape from Sobibor"" did not list the horrors as this film does. ""Playing for Time"" also was set in a concentration camp. They are worth viewing as a history lesson. Movies provide drama and entertainment, they won't replace history books. Concentration camps were a corporation's dream. They provided very cheap labor at a minimal wage, no medical costs or vacations, not even a pension. These films seldom mention the corporations that profited from their operations.",1311033600,,2479,4.909307875894988
963184,4,6305046913,"Having watched numerous Holocaust movies, I had put off watching ""Triumph of the Spirit"" because I had wrongly assumed that the movie's primary focus was on boxing, even though it was centered in that most notorious of all concentration camps, Auschwitz. Well, I finally decided to watch it last night, since it is a fact-based Holocaust drama and I was very impressed at the credible portrayal of the main character, Salamo Arouch by actor Willem Dafoe.

The movie is actually quite subtle for a Holocaust drama - many of the horrors awaiting the Jewish victims at the extermination camp Auschwitz are subtly portrayed. One scene is especially horrific to me - masses of Jewish Greeks clapping when the Nazis declare they are to be given hot showers before being reunited with their loved ones...and then walking down the steps taking them to the gas chambers where they would be murdered en masse. The murder scenes are not portrayed - but the innocence of these hapless victims, who could not possibly comprehend the evils the Nazis were capable of just struck me to my very core.

Salamo Arouch finds himself in this living hell that is Auschwitz - separated from his sweetheart Allegra (Wendy Gazelle who like other able women was housed in a separate camp, Birkenau), but together with his father (Robert Loggia in a particularly noteworthy performance) and younger brother, tries to survive day to day until his boxing prowess attracts the attention of a senior Nazi officer who promptly gets him to participate in matches where the Nazi officers bet big bucks and where the winner is lucky to be rewarded with an entire loaf of bread. Salamo realizes this is his chance for earning extra rations (in a camp like Auschwitz starvation is rampant) though he is also aware that the risks are high.

The movie is interesting (at least for me) because it provides insights into the social structure of the camp - there are the Nazi officers who basically lounge around enjoying the spoils of their victims; the Kapos who are brutal in carrying out the orders by the Nazis, even if it means brutalizing their own people; and of course the prisoners themselves who are treated as sub-humans or less. Edward James Olmos is compelling in his portrayal of a Gypsy Kapo who is merciless and brutal, but who eventually softens and forms a subtle rapport with Dafoe's Arouch.

Though Arouch's story is at the heart of the drama, there is another secondary narrative revolving around the plight of Arouch's sweetheart, Allegra who together with her sister tries to stay alive, not knowing if Arouch is still alive. The situation in the women's camp appears even more desperate as the women fight with each other over a piece of bread and even shoes, turning on each other almost bestially in order to survive. This matches with my own reading of history books which portray the situation in Birkenau as unimaginably desperate.

Those who are familiar with the Holocaust will appreciate some of the subtler aspects of the story such as Salamo's brother's fate when he refuses to be part of a work detail cleaning up the gas chambers and carrying out corpses - the work detail referred to here is the Sonderkommando which comprised able-bodied men who were literally condemned to carry out the most gruesome task of disposing of the bodies of victims murdered in the gas chambers - and who were provided good rations, though due to the nature of the work, they were rotated and sent up the chimneys themselves after a short period.

""Triumph of the Spirit"" is a compelling Holocaust drama that portrays the tenacity of the human spirit under the most deplorable conditions. I would recommend this to those who are keen on learning more about the Holocaust through fact-based dramas, and also the following, also based in Auschwitz:

963235,5,6305046913,"As a child growing up I had to endure the sometimes mad and raving ramblings of my father who is a dyed-in-the-wool Holocaust revisionist and an admirer of all things German.  I was given a German name, a German godfather, and most of my relatives married Germanic people even though my family does not have an ounce of German blood at all.  So when I was going to school I was really confused and I thought to myself "" why don't I find out my own truth and not have my Father tell me things that HE believes are true, but are true to me? "" So in middle school I spent countless hours in the library ( which was brimming over with a wealth of informative and educational, ah, what America once was ) and I would choose many books on the Holocaust and WWII.  I picked up a book named "" A Nightmare In History "" and needless to say my life changed FOREVER.
  If such a thing such as the Holocaust actually NEVER ocurred as my Father and the countless Hitler lovers and Neo-Nazis in the world say never ocurred, then I truly despise being born a human being and inhabiting this sick and twisted world.  This was truly a soul-crushing, harrowing, nightmarish view of a world I knew about when I was a child being indoctrinated into believing it wasn't true but seeing it actually being brought to the silver screen was surreal and the most brutal, engaging, engrossing, and lividly disgusting depiction of what we as men do to our brothers and sisters.
  Without going into much detail there are things in this movie that will shock ANYBODY who can call themselves a person, no matter what horror or blood and guts movie they have ever seen.  The acting is solid and the affected relationship between father and son ( Willem Dafoe and Robert Loggia ) is truly heartbreaking and painful to watch.  When Salomo finally was forced to say goodbye to his Father I couldn't stop crying, it had to be one of the most painful scenes I have ever seen on a movie screen.  The last 10 minutes of the movie to me are the worst, bar none.  I won't give anything away, all I have to say is that this movie isn't a movie at all, it is more like a going through a time machine and waking up in a nightmare world where all you want to do is escape, and anybody who believes in God above has to know that although God allows such things to happen time and time again, be it in Rwanda, Cambodia, Germany, Poland, wherever and when it happens again ( as it most likely will somewhere ) there is a silver lining to ever story:  God is eternal just like the Jewish people, who have been much maligned and forced to suffer thoughout history for the faults and sins of their ancestors, and no matter how or why they have become who they are, no matter what you may think of them or any other race of people you admire or despise, we are all human, we are all brothers, we are all on this planet for a purpose, the purpose of being good, honest and decent people who were put here to live happy lives and love our neighbors and all the living creatures God put on this Earth.  I am a Christian and I try to love everybody equally, and although sometimes my inherent prejudices do come out ( because all of us have them, no matter what we may think ) I try to put myself in the other person's shoes and I try to remember that every man, woman and child on this planet has a soul, a spirit that can be uplifted or taken down, exalted or shattered, but it is always there and GUESS WHAT:  NO MAN IS BORN EVIL, I TRULY BELIEVE THAT.  The world has a way of making men evil, but all of us have a chance to redeem ourselves and try to make the world a place that we can enjoy to live in.

963240,4,6305046913,"I am more disatified with nearly all the reviews then the movie itself. This boxer had basically become a specialized kapo. And if you don't know what a kapo is, it is a prisoner who turns against their own and gets more food and other things denied to the others. In slavery regarding the blacks, there were people who turned in their own relatives to have a better chance of not being a slave themselves. In Auschwitz and other death camps, some of the kapos started liking hurting and killing their own and some even were geniunelly pleased when Nazi overseer's praised them for their 'work'. I can understand this is probably
human nature at its worst and could hardly be helped, but how can this be a triumph of the spirit? It was a global tragady. If your going to make a movie about this boxer, why not make a movie
of other kapos who were worse. Will the movie be called 'Triumph of the spirit again'? This boxer was lucky other Jews didn't kill him after liberation because fellow prisoners with 'lower'
status killed some of the kapos after liberation for their betrayal to their own people. This was legally wrong, but once again, it was human nature for some, ie revenge or even a slight bit of personal justice. To roughly quote a Holocaust survivor, this is not meant to dishonor the prisoners who did bad things to fellow prisoners. It was a man-made society that failed miserably and utterly dishonored itself. I prefer seeing a movie referring to all the good things prisoners did
for others even sacrificing their lives for others in the camps, like the prisoner who didn't have to, but joined 200 children all alone in the gas chambers to comfort them while they were in horror and death. THAT type of example is truely 'Triumph of the Spirit' and if people can't see that, then this world is really in trouble.",1103673600,17,1830,4.565349544072948
963241,4,6305046913,"What does it take to live when your chances are equal to a zero?  What does it mean to survive at the expense of the others?  WWII, Greece, Germans, Jews, camps, death...  A young, strong boxer has a chance to fight.  The SS would have fun betting on it.  If he wins, he gets to live a little longer and a loaf of bread.  Many people get a piece of this bread but most of all is his father and a brother.  They are all he still have.  He wins and lives.  The looser dies.  Every time he wins, he saves whatever left of the family.  Every time he wins, he kills the looser.  At the end, only he survives.  The whole family is dead.  All friends are dead.  Was he right?  Was not it easier to die?  Yes, it was easier to die but he selects the difficult way of living being responsible for deaths of other fighters.  He was able to prolong lives of the loved ones.  He lived to tell the story and to fight another day.  His spirit was not broken but triumphed.
This is an outstanding film with an excellent cast and the deepest power I have seen for a while.  All I can say is see it for yourself and enjoy the best.",1050710400,45,1114,3.9954337899543377
