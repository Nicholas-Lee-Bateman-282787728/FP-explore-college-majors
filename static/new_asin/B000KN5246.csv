8158396,2,B000KN5246,It is very short and could include much more for the money. I get as much for free in youtube and free articles. I was disappointed with the amount of information given. I guess it is great if you know nothing and do not know how to browse or have dialup and can't use youtube.,1276214400,,277,4.054545454545455
8158397,2,B000KN5246,"I was disappointed in this video because it didn't cover a lot of the questions I have about soldering - how to keep my tip clean (use of sponge, use of a sal ammonic block), how to tin my tip, etc. Instead, Payne just covers the act of soldering. She also moves very quickly and doesn't always explain what she means, which makes it a little confusing. I was looking for a a video course in copper-foil soldering and this did not really explain to me how to correct the issues I'm having with my own soldering. While it was helfpul to see someone in the act of soldering, I didn't get $30 worth of advice from the video.",1233532800,4,621,4.226890756302521
8158398,4,B000KN5246,"This is the first time I have seen Vicki Payne. I learned to do stained glass many years ago when I lived in Tucson. I bought this video a year or so ago when I was considering getting getting back into the hobby to do a couple of special pieces for friends but I never got around to watching it.

 Frankly, my soldering technique was never that good and recently, when I had to do some soldering for a metal project I remembered this video and decided to watch it. The video is relatively short, but, how much can you really say about soldering. The summary on Amazon is a little overblown in regards to safety. OK, you should work in a vented place and never leave your soldering iron laying around.

The discussion of types of solder and when to use it was good. A couple of handy hints on flux were also of value.

What I really liked was the recommendations on spot soldering and the visual demo of came and foil soldering technique. I also picked up some tips on soldering brass which was what I was really looking for. I guess that I am one of those people that learns better by seeing it done.

I gave the video a 4 because it told me exactly what I wanted to know. Production technique was OK and Vicki was easy to understand.

 Could it have been done in 10 minutes and would the info all fit on one sheet of paper? yes. Would I have learned as much? No! Was it too expensive for what you get? Probably, but you do pay a premium for experience. Will it win any awards? No. Will I try another of her videos? Probably.",1209859200,6,1526,4.187713310580205
8158399,3,B000KN5246,For this actor this is good.  I personally do not like her but this time she is at least informative. Not as bad as her other videos. Would not necessarily recommend it but for basic info sure go for it.,1207526400,,203,4.075
