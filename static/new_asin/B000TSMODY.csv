8210665,4,B000TSMODY,"Having introduced the kooky Sohma family and their curse, ""Fruits Basket"" starts introducing some of its darker dimensions.

To make matters even more complex, ""Fruits Basket, Volume 2: What Becomes of Snow?"" introduces us to three new members of the Sohma family, as well as a look at how the mysterious Akito rules over them. But despite these darker moments, the series never strays too far from the warm-hearted comedy and appealing characters.

Our leads are all involved in the school's Cultural Festival, despite Yuki's distress at having to wear a dress. But then two new Sohmas turn up: bubbly rabbit Momiji, and the chilly Hatori, who tells Tohru to meet him at the Sohma main house -- alone. Despite Tohru's nervousness, she obeys -- and finds out the painful facts about Hatori's past, and the isolation felt by cursed Sohmas.

When New Year's rolls around, Tohru and her friends help Kyo and Yuki clean the house, while Shigure torments his hysterical editor Mii. They're expected back at the main Sohma house, but the boys are reluctant to leave Tohru alone. And a school endurance run is interrupted by Haru Sohma, who is determined to fight Kyo -- but their battle is interrupted when Yuki collapses.

Then Valentine's Day comes around. Tohru has chocolate for everyone (literally), Yuki is stalked by his fangirls, and Kagura is busily trying to feed Kyo a chocolate heart the size of his head. And a month later, Momiji repays Tohru's favour by giving her an extravagant gift -- a trip to a hot spring.

There are definitely some darker moments to ""Volume 2: What Becomes of Snow?"" Most of these come from Hatori's tragic past, and the revelation of just what a lonely, painful life many of the zodiac members lead. Even the younger ones like Haru aren't immune, since we see that he was often mocked for his animal's part in the old zodiac folktale.

But don't worry, the dark spots are surrounded by lots of heartwarming moments (Momiji's ""foolish traveler"" story) and goofy dialogue (""No means NO, woman!""). And there's loads of comedy, from Shigure tormented Mii by refusing to write the rest of his novel, to the shrieking hostess at the hot spring. (""AAAAAAAAA! I'm sorry, world! I apologize for this boy! I'm SORREEEEEE..."").

I have to admit that the hot spring episode is a bit slow, since much of it involves eating and soaking. And singing. But it has some cute moments like Yuki laughing, and the crazed ping-pong game.

We also get to see some different sides of Tohru and her friends -- for instance, it's revealed that despite her cheery demeanor, Tohru is sometimes very lonely for her mother. Yuki continues trying to come out of his shell, while Kyo verrrrrry slowly tries to overcome his social awkwardness. The ""plum on the back"" scene ends up being adorable because of this.

And we get to meet some new Sohmas, particularly Haru and Hatori. Haru has a dual personality -- one placid and serene, one violent and lecherous -- and a tumultuous past with Yuki. And Hatori comes across as the most tragic figure thus far, convinced that he is doomed to loneliness, and haunted by what happened when he dared to love someone.

""Fruits Basket, Volume 2: What Becomes of Snow?"" introduces us to some new Sohmas, and some dark secrets. But it also never lets up on the warm'n'fuzzy smiles.",1229472000,,3320,4.778359511343805
8210666,5,B000TSMODY,"This is actually my second DVD of this volume because my other one cracked. Now, it already has been some time since I bought it here, so this review is very behind.
At that time, the price was great because in other sites, it was around $30. I adore this anime & the manga! If you are looking for comedy, little innocent romance, a dash of fantasy, and some great people philosophy, this is THE one (and the other DVDs).",1208217600,,421,4.275
