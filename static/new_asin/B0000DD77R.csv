There are a couple speacial features on the 2 discs it comes with including a documentary with Phil. The only problem is that I wish they could of put the whole concert on 1 disc instead of two, but you can't always get what you want. Anyway's buy this dvd you'll love it!",1367625600,,437,3.9213483146067416

1924345,5,B0000DD77R,"One of my favorite 80's/90's performers.  Bought this to replace the VHS I had.  I love watching this guy onstage, especially behind the drums.",1306022400,,143,4.916666666666667
1924346,3,B0000DD77R,"I purchased this 2 set DVD, because I had absolutely no Phil Collins
CD's, cassettes, mini discs, VHS. No Phil Collins or Genesis. All I
had was the memory of seeing him live with Genesis, way back with
Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Wishbone Ash, Atomic Rooster and Alvin Lee.
I believe he was singing, or perhaps behind the drums.

This DVD was originally released about 20 years ago on VHS. Then
transferred to 5.1 digital for those that love surround sound.
[For track listing I would suggest reading other reviewers of this
of this product.]

Disc 2 just simply ""rocks."" Thanks to a brilliant backing band. The
horn section, the bass player, guitarist, and the primary drummer, do
what they are paid to do. Hold it down. The crowd agrees by waving
their hands,[as in Depeche Mode concerts], in the air.

I am not impressed by Phil's piano playing. Holding down chords in the
key of D minor [In the Air Tonight][Relative major key of F],is not
difficult. For this song it is the atmospheric aura that nulls the senses.
Also writing a song that repeats itself about a divorce is also not hard.
Phil just has a way of ""pulling it off"".Lastly the backing singers are off
key, although full marks for making the effort.

For any true Phil Collins fan this DVD set is a must. For me I believe
I might keep it for a short time, before selling to the highest bidder!
Then I will own no Phil Collins. To use Phil's own words that he uttered
at Live Aid in 1985, ""Ere funny kinda world, ain't it?",1296259200,,1486,4.452205882352941
1924347,5,B0000DD77R,"Phil Collins on Tour was probably big when seen live, despite the heat, crowding and wait. The music and arrangements were all Phil Collins. It has been some time since I was a Collins fan so some of the show was lost on me. I honestly thought I was buying the CD, but got the DVD by mistake (my fault during ordering). I later bought the CD, which is what I wanted so I could hear the music in the truck. Thanks for the rapid service on both CD, etc. As always, very dependable.

1924352,5,B0000DD77R,I am a huge fan of Phil Collins and if you want to hear some of his earlier music this video provides it all.  There are songs on this that I had not heard for a number of years.  It was great to go back in time with him.  It rivals his latest video which proposed to be his last tour.  Sit back with some friends and enjoy 3 hours of great music.,1252713600,,347,3.712328767123288

1924354,5,B0000DD77R,Phil Collins is one of the most popular singers of all time. This DVD is great and the sound is perfect.,1203984000,,104,4.0
1924355,4,B0000DD77R,"Phil Collins gives a long seriously long concert in Berlin, Germany, on July 25, 1990, doing 24 songs! This is one of the longest one-man concert videos I've ever seen.

Actually, as good as Collins' songs are, and as good a singer as he is, it's almost too much....at least for one continuous viewing. It's almost three hours of music! I was surprised all of this could fit on a VHS tape. I'm not complaining, just saying it is very hard to sit down and watch this whole thing in one viewing. After the first look, I wound up breaking it into segments, and even skipping a number of songs that didn't have as much appeal as others. Having the DVD, as opposed to the old VHS tape, makes it a lot easier to skip to another number.

Like all good performers, Collins has excellent backup help, instrumentally and vocally. The lighting also is very colorful in here which definitely adds tot he view-ability of the concert. You need colors and other visual gimmicks (dry ice, in here), otherwise you're better off with just a CD. Phil, to his credit, is pretty animated, too, which also helps. He is so self-assured that feels comfortable with the huge crowd, even though he doesn't speak their language. (He has to read his German from a sheet of paper.)

Anywhile, like Rod Stewart and others with unlimited energy, Phil just keeps going and going. Although some songs sound very similar, it's still very good, solid music and entertainment. You sure get your money's worth!""",1189036800,,1474,4.639846743295019
1924356,5,B0000DD77R,"I have to say this is my favorite Phill Collins live dvd.  I tend to favor Phils work that has not been top 10 on pop charts.  This dvd is a perfect example of what I love...the best of his tours have always been promoting albums, when he plays such a better variety of the real Phil music, not just the air-play stuff like in his Final farewell tour (which I also like, but will watch this 10 times to one of that).",1143417600,,416,4.0
1924357,4,B0000DD77R,"El recital en Berln es espectacular, al igual que la presentacin de este DVD doble. En la cspide de su xito (1990), Phill y los super-profesionales msicos que le acompaan recrean una obra histrica muy bien filmada donde se resume la inigualable msica de los 80's. Imperdible.",1140652800,,275,4.872340425531915
1924358,5,B0000DD77R,"One of Phil best concerts mastered on DVD. This concert was in Berlin in Germany. A huge crowd, clear pictures and good sounds. The quality of the sounds is extremely good. I keep watching this show from time to time. The band that plays with Phil needs to be salute. The band gave its best.

I recommend this DVD. You will not be dissapointed unless you have a bad system that can produce good pictures and sounds.",1137456000,,415,4.3896103896103895
1924359,2,B0000DD77R,"I own both the Paris DVD and the Berlin DVD.  Played both on my IBM ThinkPad T30 (with SHURE professional earbud) and my Nakamichi DVD Player (with Boston Acoutic speakers and later tried on QUAD Electro Magnetic Earphones).  The Berlin DVD sound reproduction is poor.  Case in point, the Berlin DVD shows the volume and clarity of the music with strong degree of volality throughout the concert, as if there were technical problems during recording. The problem is not salient if you listen to this DVD on a boombox type of player but its weakness was totally exposed when you play on a more demanding system. Initially, I thought it was a random product defect of my DVD and returned to the shop for an exchange but the problem persists thus I determine this is a universal problem.

It is disappointing as the Berlin concert certainly has better energy and song selections than the Paris concert however, it was totally ruined by the acoustic quality.  If you are an audiophile, between the two, I advise you buy the Paris concert, much better acoustic reproduction. If you just listen to this on your low end laptop or low end DVD player with sound reproduction from the speakers on your TV, buy this one.",1113609600,,1209,4.683962264150943
1924360,5,B0000DD77R,I was never really a big Phil Collins fan until I saw this concert DVD.  He is an incredible talented musician.  The video quality is so so but sound quality is good (but would have been better if the DVD was offered in DTS sound).,1110326400,,231,4.111111111111111
1924361,5,B0000DD77R,"Finally, this great concert is released on dvd.  I have the vhs and I've played it to death.  This concert never gets old or boring.  I put it on so I can listen to it while doing housework but I always end up sitting and watching it or just dancing all around the house.  It's a joy to hear a real musician play real music instead of all that sampled stuff that's out today.

There is no lip synching or canned music here.  Phil and the band give an all out performance.  So much so that you can see how tired he is as the show is coming to an end and he sits down on stage to finish his last song.  You don't want to miss the drum duet by Phil and Chester.  It's one of the high points in the concert.  This dvd is a must have even if you've never heard of Phil Collins.

The only quibble I have is the performance of ""You can't hurry Love"".  I can do without it but you may love it.  Even so, it's great to hear an artist that sounds as good out of the studio as he does in the studio.  While Phil is no Mario Lanza, he can sing and he has good pitch.  As I stated earlier, he and his band are a bunch of real musicians.  The sound quailty is excellent.  I was shocked at how good it sounded through my stereo.  Sometimes, live concerts can sound a bit fuzzy.  The camera work is excellent as well.  Editing is smooth and captures the feel and the excitement of being there.  You'll feel like you were there.

Please treat yourself to this dvd.  It ROCKS!!!",1096502400,,1460,3.9930555555555554
1924362,4,B0000DD77R,"If you a Phil Collins fan, you will definitely like this DVD. I like the atmosphere. The only downside is that it does not have lyrics (I would have rated 5 stars, it it had).",1096070400,,175,4.0285714285714285
1924363,5,B0000DD77R,"Giving the full concert, these DVDs offer plenty of evidence for why Phil Collins must be considered one of the greatest entertainers and performers of the 80's and 90's. No less than 25 songs a featured in the set, hits as well as favorites from his new album, and even though there are a few missers and missings, this should offer anyone plenty of 80's nostalgia.
The performance is excellent without being Phil's best. I would at anytime recommand the Live And Loose In Paris DVD instead of this one - which is in fact probably his best live performance ever - but this doesn't meen that this concert isn't thoroughly enjoyable. In fact the performance of Take Me Home alone might be worth the purchase of the whole set, if you're into Phil's music - this traci brings new meening to the terms a-m-a-z-i-n-g and p-e-r-f-e-c-t. Must-see, must-hear, must-own. Other highlights include a wonderful versions of Do You Remember?, Doesn't Anybody Stay Together Anymore? and A Groovy Kind Of Love. Also, seing the 16.000 people of the crowd waving their hands in unison to the beat of Two Hearts is very impressing.
There are some drawbacks on this DVD. First of all, the sound is a bit sharp and metallic, even though this isn't as bad as on the CD release. On the visual side, the band is wearing some hideous dresses. Yes, I know, this is unimportant for the concert, but singer (?) Fred White is wearing a costume so lacking anything remote to good taste that I have to turn away from the screen everytime he's on (furthermore, he sounds most of all like a whorse crow). Also, the horn section Phil brought with him on this tour is not nearly as good as the one he used on the Dance Into The Light tour, as featured on the 1997 Live And Loose In Paris.
Finally, a note on the set-list. Pretty much all the hits are plyed here, but it's a pitty that songs like I Wish It Would Raing Down and Find A Way To My Heart were removed from the setlist at this part of the tour. Instead a pointless piese like Saturday Night And Sunday Morning was played. Also one might miss older favorites like I Don't Care Anymore, It Don't Matter To Me and You Know What I Meen - but then, the line would have to be drawn somewhere, and more than 2 hours of music is pretty impressive.",1076803200,,2265,4.421052631578948
1924364,5,B0000DD77R,"This is an absolutely superior live performance and show. Excellent sound, energy, video quality etc. I'm a great Phil Collins fan, but anyone who watches this concert would enjoy it. Phil Collins dedicates himself to putting on the best show he can for the people, everytime- it's why he's outstanding.",1076371200,,303,5.08
1924365,5,B0000DD77R,"Finally on dvd, this concert is Phil at his best. Although I prefer Genesis over his solo stuff, this show is really amazing and full of energy. The cd only had 13 songs on it, but the dvd version has the entire 2 hour and 44 minute show. There's only one part in between In The Air Tonight and You Can't Hurry Love where it was abviouly edited. They didn't hide it very well.
The sound quality is a little raw, but definitely not enough to make the dvd sound bad. Phil's drums are definitely more raw than Chester's. The video editing is perfect. The way ALL live dvds should be. The camera angles do not change every half second like a lot of live concert dvd's these days. It lets you focus on whatever is being shown and makes it a lot easier to watch.
The song selection is okay, but like I said. I'm not as big of a fan of his solo work. All his solo hits are played, as well of plenty less known songs, which a lot of those are good. Although I can't believe they didn't play ""I Wish It Would Rain Down"" from the album they were touring for at the time.
This is the last thing Phil Collins released before he sucked. Everything that came out after this is basically horrible. So I recommend this dvd to mark his last great achievement. (although I have not seen the Live And Loose In Paris dvd)",1074038400,,1301,4.166666666666667

I've been to one of his concerts and it was the best concert I ever went. Though I've not seen the DVD, I know this DVD won't disappoint and it's definitely the BEST!",1073865600,,317,3.676470588235294
1924367,5,B0000DD77R,"This 2-DVD set is probably one of Phil's best concerts ever.
Around the time of this recording, Phil was at the top of his game, and had four solo albums under his belt to choose from.
All of the hits like ""Sussudio"", ""One More Night"", ""In the Air Tonight"", ""You Can't Hurry Love"", ""Another Day in Paradise"", and ""Something Happened on The Way to Heaven"" are featured, as well as the lesser-known numbers ""Inside Out"", ""The West Side"", ""Hang in Long Enough"", ""Always"", and ""Colours.""
I highly recommend you view the tracks ""In the Air Tonight"", ""Do You Remember?"", and ""Take Me Home"" as soon as you purchase this masterpiece. They are by far Phil's best songs.",1073001600,,660,4.64957264957265

Features most of his biggest hits ""Against All Odds"", ""In The Air Tonight"", ""Another Day In Paradise"", ""Two Hearts"", ""Separate Lives"", ""Groovy Kind Of Love"", ""One More Night"" & ""Sussudio"" just to name a few.  Features 3 different camera angles on all the songs with the exception of 2 ""One More Night"" & ""Doesn't Anybody Stay Together Anymore"".  As anybody who has ever seen a Phil show knows he puts on a fabulous show.  Almost all of these songs performed on this live collection are perfect.  ""In The Air Tonight"" as always was performed tremendously with Phil pounding away on the drums, ""Colours"" a great rather unknown Phil song was also a powerful song climaxing with a Drum battle between Phil & Chester Thompson.  ""Separate Lives"" is performed sensationally between the vocal talents of Phil Collins & Bridgette Bryant.  This DVD truly is a Phil Collins fans dream...it even includes an interview with Phil.  Sensational DVD.",1070755200,,995,4.846153846153846
1924371,5,B0000DD77R,"This DVD is exceptionally good in sound and video.  I have some other music live dvd's, but this one stands apart.  The songs are good and energy is high throughout the program.  The DVD makes you feel that you are at the concert instead of listening in your living room. Mixing is too good.  Phil collins is great and musicians gave their 100%, that makes it too good dvd to buy.

1924373,3,B0000DD77R,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD.  From the moment it fires up; it is obvious that this is a VHS transfer.  The Warner logo is grainy and stands in stark contrast to the DVD menu (circa 2003).  The colors are a bit muted and don't have that resolute quality we are used to with DVD transfers.  Then throughout the DVD there are tracking issues with the video (most glaring is In the Air Tonight).
With that said, the performance is outstanding.  This is a big band and it is very cool to see a live horns section and very talented back-up singers.  Chester and Daryl are in fine form as always.  The sound is pretty decent, though a bit tinny.  The drums and guitar do sound very good; it's just the bottom end that is lacking.
So it's a bit of a toss up.  The performance is great, but there was not great care in restoring this concert.  Sure, it's 13 years old, but I just watched the Zepplin DVD (which is at least twice as old) and it is wonderfully restored.  Only buy if you are a huge Phil fan or get the Way We Walk DVD from Genesis for your Phil fix.",1069027200,,1064,4.1414634146341465
1924374,5,B0000DD77R,"If you would check through a number of websites, you would notice a number of import issues of this album for about an average of 60 US dollars plus change. I have had this album on a cassette ever since high school, evolved into one of my first cds i have ever purchased, and now a jewel in my dvd collection.
To give you an overview on this dvd, lets start with the visuals. Its amazing if you consider the amount of time that has chewed on this. You may have a little hesitation when you see the hair dews, clothing (yes, this is set within the eighties genre).
In regards to the audio, you may have to set your subwoofer up a bit. The bass on this dvd is not quite as low or as powerful as it is compared to the CD version. Nonetheless the sound seems to be quite well.
If you have considered to purchase this dvd check first the tracks and familiarize yourself if you remember and like any of them. If you have hesitations, why not get the CD first, then buy this. Im sure you will appreciate the sound quality and the tracks listed. If you want something a bit more updated you may consider his more recent work, LIVE AND LET LOOSE IN PARIS. This dvd is also a good contender, although they seem to have the same troubles with the subwoofer levels.
Do hope you enjoy this dvd!",1068681600,,1282,4.194331983805668
1924375,5,B0000DD77R,"Just like the other reviewer Mike I didn't want to wait for the November release date for this DVD and I paid over twice the going price for the import version. It was worth every penny, the sound quality is amazing and just like the Genesis ""The Way We Walk"" DVD you get all the great camera angles to choose from, They pushed back the release date for this DVD 3 Times already if you really want it I would highly recommend getting the import. It is well worth the price.",1064448000,,473,4.208791208791209
1924376,5,B0000DD77R,"From the outside cover of the dvd to the inside brocure and the dvd's themself is incredible.  I paid twice as much as the asking price for the Nov release but I wanted it asap and ordered as an import.  Believe me, it is woth it!  With up to four camera angles on just about every song, you can watch Phil at work, or otheres.  The sound mix is the absolute best I have heard on any concert DVD.  The video is brilliant.  You won't be let down!  The person responsible for the sound mix is just finished mixing Genesis's Invisible Touch tour to be released hopefully by the years end, which almost never saw the light of day for obscurity reasons ...",1064102400,,651,4.2439024390243905
8000763,5,B0000DD77R,Great concert on dvd but...  I will never pay $185.00 for it!  You want too much money!  Lower the price considerably and you might get my attention.  Ill might consider $50.00 but no more than that for just 1 dvd!,1517961600,,214,4.275
8000764,5,B0000DD77R,I saw his Motown concert on AXS. I never heard of him before. There was an interview on AXS and I missed it not knowing who he was. I am so sorry now and hope AXS will play it one more time. Tell Mark Cuban to do this. So now I ordered the AXS Motown program and I love it. And waiting for his Favorites concert. How have I missed this treasured person?,1515369600,,353,3.8493150684931505
8000765,2,B0000DD77R,"Very poorly shot, boring choice of a concert.  Of all the stops on this tour that could have better showcased the color of the lights, well mixed sound, and stage design, they chose this dull (in color), flat sound, outdoor show under that ugly tent which takes away from viewing the stage how it was meant.  They should have filmed this in an arena or theater venue.  The SHOW wasn't boring by any means, this was just very boring to watch on DVD...the location and how they filmed it.",1501372800,,486,4.438202247191011

8000768,5,B0000DD77R,I had this concert on Laser Disk back in the early 90's and just loved it. Lost custody of the disk in a divorce but never forgot how great the concert was. This DVD is excellent quality clear video reproduction and great sound. This concert was filmed in Germany during the groups 1990 world tour when he was at the top of his game.,1464652800,,333,4.21875

8000772,1,B0000DD77R,"Unbelievably, I am going to be the first (and probably only) person to write a one-star review of this dvd - and I am/have been a huge Phil Collins fan and a HUGE fan of this video!! Confused? I'll explain. I had the VHS video of Serious Hits Live (and I also had the cd) and it was fantastic.  I loved it and watched it hooked up to my old stereo (with the old huge speakers).  I can still hear the perfect rendition of the Against All Odds theme (Take a Look at me now) with the incredible rasp in Phil's voice at the end of the song as he sat at the huge grand piano -- I can hear him wailing in voice and on drums in the all-out performance of In the Air Tonight -- the showstopping Take me Home -- all of which were performed and accurately/professionally recorded on a HUGE soundstage in DALLAS, TEXAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This DVD (although looking identical in everyway on the cover picture on Amazon) is not that 1990 performance. It is the same tour but filmed in a FRIGGIN' TENT on a hot evening in BERLIN, GERMANY!!!!!!

I have looked for this on DVD on and off for twenty years.  I'd be in a mall somewhere out of state and see a video or music store and give it a shot. No luck - until I thought about it again the other day while researching some music dvds for a home theater setup I am pursuing and searched on Amazon again. ""This is it!!"" I thought. I ordered it for myself for a birthday present and late on the evening of my birthday last week excitedly tore into it and put it into my dvd player after my kids went to bed so me and my wife (who remembers watching the video with me as a teenager) could watch it together again.  When it started you could see the excitement literally drain from my face. COMPARITIVELY, it was just awful. Sounded like crap. Looked like crap. A bunch of sweaty men trying to get through a show. If you like watching 5 different angles of several hundred Germans waving their arms in the air then this DVD is for you.

The original concert filmed in Dallas, Texas is so good that it is worth buying a VCR, cables, and the VHS tape to enjoy. But as it is - I took this DVD out of my player after one and a half songs and threw it to the back of my DVD storage cabinet where it will sadly waste that space.",1446249600,,2252,4.13013698630137
