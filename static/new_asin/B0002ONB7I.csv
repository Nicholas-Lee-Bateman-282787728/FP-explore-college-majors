8029946,5,B0002ONB7I,Captures Luther's theological struggles exceptionally well.  The phyric beat with familiar hymns of the age folded in with period costumes and symbolic representations of the forces at play for Luther and his contemporaries yield a remarkable depiction.,1492473600,,253,5.837837837837838
8029947,5,B0002ONB7I,"this is a fantastic opera! New to me and powerful. The story is complex, starting with his struggle with faith and guilt and going forward, so complex that it bears several viewings to take it all in. I love the setting, and the extras. You haven't heard Luther's ""A Mighty Fortress Is Our God"" until you hear it in this opera.",1445040000,,327,4.377049180327869
8029948,5,B0002ONB7I,"For my birthday I gathered some friends together to watch Kari Tikka's Luther Opera.  Some spoke Finnish and some only English, but the favourable opinion was uniform. Some even went on to either purchase the opera or recommend it to friends.  This is certainly not a 'light opera'. It is based on theology of the Cross rather than Glory theology. Luther's life, just like the Christian's is full of trials, suffering, and disappointment but grace is ever present. The opera is surprisingly contemporary for, as the parallel between the beginning and end of the opera reveal, we deal with the same issues.  The very philosophies that Luther challenged are again loud voices. The device of a chorus as well as the simple staging echo a Greek drama, and the involvement of the audience in singing hymns along with the cast again reinforces that the viewer is part of the drama which is ongoing. Esa Ruutunen who sings the part of Luther has a deep resonant voice, and is a pastor himself. He believes what he is singing and it gives power to his words. The opera contains much beautiful music. The hymns are ancient and would have been familiar to Luther's congregations, and the hymn Armolaulu ""Grace Song"" by Kari Tikka is one of the most beautiful and haunting melodies I have ever heard.",1268956800,3,1289,4.745535714285714
8029949,4,B0002ONB7I,"I wasn't expecting much from the couple reviews I had read. They relegated it to music for the choir. So Luther turned out to be more -  at least for me. It is a work appropriate to church and a festival setting. It is more pageant than opera. We see key scenes from Luther's life. There is little drama between the characters. They instead tend to take poses and sing. On the other hand there is a lot of set pieces and little recitative. The music is modern but melodic and rhythmic. There is an almost constant drum throughout the work. Tikka's influences seem to be the minimalists, but also perhaps Bernstein, Copland, and even Orff. The score incorporates a number of Luther's hymns which are sung by the congregation. These peak with Vom Himmel Hoch which turns into a Christmas scene, and A Mighty Fortress which accompanies Luther's struggle over the death of his daughter. The ending was a little disconcerting. The work had begun with a Dance of Death. That Dance returns in the end. Death swallows up all we do. Luther seems to have been merely a voice crying in the wilderness. I don't know what the official reading is - that is what I got out of it and it seems a little pessimistic for a religious piece. On the other hand it works dramatically. The performance under the composer is all one could wish and the Church of the Rock where the performance takes place contributes powerfully to the atmosphere.",1111449600,7,1421,4.572549019607843
