8176174,5,B000NA6MRW,"I bought this DVD years ago.  Since then, I have bought several other versions, and Peter Brook's production is now my favorite.  As another reviewer pointed out, the minimal staging here enables viewers to focus on the music and the action (there is plenty of it; it is not a static watch-us-sing production).  In my opinion, this one is far better than Kasper Holten's and Francesca Zambello's more recent productions (both at The Royal Opera, both from Opus Arte).  Peter Brook is also more faithful to the libretto than Kasper Holten:  I hate it when the action does not match the sung text (examples in Holten's version:  Don Giovanni telling Donna Elvira that he will not remain standing even if she does not sit -- all the while, he is sitting on the ground; also the talking ""marble"" statue of the Commendatore is a plaster bust that breaks when Don Giovanni throws it down -- ridiculous).",1475798400,,897,4.717948717948718
8176175,1,B000NA6MRW,"I don't have the DVD of 2007 to which everyone has favorably commented. Mine is an audio of 1999, and it is awful. I simply cannot understand Harding's decision to take the opera's pace at such jet stream speeds, the result of which leaves singers exhausted and incapable of interpreting the many nuances of this masterpiece. There is so much drama, so much nuance to this great opera,and it is all lost in the fast and furious pace that Harding seems to have imposed, leaving absolutely no texture, nuance, contemplation at moments clearly called for in the opera. It's as if the champagne aria governs the pace of the rest of the opera. Highly disappointing and a waste of my money!!",1381190400,,685,4.669421487603306
8176176,5,B000NA6MRW,"This is a very unusual production and performance which in turn leads to an equally unusual final result. The key word to describe all of these factors is `intensity'. A good place to start might be to watch the 15 minute interview with director Peter Brook who answers a number of perceptive questions in relevant and justified detail.

Peter Brook has, up to this point, avoided directing operas (of which he clearly has a considerable knowledge) because of the compromises which would normally be imposed upon him by other considerations which would dilute his control relative to that when producing plays. A major condition in taking on this directorship was that all participants (singers, conductor, and orchestra -everybody involved) would be fully committed to a whole year of repeat performances on tour instead of the usual few nights. In the event this production ran for two years worldwide without any major changes to personnel.

Thus was such a familiarity achieved between the participants that he was then able to direct the actual production like a Shakespearian play with enormous concentration on the words and the acting. The props were reduced to minimum on the basis that the words and the acting were sufficient and the opera would also be released from its historical context and thus become a universal statement.

Does this work? The answer is a resounding ""Yes"" which has been reinforced by similar responses supplied by other reviewers. This is without doubt the most involving and dramatic performance of this particular opera, or any other opera one is tempted to add, that collectors are likely to experience. The singers are all of superlative quality and grippingly believable in their respective roles. The lack of scenery actually helps to focus the attention as intended and is artfully moved around to take on new meaning and roles by the singers as required during the action.

All the singers are superb but Peter Mattei must surely have been made for his part as Don Giovanni and he exhibits tremendous vitality throughout which inspires grippingly effective responses from the rest of the cast. Gilles Cachemaille makes for an excellent Leporello to partner him and Nathan Berg adds more weight to the part of Masetto. Equally Mark Padmore is able to infuse Don Ottavio with more resolve than is often the case. The Commendatore is given due gravitas by Gudjon Oskarsson. The two female parts of both Donna Anna and Elvira are sung and acted with considerable energy and drive by Alexandra Deshorties and Lisa Larsson respectively.

Daniel Harding drives the music on with equal dramatic intensity and this concept is fully delivered by the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. The open-air venue is an exciting feature providing a totally black background and the windy conditions whip the hair and clothing to increased dramatic effect. There are also rumbles of thunder to be heard in the background - especially effective during the murder of the Commendatore and the final scene between him and Giovanni. Even the heavens have conspired in the making of this recording it seems!

The camera work is totally effective capturing the final destruction of Giovanni in a convincingly chilling manner. The actual imaging is sharp throughout as indeed is the revealing sound. This is presented in DTS and stereo.

This is a superlative production, performance which has been captured in excellent sound, especially considering the outdoors nature of the recording. It fully deserves the high regard that it is generally held in and therefore deserves to be a serious consideration for all opera collectors.",1341619200,4,3636,5.12141652613828
8176177,4,B000NA6MRW,"I'm always on the lookout for good versions of Don Giovanni, and this minimalist staging is certainly interesting - I got curious about this production after watching a few clips online, and Peter Mattei is certainly my favourite Don Giovanni to date. He's not only a great singer, he's also handsome and charming enough to really convince as this man who everyone's crazy about.

Everyone is really good in this - and I'd like to single out Mireille Delunsch as Donna Elvira, who is amazing in a role that can sometimes be shrill.

One niggle, though: I feel they were rushing through the climactic Commendatore scene; possibly it's more authentic or something, but I like my Commendatore scenes to be slower and much more dramatic!

Still, great performance!",1303689600,4,760,4.921875
8176178,3,B000NA6MRW,"The stage on this production is almost empty and brightly lighted, including in the ""In the shadows"" scene (2nd Act). It almost looks like a rehearsal in a small room intended to make the singers work on their characters as much as possible before going into the full set. Regrettably, the result is not good enough and it doesn't succeed in portraying the characters to their fullest. You have to have a very good imagination, and in essence know the scene well to capture the exchange of clothes between Leporello and Don Giovanni and the disguise that it implies. There are, though, some nice touches like Don Giovanni watching the finale after his departure to hell and suggesting he was finally touched by the people that surrounded him during his life.
The musical aspects are quite good, but not to level of a WOW. I can recommend this DVD only to those curious enough to watch a new staging idea.",1227484800,3,904,4.65625
8176179,5,B000NA6MRW,"Since the moment I first saw  (and heard) this production, I have been waiting and searching the web for a DVD. The singing - every role - is fabulously performed. All of the actors are young, sexy and supremely talented. I was delighted with the minimally staged production as it keeps your eyes and ears where they belong anyway - on the singers and the music.

Owning this DVD is a no brainer for opera lovers everywhere. It is a must buy!",1179705600,20,442,4.378048780487805
8176180,5,B000NA6MRW,"Since the memorable Giulini's version recorded in 1961, I had never heard a so well balanced production of Mozart's best opera. The title role is wonderfully performed by the acclaimed Swedish baritone  Peter Mattei, who has revealed as one of the best gifted Dons in modern times, maybe with the exception of Thomas Hampson. The warmth of his voice and his subtleness to declaim the recitatives reminds us of Eberhard Wchter. His acting is also remarkable: he makes a diabolic Don Giovanni we can not avoid to hate and find irresistible at the same time. Gilles Cachemaille makes a perfect Leporello. Having played the title role before he has an extraordinary capacity to switch roles with the Don, a quality that is hard to find in other singers, maybe with the exception of Ferrucio Furlanetto during the prime of his career. The beautiful French soprano Mireille Delunsch makes a fragile Donna Elvira who makes us believe capable of redeeming the Don. She has recently played Violetta in a recent production of La Traviata by Peter Musbach. The gorgeous Canadian soprano Alexandra Dehorties is also sensational as Donna Anna. With the exception of  Renee Fleming in recent times and Joan Sutherland in the sixties there are very few sopranos capable of facing the arias with the delicacy required for that role. Mark  Padmore is great as Don Ottavio, his way of singing the two famous arias ""Dalla Sua Pace"" and ""Il Mio Tesoro""  can be compared with Luigi Alva in Giulini's version. Lisa Larsson is a delicious Zerlina. Daniel Harding's conduction is superb and so is Peter Brook's production. His mise en scene is minimalistic and quite similar to Deborah Warner's in the 1986 Glyndebourne Festival Opera.

This is definetively a must buy.",1177545600,29,1745,4.962328767123288
