8374442,1,B002MZZSOE,As a fan of Harry Belafonte I bought this DVD thinking that it was a performance but it was a one hour interview. Interesting as it was (HB spoke very open about his background and career) but no singing and I have to look for another DVD by HB.,1302307200,9,245,4.020408163265306
