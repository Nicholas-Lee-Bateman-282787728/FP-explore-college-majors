3561193,5,B001F2APHU,Being as Tracy herself just had a baby she was inspired to make this workout. Her moves are very unique and this workout will leave you feeling like you are really making some changes in your body.,1221523200,5,197,4.351351351351352
3561204,5,B001F2APHU,I absolutely love this work out you feel the results right away it makes you feel empowered it makes you feel like you can keep doing it and Tracy's interview is so genuine and caring and so informative about the exercise routine I am very completely satisfied with it,1479254400,,268,4.489795918367347
3561205,5,B001F2APHU,"This workout is incredibly challenging, but also very effective. I used it 3-4 times a week from 6 weeks to 4 months postpartum and I had amazing results. The first few weeks I could only complete a third of the ab workout. Its really intense in the beginning, and that's ok. Listen to your body, be patient, and allow yourself to work up the endurance to complete the series, it will take time but its worth it. I was fit before my pregnancy, and gained an average amount, my abs and bum looked way better than before I was pregnant at 5 months postpartum. I also breastfed which helped.

There's not a whole lot of instruction, which after time you begin to appreciate. The classical music is lovely. Tracy's tone is uplifting and encouraging.",1479168000,9,745,4.559701492537314
3561206,5,B001F2APHU,Focuses a ton on ab work. This DVD is great - Tracy Anderson is amazing!!!,1477872000,,74,4.0
3561207,5,B001F2APHU,"I have had four children, and am in my early 30s. I have had years where I was really great about working out, and years where I was about as active as a sloth (chasing children counts as a workout, right? ... it turns out, no...). I was wanting to lose weight but wasn't sure how to do it when a friend (who has an amazing body I instantly judged to be genetic perfection) told me she only uses Tracy Anderson. I admit I mentally blew her off- until this autumn.

I picked up this DVD after having my 4th baby, but after reading the reviews on Amazon, I was too frightened to open it. I started with Erin O'Brian's DVD and found it to be PERFECT for me for the first few months. But... I was still too scared of this DVD. (Have you read some of the reviews?! SCARY!)

Finally, baby being 8 months old- I decided it was time to do this. (Okay, okay- it wasn't my baby's age- it was that I had let myself go this summer. I have NEVER been on such a junkfood binge before- and I actually gained more weight over the summer than I had during my pregnancy! WHA!!!??? So I decided to ONLY give up ice cream, and try this video... that was it.)

I opened the DVD, and gave it a fast-forwarded view. And then... put it back in the case.
I told myself I would start the next day...

And, I did.

I huffed. I puffed. I sprawled my body on the floor and panted for dear life. Sweat pouring everywhere, mentally beating myself up over my failure- I just did the best I could (which, honestly, was a few reps of each move - or LESS). My body felt foreign. I felt like I was carrying a load of bricks (the bricks being the unwanted weight!). Even her modifications left me in a heap on the floor. ""I CANT DO THIS!"" I could mentally scream between movements. But I would always follow with, ""I can do hard things"" - I and I just kept trying.

I read an article once about a woman who was trying yoga for the first time. Having been a practitioner of yoga for years, the article appealed to me. In the entry the woman said her instructor gave her some wise advice that changed her whole outlook: Your only job is to breathe. With that in mind, it became how I had to approach this DVD. I told myself I just had to show up, and breathe. Do the best I could, and breathe. That was it. So- my few (at times just one...) reps would have to be good enough. But with that - I finished. YEAH!!!!

After the workout was over, I sluggishly heaved myself all around the room, trying to cool down beyond the DVD cooldown (cardio? not necessary for me- I was huffing and puffing like crazy- my heart was pounding!). I was surprised when Gwyneth Paltrow popped on the screen and started talking about stubborn baby weight. While I walked, I listened- and it shocked me to hear her describe Tracy Anderson's workout as ""by far the hardest thing I had ever done."" Wow, really? Okay- if Gwyneth found this the hardest thing... maybe I need to stop the self loathing and just look at this as a journey instead.

The next day, I was sore in the best way- it was a light muscle soreness that comes with a great workout. But something weird... I looked in the mirror and I looked... different. Is that possible? No way. But... yeah, different, right? Nahhhh... Can't be! My shoulders- are they.. leaner?

I did the DVD again the next day, and I kid you not, I saw results. But not the way I normally see results- in a way I had NEVER seen results before. My shoulders, instead of bulking up and rounding, actually looked as if they were slanting down- giving my neck a longer appearance. My arms, they looked different too. They seemed to lay better on my body (not beefing up my chest, but coming closer instead...).

Backstory: I am 5'11"" and absolutely nothing about me is petite. In fact, I feel quite gigantic. While I have always admired graceful, whimsical, willowy, women I always felt more like a linebacker. I have, as I mentioned earlier, worked out on and off for years- but workouts always seemed to move weight around instead of lose it. I settled on the ""fact"" that my body would always be the body I was used to having, and that if I lost weight I may move down a few sizes but my overall shape wouldn't change much.

I was dead wrong.

I have now been doing this DVD for a month. I have NOT changed my diet other than giving up that ice cream I mentioned (I am nursing and am not going to mess with anything else). I do not do this DVD the 4-6x a week as recommended by Tracy- I do it 2-3x a week. I personally saw results after the first workout, but I didn't believe myself. I couldn't deny the results after workout 2. 1 month later, my clothes fit completely differently. My husband went out of town on business for a week, and he couldn't believe the difference just in the time he was gone.

This works.

I have tried so many other workouts (MLM ones that come with shakes and equipment), fitness plans, diets, lifestyle changes, etc. I have tried calorie counting, step counting, interval training, gym memberships, dance classes, various sports, portion watching, etc. NOTHING works like this. Why? This is actually sculpting my body! This is changing not just weight (in fact, I haven't weighed myself- I don't CARE), it has changed me SIZES. I have gone from 1-2xls to XL in one month, and I have absolutely no weird hanging skin from fast weight loss- it all is fitting where it needs to. I seriously look more like I looked when I was 20! I am so happy with these results!!! One month later and the workouts are still hard, but I now can do the moves (without modifications I cannot do all the reps, but I do my best!) and I find myself looking forward to working out.

YES- this is hard. YES- this is long (47 mins). YES- this absolutely works! Get this for yourself, you deserve it!

3561208,5,B001F2APHU,"Love love this workout and it is great for Abs, best ab workout I've had and could totally tell a difference after baby. It's definitely hard though and I can't do all the moves and I'm a moderately for person. It's almost an hour long which can be tough to do with baby.",1476921600,2,271,4.132075471698113
3561209,5,B001F2APHU,"I didn't purchase this video from amazon, I got it at good will, but I wanted to review it anyway.  I have never had a baby, so I can't review it for post-baby safety.  I think other reviewers have really covered those concerns.  I have worked out my whole life, but never really paid attention to my abs, so they were very weak when I started getting serious about my shape after a 4 month gym hiatus.  I've always done cardio, yoga, and lifting for my arms and legs.  I can really feel my abs now, I can feel how strengthening them has made my whole body stronger.  I couldn't do the ab work in Jillian Michaels or Gilad's videos.  for some crazy reason, I could do this routine.  it's tough and will strengthen your core quickly.  I'm about 40 lbs. overweight, but I can see the nice side lines forming on my stomach.  I've lost about 2 inches off my waist and it's virtually flattened (I carry most of my weight on my hips, my waist has always been on the small side, but never strong).  I am almost 40 years old and had a considerable weight gain and then weight loss that has left me with excess skin.  this hasn't gone away and despite what tracy says, I don't know if it ever will.  but it's getting closer.  I love the way my body feels now, more than I am concerned with how it looks.",1476144000,,1294,4.186234817813765

3561211,2,B001F2APHU,"Would be a great workout eventually post partum. A lot of ab work that I'm sure would help your stomach. Not good at all if you have Diastasis Recti, so if you are considering doing this exercise make sure you resolve that first. Unfortunately, I think for most women this is too intense for immediate post partum exercise. I did it 7 weeks post partum and started bleeding again. I had not been bleeding for at least 2 weeks, was cleared by midwife to work out, and was very active throughout pregnancy. Now I have to wait till bleeding stops for at least a week before I can walk or do very light exercise. I feel like doing this video too soon has ultimately put me behind in my recovery. I will eventually try again once I have fixed Diastasis Recti and am sure my uterus can handle it. I wish I had not done this so soon.",1474070400,,826,4.234177215189874

3561214,3,B001F2APHU,"I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm stuck in the middle on this one. I was on bed rest a lot during my pregnancy so no working out for me. I bought this because of the 'gentle workout' aspect. Yes it is gentle movements, but they are not for women who just had a baby. This workout would have been hard for me before pregnancy! I was hoping for something a little slower paced, with more stretching. With most of the movements she did not give modifications for people who can't quite do a full plank yet, or side hip raises, etc... I had to make up my own for the ones I wasn't ready for, which was most of the dvd. Also, if you are a breastfeeding mom, this was difficult yet again b/c I could feel the soreness with a lot of the movements. Make sure your breasts are completely empty before starting the workout. Lol. I would like to stick with this b/c I can see that it will work, but I need to gain some strength and flexibility back before it will be effective. I may need to start with yoga first.",1468800000,7,1005,4.13265306122449

3561218,5,B001F2APHU,"I love Tracy Anderson...her workouts help me get back into shape with my first pregnancy, so this time around I decided to start with Tracy. So far, so good. The workout is a good balance between not too much too soon and just enough to get your muscles sore but not torture. I will be purchasing the follow up DVD Post Pregnancy II shortly. I highly recommend!",1462924800,,361,4.402985074626866
3561219,1,B001F2APHU,"I am a personal trainer, and I have never learned about ""waking up our abdominal because they have been sleeping"" or ""bringing the skin and the muscle back together."" Those subjects got left out of my course, I suppose.

I purchased this because my son is 1 and although I am a trainer, I need someone pushing me, or a DVD to follow to stay motivated. However, on the first time, a few minutes into the workout, I was laughing! Not only because the moves were hard for me (1 year postpartum) and I couldn't imagine doing this 6 weeks post partum, but because of the things she was saying that were biologically and scientifically inaccurate. I would NEVER have someone who just had a baby do what she was doing. She didn't even touch on Transverse Abdominis Separation which is super important with new mothers. Afterwards I thought, ""why didn't I research who Tracey and what she is all about before I bought this?"" So I did a quick Google search of what some of my favorite credible trainers have to say about her and wasn't surprised they said everything I was already thinking.
 Anyway, it's a silly celebrity trainer DVD, don't waste your money.",1462752000,10,1150,4.577669902912621
3561220,5,B001F2APHU,"This video works wonders!!!! I was super out of shape after three kids. It took me at least a month to be able to do some of the things in this video, but I stuck with it and it was worth it!!!! But if something is too hard, modify and eventually you'll get there!
 I read reviews about people getting hurt, you will if you don't know your limits. Just don't do too much too soon.
The music is great, classical so it's peaceful for the baby
I have bought Tracy's omnicentric now.... Love it. Comes with cardio and muscular structure 30min each. Again took some time like months to make it through but I look great!!!! (Didn't do meal plan just ate better)",1462060800,5,655,4.282258064516129

3561224,5,B001F2APHU,"My wife bought this DVD after having our baby boy. She loved it. Ladies get very anxious over their body after being pregnant but a workout begun too early and too harsh can cause a LOT of damage. I like this DVD because the trainer/ coach constantly expresses the importance of going at each individuals pace and to stop immediately if pain or a blockage is occurring. I think it is very important to keep our girls safety up there rather than getting that stomach back faster than it came. The workout itself is nicely put together and in an appropriate length in time and core strengthening.

Definitely a good baby shower gift for active mommas",1458432000,,648,4.586206896551724

I'm not a huge fan of Tracy's other workout DVDs, but in this one, she's sympathetic to new moms, does a great job giving encouragement, and gives really helpful cues. The music is classical, which is a nice change of pace, and it's a fantastic full-body workout. I ran a lot prior to my first pregnancy, then didn't run for about 9 months (6 months of pregnancy plus 3 months post-partum). When I first went out, I could barely eek out three miles. I did this DVD exclusively for 6 weeks, and the first time I went out again, I ran five miles with no problem.

I was worried it would be as intense as the other workouts, and while it was still difficult to do for a while, it was still helpful in my getting back into shape.

The workout is divided in the 5 sections, warmup, abdominal, legs, and arms--without and with 3 lb weights, and cool down.  Each series is divided into about 5-10 moves, which are easy to manage, or pick and choose if you only have time to complete one section of the workout.  I feel this workout is short enough to make time for a few times a week, while the baby sleeps, as you can complete it about under an hour,  without any baby interruptions that is!

3561246,5,B001F2APHU,"I stayed in shape during my pregnancy. I walked up hill, did yoga and the TA prenatal series. I started this DVD when my son was 6 months. My abs were so sore the next day. There were many points where I had to stop or do fewer reps - and that's totally OK. I also skipped a few of the moves initially because I knew I wasn't ready for them yet. I've been doing it daily for over two months now and I can finally feel my stomach muscles again! Like Tracy says - the muscles are asleep and you have to wake them up. This DVD is challenging even after two months because you start to get more in tune with your body again. I think ever time I do it I feel I get more out of the moves. I had to experiment with positions - one little adjustment and you feel it even more.

* Tips: Leg & Arm sections -- alternate the side you start on each time you do the DVD. I feel like some of the reps/time for each move isn't even on each side. **Think about the muscle you are trying to work and engage it during each rep - that really helps. ***If you can't get through the entire DVD pause it and resume later.",1438732800,,1099,3.90625

3561248,2,B001F2APHU,"Wanted to preface by saying I'm sure her actual classes are fine (I even saw the streaming classes doing cardio, this was just didn't). I'm sure her celeb clients that get one on one workouts are much better.

I'm surprised that this is a popular post pregnancy workout with over 500 reviews and mostly good ones!  She was a NYC dancer and wanted to find a workout that will give mamas tiny dancer bodies - so not big on cardio.  It's 49 min long.  Get Lindsay Brin's Postnatal Slimdown instead! An hour is precious time with a new baby.  I did it and didn't feel like I got much of a workout in.

Cons:
- I found it pretty boring.
- There were no counts/no timing and sections were not split up easily for busy mama like they are in Lindsay Brin's Postnatal DVDs.
- She also doesn't tell you when to switch sides.
- Meant more for mama who has already burned off belly fat.  More for toning. (even her advocate Gwyneth Paltrow says she didn't start till 6 months postpartum)
- There is no cardio!
- Its pretty much all abs
- Her voice is very soft and she doesn't explain things that well
- Dressed like a teeny tiny dancer - some mamas may not want to see after just having  a baby
- Says to do her workout 4-6x a week?! Most videos say alternate days etc

Pros:
- Her room was decorated nice (should this even be added?)
- She had classical music and spoke so softly that you could probably do workout without interrupting sleeping baby

Here's the workout for busy mamas (some are hard to explain, which she also doesn't explain too well):

""Intro"":

I like exercising at home rather than at a club because of privacy and I have the remote control right next to me so that I can pause the dvd just to stop and regroup. Tracy Anderson does this for a living and I don't even pretend that I can keep up with her, but I really like the challenge.

3561259,5,B001F2APHU,"As a former dancer (and being nearly 6 feet tall), I weighed 135 when I got married, got up to 145 just before getting pregnant, and weighed a grand total of 201 pounds at the birth of my baby. That's a LOT of weight to gain over nine months and since getting it back off can take twice as long (if it all comes off at all), I REALLY wanted a workout that would target specific areas and was safe for post pregnancy. I had also read that doing crunches was the worst exercise a mother can do, especially a mother with a diastasis recti. So I was looking for something really safe but really effective.

I ended up with this video, despite the fact that it has some rather intense crunch-style ab work - and it is AMAZING! I VERY carefully worked up from doing just the warm up, to including the first few minutes of ab work, to doing the ab section halfway through and then just moving on to the leg and arm sections. Five months past pregnancy, I still skip around and don't do the entire ab section just because I want to make sure my middle has healed (I had a C-section). But it HAS made a difference, even helping regain muscle control for the bedroom.

Pros: Calm, slow, steady pace
  Raises your heart rate without tiring you out quickly
  Easy to do on the floor with a baby nearby
  Relaxing music in the background and lots of personal-style instruction from Tracy
  Reps rather than fast-pace helps build stability and stamina

Cons: Could be considered unsafe for mothers with diastasis recti (see reviews from other moms for that)
  Isn't intense (for those who like it quick and heart-pounding)
  Is 50-minutes long, meaning if you're a mom with lots of kids it might be hard to do the whole thing
  Is definitely NOT safe for pregnancy - it's a POST pregnancy workout!",1431043200,,1783,4.420245398773006

Some days I find it very soothing and I thoroughly enjoy it,and other days I find it so boring and I turn it off after several minutes! I did buy it when my ""baby""was 10 years old,so I do think the moves may be challenging for someone who recently gave birth,especially if you had a C-section like I did. After my C-section,my ab muscles are still weak,even after all these years. I do love Tracy's abs moves though so I bought this to have in my rotation.

3561269,1,B001F2APHU,"This is a horrible DVD to use postpartum IF you have diastasis recti which is separation of your abdominal muscles.  2 out of 3 women have this after delivering a baby ESPECIALLY if you've had more than one.  For such a common condition to not have this mentioned int he DVD at all is very misleading.  Plus,  pretty much the entire abdominal section of this video is working your recti muscles without isolation of the tranverse ab muscles.  The whole section has so many crunches and other types of ab work which will in fact make the separation WORSE and make you look more and more pregnant.  She talks about doing research while pregnant to make this video but I can't see how much she actually did because its so easy to find better advice, videos and exercises that are safe after pregnancy which include how to tell if you have a diastasis. I can't believe how misleading this DVD is and that fact that it is marketed to a group of women where this will worsen the problem in most people is a downright travesty.  For people looking for better advice, Tracey Mallett's Superfit Mama book teaches you which exercises are safe, the MUTU system (albeit this is expensive) by Wendy Powell if you like DVDS and need a system, or the free set of exercises available on You Tube from momsintofitness.com are much better to use than this.  Also my favorite DVD which is not expensive is the postnatal rescue dvd by Erin O'Brien is fantastic.  The first section, everything is perfect for people with a diastasis and the progression is gradual.  My diastasis has closed significantly already and my baby hasn't even had her one month visit yet. I credit this mostly the postnatal rescue dvd and momsintofitness 8 free exercises on you tube in addition to the exercises available in tracey mallet's book.  I was super excited about the DVD but proceed with caution. I'm glad I had enough knowledge to realize most of this DVD is useless for me at this stage and in fact could worsen a diastasis instead of repairing it.",1425427200,71,2017,4.606145251396648

But it honestly does get easier quickly and you can really feel the improvement. Other big bonuses are that she is not at all obnoxious, the music is low-key classical (a nice respite from the annoying ""pump it"" variety and great if baby is in the room), and her general approach is mature. I found that there is a little bit of a learning curve but once you know the workout it is easy to keep up. I also love that she seems to have a dance background.

Google the term, you'll find a way to check. Doctors will clear you for exercise without checking for it. I jumped into this workout after 6 week PP check up. I did it religiously, really pushing myself more and more each day. I felt myself growing stronger, but my belly just kept protruding more and more, rounder and rounder. I was looking pregnant again.

The exercises on this video will make a diastasis worse. I did a lot of damage to my body with it. Once the damage is done, it's very difficult to heal it. Please beware...there are effective, safer options available. I'm not sure if Tracy is unaware of diastasis recti, or if she just doesn't care, but there should definitely be a disclaimer on this. Seriously, I bet someone will end up suing her.

Not only was it too difficult, but it is hard to follow.  She hardly talks at all, and some of the workouts are too fast to follow, with no instruction of what to do.

She doesn't provide a ton of instruction and I know lots of people take issue with her ""method"" -- but this WORKS. You will absolutely see results. I haven't lost all the baby weight (but I KNOW that it takes a year to put it on, so it takes a year to get it all off, at least for me) but I HAVE lost inches and gained strength and tone, which is what really matters. I would rather my pants fit comfortably and be able to chase after and lift my 3 kids than worry about the number on the scale. She wants you to do this work out 4-6 times a week (to which I say, B PLEASE). But even with my sporadic commitment to it (I probably squeeze it in 1-2 times a week because I just HATE IT while I am doing it, but love how I feel after) and the mix of other videos I like (yoga, Pilates), I DO see results. So if you have a super-human ability to tolerate her saying things like ""it's easy to just have your baby on the floor with you while you do this"", you never need a break for WATER (I mean I'm no dummy, I know she's super fit and all, but they obviously didn't film this thing in one take), AND you can work through some pain (holy muscle fatigue), do it 4-6 times and week and you'll bounce back in no time.",1409616000,9,1360,3.8956834532374103

3561354,4,B001F2APHU,"I don't normally review items, but I was really torn on buying this so I thought I'd give some feed back.  After the birth of my second baby I was pretty certain that I had some abdominal separation.  This is very common and not checked by OB's and post partum women as often as it should be.  I would highly recommend you Google diastasis recti, check yourself for this and try to repair it by exercises on youtube or other videos/programs before doing this video.  It is hard to say what is an okay amount of separation, but once I was back to about 1 finger width I felt comfortable doing this program.  If it is separated too much, any exercises that crunch your abs (this video) will only make that separation worse, leaving you with that mama pouch.

Beyond that cautionary, I would say I really liked this video and would recommend it even for people who are not just getting over a pregnancy.  She has some great exercises that have made a noticeable difference in my butt and legs and my core always feels stronger for a day or two after doing the video.  I exercised a lot throughout pregnancy (5-6 days a week, including lifting 1-2 days a week) and I find this video pretty difficult!  I do not do this every day as she recommends.

It was definitely tough when I first started it and it's A LOT (almost half of the time) of ab work, which stinks after baby, but it's necessary.  It's probably not going to make you drop those post baby pounds magically as it's more toning than cardio, but I do think it helped me get some of my strength and tone back.  I did it roughly every other day for about two-three months before I got bored with it (and I went back to work/my gym at this point) and it did get easier over that time, so I can only think that everything was getting a little tighter and stronger. It's not too long, about 45 minutes, so it was fairly easy for me to squeeze it in during naps or while my baby was in his swing.  A few times I even did it with him propped on his boppy pillow in front of me and he found it rather amusing.",1408320000,2,966,3.9587628865979383

After building up my muscles from pregnancy I moved on to harder workout routines but continued to pull this workout once a week for a while. I used this post-pregnancy #2, c-section #2 with great results. I quickly became pregnant again. Now after pregnancy #3 I feel like my core is better than I was after #2 (no exercise between child 1 and 2). I plan on using this workout again now that I'm released for activity again.

After both my pregnancies, I started using this DVD as much as I could as soon as I could.  My last delivery was a c-section so I put off any ab work until 8 weeks postpartum.  I am not very strict nor do I really have that much time, but I would say I do this DVD about 3 times a week and feel great afterwards.  I like the fact that it is mat work, that there is no annoying music, that she doesn't really talk that much, and that it seems to get more difficult as I get stronger.

I was worried that I might throw out my lower back or injure my abdomen by doing this workout.  Also, why did she keep telling us she gained 60 lbs?

I just could not figure out why I was working out so hard only to still have the belly.  Until someone got me thinking I may have Diastasis recti.  I did a self-test (google it and see if you have it).  I had a 3 finger DR and the abb work out on this DVD was doing nothing to correct it and probably making it worse.  Please check yourself for DR before you do this work out.  If you've had more than 2 full term babies, there is a 2 out of 3 chance you do.

And it's a minor thing, but the lack of rep count of really off putting. With a decent amount of the routine spent on my back, where I can't see the screen very well, verbal counting is important.

It's a longer workout than I can typically dedicate at one time right now (about 45 minutes), so I like to do two of the three sections, plus cool down, and alternate days of what I missed. I like the classical music, and it's nice that Tracy doesn't yammer on like typical instructors. I do think the cool down leaves a bit to be desired. She rushes through the moves and by the time I can get my limbs coordinated to attempt what she's doing, she's onto the next thing and then done altogether.

3561434,5,B001F2APHU,"This DVD helped me SO much after I had my twins. I gained 90lbs and was itching to lose it fast! I waited until my doctor okayed me working out again and started this DVD. I did it anywhere from 3 to 5 times a week, not always doing the entire DVD. They're relatively easy moves, but still challenging enough to get your core back and definition. (Not to mention work on your arms and butt and thighs!) I was back down to my normal size within a year by doing this DVD and walking/progressing to jogging and, of course, eating healthy. Although  my weightloss wasn't as fast as I had hoped, my weight has stayed off and I didn't get any stretch marks, so it was well worth the wait to me!

You have to stay dedicated to it, but it's worth it, I promise! I like that it's not like normal workout DVDs in that she isn't constantly telling you what to do. I would recommend watching it first before you start just so you have an idea. I also like that she does the moves to classical music. It's very relaxing. The first 20 minutes are abdominal workouts and after that it continues onto plank moves, hips/thighs, then standing arms. She does use 2 or 3lbs weights, so I would recommend buying small weights for this DVD, although weight isn't necessary. You'll feel the burn without it!

Yes, people have complained about Tracy's lack of cueing and direction, but once you learn the workouts, it really won't matter because you will know the number of reps per side.

3561455,3,B001F2APHU,"If you have read my reviews you will notice that I begun as Tracy's big fun. Actually at my review for the 30 days bootcamp I've mentioned that I have noticed difference at my posture and also that my clothes felt looser. However there are many ""buts"" I have to mention in general for her method and in particular for this workout, mind you I've tried every single workout of hers (and I mean everything...) and I've never given birth. So I begin with my personal opinion about her method 1) I don't know whether I was doing something wrong but though I was slimmer (no doubt about) my shape never really changed; I mean I'm a classic pearshaped girl, I did her method I was slimmer, I even got that ""v-shape"" abs BUT stayed pearshaped... I don't know about you but this for me it was disappointment though I must admit that her standing abs section did help my posture however nothing miraculous or truly amazing. 2) Perhaps I'm really beginner but I believe that her exercises put body into ""dangerous"" angles and here's what I mean unless you have a well experienced backround in fitness you are in danger of traumatizing yourself. Without guidance you have to be ultracareful when you workout with her during her videos since there are little or no explanations, she keeps high repetitions which she performs rather quickly for the average people. 3) And as for her cardio sections; well they aren't very difficult to learn, but if you have a normal house like mine I can't see how you can jump around. I only found the 30 days bootcamp doable in an average house and that so far my biggest achievement.
As for the specific dvd; I mentioned above I've never been pregnant or given birth but I gave it a try... It's a challenging workout not really suitable for women who just gave birth because it causes great strain at your lower back and even I got a horrible lower back pain (and I have never faced issues like this). We all know that this can even cause cause serious problems to women who gave birth recently as their vertebrae often have larger gaps between them. On the other hand after this I really felt my abs being seriously trained, and (the same as all her dvds) you will shrink if you follow her regimen (not her diet).
My conclusion if you look for a smaller size dress no matter what Tracy and any dvd of her method will do the math for. However if you are like me and you opt not only for size but mainly for a sleek physique, a slender and toned body that will look sexy naked as well into a fancy dress then look elsewhere or just start jogging... Nowadays my favorites are Sylwia Wiesenberg's ""Tonique Premier"" or ""Tonique Mat"" and the absolutely fabulous ""Greg Smithey's The Original Buns of Steel"". Both effective and especially Greg's workout easy to fit in any lifestyle. As for cardio jogging (if you can) or simply walking in a fast pace is enough.
PS If you still want to spice your workout with some of TA Method just add few of her moves (or as I do 15 minutes).",1391731200,,2996,4.449090909090909

3561461,3,B001F2APHU,"I did this one for a while and maybe saw a little bit of result. This might have been more challenging if I had started sooner postpartum, but in started it about a year later. I hurt for about the first week and then didn't feel the burn, so I wasn't sure that it was really working. Maybe there's another video to follow this one, but I decided to just look up exercise moves to do on YouTube. Big props to this movie, though, because Tracy Anderson relates herself to the woes and joys of pregnancy and the postpartum and gives you courage to get yourself back into shape no matter how fat you got during pregnancy. I will continue to be active and work towards a nice body again.",1390089600,,683,4.2615384615384615
3561462,5,B001F2APHU,"Love this workout program! I really enjoy how the mood of the video is calm and she is very patient, but don't let the mood fool you it is definitely a workout and you will see results. Highly recommend to ladies post partum!!",1390003200,,226,4.27906976744186
3561463,4,B001F2APHU,"Great workout, you definitely feel it the next day! But you have to be willing to accept Tracy's training style,  which is not a lot of explanation and going from one exercise to the next without a break:).",1389916800,,206,4.421052631578948
3561464,2,B001F2APHU,"I really wanted to like this workout.  I started it after doing a few weeks of Erin O'Brien's Postnatal Rescue, which I strongly recommend.  For background, I have done lots of pilates in the past, and did Summer Sanders' workout while pregnant.  Second kid, and I'm 37 years old.

I tried this four times in a week (she suggests 4-6 times) and have three main critiques:

1.  My initial reaction is that this is MUCH too hard on the abs for immediate postpartum work.  She says to try it as soon as your doctor clears you for exercise.  I think that for many women, that would be a huge mistake.  Unless you were incredibly fit pre-pregnancy AND had very little distortion of your ab muscles, I think that - unlike Erin's video - this one really doesn't take the time to reteach your muscles, gently, how to work well and comfortably.  I think that I really would have hurt myself if I had done it without doing Erin's first.

2.  The exercises are difficult (which is ok in theory) and get very repetitive and boring (which is not).  So the combination is of exhausting my muscles to where it's uncomfortable, plus being bored.  And, there are very few moves that feel like good restorative stretches.  Overall, I wind up feeling exhausted and hurting, not energized and strong.  Not a great feeling for a workout.

3.  It's too long.  I have a newborn and a toddler and a full-time job (not that raising kids isn't...).  I need something that I can do in 30 minutes or less.  I assume you could click through different parts of this and skip some, but it's so much easier when a video has an ""express"" option that does it for you.  At one point she says you could put your baby (actually she says ""it,"" which is a bit odd) on the floor in front of you while you exercise.  Nice idea for a newborn, not so helpful with the two-year-old around too.

So I'm going back to my old Ana Caban pilates videos.  Love them all.",1389830400,6,1920,4.386363636363637

3561466,4,B001F2APHU,"On the upside: My daughter is 5 months old and I have done this workout 4 times so far. Overall, I think it's a great, well-rounded ab and butt workout, with a small arm section at the end. I have also been running/walking for cardio. I think I will definitely see results and am excited to have found this! I appreciate Tracy's calm demeanor, as I loathe trainers that yell at you to get you ""pumped up"". Also, I can play it while my baby is sleeping since there is no loud music to wake her.

On the downside: in college I had a herniated disk in my lumbar spine, which has not given me problems since (7 years ago). However, if I did not modify many of these ab exercises, I could see the problem returning. You really have to have a strong back to do some of the pike exercises, and especially after having a baby, most of us don't! Use caution and take it slow if you have had a back injury! Also, her cool-down section seems very rushed and complicated to me. I feel I do not get a good stretch in afterward because she switches positions so quickly. So, I just do my own cool-down:)",1389571200,5,1089,4.185714285714286

So when I started this DVD 8 weeks postpartum and felt a weird pain in my pelvic area, I knew I wasn't ready to start these exercises. I waited until I was 4 months postpartum to pick the DVD back up again. And I am so glad I did! During my pregnancy I started having low back pain, and after having my baby it just seemed to get worse every week. I would wake up in the middle of the night unable to fall back to sleep unless I got up and stretched my back. The first time I did this DVD, I felt immediate relief and woke the next morning with barely any pain. Four days/workouts later, I was completely pain free. Other DVDs did not have the same effect, even though they were also strengthening my abs. Something about this workout really does the trick! If I go more than a week without doing this DVD the pain starts to return, so that's motivation enough to stick with it!",1388275200,5,1017,4.064676616915423
3561493,2,B001F2APHU,"I purchased this after using Jillian Michaels DVDs, which worked very well for me.  Complete 180 difference.  There is CLASSICAL music in the background. For the first five minutes I was distracted trying to figure out if it was actually Christmas classical music. No explanation of moves.  It's her laying down and doing a bunch of crunches and their variations, over and over and over and over.  Really.  That's pretty much the whole DVD.  It is so slow.  Who wants a relaxing workout DVD? Why does everything ""pregnancy"" and ""newborn"" related so subdued? I don't get it.

I really don't see how someone who is post baby can do this many crunches in a row, and it's a whole DVD of nothing but crunches. Can we change it up a little? I really wanted to like this video, but it was not at all helpful to me.",1387756800,2,807,4.442176870748299

3561522,4,B001F2APHU,"I will change this to 5 stars if it significantly changes the skin on my stomach. I've needed a tummy tuck after gaining 50 lbs with my first baby (20 years ago) and I want to see if this workout can do anything for my tummy. I think this is too hard for some people several months after having a baby. That said, I found a couple of 8 min segments (legs and arms) from the mat workout on Youtube 8 months ago. I couldn't believe how fatigued I was at first from those short workouts. Little did I know that it was only part of an hour long mat workout. I am now alternating the post-pregnancy and mat workout. They are both very challengingI was I impressed by the change in my arms from the Youtube video's. I am close to getting my upper arms 'back to the skin.' I definitely got my youthful shoulders back and my rear seems much better shaped. My calves are all muscle and look lean instead of chunky. I decided to get the full workout video's and I am not disappointed after 2 weeks.

I am petite and curvy, about the same height at TA. As much as love Kathy S, I know I have a drastically different body type from her. It's encouraging to find a person with a similar body type and now I'm hoping the post pregnancy will make some changes to my tummy. I can definitely 'feel' my abs now. It feels amazing to get it stretched out and active again. I can't really see a change under all the extra skin, but I am going to stick with this for several months. My upper thighs and knees are beginning to look thinner and I can definitely see the difference in jeans. So, instead of just adding 10 min of TA to my other workouts, I have decided to really give the TA method a chance. Don't strain your back on the V-crunches. Understand that you will do less reps and modified moves for a few weeks before trying to go all out! You'll still be huffing and puffing, believe me!

I find the music nice and I think she talks enough. I also think TA is a relaxing personality to follow; a nice change from hyper workouts.",1385510400,2,2016,4.179948586118252

Tracy Anderson dvd does take time so I have to block at least 45 minutes to do this. You do feel a good work out with your arms, thighs and abd.

Nearly every exercise is WRONG for anyone who has the slightest diastasis recti- which many women have after child birth.  I didn't know any better and did this video religiously until I was very fit, except my belly looked even more pregnant than before.  After 2 years of going to doctors to figure out what was wrong my OB said I had such severe diastasis recti that surgery may be my only option.  All cross over abdominal exercises and crunches are the worst for post pregnancy.  I'm now doing the tupler method to correct what this video damaged.  On the flip side, if you've never had a baby- this is a great workout.  Do your research before purchasing this, or you will be sorry!!!",1384214400,17,855,4.691275167785235

She explains the moves pretty clearly, and she isn't all bouncy and cheerleaderish.  I don't find myself cussing her, if that tells you anything! My only disappointments with this DVD are that there aren't ""chapters"" so that you can go directly to the section you want to work on.  The actual workout time is 45 minutes, which is a tad long, but I guess it's necessary to work all the problem areas.  My son scratched my first one, so I actually liked it enough to buy a replacement.",1383955200,,647,4.270491803278689
3561535,4,B001F2APHU,"My sister gave this to me while I was pregnant because I am a fitness buff and couldn't wait to get my body back after baby. I started doing this workout about a week ago and I really think it is working. Many of the advanced ab moves were too hard for me to do at first, but like others have said, they do get easier so obviously the video is doing its job! I was a bit disappointed at first that there wasn't any cardio, but it was a nice refresher to just focus on small movements, especially in the beginning when you are just getting back into things. I hadn't heard of Tracy Anderson before but she is super sweet, understanding, and motivating throughout the workout. My ONLY dislikes with this tape is that 1) she does odd footwork with her arm exercises/cooldown moves, just because she is a dancer by nature, so it was a bit hard for me to follow and I just do my own thing now; 2) the music is classical, which may be a plus for some, but I almost feel like I'm working out in silence since I like music that gets me energized; and 3) I am unable to ""skip"" to different parts of the workout if I want to jump to the arm exercises, for example. It seems that the only designated chapters are the workout and Gwenyth Paltrow's endorsement, so you have to manually fast-forward which isn't too big of a hassle overall. The workout is definitely challenging - especially the butt exercises - but it seems to be pulling everything back together, so I would recommend this to all new mommies (or even those just trying to tone up!).",1383782400,,1537,4.285223367697594

Once you see the results you won't stop!! This DVD works! I gained 45lbs in pregnancy and am back to prepregnancy weight and almost the exact measurements I was before and am 8month post partum just by using this and the matwork DVD plus a few yoga DVDs but I was consistent with hers and walking!

3561540,4,B001F2APHU,"I just got this DVD and I'm already seeing a change! My baby just turned one and I'm battling the last 10lbs I gained during my pregnancy. I started working out right at 6 weeks doing workouts in spurts at home on my own and I have to say that it worked well and I was getting compliments when I returned to work. But I hit a plateau and went through a period of great stress between the summer and fall, which included the death of my father.  In July, joined a gym for the first time in 20 years to try to work through the stressful times, which helped, but I wasn't able to shake the last 10lbs. Last week I decided to go back to working out at home for a while, since it's where I typically get results.

I got this DVD yesterday and did it at night when my kids went to sleep. I don't normally jump right into a DVD, they sit around for a while but I scanned through it and it looked excellent so I said, ""Why not?"" and gave it a try. I felt great while I was doing it and pretty amazing today, much tighter. My jeans fit better, my abs felt pulled in and that motivated me to want to do it again tonight - and I did! It was pretty tough the second time through. I felt the deep muscles ""wake up"" as she says and was pretty sore from last night but I made through the whole thing.

Here are my initial observations and thoughts as someone who has a sizable workout DVD library.

1) Her cues are almost inaudible when you're on your back and switching sides, so it's easy to overdo it on one side. You HAVE to watch her closely and/or turn the volume up!

2) The workout is in sections i.e. warm up, abs, legs, arms, and stretches but the DVD isn't chapterized that way and it's not easy to find the section you want if you have to do 5 minutes here and there with your baby. Kind of a bummer considering that's her audience. But, if you watch it and become familiar with it or do the whole DVD once, you can scan through and find the section you want - not as easy as clicking a labeled section chapter but it can be done.

3) This is an intense workout!! I gave birth a year ago and work out regularly but I found some of the ab moves quite taxing and not great for my lower back. She mentions this but it might be incredibly challenging if you're 6-12 weeks post-partum. So, take it slow ladies and don't risk an injury.

4) Time FLIES!! I have a bunch of other mat workouts: barre, callinetics, pilates, yoga, etc. and they creep by compared to this one. It just really flows nicely and the music is soft but not annoying, that describes Tracy as well. She's very encouraging and she keeps you moving without too much talk. In fact, a bit more description in some places may have helped.

5) The arms section is a bit confusing. Again, this is an issue of not cuing well and not describing the moves while she's doing them. You have to watch her closely and imitate what she's doing. She also does some dance positions with her legs and it's not clear whether they are necessary or if you're only supposed to be focusing on her arms, she doesn't say much here. But, it's only day 2 for me and I feel a lengthening in my neck, arms and shoulders. My shoulders feel more pulled back and down, something I was hoping for, so  I'm pleased!!

6) The stretch section at the end moves WAY too fast. Even if she took one full minute longer overall, it would be better. It feels rushed, and again she's not saying much about her legs and the importance of the dance positions. Just as soon as you copy her and get into the right position, she's on to the next and you don't have time to feel the stretch. Not good. I decided to hold them longer and rewind if I had to catch up. But not everyone with a baby can do this! With all the deep muscle work, stretching is super important.  Seriously, the last thing you want is a calf or leg cramp while your in bed nursing or feeding your baby at night.

7) It's not available in Amazon's instant video (streamed). Overall, I'm very happy I spent the $6.99 for this DVD. But, I wish I could have bought it electronically for streaming, then I could do this workout at my gym where I have guaranteed ""me"" time with onsite daycare. Maybe one day soon.

8) It's worth noting that Tracy admits in the interview portion that she doesn't recommend anything other than cardio with this workout, since she knows that it works and she'd rather you see results doing it her way. This statement will help me let go of some of the weight and cable workouts I do at the gym and keep it simple by doing only this (and probably a bit of yoga) for now.",1382745600,10,4579,4.16045197740113

3561553,1,B001F2APHU,She is so boring and this video is painful to watch. Thankfully I lost all my weight (and then some) from breast feeding so thankfully I didn't actually have to use this DVD. I wouldn't suggest it!!,1382227200,,198,4.378378378378378
3561554,5,B001F2APHU,Amazing. That's all I have to say! It's totally helped after my c-section - must buy for all post preg.!,1382140800,,104,4.25
3561555,2,B001F2APHU,"I chose this rating due to my overall opinion of the product. I chose the DVD because Tracy Anderson is so popular for after baby bodies thought I couldn't go wrong. I was disappointed in the length of the video...I was looking for more. I didn't like how she moved from one exercise to the next. I will however look into her ""current"" DVDs to see if any of this is improved. I do think she is adorable to watch and I love her optimistic views on consumers achieving their body goals!",1381881600,,484,4.271739130434782
3561556,5,B001F2APHU,"Love Tracy Anderson and her workouts. She really helps you trim your butt, abs and arms. I wish the video was shorter but all in all its great,",1381104000,,143,4.142857142857143
3561557,2,B001F2APHU,I thought was too much choreography.i would of like more dancing. Felt too long to teach me the steps so less dancing.,1381104000,,118,4.409090909090909
3561558,5,B001F2APHU,"i haven't made it through the whole video yet (hard to find the time with a newborn) but i did the first half of it and was sore, in a good way, the next day.  the tummy workout involves a lot of crossing your center.  for example crunches where you meet your elbow with the opposite knee, etc.  i look forward to getting my tummy in shape.",1380758400,,340,4.044776119402985
3561559,4,B001F2APHU,I like the different workouts there is but it is very difficult to do after having a baby. I did this when I hit 5 weeks pp and I found it very difficult. I did different prego workouts while pregnant to stay in shape and found this hard. I couldn't even do some of the workouts and was sore for 3 days. Also I wish this workout involved more legs and so forth. It focus's a lot on abs which sucks! lol,1380672000,,402,3.9146341463414633
3561560,4,B001F2APHU,I love working out with tracy!! She really knows what we want and need!!! I got my body back after my first pregnancy and I can't wait to start working with the pregnancy proyect!! I have the metamorfosis work out series and I had great results!!! No more gyms or crazy workouts for me!!!,1380672000,,288,4.351851851851852
3561571,1,B001F2APHU,"I bought this product because of the amazing reviews, but was disappointed on what a lousy coach.... Tracy is. I don't get the hype. She mumbles and I can't understand her directions. I can see how the moves can actually help your body get back in shape, but I need a motivator. Tracy is not one!!!",1380153600,,298,4.339285714285714
3561572,5,B001F2APHU,I didn't know what to expect from this DVD but I really like it- It is definitely challenging though!! I had my baby in July and am trying to get back my stomach which is hard!! I didn't know if I would make it through the whole DVD the first time because I was definitely out of shape after the baby- but I pushed through it!,1379894400,,326,3.9545454545454546
3561573,5,B001F2APHU,This workout is amazing! She shows you alternatives to use until your body is strong enough to do the workout full force! I do this everyday!,1379808000,,141,4.461538461538462
3561574,5,B001F2APHU,"This video is hard even though the steps are very simple.  I have a 2 month old and had a c-section.  I was not in the best of shape before I got pregnant but was overall very healthy.  This video is hard but even going at my own pace the next day I was very sore, which I like.  I will be keeping up with the video and hope to see results in the next few months.",1379808000,,363,3.675324675324675
3561575,5,B001F2APHU,"After reading reviews, I was wary... thinking it may stress my lower back too much or something. And, yes, this IS a hard dvd. But I didn't work out before or during my pregnancy, so I expected that! She kinda seems to expect your arms to have some strength, which mine totally don't. So plank stuff etc and arm stuff are extra hard for me. But I just 'cheat' some when its too hard. Then it gets easier and you can start mimicing her moves more and more. Like I'll put my knees down if a full plank is just not happening. After doing this video at least every other day for a few weeks, I was almost able to do everything she did, but yeah not as well so still room to improve for sure. Then I started work and I'm not starting into this again after a break... and its back to square one with having to cheat again. Anyway, like with any dvd... don't push yourself past your limits... I know when something is too stressing on my back or will make my arms ache too much the next day to hold my baby... so I play it safe and do things a bit slower if needed. Better to get some exercise than none at all, eh?

p.s. I'm using this to tone... only way I've ever lost weight is through my diet and I've lost the weight this time in 3 months... last pregnancy took longer but I gained more then. I'm not saying the dvd helped me lose. Just helping tone I hope!",1379289600,2,1356,4.059701492537314
3561576,4,B001F2APHU,Watched the video as I'm still in pregnancy and it looks like it will be beneficial to get body back,1379030400,,100,4.05
3561577,3,B001F2APHU,"I felt like I walked in on Tracy working out and she just happened to say, ""Oh hey, come work out with me"". She doesn't count, doesn't tell you when to move to the next exercise, doesn't describe the next exercise, and DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE ARM SEQUENCE! It's like, some weird form of slow, gypsy dancing.

That being said, I was really working hard throughout the whole DVD, when I did manage to figure out what exercise she was doing. I'm going to stick with it, because I've seen the great results that my friends have gotten. I just wish Tracey ""owned"" this routine more as an instructor.",1379030400,,603,4.383928571428571
3561578,2,B001F2APHU,Not my type of workout video seemed to slow cuz music sucked in my opinion and I'm use to work out videos telling u when u r done doing an exercise or when ur going into another cuz sometimes I can't look at the screen when I'm doing an exercise ... This just isn't for me and everyone said it was pretty easy it's not I found a lot of things hard to do and she didn't give to many beginner alternatives,1378684800,,403,3.926829268292683
3561579,5,B001F2APHU,I love it! This helped me get through my first trimester so far and helped decrease my nausea and increased my energy. Highly recommend it.,1378684800,,139,4.6
3561580,2,B001F2APHU,Now don't get me wrong- you will get a good abd workout BUT Tracy is not good at giving you directions during the exercises. With some of the positions I was not able to look at the screen and when I did check out the TV she had moved onto a different move. It was very frustrating for me. I have already resold my dvd!,1378598400,,319,3.923076923076923
3561601,5,B001F2APHU,i love her mellow video. also i love that it concentrates on abs after pregnancy. i feel sore every time i do the video and have lost inches to prove it works. there is no yelling and no one else to watch but her. great.,1378425600,,220,3.911111111111111
3561602,5,B001F2APHU,"I love this DVD. I did Tracy's Pregnancy Method, which was perfect each month. The only downfall of this post pregnancy DVD is the difficulty level. I tried it 7 weeks post partum and it was a struggle. 30 minutes of abs were killer. I know you have to start somewhere, but if you are easily disheartened, don't try this until you have eased back into your fitness routine. After a week of yoga and 4 weeks of bootcamp, I can complete the DVD and still feel challenged.",1378339200,,469,4.340909090909091
3561603,5,B001F2APHU,"Either you will love this dvd or hate this dvd.  I love it!  I've lost all my weight from my 2nd baby, but my stomach needed some extra help.  This video really challenges me,  but I love it.  I haven't seen any results yet because it's been only about 2 weeks, but I can't imagine not having good results considering the intensity of the ab exercises.",1377820800,,352,4.2727272727272725
3561604,1,B001F2APHU,"Hard to follow. Vey choppy, no flow to the lesson. Found the moves difficult for a beginner. Would not recommend. Better off with a basic Yoga video.",1377561600,3,149,4.555555555555555
3561605,3,B001F2APHU,"I would recommend it, it seems to work if you like to work out watching a video. Her technique may work but not for me. I waste more time trying to do her movements the right way, so i would not hurt myself. Her technique it is pretty unique.",1377129600,,242,3.9591836734693877
3561606,5,B001F2APHU,"I encourage all to buy this DVD as part of their post pregnancy must have! It really works, do as much as you can in the beginning and soon you will be surprised how strong your body gets again and you will be able to do all of DVD in a couple of months.",1376352000,,254,3.7222222222222223
3561607,1,B001F2APHU,I was told this was ok for those who are not post-pregnancy but I disagree.  It has a lot of information pertaining to pregnancy,1376352000,,128,4.333333333333333
3561608,3,B001F2APHU,"first off, let me say that you MUST be strong enough to easily do progression 3 in erin o'brien's postnatal rescue before you attempt this dvd. this is in no way an early postpartum workout unless you were engaging in very strenuous exercise while you were pregnant. if you're like most of us and your core is total s*** postpartum, there's no way you can do a lot of these exercises.

on one hand, this dvd is a great workout. it's been two days since i did it for the first time and my abs still feel sore! however, there are a lot of negatives, IMO:
-45 minutes long is absolutely ridiculous for someone with an infant. at least break this up into chapters so when you inevitably need to go tend to your child, you can easily return later. i would prefer three separate arm, leg/butt, and ab workouts. when tracy says you should do this 4-6 days a week i want to laugh in her face. does she not remember what having a newborn/infant is like?
-after doing erin o'brien's postnatal rescue, tracy's lack of cuing is that much more obvious and annoying. a lot of moves you aren't facing the tv, perhaps you're turned to the side or facing down. tracy doesn't actually mention when she's moved on to something else until she's maybe a few movements in, if even that, and she mumbles. by the time you look at the tv, she's long since moved on to something else..annoying.
-lack of modifications. occasionally she'll say ""oh, you may not be able to do this yet.."" but rarely does she consistently offer modifications, or demonstrate them herself. if this is billed as an early postpartum dvd, which is the impression i got from tracy's monologue at the beginning, you NEED to do that.
-tracy constantly yapping about how she gained sixty pounds OMG. sure that's more than the recommended weight gain, but she acts like that made her totally disgusting and that turns me off. you need to be gentle to yourself postpartum and i thought that was annoying. sometimes you can't help the weight that you gain..that's just what your body needs.

i'll keep doing it as i can, since it is a great workout, but it'll have to be an early morning or weekend workout for me since it's seemingly impossible to do with your little one around.

UPDATE: 8/25/13
i know there has been criticism of tracy's methods, but i have to say, this DVD really works. my lower abs, while they're not at their pre-pregnancy state yet, have definitely gotten noticeably flatter and stronger in just a few weeks of doing this DVD.

in case it helps other busy moms out there, here is the order/timing of each section in case you want to skip around:
4:00 crunches
11:19 crunches with weights
13:40 piking series (oof..this is still really hard for me 3 months postpartum!)
19:23 side planks, planks
28:27 kneeling leg series, butt lifts
38:09 arm series",1376092800,27,2817,4.572277227722772
3561609,4,B001F2APHU,Its more of an ab work out. If you are looking to work out legs and arms then look for her first map work out dvd.,1376006400,,114,3.423076923076923
3561610,4,B001F2APHU,"This DVD is a good buy. The exercises are challenging and you definitely feel the burn the next day. My only complaint is that Tracy isn't the best at talking you through the video... You really have to watch the whole time because she'll switch sides or switch to an entirely new move without giving a cue. There are times I'll be focused on a move and then look up to see she's not doing that move anymore. But other than that, it's a really great (but long) workout. Tracy covers two series of ab/core work, one leg/butt series, and a quick but effective arm series at the end.",1375660800,,580,4.330275229357798
3561621,1,B001F2APHU,"After I got my doctor's okay to do exercise at my 6-week post-partum checkup, I ordered this DVD. It is extremely difficult but I toughed it out. My reward? A prolapse in my pelvic region requiring at least 8 weeks of physical therapy. My PT told me these exercises are not appropriate for a post-partum mother - and I'm seeing other evidence pointing that this DVD's exercises are not safe for new mothers too:

[...]

I am filled with regret over having purchased this DVD. Please don't make the mistake I did. Talk to a pelvic floor specialist and get evaluated before going through this workout. If I had any idea of the risks before I never would have risked this!",1375660800,74,669,4.520661157024794
3561622,5,B001F2APHU,"Getting your body back ( the belly!!!!) is tough especially when you had a C-section and have not exercised seriously for years...So I really recommend this DVD, I started seeing results after two weeks of exercise and I feel great each time I finish it, it's challenging but you can adapt to your own rhythm. I am really thankful to TA, I am just motivated again!!!!",1375228800,2,367,4.575757575757576
3561623,2,B001F2APHU,"While Tracy certainly has a great story, she does not deliver the goods with this workout. My main complaint is her lack of instruction - she rarely gives any insight into proper exercise positioning. Occasionally she will say watch closely, but that just leaves you staring at the screen trying to determine how your various body parts should be placed. Working out, especially post pregnancy, can lead to serious injury if not done properly so this is a cardinal sin for me. Every other at home DVD I have spends time on this for every exercise.

I am also not a fan of the setting - when I work out I am not looking for a serene, calm environment with classical music in the background.

If done properly, it's a fine workout, but I can't look past its faults.",1375142400,,763,4.482014388489208

When you start, you kind of wonder whether or not you're going to get anything out of the workout, but by the end you definitely feel it.  By the time you complete the workout, there is no question as to the fact that you have, indeed, just about killed your abs.  I stopped using the DVD due to time constraints, but look to start up again to see if I can get noticeable results.  Will update this post when I do/do not see those results.",1374969600,,607,4.153846153846154

This is the first time I have tried to do a Tracy Anderson workout and I chose it because of the ratings on it and the fact that a lot of women seem to have seen results.  However, upon starting this workout with 2 sisters who have not been pregnant previously, we could not seem to follow through with the workout.  Firstly, Tracy does not explain how to do the exercise clearly.  She does it and expects you to follow it.  Neither does she tell you how many of them you're going to do (like most exercise videos and my previous personal trainer) or how many you have left to do.  Secondly, her exercise moves are extremely difficult to do!  I'm assuming this video is for people who have previously done her other workouts and are now trying to lose weight post pregnancy.  I am extremely disappointed and frustrated as it made me feel unfit and incapable even though I have been working out with a trainer and using DVD's for 10 years.",1374969600,12,1031,4.278350515463917

I can NOT stress enough...if your beginning then do NOT buy this one!",1374624000,,325,4.015384615384615
3561629,2,B001F2APHU,"Hi there
Gosh I don't ever write reviews just cause I don't bother...so I can't believe I am doing this: but I felt I just had to let women know how unpleasant and a waste of money this was for me!
I gained 40 lbs with my first son: and was desperate to lose the weight as all women are after giving birth.
I am deff. an athletic woman, with a vigorous athletic background before my pregnancy.

Before my first pregnancy I did pole classes for 3 years, ran 3 miles jog every day and am an adamant walker with my husband in the evenings...not to mention a big fan of Jillian Michaels from the Biggest Loser, and I do her videos on a regular basis! I think i've proven the fact that I know what working your Butt-off- to-the-extreme  means!

I was so shocked while trying this workout how completely uncomfortable it is to do these routines...
I have already after giving birth...gone back to Pole classes and started Jogging and bought Jillian Michaels 30 day shred, and have been losing 13lbs and feeling great!!!
At my 13th lb, I thought to get this workout cause I still have a bit of stubborn tummy bulge. Even with all the core exercises I have in my regiment from pole, Tracy's workout is ridiculously painful and uncomfortable to do! ...and she expects  non athletic women to enjoy this?!!?

I'm 5'6.5 and 167 lbs currently... before pregnancy I was 140 lbs.
Tracy says she is 5' tall in this DVD so of coarse its easy for her to do practically 25 minutes workout of her abs straight through with out having to much of a hard time lifting her petite tight body...but us very recent post pregnancy women who are currently overweight have major difficulties doing such a workout!!!!

Do your self a favor and skip this workout dvd because its not fun! and working out should be fun! either wise you'll never want to do it at all.
She doesn't even change up the routines in literally is like 20 runs of lifting both legs from the ground and doing abs while dying and being totally bored! Tracy doesn't break a sweat! good for her now can we lose the weight in a fun efficient manner please!
Save your money!!
And try Jillian Michaels she'll wake up your muscles and your mind at the same time... unlike Tracy who puts you to sleep and hurts you!",1374624000,,2248,4.404819277108434

3561652,4,B001F2APHU,I bought the Tracy Anderson post pregnancy DVD to tighten my midsection! I have used it a few times and so far it seems to be a great workout for toneing up!

I am recovering from pregnancy and have no stomach muscles and have to continually pause, rewind video to keep up. I also wish there were chapters to skip to say the arm workouts, or the leg exercises. Instead I have to fast forward to those parts because I still can not do most of the ab exercises. I have had lower back issues in the past, and with no abdominal muscles - I wish she would break down the exercises in stages. I'll see in a year what my shape will look like with this workout.",1373932800,2,559,4.283018867924528

There is alot of ab work on the floor and she dosen't count or speak loudly so sometimes it's hard to keep track of changes.  I appreciated the mellow classical music instead of techno pumping beats.  You can feel a difference in a few days so I believe it works, but don't go into it thinking you can get all these moves and do the whole thing unless you've been working out. Also I wish she would have put some modification moves as alternatives until you can work your way up to the real move.",1373241600,2,572,4.327102803738318

This dvd is perfect for people like me who are waaaaay out of shape, as well as people who would like to tone certain trouble areas.  This 1 hour video is very relaxing with classical music, ballet-inspired figures and very controlled movements.  You can put any pace of music in the background (just be sure keep looking because sometimes she forgets to mention its time to switch sides).  You will definitely feel a burn in your arms, stomach and thighs/butt.  I do hope that after some months my body is as femininely fit as hers! P.S. Don't be thwarted by the advanced moves.

3561657,2,B001F2APHU,"The workout is good but a bit hard for a beginner and it gets boring to do the same routine day after day. As many other reviewers have already noted, Anderson barely provides any instruction so you really have to memorize the the workout if you want to have continuity. The music is not ideal for a workout and I would say it is better for practicing yoga or meditation. I also thought that the disc would have more than just one routine so if you are expecting to change routines from day to day then don't get this disc. Another thing I didn't really like was the interview with Gwyneth Paltrow at the end of the disc. I don't really care what she has to say about the workout. I would have liked to have another routine added instead of waisting space with this interview.",1373155200,3,776,4.321917808219178
3561658,2,B001F2APHU,"Well, I'm sure this is a great, effective workout if done regularly but I think Tracey is just a bit out of touch with who would be doing this workout. I'm not an advanced exerciser but I'm not a weenie either and I couldn't do a lot of these exercises BEFORE I got pregnant so I definitely can't do them with my weak after baby belly. I could probably work my way up to getting through this workout but I just don't have the patience. I was kind of offended that she recommends this for older clients or beginners. She doesn't offer much cueing or modifications for her exercises. I feel like I'm just watching the pretty girl workout. It's just not my style I guess.",1373068800,,668,4.309523809523809
3561659,3,B001F2APHU,"Although this workout dvd has nice classical music and a pleasant setting, the editing and instructor leave a little to be desired.

Here are some pros:  The ab portion is the best part and the focus of this dvd and it provides some good moves to get things 'back to the skin.' I have a pretty extensive collection of workouts, and some of the ab moves were new to me and worked pretty well. The leg routine was decent but all on the floor on hands and knees so be sure you are on a padded surface. This is an easy workout to begin to get the muscles back in shape.

And the cons:  You'd think that a woman who caters to A-listers like Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow could afford to hire a person who knows how to edit and transition workout segments better. For example, it's ok to show the instructor stumble or miss-step or have to climb awkwardly to her feet rather than white-out the screen; Jillian Micheals and Chalene Johnson do it all the time and they laugh it off as being human. Plus, it would give us mere mortals time to transition from the floor to standing routines. Also, in the cool-down, there is a horrible cut-job in mid move. Speaking of the cool-down, does anyone else feel like she was just making it up as it was being filmed? The entire arm section, with and without weights, felt the same way. While she did the ab sections in a detailed manner that I appreciated, the other sections, especially the arms, were lacking in instructions, focus on form, and muscle knowledge; if she learned anything in 10 years of research, she didn't appear to want to tell you about it. If you aren't looking at the screen in some parts, you completely miss that she has changed positions, all while she says that it is *very *important to pay attention to what her arms are doing. No cue, no clue. Then she goes on to say that women should never lift more than 3lb weights, and she repeats that in multiple interviews, as well, which infuriates me every time she says that since I'd already completed Chalene Xtreme, which is all about responsible weight-lifting. I guess she just seems so smug and judgmental every time I hear her say it. Btw, Chalene Johnson is probably my favorite female instructor for workouts; she knows the anatomy and physiology, she's perky, funny, personable, and talks science to me. I've seen some of Tracy's other workouts and they are similarly cue-less and talk-less. Some of Jillian Michaels early workouts were awkward, too, so maybe this is just something Tracy can learn and change as she produces more videos.",1372723200,,2554,4.557734204793029

Not sure how much the arms moves actually do for you.  The leg moves are also pretty effective.  She says to do it daily but I don't think I could do these moves every day without getting a little bored and I do think you should get some variety.",1372118400,,527,4.326530612244898

I don't know if it's the exercises or breast feeding that helped me lose weight, but I gave birth in December, and six month later, I feel good and confident about my body.

First time I tried it was 8 weeks after giving birth, it was to difficult for me. I then tried again two months later, and gradually, I am mastering the exercises. It's still difficult, some more than others, but I feel the difference, and I've actually recommended the work out to some of my friends, who didn't give birth.",1371772800,2,659,4.401639344262295

Even so, after doing this once, my midsection felt like it had been run over by a train the next day, so it must be doing something.  But I really don't like her failure to cue the exercises - it comes across as sort of arrogant, and is irritating.  Other friends who use her say the same - they all dislike her teaching, but find the routine pretty effective.",1370649600,6,680,4.424

It targets abs/obliques very well and arms, legs/butt effectively. I have Brooke Burke's videos, Jillian Michaels, Ellen Barrett and Lindsay Brinn ... I also run 3-4x a week and do Zumba 1x a week. This video is the most effective video/workout I have tried yet, I've only done 2 days and I was so sore this morning I could hardly roll over to turn off my alarm. It's not THAT tough (considering I do workout often) doing the video because it's a lot of mat work, but you will most definitely feel the effects the following day. I have not been this sore doing a video the day after since I started exercising again and I LIKE it. I'm going to continue this at least 4x a week and plan on making this my now #1 go to video for my workouts. Tracy Anderson does not disappoint!",1370390400,2,1048,4.218905472636816

3561695,4,B001F2APHU,"Let me start by saying I think Tracy is an evil genius and I have come to love this workout. It really works! However, in my opinion it's definitely NOT a good post-pregnancy workout. In the DVD, Tracy says to start this routine as soon as your doctor gives you the okay to workout (usually 6 weeks post partum). I can't imagine doing this workout 6 weeks after my C-section or even 12 weeks. The moves are VERY challenging. I started this workout 6 months post partum and still have a hard time with some of the exercises",1369267200,7,522,4.336734693877551

After doing this DVD workout twice, I have already recommended it to all of my pregnant friends! Tracy takes you through a gentle but also tough (and long) ab section, and you can really feel it working right away! Abs are, after all, the most important place to start tightening after that baby bump! I feel like she really knows what she is talking about and that doing this series of exercises is targeting the exact areas I need to work on right now. She also includes great workouts for your legs and glutes, as well as a nice arm workout. You need a mat and 3 lb weights for this workout, but its easy to set-up wherever you have room in your house. My only hiccup is how quickly she moves between movements in the arm workout and cool down stretch. She doesn't really explain what she's doing or when she's going to switch moves, but I'm sure that after I do it a few more times, I will catch on.

Definitely a MUST BUY if you want a targeted, strategic, and do-able but challenging workout after baby!",1369267200,,1146,4.40566037735849

There are a lot of errors like that, but it took me two times to do the video and I got the hang of it. You really do see a difference in your abs and hips. I feel like it's a great low impact full body workout. I do it 2-3 times a week and I saw results by week 3. I do like how she explains that she gained weight with her pregnancy and doesn't make you feel like you have to do it all the first time around. I do spend most of the video talking out loud to the tv at how much I hate her, it makes the workout much more bearable.",1369008000,4,687,3.6802721088435373

3561711,5,B001F2APHU,"I am really enjoying the ab work out! If you are experienced with pilates mat work or have danced, you will like Tracy's style. She doesn't cue a lot, or teach form. If you know the intent of the move, you will work on your own form.  Otherwise, if you want to work on correct form or her to be a personal trainer, this is not the right DVD. I do the video in the morning before baby wakes or at night right after baby is asleep.  It takes 30-35 minutes.  I get a good sweat going and my core feels and looks tighter everyday.

But by my 4th time popping in the video I was able to go 20 minutes... then 30...  and that's where I'm at right now. The workout is about an hour long. It's a great workout and I'm definitely getting stronger and seeing results.  I have NO idea how post pregnancy women are supposed to do this unless they already exerised before their belly got big.  Because my abs felt like they were going to fall out of my body 15 minutes in the first time I did the tape.  I like that it's challenging so that I can learn more each time I put the DVD in rather than getting bored too fast with it.

Many woman, myself included, develop rectus diastasis due to pregnancy esp multiple pregnancies and most of the exercises Tracy does actually worsens this condition.  It causes your front abdominals to bulge and no amount of crunches or planks will fix that.  In fact, crunches and planks will cause further damage.  If you have developed this condition the only way to bring your abs back together is to work on your TVA muscles and obliques.  I used this video for about a month and noticed my condition was worse and never used it again...so it was a waste of money for me.",1367366400,11,710,4.595238095238095

3561716,3,B001F2APHU,"This is a 45 minute Pilates-based workout that is pitched as a postnatal workout.  I have mixed feelings about this one.  The workout is fairly tough and thoroughly targets the abs, core, butt, and arms.  If you worked out your entire pregnancy and maintained core strength, this is hard but doable.  If you stopped exercising or were not active during pregnancy, this might be one to work up to.  One of the cons of this workout is modifications are given for only some of the exercises. I would also only recommend this workout to someone who is familiar with Pilates because instruction on proper form and technique is absent from the vast majority of the exercises.  For example, she makes a comment about how you can strain your back if you don't activate your leg but she doesn't explain what it means to activate your leg.  Since correct form is essential for maximizing results and avoiding injury, the absence of instruction is a definite negative here.  Most of the shooting is done head on, so you can't rely on multiple camera angles to help you get the moves right.  Also, this is targeted as a postnatal workout that is very abs and core focused yet she doesn't really discuss diastasis and which exercises should be modified or avoided if someone has diastasis. Another negative is the absence of cueing.  She often does not say when a set is completed or when it is time to switch sides.  This is a problem for exercises when proper form entails looking at the ground and not the screen.

Pros:
Tough and comprehensive workout for core, abs, butt, and arms.  Will firm and tone these areas.

Cons:
Poor instruction regarding form.

Few modifications for beginners.

Little to no cueing.

Makes odd comments like ""get the skin to come back to the muscle"". If your skin is not attached to your muscle, you need professional medical intervention.  She also hints that this can help with spot reduction of fat in certain areas.  Not happening.

I'm currently 10 wks post-partum, started doing it exactly 4 wks ago (6 days/wk) and have seen absolutely amazing results. I actually lost 30 lbs 2 wks after I had my baby but I knew that the last 20 lbs would be on me to lose! In the past I've done Insanity, Zumba, yoga, & right before I got pregnant I was training for a 1/2 marathon & I have never done a workout that worked so well. 2 1/2 wks into doing the DVD I had already lost a full pants size and the inches have continued to melt away. Tracy says with her method you should also do cardio but I haven't done any. I don't have time! It's enough doing a 46 min workout with a 10 wk old! And it's not a normal day if I don't have to stop at least once to breastfeed him :)
I've read complaints that she doesn't give enough verbal direction but after doing it a few times you get used to it. Now it's hard to remember that it seemed that way at first! I've also had to modify almost every exercise and work my way up to doing it fully. She doesn't always include a modification or an easy enough one so I kind of made up my own. (For ex. on the pikes where you're extending both legs parallel to the ground I put my hands underneath my lower back, palms down, to do the move to strengthen those muscles) I've just focused on strengthening my core and using it the entire time. If you do the moves exactly like she does you notice she's using her core in every single move, even the arms. I love that! My skin is coming right back to the muscle like she says & I feel healthy & strong again which is what's most important to me.

3561724,3,B001F2APHU,"I just had a baby 10wks ago and Im just starting to get out on the workout-sceen again. This is my 3rd baby and I got back in pretty good shape after nr2, how ever it took me FOREVER (it felt like). But once I got into it I was a total gym-rat! I kept up my workout routine pretty well for the first couple of months of pregnancy, but got more and more tired and restrained as my belly was growing bigger. The last 10wks I wasn't allowed to workout due to early contractions and those 10wks totally blew me off the fitness ladder. For the last 3-4wks Ive been trying to start up my workout routine again and it totally feels like Im starting from scratch (uuggh!). Ive been doing Jillian Michaels dvds, cardio at the gym and some zumba and yoga. Got this video after reading some reviews. Received it in the mail yesterday and just finished my fist workout 5mins ago.

These are my first impressions:

Pros:
- HAAAARD. This is HARD and you can feel your abs W O R K I N G! Yeay, thats what we want!
- Its pretty long (47min), but it doesnt feel that long. The movements have a great flow and all of a sudden the workout is over.
- Tracy, she is beautiful and a great motivator.

Cons
- HAAAARD. Yes, this is also a con. The workout is supposed to be designed for mothers who just had a baby, I probably wouldnt be able to do all the movements perfectly even before I got pregnant and was in tip-top shape. It could be discouraging to someone who's never worked out before.
- The music. Its like a christmas concert and kinda annoying.
- The instructions. Tracy doesnt give very clear instructions so you have to pay attention to your screen so you don't miss when she switches sides or movements. I also wish she would count some of the movements. Like 'only 3 more'.. or something so you know you're getting closer to being done. lol.

Im gonna keep using the video a couple of times a week and Ill write an update when Ive used it more, but so far I think its pretty good :)",1365292800,,1976,4.192105263157894
3561725,2,B001F2APHU,"i thought I would love this workout but having just tried it I must say Tracy Anderson does not have very much charisma. this workout does not offer modifications or even count downs when she is doing the workout. I had no idea how many reps to do, also it isn't a ""typical"" workout video where the person is talking to you, she basically says very little and the music is very ""yoga""-if you like that kind of thing, this is for you. I need something more upbeat. Also, as a new mom, many of the moves were way too advanced-like a side plank-at this point in my fitness. She didn't really offer much in the way of modifications for those of us not ready for the advanced techniques.",1364947200,,682,4.294573643410852
3561726,5,B001F2APHU,"I had my second baby 10 months ago and have always been very active.  Before my son was born I went to various classes at my gym. I did weight lifting, body barre, spinning, cardio challeng , and Pilates . I loved attending classes and have had great results. However my son did not do well in the child care at the gym and sadly I had to give up the majority of my classes.
  I started jogging and lifting weights on my own instead and gained five pounds! This lead me to start looking for fitness DVDs in hopes of replacing my beloved gym class.
  I have seen Tracy Anderson on tv and in magazines as the go- to trainer of the stars and decided to give this a try! Thank god I did! This DVD is great for toning and I started to see definition in my abs after two weeks. I jog and alternate this DVD with her mat workout 5 days a week.

I noticed a difference after only a few times of completing it. Right now, I'm pairing it with running and a HIIT DVD workout. I'm not super fond of Tracy Anderson, but she's not overly annoying. I was worried I wouldn't like the classical music in the background, as I'm used to something more upbeat. But, I really enjoy it. It's a good change of pace, almost relaxing by making you feel good about what you're doing. Tracy spends the first 28 minutes of this 47 minute workout targeting your abs, then moves to legs and glutes for 10 minutes and arms for maybe 5. There is a short cool down at the end and a short warm-up in the beginning. It does target abs more than anything else, but I still felt my arms and legs working during the ab workout. I also felt sore the next day, so she must be working your arms and legs somehow! I think pairing it with other strength workouts and something with cardio would help. As other reviewers have said, Tracy does not cue well. But, after a few times I knew what was coming and felt like I could follow along better. It's also a great price for a workout DVD, so I say go for it and good luck!",1364860800,,1276,4.276859504132231

I felt tired and unmotivated to workout but this video is intense if you can give yourself time to learn the techniques you will feel your muscles working. She does explain that at first you may not feel it working but give it time and you will definitely feel those muscles again! I usually do not like workout videos but Tracy Anderson does an amazing job of directing you and putting you at ease to take your time to build up to the full workout!
  I read some of these lower rated reviews and they are right that this Tracy Anderson video does not have the fun dancing music in the background but I feel the softer music works for this type of a mat workout. She does have a dance cardio workout if that's what you are looking for.
  And for those you get a bad disc or do not receive your video you really need to contact amazon not Tracy Anderson bc you did not order it from her site so she has no control over it.

3561744,5,B001F2APHU,I had my son a year ago. I lost most of my 60lb baby weight within a couple of months. then I decided to diet and unfortunately I gained all the weight back plus extra 12lbs. I thought diets were supposed to do the opposite. I gained the weight so fast and I was desperate to lose it. I'Ve never heard of Tracy before but as soon as I saw post pregnancy on the DVD I purchased it without thinking twice and I'm glad I did. my muscles were dead nOt asleep. it took three days to awaken them. I've lost 2'' off my waist and my abs are looking great. it is hard work but if u are motivated u'll see amazing results,1363564800,,611,3.935483870967742

I would consider this video to be Advanced. She does moves that I probably wouldn't be able to do a year post-paartum. I was really disappointed. I actually am doing other workouts and building up strength so that I can DO this video. So in my opinion, a little misleading.",1361491200,5,425,4.195121951219512

The moves are very difficult and i can see how someone may get hurt if they attempted these too soon after having their baby. That being said, I love this workout. it definitely worked for me. I t is a bit long so everytime i get through it i feel so accomplished lol. Take your time getting through it and pair it with a form of cardio for optimal results, but even by itself i saw incredible results within the first three days. worth buying and the price is perfect.",1361491200,2,579,4.225225225225225

Tracy doesn't ""count"" and doesn't provide much direction at all.  The music is also terrible - not at all motivating - I think it's orchestral music.  So, I put her on mute (since there's no direction anyway), and put on a fun playlist of my own.  I would recommend this to any woman who wants to rebuild and define muscles after pregnancy.",1361491200,,474,4.340909090909091
3561773,5,B001F2APHU,"I bought this DVD shortly after I had my son, but put off trying it until he was about 11 months old. I was lucky about losing weight post pregnancy. I nursed for three months and took four months off for maternity leave, during which I walked 2-3 miles every day with my son and did yoga at home. By the time my son was 5 months old I was able to wear my entire pre-pregnancy wardrobe. BUT, once I returned to work I became complacent about exercising and was so exhausted between working full time, wanting to spend ever free second I could with my son (working mom's guilt), and trying to squeeze in house work after my son went to bed at night.

Let's just say that by the time my son was 9 months old, I began putting weight back on. Wake-up call! I knew this DVD would be challenging and would pick it up, look at it, and put it back down. Finally, when my son was 11 months, I tried it and it was as challenging as I thought it would be. My abs were sore for about three days after my first attempt. And, it was hard for me to do the ab exercises and had to modify some (using Tracy's excellent suggestions). I realized though, I needed sore abs! It was a small price to pay to tone up and get my muscles working again. Since then I've been doing this DVD faithfully three times per week and using our treadmill three to four times per week. I'm making time for myself to exercise and it's paying off. After only 1.5 weeks of using the DVD my husband said he could see and feel a difference in my abs. Most importantly though I felt better. It didn't take long for me to be able to do all (except one that I still modify and that's OK!) of the ab exercise the way Tracy does them.

The leg and arm exercises are also challenging, but both my my legs and arms are stronger and much more toned!

This DVD is a bit of an investment but worth every penny! And, I agree with every reviewer - post-pregnancy or not, this is a great exercise DVD for any woman.

I also like the fact that the setting and music for the DVD are elegant and understated. It helps to make the DVD ""timeless"" so that you could pull it out again in 5 years and it shouldn't seem dated. Another quality that makes this DVD a good investment.",1361232000,14,2217,4.113163972286374
3561774,4,B001F2APHU,This workout is my fave. I absolutely love the way it goes up in intensity and targets the whole body. I dread the leg part because it hurts so much! LOL but that means it works.

It was difficult. I am sure it will be perfect for post-pregnancy. I really love the way Tracey is in her video's.

Most of the exerises and positions should not be done until at LEAST 4 months postpardum.  A new mom is more likely to become injured from completing this exercise DVD 4-6 times a weeks as suggested than to get back into shape and be motivated to do so.

There is so much wrong with this DVD....from lack of instruction, motivation, commentary, timed segments.  Just don't buy it!  And if this DVD is still appealing to you, please wait a reasonable amount of months before executing the techniques shown.

I'm a 29 year old mom of 2 kids (9 and 7)
I hated work out because never got what I expected from workouts
been a Latin women  I may say I have curvy body and exercise ALWAYS
bulk me and made me quit and frustrate me in disappointment , I'm 5.2 and  been around  130 pounds ( on my worst times)
people never consider me fat, my issue was that I wanted a lean firm body and I never even dream to not only loose 10 pounds in 6 week but get firmer, and firmer on a point that my abs look awesome!!! it's hard work you will suffer A LOT but girl's its worth it

3561784,5,B001F2APHU,"The description on the back of the case mentions it being a ""gentle"" workout for after a baby... This makes me a little scared of her other workouts!!

It is pretty long for an ab workout - just short of an hour. I only managed under 20 minutes on my first attempt, but I kept it running to preview the rest of it to see what hell I was in for later in the week. No individual move seemed terribly challenging on its own but the hegh reps of each and the sequencing adds up to some serious punishment.

Prior to pregnancy I had a number of injuries to my lower back so I had zero core strength, despite years of personal training. I just couldn't switch those muscles back on or find them in my mind, if you know what I mean. But after my first go at this workout, I've been able to engage my core muscles and can also feel them with my hands when exercising. Quite exciting!

I'm used to working out with heavy weights, and doing low reps of exercises for large muscle groups. This style of training is the complete opposite so it was a bit to get my head around at first. I noticed that she talks a bit about getting tiny and getting skinny arms etc. I used to be really skinny til my late 20's so previous training was about developing a stronger looking shape. Since my pregnancy, I put on an enormous amount of weight (40kg/80lbs) so I guess my goal is to get ""tiny"", though this kind of thing normally makes me cringe (usually cos I hear it from 19 year olds who still haven't filled out).

She doesn't really give a lot of cues but you really should count along in your head - I learned that when doing personal training. Otherwise you're just drifitng along. It's also handy as otherwise you get that thing where your mind does the dialogue along with her cos you can't help but memorise it after a week of continuous viewing!

I also bought the Lindsay Brin Core Firing Sequence Method DVD when I bought this one, and given it has 3 progressive workouts of around 8 minutes each that are meant to be remedial, I have decided to stick to that for the next month til I have a base level of core strength to work with. Then I'll go back to Tracy, ready to really step things up. The next day I felt aching muscles and saw my belly wasn't ""hanging"" quite so much. This gave me a huge buzz and lots of hope that I really can get back into shape without thrashing myself at the gym 6 days a week. The only other exercise I do is a 30-60 minute walk most days.

I think that if you had a reasonable level of fitness throughout your pregnancy, you'd love this DVD. She claims that her method helps the belly skin to reconnect to the muscle so it doesn't sag. Who wouldn't love that?!  But if you had poor core strength before, or if you had diastasis recti in pregnancy, maybe get the Lindsay Brin CFS dvd and start with that for a few weeks. She's a bit less glam but is a great instructor with a crazy 6 pack.  Good luck!",1355356800,4,2924,4.181172291296625
3561785,2,B001F2APHU,"In my opinion, I say we all get together and give Tracy Anderson a medal for loosing the 60lbs she keeps talking about having gained from her baby... and then let's send her straight to a train-the-trainer class.

Perhaps I've been spoiled by the old-school greats like Denise Austin (blast from the past, right?), Billy Blanks, Mari Windsor, and - my recent favorite - Chalene Johnson who actually LEAD their videos.  Throughout this DVD, I found myself annoyed and frustrated by the amount of times I had to rewind to catch up with her when she changed directions, or legs, or motions without telling me and when she did... it was almost as if she was talking to herself!  I felt like she was just humoring me by letting me watch her workout.

Counting to 10 or 12 or 20 always bored me when I attempted to endure the tedium of Tony Horton workouts - but at least he still made me feel like he was in the room with me.  Tracy Anderson, barely acknowledges we exist.  She shares no indication of repetition length, no insight into what we are working or even how to do the moves - in fact she uses ballet terms for just about everything with no explanation for the layman. She gives no real direction at all, rather we should just watch and follow her... yet more than 1/2 of the mat routine is done with the viewers head facing the ceiling or the floor.  And yet she encourages us to workout with the baby in the room?!  I had to pay closer attention to HER than my baby... as if my baby would even stay still that long for me to get through the whole long50 minute routine.

PS... I'd love a picture of Tracy with the pregnancy weight she keeps bragging about losing... talk is cheap.",1355184000,9,1687,4.364217252396166

I couldn't even make it through the first time, but you just have to remember to do what you can and not expect too much. Take it slow.

It would be impossible to watch my baby while working out  (as suggested by Tracy in the video) because you really have to constantly be looking at the video in order to follow along.

I agree with the other reviews that its not just for people who are post pregnancy, this is definitely a killer ab workout.

3561841,5,B001F2APHU,"After having my second baby, the fat would not come off. Certainly not as easily as it did after my first. When my baby was 4 months old I decided to take action and see if this video would really work. I measured myself every day and kept a log of my workouts. After just 2 weeks, doing this video 5 days a week, I lost 1 inch on my waist, 1/8"" on each thigh, 1/8"" off my upper arm and 1/2"" off my hips. By week 6, I lost 2 inches on my waist, 1/4"" off each thigh, 1/4"" off my upper arm, and 1 1/2"" off my hips. Being 5'2"", the loss of inches really shows.

My only other workout has simply been keeping house. I treat housework as cardio by literally running around vacuuming, picking up, etc.

Now it's been 16 weeks and I've lost a total of 5"" off my waist, 1 1/4"" off each thigh, 1"" off each arm, and 2 1/2"" off my hips. I'm only 2 inches away from my pre-babies body. If I continue, I'll be there in 6 weeks.

Like anything, you just have to continue without worry. The log has really helped me see that it's actually working.

3561842,3,B001F2APHU,"I bought this work out video after my first pregnancy. Truth be told it was frustrating to do because I just was not flexible after 6 weeks to do many of what was expected of me. I gave up and never finished it. I ended up losing the weight anyway and on my own slowly and by the end of the first year I was back to my old shape. I knew the second pregnancy wouldn't be as easy so I started this video again six weeks post-part. This is whAt I have been noticing. I am more flexible and at ease with the routins now. While the Routins do work your body parts and you would feel it the next day (good thing) the instructors doesn't not tell u when to switch sides. So if you a not watching the video while working, which is hard to do, you would miss switching the routine from left to right and v. V.  The video also doesn't count your moves, so you never know how many reps on each side. If you have ever taken a class of any sort of work out, you will not like the lack of direction in this video.",1341100800,,999,3.9211822660098523
3561843,2,B001F2APHU,This is not worth the $70 price tag. It's a decent ab workout but that's it- and it's grows boring very quickly.,1340755200,,112,4.136363636363637
3561844,4,B001F2APHU,"I must warn you this is a very tough workout. I had a repeat c-section and started this workout at week 16 postpartum and was not able to perform some of the movements as well as she demonstrated. Tracy does not play around. There is no water breaks and you will hardly see any modifications for any of the challeging movements in the routine; however, I find the workout to be very effective. So far, I have successfully completed 3 weeks of 5 consecutive days of training. I dropped two pounds and I am able to see my ribs and a well defined waist line. The workout runs about 50 minutes. It starts off with a brief warm up followed by an extensive ab series, which was very tough to master in the first week. After the ab workout she moves on to the leg series where she seems to pay close attention to the hips. Then she moves on to the butt-lifts which is not too hard and it feels good after having working the legs and hips so rigorously. She finishs off with a two section arm workout. Honestly, after having worked so hard in the previous sections, my arms are ready to give up, but she is so enocuraging and uplifting that makes me want to keep going till the end. This is the beginning of week 4 for me and I still haven't quite mastered the arm series yet. The first set of the arm workout consist of somewhat transitions. She is very meticulous and theatrical with the movements and transitions. My arms are burning even before it's time to work them with the weight. She reccomends 3 pound weight, but I just find it more tolerable with a 2.
Finally, I am giving 4 star because I feel I now need to be doing something else. To me, in order for this to be a 5 star it would have to have another phase or routine. After a while, doing the same thing everyday gets a little tedious and predictable. I like workouts that keep me on the edge and excites me about the next day. This is probably the best woman workout there is and I would say the best workout for any woman condition, not just postnatal becuase it works to solve many troubling areas, but, personally, I need something different to look forward to. I am starting to get bored with the routine.",1340582400,3,2168,4.2773722627737225
3561845,2,B001F2APHU,"The content of this workout is great, which is why it's such a disappointment that it is in one long segment.  As a new mom, it's hard to find time to work out; sometimes I have to break up my workout into several sessions throughout the day.  This is really difficult to do when the dvd is one long 50 minute chapter.  The idea of fast forwarding to find where I left off can be a reason not to go back to the workout.  Naps can be so short.  I don't want to waste time finding where I left off; I'd rather choose another video that has chapters.
Also, she gives very little direction and her voice is not very loud at times, making it hard to follow.",1339200000,6,652,4.0625
3561846,5,B001F2APHU,"I highly recommend this DVD post-partum or not. This has helped me get my pre-baby body back, and has given me the strongest abs I've ever had. It is super hard at first (at least post-partum when your abs are shot), but if you stick with it the results are awesome. The more consistent you are with the workout, the faster you see results. I always feel like I can see results within days as it slowly nips in the waist and tones the belly. I'm super impressed and have recommended this DVD to many of my girl friends (none have actually had babies) and they swear by Tracy as well. This technically isn't cardio, but get ready to sweat! She knows what she is doing and this is the best find ever!!",1337731200,12,699,4.2631578947368425
3561847,4,B001F2APHU,"As my previous review of her mat work illustrates- I have my criticisms and praises of Tracy Anderson. Last summer while living in a rural village in Eurasia, DVD's at home were my only opportunity for exercise, and in many cases entertainment. I have a poochy belly and am at the size 8 body frame- 5'3 and often at 125 to 130ish pounds whenever I have weight to lose. I did her method last summer for 7 weeks, mat and cardio and had such little results with the exception of my arms. I got bored out of my mind and really wish that I had my hands on this video earlier to alternate with her mat to avoid boredom. If I used this video, perhaps my abs would have been better. It just might be one of the best ab workouts on the market.

 Unfortunately I am not the best reviewer for this DVD in many ways due to my shoulder injury that I had last autumn and it was right around the time that I started this video, so I have no long term results to report. Seven weeks of the mat, did not do so much. I was only able to do this video a few times before my injury and I still cannot do it nowadays due to my shoulder. But, I still think that others should give it a shot- I think I was on to something when I started this DVD. My abs were very sore and I loved the setting and the classical music. I do not think this video was so boring and the setting was very motivating. I did start to see and feel some results in a short time. So I advise to purchase this video over her mat work if you have post baby weight and/or some belly fat. And my personal advise is to use Tracy in your rotations of DVD's but do not follow her method to the tee if you get bored easily- again her method gave me little results. If I was not so injured today- I would rotate this DVD with her cardio (which does burn alot of fat) and some other DVD's that interest me such as Yoga Booty Ballet, Zumba, and Ministry of Sound. Do what works best for you and do not hold yourself hostage to only the Tracy Anderson method. I am aprehensive to spend so much money on her new and expensive DVDs, I will stick to the one's I already have and the webisodes, which are free.",1335657600,,2145,4.009345794392523

I was super excited to find a post pregnancy one ( I had my baby 7 weeks ago) Last week was finally the week that I got to try this DVD. I find that she does know what she is talking about but the DVD is rather boring. I put it on and follow it as best as I can but I find myself counting the seconds for it to finish. I don't think she is bad so please don't get me wrong. I just think I should be able to find an ab workout a little more upbeat. It really doesn't help me that I have to listen to ""elevator"" music all through out!",1330473600,2,594,3.6484375

I read and heard all good comments about this dvd so I bought it and tried it for 3 months but nothing happened to my protruding belly after two kids i got separation in my transverse abs so fix it first if you have this condition because I can't even explain it to you how frustrated I feel that I wasted all my 3 months doing this for 40 mins in hope ok give it time, give it time and give it time.... it might be good for those whose tranverse abs are already joined together. So, I'm going to try different excercises now like stability ball for abs and other transverse strengthining excercises now first and if they come close and I feel them hard together again who know when then I will think about giving this dvd a try...hmmm gosh so dissapointed!!",1330387200,8,807,4.281045751633987
3561850,4,B001F2APHU,"i bought this dvd at some one or two weeks postpartum, and up until my son turned five months old i didn't really have that much time to use it. i used it occasionally starting at six weeks post partum, but it was so difficult to find 45 to 50 whole minutes at any one time to actually do it. so the dvd just sort of sat around for a couple of months.. and when my son turned a little older and i started to have more time, i was able to start running again (i was a runner pre pregnancy). unfortunately, running didn't tighten the tummy area like it did the rest of my body, so i remembered this dvd and took it out. i use it now mostly as a core workout to supplement my reclaimed running routine, so i'd use only the sections i want: the abs, the pikes (abs), and the arms, because i still don't have time to do the whole dvd. and, wow! i can feel it! i have no idea if it's actually reducing inches off of my waist, but i feel my abs tightening again. it's pretty difficult.. there is a particular routine in the pike series that sort of hurts my lower back, but Tracy offers an alternative. i like the fact that Tracy doesn't talk too much.. i know it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but i prefer her style of just doing things without over explaining them.",1327190400,,1264,4.06

I have combined it with about 25 minutes of cardio dance 2 to 3 days a week and am not really dieting.  This is tough but some of the moves you have to build up to which is good-if you could do all of the moves easily it wouldn't be working.

They were way too tough and it was easy to give up, but I saved it for later. For reference, I had only done sparse college class workouts about twice a week after having him and only prenatal yoga during my pregnancy. Now it's later and I pulled the video off the shelf. I can finish the video doing the easiest versions with fewer and fewer breaks as I've been doing it.

Even my husband said it looked like my stomach was getting ""ripped"".  :-  I have also lost 3 lbs in 8 days.  Been eating healthy, but not dieting  So I am in love with the tracy anderson method.  If you are new to working out and don't really know your body than maybe this isn't for you.  But I love that there is not much cuing and LOVE LOVE LOVE the music.

I only do the first 20-25 minutes, which is abs & butt, because the rest of the dvd (legs & arms) is rather short & pretty useless, if you ask me. I DO use Tracy's Mat Workout dvd for an arm workout, because her arm workout is the best arms workout I have done, ever. If you get anything from my review, understand that this dvd is worth the money for the abs & butt section alone. I did use this dvd to help ease back into working out after having my third child, & it is very good for that, especially the light leg & arm work at the end, but the ab work is & has always been fairly difficult, which I love.

3561886,5,B001F2APHU,"Since others have already summarized I'll just say I'm a happy customer. I used Tracy's DVD 2-3 days a week along with jogging 2-3 days a week, and a healthy diet. I started in May 2011 and have lost 25 pounds since then. My baby was born Nov 2010. Obviously I can't say what would have happened if I *only* used Tracy's DVD, but mainly I wanted to incorporate cardio as well.
The minimal talking is great plus if you're using this DVD often. The music is the background is nice (Bizet's Carmen) but it's soft enough that I can turn the volume low and play my own music, while still hearing Tracy's voice.
Several of the moves are difficult and pilates type. I worked my way up to some of them. Others I still have to downgrade a bit. Regardless, my body is tone and stronger than before I was pregnant. I still got the results I wanted. This video would be difficult even if you didn't just have a baby which is a good thing in my opinion.
You do quite a few reps of each move. The point is to do these moves slow and controlled. You are very purposefully moving your body, and paying attention to position. Tracy does give some reminders how how to position your body. I almost feel elegant while I'm working out!
Tracy is pretty mellow, which is exactly what I need. This is a calm but brutal workout!",1315440000,5,1304,4.283400809716599
3561887,4,B001F2APHU,This workout was great. Abs and core are definitely the focus here but every part of the body gets a good workout. The only negative I really have is the cueing. Tracy is great but she speaks very softly through much of the routine and only throws a cue out every now and then. If you are new to the routine then you have to watch the T.V. the entire time just to know when to stop one thing and go onto the next. There are no counts done for you. I think the routine might be pretty tough for a woman who just gave birth but Tracy does offer alternate ways of doing some of the exercises.,1314921600,,589,4.0
3561888,2,B001F2APHU,"After giving birth, I was having a hard time finding the time to get to the gym and, living in the Los Angeles area, I am very familiar with Tracy Anderson and her celebrity clientele. I'd heard very good things about her workouts. I'd worked with trainers prior to becoming pregnant, so exercising/core/resistance training are nothing new for me. That being said, I am somewhat disappointed with this DVD.

Anderson does not give quality direction in this video, often leaving the viewer to guess how many repetitions/sets there are from one move to the next. She also doesn't prepare the viewer to MOVE from one set to the next ... making me wonder how she could forget that the viewer, in this case, is someone who just had a baby and moving quickly from one position to the next will take a tad bit more effort than someone who has full use of their abs and other muscles. Seriously, there's no segue between most of her moves.

I've been working out to this video once a week for the past two months, in combination with circuit training at home, and I'm still annoyed with it mid-routine. Anderson doesn't seem to have the basics down pat -- such as COUNTING the repetitions. It's a guessing game for the viewer. She's oddly quiet throughout most of the workout. That and the creepy circus-like ballet music in the background -- it's not very motivational. She doesn't work arms very much and even at that, the repetitions are odd -- sometimes you do 2 counts, sometimes 5 on one arm, 4 on the next, 7, 8 or 9. It's a bit random.

This video could use a reboot: get better background music, pump up the direction to motivate viewers and keep them in the loop of what's next, etc., and get the repetitions down to a consistent count. The DVD jacket itself doesn't even tell you how LONG the workout is (I think it's maybe 45 minutes?) and doesn't prep you ahead of time for what's to come ... such as, you need 3 pound weights. These are very simple marketing techniques. The workout itself is fine (although many of the moves I learned when I was a teenager going to Bally's Womens Gym in the late-80s);I just find myself getting frustrated mid-workout due to the lack of direction and random rep count. It lacks in structure and, overall, isn't worth the high price of the DVD.",1313539200,8,2284,4.52542372881356

Over the years I have seen and tried many different videos and this one blows them all away. Do not mistake this is a SERIOUS workout, especially if you just had a baby recently. However, I have  to say even after just a few times it really will transform your body if you stick with it. I agree with another reviewer who said this could be great for ANY woman baby or not. She really knows a woman's body and her dance background really makes it feel graceful and elegant even while you are sweating :).

If I had to choose between the two, I'd pick the Post-Pregnancy DVD as my favorite. It had an awesome abs section as well as legs, arms and butt. The Mat Method had really great legs and arms but the abs section wasn't very long. This isn't a cardio DVD. I really recommend you try it!",1311292800,2,539,4.1923076923076925

3561916,5,B001F2APHU,"This is great! First, those who say there are no directions may need more guidance than I do. I found the level of instruction to be just what I needed without getting too 'talky' and annoying. I am pretty turned off by instructors who put out lots of 'personality' and constantly talk. Tracy Anderson just says what needs to be said and does the rest. (I did notice that there's a command where you can turn her voice off. Maybe some have done that inadvertently?)

Same with the music. As a former dancer, I found that the classical music took me back to the barre. It was so relaxing to not have the music get in the way of my ability to focus on my muscles and what I was doing. It was easier to get 'internal' with it...much like one does in yoga...to work harder and more consciously. I'd love to see more workout videos with classical music. That said, if Anderson were to remix this video, I might choose a different piece in a couple of places. Some of the more Wagnerian bits seemed to not fit.

The exercises are fantastic. I have never been pregnant...but got this because I wanted to focus on my midsection. In just a couple of weeks I'm seeing a difference in not just my abs, but also my butt and arms. This is hard, but worth every bit of effort.

PS - it seems that some think that the positive reviews are written by friends of Tracy Anderson's. For the record, I don't know her, and only recently heard of her when I made a 'mistake' on YouTube. A happy mistake, as it turned out!",1305849600,7,1499,4.289752650176679
3561917,4,B001F2APHU,"I bought this DVD because I needed to get the pounds off after giving birth.  Make no mistake about it, this is a TOUGH routine and  requires a lot of patience and time.  After giving birth, your muscles are weak and so this will help to build strength.  I learned that it is OK not to get through the whole DVD for the 1st month or so.  But in time, my body got stronger and I was able to complete the workout.  Be careful though, there isn't much coaching on technique so I would advise new moms to watch the DVD at least twice all the way through and take note of how she does certain moves.  This will avoid injury and improper technique.  But overall, I love this DVD.  I was really motivated to master the workout and get stronger and slimmer.  It works, stick with it!  Side note: If you like high impact workouts like kickboxing, spinning, etc, then this is not for you.  She is really laid back in this DVD and there's classical music playing in the background.

I don't agree that it is harder than the Mat DVD though.  It is tougher on the abs but the Mat is a tougher workout overall.  I often add one of her webisodes at the end since this DVD is only 40 minutes.  Great workout and unique moves.  I plan to order metamorphisis once I get sick of this workout.  I don't do Tracy's cardio since I am a very healthy eater and am not looking to lose weight...I walk my dogs everyday for an hour and that is all I do for cardio... but I may start doing the cardio eventually...

The only CON I have is ironically I would not recommend this DVD for women who just gave birth.  I would recommend a post-natal STOTT Pilates video first and then work your way up to this.  I am a Certified Pilates Instructor so this DVD is not that hard for me...BUT there is no way any of my post-natal cllients could do this DVD immediately after childbirth.  You need to start with pelvic tilts and moves that don't involve lifting your head right away.... so start with something more basic and then once that is easy work your way to this.  This DVD should really have 2 levels...The first level for immediate post-natal women and the actual workout should be for once you have gotten some strength back.",1303171200,9,1392,4.19172932330827

I like that there is classical music in the background and I like how much my abs hurt after this work out BUT Beware the bad form!

Her original Mat Workout DVD actually changed my life... not to mention my lean yet totally noodly and undefined runner's body. I've heard mixed things about the Perfect design series and I am NOT willing to shell out $90 for the Metamorphosis set (which includes a dance cardio DVD, and I LOATHE dance cardio and will never ever EVER spend a penny on it), but I decided to take the plunge and check this out.

Hands down, this is the best abdominal workout currently on the market. I am not exaggerating. My core strength has improved enormously since starting barre workouts months ago, but this completely kicked my ass (well, abs). I've borrowed the notorious P90X Ab Ripper DVD from my boyfriend a handful of times, and this is definitely more challenging.

The ab exercises in this DVD are COMPLETELY different from those offered in the Mat DVD, not to mention that you're spending over twice as long working your core than you are in the Mat DVD. The exercises are remarkable in their range. Some are very small and focused, whereas others are much more dynamic and even involve other muscle groups; often you'll find yourself getting a fantastic leg workout by proxy of the insane moves offered up by Tracy!

The only thing that sort of bothered me about this DVD was the lack of a weighted arm sequence. As a runner, my arms tend to be my least toned feature, and it really gets my goat when I finish a workout without really feeling like I'm targeting my problem area. However, there are some great resources online for getting your Tracy arm workout fix; just check out Youtube for her arm webisode, and for an additional 10 minutes you can squeeze in a FANTASTIC arm set. On other days when I want to switch things up, I'll just skip ahead in my Mat workout DVD to the arms series and just do that.

Also, I'd be doing the producers a real disservice if I didn't talk about how lovely this DVD is in presentation. It's shot in the day as opposed to dusk (which always kind of bummed me out in her Mat DVD) in Gwyneth Paltrow's Hamptons house, and Tracy is in front of a cozy pile of pillows instead of the stark wall. What I REALLY love about this workout is how it's set to classical music instead of the standard workout pop fare; it makes for a really great and relaxing change of pace during one of the hardest workouts out there.

Moral of the story: if you like the comprehensive Mat DVD but want to find something a little more targeted, buy this. It's challenging, effective, beautiful, and a pleasure to do.",1300406400,16,2710,4.545081967213115
3561936,5,B001F2APHU,"After having 4 beautiful boys (last pregnancy -which was 6 mos ago- being twins), I thought I won't be motivated by any work-out videos in the market until I heard of Tracy. I find this video extremely challenging but fun to do. Just don't try to overdo it the first time or else your sleeping muscles will scream at you. I've just had it for a week, but I already feel my tummy folds slowly tightening. Amazing! Hopefully, I will lose the last 20 lbs of extra weight gain in the next month or so. By the way, I noticed this work-out has combined Pilates and ballet movements (the gal is graceful when she moves/changes positions) that make the exercise really engaging, too. She may not give you a cue when it's time to do a different routine but that's ok for me since it gives me just enough freedom to do/continue with a position. I can easily catch up on the next move anyway. Over-all, highly recommended work-out regimen! I think I've become a Tracy Anderson fan already.",1299456000,,978,4.4692737430167595
3561937,5,B001F2APHU,"...and I'm loving this workout!  You do get results.  You do have to work hard.  I'm noticing that the stronger I'm becoming, the harder the workout is because I can really focus on the muscle groups being worked and push them further.  I love the ab segment.  In  many exercise videos the abs come last, but I like working them first.  And this series targets your muscles in so many different ways: crunches, pikes, planks, and  side.  I cannot believe that after SEVENTEEN years, I'm seeing the baby belly begin to tighten up.  Amazing.  Unlike the mat workout dvd, the legwork is performed on your hands and knees.  I like this as well because it engages my pectorals.  The arm segment is not as challenging as the mat workout dvd, but for my level of fitness, it's perfect because I can focus on form which is so important for the results you want.  And, when it gets too easy, I'm planning on doing that segment twice. All in all, I'm quite pleased. I've been working out every other day, On my rest day, I'm sore, but it's the kind of sore that makes you feel you're accomplishing something.  I want to mention is that I'm not a young'un....I'm 55 years old, and not a tri-athelete by any means.  I'm so delighted that I discovered Tracy, because with hard work, I am getting my body back and I couldn't be happier.",1298246400,17,1322,4.445833333333334

3561939,4,B001F2APHU,"This is definitely a challenging workout.  Im a mom of a 2 year old and have always been thin without needing to workout, until of course I had my daughter:)  Since then I lost the baby weight quickly but my stomach is pouchy and I have some lovehandles, and my thighs have grown bigger. It used to be that I just didn't eat as much and my weight would go down but those days are over!  So i got this video based on the reviews here, and found the workout really difficult.  I have to take breaks often, I'm not sure how often other people are breaking during the workout but I cannot go straight through this thing.  I agree with others that it is hard to follow without constantly looking at the video because she doesn't give cues for when she is going to change positions and when she is going to end particular exercise.  Those aspects are really important for a workout video, for motivational purposes and for general instruction.  It also makes it much harder to move and strains your neck to have to constantly be checking the video while you need to focus on exercising (esp for those leg exercises where you face the floor!). I gave the video 4 stars because I really think her workout is good and will show results.  The first time I used it i felt muscles I didn't even know I had, and i was sore for a week! SHe works the transverse muscles alot, which is important to get your stomach back. I will continue her video and also use a yoga dvd (rodney yee..who is an EXCELLENT instructor and narrator).  I do agree with another reviewer about the shoulders, some of her shoulder exercises are too much for me and I just don't do them for now.",1296172800,,1654,4.326860841423948

I lost a lot of weight after the pregnancy, but I am still at least 10lb over my weight and it seems that it's all in my middle section. I worked out twicw so far, the first time I only managed to do half of the dvd( my kids woke up and had to attend to them) but now I just finished the entire workout and I already felt that it was easier to do the exercises.

I read through almost all of the reviews for both programs and decided to purchase both of them, and I alternate between the two. I will say, however, that the Post-Pregnancy workout is a better workout in all areas except the arm series. I feel more muscles being worked in this one (except for the arms) and I also think her cueing is much better versus the Mat Method (although could still use a little work!). That being said, I agree with all of the reviews that her dvd's need chapters for each segment. If that were the case I would do this entire dvd and the arms segment from the Mat Method dvd. I also really like the classical music - it's SO much better than the typical muzak sound that most workout dvd's use. This is definitely challenging - I can't get through every exercise yet and I am sore afterwards. It's 45 minutes, it goes by so quickly. I am 3 months postpartum with my second child and my body isn't bouncing back as quickly the second time around...I definitely feel this will help and I am happy I purchased it.",1294099200,4,1095,4.399014778325123

The mat workout is very good but I was expecting an all over workout and this didn't have anything cardio based at all.  The majority of the space is used up on interviews with Tracy and with G. Paltrow that I didn't care to waste my time watching when I was looking to get a good workout.  I was disappointed in the quanitity of the excercise and would not recommend it unless you want a short comprehensive mat workout.,1285027200,,571,4.451923076923077

I only wish I would have known about this before! I did not start it until my baby was 5mths old. After doing the work out for 4days, I saw results! In my arms, and in my tummy area also! My husband is in REALLY good shape, so when he saw me doing this work and joked OH that's NOT hard! I challanged him to do it, and he tried it and was dying right along w/ me!

This is NOT an easy work out! Which I am thankful for! I look forward to doing this work out over and over again! This is one I will not get board with! There isn't a cardio program with it, but it also says that it doesn't come with one. I enjoy jogging with my daughter in her stroller and my husband joins us :) This is a great workout, and it's HARD, very HARD, but well worth it! And when you start to see results in 4days like I did, you will become hooked also! I highly recommend this DVD! :)

I had flat abs before, but the lines I am seeing right now are really nice.

Second, there is not a lot of instruction.  You need to watch to understand where she goes next.  With time you can anticipate, but I found that to be annoying for the first few weeks.

3561992,5,B001F2APHU,"Not to sound corny, but Tracy Anerson's Method Post-Pregnancy Workout truly is ""magical"". I have never had abs that you could see before and I was in the Army for 8 years. So, now being in my 30's and 3 kids later to achieve this is truly amazing. I do this dvd alone 2-4 times a week and walk w/my 2 little ones in the double stroller (youngest is 11 mos) and I have seen the most drastic changes to my physique ever- such as smaller, tighter arms; leaner,  more toned legs; and, of course, a tighter mid-section and smallest waist size I've ever had. People are complimenting me asking me what I've been doing and I am pleased to tell them about this DVD. All this has happened without change to my diet even.

As far as the DVD itself, it is shot in a beautiful setting and easy enough to follow but at times Tracy doesn't cue you exactly so you do kind of have to pay close attention but after a few times, you know when it's time to switch, etc. The moves are challenging enough but not too difficult that you can't work up to completing each set. The pike series is especially challenging but DEFINITELY effective so it is sooooo worth it if you can stick with it. She's not kidding about that annoying flap of skin leftover from having a baby- it really went away. Speaking of annoying though, I have to laugh when she recommends doing this workout with your little ones around you, I tend to get a bit flustered when they're climbing all over me and I'm trying to workout:) But hey, if during nap-time is not an option then I guess that'll have to do. For me, the length is perfect and I can usually even do the cool-down before one of the littles wake up.

I can't say enough how pleased I am with this purchase. I am contemplating buying her other DVD's such as the cardio or mat workout but am reading mixed reviews on amazon for some of her other stuff.

3561996,5,B001F2APHU,"Background (fill disclosure): I am 2.5 years Post Partum (following twins) - I had been working out in spurts 2-3 months on and then off, but always pretty consistent on my pilates and core type stuff. 3 months ago I took my workouts up a notch and increased my cardio intensity and began counting calories. I spin 2x a week and I do weights and boxing.

Review: About 6 weeks ago I began using this DVD instead of my pilates video 2-3x week. The reviews promise amazing results and during the video she talks right to the weak spots - extra skin, the pooch etc.

The video: Nice setting, nice music, Tracy is pleasant to listen to, although the ques are quiet and sometimes I miss when to switch sides. She's not as cautious as I would like with form and some of these exercises could really strain your back -so I would caution a beginner to be careful.

The video is about 45 mins long, about 25 mins in abs, 10 mins in legs and 10 mins in arms. I do other stuff for my legs and arms, so I pretty much only did the abs part -although I have done the entire thing.

Abs:
This is one tough workout. I mean I was in decent shape to begin with and decent core strength, but this workout is very challenging, but in a great way.  It is divided into 3 sections -crunch type, pike (think V-up) and plank type. The variety is nice and she has a few modifications that work new and different places.
So does it work? I *think* so - I've made so many changes it is hard to say what is working, but it is definitely helping. I mean I still have a small layer of fat across my belly, but you can't spot reduce and a workout isn't really going to help that (hence counting calories). But my abs are tons tighter and I can now outlast the youngsters (including the buff ones) in my boxing class ab workout. In short I plan to keep on doing this video and recommend it to anyone that is interested because it is just a great 25 min ab/core workout. I don't know if it will do everything it promises but I'm a heck of a lot closer than I have been.

Legs and Arms:
I personally think this these are too brief to do much, but it is better than nothing. I had been using them as warmups to my weight workouts -but I had to stop on the legs because she does a lot of stuff where you balance on one leg and that stresses my IT band injury.
The arm workout is one of those that you keep your arms up for ever and it burns like heck -but those have never done much for my stubborn arms. I'm still doing it though because at least it will help my boxing.",1280793600,2,2534,4.0885311871227366

The work out is an hour long and she means for you to do it daily if you can, although how this will happen with my gurgling baby to look after I'm not quite sure.  Its a rigorous workout but after one session I could feel it and although it nearly killed me (where have my ab muscles gone to??) I really think that its a wonderful workout for those that mean business and aim to get their pre baby body back, with maximum effort.

I am Asian, 5""4, I started the video when my 2nd baby was 11 months old(although Tracy recommended to start her method as soon as possible). I had already shed pounds and was able to squeeze into my old jeans, however, I was not happy because my tummy was still flabby with the extra skin and fat. I felt like I had to wear high waist cut clothes for the rest of my life. However, this is NOT TRUE! I gave this video a try and I saw the result within one month(3 sessions per week). With no special diet, wow I have refined lean muscles on my abs and I am bikini ready! I shrank one more size and now look great in skinny jeans and tight top, no tummy or lover's handle at all.

To warn you, this video is tough, especially for beginners, I was swearing all the way for the first month and there was a lot of pain to endure. Just try to protect you back and try to follow all the moves. You will get through it eventually.

I'm tall-ish at 5'9 and have forever fluctuated in weight: size 8 through 12--I'm at my size 12's again and not happy about it--neither are my hips... I'm eating healthy, but I'm also eating out and NOT being good--(I have a Mexican food addiction).  I figured I'd start working out with this and rotate with some of my other dvds.  I haven't even been doing cardio/treadmill but a couple times a week--which is normal for me.  (If I don't exercise, I have issues.)  Here's the part that made me stare in the mirror an unusually long time... My waist is already melting away... seriously...  I'm flabbergasted.  I had been telling myself I'll start with the exercising and then work into trying harder.  I cannot even complete the exercises when I do them and I wondered if it was doing me ANY good as I quit half way and mumble to Tracy that she's torturing me... It will be awhile until I will be able to complete the dvd, but it's now officially a goal of mine.  I've only used it 3 times with about 3-4 days in between each workout.  The crazy thing is I haven't done anything else and I'm already seeing results.  I like the dvd and it's the one I want to do now over all the others.  All I can say, is I'm definitely motivated to bump up the number of times I use it.  I think I'll get a little more serious about the diet portion too--I'm completely amazed and give this workout the credit for beginning to melt that 40 something belly-extra weight used to spread evenly all over, but not now...I cannot wait to see it disappear completely and have that skin tighten up.  I highly recommend this dvd for results around the middle.  My arms already tightened up a bit as well--which I like my arms, so that wasn't even a concern, but I could use a tune up all over, so I'm extremely happy with this purchase.",1274918400,4,2044,4.306282722513089

3562028,5,B001F2APHU,"This workout is simple and straight to the point. This is exactly what I need to help get rid of my tummy flab. I used to do kickboxing before I got pregnant and this dvd feels like it will give me stronger abs before I start doing kickboxing in a couple of months. I love all of the ab exercises she does....some simple...some are hard! But you have to take it at your own pace. I think there is just the right amount of ab exercises, leg exercises and arm exercises. Warm-up and cool down could be a little better but I already know a few extra things I can do on my own. I have been doing this for a week now and I'm soooooo sore. But I love it because I know it's actually working!! There is no crazy loud music in the background which is nice and Tracy doesn't talk to much..... just enough to keep you focused on the moves. The set-up of where she is doing the routines is nice and relaxing...I like it! I plan on purchasing more of her workout dvds in the future. I would highly recommend this to any of my girlfriends...baby or no baby!",1271289600,4,1044,4.122549019607843
3562029,5,B001F2APHU,"Another great workout from Tracy.  I haven't had a baby in 10 years, but I've got the typical trouble spots of any 40-something woman, and I thought this DVD might help. It did!  As in the Mat workout, I find that Tracy acts a bit pouty, but I find her very likable.  There's more direction in this one vs. Mat, but not so much that it's annoying.  The music in this one is pleasant, it reminds me of the background music in a Disney film or something.  I find this to be heavier on abs than Mat, which I expected.  That's ok with me, but in this workout, some of the ab exercises are done without neck support (as opposed to in her Mat workout, where the neck was supported in each exercise).  This is a biggy with me, as I've got a sensitive neck that if treated wrong, will be out of whack for days.  I am able to modify things a bit in order to fully support my neck, though, so I'm still able to do all the moves.  Maybe not as effectively as Tracy, but effectively enough, as I certainly felt this the next day!  This is lighter in the arms than Mat, but still a good series of exercises that will produce results, in my opinion.  I love the leg/butt exercises in this DVD, maybe even more than in Mat, because I really felt the burn in this one.  And I'm getting results after alternating this with her Mat workout for 4 weeks, 4-6 times a week.  I'm getting definition in spots that I don't ever recall having definition, and my clothes are getting looser.  Yippee!  Great workout--give it a try.  I'm off to buy her Perfect Design Series, as I can't seem to get enough :).",1271116800,,1581,4.20265780730897
3562045,5,B001F2APHU,I highly recommend any of Tracy Anderson's Workout DVD's...she really knows her stuff and you can really start to feel it when your working out.  She works areas of a womens body that most would not.  If you are trying to get rid of your baby fat..this DVD is the one for you!  Try it...you will like it : ),1270512000,,307,4.083333333333333

3562047,5,B001F2APHU,"I bought this video after receiving my Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow weekly update where she praised Tracey Andersons ability to transform her body post baby. I had just had my second child and had just finished nursing so I was ready to shed some pounds. I had been working out in a gym 3-4x a week and didn't really notice a difference. I started this video and the transformation was amazing! I wasn't very heavy to begin with I am 5'7 and was 145 after the baby and when I started working out, I am now around 123-125! I definitely changed what I ate but this has toned everything that was still hanging. I can't believe how good I look. I look better than I did prebabies! Thank you Tracey, you're the best!!!!",1266969600,12,709,4.338345864661654
3562048,5,B001F2APHU,"Definitely purchase the video,but DO NOT use it as your first post natal work out!!!!!  It is a great work out and will definitely get you back into shape, but you need to recondition your traumatized body more gently at first.  Being the athletic sort, I was too pig-headed to admit to myself that I needed a ""wimp"" work out to recover.  I started with Tracy anderson and ended up hurting myself in the long run.  By not reconditioning properly from the start, I made my diastasis recti worse and lost all control of my abdominal strength as a result. I recommend starting with Helene Byrne's Bounce Back Fast Post natal Core Conditioning dvd and/or book (on amazon or [...]), then most definitley moving on to Tracy Anderson.  With in a few weeks Bounce Back Fast will help you to regain control of your muscles, mend diastasis recti (if you are cursed with it), and strengthen everything that pregnancy weakened without you realizing it.  After you are done with Helen, Tracy will help you get your hot-mom body.",1266624000,27,1015,4.674157303370786
3562049,5,B001F2APHU,I have done the Tracy Anderson Mat Excercise DVD and love it.  I had read other reviews that this Post Pregnancy DVD is great for working your abs so I ordered it ~ even though I am 54. It is a challenging but gentle approach workout giving attention to your abs and legs and bottom. It is perfect for a new mother and how to get her body into shape after having her baby.  The setting is inviting and classical music is playing -giving you a calm setting to workout in. Everything from the room and the candles and pillows in the background to even what Tracy has on - gives you an invite you can't resist - even with your baby in front of you asleep. I recommend this workout highly to anyone ~ she is a really sweet girl and really understands how to get a great looking womens body. Mine has changed and I am looking great!,1265328000,4,827,4.1625

3562051,5,B001F2APHU,"I really like this toning workout routine (there is no cardio in this).  She is so encouraging throughout it and gives ways to dumb things down if you are early in getting back in shape, and then shows way to make it harder once you are advanced.  I was a bit apprehensive when I saw her cover being a bit ""Brittany Spears looking"", but the video itself is so not like that- classical music, she's wearing a normal workout outfit, and she is quite frankly pretty humble about how she got her body back after her pregnancy and gaining 60lbs during it.  2 thumbs up!!  And have already recommended it to friends of mine.  Don't forget to buy some 2lb or 3lb dumbells to go along with the routine.",1259971200,6,694,4.348837209302325

Even though I've never been pregnant, my flabby abs and back have always been my trouble areas. After I turned 40 my mid-section looked even worse. Tracy really knows how to slim down and tone this troublesome area and I'd be surprised if it didn't make a noticeable improvement for ANY woman's abs.

I never thought after having three kids, especially two back to back that I would ever feel comfortable showing my stomach again, but I do after using this video. I worked very hard to loose the weight, but had a hard time toning up my entire mid section. I would not recommend this DVD as a weight loss workout, but I would most certainly recommend this for toning up problem areas once you have reached your weight goals. Honestly, you could combine this with a cardio DVD and alternate days with them, and that might be effective too. I don't get excited about videos very often, but this one has worked for me and my friend that introduced me to it. I am a big fan of the gym and don't have much of an attention span with a video (as I have three kids under 6 at the house), but I find it easy to do this every other day.

- She really knows what she is doing, i'm feeling abs that I never felt before.
- This workout is good for non-mummies as well. Abs, Butt, Thighs, Arms.
- Really like the classical music, nice shift from the annoying dance music
- Nice setting, Gwyneth's got a lovely little exercise area
- She's encouraging and just when you think that you can't take anymore, she is moving on to the next move - so you are motivated to carry on.

Cons
- She is not very clear on when she is going to change moves
- Very little instruction is given on the moves themselves (but then again, they are pretty simple)
- She needs to be a little louder
- Not advisable for anyone with lower back or neck problems, you'll really destroy yourself with this workout if you do have such conditions.
- A lot of time is spent on the ab work, she sorta rushes through all the other parts.

On the whole, i would recommend this to anyone who is looking to wake up their abs!",1253836800,5,951,4.21978021978022

3562129,5,B001F2APHU,"I gave birth to my second child 6 months ago, and the squishy tummy wasn't going away as quickly as the first time. So I've been doing the TA post preg dvd for only about 1 month now, 5 days a week.  I've still got lots of work ahead before I look ""pre-pregnancy"" but I'm already seeing results, even my husband noticed that my tummy is much flatter!  Some women like a more muscular physique, I prefer a small, toned figure and this is what this dvd will do for you.  Tracy's routine is totally different than anything I've ever done before, and it leaves you sore in the weirdest way. There isn't any cardio, like others have stated, which means you get 45 minutes of just muscle work.  Its a great accompaniment to a cardio program you may already be doing, or you can try her Dance Cardio dvd.  I like the calm classical music in the background, with 2 kids in the house, the calmer, the better!  Tracy's cues aren't always on point, but after doing the dvd 2-3 times you'll have learned the moves and  can easily follow her without having to constantly watch the screen.  The bulk of the dvd is ab work with a bit of arm and leg/butt, using your body as resistance. You will need 3lb weights for part of the work.  Bottom line, if you do this dvd consistently and eat healthy you'll start seeing results in a very short amount of time.",1252454400,10,1340,4.306772908366534
3562130,4,B001F2APHU,"I gave this 4 stars because I enjoy the workout itself.  But I am extremely disappointed with Tracy.  You can barely hear her speak, if she speaks at all.  And her hair is complete distraction for her... she is constantly getting it out of her eyes and off her shoulders.  You never know how many reps she is going to do because she doesn't say and she doesn't do a countdown.  She doesn't give you helpful hints like, ""breathe in, breathe out,"" or ""focus on xyz bodypart.""  Or if she does, she gives it toward the end of the repitition when you're almost done.  Also, there is no beat with the music (classical) so it's hard to follow her rhythm, you basically have to watch her the entire time.  She starts out ok in the beginning but by the cool down she has stopped speaking completely and you just have to follow her lead.  Didn't she get feedback from others before releasing the DVD?  She could've put forth a little more effort and made it awesome instead of mediocre.  All that aside, I do like her exercises and they're very different from what I'm used to.  I felt sore in all the right places.  I'm going to stick with it but I hope her other DVD's aren't this poorly put together.",1250294400,,1193,4.343891402714932

Not everyone can be like Angelina Jolie and pop back (after twins no less) to a tiny size.  I think just accepting that fact for ourselves is liberating enough. I currently weigh a bit over 200 pounds.  I found this video challenging, but I feel motivated by it so I try to do a few more reps each time.  Being healthy for me and my baby is a priority for me.  Tracy says in the video to just have your baby next to you and Gywenth Paltrow says in her interview on the disc that there have been many times when her kids were crawling all over the ground around her while she did the workout.  Tracy is very supportive and urges you throughout the video to not worry if you can't do all the moves yet; she says how it's completely normal and natural after having your baby to not even feel like your muscles are working.  I have to honestly say that her confident and calm demeanor make me walk away feeling good about myself and the time I spent doing her video.

It took me about 4 tries just to get through the ab routine. I say the logistics suck because the music is slow classical music, and there is no rhythm at all. She does not give a lot of verbal cues, so you have to really watch the TV which can be hard as you're working out.

3562145,4,B001F2APHU,"*I have never given birth. I bought this DVD to recover from an abdominal surgery that was similar to a C-section. I thought this workout would help me wake up and rehabilitate my abs and it has.

Tracy does say that she gained 60 pounds during her pregnancy, and is also convinced that her method helps magically flatten that flap of skin that hangs in the belly after giving birth.

She begins with a warmup, goes into a great abdominal workout, transitions into the hips and thighs, gives you 5 [signature Tracy Anderson] hip/thigh exercises, then goes into the arm workout, and ends with a ballet influenced cool down.

I find that I look forward to doing the workout, my body craves the exercises, and it feels satisfying to do them. I work up a sweat and my heart-rate increases.

In my opinion, the abs workout is the strongest part of the DVD and the arm workout is the least developed. She doesn't take you through many repetitions of the arm exercises, and as a result, that section seems rushed and ends abruptly. She also doesn't share any information about the number of reps you should be working towards or give any tips to help you get the best results from her workout. All she says is to work your abs everyday and try to do this workout 4-6 times a week. I also would have liked her to share more detailed instructions for proper alignment while performing all of the exercises.

I've been doing this routine 4-5 times a week for 3 weeks and am encouraged by the results. So far the noticeable results are: improvements in strength and stamina, an increase in muscle definition in my thighs, a lift in the butt, and new muscle tone in abs. My most encouraging results are that the flesh of my hips, thighs, butts and abs doesn't seem to hang off my body the way that it used to. It has more tone. These noticeable changes in my body keep me inspired to find time to do the workout. I also like  that I'm not sore the next day, which can be a serious deterrent for me to establish consistency with my workouts.

Other great things are that you only need a couple of light weights and that the workout can be memorized. I have worked out while on vacation and own my own - without the DVD. This is exactly what I wanted - a workout that I like, enjoy doing, get results from and can practice on my own almost anywhere.",1247443200,40,2335,4.391203703703703

Also, I have to rave about the client service from Tracy Anderson's team.

Yet, even after shedding the weight, I was still unable to fit properly into my jeans due to my body shifting to accommodate my growing belly.
Tracy understands this as she herself has had a child and thus has designed this workout to really get your body back to what it was like pre-pregnancy.

My other issue is that I found some of the moves too advanced, especially of you haven't workout out due to the pregnancy. Not only do these moves hurt your back, but it can be discouraging.

Tracy even says at the beginning that she starts out simple to ""wake up"" your abs so you can do the more challenging exercises later.  To me, this means don't be upset if you can't do the more challenging moves right away.

As Tracy also says, as you get better at these moves you will get more in touch with your abs and feel them even more.  This is true!!  I agree that Tracy doesn't give many audible clues that she has switched moves, but it only takes a few times watching to learn her routine and then you don't really need to watch, because you know anyway.

The best part is that even though I don't have time to watch every day, I can pick which exercises I want to do (the most challenging moves for me) before bed and get a mini workout in now that she's taught me.",1246492800,,914,4.2485549132947975

I had my second child about 13 weeks prior to starting this workout - and yes, as the other reviews state, it is HARD.  I could not complete all the moves - and had to sit out to rest through a good part of it when i started... but, working with it about 3 - 4 times a week (She suggests 4-6, but i just wasn't able to make that time for just this workout) I was able to complete the entire workout in less than a month.  I love that it focuses on the core, but works the arms and legs as well.  I noticed a difference in only a few workouts!  DISCLAIMER - I'd been doing pretty much nothing since I'd gotten pregnant w/ my daughter - but i did find that i bounced back pretty quickly w/ the help of this workout.
Some drawbacks - I agree w/ some of the others, that chapters would be nice so i could do a more condensed workout.  Also, she does not do much instruction throughout an exercise.  I found that was really not a problem - the moves were all simple (not easy mind you, but simple).  All in all - a really great workout DVD to add to your collection.

There are only two camera angles, and they are not used effectively to show you proper positioning. You cannot rely on Ms. Anderson to tell you too much about positioning as she gives very little verbal instruction.  The music has little to do with the workout, so don't rely on that to inspire you.  Ms. Anderson appears, at least by my count, to lose count or not keep it.  She holds some stretches and moves for a long time and then shorter on the opposite side, too.  I think a director would have helped to her offer her chatter while doing some of the moves rather than have we the audience listen to it over and over while waiting to go on to the next move.  We heard about her son, Sam, the first time through the video, so it gets old.  Again, the workout itself is good, but during the 45 minutes and especially with repeat viewings the flaws really stand out in this video. I think I even can hear one of the camera people sneeze, which wasn't edited out.",1246147200,,1161,4.347222222222222

3562166,5,B001F2APHU,"I purchased this DVD to tone my body after baby #2.  I started 6 weeks post-partum and was barely able to do much of the abdominal work.  But now, after doing the DVD 4-5 times/week, I've gained so much strength in my abs that I can almost complete the DVD (@ 11 weeks post-partum).  I still don't have her 6 pack abs, but that will take more time & weight loss (and different genes!).  The abdominal section is the hardest & really gives a great toning workout.  I did for sure lose inches in my tummy, hips & butt.  After doing the DVD for 5 weeks, I've pretty much got the abs & butt section memorized, which is nice.  Because now, I can sneak in the exercises between chasing 2 kids (or even when the oldest is watching Barney).  But, I still watch the video for the arms.  The video itself is pretty relaxing w/ the classical music.  I would recommend it for post-pregnancy toning, but you'll need something else to get in that cardio.",1245974400,,940,4.32
3562167,5,B001F2APHU,"I really liked this workout DVD because it really focuses on the abs which I desperately need. I am not post pregnant and it is very difficult, so I can't imagine using it right after a c-section. I use it in conjunction with the her mat video for a really intense workout about 6 days a week. I own all 3 of her DVDs but was very disappointed with her cardio so I just skip it - I just do my own. One thing I don't like is that there are no chapters and it can be a real time-waster having to fast forward or rewind. She doesn't cue so you have to watch her carefully the first few times but I can overlook it because I feel really invigorated after doing these. I saw some definition in my abs the first few times I used it. I feel like the money was well spent on this video but I refuse to follow her insane diet.",1245110400,,817,3.927710843373494
3562168,4,B001F2APHU,"I love her moves and her exercises are definitely great, but after pregnancy I needed to really be a bit in shape before I could even begin to complete half of this workout. It is challenging. I wish it had the following:  1) better music (classical doesn't do it for me)  2) Chapters that said- Abs, Legs, Arms so that you could just pick a certain part of your body to work on if you aren't up for doing all of the work out and 3) more cardio.

I also did not know how many reps we were going to do (like please say- 8 more!)  I just need more of a push when I work out.  When your leg lifts start to hurt, you want to know, I only have 5 more to go.

I did not feel it was worth such a high price.  There are other great workouts for less than this.  I will continue to use it though along with my daily jog and weight lifting.",1245024000,,830,3.8411764705882354
3562169,5,B001F2APHU,"This is the second Tracy Anderson video I own.  I also own the Mat Warkout.  I am a former ACE certified trainer who is now at home with two small boys.  My youngest does not like daycare centers, so gyms have not really worked out for me.  I also have a really hard time doing fitness videos, they bore me.  Tracy Anderson has managed to break that habit for me.  Her videos are fantastic.  I found the Mat Workout first, I was looking for something that was mostly a body weight workout and not a ""dance or aerobic"" video, because I run.  I wanted a strength workout.  Both videos I own are fantastic.  Very yoga, pilates, dance inspired, but definitely some moves all her own, and definitely a ""method"" I have never seen as a trainer.  A lot of fitness professionals doubt her use of only 3 lb weights in the arm workouts, but I can tell you, you won't need any more, and I started with two pounds.  I also like the stretching and lengthening that your body experiences during the workout.  My hips are more open when I run, which has been something I have been trying to achieve for quite some time with yoga and stretching.  I also have a little lift in my butt now, which I have never had before.
Now, be cautioned, this post pregnancy video is not an ""ease you back into exercise"" video, it is a ""kick your butt because your out of shape"" video.  It is much harder than the Mat Workout.  If you are out of shape, I would start with the Mat Workout.  I alternate them every other day, because it is very necessary to alternate your workouts once you have been doing the same thing for a while.  I do the videos 6 days a week, which she will instruct you to do them I think 5 or 6 times a week.  It is an hour a day to put in.  I also try to squeeze in some running or walking, she suggests her dance cardio video.  I do not have that one because I usually do not enjoy those type videos and I read that it was hard to follow, but I have a friend who has it, and hope to view it soon.  All in all a great workout video, I enjoy it enough to do it 6 times a week, and I always say, the right workout is the one that you enjoy and will do faithfully, so check it out, you will definitely see results if you do it regularly.  Oh, I started these workouts approximately two months ago.  Lost about 7 more pounds and lots of great definition in ab area, hips/hip flexors and amazing lift in butt never seen before.  Overall better endurance during running and hips more open, steps more ""springy"" during run.  I hope you enjoy them as much as me:)",1245024000,44,2547,4.136456211812627
3562170,5,B001F2APHU,"I have to say, this is the best workout ever!  I had a c-section last year and although I lost all the weight rather quickly, I was plagued by loose hanging tummy skin.  I never ever ever thought that it was possible to pull skin back to muscle, and thought that this was the best it would be.  Then I found Tracy Anderson and learned the error of my ways ;)  I've been doing this video for exactly 6 weeks now and my body has never looked so good!  I can't beleive it, almost all of that hanging skin has smoothed back out (just a small bit left around my belly button)and my muscles are more defined than ever, not to mention my newly aquired rump :)  There's no doubt that you have to be consistent with it, but when you see results within the first 7 to 10 workout sessions, who wouldn't want to be consistant?  Let's face it, you're not going to get an awesome body by doing 10 minute workouts twice a week.  A lot of people have complained that she doesn't give much instruction, I personally like that aspect, and seriously, if you actually do the video, it really only takes a couple of times to get the timing right. All in all this is a great routine and I am so glad to have found it, really I never thought my stomach could ever look this good again.",1244678400,71,1262,4.1646090534979425

3562185,4,B001F2APHU,"I borrowed this DVD from a friend and have been doing it for about a month.  I gave it 4 stars since I like the exercises, but it should have 1 star for her instruction.
Pros: Targets some key areas for post-natal women: hips, butt, abs, and arms.  Some of the leg exercises are cool due to the different angles she uses.  The arm section is great since she does a lot without weights and you really feel the burn.  Very innovative.

Cons: not balanced for the body.  She does nothing to strengthen your back to balance out all the abdominal work, or nothing to stretch out your abs.  You should NEVER do all those abdominal crunches without balancing it with some back extensions.  She should know better!  And the stretching is a joke.  She never talks about engaging your pelvic floor muscles, which is so important for moms who have just given birth.

I do this video for the target areas listed above, but I also do Pilates to give my body more of a balanced workout.  And I do less reps in the ab section.  I focus on good alignment and proper execution of the exercise.  She teaches none of that.  So, in conclusion, I think it is a good workout to get those areas toned, but beware of alignment or else you could get injured.  Take it slow and don't do all the reps at first or else you may hurt your neck or back.",1244246400,12,1322,4.270161290322581

I have not had a baby yet but hope that these exercises will help my recovery when I do!!! I will explain the video in detail below for those that are interested. Please note, I have not started using the 3 lbs weights recommended yet.

*Abs are the the focus for about 1/3 of the 45 min video, the exercises are intense and I really feel like I am targeting my entire core

*Leg & Glut work follow and if you don't cheat, you will really feel the burn!

*The final 1/3 of the video focuses in on your arms and again, even without weights my arms are burning!!

3562188,5,B001F2APHU,"I was very skeptical about this video, however after one workout, my abs were incredibly sore and the movements are gently and easy so you don't know that you are getting the intense workout at the time.

3562189,5,B001F2APHU,"Hi. I love this video! New and great moves I've never seen before. I have danced all my life too and been doing aerobics on and off for 15 years. I am a mom of one 8 month old baby and I'm 28. This workout has been an inspiration to me. It was super hard at first but could complete all the 45 mins. I have been doing this video for a month now and I have seen results. I do it with ankle weights by now, Im stronger than ever eventhough still have some baby weight to loose.

The improvements I would suggest for this video are:
-To be more clear on the instructions when changing legs, or do another kind of move. Some of my pilates and jane fonda videos I can do without watching the TV set. For this you have to be attentive of the TV set to keep up the pace and this distracts you from concentrating on breathing while doing the effort.
-I am no expert, but I think that the warm up and the cool down sessions are not to good. I don't feel any warmer before begining the excercise, so I try to do some kind of aerobics for half an hour before this video. And the cool down I do streches on my own.
Over all, I totaly recomend this video. Its great to do something else besides the good old aerobics or treadmil. As soon as I can, I will buy the mat workout dvd.",1243987200,3,1266,3.9647058823529413

-The workout is extremely difficult-  which is GOOD.  I wouldn't want a workout video that I could do perfectly the first time around.

-I actually like that she doesn't talk TOO much.  Yes-  the first couple times,  you'll have to watch more than DO, so you can see what she's doing.  But,  i hate when people talk too much (Denise Austin!)  and then you have to listen to the SAME dumb comments every time you work out.

-Her movements are very graceful,  like ballet.

*now for the BAD PART-  she has you doing a lot of exercises that are very strenuous to the shoulders.

I HAVE TO SEE AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON due to the injury I incurred while doing the DVD!  My rotator cuff is injured.  I am a 28 year old, in shape woman, and I have done plenty of workout vidoes- but still managed to injure myself while following the routine.

It's very easy to follow along, and she explains why she does what she's doing. She recomends to do it everyday, but I find it helps if you start off slow, so I do it every other day. It's about 45 min total, so it's fairly quick. She does some weight workouts, 5lbs, so make sure to have little hand weights. Other than that, awesome!!! Thumbs way up. :)",1243468800,,684,4.0
3562192,3,B001F2APHU,"The exercises themselves left me comfortably sore the next day.  Only a few gripes about the video. Anderson doesn't talk through the exercises and assumes that you are staring at the tv the whole time.  No counts, so you're not sure how many reps you should be doing or when to switch.  This can be overcome once you do the workout a couple of times and know what is coming up.

No chaptering, so you can't just do abs, arms or butt part.  Would recommend this dvd when the lil one is asleep and you know will be asleep for an hour or your lil one is more well behaved on their own.

Also no cardio workout, so you're going to need to add cardio in order to blast the fat or you'll probably end up with great ab muscles but still not know it from the layer of fat on top.

The sound is bad, the music is worse (it would be fine for a library but not for a workout), and she doesn't even attempt to explain what she is doing (i.e. the number of reps, or where you should feel an exercise, etc.).  You have to watch the screen a lot in order to know when to switch sides or move on to the next exercise.  I have definitely seen an improvement in my abs over the past month, but I would say it is weak on the other areas (arms, legs, back and butt).  I memorized the video now (I took the time to count the amount of reps she does of each exercise) so I can just do it on my own with my own music and usually with my baby next to me.",1242777600,2,723,3.8322147651006713

Again, there's no chaptering!  Considering that this workout is clearly segmented, it's astonishing that no one could be bothered to chapter it.

That said, I've been doing this DVD and the The Mat DVD for the past 3 months, 4-6 times a week as Tracy recommends. The results are truly amazing, but it comes with a lot of hard work. The first week or so I was so sore- I never have been that sore in my whole life and I've been working out forever. It's the most motivating DVD I've done because Tracy's figure is ideal to me- fit yet very feminine. Plus, Gwyneth is GORGEOUS. In the Post Pregnancy DVD she uses classical music and focuses on the abs more, which I love. I hate the techno stuff in most workout DVDs. A lot of reviewers complain that she doesn't instruct enough- that's a plus for me. It doesn't get irritating and after a couple of times you get the hang of it anyway. I can't stand all of the motivational blather most workout girls do. She's very quiet- I love that. Her arm series are probably her strongest area. They are exhausting and most workout DVDs don't emphasize arms enough. Her warm ups/cool downs are her weakest areas- seems like she's just doing any old thing, but who cares? It's the workout that counts and she is amazing. I've trimmed down SO much and notice such a difference in my post-pregnancy belly (I've had an 11 pound baby and then twins- so my poor tummy has been through hell.) The Mat DVD is still a great workout but I don't tend to go to it as much just because the music is ultra cheesy and Tracy pouts and tries to act super sexy in it which can drive me crazy. I'm going to try the Cardio Dance DVD next- I've heard that ones hard to follow but I trust Tracy and will do whatever she tells me! She knows what she's doing!",1238976000,22,1755,4.24179104477612

I watched the DVD first before trying it and thought that it was easy - maybe too easy.  Well, I was wrong.  This kicked my butt - literally!!!  I still can't get through it entirely.  As crazy as my day is, I still make an effort to find the time. I have not yet gotten through it while my baby naps, but I just put him in the activity center when he wakes and finish as much as I can.  It is doable!

Like many folks, I always read both the positive and negative comments - so here is my best at defending all the negative stuff:

Slow shipping - yes - it took about 2 weeks to receive the DVD. I was anxious, which made it worse, but it was well worth the wait.

Classical background music - yes - it is very different from the normal upbeat/techno routines, BUT it is very relaxing and calming.  It also helps keep my infant calm as he watches mommy exercise.  It is a pleasant change that helps me relax, take time for myself and focus on the routine.

No instruction - yes - Tracy does not announce every transition nor does she indicate how many reps for each exercise.  Just watch the DVD one time all the way through and you'll be fine.  You'll quickly memorize the routine.",1238544000,4,1331,4.128404669260701
3562230,5,B001F2APHU,"I bought this DVD because I've been losing weight and I want to prevent any lose or sagging areas.  I really love it, but it's very challenging.  She really seems to expect a lot from you.  I was sore all over for the first few days (I also used the Mat workout), but I felt great.  I could really feel the changes in my body after the first week.
This workout doesn't include any cardio, so I'd recommend doing 15-20 minutes (or more) of that before using this DVD.  Being warmed up helps.  She doesn't offer many modified versions of the movements, so you kind of have to try your best and do what you can.  I can't really do the plank exercises yet, but I try to do a little bit more each time.
I love the classical music in the background, and Ms. Anderson is positive and encouraging without being too perky or annoying.
All and all, I think this is a great DVD for anyone who is trying to tighten up their abs and get a smoother, sleeker look.  I always feel great after completing this workout.  I'd recommend pairing this with the Mat workout, as this one is heavy on the abs but doesn't focus too much on the arms or legs.  The Mat DVD covers those more thoroughly.",1238371200,2,1174,4.2242152466367715

It is very challenging, especially with all those muscles that ""fall asleep"" while you are pregnant, but it is a great workout!  She does give alternate moves, most of the time, if you just can't do the move.  The music is very soothing, and I love how it doesn't feel like a typical workout video.  I can already see results, and I know that my muscles are waking back up.  I am in the same boat as she was... gained 60 pounds, but I have lost 35!",1238371200,2,740,4.027397260273973

3562322,3,B001F2APHU,"It's a great workout, beautifully produced like the other Tracy Anderson Method workouts, shot in Gwyneth Paltrow's workout studio in the Hamptons. The classical music is a nice change from the usual workout muzac, and the exercises are tough, especially on the abs. Definitely don't try this for your first workout after getting doctor's clearance unless you had ripped abs before pregnancy -- you'll be sore for awhile. The arm and butt work is a little on the light side, a nice balance to Tracy's Mat Workout.

Unlike other reviews that complain there is no cardio, has anyone ever just done a muscle shaping workout?  The whole point is to add your own cardio, whether you're doing Tracy's Dance Cardio workouts, walking on a treadmill, or walking around the neighborhood with your baby (for those who are post pregnancy).  Taking off a star or two because this is not a one stop shop like Denise Austin misses the point of the entire enterprise.

But I will take off some stars for getting a DVD-R and not a pressed DVD.  I'd give this workout 5 stars, but apparently after selling out of the Post Pregnancy Workout, the seller has decided to rush DVD-R copies to market. It was extremely disheartening to open my package and find a purple backed DVD-R that had wavy lines across the top of my TV screen, even though it played fine on my PC.

Within three days I could feel muscle fibers on the sides and shortly thereafter my stomach wasn't pushing open my blouses! I've been doing it for six weeks and still fast forward through some of the exercises because I'm not able to do them...yet.

There should be more mention of the fact that this ab workout is insanely difficult and you should do what you can, build your strength and than move on. At first glance it seems impossible and could be very discouraging for many people.

Also the workout portion should be divided into chapters.

Make sure you are in decent shape before even watching this.",1236297600,4,550,4.65979381443299
3562392,5,B001F2APHU,"This dvd is the best workout for your stomach.  It exercises your entire body with added emphasis on the stomach area.  This will make you sweat and by the time you get to the butt section, you will be sweating profusely.  Many workout videos move on to another exercise just when I feel like I am able to execute the move more accurately.  Not this one, you do each movement for long enough to feel your muscle contracting the way it is supposed to contract.  I do not have any babies, but I do gain weight in my stomach more than other areas so this workout is just perfect for me.  Tracy does encourage you to keep going when perhaps you should not.  I injured my shoulder during her arm workout in the mat dvd.  I could not exercise for a little over a week, so it did not do me any good to force my arms past their limit.  I think the encouragement to keep pushing yourself is good,however we should listen carefully to our bodies at the same time.  This workout does not include cardio, which Tracy says you must combine with this floor work video to obtain maximum results.

3562393,5,B001F2APHU,I highly recommend this video. Post pregnancy or not everyone should do this workout regularly! Also I love how Tracy just dives in and starts the routine without alot of talking and explaining. This allows you to get to it without wasting precious time. The workout takes about 50 minutes total including warm up and cool down. And since Tracy is Madonna's personal trainer and traveled with Madonna while she was on tour this past year you know she's got to be good!,1236211200,,468,4.650602409638554
3562394,3,B001F2APHU,"I found this DVD to be effective however, it takes some background or experience before attempting. If you had no workout plan before pregnancy then the ab exercises are pretty tough. I had a good delivery so I can only imagine how difficult this would be for anyone who has ab separation, or did not have strong abs to begin with.
The work out is also very ballet and Pilates based, so the intensity is low but very effective. However, it's not like most workout videos. She doesn't count out the reps and doesn't offer an easy mode for all the exercises, only for some. The music is not really in sync with the exercises and is mostly just there for background.
I would not recommend this DVD if you have never done a sit up before or are just starting out. The difficulty level and length of dvd requires a lot from a new mom in my opinion. I basically squeeze it in while baby is sleeping since mine won't sit long enough to watch me do sit ups. :)
I also didn't find the stretching to compliment the exercises done. There's a lot of ab work but little ab stretching in the end.
I also didn't feel her advice on doing the DVD 5 days a week is realistic. Most moms I know are working moms and barely have time for the 48 minutes the workout entails for a few days a week.
However, so far it has been effective and although I haven't been doing it 5 days a week, my 3 days a week and proper diet has had results as well.",1236038400,4,1422,4.155797101449275

I gave the DVD only 4 stars because I thought the cardio came with it - and it should for a $30 DVD!  But the workout itself is fantastic - it fact, the first time I did it, time flew by so fast that I kept waiting to see if more exercises were coming.  I was already a regular at my gym, so my body was not out of shape completely and I could almost do the entire DVD the very first time.  And it is HARD - make no mistake.  The beginning abs section is tough and I was struggling to complete it.  But even all my gym time hasn't fixed my big trouble spots - tummy and butt  - after 2 babies.  I am confident if you do this 4-5 times a week, plus cardio whenever you can, you will see big changes.  I loved it and highly recommend it and I never like at-home exercise DVDs, so this is worth your time and effort.
But I do agree with a lot of other reviews that she needs to speak up when the exercise changes - it is difficult the first few times when you don't know what's coming and you have to keep looking at the screen.  But after a few times you get the hang of it and know what to do - but she needs to keep this in mind on any future DVDs she may do.",1235174400,,1210,3.7698412698412698

I received the video in the mail earlier than expected after ordering it, compared to some other reviews who said they experienced trouble with shipping.
Yesterday was my first time to try it, and I think it's great. I woke up with very sore muscles, some I didn't even know I had!
Some reviews said that you can barely hear her and that she fails to warn you of a side change. This actually does not happen very often, she explain pretty well what she's doing throughout the video. Besides, if you do it as often as you're supposed to (4-6 times a week) you will memorize the moves.
I absolutely love the arm and buttocks exercises. My arms have always been a trouble area for me, and every other worout seemed like it wasn't doing anything....but these arm exercises target so many muscles and I can actually feel it. Unlike workouts that drain you and strain your body, these are fun to do....but you can REALLY feel the burn.

The only thing I could complain about it the difficulty of some of the exercises. I was in pretty good shape before I had my baby, and this video is still very challenging for me...but remember, that's what actually makes the difference in your body!

This workout DVD has major flaws: 1) She does NOT provide adequate verbal instruction so this means you have to *watch* the video at all times to see when she has changed or modified the move. In the middle of the arm workout, she switches arms or modifies the move but *says* NOTHING about what she is doing. 2) She gives almost no instruction on proper technique so you are left guessing if you are doing the moves correctly. 3) There are no chapters so you can't easily jump ahead or repeat a particular section if you want to see it again.

I'm training for a marathon, and decided to buy this DVD to give my knees a break and try something different on my rest days (3).

After 1 month here's my 2 cents:

Pluses:

* Excellent core work out.
My abs have always been weak, but Tracy's method makes me feel stronger and more ""pulled together"" in my midsection.
* Butt exercises - I never thought anything could ""lift"" my butt. Running is good for that, but I have definitely seen a more in-shape form to my behind.
* Never boring - I lose interest in work out DVD's quickly, but I'm still excited to put this DVD on and get to work.
* Arms - I have always been skinny with flabby arms.
Amazing for toning arms and back. 100 % worth it just for this.
* Pretty - This is a well produced, gorgeous-looking DVD. Zero cheesiness.

Minuses:

* Tracy is soft-spoken. It's hard to tell when she's about to switch to another move. After a while you learn to anticipate what's next.

* I wish the arm routine was longer.
I have 6 work-out cards I got a few months ago from a fitness magazine where Tracy demonstrates additional arm moves not found on the DVD. I wish she had incorporated those as well. Her arm workout is super effective if done regularly. My new tank top collection is proof of that.

I was drawn to Tracy's story and solution to having gained lots of weight during her pregnancy.  I have always been hesitant to buy workout videos because they usually don't live up to my expectations, but this video is different.  Tracy's method has been proven effective (just look at her) and it is an amazing workout.  She has a unique approach as a workout instructor.  She uses a very calm voice and only speaks when giving instructions which allows the viewer to concentrate on the moves.  There is classical music in the background instead of your typical ""pump you up"" music, which from a mommy's perspective is just what i need when i've had plenty of ""pump you up"" activity with my toddler during the day.

This is a tough workout even for someone who has been doing some working out. I would think it could be a little discouraging for someone immediately post partum but also think if you did it regularly you would see major changes pretty quickly.

After having two babies 16 months apart, my body needs to get the skin back to the muscle and I am so hopeful that this will take place.

This said, I am going to stick with this video and hope to buy more of hers once I master this one. Her moves (especially the the arm workout) are very elegant and ballet-like.

She has 3 DVDs, the first two left me wondering if I ready for an intense workout yet.  Then I found the post pregnancy video, exactly what I needed! I had my doubts but tried it and was whipped!  I watched in amazement through most of it. I was so weak in my abs now and trying to support a bigger chest and tried to think of excuses to let myself not feel guilty for spending money on a DVD and not do it.  ""would it affect my milk supply if its to strenuous, it takes forever to do because I'm pausing every few mins to put my baby back to sleep, I'm too weak, ill never look like that!"" on and on were the excuses.  But I am so glad I stuck with it.  Everyday I feel my body getting stronger, my will power to not stress eat getting better, my baby learning to sleep, and me taking the time to do something good for myself.  There were so many positives that it became essential to my daily routine.
  The workout is about 45 mins long. I was worried about the length but now it fits well into the morning nap.  It's divided into chapters so you can go straight to the routine and not have to wait through commercials or other stuff.  There is soothing classical music in the background not too loud as you cant hear her, but calms you.  She is real and sincere, not loud and irritatingly perky like some workout tapes. She had a baby and was once like me, and now looks fab so it is inspiring hope that your body can be a normal shape again.  Its tough, but sticking to it has brought new strength each day. I feel good, a lil soreness that makes you feel great not debilitating that you can't function with your newborn.  The only downers about it is that she is so calm sometimes she doesn't say ""other leg or side, or always count out loud so you have to watch which makes it difficult depending on your angle, but adds to the calmness of it.  You need 1-3lb weights for some parts, and a mat helps. If you don't have weights a 16oz can equals 1lb.  She shows you modifications so you don't get discouraged because you cant do everything in the beginning.  Each day i do a lil more and it is my small triumph for the day!  I love the ballet moves, they help me feel graceful for one part of my day and the yoga breathing helps me channel stress also through the day.  I would like more stretching because it feels so good, but I love how at the end of the tape I'm not falling asleep but ready to be a mom!

3562571,4,B001F2APHU,"This video is not easy at all and really works the abs. She does provide some alternate ways to do the crunches, etc for those of us without abs of steel. She isn't very encouraging or talkative throughout the video so you must be very self motivated. That said, my abs were killing me this morning so it is working even though I couldn't finish all the video. She knows what she is doing and this will transform your body if you have the drive to get through it!

Stick with it and I am sure you will be happy. like everything in this world it doesn't come easy, you need to work. (Oh and not for anyone with a bad lower back!)",1224374400,6,628,4.105691056910569
3562572,5,B001F2APHU,"I know this DVD is aimed at post-natal women, but the way it targets common trouble areas like the abs, hips and outer-thighs makes it a wonderful workout for any woman.  I did have a baby 16 months ago, and have had a terrible time getting back in shape and losing the baby weight.  I keep buying new workout videos, looking for that magically inspirational workout that is going to help me get my body back, with no luck, until now.  I am completely hooked on Tracy Anderson!  Her DVDs are beautifully produced, the setting is elegant, the music on this DVD is classical and complements the tone of the workout very well.  Tracy's demeanor is encouraging and kind, she explains the mechanisms of each move quite well, but she does not talk too much.

The workout itself is about 45 minutes long, and is composed of a brief warm-up, a lot of ab work, some side lying ab work, some leg and glute lifts and squeezes, and then two series of arm exercises, one without weights and one with light weights, and then it finishes with a cool down and stretch.  The workout is definitely challenging, even for a more experienced student, but not overwhelmingly hard.

The greatest thing about both this post-natal workout and Tracy's Mat Workout is that they are fun - the time flies by - and they leave you feeling strong, a bit sore, but totally refreshed.  I am actually disappointed if I can't find the time to workout - definitely no ""dread-factor"" here!  Highly recommended - Thank You Tracy!",1224201600,401,1490,4.588679245283019
3562573,5,B001F2APHU,"There are a few things I really like about this DVD.
- Tracey's relaxed, encouraging tone of voice, no forcing or pushing you, just giving you facts. Makes you feel very calm and wanting to do the exercises
- Never thought of using classical music for work outs, but WOW how lovely was that. It makes the whole thing so enjoyable. All the movements are controlled and slow, so you really do make those muscles work. I will now use classical music for my other work outs too, which I found so effective.
- It is beautifully made. No other people or props. The background is just beautiful and very faminine, which I loved. There are flowers, candles and cushions around and very tastfully done.
- Tracey appears like she definitely knows what she is doing and what she is talking about. Her approach is very confident and she makes you trust her.
- The workouts are slow and controlled, so if you are looking for aerobics, high paced workout, it is not for you. These exercises build up slowly in degrees and are quite hard, but I am thinking it would be possible to improve in time
- I think it might be very effective if done regularly 3-4 times a week.
Go on BUY it, it is a lovely looking DVD with a pleasant confident lady and gorgeous music and background atmosphere. It is very well made.
Hope you enjoy it as much as I did and I only just got it. Will be sticking with it, as it did make me feel like I was enjoying it and not something I am dreading.",1223856000,16,1458,4.286231884057971
3562574,5,B001F2APHU,"I purchased this out of curiosity and am so glad I did. I really like Tracy Anderson, and this is my favorite right now of her DVD's. I haven't had a baby yet, but have always battled my belly. This DVD really focuses in on the abs and is great for anyone. I also see room for growth by perfecting form. There are a variety of ab exercises that hit every angle including crunches, pikes, and planks. The leg and arm series are shorter than her mat workout but just as tough. There are many things I love about this DVD:
-tough workout in 47 minutes
-classical background music adds a lovely vibe
-fun, I look forward to doing it
- minimal talking
The only thing I would add is chaptering so you could just do a specific section in a time crunch. I'll buy anything Tracy puts out. I'd love her to make a shorter DVD focusing on butt, hips, and legs. That being said, if you like ballet/barre type workouts this is unique and challenging. I'm an exercise DVD junkie and can't control myself from reaching for this one the most.",1223251200,110,1025,4.316062176165803
3562575,4,B001F2APHU,"I just got this video after seeing Tracy on Oprah.  I had my 2nd baby 5 months ago and am trying to get back to my pre-1st baby weight.

Pluses:
- Great encouraging tone and instruction
- New ab, leg and arm exercised that I was not familiar with
- Seems like it is going to be effective (since I could feel my muscles while doing it)
- Classical music in the background rather than obnoxious techno or pop

What you need to know before purchasing:
- You need 3 lb weights.  (I did it without them, but Tracy uses them on and off in the video)
- No cardio
- The actual workout (including warm-up and cool-down) is around 50 minutes.",1222905600,308,632,4.155737704918033

It is also hard to follow since she doesn't talk much and tell you when to switch sides, etc. I am able to do the ab exercises but the leg part is a little obfuscating and I'm not 100% sure I am doing them correctly.
