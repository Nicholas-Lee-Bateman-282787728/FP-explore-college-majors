8697212,4,B00S2XXWZM,"This is a really good and intense workout.  However, if you are not very fit, have a mobility issue, are very overweight, or an absolute beginner, you will not be able to do this workout.  Many of the exercises involve plyometrics (jumping), advanced balanced exercises and complicated floor work.  The video has NO modifications except for one move (renegade lifts).

I took one star away because this is marketed toward the middle aged and senior person, and unless the person is really fit, most middle-aged and seniors won't be able to do the workout until they get fitter.  However, if you're already fit, or you regularly do cross fit, this is a great workout.",1528848000,2,666,4.807017543859649
