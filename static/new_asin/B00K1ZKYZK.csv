8655230,5,B00K1ZKYZK,"I purchased Sidekicks almost three years ago and paid $150 for it. It was worth every penny. I would have gladly paid much more.
But I guess thats the difference between a true fan and collector and someone who just wants to by a movie
Now on to the review......Barry Gabrewski (Jonathan Brandis) is an asthmatic high school student who is bullied by the school jerk. He learns the art of karate, self confidence and discipline from a wise old cook. (Mako). Oh, he also gets a bit of help from his hero Chuck Norris, who appears as himself. Barry and Chuck embark on a series of adventures and rescue the heroine in distress.  Their adventured sulminate age the Texas open karate championship. The ending will surprise you.
Beau Bridges plays Barrys clueless and somewhat inattentive father. Jonathan once said that Beau Bridges was his favorite actor. Joe Piscopo appears as pompous, arrogant, self absorbed and sometimes stupid karate master of another dojo. He gets exactly what he deserves.
Richard Moll gives a solid performance as the Nazi like gym teacher. He has one of my favourite lines in the movie.
Julia Nickson Soul appears as one of Barrys teachers.  She would later appear with Jonathan in the series finale of seaQuest.
So, if you want to add a cult classic, starring a great actor who left us much too soon, quit your kvetching, pony up the bucks and buy Siodekicks.
If not, shut the hell up and watch it on YouTube.",1529625600,,1434,4.686507936507937
