2063306,5,B00026DJQO,"Very good scifi film performed by Joan Collins.
I was looking for this film (at last on CD) since several years ago.
The story is a mix of science, fiction and love.",1304640000,3,165,4.1875
2063307,5,B00026DJQO,"I am happy that Amazon.com has decided to release this film on DVD, despite it being little known and underestimated.

It is a love story with a remarkable sci-fi twist to it. It is an old British movie ( 1971) made by that,then well known Producer-Director combination of Betty Box and Ralph Thomas. With no special effects, stunts or violence, it is a 'thinking persons' film and is very imaginative and effective.

Without divulging too much of the story, it deals with a Nuclear Physicist transported to a parallel universe following an uncontrolled experiment with a Particle Accelerator. Both universes are based in London in 1971, but in the parallel universe he is a playwright.

This other London in 1971 had not experienced World War II. The layout of the city is the same but technological and medical advances seem to be lagging slightly behind the London in the our Universe. Could it be a hint that the war stimulated faster development after the initial destruction?

The new social relationships and how he tries to adapt to the new setting is fascinating, with good direction, screen play, and very good acting by Joan Collins, Tom Bell, Denholm Elliot and host of minor actors who traditionally made a success of these old British films.

This DVD will rate 5 stars very deservedly.

2063308,5,B00026DJQO,"This is one of my favorite movies.  Joan Collins is at the height of her beauty and absolutely stunning.
Unfortunately I have only seen the film on commercial TV and would not be surprised if I heard that vital parts of it were left out, creating some gaps in its logic.
I would love to purchase the complete movie on DVD.  If anybody hears if it is available, please let me know.",1257465600,,380,4.263888888888889
2063309,4,B00026DJQO,"More than a cliched love story, this movie actually has a highly original sci-fi concept with something rare in the genre - strong human characters.  A physicist experimenting with a new particle accelerator is accidentally transported into a parallel universe in which he is instead a bestselling novelist, has a wife (played by Joan Collins), and must put up with some very strange differences (such as the fact that Kennedy was never assassinated and Britain was never air-raided by the Nazis during WWII).  He falls in love with Collins' character while he is there, but there are further complications when he returns to the real world which I won't reveal.  An entertaining movie, and you can tell there was a real mind behind it.",1139443200,6,736,4.919354838709677

8022662,5,B00026DJQO,"Yes, I give Quest for Love five stars. But before you rush to buy, rent, download or steal a copy accept it's five stars for an English movie from 1971 that may not suit modern tastes.

Even as a child I loved science fiction and I saw this when I was still quite young.  It's based on a short story by John Wyndham (author of Day of the Triffids). Parallel universes with alternate histories aren't the usual basis for a light romantic drama, but here they are the drama that leads our hero into the arms of the woman he never knew he loved.

The romantic element is the driving thrust of this movie, although there are some interesting 'what if' questions that go unanswered with lots of opportunity to discuss after you've seen the film.  Leading man Tom Bell plays his part as physicist turn author/playwright with a light touch and Joan Collins turns in a performance that may surprise you with it's subtlety.",1416614400,,914,4.5212121212121215
8022663,5,B00026DJQO,long been one of my favorite movies.  not a great movie by some standards but enjoyable to watch and I like alternate worlds.,1396396800,,125,4.434782608695652
8022664,3,B00026DJQO,"Nothing too much to say.  It was an OK movie...not great.  It started out interesting for me because I am always intrigued by ""time-travel"" stories.  But halfway into the movie, I was waiting for it to be over.  I think the story line falls flat after the first half hour or so.  I found myself fast-forwarding through to see what the outcome would finally be.

Joan Collins did turn in an excellent performance.",1379030400,,412,4.575342465753424
8022665,4,B00026DJQO,"I saw this movie 39 years ago and have wanted to see it again ever since.  I always missed it when it was on TV and finally I discovered I could search for it on the internet - and there it was!!  I want to know where I can find the beautiful music that Joan Collins is playing on the piano before she dies.  If you know it, please comment.'",1360972800,,341,3.842857142857143
8022666,5,B00026DJQO,"If you are a true Sci Fi fan, enjoy the old parallel universe story, this is the movie for you. It stars Joan Collins-how much better can it get. A true classic that is rarely seen on TV or Cable.",1356393600,2,196,3.925
8022667,5,B00026DJQO,"I've loved this movie ever since I saw it on TV in the early '80's. I found the short story in the library, but the movie was better. It's an unusual sci-fi time travel romance. As an ex-Pan Am stewardess, I related to the modern day portion of the story. I found several bootleg copies on the internet, but I never thought it would be produced on DVD since I felt the market would be limited to the few people who know the movie. It's definitely a sleeper! I also loved the soundtrack, which I would buy if it was also produced on a CD. Buy the movie! If you're a romantic, you won't be disappointed.",1354838400,3,601,4.189655172413793
8022668,5,B00026DJQO,"Thanks to Scorpion for releasing this DVD. I had an Australian DVD of this film, but the color was even more washed out than this print. I think, based on a print I saw on TV in the late 70's, that this is the best this film is ever going to look. Joan Collins gives one of her best performances. This is a love story, and a sweet one at that. A simple film really, that deserves a wider audience that it will receive when categorized as ""science fiction"". The film features a hauntingly beautiful musical theme, which has never been made available on CD. If anyone knows of an MP3 version, please advise. It is just wonderful, as is this movie.",1319241600,2,645,4.295081967213115
8022669,1,B00026DJQO,"I'm a fan of Scorpion Releasing and most everything they release.  Their DVDs are usually great looking and filled with informative/entertaining extras, so I was eager to check out Quest for Love!  I'm a long time collector and own over 2000 DVDs/BDs - I watch all of my DVDs on a 46"" LCD/HDTV and have an Oppo blu-ray upconverting blu-ray player.  Most everything looks excellent on my setup.  This DVD, however, looks awful.  There are some serious motion problems that may be due to some PAL to NTSC conversion issues?  Every bit of motion contained choppy and jerky, slightly blurry movements.  I attempted adjusting all of the settings on the TV and Blu-Ray player, and even tried playing it on an older DVD player.  Nothing worked, and the motion problems persisted.

Perhaps the other reviewers are watching this on an old style TV that hides these motion problems?  I have yet to read any review that mentions this issue, so I thought maybe I had a bad disc.  I contacted Scorpion Releasing and never received a response so I just sold the used disc on here.  It's a shame because I've never had an issue with any other Scorpion DVD (well, except for Point of Terror, but that's another review!) and I really wanted to watch this film!",1318636800,,1243,4.651376146788991
8022670,5,B00026DJQO,"I had last seen this film in, I believe , 1971 when it first came out!  A wonderful romantic and beautifully acted film, very touchingly filmed.  I have wanted to see this film again for 40 years!  I finally got to show it to my wife, who enjoyed it as well!  This film is one in a small handful of romantic sci-fi films, like ""Somewhere in Time"", and ""Portrait of Jennie"".  A very worthwhile film indeed!  ( Now if someone will release ""What's So Bad About Feeling Good?"" on DVD  my romantic sci-fi collection will be very happy)!",1315180800,3,531,4.357142857142857
