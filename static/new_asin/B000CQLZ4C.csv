2469045,5,B000CQLZ4C,"I liked this film a lot. It was dark, funny, and offbeat, unlike most of the pre-packaged studio drivel being produced these days.",1213056000,3,130,4.695652173913044
8100369,5,B000CQLZ4C,"I enjoyed it. It was something different and funny. I liked the plot twist and the ending. Yes, I kind of wondered what happened to the Mom but that seemed beside the point. This is one of the first independent films Ive really seen and I enjoyed it very much. Thought the growing relationship between guy and girl was cute ... especially how guy softened up at the end. All you need is Love.
Thanks Marc for recommending - Bri from Deluxe!",1515801600,,440,4.378048780487805

8100371,1,B000CQLZ4C,I thought it was trash and did not even go through 10 minutes of it!,1463702400,,68,3.6
8100372,4,B000CQLZ4C,"Pretty good film! Set in a typical small town, complete with lore of missing money from a bank robbery, this film moves along easily. The dialogue is typical for terribly cynical people that see each other every day and have mundane lives which gives the charm to this movie. Nothing weird or unexpected happens, but the story isn't typical at all.
New drinking game, every time the characters say something cynical, take a shot. You will be glad you don't live in Bedford Springs.",1457308800,,481,4.738095238095238

8100374,2,B000CQLZ4C,Weird Plot! Marc seems like a good actor but the rest B actors and actresses,1437696000,,76,4.133333333333334
8100375,1,B000CQLZ4C,lame. bailed after 25 mins.,1425427200,,27,4.6
8100376,3,B000CQLZ4C,"Long, kinda slow, did not hate it so I was feeling kind of generous. The movie description doesn't really describe the movie.",1422748800,,125,4.7272727272727275
8100377,4,B000CQLZ4C,Great acting throughout.  Obviously a low budget production but a very interesting yet simple plot.,1416960000,,99,5.6
8100378,1,B000CQLZ4C,"I didn't care for this film very much. I wish independents would get the idea that people do want to see good films, even if they are a bit slow, or take awhile to carry out the story line. I wanted to like this movie, but it never did go anywhere really. I got tired of listening to this character's whining. Constant complaints got old, and the dialogue lacked imagination. This guy was not all that likeable anyway, and never did get much better. I guess by the end he was a bit changed, but by then I no longer cared. Phrases like ""deal with it"" or ""grow up dude"" kept coming to mind. Along with ""loser"", ""deadbeat"", ""lazy"", and ""so you think the world owes you?"". The friend's Mom, and what they do with her is unnecessary, and you are left wondering about her, and if there really is a point to this movie.
I can't think of any reason to recommend it to anyone.",1357257600,,867,4.228915662650603
