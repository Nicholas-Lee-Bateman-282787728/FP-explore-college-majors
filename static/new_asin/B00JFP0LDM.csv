6356672,1,B00JFP0LDM,The quality of these videos is TERRIBLE!,1409788800,4,40,4.857142857142857
6356673,4,B00JFP0LDM,"This show is hilarious and I'm over the moon that I can actually purchase it. However aside from the horribly cheap packaging which is standard for made-on-demand dvdrs from amazon, the image quality leaves a lot to be desired. It is not dvd quality. This show is from 2006. the quality should be pristine and crystal clear. It is dvd quality pre-HD, that's for sure.",1407369600,7,367,4.661538461538462
6356674,5,B00JFP0LDM,Great show loved that it came out on DVD great class of actors lol,1406678400,,66,3.7857142857142856
6356675,5,B00JFP0LDM,This show has a great cast and writers. Can't understand why it wasn't renewed. It does leave you wanting more. It is funny and romantic.,1401494400,,137,4.52
6356676,5,B00JFP0LDM,"a favorite TV show I thought I'd never get to see again, was so happy to find there was a DVD out there.",1454803200,,104,3.5652173913043477
6356677,5,B00JFP0LDM,I love this show! Bummer that it wasn't given a chance...So much better than most of the sitcoms on TV!,1448755200,,103,4.2
6356678,4,B00JFP0LDM,"Purchased it on recommendations that ""the class"" is a great one season series (love Wonderfalls, Firefly, etc.)  It started slow, and isn't the quality of script or acting that a series like Firefly gave me, but it grew on me and by the last episode...I wanted more.  Sigh.  So I'm between a ""like it"" and a ""love it"".",1444953600,,318,4.448275862068965
6356679,5,B00JFP0LDM,"Awesome, my kind of humor",1439942400,,25,4.2
6356680,5,B00JFP0LDM,"If you love comedies, this is a great one to watch. We couldn't believe that they ended this show after the 1st season. Can't quite remember but I actually don't think it made it through a full season.
It ranks right up there with The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family. Don't know why the network didn't renew it. Well worth owning and watching.",1425945600,,345,4.40625
6356681,5,B00JFP0LDM,"I loved this show and I think it even won a People's Choice award for best new comedy.  If I remember correctly it was cancelled because CBS wanted to keep ""Rules of Engagement"" because of it's higher profile cast instead and there wasn't room on their schedule for both.  Maybe I am overreacting but I never watched ""Rules of Engagement"" for spite and I now could care less about the People's Choice awards (not that I ever really cared for award shows) because they obviously carry no weight in what a network carries.  This show was cancelled too soon just like Freaks and Geeks, Firefly and also it looks like McCarthy's is also on its way out after only one season.  I guess they have to make room for more reality trash these days.

I didn't buy the DVD because I am worried about the quality issues others have mentioned.",1425340800,3,828,4.493333333333333
6356682,5,B00JFP0LDM,The greatest season of an unknown sitcom ever! Video quality is fine.,1424563200,,69,4.833333333333333
6356683,4,B00JFP0LDM,This show was a hell of a lot of fun! In some episodes much better than many of the Friends episodes! It's a shame the network didn't have enough faith in it!,1423526400,,158,3.96875
6356684,5,B00JFP0LDM,"Loved this series and loved to finally have it on DVD.  Quality is very good, watched on my 47"" HDTV and was clear and sound quality was great.  A definite recommend for anyone who loved this one season series.",1418083200,2,210,4.358974358974359
6356685,5,B00JFP0LDM,One of the best comedy shows EVER!  America lost a great cast and non-stop laughs by cutting this one short.  Glad to see this one out on DVD...FINALLY!!!,1417392000,,154,4.464285714285714
8650592,3,B00JFP0LDM,"Love this show, but EXTREMELY Disappointed, as the last four episodes on disc 2 don't play.  Really dissatisfied, as I was unable to watch all the episodes until now, outside of the return window.",1525132800,,196,4.764705882352941
8650593,5,B00JFP0LDM,"A great show that should  not have been Cancelled. Ive Looked For This Show Kn Dvd For Years, So Glad It Finally Came Out........Jason Ritter Heads Up An Amazing, Hysterically Funny Cast......Get This Dvd",1522108800,,204,5.0
8650594,5,B00JFP0LDM,"CBS really blew it by canceling this series. It was very well-written and acted. The show had so many characters, that it can very challenging to juggle them within a 22 minute time allotment. I had watched it when it had aired on CBS and am enjoying it thoroughly on DVD. This show had strong potential. CBS tossed it out. Other networks should have picked it up.",1520208000,,364,4.447761194029851
8650595,5,B00JFP0LDM,Great series. Too bad only 1 season. Very good!,1517270400,,47,4.333333333333333
8650596,5,B00JFP0LDM,"I absolutely loved this show when it aired.  The premise and writing is crisp, refreshing, funny, and hilarious.  A chance to see some actors who have continued with fabulous careers.  I wish it had become a regular series, but enjoyed seeing it again!",1502841600,,252,4.813953488372093

8650598,5,B00JFP0LDM,ONE OF THE BEST SERIES EVER MADE,1478908800,,32,3.7142857142857144
8650599,5,B00JFP0LDM,So cool to see so much of this cast has gone on to even bigger things.  Sadly it means I'll never get the ending to this show even in a reunion episode.  :(,1463097600,,156,3.696969696969697
8650600,5,B00JFP0LDM,"Amazing show with great heart, and Jon Bernthal, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Lizzy Kaplan. You can't lose watching this",1461888000,,116,5.157894736842105
