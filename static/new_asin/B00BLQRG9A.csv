5646834,2,B00BLQRG9A,"To me this series kind of felt like you were being dropped into it two or three seasons in.  Some episodes felt out of order as well, and the whole season felt rushed because of it being only 13 episodes.  Just wasn't something that I could get interested in, but your mileage might vary.  I would however recommend you see a episode or two before buying.",1400544000,,355,4.348484848484849

5646840,5,B00BLQRG9A,I finally watched both seasons and its alright in my opinion a prefer a good plot with straightforward action and none of the silly hijinks but its pretty good still,1372982400,3,165,4.533333333333333
5646841,5,B00BLQRG9A,"Based on a video game series that itself turned Japanese history into a comic book, this is the coolest anime show I've seen in quite some time. You see, the ""Sengoku"" of the title refers to the ""Sengoku"" or ""Warring States"" period of Japanese history, which lasted over 100 years and saw constant battle as numerous factions fought for territory and control. Several of the characters are even based on actual people...but here they are given flashy, colorful outfits that make them look like medieval superheroes/villains, weild badass kung-fu weapons, have nicknames like ""One-Eyed Dragon"", ""Tiger of Kai"" and ""The Devil King"", spout dialogue that sounds like Shakespeare on testosterone(it's cooler than it sounds), and use DBZ-style super powered martial-arts moves that defy the laws of physics. One character even has a motorcycle handle bars and exhaust pipes on his horse! If you think that sounds over the top...well, that's the whole idea.

I'll admit that some of the characters are fairly shallow (a couple don't even have any personality at all), but given the source material (the SB games have more action than plot) and that the series is so short & so crowded, it does good with what it's got. And its good points more than make up for its flaws. It has beautiful animation, high octane action scenes, good character moments between the mayhem, and even provides equal opportunity fan service (not only are there men with handsome/pretty faces and great bodies, it throws in a few hot babes, chiefly a well endowed ninja chick with a costume that also defies the laws of physics)! And really, you cant ask for much more than that in a good anime show.",1372118400,12,1669,4.897526501766785
