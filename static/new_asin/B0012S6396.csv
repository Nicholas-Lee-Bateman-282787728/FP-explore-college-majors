8247588,5,B0012S6396,"This documentary was very informative.  It gives you a perspective on how the Stasi was organized and how the iron curtain worked.  How did the government retain control?  This documentary provides that piece of missing evidence in the organizational structure.  It shows that a grand conspiracy that involves half the people is possible.  How do you shut everyone up?  Have everyone spying on everyone.  This should be required viewing for school children instead of most of the uselessness they teach children today.  The parallels between modern surveillance systems and networks and that of the Stasi are scarily eerie, except the East Germans knew it was going on.",1477353600,,669,5.186915887850467

8247591,5,B0012S6396,"I read this book a while ago.  When I was living in post-war East Germany, I was approached and threatened by Stasi employees.  So, I had to read this book.  This book showed how powerful the Stasi organization has been.  Was good reading.",1371859200,,239,4.488372093023256

8247593,5,B0012S6396,"This DVD is fantastic! I am a MS & HS German teacher and found this DVD both informative and interesting. It offers the content in both English & German and offers subtitles in both languages as well, making it an excellent resource for any level of learner. The image quality, sound track, and information about the Stasi are all of high quality. This DVD is more than worth the price (especially considering the difficulty of finding ANY region 1 DVDs that can still play German language...not to mention having to pay a small fortune for them!) I highly recommend not only this DVD, but also their other DVD (""Freedom's Frontier""), and I would confidently buy any other product from this company.",1210896000,12,699,4.785123966942149
