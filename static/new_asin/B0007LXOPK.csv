2219505,5,B0007LXOPK,"The ""chicks with guns"" anime genre is a rather crowded field often loaded with shows that are either plotless action driven affairs or shows crammed with mindless fan service and stupid jokes. ""Gunslinger Girl"" is one of the few shows that rises above these conventions with its focus on the young cybernetic girls and their relationships with their handlers.

The basic premise for the show is that a special agency in the Italian government has used a new scientific technique to brainwash and condition people to train them into killers. The technique is more successful the younger the recruit. Using young orphans girls to under ""conditioning"" the girls are then handed off to agent who are called ""handlers"" who will oversee that the girls become trained killers.

The show has its share of particularly violent and graphic action sequences stemming from various missions the girls undertake. However the missions are more of a backdrop to exploring the relationship each girl has with her handler. Henrietta has a father figure type handler in Joze who is very kind to her. In contrast another character Rico has a very abusive handler, Jean who is critical of her performance and very rarely gives the praise she so desires.

The episodes on the fisrt disc devote one episode to each character to introduce to their personality and tell us about their past. The storytelling is slow but really pulls you in with its characterization and the beautiful piano heavy background music.

Its unclear if the future discs are building up to a major story arc or if the pacing will stay self contained episodes. Fans looking for non-stop action heavy on the jokes and fan service may need to look elsewhere. Anime fans who are looking for something a bit introspective done beautifully might want to consider adding this to their collection.

THe starter set is particularly a great buy. Coming packaged with a nice box and a BEAUTIFUL silk screened banner makes this a worthwhile purchase.",1116720000,34,1989,4.960960960960961
2219506,5,B0007LXOPK,"I must start off saying this anime was everything I had hoped it to be...I was concerned that FUNIMATION which doesn't have a good track record for making good english adaptions in the past,had me worried, but this adaption is top grade all the way! I prefer my anime rooted in contemporary settings as a rule, I don't mind sci-fi or fantasy,but i like someething rooted in reality. Gunslinger Girl's 14 episodes succeeds where NOIR failed, this show captivates and draws you into the story. The 5 girls of the story each have a sad tale to reveal , and this show will one by one delve into their pasts. In vol. 1  Henrietta is the victim of a trauma and murder of her family that would ruin anyone her age for life. The benevolent Italian government comes along and wipes away her past and gives her a new life as a asassin. You might think it's wrong to brainwash little girls into doing political murders, but compared to her previous fate, she was very fortunate. One interesting aspect is that the series never becomes cliched by trying to help Henrietta realise revenge on her familie's murderer, if this were a american storyline, Henrietta would be going KILL BILL on the men responsible for hurting her. Instead G.G. tells the story of the men chosen to mentor the 5 girls, and how the girls deal with their situation in life. It must be noted that the opening song for the series, is one of the best tunes to come along in a long time to any anime series. Please if you ever enjoyed the likes of CRYING FREEMAN or GOLGO 13: The Professional, or KITE, do find yourself in front of Gunslinger Girl Vol. 1 and enjoy a new classic of the genre.",1116633600,4,1650,4.445544554455446
2219507,5,B0007LXOPK,"I'm really just now getting into anime and really haven't ever really strayed from the Miyazaki films (Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service). I was at work one day and was reading the anime section of PLAY magazine and saw they gave it a 8.5 and thought I'd check it out. One word: GREATNESS. This is a very good series. For the record, I can't see how this got TV14, it's not very graphic but still point-blank headshots is very violent. By far the best episode is episode 3 (Boy), where Rico says ""I am Sorry"". This is very good and I recommend it highly to anyone who likes anime.",1116547200,2,585,4.376146788990826

2219509,5,B0007LXOPK,"In the DVD, you get to see how an adult man has gained a pre-adolescent girl's total trust by being her supervisor and could abuse it whenever he pleases.

It is about Henrietta, a preteen cyborg assasin with a heart of a young prepubescent girl. She uses guns and kills lots of terrorists with little or no remorse. She can kill a man with her bare hands. She speaks three languages. She does bleed but her pain goes away. But when she reaches puberty, she begins to experience young womanhood, lust, love, jealousy, affection and femininity, etc.",1116115200,,548,4.649484536082475
2219510,4,B0007LXOPK,"This is a show about pubescent female cyborgs.  Fortunately, it is much more interesting than such a description would normally warrant (random bishojos bleating 'onii-san' left and right, creepy fan service of 12 year old girls, etc.).  Instead, this is a dark and somewhat disturbing series.  The 'artificial girls' in question are normal girls who have been broken  mentally and physically, and then acquired by an agency of the italian government.  They are each then bonded to an adult male operative via heavy psychological and chemical conditioning in order to insure absolute loyalty.  This conditioning, when combined with the replacement of much of their bodies with synthetic parts, leaves them somewhat unstable mentally, and severely shortens their lifespans.  They are then eager to carry out any mission required of them by their 'supervisor', usually along the lines of killing large numbers of people.  There really isn't much action in this show- it is more about each of the artificial girls, their respective supervisors, and how they all cope with the decidedly less than happy premise of this series.",1115856000,4,1122,5.264044943820225
2219521,4,B0007LXOPK,"Watching Gunslinger Girl, the viewer will come to realize that this isn't the standard ""good-versus-evil"" type of Anime. In fact, every character in this beautifully animated series is pretty ethically challenged.

The plot: Little girls who have been victims of terrible crimes get turned into cyborg assasins by the nefarious ""Social Welfare Agency"".

The girls conditioning makes them effective killers who don't hesitate to pull the trigger on anyone. Their adult handlers treat them like gun-toting machines during training and missions, then like their daughters - rewarding them with perfume and ice cream when they ""do well"".

Questions arise: Are the girls killing the ""right"" people, does anyone care? What happens when the girls grow up, if they grow up? Are the girls simply killing machines with human brains or something more?

These answers to these questions are what make this series very interesting. Well worth buying.",1139184000,3,937,5.35374149659864
2219522,5,B0007LXOPK,"This is simply the most wonderful anime series that you can buy. The graphics are to die for and the story is beautiful. Im not exaggerating, you simply have to get this, if your a true anime fan, then you'll know what I mean.",1135296000,,226,4.159090909090909
2219523,4,B0007LXOPK,"Girls, guns, robotics and violence are all parts of the Japanese canon when it comes to action-adventure anime.  Yu Aida's manga, brought to life through animation has plenty of these conventional elements.  Dying girls are given a new chance at life; their memories wiped away, their bodies enhanced to create a unit of highly deadly assassins. Each new cyborg girl is paired with a trainer/brother to deadly effect within a world of terrorists, intrigue and warring political factions.  And there's certainly blood and violence in this anime-but it's mostly used as a backdrop to what turns out to be a surprisingly deep psychological exploration.

Disc 1 features the first five episodes of this thirteen episode series.  Rather than a developing plotline, these five episodes are character portraits, exploring each cyborg and her particular relationship with her handler.  This anime is definitely not for those looking for an action-packed fight fest with bullets constantly flying or full of scenes of high emotional outbursts.  The story is a portrait innocence and violence-the unspoken, but acknowledged horror of transforming these children into killing machines, and the strange innocence, and at times inhumanity, of the girls themselves. The emotional energy of this anime is as controlled as the girls themselves.  There are no exaggerated takes, no crying scenes.  There are no inadvertent panty flashes or seduction scenes-no chibi moments.  Small smiles and frowns dominate the emotional landscape, but become much more powerful for their restraint.

  From the haunting images of the girls themselves-going from stillness to a sudden flurry of movement-to the lovingly detailed guns and ammo that are the girls' constant accessories the animation is superb and subtle.  Little things stand out:  Henrietta's delicate handling of a teacup,  Rico raising her handgun, Triela's outright defiance of her handler. The acoustic violin music that accompanies many of the scenes underscores the sense of bitter sweetness and starkness that imbues the movie.  And the voice acting and sound effects blend seamlessly to create a true work of art.  It is possible that the story arc will gain momentum from this introductory volume to come up with an interesting storyline for our heroines--with so little in this story that's not conventional, it may be difficult to pull off this manga series, but it has potential.

The first two episodes of this series are a bit slow moving and the flashbacks, while subtly different from the original viewing, are still a bit longer than necessary.  Once past the first two, the story really starts to pick up and the viewer will begin to really see into the characters.  The show has a lot of potential, but I'm unsure yet where the storyline is going. I do admit that I liked the manga version a bit better than the anime version of this particular story-the story seems to flow a little more easily.  A few negatives about this DVD: the font size is a bit small and hard to read, particularly for someone with vision trouble.  Also, the subtitles don't always translate properly-there are a few clumsy sentences that readers can figure out what was meant, but could have been written more clearly.

 This is a decent action/drama anime containing moderate violence, minimal sexual reference and no graphic sexuality.  No chibi cuteness and plenty of realistic weaponry.  But be aware that the psychological explorations certainly mean this anime is for a mature audience and may not be appropriate for the preteen reader.  Viewers who enjoy this DVD may want to check out disc 2 and 3 of Gunslinger Girl, as well as the DVD Noir.

Happy Viewing! ^_^ Shanshad",1132444800,3,3708,5.123128119800333

2219526,5,B0007LXOPK,"Sure, the ""girls with guns"" theme will always cause an anime fan to raise an eyebrow. I was curious as to what Gunslinger Girl would offer me. I bought the series not sure what to expect. I was very surprised.

This series caught me off guard from an emotional point of view. I quickly grew attached to Henrietta's character after learning about her background. I think it's hard to not feel for at least one of the girls since they are basically society's rejected, helpless, or tragic victims. I found this series to be very emotional and moving. I absolutely loved it.

The thing that I was surprised the most is how the enjoyment came not from the action but the character interaction between the Handlers and girls. They are paired as a brother/sister (Fratello) team with each Handler responsible for the training and condition of each girl. This series explores the cause and effect of each pair as each Handler has his own way of dealing with their respective girl.

As for the animation, it is superb. They characters are very well drawn. They are sharp and extremely detailed, especially the guns they use. The setting in Italy is well drawn and is a refreshing change from the usual Neo-Tokyo or feudal Japan settings I am accustomed to seeing. The action is used sparingly but explosive in execution.

The music creates a beautiful melancholic soundscape which mates perfectly to the scenery. Also, the OP ""Light Before We Land"" is simply the best I have ever heard for a series. It's beautiful because it's lyrics AND music describe this series accurately. It's a very moving piece and I too have purchased the song once I heard it. I always relate the song to Gunslinger Girl when I listen to it now.

This series is a work or art...both in story and animation. Get the starter Box set as well. It's gorgeous and the banner is beautiful. Highly Recommended!",1126483200,3,1871,4.692073170731708

Having said that, -Gunslinger Girl- is nice. The stories are good, the missions plausible, but moreover, the characterization and relationships make the story. The viewer finds the basic arc of the story, but also the texture and plot complications that make a good tale.

2219530,4,B0007LXOPK,"I do not purchase anime all the time, my own library being rather small in comparison to the amount I've seen. I rented up Gunslinger Girls after seeing some artwork done by my one of my favorite amature artists, Sandara. Sandara, having always had wonderful taste in anime, surely did not disappoint me this time around.

At first, I was a bit skeptical- I mean, c'mon, killer girls, guns, and government support. How cliche! But my initial inclination was rather wrong. Each girl has their merits and flaws, a unique relationship with their handlers, and indepth stories behind not just the girls, but the various men who train them. Their is a tension of shorter lives, living it to the fullest within restrictions, and the pressures of their strange situation.

I'm now considering purchasing this series for my own collection as I want to rewatch episodes and share them with my friends. Anyone who perhaps enjoyed Ghost in the Shell or Elfen Lied would probably enjoy this as the actual missions and actions are at most parallel or, as another put it, the backdrop to a more indepth and intriguing story.",1124064000,,1110,4.806282722513089
2219535,5,B0007LXOPK,"I've already seen the first two disks, so I'll just comment on the first.

First off, just like with all the other comments, this is very close to a piece of art as you can get with Anime.  The animation is very crisp and smooth,  and it has a very clean look to it throughout the series.  The weapons and sounds of the guns are very well done in that they sound like their real life counterparts.  I just wish some of the video games out there had the same kind of attention to detail as Gunslinger Girl has gone into.

The one thing that people complain about is the lack of storyline.  In the first disk at least, there really isn't a main organization that is being fought;  however, the story is what training and hardships the girls have to endure.  The handlers all have a different way that they treat the girls and that is one of the main themes of the first five episodes.

The sound is fantastic!  Again, the attention to detail is unreal!  The music is of the classical variety, but being that it takes place in Italy, it really adds a good feel to the anime.  The opening theme ""Light Before We Land"" by the Delgados is nothing short of AWESOME!!!  I went and got the CD from Amazon as soon as I heard it!

If you like more of the art feel to your anime, than you can't go wrong with Gunslinger Girl.  Don't get me wrong, there is your fair share of action, but it's just not as much as you would think with a name like Gunslinger Girl.  I give it five stars all the way!!!",1123459200,2,1486,4.157894736842105
2219536,4,B0007LXOPK,"The Social Welfare Agency is a clandestine government branch that takes in young girls who are terminally ill or otherwise unable to live a normal life.  Secretly, they are rehabilitated through the use of cybernetic implants and trained to be assassins or be involved in other often lethal covert operations.

It's a rather far-fetched premise, but if you can get over the general implausibility this is a highly enjoyable series.  Far from being the non-stop action show one might expect, it is actually surprisingly gentle and introspective.  A substantial amount of time is spent behind the scenes, examining the girls' relationships with their handlers (who usually act as ""big brothers"") and with each other.  Characterization is solid, and you really care about these girls and their problems.  One of them has trouble controlling her aggressive tendencies; another loses her trainer to a random accident and must confront her sudden lack of purpose in life.  There is genuine sadness, such as when one of the girls is forced to kill a witness she befriended earlier in the story.  To be honest, I didn't expect this much depth, so I was pleasantly surprised.  After the first two episodes, a different girl becomes central to each.

This volume contains five episodes and runs just under two hours.  The show is presented in widescreen with both English (5:1 stereo) and Japanese (2:1) soundtracks available.  Subtitles are white and smaller than usual, but still readable.  Extras include dossier files on each of the girls featured on this disc (the last girl, who has not yet been introduced, is not accessible here), clean (textless) opening and closing sequences, a neat little animation showing the layers of art that go into creating just one still figure, and trailers for this and other Funimation releases.",1123113600,9,1824,5.101010101010101
2219537,5,B0007LXOPK,"I'd like to start by saying that this is one of my favorite anime series.  Though some have criticized it on the grounds of being light on plot, to do so is essentially to entirely miss the point of the anime.  It's true that there are no dark conspiracies to unravel, no evil empires or terrorist organizations to topple, in fact, no real thematic thread running through the series, but that is because this anime is about the characters.  The series sets up an interesting premise, sets down a small cast of characters, and then lets them live out their lives while we watch.  There is a genuine attempt to deal with the issues that would be created by taking a young girl and turning her into an unstoppable killing machine, both for the girl and those around her in a fairly thoughtful manner, and though most of the characters are quiet and understated, they have a depth that the series does a good job of exploring.  This is not a series for those looking for a mindless action anime, but for those who want to use the grey matter between their ears a bit, it's a great way to spend a few hours.",1122854400,4,1102,4.382352941176471
2219538,5,B0007LXOPK,"The box and all of the promo literature refers to this as ""The Professional"" only with little girls. I thought that it was more of a Point of No Return(Bridget Fonda movie) anime style. Basically, little girls who are at deaths door are turned over to government operatives to save their lives, only to make them assassins. There is a lot of inner turmoil with the girls and their trainers. I thought that the first two episodes could have been combined to make one. Overall, it was an interesting anime. Anime fans know what genre they enjoy. If you like to see little girls gun people down then this is for you. There are no robots or invading aliens. There is a lot of violence and betrayal and manipulation. This is a serious anime. The girls are cute, but are not ""cutesy"" or ""silly"".

Gunslinger Girl is the story of the members of Section 2, a top-secret government team in Italy. Section 2 is a subdivision of the social welfare agency; they take in orphaned or terminal kids (girls only), give them cybernetic implants and condition them to be government assassins.

The main characters are five young girls (Henrietta, Rico, Triella, Claes and Angelica) who have been taken in by Section 2 and given assasin training. Each girl is paired with a handler to train them - all of which are very interesting characters in their own right.

For those of you who are a fan of the manga, the first five episodes DO seem to be following the first two books.  Some stories have been skipped but as most are stand alone they could show up in later discs.  The extras include a dossier on each of the main female characters, opening and closing songs, trailers and more.

This is what I would call a serious anime - a work of art.  A few series try to reach the level of Gunslinger Girl, but while reaching greatness they fail to understand that the greatest mystery, the greatest part of the story, is the relationship between characters.  Lain, Cowboy Bebop, Witch Hunter Robin and Noir are up there, but they're all in a different class - they had different goals to set, to reach.

The story has a well defined and carried out plot with developing and likeable characters.  Young girls with great physical and mental damage are given another chance at living, if only to take the lives of those that are wanted dead by the goverment.

8048699,5,B0007LXOPK,"Gunslinger Girl ranks among the absolute best Anime series ever created. Thought provoking and at times heart-wrenching, Gunslinger Girl proves that Anime can be high art.

Taking place in modern Italy, the series follows the activities of ""the Social Welfare Agency"". On the surface, the SWA rehabilitates severely injured people with cybernetis body parts. Beneath the surface, the SWA uses some of these people to do the government's dirty work. The series focuses on the use, in particular, of young adolescent girls. Mainly because children are easier to ""condition"". Most of the girls were either fataly injured or born paralyzed.

Given cybernetically enhanced limbs and ""conditioned"" to be assassins, they must also deal with the realities of their emotional needs. The conditioning is a form of brainwashing which also shortens their lifespan. Each girl is given a male ""handler"" who trains and cares for them. Some handlers use as little conditioning as the SWA allows. Others are brutal toward their charge. Given the violent nature of being assassins, the issues with their handlers adds to the emotional weight of their situation.

Welcome to the Social Welfare Agency, a top secret part of the Italian government which, despite its name, has absolutely nothing to do with the Social Welfare of the nation's people. Instead, this agency deals with terrorists, the mob, and other such criminal organizations, by assassinating their leaders.

Now meet Harrietta, possibly the cutest little girl in the world, trained by the government to be the perfect killing machine, a weapon of war and destruction, a tool and nothing more. She is the perfect weapon, skilled in her trade, unquestionably devoted to her handler, Josay, able to go unnoticed because of her innocent and harmless appearance. After her parents were brutally murdered she was taken in by the Agency, her memory wiped clean, her organic body replaced with cyborg parts making her very much like Darth Vader from ""Star Wars"" or the Major from ""Ghost in the Shell"". She is a tool to be used and disposed of when her usefulness is done, but at the same time she is still the little girls she once was.

I've known about it since I started watching anime two years ago, but not until now have I had a chance to actually sit down and watch it. I thought I'd like it, after all sad and depressing anime's like ""Now and Then, Here"" and There"" and ""Grave of the Fireflies"" are among my all time favorites, but I had no idea how completely amazed I'd be with it.

Let's get the obvious out of the way; this is one shockingly grotesque show. Think about it, it's about little girls, some maybe as young as ten, being transformed from cute little school children into coldly efficient killing machines. Is there anything more disturbing then seeing a little pre adolescent girl wielding a machine gun and killing at will dozens of people? Is there anything sadder then said girl pleading to be allowed to do so again?
""I know I've only killed six people this month, but last month I killed at least twenty, so can't I come back to work?""

Although this show relies on its action and disturbing content early on to draw the viewer into the story, it doesn't dwell on it throughout the shows entirety. It isn't about the gun slinging at all, it's about the gunslingers and their handlers. None of the characters are wasted, especially the cyborg girls, each of whom received adequate detail to their characters and plenty of history. Herrietta, Triela, Ricko, Clide, Angelica, even the reclusive and barley mentioned Elsa (who looks a lot like Sara from ""Now and Then, Here and There"") were treated with just enough love and care to make their characters more then killing machines and into confused, emotional, and caring little girls simply doing their best to please those they love and feel needed. Their stories are the real meaning for this shows existence. One was born paralyzed; another was nearly killed by her parents who needed the insurance money. One by one their stories unfold. Each character has at least one episode devoted to them with Harrietta acting as the sometimes silent, sometimes active observer. Unlike other shows which try this approach, such as ""Air TV"", these characters aren't dropped once they've produced the desired emotional effect. They all have a part to play in this story; each one relies on the others in order for the show to move forward. They need each other. But despite the attention to detail put into each character, in the end its Harrietta's story. She is the common denominator which glues the characters and events to one another.

Where the emotional stories lie exclusively with the cyborg girls, the moral, ethical, and philosophical dilemmas are for the ""handlers,"" the men whose job it is to raise, train, supervise, and care for the girls, to deal with, and they are as different from one another as the girls they train. Josay, Harrietta's handler, feels guilty about the dehumanizing conditioning the girls are forced to go though and tries his best to alleviate that guilt by trading Harrietta as a little sister. He takes her on vacations to the Italian countryside, buys her expensive gifts, and tries his best to have her act as if she were a normal little girl. But deep down he knows that he, and the agency he serves, is merely using her as a tool; a means to an end. He deals with this guilt more and more as Herrietta's affection and emotional attachment to him grow stronger. He is a man torn between his duty and his love and affection for her.

Other handlers deal with their girls very differently. Some act cold and menacing towards their girls in order to instill fear and discipline, others simply treat then as if they were machines.
""They're cool and all; they can get you a soda if you ask them to, but it doesn't go beyond that to me.""
No matter what the approach they take, the girls always develop a strong emotional attachment to their handlers and desire their affection above all else, with devastating consequences sometimes.

The animation in this show may not be flashy, but it's more then adequate for a show of this nature. The battle scenes are done extremely well, as one would expect, as well as the stunning scenery of Italy. The characters are drawn as cute as possible to make their action all the more shocking. The music isn't worth making a big deal out of. Although the background music serves its purpose and sets the mood very effectively, it isn't something to listen to by itself. It's rather simplistic. The opening and closing songs are likewise less then noteworthy.

Gunslinger Girl is not a show to be missed. Although it is very much like Ghost in the Shell in regards to the philosophical questions it raises, the depth of its characters and the attention to detail the creators put into making them is well worth the time, energy, and money. It may not be the best anime ever made, but it certainly is one of them. Good to see a depressing anime that doesn't drop the ball at the end.

Questions to ponder while watching.
1. Is Josay, Harrietta's handler, a moral person? Is his using Harrietta as a tool negated by the fact that he tries to make her happy? If he makes Harrietta happy, is he still acting immorally by using her, as the agencies pawn, as a tool?
2. Are the girls really human? If so, then why? What is it that makes them still human beings?
3. Do the ends justify the means? Does the fact that the agency uses these girls to foil potential terrorist plots which could kill innocent people make it right to use these girls as tools and weapons?

8048702,5,B0007LXOPK,"I first found this series when I was at the book store and saw the Manga. I was intrigued by the cover which showed what seemed like a[...]wielding a Dragunov SVD. I will skip the plot summery because others have described it well already. This is one of the best anime dramas I have ever seen. The characters are all distinct and the music score is great. The thing I love the best though is the voice acting in the English dub. I don't usually watch anime dubbed but the voice acting in this one is so good that I do. Also the illustrator did a great job drawing the weapons. The detail on the guns are great and anyone who plays Counter Strike would recognize some of the weapons in this series like the FN P90,the Steyer AUG , and the SIG 550. I am glad they left out any Lolita fantasies and fan service which was something I was worried about because that would have completely ruined it. I would highly recommend this series for anyone who likes anime. The only con I can find about this series is that it is too short. I also like and highly recommend this starter pack because of the awesome poster that came with it. The picture is nice and the fact that it is printed on cloth is even better because that means it will last a lot longer.",1173830400,,1248,4.2259414225941425
8048703,5,B0007LXOPK,"All of Gunslinger Girl's visuals from its DVD cover to the opening minutes of the series come off strict and complicated. As if it would take time to understand the plot, the specifics about the organization, and the characters all at the same time. I was completely wrong about this series; it has so much beauty not only within the story but in its supposed cyborg characters as well. It actually becomes a very simple series with one objective. The look in the characters eyes is so empty and the moments of happiness are limited. You come to realize the purpose of them all and that's to kill as long as they can and then die. These girls suffer traumatic lives from their parents being murdered or nobody wanting them at all.

The Welfare agency swoops in and takes care of them or so they say. After days of hospital rest their brains are implanted with a chip that alters not only their memory and mind but their physical condition as well. The chip fixes any and all problems with the body for example bad sight. The chip lowers the girl's life span and if that isn't bad enough they are also brainwashed. They're given a handler also called a brother to conditioned them in weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and table manners what you would think is the least necessary. Only some of the Fratello (siblings) take to each other like Fratello but it's easy to see that these little girls are still just little girls.

The title and gunplay only lead you to believe one thing, that this is an all out action series mainly focused on battles and what seems to be the main character Henrietta but a different and better road was taken. It looks like the main goal is to tell the stories of the girls and their Fratello, the emotional battle between the two, and shine a little light on their past and how they got there. Each episode is dedicated to a day with the girls and their brother and the mission they must complete. Gunslinger Girl is perfectly done so far, the combination of little girls that are assassins plus mixed with their human emotions is so unexpected and intriguing. You figure that the cybernetic chips would basically cut off all human ties but for some of them puberty is becoming a problem.

A few things are odd like how they can withstand being shot or stabbed but at home they have a lower tolerance for lighter pains. This has to be watched to fully grasp the images of these kids being kids and then quickly change mentally to fit the mindset of an assassin that kills with no hesitation. You figure out that all the girls really want is to be loved and accepted by their Fratello the way Jose and Henrietta do and you can see the other girls are jealous. One thing showing a bit is that Jose only looks at Henrietta as a little sister but to me it seems she sees it a little differently but I could be wrong. It's also interesting to see how crazy Henrietta reacts when Jose is in the slightest bit of harm.

The secrets of Gunslinger Girl are going to keep you wondering and excited and the story will keep you guessing about what will be the major conflict before its end. The new mystery is Angelica who has a very odd past with her parents and Elsa who hasn't even been seen yet. The animation is outstanding, there are two sets to give you a greater look at the machine gun and sniping scenes that make it look so realistic. This is a very detailed show that is right on point in every aspect and it will sometimes be hard to remember that these children are still human. It's a fantastic beginning and hopefully it will get better and end the same way it started.",1147910400,,3600,4.425339366515837
8048704,5,B0007LXOPK,"Great characters, great story, great anime, great music. The best of everything. No kiddy anime hear. A serious heart wrenching story about a secret agency that finds adolecent girls and provides care for them under the guise of the Social Welfare Agency, secretly they give the girls cybernetic bodies, and condition them to be assasins for the government. They are asigned handlers who are responsible for there conditioning and missions. They become trained assassins but they still have human emotions.

I have been a fan of Anime since the late 60's when Speed Racer came to America, and have seen just about all of it. The Gunslingergirl Series had me swept away with a gammit of emotions like no other. To bad there were only 13 episode. and the last episode is a real tear jerker.",1147910400,2,788,4.794117647058823
8048705,5,B0007LXOPK,"The cover artwork to the DVD's of Gunslinger Girl, made me roll my eyes and think that the anime industry is getting worse. They seem to have lolita fantasies, young girls with guns. In this series the girls don't look older than ten years of age. So I watched the first disc not expecting much more than silly action and weak storyline. I was glad to be proven wrong.

The opening theme song as the credits started was great and right from the getgo, the episode begins with an intro of a little blonde girl walking around, carrying a mean looking shotgun in her hand; carefully searching for something, but all we see is a room riddled with bullet holes and bloody, dead bodies laid around; Making me wonder, ""what the hell happened?"". Then a man calls some other people on the phone saying that the witness is not there. Then the scene cuts to another man and a little girl that go to another room where shady looking characters are hiding out and a blood bath starts. Then the story does a bit of a flashback that introduced the little girl named, Henrietta. She first started with the secret government agency called, The Social Welfare Agency, which is really a top secret program, that turns little girls into cybernetically enhanced, assassins!

From the very first episode to the last, Gunslinger Girl, had me hooked! It did not have much action, but when it did it was very violent and over quickly, demonstrating the girl's ability and profiency in killing the bad guys. The melee combat was kenetic and fast, the shoot-outs were bloodbaths and resulted in high body counts. Before any of that happens however, the agency's director and supervisors create a plan of attack. They discuss, strategic approaches to locations, estimated enemy count, possible risks and in case something goes wrong. They know how to cover their tracks before police gets to the scene of the crime. They try to cover all possiblities of a mission before they take action. This careful planning makes the covert element of the story more believable.

What makes the story so compelling however is not the action sequences, in fact, as I said before the action is very short and takes a backseat to the stories which unfold dramatically. The stories are mostly profiles about the little assassin girls which work in the agency; how they got picked, trained and assigned to be under their adult supervisors, known as ""handlers"". The handlers accompany the girls on these deadly missions, give orders to the girls and even join in attacking their targets. Some of the handlers are cold and uncaring to the girls- they see the girls as nothing more than tools of the trade. Other handlers act like big brothers and treat the girls like their little sisters. They grow weary of the girls safety and well being.

The little assassin girls are loyal and very obediant to their handlers; they are even willing to die to protect their handlers. Part of this loyalty comes from the conditioning (brainwashing) process and part of it comes from their emotional attachment to have a father/big brother figure. I'm glad that there was NO fan service and nothing that implied a lolita fantasy. Everything is very serious and interesting. It is this drama, complimented with the excellent script, voice acting, wonderful music, fantastic artwork which makes Gunslinger Girl, a MUST OWN anime! There is a total of 13 episodes in the whole three disc series, the Enlgish dub and extras on the dvds are excellent as well. Contains graphic violence, and mature themes, for adults only. I also recommend the anime called, Noir and Elfen Leid.",1146182400,4,3610,4.808373590982287
