NOTE: You can also order these from Jay's website if you want to but before you that please finish reading this review. First of all I will say it is a good workout that uses just basic good old-fashioned drill style cardio.  However, if given the opportunity to purchase it again I would not and here is why:

[1] There are about 12 dvds in the series and they are solely there for the purpose of jacking up the price.  Jay's series is broken down in a red, white, and blue phase.  And you begin with one phase for 3 weeks and steadily progress to the final phase in the last 3 weeks.  The set has 3 dvds that are designated for Phase 1 and the first 3 weeks.  However, there is NO difference between the workouts for weeks 1-3 and they could have put all of the exercises for each phase on 1 DVD. That would have reduced the number of DVDs from 10 to 4 (there is a bonus DVD in the set).

[2] Jay talks entirely tooooooooooooo much and it will eventually grate on your nerves as it did mine.  There is too much wasted time between exercise as this clown continously talks on and on and on.  For example, he will say that he is giving you a 15 second break between a routine, however, that 15 seconds becomes 30 or more because he cannot stop talking.  Even his wife Lin can be seen pointing at her watch to remind Jay he needs to move it along. And to be honest I have not done the entire program because I cannot deal with hearing him talk on and on and on.  I decided to switch to P90X after about 2 weeks.

[3] He should have used a professional producer in creating the dvds and the entire packaging for the series as it is confusing and just plain amateurish.  For example, he encourages you to write down how many reps of an exercise you may have done but there are no worksheets.

I am currently completing P90X and have already completed Insanity and while Jay wants to create a series which rivals those two he falls far short.  All of Beachbody workouts (TurboJam, Insanity, P90X, etc.) come with a series that actually have distinct DVDs in the series and you always get a nutrition guide, calendar, and other equipment which will get you started right away.  If you need extra equipment you will find that out by going to their website and reviewing the particular program you want to begin.  Jay's website tells you nothing (you do need a set of free weights and I recommend an exercise mat).

PROS:  It is a good cardio workout and if you finish all the exercises for each day you will get a good sweat going.  In the first three weeks at least the reps are short so you don't feel like you cannot keep up. And I do like the fact that in one day you get a total body workout (cardio and strength training which includes legs and back, shoulders and arms and abs) unlike P90X in which the workouts are segmented in which you focus on one area from day to day.

Since I already have the workouts and do not believe in wasting money I will probably do the workouts from the final phase from time to time.  However, there is no way I can deal with Jay for 9 weeks.",1286150400,3,3186,4.231404958677686
