3525961,5,B001D5C1PS,"Ok, I could have given this movie either 1 or 5 stars, I gave it 5.  Was it a cinema master piece? Well not exactly.  The move did contain gratuitous nudity, sophomoric humor,  over top gross special effects, musical numbers, plenty of politically incorrect clichs and a cameo appearance from Ron Jeremy.  Was it entertaining? Yes, my wife and I thought so.  To be honest my wife and I were sipping  Tullamore Dew over the rocks, that (arguably) may have helped this review.",1482710400,,474,4.650602409638554
3525962,2,B001D5C1PS,"I gave this film 2 stars because it does have imagination, creativity, humor, and even the bonus of politically incorrect musical numbers.  There's no question that there are some genuinely funny segments.  And if that was the extent of it, I probably would have rated it at least 3 stars.

But the crude vulgarity that is interspersed through the film turns it into garbage.  This is a niche genre that some guys find so hilarious they can't wait to share it with their buddies - a guy in our (mixed) group wants very much to show it to a friend because, as he said laughingly, ""it's the worst film every made.""  Well, I guess fine for them, but they're in a slim minority and by the way, most women will not sit through this.  The ladies with us valiantly hung in until the feces came spurting out of its, er, orifice, straight at us viewers.

So bottom line, if you get off on exceptionally gross visual humor and your tastes are still mostly adolescent, you may very well like this.  Normal adults will take a pass.",1482019200,,1019,4.440860215053763

3525987,5,B001D5C1PS,"I had to give it 5 stars because 4-3/4 was not available. Here's why I couldn't give it 5 whole stars: I am buried in an ancient Indian burial site and even though I am not indian, I know for a fact they do not reach up from the ground to grope teenagers having sex on the site. This absurdity is wholly unrealistic. Really all we do is lay and wait in our boxes (or coffins, depending on time of death) and tell each other buffalo hunting stories and mentally make arrowheads for out next big hunt. One thing I would like to clear up is the fact that it does not take 5 minutes to change a normal girl into a lesbian. I would think it takes longer than that unless you were already pre-wired in that direction.
My cat (MAYHEM) now refuses to eat chicken flavored mushy food for some reason. I guess I will change his food to CAT flavored and see if he notices. He is already pissed for making him watch this movie, but then again he does NOT have a sense of humor. Other than the burial thing, I liked the movie because the makers made an extreme effort to overdo the unreality of the movie. I expected it to be stupid-retarded but it was just grossly humorous for those who have that kind of sick humor, such as myself. It was funny if you don't have a good grip on reality. OK, my schizophrenia just kicked in, gotta go eat. I think I'll have me some feather soup. Caz I just don't like the meat.

My reaction was the same as Arbies. Denny!!!!! I ain't cleaning this up. Haha frekin classic. A satire on fast food and war, where can that go wrong. This movie has a little bit of everything your sure to be offended by something. I usually never get offended but this one did it for sure. If you love zombies and hat chickens this is your bucket.

3526011,2,B001D5C1PS,"Channel surfing one night, I came upon this. I thought it was a movie. I suppose it could be classified as such. Having seen ""The Toxic Avenger"" years ago, I suppose I should have known better. Nope. The movie starts off harmlessly enough, two horny teenagers getting it on in some graveyard at night. You could change the channel and save your eyeballs from what is about to happen. Or you sit there in a Thanksgiving-induced stupor and watch as decomposed hands join in the fun. This movie seems created for the sole purpose of abandoning anything that is decent and pure. IF you're easily offended, might i suggest viewing something a little more wholesome? While that goes without saying, the zombie hands and fingers proceed to anally ravish the boy, the girl gets up after some local yokel interrupts them while playing with his sausage. After they leave, the zombie hands eviscerate the hillbilly orally. Okay.

After that, the movie descends into utter madness. Every ethnic group is skewered in some way, shape, or form. Not to mention corpulent individuals who can't hold their chicken. There's a bathroom scene that will make you never want to use the toilet again. I suppose the filmmakers wanted to create a savage satire of our consumerist society and the fast food industry. You could take it as such. But be warned, this is just a gross-fest that borders on the insane and demented. There's gratuitous nudity, a nude zombie chicken murdering orgy in which customers are impaled, eaten, raped, and in one disturbing scene, some guy's spine is ripped out while he's still moving.

I suppose the movie went over budget on the fake blood and green goo that pours out of the zombie chicken beaks and anyone unfortunate enough to ingest the pitiful excuse for chicken. There's some dude going around with a terrible southern accent and doesn't care enough about his customers to prevent the pissed off Native American possessed chickens from slaughtering EVERYONE! I didn't laugh when it's realized that alcohol can stop the carnage. The drunk Indian in the parking lot was a little too much. The actors ( or lack of them), the singing (plenty of ear-splitting, off-key nonsense), the lesbian tongue hockey, ejaculating into food, mop handles being shoved into rectums to emerge as a new and improved procreation device, green exploding goo, toilet explosions, gruesome ways to be offed by feathered extras who had nothing better else to do, is an LSD-induced trip through hell.

There's a few moments where you find yourself chuckling just because you're in awe of the director's audacity. I mean 9/11 jokes people! Involving the only Muslim in the restaurant who takes it upon herself to save the world via suicide bomb. The movie is everywhere and anywhere. It seems the director wanted to shock EVERYBODY! Yep. He did that.

I changed the channel every now and then. I continued to watch just because I wanted to see how far the movie would go. It went there and then some. I guess it was meant to be a savage commentary on our fast food industry and the ridiculous political correctness of liberal zealots we find ourselves enslaved by today.

Only watch if you really like the genre and don't mind vile, stomach churning, bad acting, toilet gross-out humor, ethnically offensive satire.

Two stars because it takes guts to write something like this bad, pitch it, get funding, and get people to actually give up their dignity to be a part of something this foul.",1417132800,,3478,4.846801346801347

3526030,3,B001D5C1PS,"Ok,... First of all, you have to look at the very 1st review by chris blackshere, its very straight forward and pretty much sums up everything. Just the title alone should tell you what the movie is about....

It's completely gross...cheesy....sick...outrageous...non sense...absurd.....bizarre.....but yet still funny and sexy in a very weird way. It was my first horror musical and i have to tell you i wasn't expecting that at all. One of my friend said i would probably like it despite all the songs and stuff so he got it for me. But now that i think about it, I think it was just to see my reaction the next day....

To be honest here i'll have to admit that i did watched the whole thing the 1st time because it was so strange and absurd that i needed to see what was next. I soon discovered that the actors weren't that bad and that i needed to see it all as a ""horror fan"" point of view just to know exactly what it was about....And then came the first song......OMG.........i don't even know what to say..................disturbing i guess......but captivating...lol.  At this point, i was in for  the strangest ride i have ever been on as a horror fan watching a ""so called"" horror/musical movie (does that even exist..?). There was some extremely gross moments, but there was also some good ""cheesy plot"" elements that got me wondering what would be next....so....i stayed for the whole ride...please don't get me wrong here, i have respect for this film and everyone that was involved in making it. It was daring, fun and very sexy but it is NOT for everyone!!...As for me, i decided i would definitely be checking more of those ""troma"" movies.

I went back to it a couple times (yes...im that crazy..ha!) mostly to show it to other friends and i realised that Yes, the movie is cheesy but all the work and the effort they put in to make it was not. I also payed more attention to the songs and also realised that they were actually very well written and performed. Some of them were also very good, a few songs sounded a bit too poppy for me but some other songs were very good. kinda Scottish/Irish folk with very catchy melodies.

You know all those haunted house movie background? , and how they were built on some old burial grounds and cemeteries?  That's pretty much what we have here, except that its a fast food chicken joint instead of a house. I know it sounds ridiculous but that's exactly what the movie is about.

If you're not afraid of absurd and cheesy flicks, if you're able to laugh at gross and disgusting stuff, if you enjoyed musical and horror movies (huh?), if you have only a few months left to live or just escaped from a mental facility then you might wanna consider trying this movie. The following may be required: a beer, a block of cheese, a barrel of KFC, a puke bucket and a gun (last resort).....

After seeing that, which I suggest viewers see before seeing the film, I can understand why the target audience is 10 to 14 year old males given that the adults actors were, for the most part, regressing to or never egressed from that period in life. Yes, we all know it's all a very low budget spoof of the sex/horror stuff that's been around for decades. But, whether it's high or low budget the ""for money & status"" task of simply redoing without creativity or imagination is just plain boring.

Acting? Never was a consideration unless you count one or two, brought in for 10 seconds or so, cameo spots.

Well you could probably say its about a fried chicken restaurant built on an ancient American Indian burial ground that causes poultry to come back to life and tear up the joint!

If you are unfamiliar with Troma's over the top acting style and weird to gross sense of humor, then you might find yourself either killing yourself laughing at this movie, or shocked and appalled at how over the top it is... although there has been a few born again Christian prudes who have given the movie 1 star because they mistook this movie for Debbie Does Dallas... but trust me, the acting in this movie is at least 1.5 times better!

I think this has become my second favorite movie Troma has ever done, just behind the 4 Toxic Avenger series, if you consider those 4 movies to be the one, but if not then well this movie becomes my 3rd favorite, no wait, 2nd, no 4th, wait, 5th or 4th, maybe 3rd, I dunno... and you're thinking to yourself ""who cares"" and thats what I think of people who say Troma is elephants waste on steroids, or is that me who said that?

I give this movie the thumbs up, but I could not give much more else up, because the nudity was played by chicks that where way too skinny for my taste, but I think Llyod cast them to look like human chickens anyway, but there was a girl later on in the nude that looked better, so that made up for the skinnier chicks, I think, wait, did it?

3526036,2,B001D5C1PS,"""Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead"" is an unusual film even by Troma's standards. Shot with amateur actors in a church and an abandoned McDonald's in Buffalo, New York on a very slim budget, the film recounts fast food capitalism run amok with terrifying consequences. The film starts with the typical Lloyd Kaufman introduction (the best one he's ever done, incidentally) and quickly shifts to the ""Tromahawk Tribe Indian Burial Ground,"" which is defiled by a couple of teenagers, Wendy (Kate Graham) and Arbie (Jason Yachmanin,) before being vastly more defiled by American Chicken Bunker, which builds a fast food restaurant atop it.

Did I mention that ""Poultrygeist"" is also a profane musical? The music and choreography is about what you'd expect with occasionally witty lyrics, but generally resorting to shock humor to get laughs. The restaurant has a crew of oddballs working there, from a jihadist fry cook named Hummus (Rose Grauami) to a gay Mexican named Paco Bell (Khalid Rivera.) Management is provided by Denny (Joshua Olatunde) and General Lee Roy (Robin L. Watkins.) I have to admit I was amused by the fast food names the cast sported, but was less amused by most other aspects of the film. It's obvious to anyone who has ever seen a Troma film before (or anyone who read the film's title carefully) that the ghosts of Indian chickens come back to haunt the American Chicken Bunker, and it starts on opening day. Manager Denny has his hands full with college protestors outside and an exponentially worsening mutant chicken problem inside (""Who put these mysterious, vein-covered, pulsating eggs in this box?"")

Sounding the alarm about the forthcoming chicken apocalypse is Ron Jeremy (as ""Crazy Ron"") who, despite his misgivings, still orders a value meal. Shortly thereafter the film unveils the most inappropriate and gratuitous use of salad tongs in film history, followed by a customer (Jared) eating flavor pod-enhanced chicken and making a typically (for Troma) disgusting trip to the bathroom in a scene that goes on far too long. One thing you can say for ""Poultrygeist"" (and Troma in general) is that political correctness is not given a second thought, and that's a good thing on balance.

After the bathroom cleaning gets under way, you might think the movie can't get worse, but that's where you would be wrong. Lloyd Kaufman enters as Colonel Kluck in a hilarious looking chicken suit, and before long disrobes, reveals himself to be Old Arbie, and the two Arbies do a disturbing song and dance number that unfortunately culminates in Lloyd showing that he's wearing a thong. Thank you movie: I hadn't had a good nightmare in a while. Paco goes through a particularly nasty transformation into a ""Sloppy Jose,"" a shredded BBQ sandwich (with olives for eyes, and which can talk,) which The General promptly eats. Not only is there a fairly unpleasant romance subplot involving Arbie and Wendy, but there's an even more odious romance subplot involving a character named Carl Jr. (Caleb Emerson) and some raw poultry, and that's all I'm going to say about it other than mentioning that the broad-brushed humor in ""Poultrygeist"" makes ""Bio-Dome"" with Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin appear subtly nuanced and stately by comparison. Just because something's ridiculous doesn't make it funny.

Needless to say this film has lots of vomiting, bleeding, oozing, and other distasteful bits, all very repetitive and derivative. Kaufman wanted this to be the bloodiest movie in history according to the extras, and all the gross-out scenes go on far too long, the net effect of which is that the movie revolves around the lame gore rather than the storyline. Increasing numbers of people are infected with the chicken, The General battles a mutant green death chicken, and is himself subsumed by the avian nightmare, as is Carl Jr., who has a new and unsavory use for a mop handle as it turns out. Just because something's gross doesn't make it shocking (or funny.)

The chicken apocalypse and zombification scenes are way (way) too long, and in possible the most politically incorrect moment in the film, the heroes figure out that the one thing that can kill the mutant chickens is alcohol as they are, after all, Native American chickens. (I don't value politically correctness, but that is so not funny on so many levels.) Thankfully there's a keg of beer handy, and Arbie and Wendy pump away to ultimately defeat the horde. (Sample dialogue: ""At least with a demon chicken you know where you stand."") Just because something's politically incorrect doesn't make it shocking (or funny.) Interestingly, in the commentary Lloyd Kaufman noted that he was concerned about public opinion, but that no Native American groups complained about the film, which is something he was (justifiably) worried about. It makes me wonder how many of them saw it.

The set has oodles of extras, including a 90-minute ""making of"" feature called ""Poultry in Motion,"" which is far more interesting and entertaining than the film itself, and is the principal reason I gave the DVD two stars versus one. The travails of low-budget filmmaking have never been more clear. There was no real money for actors, so Kaufman cast amateur fans who wanted to be in the movie. It's pretty clear that these are mostly amateurs, but Kaufman annoyed me with nonstop complaining about the actors in the documentary. So let me get this right: you don't pay them, they move to Buffalo to work and live in (!) a derelict McDonald's and church basement (the two shooting locations) during the summer, and you're complaining? Then to top it off, the temperature gets up to 105 Fahrenheit and you refuse to get into the hot Colonel Kluck costume, letting an unpaid assistant do it instead? That's some leadership style.

Despite all these obstacles, the film opened in New York and played in 300 theaters around the country, becoming the most critically-acclaimed Troma release ever. I don't share that enthusiasm, but truly enjoyed ""Poultry in Motion"" and the many other extras in the package (e.g. footage of the premiere, shots of recording the songs, making the monsters, deleted scenes, etc.) The deleted scenes include Ron Jeremy's happy ending monologue (which is very long; he memorized it in ten minutes,) which I think would have made a better concluding shot to the film that what actually made the cut.

""Poultrygeist"" sounded like a brilliant concept for a low-budget picture, and certainly had promise. There are a few parts that are genuinely clever (like the advertisement that reads ""Semper Thigh"") but the film is far too long for the comedy material they have, and the zombie chicken material is too weak and repetitive to successfully pad the running time without becoming monotonous. While I had hoped that ""Poultrygeist"" would soar, in the end it's for the birds.",1281225600,4,6873,5.0069991251093615

This movie is funny but not for all audiences, unless you enjoy gore combined with more gore. But, it's Lloyd Kaufman, what else to say?

The movie itself just was not funny and I know if I had seen this about ten years ago I would be cracking up and showing everybody this film.  The movie has the type of comedy that if as writing the script the individual said ""what kind of generic, cliched horror jokes should I use"" and the whole comedy point to the film is predictable.

3526059,3,B001D5C1PS,"Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead (Lloyd Kaufman, 2006)

I'm not a big Troma fan. In fact, the last Troma film I remember actually liking was the original The Toxic Avenger. It's gotten to the point where even the Troma name on a movie will cause me to avoid it (even if they're just distributing--I've seen my share of Troma-distributed flicks, and to a one, they're hideous). But the concept behind Poultrygeist was just too plain old stupid for me to pass up, and I have to say, now that I've watched it, I can't remember the last time I was this surprised by a movie. I can't honestly say that I enjoyed it, but it's certainly the funniest movie I've seen this week.

We open with Arbie and Wendy (are you getting the joke yet?), a typical high school couple, making out in the local Indian burial ground, and Wendy promising that going off to college won't change her feelings for Arbie. Yeah, right. Fast-forward a semester, and Arbie has gone back to relive some memories, only to find that the burial ground has been bulldozed to make way for an American Chicken Bunker, a mega-fast-food-mart. It's on the verge of opening, but is under protest by a number of fringe groups, one of which happens to contain Wendy--who, much to Arbie's musical dismay, has become a lesbian and a vegan. To spite her, he decides to get a job at ACB, where he joins co-workers Denny, Paco Bell, Carl Jr. (okay, are you getting the joke now?), and Hummus. Problem is, interpersonal drama is not the only thing going on here, for those Indian spirits aren't too happy about being bulldozed, and have every intention of getting their revenge by possessing everything in sight. From there, the movie becomes a massive gorefest, but in such an over-the-top way that it seems even less like a gore film than, say, Dead Alive does. It's all just stupid fun. (And has a Ron Jeremy cameo!)

The pop culture references come thick and fast in this one, and there's very little that doesn't get skewered here. As well, if you have any aspirations to political correctness at all, you'll probably want to avoid this flick, which takes potshots at every race, creed, color, sexual preference, body type, etc. No matter who you are, there's something in this movie that's liable to offend you. If you like this sort of thing, however, it's great. I've seen more than one review that calls it Troma's best film ever; I'm inclined to agree. ***",1228521600,20,2421,4.625581395348838
3526060,4,B001D5C1PS,"Yup, that Lloyd Kaufman is at it again.  And like most of the recent Troma films, Kaufman is upping the ante on what gross out, bad taste, low brow shenanigans he can put on screen and get away with.
Poultrygeist is about a corporate fast food chicken joint that sets up camp right on top of an ancient Native American burial ground.  This makes for some nasty, veiny, green oozing eggs that infect folks and give them a serious case of The Trots.  Not only that but the green infected chicken also turns folks into chicken beaked zombies.  Arby is a dorky college student on his first day of the job when all of this goes down.  He must rekindle his relationship with his girlfriend(who turned lesbian on him while he was away), provide great customer service and deal with the chicken zombies and ultimately save the day.
It's typical Troma fare, though a bit more ambitious in the gross out department.  Low grade FX are common for Troma, and while they're still cheap and schlocky here, they're probably some of the best we've seen in a Troma film.  It looks like a lot of time was spent on them.  The latter half of the film, where the chicken zombies run amok, pulls out all the stops.  Kaufman's really going for the throat here.  It almost seems as though he were trying to compete with Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, but Jackson's film is nearly impossible to top in sheer quantity of gore, blood and prosthetics.  Being Troma, a lot more sexual violence is thrown in such as a guy getting his testicles tore off and thrown into the deep fryer, or a man growing breasts which burst open to reveal baby chicken heads.  Of course the childish sex humor is in full swing too.  We instinctively know that being a Troma film about fast food that some bodily fluids will end up in the food preparation....and they do!  One character has sex with a partially thawed chicken(a hillbilly of course), a few lesbian and bizarre fetish scenes are thrown in as well.  No minority group is safe from ribbing either.
I did like the film.  I'm not a hardcore Troma fan though I've seen most of their films.  For me, the mood has to be right in order for me to enjoy them.  I feel that sometimes they just try way too hard to be zany and silly and some of the films tend to run out of steam really fast.  This film was kinda fun though.  It was gory and off the wall enough to be fascinating.  My only real complaint was the leading man, who I feel is one of the most annoying and unlikable ""heroes"" I've ever seen in a movie, Troma or otherwise.  It's sad to see a fast food employee that's actually more annoying than Spongebob Squarepants.
Yes, it's tasteless and disgusting and will have the average moviegoer running for the door(I can't imagine how my wife is gonna respond!  He he he.).  Troma fans simply can't go wrong.  Cult and horror fans might be split down the middle coz even fans of those genres can feel that Troma is just a bit too goofy.  But whether you like it or not, I don't think anyone will be able to say it wasn't unique.",1228521600,,3037,4.388193202146691

3526064,5,B001D5C1PS,"In Tromaville, there was once a sacred Indian burial ground which was part of the town's history as a year later a military themed fast food KFC-like fast food franchise called ""American Chicken Bunker"" was built over it. A nerdy High School graduate named Arby now works there now that his girlfriend has turned all Lesbian (Or is it Bi?) with some Lesbian protester who wants to have the place shut down. But unfortunately evil spirits begin to take over the food as they turn whoever eats it into vicious killer Chicken-esque zombies or killer fanged Chicken demons as it turns into a blood night of hell.

Entertaining, funny as hell and gory horror musical comedy spoof from Troma has made their greatest masterpiece yet since ""The Toxic Avenger"". Director and Troma creator Lloyd Kaufman with producer Michael Herz has conjured up a diabolically fun and gruesome flick that uses social satire on the fast food industry, eroticism, lesbianism, vomit, laughs, toliet humor, catchy music, an appearence by the legendary Ron Jeremy, and extreme cartoonish gore and violence abound that will churn your stomach. I saw this last year in theaters at Tromadance and it blew me away, it's an instant cult classic that is a must see but not for the squeamish.

This 3-Disc limited edition has terrific extras like audio commentary, Theatrical trailer to this and other Troma films, Alternate happy ending, Promos, music videos, easter eggs, deleted scenes, feature length documentary, featurettes, and Kara-yolke Karaoke singalong disc. This is one of the most politically incorrect, funniest and bloodiest films i've ever seen but it may offend some people but fans of gore, horror comedies and Troma should see this one.

3526065,5,B001D5C1PS,This is the finest directed movie I have ever seen. It hearkens back to the styles of Jules White and John Ford. It seems modern directors have forgotten that directing is an art and not a job. Rarely do you see a director take their craft so seriously. The whole production has a classic Hollywood vide to it. This is a must see for film students and film scholars alike. Lloyd Kaufman has really out done himself with this one. His best work to date.,1226361600,3,452,4.329411764705882

3526067,4,B001D5C1PS,"If only Troma was able to crank these gems out faster!
I was lucky enough to be in a test audience for this movie several years ago.  It was unfinished but still very entertaining!  Troma was 20 years ahead of its time in the 80's, where now the level of comical gore and perversion of those previous 80's films is now commonplace.  Poultrygeist is here to raise the bar up several notches!  I cannot wait to see the final cut!  I remember seeing and hearing things so outrageous I found myself in some weird moral grey area of feeling guilty that I was laughing.  I don't want to go into detail spoiling anything, but you will experience things you've never seen before or could imagine.  If you don't like politically incorrect comedy with perverted message of demented hope...avoid this movie!  If you've just experienced some harsh reality and would like to escape reality into a world of the ridiculous chicken zombie, then this is the movie for you.  This movie is not only for the die-hard Troma fan, but also for anyone who enjoys crude humor that can be found on Adult Swim, Comedy Central, or ""the Internets""  Prepare to have your mind blown.  That's right,...""blown""!

UPDATE: After watching the final cut on DVD, I have to subtract 1 star.  I was appalled to find out that Lloyd censored the toliet gag.  The commentary revealed that his wife, a financier, demanded the effect to be censored.  Having remembered the uncensored effect from the rough cut of the movie, I became strangely upset.  I wonder if the Blu Ray has added it back?  I don't know.",1225584000,3,1563,4.625454545454545
3526068,5,B001D5C1PS,"Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead is Lloyd Kaufman's best movie
to date. Which is true for almost all of his previous movies as the
legend only gets better and better. This film can be read on so many
levels that finally being able to revisit it over and over again now
that it is out on DVD is something many fans have been waiting for. Of
course the careless viewer can watch it as a wonderful splattering gory
and amazingly entertaining, wildly funny horror musical with a great
story and one of the best casts Troma has ever had the pleasure of
working with, and even then you are in for a treat because no
nanosecond is wasted. There is so much going on in the background, the
tiniest props have the most insightful jokes and messages on them.
Check what is on the headstones in the opening scenes, read the titles
on DVD covers appearing in the film, T-shirts people are wearing -
there are many opportunities to freeze-frame your DVD and see what is
easily missed when you saw the film in a theater. Every detail has been
given much care, down to the names of all the characters. But there are
also load of political statements, that can be read painfully wrong if
you are not aware of the background of the director, and are all the
more powerful if you are. Other than that, it is one of those rare
zombie-themed films that are provokingly intelligent. There are so many
zombies in hundreds of movies that are there only for gores sake, here
they serve a purpose, here they present a striking metaphor of what
modern society has come to, filled with unthinking trend-following
food-stuffing individuals who seem to have no control over themselves
and much less a mind of their own. Most striking is the idea the movie
is built upon: a fast food restaurant built on a sacred native American
burial ground magnificently represents how the new Americans have
treated the land they took and the original cultures that lived on it:
destroyed it, killed it, buried it and built a literally and
metaphorically totally tasteless new meaningless culture on top of it.

The dialog is fast, witty and powerful and the film leaves the viewer
with a whole lot to chew upon This again is a movie that demonstrates
how ridiculous the popular notion is that Troma makes trivial and
tasteless movies. Lloyd Kaufman may make movies the about tastelessness
of todays world, but that doesn't make his movies tasteless. Quite the
contrary - there are very few directors in the movie industry who are
able to show what is wrong with humanity in such a painfully accurate
way,

The 3-disc DVD set is not to be missed by anyone who is remotely
interested in horror, Troma, movies in general and fans of Lloyd
Kaufman's work. It is a total encyclopedia on what is Poultrygeist with
not only a beautifully presented widescreen version of the film, but
loads of insightful extra's on all three discs. There is a feature
length documentary on the making of the film, shots of the NYC
premiere, deleted scenes, film-making lessons, an alternate ending,
music video's, karaoke versions of the songs from the film and many
more Tromatic goodies.

A great film by a legendary genius director with a very talented cast.
And all that in this kind of loaded package for such a price. Get it,
before they're gone. It's the best buy for your money.",1225497600,5,3326,4.633898305084746

Watch for one of the greatest gore segements in the history of horror in this film. When people start turning into chicken zombies, its non-stop gore. Its one of the greatest scenes ive ever witnessed. Way over the top and just awesome.

Classic Kaufman.

Here's the plot if you need one--
A fast food chicken joint is constructed on an Native American burial ground.  I guess, although I'm not really positive, that these native's spirits possessed the dead chickens and arose from the grave, seeking double revenge.  Chicken zombies from hell!!!  Bwaaaaahahahaa.....

Poultrygeist has the basic Troma stuff:
-more gratuitous nudity than a porno (almost)
-revolting projectile vomiting
-extremely disgusting turd spraying
-absurdily bloody decapitations
-outrageous satirical episodes slamming pop culture
-macaroni and cheesy acting
-excessive damage to the crotchal region
-ignoramus heroes that you gotta love
-tactless social commentary
-insane gore stuffed down your throat

Not since Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" has poultry embedded such fear in the human race.

They are hands down the best and nastiest in Troma's existence. Now, for those that don't know, the film has some musical numbers here and there, but wouldn't be classified as a musical (see Takashi Miike's film ""The Happiness of the Katakuris"" as a prime example of this), and even those are great!
