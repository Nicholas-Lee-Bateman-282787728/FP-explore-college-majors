8158323,5,B000KN8QB2,We love the Move 'N Groove series!!  My daughter is 4 and I keep a 4 & 2 year old.  They all love to exercise and always want to do it again as soon as it finishes!!,1390003200,,165,3.4324324324324325
8158324,5,B000KN8QB2,"My two-year-old loves the Move 'N Groove Kids series. She likes all three videos, but her favorite is the original, followed by the Zoo video, followed by this one.

The graphics are done nicely, the kids are actively (and positively) involved in the dances/movements. It's not annoying to hear in the background like some videos, and you can feel good that even though your child is watching TV, he/she is also moving around and getting exercise.

I used to be a dancer and dance educator, so I can say that what kids learn from the Move 'N Groove Kids videos is similar to what would be covered in a creative-movement or creative-dance class for pre-schoolers and younger elementary students. Deb knows what she's doing and the kids are learning much more from the movements than you would immediately assume.

One thing I prefer about the original Move 'N Groove Kids video is that it was presented like an actual class. You could see the teachers demonstrating to the students, and see the students responding to the teacher. It was like being in the class yourself. The MNGK Go to the Park and Go to the Zoo videos do not show the instructor demonstrating the majority of the time. The full focus is on the kids, and it feels less like a class. While I can see some benefits to that, I really liked that my two-year-old was (unbeknownst to her) learning how to function in a class environment while she was dancing along with the original video. This is an awesome bonus! I do miss this in the second two MNGK videos, even though they are still very well done and full of fun and education.

I highly recommend any of the videos in the Move 'N Groove Kids series, and this one is no exception!",1387065600,,1698,4.53921568627451
8158325,5,B000KN8QB2,"Wow! I have had a home daycare for 26 years, and I have never had a DVD that gets kids moving like this one! Even small children can do it and keep up. The giggles are the best part. It has a warm up to start and a cool down that is relaxing and soothing. I highly recommend this for ages 1-10",1385769600,2,293,3.7419354838709675
8158326,5,B000KN8QB2,"We bought this DVD after my 4 year old daughter consistently liked doing the Move N Groove Kids go to the Zoo.  She likes this DVD just as well.  It's very creative and has fun, easy movements for kids.  This one does require a partner for part of it so I have joined in at times.  But fortunately, she will also use a stuffed animal as her partner, as I am usually trying to cook dinner while she is doing it.

My daugher really likes the freeze dance portion.  We're glad to have this DVD during winter to keep active.",1353196800,,520,4.15
