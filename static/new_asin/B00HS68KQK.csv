8635365,3,B00HS68KQK,"I had taken tap lessons quite a few years ago and was hoping to find some of the same instructions I received back then so I could start tapping again.  I was taught warmup tap exercises, the Soft Shoe, the Grapevine, the Waltz Time Step, the Jack Stanley, etc.  I was hoping to find some of these to use as a refresher.  The Soft Shoe was a pretty basic dance step that you could easily apply to music.  It would have helped if the camera had zoomed in on his feet so you could actually see up close the ball change and flaps.  This video fell short of my expectations.",1417478400,3,570,4.1454545454545455
