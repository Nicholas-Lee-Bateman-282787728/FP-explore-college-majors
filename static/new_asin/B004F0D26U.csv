8427693,5,B004F0D26U,"I hesitated before paying abut $200 for a set of documentary films about Irish craft made by a team of film makers I had not heard of before. However, my deep interest in traditional craft, expecially woodworking and textile arts, compelled me to take a chance. I am very glad I did.

This set of nearly 40 documentary films, about 20 hours of viewing in all, is a treasure that preserves the words, works, and methods of masters of their craft -- many of whom have now passed to their reward and might otherwise be forgotten.

We are lucky that the film-makers did such excellent work (the sound, picture, editing, and narration are excellent) and that they have gathered these films into a single volume of 14 DVDs and offer them at a reasonable price. I expect these films will be studied and enjoyed by crafts people and scholars for a very, very long time to come.",1348099200,7,869,4.528662420382165
8427694,5,B004F0D26U,"The Hands DVD set contains 37 films documenting Irish crafts, recorded mostly in the late 1970s and in the 1980s.  The filmmakers' intention was to create historical records of Irish crafts, and of the lifestyle of the craftspeople, at a time when Irish society was moving towards a modernization that seemed to threaten the continued practice of making crafts in the traditional ways. This goal of documentation has been very successfully achieved!

The Hands series provides stunning photography, creative and effective video composition, educational and interesting narration for each segment. And Irish music plays in the background of many of the scenes. Each segment was very well done.

A feature that I especially appreciate in these films is that the photographer showed all of the various steps in the creation of each of the hand-crafted items.  He moved his camera in close to focus upon the craftpersons' hands at work, the details of the machines' actions and details of the finished pieces. The narrators explained each step of the process.  I am learning a lot about how things are made.

Another aspect that makes this series outstanding is that the Hands producers documented the lifestyles of many of the craftspeople.  The films show the tranquil countryside where they lived and worked, providing many images of beautiful Irish scenery.  In some of the segments, we can also see small Irish towns, farm animals, the exteriors and interiors of the craftspeoples' homes, their family members, how they prepared meals, etc., in addition to how they performed their craft work.

I am really enjoying viewing these DVDs. I highly recommend the Hands series to anyone interested in traditional Irish crafts, Irish history and traditional Irish lifestyle.",1333843200,5,1769,5.222614840989399
8427695,5,B004F0D26U,"I received this fascinating and unique collection of films as a gift. It's perfect for anyone interested in Ireland, Irish crafts, or craftsmanship in general. I sat in a room full of children and adults to watch these, and you could hear a pin drop--everyone was riveted to the screen. As the title suggests, the films are about a lifetime's worth of skill and craftsmanship, using little more than simple tools and hands. There was a wonderful rhythm to the each program, and each captured the beauty and intricacy of the crafts, and also the way of life of the crafts people.

This would make a one-of-a-kind gift.",1291680000,8,617,4.712962962962963
