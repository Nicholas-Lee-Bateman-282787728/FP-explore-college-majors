8596257,4,B00DQBPVCM,"This ""Drive-In Collection"" double feature DVD is a real gem for lovers of camp or 1970s Filipino action films. Both of these films were made in the Philippines by director Cirio H. Santiago in 1978, but the similarity stops there.

""Death Force"" is an unexpectedly good action film starring James Iglehart as Doug Russell, a soldier finishing up his tour in Vietnam who falls in with the wrong crowd. Doug and two of his fellow soldiers agree to get involved in drug smuggling for a quick payday. While Doug has a beautiful wife and kid back in the States and is (other than the drug deal) a generally standup guy, the other two are trouble. After the deal goes down they stab Doug and throw him off a boat leaving him for dead. It will not surprise you to learn that Doug is not dead, and alights on an island inhabited solely by two Japanese soldiers still fighting World War Two. The Japanese nurse him back to health, but there's definite tension between the parties.

Back home, one of the murderers tells Doug's wife that Doug is not coming home, and tries in vain to put the moves on her. This will be a grave error. Doug and the Japanese bond and they teach him the ways of the samurai. The now ex-soldiers consolidate their power as drug lords brutally, while Doug is getting schooled in the art of Asian fighting (""You never win battles in anger."") There are certain flaws in the proto-mobster's business plan (they take checks?), not to mention the worst Brando impression ever and a ridiculous steam room assassination that will make you roll your eyes, but the Japanese hold a ceremony appointing Doug as a samurai and rescue from the island comes quickly.

As soon as Doug gets back to the US, he starts systematically dismantling the evil drug operation with his newfound samurai skills and sword. It's actually far more entertaining than I imagined it would be (though it's far from believable). The two bad guys who stabbed Doug on the boat, Morelli (Carmen Argenziano) and McGee (Leon Isaac) hire a hit man to get Doug, while McGee just isn't bright enough to leave Doug's wife and kid alone. I won't spoil the action, but I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed both the barbershop scuffle and the gift McGee gets in the hospital. McGee shortly departs for his palace in Mexico with Doug's wife and kid along for the ride as hostages. This does not seem like a smart move at the time, and it turns out it isn't. I won't tell you what happens, but despite some low budget special effects, McGee's fate is pretty great. Interestingly this film actually does have a completely unanticipated twist ending that genuinely startled me. For a ridiculous B-movie, ""Death Force"" is surprisingly entertaining.

I must admit I bought this to see John Carradine in a film called ""Vampire Hookers"". It was everything I imagined it would be. It's another Filipino movie from Cirio H. Santiago, and opens in grand fashion with a monologue from John Carradine in a white tux with a red bow tie. Carradine is Richmond Reed, an old vampire commanding a bevy of voluptuous girls to do his bidding in his relentless search for blood. The action starts with two unlikeable sailors on shore leave in the Philippines. In the first five minutes they learn important life lessons about eating duck embryos and transvestism. (Don't ask.) The sailors and a seemingly helpful cab driver named Julio (Leo Martinez) get caught up in a plot in a cemetery with two hookers, but they get saved by their chief. Carradine is the chief vampire of course and he immediately begins pompously paraphrasing Shakespeare (""It is time for you to shuffle off your mortal coil!"") He basically speaks only in poetry, and that's pretty funny especially with a script that's awful even by John Carradine standards.

Obviously Reed and his vampirettes sleep in coffins along with wannabe vampire Pavo (Vic Diaz) who makes flatus in a coffin into high art. The film has some hilarious dialogue (""It's not murder, it's dinner!"") and also a scene with John Carradine hunting a rat with a crossbow. (Ugh.) The film ends with the dignity of ""The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman with Pavo, the gassy comic relief vampire going mental and leading to a cave in that I don't understand the physics of. The closing song croons ""Don't get hooked on a hooker"" and is the perfect hilariously bad close to this mess. ""Vampire Hookers"" has a great title, but is far from a great film. Lovers of more pungent cinematic cheese, though, will find much to appreciate here.",1511568000,2,4516,4.70417193426043

8596261,5,B00DQBPVCM,Vampire Hookers is hilarious just from Vic Diaz as the assistant to the undead John Carradine. He really does know how to brighten up any movie shot in Manilla. Death Force is an unsung thriller from the era of Blaction. Vic Diaz plays a drug lord this time.,1380758400,7,258,4.395833333333333
