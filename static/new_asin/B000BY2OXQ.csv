About midway through the film he muses to his journal that he ""would like to write something as essential as a glass of wine in the evening.""

Wrong Move is not as visually interesting as the first film in the road trilogy, Alice in the Cities, which tells the story of a journalist who loses interest in his assignment and begins visually documenting America's hotels and restaurants in the first half of the film (Wenders has a remarkable eye for Americana), then spends the second half of the film back in Europe trying to help a young girl find her way home.

Both Alice in the Cities and Wrong Move feature the same lead actor, and both track a wanderer who has no apparent direction. Alice in the Cities is lighter and features far more humor while Wrong Move is much more brooding and features a growing band of discontents (that includes a young Nastassia Kinski and Hannah Schygulla) who wander through Germany and end up at the manor of yet another discontent (a capitalist who feels guilty about it). Alice in the Cities is probably the more acessible work. Wrong Move both visually and thematically begs comparison with Fassbinder's work of the same period. I've yet to see the third installment in the road trilogy, Kings of the Road (as far as I know this one is still unavailable in any format to American audiences).

My all-time favorite Wenders film is State of Things (which as far as I know is still only available to American audiences on VHS). State of Things (along with Fassbinder's Beware of the Holy Whore) are, in my view, the two most interesting films about filmmaking that I know of.

The sequel to State of Things called Lisbon Story (unlike its far superior predecessor) is available on DVD in America.",1343174400,6,2020,4.618384401114207

If you would have born in the middle of the ashes of the defeated Germany, after WW2, perhaps would not you be pursued for the weight of the historical facts? So it' s reasonable to suppose to make a profound process of depuration and self questioning in all orders.

This movie is true attempt to state and face psychological and sociological inquiries about it. A ramble through Germany with various companions will allow this simple man to make a true fascinating brainstorming in a very somber walk movie.

The script of Peter Handke and the visible echoes of Goethe Wilhelm Meister will obligate you to pay special attention for this ambitious and original work

This is the second chapter of the Trilogy, completed for Alice in the cities and finished by Kings of the road.

The golden cast is splendid. Hanna Schygulla,  Natasha Kinski, Ivan Desny and Rudiger Vogler.",1139961600,3,1080,4.779569892473118
