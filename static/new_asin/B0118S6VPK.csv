7329786,1,B0118S6VPK,Purchased due to 4 star overall review. In short the movie was a disappointment. Simple plot with a few ordinary mercenaries  who really don't have a plan on how they could capture a target while fending off the ENTIRE  Chinese military. Action scenes not very interesting either - last fight scene was good but  didn't last long. Also could not ignore the cheesy military propaganda no matter how hard I tried (not saying a country doesn't  have the right to be proud of their own  -  but leave it out of an action flick and focus on the movie itself).  Wont be missing out on much if u don't see this one. Excellent movies on my list include : No tears for the dead or Man from no where.,1443139200,4,689,4.294573643410852

7329788,4,B0118S6VPK,"I actually sorta liked this for a sub-titled movie.  It was interesting to see an operation from the Chinese point of view where they are the good guys.  I did often wonder if the equipment was authentic Chinese military stuff.  As one always seen in a movie like this, some of the action and actors are rather cheesy and unrealistic, but that is to be expected.  I will watch it a couple more times to see what I missed and to pay more attention to the small stuff to see if it realistic.",1442448000,,489,4.225806451612903

7329792,5,B0118S6VPK,"I never write reviews about movies I've seen on Amazon, but for some reason this one struck a familiar chord.  As an American, it is easy to forget how important one's country of origin can impact your way of life.  It doesn't matter whether or not I agree with the political climate of China.  What was important to me was how far these soldiers where willing to go, how much they were willing to sacrifice for their country.

If only we all felt this way.  It was an incredible movie - nuff said.",1441497600,8,498,4.311827956989247
7329793,5,B0118S6VPK,"When I hear the name Wu Jing, I picture in my mind a skillful martial arts killer (see, for example, him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Zone/dp/B003Q7B79M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Zone</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invisible-Target/dp/B003M9ZA74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invisible Target</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Triad-Wars/dp/B008U1ANCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Triad Wars</a>).

Wu Jing is a nice guy in Wolf Warrior. He plays Sergeant Leng Feng - an elite  soldier from the Chinese army. One day during a hostage rescue operation he eliminates a brother of Ming Deng - the most powerful and rich Asian drug lord. Ming Deng decides to avenge the death of his brother by hiring a group of top paid assassins from the West, led by Tom Cat (Scott Adkins).",1441065600,7,1256,9.37190082644628
7329794,4,B0118S6VPK,"Action movies do not have to be intricate for me to enjoy them.  On the contrary, they can be simplistic in nature, as long as the fighting is intense and fits into the storyline.  Such is the case with WOLF WARRIOR.  While the premise is basically a revenge story, the execution of the film is great, and the result is a top-notch action thriller.

Im quickly becoming a big fan of Wu Jing.  He is a very talented martial artist, but hes also a good actor.  Much like Jet Li, I enjoy seeing Wu Jing in whatever role he is undertaking.  This film permits him to showcase his skills as both an action star and a versatile actor.

WOLF WARRIOR is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The locations chosen for filming, however, look like they could be anywhere:  in the U.S., Asia, or even South America.  This isn't a negative, yet I was hoping to see some of the majestic Chinese landscape in the background.

The acting is very good for the most part, with the aforementioned Wu Jing in the lead.  His rival, Scott Adkins, does a great job with his role as well, but we don't get to see much of him.  I would have liked more character development, but this again isn't a major complaintmore of an observation.

The story starts off a bit slow, but quickly picks up steam.  And when the action gets going, things get hairy very fast.  My sole complaint here is that theres not many marital arts fight scenes.  The cover boasts breathtaking martial artsand what we get to see is good, however I wanted more.  Most of the fighting is gunplay.

Still WOLF WARRIOR is a lot of fun with frantic action and intense battles.  My absolute favorite scene is when Jings character Feng gives the Merc sniper whats coming to him.  I almost cheered.  WOLF WARRIOR is available today in a variety of formats, so check it out.",1441065600,6,1809,4.4316109422492405

skills would be well suited to the special-forces unit known as 'The Wolf Warriors'

enjoyable though not to be taken too seriously in-terms of martial-art/action movies.....make comparisons with many of

7329892,5,B0118S6VPK,"I came across this movie as a big Scott Adkins and Wu Jing fan.  Sure the nationalistic overtones were ham-fisted and groan-inducing at times, but no different from your typical Michael Bay movie.  On the other hand, the action scenes were very well done, with generally realistic tactical movements, reloading, accurate gear (check imfdb) and fingers off triggers.  This movie should appeal to anyone who likes believable cinematic gunplay.

This movie may be a disappointment to Scott Adkins and Wu Jing fans such as myself.  I was expecting a big climactic kung-fu showdown since both actors are exceptionally physically talented.  Instead, we have a more subdued concluding fight scene, but understandable given that they were going for a more 'realistic' fight.  Wolf Warriors had high production values and was quite entertaining.  Let's just hope they make a sequel that's all kung-fu.",1443657600,,892,5.276595744680851
