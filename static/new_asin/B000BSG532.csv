Additionally, I could not makes some functions work. Paper instructions were confusion and forums ended up being condescending.  After viewing this DVD (at my pace), I am using 75-80 % of kit vice  50% or less.  Very pleased with this product.",1419724800,,410,4.5479452054794525

8091809,4,B000BSG532,"There is a lot to my drum set, the TD-20 and the video tutorial is an easy way to learn about it. I found myself taking a few notes and also referring to the pdf users manual on Roland's site.",1259539200,,192,3.825
8091810,5,B000BSG532,"It's so much easier to learn about the multitude of functions available to the V-Drum user. From the proper set-up procedure to tweaking every aspect of the individual triggers. Just put the dvd in your laptop, set up next to your kit, and stop the video to allow a trial run of what was discussed in the chapter. Clear, consise footage...very well done.",1202860800,3,354,4.634920634920635
