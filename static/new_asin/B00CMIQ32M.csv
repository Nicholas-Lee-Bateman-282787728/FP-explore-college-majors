5728646,5,B00CMIQ32M,"I'm not aware of any other Scooby Doo stories set in Chicago.  It was fun seeing the Scooby Gang riding by famous landmarks in our city.  The plot is set around an Opera House that is not real, but it's fun that the Scooby Gang came to the real city of Chicago and had an adventure.  The movie has a lot of twists and turns in the plot so that it was a very difficult mystery to solve.  Few kids' movies keep adults guessing like this.

It was also a nice commentary on the American Idol phenomenon without it being too instantly-dated.  There was nothing in this that would lock the movie into the year 2013, so it should be great viewing in the future for many decades.  But at the same time it was fresh and current enough that watching it you get the pop culture references.  This is NOT like watching Aladdin and having all the jokes feel stale because Robin Williams made them about life in the early 1990s...the jokes made in this Scooby movie are very timeless.

The animation looked great...as good as the recent Scooby TV show Mystery Inc...but it had a more positive vibe to it than Mystery Inc (which, to me, was hard to watch sometimes because of the odd ""planetary disk"" plot).  I liked this Scooby movie better because there was no overarching larger plot and it was just about the gang solving a mystery like the old TV show.",1373155200,14,1341,4.370967741935484
5728647,5,B00CMIQ32M,"All Scooby-Doo episodes and movies contain promise, but some are better than others; hence, Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost are better remembered than Aloha or Chill Out.  Well, when I heard this one looked adventurous and parodied both Phantom of the Opera and American Idol I made the mistake of renting it. By mistake, I mean that I should have bought it to rewatch the multifaceted plot details. Just when you think they solved the mystery, there turns out to be more. Also, the gang shows their talent: Shaggy and Scooby act goofier than ever, Velma coins better one-liners, and Daphne and Fred sing their first duets. The characters are dynamic, especially ""Fraphne."" They even ponder the self-mimicking question, ""Are we the only ones who run into masked crooks?""

It includes a sewer slide, a stakeout, several chase scenes, and a perilous driving scene. But the biggest surprise is how it ends. Some shows have one bad guy in a mask, some have two, some have a real one, and some have both a fake and a real monster. (This one follows none of those patterns.) The gang faces danger in a sewer and on a bridge, but the overall tone is light. Fun and friendly for the kids, yet interesting enough for nostalgic adults. This one may just beat Zombie Island.

If that's not enough, the DVD and Blu-Ray discs also include two theater episodes from Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?",1372636800,36,1378,4.70954356846473
5728648,5,B00CMIQ32M,"I thought this was a good Scooby Doo movie, more than one villain, Daphne and Fred singing, it was over all enjoyable.  I would like to remind people that this is a Scooby Doo movie, made for enjoyment.",1372464000,13,202,4.315789473684211
5728649,2,B00CMIQ32M,"Shaggy and Scooby were great as usual. The rest was darker, nastier, & more threatening. Not fun and lighthearted like Scooby should be. It had the catty feel of the mystery inc. show, without many of the comedic relief of mystery inc. this was the worst of the newer scooby do movies in a while. Matthew Lillard is a great scooby though.",1372377600,3,338,4.467741935483871

5728651,5,B00CMIQ32M,"Many of the recent Scooby Doo movies have featured alot of 'in jokes' for an audience who might not get them.
This movie left that at the door in favor of spending more time on a decent script.

There's enough twist here to be original, i can't say it's a blatant rip off of a classic episode, like how Abracadabra Doo is literally a reversioning of Wednesday Is Missing without the Addams Family.

I can not point to an episode that inspires this movie but I can say that it's a great scooby romp.

I give it 5 star for quality, though I still feel a few of the movies are 'better', this movie earns it's stars.",1370736000,8,612,4.213675213675214

5728707,4,B00CMIQ32M,"Released in 2013, SCOOBY-DOO! STAGE FRIGHT is twentieth in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home market.

STAGE FRIGHT riffs on popular reality shows like American Idol and the stage musical The Phantom of the Operawith slight nods to Phantom of the Paradies, Svengali, and The Wizard of Oz, among others.  In this story, Fred and Daphne are in the finals of Star Talent, and Scooby and the gang head off to Chicago for the performance.  But the old opera house is haunted by a phantom who declares he wants a particular contestant to win: the incredibly obnoxious child singer Christine.

Pretty soon the various contestants begin to decamp one by one, leaving only Christine, violin prodigy Emma Gale, and Fred and Daphne to perform.  But is the phantom really the same phantom who haunted the opera house in the 1970s?  Or is it a newer model?  And why does it want Christine to win when it also seems intent on destroying the theatre before the performance can take place?  The plot is a bit more twisty than most Scooby Doo movies, and I thought it wore a bit thin toward the end, but fans will enjoy it.

I like to point out that, while no one would accuse the Scooby Doo cartoons of being great art, they are usually well done and entertaining.  It is always fun to revisit the gang, the plots cleverly make fun of their own clichs (in this film Fred tells Daphne that everyone must run into ghosts and monsters all the time, it would be too weird if it only happened to them) and the animation here is particularly sharp.  Recommended.

We purchased the Amazon instant video in November 2014.  Started having issues with the video in early January 2015.  Not sure if it this is just us, but it states that there is a License_Error on Kindle and Fire Phone and other errors on Wii and computers (only this video, out of the many we have).  Amazon is on the case so I hope they can figure it out, but if not we may have to find the dvd.  I am not sure if other had this problem, but just thought I would share.",1422921600,2,642,4.08

5728761,5,B00CMIQ32M,"This is the BEST Scooby Doo movie since The Witch's Ghost and Zombie Island.  Sure, ever since Abracadabra Doo they've all been great, but this one is outstanding.  The animation, as is the case since the 2010 movies, is great.  The color palette is darker and really evokes the feel of the 1997-2000 movies starting with Zombie Island, and it really works.
The story has so many twists and turns I didn't know where it would go next.  I won't spoil anything, but I will say there are more than one person dressing up as the phantom.  The fact that the gang has literally solved hundreds of cases is touched upon, and at the very end, they hear of another mystery and Velma gets crazy excited and so do Fred and Daphne, so it's obvious they keep doing it because they love it.  We also get a reason why Fred and Daphne aren't dating; they're both awkward young adults.
All in all this movie is the best Scooby Doo movie yet, and it's a must-see.",1406678400,,945,4.371428571428571

One other thing that I enjoy about the vast titles is it almost in every case it's a real person in the end that is at fault. Not like most other movies it's demonic force or entity that causes the crime or circumstance. So even the kids can enjoy it with out being shell shocked by the story also the hole family can enjoy it. I definitely support and recommend this movie to all!!!!,1395014400,,523,4.188118811881188

I loved watching Scooby-Doo back in the day and figured I'd share some of that joy with the little monster. I will not make that mistake again. Apparently the creators of this new age Scooby-Doo felt that what kids love in their entertainment is a little bit of romance. I mean, how else are they going to figure out that the good looking guy and gal main characters cannot help but develop feelings for each other? I see this often injected in other kids entertainment these days. I may be wrong, but I do not recall part of the plot including OBVIOUS tension between the two characters in almost every scene where they were alone together. On top of that, they littered it with a lot of unnecessary aggression and catty behavior.  This is why we watch movies together, so I can fast forward and/or skip ahead if need be,lol. Next time I'll search for the original series of this classic and avoid all the romantic and sexual overtones that seem to be ever present these days.",1382140800,4,1112,4.5049504950495045

5728820,5,B00CMIQ32M,"The series always goes along well,following on a tried and tested approach. An iconic bunch of characters since 1969. I personally found this one not as good as the previous,Blue Falcon,but when you regularly bring out straight to DVD movies you'll always have some better than others. Alien Invaders and Zombie Island come to mind as better ones but,generally,they are all good. Possibly,the only one that seemed of poor quality/weak storyline,plot was Reluctant Werewolf but,hey.....the kids like them,so that's what counts.",1379462400,,526,5.506172839506172
5728821,4,B00CMIQ32M,"Each new animated Scooby movie makes me love it more than the previous. Maybe it is the new ideas, maybe it's the graphics and colors. I thought Phantosaur was great but Blue Falcon was better and this is even better than both. The story keeps you guessing, when you think you have it figured out there's a twist that proves you wrong. Just like with the gang. Without giving away specifics, it's a perspective that I don't think we've seen before.

I'm a die hard Scooby fan so there isn't much I don't like (except the new Mystery Inc series is not my thing, I don't like the animation AT ALL). I will admit that some of the jokes are not geared for kids and I think they are more designed for adult viewers. But kids can still enjoy the visual even if they don't understand the punch line. Scooby is still cute no matter what.",1379203200,,829,4.314102564102564
5728822,4,B00CMIQ32M,"I've been a Scooby Doo fan for years and have thoroughly enjoyed many of the older animated movies (Scooby Doo and the Ghoul School, Scooby Doo on Zombie Island). In more recent years, the animated movies haven't been up to par and haven't matched the quality of the older movies. ""Scooby Doo Stage Fright,"" however, was definitely a step in the right direction towards getting back to the quality of the Scooby Doo movies. It was funny and gave a new spin to the regular ""catching the villain"" formula. Another thing that was great about this movie was how they spun both ""Phantom of the Opera"" and all the reality talent shows into this movie and made it kid friendly. This is one worth a viewing or two (or three, or four...)!",1378598400,6,729,4.53030303030303

5728824,4,B00CMIQ32M,If you like the Phantom of the Opera (I did) and you love Scooby Doo ( I rally doo!) you'll want to add this to your collection. I love that I was able to get it 5 weeks earlier if I ordered through Amazon rather than waiting for the DVD to come out. I found this to be witty and a surprise ending. I have a large collection of Scooby Doo. I usually watch at least one episode a night. Truly it is sleeping pill. Nothing relaxes me more than knowing Scooby is on the case.,1377820800,6,472,3.9270833333333335

5728827,5,B00CMIQ32M,"It's cute, touching, exciting, scarey. The songs are catchy and cute. Such twists and turns. It shows these kids of today how to be UNselfish and how to help those that aren't as lucky as others. Thumbs up Gang!",1377043200,,211,4.435897435897436

5728829,5,B00CMIQ32M,"I grew up on Scooby-Doo so I have no problem admitting that I was WAY more excited than my kids to watch Scooby-Doo Stage Fright on Blu-Ray! I wanted to share the magic of this goofy dog with my kids.

I did consider that my kids don't like to be scared but at the same time, they don't scare too easily so I figured we'd give it a shot. When a phantom appears within the first couple of minutes I asked my four year old if he was scary and she replied ""no, he's just silly."" I like bad guys that don't scare my kids!

From the haunting melody at the beginning, I knew it would be true to the classic feel of Scooby Doo. While the colors are more vibrant and distinct, the appearance does justice to the original cartoon I grew up on. It looks exactly the same, only better. With an American Idol like competition involved, it keeps the spirit of the original with a modern day spin.

True to the character of the original show Scooby and the gang are out to solve a mystery involving some ghosts and bad guys. For parents who don't like their kids watching anything with ghosts and bad guys as a theme, this is probably not for them. I do keep my kids away from things that are evil but the spirit of Scooby has always been pure and as always, ""ghosts"" aren't always who or what they appear to be.

Scooby-Doo Stage Fright is fun filled and silly with the usual antics from the gang and the lovable Scooby-Doo keeping things light and happy.",1376956800,4,1442,4.2327272727272724
5728830,5,B00CMIQ32M,Kids loved this movie!  Scooby is their favorite and any time they are doing a little musical number makes them happy.,1373414400,,118,4.619047619047619
8583465,3,B00CMIQ32M,Good Scooby Doo flick and as usual the gangs are back along with the big dog himself Scooby Doo! The disc comes with a dvd and blue ray combo so I will give the blue ray a review instead. Picture is bright and sharp on this blue ray version and the dvd is not so bad but HD is the way to go if you have a blue ray player and an HD screen for sure! Now the only way I didn't give this a five star is because lately the directors of this line of Scooby doo features are not using the main iconic Scooby Doo theme song which they have used in the old tv series and previous Scooby Doo features. Also I do miss the old talent voices with the exception of Frank Welker who voiced Fred and Scooby from the very beginning of the series. But it is still a great addition to your Scooby Doo library to watch for relaxing evening after a hard day's work.,1528243200,,844,3.9415204678362574

8583468,4,B00CMIQ32M,"I liked the uniqueness of this Scooby Doo movie in that there were several people who portrayed the phantom and for a variety of reasons.  The pseudo-romance between Daphne and Fred detracted from the continuity of Scooby, however.",1517011200,,231,5.078947368421052
