8606937,5,B00EN3QO5K,The instructor was fantastic.  She showed how to execute each step and the hand and arm movements to coincide with each step. I enjoyed the guitarist and drummer. as well.,1491091200,2,171,4.7

8606939,1,B00EN3QO5K,"Do not waste your money on this product! Having had classes before and wanting to learn the structure and footwork of the specified dances listed on the title, I purchased this item in the hope that it will deliver what it promised. She does not go into the structure for either dance. She only shows you the Marcaje for the Solea por Bulerias, and the Yamada for the Bulerias section at the end, but misses everything in between. On the tangos she shows you only exaggerated hip movements. Braceos are shown properly. There is a bonus section at the end in Spanish about Alegrias. That should have been done either on the Tangos or Solea por Bulerias instead. I am sure she is a good teacher while in class, but whoever directed this video has no idea of Flamenco at all.",1398211200,13,772,4.4822695035460995
8606940,4,B00EN3QO5K,I really enjoy the dvd. In this dvd it is explained how to count the rhythm in flamenco dancing. But if you want step by step how to learn flamenco this is not the dvd you want to purchase.,1387238400,8,189,3.871794871794872
