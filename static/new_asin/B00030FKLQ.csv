8035793,5,B00030FKLQ,"This is a British recreation of the assassination blended into much German and Czech footage contemporary with the event.  It is very well done and it is especially interesting to see the sites where the deed took place.  The actual planner of The Holocaust, Heydrich was one of the worst humans in the Nazi regime.  He might well have been Hitler's successor had he not been killed by the brave Czechs and Slovaks, Josef Gabcik, Jan Kubis, and Josef Valcik.  A toast to them seventy years later!  Really great men who eradicated a Nazi not only monstrous but also efficient and competent unlike many others, including Hitler himself. Even considering Lidice, Kubis and Gabcik saved the lives of countless Europeans who would otherwise have been slaughtered had Heydrich survived.  The film has harrowing German footage of the destruction of Lidice which the Nazis did as revenge for Heydrich's death.",1345248000,6,901,5.0134228187919465
