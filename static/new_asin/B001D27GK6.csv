8291279,5,B001D27GK6,"Brilliant pioneering work in a genre that is rapidly becoming a caricature of itself. (Google bulls*** hipster motorcycle videos) The main character, Meatball, is the real deal: a motorcycle racer,  builder/outsider, rock and roll hero, presented here with his cronies and henchmen in Southern California's vintage Brit-bike sub-culture.  Good time movie that hits far more times than it misses. I've watched it several times and it is always a hoot.",1435795200,,450,5.414285714285715
8291280,5,B001D27GK6,"I first watched this with the excitement of a vintage enthusiast, as there are so few ""movies"" available in the genre. I liked it a lot. Then I watched with some bike buddies, all of whom were younger than I and ride new sport bikes. It was voted boring and turned off after a half hour. Not exciting enough.
Here is why I liked it. The people in this film are real. Nothing really special except being ordinary guys living life with all things motorcycle. Racing in every style race they can find. On every type bike they could get rolling fast enough to put a smile on their face. Not about competition, about fun. Wrenching and riding through life as true enthusiasts. Hangin' with loyal friends, playing in bands, going to clubs, drinking a few beers with great girlfriends and building motorcycles. Old British bikes. Not 'Bling' monsters. Just cheap, fun, ridable, and very cool bikes. And doing it all in motorcycle Mecca, sunny southern California. These people are living the life and have it made, and I wish I were part of it. I'd be happy to call them friends.
Don't think of it as a ""movie"". Just that you've been invited into a close circle of friends to watch for awhile. They just happen to love motorcycles.",1231286400,2,1224,4.568181818181818
