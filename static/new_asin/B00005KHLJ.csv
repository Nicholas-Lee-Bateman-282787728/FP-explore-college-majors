7943382,5,B00005KHLJ,came to me on time and I'm late for this review a couple years late but it plays perfectly and i love the orginal!,1511481600,,114,3.7916666666666665
7943383,5,B00005KHLJ,"This may be by far one of the best sagas ever, trunks is kool, he defeated freiza, the trunk saga is a very sad one as well, the death of gohan in trunk's world affected him so deeply, and the other ones, where kool, but then again said and unfortanate, although I still reccomend any dbz(dragon ball z) fan SHOULD buy it. Because it is truly worth it! I reccomend it!:)!",1026345600,,371,4.23943661971831
7943384,5,B00005KHLJ,"Ok, if you love action/comedy movies then you'd love almost any Japanimation movie ever.
As you know this saga is all about Trunks. It's a really great collectible for your collection.
The four movies show when he first went back to the past, and about HIS past.
It really helps give his background and helps you understand more about the whole series of Dragon Ball Z.
Secrets are unlocked about Trunks and Goku's goofy self is still evident in these movies as will always be.
If you really want to know more about these movies, buy them and see for yourself. I'm guessing it's mostly for the ""ultimate"" Trunks fan if that's how you see it.
Other than that if you're an anime lover get this, you'll enjoy it. It's worth your time.",1025827200,,731,4.503759398496241
7943385,5,B00005KHLJ,"Okay let me start off by saying my bro got me into this series. I've seen the series off and on on cable and then saw some ""uncut"" versions. I gotta say the uncut was definately better. One of the tapes is the 'history of Trunks' it is a mini-movie of how life is on Earth during his timeline the only surviving sayian, besides himself ,is Gohan (his master/best friend). Together they try to defeat a pair of androids that are running around destroying things and in this version ,shows how Trunks turns Super-Sayian for the first time.(Gohan dies by the way).Which ultimately led up to him time-traveling to change things. I strongly suggest you watch this first, it gives more ""oh so that's why!"" to the rest of the tapes.
Mysterious Youth-The next two episodes are leading up to Frieza's arrival on Earth and Trunks introduction to the 'past'.Vegita comes back unable to find Gohan in space, Gohan is burdend with a tutor, Frieza and his dad arrive on earth. The other z fighters go to intercept but Trunks arrives first and finishes both Frieza and his dad before the others can turning Super-Sayian and in the process driving Vegita mad,since he himself has been unable to do so.
Prelude to Terror-This is my favorite, Goku comes back and asks who defeated Freiza and so meets Trunks. Trunks asks Goku to talk in private revealing who he is, and the timeline in which he lives. Goku seems to find Trunks origins more interesting then the prophecy given to him, and his reactions had me laughing right along with him  :).Along with the prophecy Trunks give Goku an antidote to a virus he'll catch 2 years from then.
Z Warriors Prepare-Gohan,Goku,and Piccolo go off to train,Vegeta pushes himself to the edge (indirectly stirring Bulma's maternal instincts and planting the seeds for their involvment). Yamcha finally gets it together and also goes off to train.
Goku's ordeal- okay this episode seems to be all comic relief. Goku is forced to learn how to drive and Piccolo is dragged along for the ride! The antics these two go through is just too funny to put into words. I had to watch this several times,it put a big :) on my face.",1022803200,8,2140,4.646437994722955
7943386,5,B00005KHLJ,"These are the tapes to the Trunks Saga
 The first is: Mysterious Youth. Where Trunks arrives and fights Freeza.
 The next is: Prelude to Terror. Trunks and the other Z Fighters await the arrival of Goku.
 The next is: Z Warriors Prepare. Goku and the others prepare to fight the androids. And includes a review of DBZ up to that point.
 The final is: The History of Trunks. You can guess that this is the History of Trunks. It explains the past that was never seen in the episodes
 I would recommend this box set. The end of Freeza is too cool.",1012780800,4,544,4.294117647058823
7943387,5,B00005KHLJ,Well If you haven't guessed already these 4 tapes are: 3 tape trunks saga and the history of trunks special. If you haven't watched any of these before i recomend you to buy this now as the trunks saga is soo cool and History of trunks special is 1 of the best movies anime has ever released. These Videos are edited.,993081600,5,317,4.213114754098361
7943388,5,B00005KHLJ,"so I'm gonna start.  Firstly, I can't tell from what info is given EXACTLY what this is, but I'm guessing it's the Trunks Saga and the History of Trunks movie if it's 4 tapes.  I've seen the movie, and all the Trunks Saga episodes, so I can say, they are GOOD!  The movie is supurb, with an exillant sound track.  The episodes are great too (the between-saga sagas are always good^^). I hope I'm guessing right, but even if I'm wrong, If it's got Trunks in it, it has to be good.",991612800,4,479,4.173913043478261
