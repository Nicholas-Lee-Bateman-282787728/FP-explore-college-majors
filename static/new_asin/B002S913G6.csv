8379141,5,B002S913G6,"A prime example of a legitimately great show that sadly just never got the mainstream recognition it deserved, ""United States of Tara"" is a comedy-drama series that ran for three seasons on premium network Showtime between 2009 and 2011.  Though it was a critical darling and took home several major awards throughout its three-year run, it just never really caught on with average viewers.  Which is a terrible shame, because it's definitely well-worth checking out for all open-minded audiences!  It's not for everyone, but if you can go along with it, it's just sublime start-to-finish.

Created by Diablo Cody and based loosely on a concept by Steven Spielberg, the series follows the titular Tara (Toni Collette), an otherwise average mom with one peculiar quirk- she has multiple personality disorder.  Over the three seasons, whenever she becomes stressed, she transfers between a host of ""alters"" (including spoiled teen ""T"", posh 50's housewife ""Alice"", redneck ""Buck"", and several others), much to the chagrin of her sister (Rosemarie DeWitt), her husband (John Corbett) and her children.

Much of the excellent first season revolves around Tara trying to cope with her alters after she stops taking a medication that suppresses them, and her struggle to find the cause of her disorder.  Along the way, we are also treated to an array of subplots involving the various family-members.  We get to see young love through the eyes of her gay son Marshall (Keir Gilchrist), her teenage daughter Kate's (Brie Larson) first steps into adulthood and her husband Max's struggles to keep the family together.  There's also a couple really fun subplots involving her ever-struggling sister Charmaine; and a fantastic recurring guest-spot by comedian Patton Oswalt, whom plays an old friend of Max that has the hots for Charmaine.

The charm of this series is how it deftly balances both subtle humor and genuine emotion with ease, in no small part thanks to its expert writing and absolutely jaw-dropping performances.  In just about every way, this show works- and works darned well.  You can feel the influence of both Cody and Spielberg throughout each episode, and everyone involved knocks it out of the park.  Especially Collette, whom is basically playing multiple characters in each episode courtesy Tara's dissociative identity disorder.  Theres a reason Collette won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for the part- this is a career-defining role, and she is completely outstanding.

And while this DVD release is a bit on the bare-bones side in terms of bonus content, I have to give it a perfect 5 out of 5 due to its outstanding price and the high quality of the series.  Its a must-by as far as Im concerned.  And given you can pick it up for less than $10... Its a steal!

The story of United States of Tara is a tragic one- it never quite got the respect or exposure it deserved despite its high quality.  But its a ride well worth-taking, and it holds up marvelously.  If you haven't seen it, please do check it out.  It comes highly recommended!",1523404800,,3059,4.947162426614481

8379146,3,B002S913G6,I have been a big fan of Brie Larson and thought give this show a try it being one of her earlier works. I liked Brie Larson's character but not the whole story line as a whole. It was okay to watch but not my kind of tv viewing.,1461542400,,229,3.693877551020408
