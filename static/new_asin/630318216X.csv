It definitely can be a good starting point for people interested in step aerobics, but only if they have no other stepping experience and are woefully out of shape.  There really is very little fitness value in this video (come on, guys - even with my step at the highest level I can only get my heart rate six beats above resting) and has questionable instructional value in this day and age.

I also question some of Marsha Macro's statements during her frantic warmup - particularly about getting ""oil in the joints"". I think she's talking about how warming up moves fluid into your joints and how that benefits your body, but I'm fairly certain that it's not ""oil"" that is moving into your joints, but water-based fluid.

I personally think Jane Fonda's two step videos are much better starting points than this video and will encourage freshman steppers to try more and keep exercising.",1180656000,2,1066,4.679144385026738
591907,5,630318216X,"This is a great step workout for beginners and intermediate. Advanced will also like this workout if they use a higher step platform. I use about a 8 inch platform. The moves are real easy to follow. I like easy to follow moves using a high step bench. Beginners will love this tape because it is so easy to follow,it is also fun. Marsha Macro Leads a great routine that is sure to please.",1162339200,,389,4.27027027027027
591908,5,630318216X,"I started stepping about 1 1/2 years ago.  Out of sheer luck, this video was the first step workout I found.  I'm glad it was.  I did not consider myself to be in bad shape; however, I had not stepped since a high school P.E. class nine years earlier.  My calves burned big time and I had to rest in the middle of the workout.  After a while, I got to learn the moves, added additional stretches for my calf muscles, and flew through the routine!  Now I use it when I feel tired but still want to get my workout in or when I'm hard-pressed for time.  I also use this tape when I want to try a higher step level.
This video is perfect for the beginning stepper because Marsha Macro's combinations are so simple.  She introduces you to the basic step, how to change legs while stepping, and the over-the-top move.  In fact, over-the-top and knee lifts are probably the most complicated moves on this video.  Her moves are very deliberate and are clearly explained.  There are no steppers in the background which may be confusing for beginners and there are no fancy arm movements.  Only the natural arm marching movement is used.  The workout also only lasts 20 minutes, including a warm-up, cool-down, and stretch.  It's finished before you know it.  Plus, by adding propulsion
(incorporating some power moves and getting the arms in the air) and using a higher step height than usual, one can get a higher level workout in a short period of time!",1014681600,6,1446,4.486590038314176

7840613,5,630318216X,"This is an excellent starting point for the beginner or for those looking to get back into exercise/step after a long hiatus. It's a great ""starting over"" video.
The entire workout is less than 30 minutes but it is effective. The instructor, Marsha Maco, is very pleasant and is excellent at cueing. The choreography is simple and uncomplicated which is of the utmost importance to me given that my brain and my feet are wired for simple and uncomplicated.
The tape is from 1990 and is very simply done (just Marsha and her step) which I find kind of refreshing.

After breaking your body in I highly recommend the step video ""Moving with Susan Powter"" (yes, that Susan Powter). There is no crazy choreography and, while it definitely has more movements and is higher intensity, it is for all fitness levels and you can easily modify (as some of the people in the video do) and work your way up through it. Great calorie burner. (May have to search the net for it.)",1346284800,,965,4.578034682080925
7840614,5,630318216X,"I have used this video almost everyday for the past 10 years. It is easy but also fun and not too repetitive.
It takes about 25 minutes to get through so it's not a huge commitment but still gets my heart rate up. I have kept my weight within 5 pounds for the past 10 years even through menopause. If you have picture in picture on your TV you can still watch your favorite shows while doing your workout.
Even my husband does it now :)

7840615,3,630318216X,"NOTE - This is a review for the Buns of Steel 2 Beginner step workout with Leisa Hart, released in 1994.

I never knew that this workout even existed, recently stumbling on it I thought I would give it a try.  I have
tried many of the workouts in the Buns of Steel series over the years, some of them I really liked, others were just
okay for me.

Over the past few months, I have been getting back into exercise after a year plus break.  I have always liked step aerobics and would say that my level was a solid intermediate, even though my preference is basic or simpler choreography.

This workout is very basic, and even absolute beginners may outgrow it very quickly.  You will see basic steps, alternating steps (called basic alternates), A steps, V steps, L steps, over the tops, and charlestons.  Leisa Hart does a fine job leading the workout, cues well, and has a pleasant and professional demeanor.

My personal gripe with this workout is there are WAY too many step taps in between moves, I feel they should be there as a transition from one move to the next but not an overdose of them, I thought it was excessive.  While I feel that I got a decent workout, I found myself very bored with this workout and couldn't wait for it to be over. Yes, it is a beginner workout, but it could have moved a little bit faster.

Ah well, as I mentioned earlier, I never even knew this workout was out there, maybe not many of them were sold and quickly disappeared, who knows.

I am still glad that I gave it a try though, I enjoy finding vintage workouts and I feel this time period (early 90's) was a great age for step workouts.  I just wish this one was a little more interesting, I like basic workouts, but this was too basic for me.

I rate this 3 and a half stars, because it does what it advertises. But there are far more interesting beginner step workouts out there.",1258761600,,1876,4.310541310541311
