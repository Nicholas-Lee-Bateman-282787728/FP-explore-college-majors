Though the titling may confuse some fans who were unaware of this, it's still an amazing collection.",1350000000,,308,5.0588235294117645

It was just like being home when this was on. We really enjoyed it. It's one of the most tolerable teen shows from an adult point of view. In fact, I actually enjoy it.",1347580800,,342,4.196969696969697

4397173,5,B004KL0OW4,"Hi Amazon Buyer, Dan Schneider had split the season in half after 45 episodes were ordered for Season 2 & 3 but he did not change the Production Codes to 3xx for Season 3
for the split.
Dan Schneider had kept Season 3 in the 2xx Production Codes that made
Season 4 in the 3xx Production Codes.
Now it all mass up the season for iCarly by confusing lots of peoples over the
internet.
For this DVD, It the completed Season 3.
It not Season 2, Vol 3.

Do you want this fix, Than please sign the Petition at Change.org &

4397175,5,B004KL0OW4,"Found this press release with a specific and more accurate episode list :)

[...]

As far as I can tell, for the most part all the episodes are there, and in correct order, with the exception of maybe the movies.

So it looks like if you get Season 1 Vol. 1&2 and Season 2 Vol, 1,2,&3 you will have all the episodes and TV movies before the current season.

I will confirm as I get the DVDs.

I love this show!!",1299196800,,411,4.0246913580246915

4397188,5,B004KL0OW4,"My 5yr old loves iCarly and was bummed when they took it off the air. I bought some of the iCarly season's on dvd so she could still watch them and also since we weren't stuck watching the same ones over and over. My 11 yr old and 13 yr old were still watching iCarly until they took it off the air and they still watch these dvd's from time to time especially if my 5yr old turns it on.  This Season 2 Volume 3 has 3 dvd's opposed to the Season 2 Volume 2 having 2 discs. This one runs 462 minutes split up amongst the 3 dvds.
