I was given this as a gift and started using it when my daughter was about 3 months old. It was so nice to turn on the DVD and stretch and bond together, especially because finding time to get ready and pack her up to go to the gym was nearly impossible. Beyond feeling exhausted from just trying to get everything ready to leave to workout, I would also feel guilty for leaving her to workout. (ugh.... mommy guilt) This helped alleviate all of that, we were able to stay together, bond, play, and I got a workout in. =) What more could I ask for.... I loved this so much that as she became more mobile I looked into other DVD's and found the toddler dance version, which we now use and love as well. I would recommend this for every mommy and baby out there, especially for the first time moms like me that find it difficult to juggle life and baby time.",1298592000,5,972,4.2032085561497325
