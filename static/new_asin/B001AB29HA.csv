8276571,4,B001AB29HA,To answer the title question YES. Where did the terrorists get super thermite whose flakes of it were mixed in the debris of the twin towers. And what was the explanation of the towers falling a free fall speed? No other buildings have fallen like that before 9/11 or after. And how did Building 7 come down? The almighty U S government can not answer why.,1387065600,,356,4.409090909090909
8276572,4,B001AB29HA,"Although I have not seen this particular DVD on 911, he is correct about the inside job facilitated and effectuated by the US government. The plans however had been in the works for a while. Consider after the 93 'bombing' another inside job demolition of the former Vista Hotel, and in the parking garage under 2? WTC, but the concourse was reconfigured and there were ALWAYS dumpsters in the complex. ALWAYS. So the packing of the complex with demolition to pull off the OP is easy to understand. And the photos of 6WTC show how clean that cut was UP through that building which was blow UP before either tower came down and 1WTC which was most close to 6WTC which was blow up approx 9am or so, 2WTC came down before 1WTC, again and the later was most close to 6WTC.

And 7 without question was professionally demolished. Listenign that afternoon to live public radio in NY when WNYC's radio reporter was on site talking about Silverstien and the firemen having a conversation about demolishing 7wtc and moments later it was fully DEMOLISHED into its foundation. Considering burning buildings aren't demolished nor can you get experts to go into a burning building to put in the proper demolition in order to bring it down into its foundations; this sort of professional planting of demolition takes days, and weeks in a building as large as 7WTC was. So critical thinking: there already was demolition in the building and silverstein giving the order to bring it down, which on PBS he admitted he told the firemen to bring it down, can only happen if there already was professional demolition in that building. Now later in the day that building was brought down after 1WTC and 2WTC were professionally demolished. That meant that those 1WTC and 2WTC victims -that the those companies in those buildings were either not aware there was professional demolition in the towers and/or if they did know that they are accessories before and after the fact to either the 'terrorist' attacks or that the government had planned these terrible acts of destruction and their own employees were going to be used for that what could be called some form of treason but those employees were used as martyrs and flailing devices/bully pulpit for the cause of whatever the reason the 5th column in our gov and society planned this Reichstag.

Griffen may not have all the details about the why or all the who who done it, but it is/was an inside job. And if I hadnt been there when 6WTC went up behind me, I may have had a hard time believing the US goverment was culpable for something so sociapathic, but that is how the 4th Reich is and that's what we're now seeing with the inside job financial 'crisis', the tyranny of 'free' trade and neo-feudal/fascist corporate power on the US, the risk of the US becoming a vassel state for EU/Teuton/neocon-trotskyesque interests, things like this. 911 was a way to throw assets and tribute into the hands of bushfamily chums, while also contributing to obscuring the contracting of the US economy given all the nontariff'd trade done under the 'free' trade agreements to suit the Germans and the G20 constraints on the US economy.",1298678400,4,3161,4.745454545454545
8276573,5,B001AB29HA,"David Griffin brilliantly and eloquently analyses the main block to acceptance by the American public that their government has perpetrated, and continues to perpetrate, acts of the utmost evil that would make the Founding Fathers turn in their graves.",1256169600,4,252,5.487179487179487
8276574,5,B001AB29HA,"In this documentary, David Ray Griffin sets out to explain his position on 9/11.  He gives credible, logical and well articulated responses to some of the many fallacies given in the 9/11 Commission Report.  The lecture Griffin gives is concurrently thought provoking and bloodcurdling.  Griffin does an amazing job critically analyzing facts surrounding the events of 9/11 to come to logical and well thought out conclusions.

The subject matter in the film contains information such as the Pentagon strike, the World Trade Center and the preexisting knowledge of the attacks.  Some of the information in the Pentagon attacks was new to me, such as the fact that the Pentagon is protected with an anti aircraft/missile defense system, and things that were not new, such as the collapse of WTC Building 7 due to fire (which was on a mere 2 floors of the nearly 50 story building).  I also liked the fact that Griffin pointed out that no building constructed the same or similar to the World Trade Center had previously, or subsequently, collapsed due to fire.  Without giving the rest of the film away that is all I will speak of the evidence he gives but there are many fascinating details given.

The only problem I had with this documentary were Griffins closing statements.  In retrospect it should have been no surprise to me that Griffin, a deeply religious man (he is a Professor of theology and religion), would throw in the religious implications and how people of religion should act given the knowledge of the facts surrounding 9/11.  I don't personally feel that it was necessary to force the religious aspect in because the reality is that all American citizens, no matter their religious denominations or beliefs, would have the same moral outrage given the knowledge from this film.  Admittedly this is but a small part of the film and does no real disservice to the facts of the film.

Conclusively I feel that Griffins film is incredibly informative and well articulated.  I give Griffin great credit and applause for his ability to take factual information, critically analyze it and come to a conclusion that is difficult to accept but there can honestly be no other conclusion.  Fantastic job Dr. Griffin.",1234915200,,2225,4.93029490616622
8276575,5,B001AB29HA,"If you're new to investigating ""9/11"" or approach it from the other side of the issue and all you have heard about Dr. David Ray Griffin is that he's a theologian who disbelieves the official story of what happened that day may expect him to give an emotion based appeal based on a dislike of American foreign policy something in the line of ""the government could have done it and the Bush administration clearly benefited from it, so they probably did it."" But Griffin's not that kind of theologian -- he's more like my idea (and I'm afraid I'm very ignorant of theology, so take this with a grain of salt) of what a Jesuit intellectual is like: highly rational, practical, and skilled in clear thinking and argument.

In this talk he builds on a point he's made in other talks and books, that it's the people who defend the ""official conspiracy theory"" (the one  about the guys with the box cutters) who use faulty logic to back their case. Specifically, they argue that since the US government COULD not have taken part in such a horrendous event, any attempts to point out faults in the official story MUST be at fault themselves. They make an a priori statement which they accept as true and make deductions from it. An earlier Griffin talk, ""Let's Get Empirical"", shows how empirical (fact based, subject to testing) evidence proves the official story to be false. In this one he looks specifically at how ""nationalist faith"" the idea that one's country cannot do serious wrong, a belief especially strong in the United States, strongly colors the way Americans look at 9/11. As in all of his work on 9/11, his emphasis is on reviewing the empirical evidence, presenting the most up to date research on what we know to have happened and not happened, and putting the information into a logical framework. You won't go wrong on any time you spend listening to David Ray Griffin.",1234051200,7,1883,4.668674698795181
8276576,5,B001AB29HA,David Ray Griffin does an excellent job of explaining the falsehood of the official story of 911.  With his systematic method of revealing the truth about what happened and showing the official story full of holes David Ray Griffin is able to help the layman understand the truth. I would recommend anyone who is looking for truth about the attacks on the trade center and building 7 to see anything by Dr. David Ray Griffin.,1203897600,2,425,4.666666666666667
