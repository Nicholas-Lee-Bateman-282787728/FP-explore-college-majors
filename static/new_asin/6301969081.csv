I loved the acting, the singing was not a great as Judy's others like ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" or ""Easter Parade"" but I'm proud to be a fan of  Judy.

388951,2,6301969081,"As much as I admire Judy Garland, I'm afraid that this film can't hold a candle to the superb romantic comedy THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, from which it borrows its plot. The main defect is that Garland and Johnson are so  overpowering in their detestation of each other that it is completely  unbelievable for them to then suddenly realize that they are in love. There  is no transition, no preparation for the abrupt reversal. Nobody can outdo  Judy when she turns on the scorn and vituperation, and she just overdoes it  to an irrevocable degree. Also the music doesn't amount to much. Now if you  want to see an excellent musical version of the SHOP AROUND THE CORNER  plot, find a stage performance of SHE LOVES ME, one of the most delightful  musicals ever created.",940118400,6,770,4.610294117647059

It is one of the few films where the material is up to the par of its magnificent star. Her renderings of the songs here is beyond  great -- especially the joyous ""Play That Barbershop Chord.""  Boy, could she put a number over, like nobody before or ever since!
For  an MGM flick, this movie is remarkably UNcloying, and the plot is pretty  cute. Van Johnson actually generates electricity (!) in the second to final  scene where he confesses his love to Garland.

389119,4,6301969081,"Released by MGM in 1949, and directed by Robert Z Leonard, In The Good Old Summertime is a musical remake of the 1940 film, The Shop Around The Corner, which starred James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan.  Although I liked the original film, In The Good Old Summertime takes on a life of its own.

The story in this version takes place in Chicago IL. at the turn of the century, and is centered around OBerkugen's Music Store, primarily around Christmas time.  That is why the title is misleading.

Judy Garland plays Veronica Fisher, a young woman who has fallen in love with a man she corresponds to through the mail.  What she doesn't know is that her pen pal is her co worker, Andrew Larkin (Van Johnson), a cocky young saleman,whom she despises.  In fact, they spend so much time sparring with each other that after awhile, you begin to wonder how on earth could these two people, who are always getting on each other's nerves, ever have a romantic relationship, let alone fall madly in love with each other...Only in Hollywood

But the movie does redeem itself on many levels.  The setting of a music store is the perfect excuse for us to hear Garland stretch those glorious vocal chords of her's, and the characters within the music store are also unforgettable.  The supporting cast is superb, with some of the best character actors that MGM had on its roster at the time.  Hungarian actor S. K. Sakall, plays Mr Otto Oberkugen, the store's portly and stubborn owner who is engaged to marry his long time lady friend, Nellie Burke (Spring Byington).  Silent film comedy legend, Buster Keaton, plays Mr Oberkugen's inept and brow beaten nephew, Mr Hickey, and veteran MGM character actor, Clinton Sundberg, plays Rudy Hanson, who is Andrew Larkin's best friend and voice of reason.  Then there is Marcia Van Dyke, who plays Louise Parkson.  She's very pretty, and a very talented violinist, but definitely not a convincing actress.

Like Easter Parade, and Meet Me In St Louis, In The Good Old Summertime is a visual treat for the eyes, with colorful sets and period costumes.  The songs are great too, and Garland is at the top of her form, even though her life at this point,was in turmoil.  She looks absolutely beautiful.  The final scene in the film between Garland and Van Johnson was daringly seductive for the year 1949, and is very memorable indeed.  Unfortunately, after this film, Judy Garland's health and career would continue their downward spiral.  After completing Summer Stock the following year, at age 28, her career at MGM would be over.  This is also the last film for Buster Keaton at MGM, a studio he had been with since 1928.  In fact, he was originally brought on board just for consultation purposes, but he was eventually offered a part because no one else could properly execute a crucial pratfall that was needed toward the end of the movie.

In the end, some people will like it, and some people won't.  But its a pleasant way to pass by a couple of hours.  I would recommend this film to anyone who likes MGM musicals, is a Judy Garland fan, a Van Johnson fan, or a Buster Keaton fan.",1379289600,2,3120,4.661791590493602

Garland's songs are first rate and nostalgic.  She has never sounded better in a film, and that's saying something.  Her comedic lines are spot on.  If it weren't for Van Johnson (where was Gene Kelly????) this would have been a class musical.  Not that Johnson doesn't have ""class"" or ""style""...but I guess SOMEONE had to work with Judy at this point in time.  So they say.

Yet she is THERE, from the first moment to last, singing and dancing and tossing of one liners that Katharine Hepburn would envy.  Why those two women, at the same studio at the same time, never co-starred is beyond me.

It's still a great show.  The score has some startling and thrilling moments and Garland certainly delivers the goods.  Awesome.

389248,5,6301969081,"I watched The Shop Around the Corner a few months ago and really liked the movie, although I did think there were major flaws in that there seemed no reason for Mr. Kralik to actually fall in love with Miss Novak since she was portrayed as mean to him all the time with no redeeming qualities (that he could have possibly noticed). Miss Novak explains at the end that she had been attracted to him but since she thought she was involved with someone else, she tried to repel her feelings by being a jerk. There was no indication of this before that scene and there seemed no way Mr. Kralik could have noticed it either. The ending also makes Miss Novak out to be sort of dumb and pretty vain (although obviously intended to be cute and funny).

This version improved every part of The Shop Around the Corner. One could actually see Miss Fischer falling in love with Mr. Larkin and he with her. The ending scene in the shop is absolutely superb. You can really feel the chemistry between the two (and boy, does Judy Garland know how to make breathing convey emotion!). It was also very entertaining to see scenes and lines taken directly from the original, sometimes interpreted differently and sometimes exactly the same. I did think the movie focused a tiny bit too much on showboating Judy Garland's singing abilities. If the first number at the engagement party seemed slightly out of place, the second was entirely superfluous. However, I think my only real complaint about the movie is it's very uninspired title. It's based off a very short song sung at the beginning of the story and with most of the action taking place around Christmas, it just doesn't fit.",1331251200,,1666,4.609427609427609

If you haven't watched this yet and are just reading reviews...Have you seen the Tom Hanks movie, You've Got Mail? Well, it basically came from this (which came from another story...). This, however, is a great musical.(:

Like many people, I mostly knew Judy Garland from the Wizard of Oz. Seeing her in this, however, made me a pretty big fan of her. It really showcases her voice and acting talent!

Van Johnson is just amazing this movie, as well! The duo has great chemistry!

The music in the movie is lively and fun, so be prepared to have the tunes stuck in your head for a while.

Honestly, I could go on with this and maybe try to make my review into a nice little essay, but I can sum it up here.

I would reccommend this to anyone! I really can't think of any negative comments to make about it.

389253,4,6301969081,"""In the Good Old Summertime"" is the 1949  remake of the Jimmy Stewart film ""Shop Around the Corner,"" about two penpals who work together and hate each other in real life and are buoyed by their back & forth correspondence.

""Summertime"" changed the locale to Chicago from Budapest and a music store at the beginning of the 20th century.  And it's a musical!

I must admit this is a great vehicle for Judy Garland.  Even though she was going through some difficult emotional times and was spinning on drugs and alcohol, you would not know it from the way she was singing and dancing.

None of the songs are particularly noteworthy except for ""In the Good Old Summertime"" which was a popular song way back in 1902, but also songs like ""I Don't Care"" and an accompaniment with a Barbershop Quartet.

Van Johnson is average in his acting ability here, playing a one-note lover who thinks he's clever in discovering who his penpal is, and then messing with her (Veronica).

Van Johnson's character also supports a beautiful girl who is a seasoned violinist who is applying for an internship at a major European orchestra in Vienna.  This part of the story is on the back burner in favor of Judy's song & dance acts, which is fine as far as it goes, but the scriptwriters never explain their relationship.

After one scene where she plays the violin ""borrowed"" from the shopkeeper (long story) she disappears from the story.  Quite a plot hole.  What was her relation?  Where did she go?

A further remake with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in 1998's ""You've Got Mail"" had its own charm as a romantic comedy, minus the musical.  But I digress.

Another surprise was veteran silent film actor Buster Keaton.  His work on ""The General"" was amazing.  The man is an expert at physical comedy and this is not taken advantage of in ""Summertime"" at all!  The guy's a veteran actor and is playing second bill to Van Johnson!

Overall, Judy Garland sings like a bird and all her fans should watch this film just for the music (and the end scene where we see 2 year old Liza Minelli, Judy's real-life daughter).  Recommended.",1306454400,,2102,4.611859838274933
389284,3,6301969081,"""The Shop Around the Corner"" has long been one of my favorite films.  My friends told me I needed to see ""In the Good Old Summertime"" because of its similarities, so I bought it.  Not only are they similar, the scripts are almost identical.
 ""In the Good Old Summertime"" is colorful and bright. (""The Shop Around the Corner"" is B&W.)
It's a musical, unlike its predecessor. ""...Summertime"" is missing the shop owner's tragic marriage, which is nice.  The actors are different, though both films have all star casts.
 The dialogue in ""The Shop Around the Corner"" is better, I think; and delivered with more passion and believability.  You feel their emotions.  Not so with this newer film.  The two people who work together are very calm.  You really can't feel that they don't get along but are attracted to each other.  What I DO like, though, is that both characters have more integrity in this film than they did in the earlier version. They are not the coniving people the first two were.
Some of the gaps in logic existing in the first film are repaired in this one.  Scenes make more sense moving from one to another.  I could have done without Judy Garland's burlesque song at the party.  It really had nothing to do with the plot, but was just an excuse for risque song and dance.",1298592000,,1288,4.572052401746725
389285,5,6301969081,I love that it is set in the early 1900's.  The way to communicate at that time was by letter and we interacted with people all the time.  I also like the outfits from that era.,1295049600,,177,3.888888888888889
389286,5,6301969081,"The title of this film is one of the oddest choices in motion picture history.  Except for a brief bracketing in the beginning and end of the film of a summertime setting with rousing choral renditions of the title song, most of the film takes place in the winter specifically around the Christmas season.  Film historian John Fricke in a short history of the film as a special feature on the DVD, discloses the original working title was ""The Girl from Chicago"", while rather banal and trite still would have made more sense for the final film that was released rather than ""In the Good Old Summertime""!  At any rate, I for one, tend to view it as a holiday film, I only discovered it in the last few years, but it has been added to my list of favorite Christmas films.

This is a musical reworking of an earlier MGM hit of 1940, the delightful romantic comedy ""The Shop Around the Corner"" starring the enchanting Margaret Sullavan, James Stewart, and Frank Morgan directed by the skilled Ernst Lubitsch.  The plot was of two co-workers in a leather goods shop in Budapest who detest each other, but unknowingly correspond as secret pen pals and fall in love through their letters.  Besides adding musical numbers, the main changes were shifting the locale to turn of the century Chicago, and placing the embattled coworkers in a music shop, finally it would be shot in Technicolor not black and white as the original.

For me, this was the last of the golden MGM films to showcase the lustrous young Judy Garland, who had been in evidence since her first grown up role in ""For Me and My Gal.""  She would make one final film at MGM ""Summer Stock"" the following year, but except for the exhilarating ""Get Happy"" number, she looked at least five years older than her twenty-eight years, bloated and tired looking with her hair dyed a harsh black, very matronly, totally foreign from the quicksilver charmer of earlier films.  Veronica Fisher, her character in this film resembles a slightly older version of one of her most renowned roles, Esther Smith in the classic ""Meet Me in St. Louis.""  While not quite as breathtakingly beautiful as she was in that, Garland is still quite lovely in the flattering period hairstyles and costumes, with those huge gorgeous velvet brown eyes.  She looks particularly fetching when she performs two songs at an engagement party, clad in a crimson gown with a snug bodice that leaves her smooth creamy shoulders and arms bare, very alluring and desirable, with her own unmistakable radiance.  Contrasting her performance with that of Margaret Sullavan's, she is every bit as good, two delicately shaded portrayals, with both droll and poignant moments.  The singing is of course the difference between them, but in my humble opinion, there was no other singer that acted so superbly through her songs.  Garland is the consummate actress who sings.  My favorite songs contrast her talent, there is the merrily defiant ""I Don't Care"", where she twirls around a pillar and also hops backwards on one foot in putting the number across.  Compare this to the holiday song ""Merry Christmas"" which she sings at a low point in her relationship with Van Johnson.  She brings out all the warmth and tenderness of the lyrics, but with a bittersweet tinge of melancholy.  By the way, this is an undiscovered gem, absolutely gorgeous; her rendition is almost on a par with her more famous song, ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.""

While I can pretty much take or leave Van Johnson, this is one of his better performances, playing the head clerk Andrew Larkin.  He partners Garland well, and their next to last scene together on Christmas Eve in the darkened shop after closing is expertly played by both actors, first comic and then becoming ardent.  The rest of cast, good reliable character actors give wonderful support beginning with former silent screen legend, poker faced Buster Keaton as Mr. Hickey, hapless nephew of shop owner Mr. Oberkugen, known for his physical comedy, he has a expertly executed pratfall which provokes a crisis.  The noted Hungarian actor S.Z. Sakall plays Mr. Oberkugen, with his trademark hands slapped to the face, he's always a welcome addition to any film.  As Nellie Burke, Mr. Oberkugen's fiance and assistant, Spring Byington is spirited and attractive and a sympathetic ally to both Veronica and Andrew.  Clinton Sundberg who was a usual addition to MGM musicals in the late 1940's, does quite well as Rudy Hansen the final employee at the shop, and Andy's best friend.  The only oddity is Marcia Van Dyke, a very pretty and gifted violinist who made her film debut playing Louise Parkson, she seems an unnecessary addition.  She has a pair of violin solos, but except towards the end of the movie she doesn't add to the story.  There is a famous debut at the film's conclusion, three-year-old Liza Minnelli, playing (surprise!), the daughter of Judy Garland!

MGM veteran Robert Z. Leonard directed, he was a solid middle of the road professional who usually delivered the goods, and he does here.  Albert Hackett, Frances Goodrich and Ivan Tors wrote a very entertaining adaption of the earlier Samuel Raphaelson screenplay.  Final kudos to the outstanding work by legendary cinematographer Harry Stradling, art directors Randolph Duell and C Cedric Gibbons, set decorator Edwin B. Willis and costumers Irene and Vales that add so much to the production.

A holiday spirit seems to linger around this film despite the title, which is why I chose a lyric from ""Merry Christmas"" as the title for this review.  It's just perfect for this time of year, and as such is always shown on Turner Classic Movies in December, this year both on December 17 and Christmas Eve. The only extras despite the aforementioned interesting introduction by John Fricke are trailers for ""The Shop Around the Corner"", this film and the vastly inferior 1998 remake called ""You've Got Mail"".  There was a cut song that Garland did beautifully called ""Last Night When We Were Young"" that was shown I believe in one of the last ""That's Entertainment"" movies, that unfortunately isn't included here, which is a shame.  Still, if nothing else, Judy Garland's exquisite rendition of ""Merry Christmas"" would make this film a must see, and aren't we the lucky viewers that there are still so many other delights to appreciate as well?",1291507200,3,6372,4.874884151992585

389291,4,6301969081,"A charming turn-of-the-century musical with a strong performance from Judy Garland, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME is actually a remake of an earlier MGM property (""The Shop Around the Corner"") which starred James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan as feuding workmates who are unknowlingly each other's lonely hearts pen-pal.

Veronica Fisher (Judy Garland) is the latest employee at the music shop run by Mr Oberkugen (the adorable S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall), and right from the outset she ruffles the feathers of senior sales assistant Andrew Larkin (Van Johnson).  Believing she's out to usurp his position in the store, Andrew decides to give her the cold shoulder.  But unbeknowst to Andrew, Veronica is in fact his secret pen-pal.  When he discovers her true identity, all manner of complications get in the way before Veronica learns the truth as well...

IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME was filmed during one of the most wretched periods in Judy Garland's personal life, yet miraculously there's not a single hint of her private pain on the screen.  She turns in one of her most good-humoured performances as Veronica (her first scene with Van Johnson is hilarious); and sings up a storm with period-perfect numbers like ""I Don't Care"", ""Put Your Arms Around Me, Honey"", and ""Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland"".

Sadly this movie also features the last complete on-screen role for Buster Keaton, playing Oberkugen's accident-prone nephew.  Whilst he'd later appear in a cameo role in Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" and earned a new set of fans as Chief Rotten Eagle in the ""Beach Party"" movie franchise; his screen career was starting to wind down in 1949.

Filled with lush costumes and sets in the best tradition of MGM's musicals, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME is perfect viewing for any season of the year.",1242777600,,1796,5.04054054054054

Judy Garland is the star of this movie and I am always astonished  and thankful that her insecurities and troubles off screen never seem to show up onscreen.

389321,5,6301969081,"I've admired for many years now the artistry and genius of the magnificent Garland and always thought that, even after the years of chemical abuse and ""hard knocks"", she still retained a very fine, fragile physical beauty in her face and form.  However, it always amazes me, whenever I re-view one of her Metro films, how absolutely gorgeous she was and had this sensual, quivering and almost ethereal beauty about her.  Having just watched this film, after not viewing it for quite some time, I'm struck with the same impression about her physical qualities.  Her talent and artistry never fail to amaze me, no matter how many times I've watched a particular performance, both non-musical or in song.  But damn it if she's not sexy and beautiful in this film.  She gives one of her finest performances, and one of the finest comedic performance in film of all time.  We all know and enjoy the musical numbers, especially ""Merry Christmas"", ""Put Your Arms Around Me Honey"", and the outrageous ""I Don't Care"" (which, along with ""Get Happy"" from ""Summer Stock"", would showcase the Garland to be!), and her wonderful comedic interplay with the funny and handsome Van Johnson.  However, it's the last moments in this film, when Johnson finally knows that she is in-love with him, that gets to me and I appreciate her incredible talent as if anew.  That scene has to be one of the most sensual moments in American cinema...the way he brushes her cheeks with his finger..the way he plays with the collar of her blouse....the way he pulls her close to him, kissing her in such a way that, well ,we know what's on HIS mind at that moment....and her reactions..slightly caught off-guard....hessitant...vulnerable....but then takes control and reciprocates his advances.  Can you believe all this in a 3 minutes scene in an MGM film from 1949?????  When Johnson says to take ""him"" out of his ""envelope"", I mean, talk about subtlety and double entendre , which simply does not exist in today's overtly and vulgar ""realistic""- in-our-face world.

Not one of the greatest musical films made but an absolutely entertaining, enjoyable, and sexy little flick is ""Summertime"", with a radiant and lovely Garland which makes us realize, once again, that she was simply one of the finest artists of the past century.  Enjoy!

The movie is about a girl named Veronica Fisher (Garland) and a guy named Andrew Larkin (Johnson). The two people work together in a music shop called Oberkugen's(S.Z. Sakall). They simply cannot get along. What these two don't know is secretly they are pen pals that write love letters to each other. The key thing is they never met. Judy sings some great numbers in this movie. Here are the numbers:

In the Good Old Summertime- This is sung in the beginning of the movie with Van Johnson, S.Z. Sakall, Spring Byington, Buster Keaton and a chorus.

Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland- This is one of my favorite numbers. Judy voice is sooooo romantic and beautiful. She is also playing a harp in the store while singing.

Put Your Arms Around Me Honey- Van Johnson firsts sings this and then Judy sings it in the store.

Wait 'Til the Sun Shines Nellie- A barbershop quartet sings this song at a party.

Play That Barbershop Chord- Judy sings this with the barbershop quartet at the same party. This is my favorite number!

I Don't Care- Judy also sings this at the same party.

Merry Christmas- Judy sings this on Christmas Eve in the music shop.

This movie has some extras but none of them are that special. It includes the trailers for The Shop Around the Corner, You've Got Mail and the trailer for this movie. It also has these shorts on Chicago (that's where the movie takes place). It even has an intro by John Fricke (Garland Biographer).

Of course, the outcome is predictable, so let's not go there.  Suffice it to say that ITGOS is a little gem of a musical, worth owning and cracking open once in a while.

This film is based upon an earlier James Stewart film THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER and was recently remade as YOU'VE GOT MAIL.  This new restored print is an improvement over the previous VHS release.  The picture has been cleaned up and colors look brighter and bolder than ever before, as we expect with 3-strip Technicolor, though there are still a FEW age related artifacts present, but I am forgiving enough to look beyond this.  In general, the new transfer is beautiful.  The soundtrack sounds equally as impressive and has been cleaned up very nicely for this release.

Included on the disc are trailers for this film, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, and YOU'VE GOT MAIL.  I really don't know why the latter was included here, it lends nothing whatsoever to this release, and practically everyone in the country has seen it by now.  There are no other ""extras"" to speak of.  We wish that the deleted musical number, ""Last Night When We Were Young,"" sung by Judy Garland, had been included as a bonus on this disc.  Both the footage and soundtrack for this number survive, and it was included in the Outtakes section of the fourth disc of the new That's Entertainment 4-disc boxed set, released this past October.  Why wasn't it included here?

On the whole, this is a very commendable release from Warner Home Video, but if you still have the VHS tape there's no real special reason to run out and buy the DVD.

Look for an 18 month old Liza Minnelli during the closing scenes, making her film debut.",1103155200,40,1611,4.590909090909091
389350,5,6301969081,"This film was origanally written for Frank Sinatra and June Alyson. Though Personally, though i'm a great fan of both, I am relieved that both these actors were unavailable, and the talented Van Johnson and Judy Garland were hired. Can you imagine June Alyson singing 'Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland?' I couldn't these songs seemed to be written for Judy's voice, and Judy alone. Now, Judy was going through a difficult time in life right now. Exaustion, and fatique often overtook her and she was often sick. And the director Robert Z. Leonard, often sent flowers to Judy's dressing room to make her feel wanted and appreciated. The movie starts out with Veronica fisher (Garland), a woman who is out of work, and gets a job in Mr. Operkoogan's music store. During this time she has been writing to a young man who's ad she answered in a magazine. And in the course of falling in love through mail. Through this both parties only sign their name 'a friend.' So none knows who the other is. And what she doesn't know is that her correspondent is Mr. Larkin, the sales manager in the music store, who she absolutely loathes, and Visa - Versa. Finally the two decide to meet, and by Mr. Larkin recognizes Ms. Fisher when he peeks through the resturant window where the're date was supposed to take place. Angry, and very surprised Mr. Larkin 'acts.' To the unsuspecting Ms. Fisher. I will not tell you how the story ends, and spoil this wonderful movie!

389351,5,6301969081,"This is a unique and well made movie where the background actors matter even in the songs!  It's fun to see Judy Garland and Van Johnson sing for the customers who want to hear certain sheet music in the music store.

And, really, some of the dialouge has racy undertones-as does Van Johnson's acting.....watch the whole thing-you'll see what I mean.

Judy Garland puts on an all-out show in this movie and Buster Keaton added his brand of humour to the staging of some scenes and musical numbers which make them trully delightful and edgy.

Also there are some very touching scenes involving classical violin!

Music lovers and those looking for a fun and sharp witted romance film - this is it!",1091577600,5,696,4.672131147540983
389372,3,6301969081,"Question: Has there ever been a less aptly named film than In The Good Old Summertime, which takes place almost entirely at Christmas? I can't think of one. Title aside, this is merely an OK version of the much better The Shop Around The Corner, and without the presence of the divine Judy Garland it would likely be completely forgotten . This is arguably the least interesting of Judy's later MGM films, but she is in good form and the film is a must for her fans. Most of Judy's best work was for the legendary Freed unit at MGM. This was a Joe Pasternak production, as is evident by the boring and unnecesary violin subplot. Pasternak was always trying to add ""culture"" to his films. It wasn't enough to have a good time; you needed to sit through Ave Maria or The Sabre Dance as well.  Still, when things start to get bogged down, Judy is there to sing, and all is right with the world. In all, not the worst way to spend a few hours, but I'd rather have a nice DVD of The Pirate or Easter Parade.",1081814400,10,1002,4.2460732984293195
389373,3,6301969081,"""In the Good Old Summertime"" is one of Judy Garland's finest films, made all the better for her depiction of a somewhat shrew-ish woman getting a job in a music store.  John Fricke (or at least Madame Tussaud's version of him) does a good introduction, and the film plays well in newly restored format.
But back in the 1990's, a deleted song, ""Last Night When We Were Young,"" was found and included in a laser disc set of Garland films.  Why was it not included here, on the DVD?  Judy recorded this song for Capitol records in 1956, and no less an authority than Tony Bennett said it was the greatest recording of all time.  Judy's 1949 version of the song is, albeit not as impactful as the 1956 studio version, an excellent piece of work.  But yet, it is not available on this DVD.
So, boys and girls, what you are getting on this DVD is nothing more than what you would get on the VHS videotape version (unless you feel that a trailer for the movie ""You've Got Mail"" somehow, even obsequiously, fits in to this DVD).
Go find a nice VHS copy of this film.  That's your best bet.",1081641600,5,1081,4.326732673267327
389374,4,6301969081,"""In The Good Old Summertime"" is a musical remake of ""The Shop Around The Corner"" (also available from Warner and the preferred version of this movie). In place of the obviously poignant and tender chemistry that James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan brought to the original we are given shrill ineptitude, a la the usually brilliant Judy Garland and mean spirited inclinations via the embittered Van Johnson. Really, I can't see how anyone would believe Garland and Johnson could be in love, much less have a child, by the final fade out. (Film trivia: the child in the last shot of this film is Liza Minnelli.) The remake, while short on the sprite gaiety of the original, nevertheless has its moments. Garland - although wrong for the part, is nevertheless in good voice and her songs sparkle with a vintage and professionalism that only a great artist like she could make of them in an otherwise uninspired production. In the supporting cast we have one of the cinema's great joys to watch - S.Z. Sakall, as the portly, easily flustered Mr. Oberkugen - proprietor of the music shop where both Johnson and Garland work and spar. Buster Keaton is wasted in his role.
THE TRANSFER:  Warner gives us a very clean looking DVD. Colors are somewhat dated and in spots faded, but overall the Technicolor is rich and vibrant. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract. Black levels are solid. Contrast levels tend to be just a bit too low for a picture that doesn't quite deliver as much visual punch as it should. There are no digital anomalies. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.
BOTTOM LINE: This is another film that die hard Garland fans will snatch up quickly. But one wonders why Warner chose ""In The Good Old Summertime"" over say, ""Summer Stock"" or any of the Mickey Rooney/Garland vehicles.",1081209600,2,1818,4.771428571428571
389375,5,6301969081,"I am so happy this movie is coming out on DVD on Apr. 6/04.. I have it on VHS for a long time and replay it from time to time.
But it will be nice to have the DVD version. I thought Van Johnson and Judy Garland were perfect in this movie. They both work in a music store in the early part of the century. First they were adversaries, then later began to like each other and not till near the end of the movie, do they realize they know each other better than they thought. Also, very good in the cast is the very likeable S.Z.Zakall as the owner of the music store and Spring Byington as his assistant. You will also see Buster Keaton as Zakall's son in the movie. Its a nice mixture of songs, comedy and drama. You get a few good laughs. The original movie version with same story was with James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan which is also available on DVD. But I always liked Van Johnson and Judy Garland, so prefer that version. Its one of my favorite movies, but judge for yourself.",1076630400,6,986,4.167539267015707
389376,5,6301969081,"Despite the title , this movie is really a Christmas film.  Everything  in this film seems to work.  The beautiful sets and costumes, the music, and even the falling snow. The story is not complicated ,but doesnt need to be.  This is the kind of movie that you just want to lay back and forget your troubles and just enjoy.  Of course the magic of Garland is the highlight of the film.  Although this movie is not as famous as ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" it is still a great holiday film that brings me joy every Christmas............",1076630400,12,529,4.346938775510204
389377,5,6301969081,"This is a must for Judy Garland-fans. Judy turn in a Judy Holliday-like performance of Oscar material. This is not an Arthur Freed production(she had just come home from a sanitarium after the ANNIE GET YOUR GUN dismissal), but an Joe Pasternak Production.
No wonder Judy looks relaxed, warm and confident in the film. She was  away from the Freed unit...Van Johnson is a good co-star - yeah they all are:-))))))))
Indeed, MGM`s mogul Louis B. Mayer brought in Pasternak and wondred how they made the film without a single delay on Garland`s part. ""We treated her with respect"" was the answer...
It is a good film AND SHOULD always be on TV-Christmas scheduals",1064707200,4,660,4.7894736842105265

389379,4,6301969081,"This story of two co-workers who loathe each other--and then perversely fall in love when they correspond anonymously through a lonelyhearts club--has been filmed three times, first in the 1930s as THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER with stars James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan and most recently in the 1990s as YOU'VE GOT MAIL with stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  This 1940s musical version, which sets the story in an early 1900s Chicago music shop, stars Judy Garland and Van Johnson.
Although the score is not in the least memorable, Garland is in fine voice, and although they lack any real chemistry she and Van Johnson play well together.  More appealing is a romantic subplot concerning shop owner S.Z. Sakall and his long time ladyfriend Spring Byington, who are extremely charming in their roles and quite a bit of fun to watch. Fans of Buster Keaton will also enjoy seeing him in a small cameo role, and film buffs will be delighted to see Garland's daughter Liza Minnelli make her film debut in the movie's closing moments.
Although there is a great deal to enjoy here, the plot and presentation of the film is highly conventional, and the project would have benefited from a more gifted directorial vision.  Four stars as a quality product with remarkable stars; don't expect too much and you'll enjoy it quite a bit.

389380,5,6301969081,"""In the Good Old Summertime"" featuring Van Johnson and Judy Garland is a good video for the entire family viewing. There are no immoral scenes and no improper language. For families that have members that love musicals and members that hate musicals, this story will satisfy everyone. There is some singing in it, but not enough to drive you crazy. This is not a musical where everyone in the cast breaks into spontaneous singing--any music performed is germaine to the story.
Contrary to its title, ""In the Good Old Summertime"" can be considered a Christmas film and I recommend it for holiday viewing.
For those who like modern story lines, some people say it is similar (in a vague was) like ""You've Got Mail.""
Buy, view, and enjoy a delightful film.
P.S. Buster Keaton (who played the Scarecrow in ""Wizard of Oz"")does a magnificent job in this movie.  5 starts for Buster, too.
This is a cute film and you really must pay attention to the secondary characters as well. Especially Buster Keaton.",1008201600,2,998,4.76878612716763
