3507925,5,B001CC7PLM,"This 1946 Bette Davis melodrama combines over-the-top plotting and acting  with classical music.  I saw the film in a large, beautiful theater as part of ""Noir City D.C."" an annual festival of noir film. Foster Hirsch, film scholar and author, introduced the film, which celebrates its 70th anniversary this year.  He observed that it would be difficult today to make a popular film with classical music as a theme, at least to the extent this was attempted in the 1940s and 50s.

The film features passionate acting by Bette Davis as the virtuoso pianist Christine Radcliffe. More than music, the film shows the consequences of living a lie.  Set in post WW II New York City, the film opens when Christine's long lost lover, cellist Karel Novak, comes to New York from Europe where he has survived the War.  Christine and Karel reignite their passion and quickly marry.  But in the meantime, Christine has become the mistress of the wealthy, brilliant, and egomaniacal composer Alexander Hollenius (Claude Rains) who has lavished her with an apartment, gifts, and a regal lifestyle. Christine tries through every ruse and lie to keep Karel from knowledge of the affair.  But Holleniius is determined to get his revenge and to make the couple's life miserable. Better Davis' performance is full of guile, deceit, determination, and smoldering sexuality. Hollenius, a gifted composer, is maniacal, self-centered and insanely jealous.  Karel is suspicious, jealous, but also seems to be willing to accept the situation if Christine had leveled with him from the beginning.

The story builds in emotion to a climactic, murderous conclusion and an unhappy ending.  Beautiful music and a devotion to art will not make a good life in the face of a lie.  The ravishing musical score for the film was composed by Eric Korngold, who made his own composition out of the cello concerto by Hollenius that plays a substantial part in the story.  Other music that appears in the film includes Beethoven's ""Appasionata"" piano sonata and seventh symphony, Schubert's unfinished symphony, and a Schubert piano impromptu arranged for cello.

I was glad to see this classic film which combines my passion for music and more recent interest in film noir. I was fortunate to see the film on screen at the annual D.C. Noir Film Festival.

3507963,5,B001CC7PLM,"I don't normally post movie reviews, but having just watched this one, I felt I had to leave my compliments.

My mood at the end of watching this movie is that wonderful drifting quality that one is left with following an excursion into another world.  I wouldn't say that the twists were all that surprising or that the usually reviewed qualities of acting and character development were somehow on a higher plane.  In fact, I was bored at the predictable middle part when the pigeon fumbles with the investigator.

What I enjoyed so much was the way the end was portrayed.  Yes, there's that usual sinking feeling when all seems lost.  But, instead of just forcing a sense of futility on the viewer with some depressing breakdown or struggle, we instead see calm and serene images of of birds and blue skies.  The final result comes as a slow dance that lets you ponder how it will be when you face your own final futility.  Somehow, this felt like a very unusual approach for the presentation of this kind of punch line.

It almost seems that this stylistic choice made the plot seem particularly unique, intricate, and creative.  But, I'm not sure the effect came from the plot at all. I might even be generous to claim that the plot was above average.  But, I have to say that I love the mood that the movie put me in, however the effect was achieved.

As I said, I don't normally do movie reviews.  I had expected to see hundreds of reviews, but there are only 71 at this moment.  Still, I'm not sure I can expect that anyone will read this review, so I may just be chanting into a mountain breeze.  If you have read this far, I would appreciate a comment just to know; and if you've seen it and had similar feelings, then please add your own thoughts.  Thank you.",1408838400,,1770,4.43343653250774

3507967,3,B001CC7PLM,It's okay.  There's not much of a plot.  It's also difficult watching Hugh Jackman as a manipulative character.  My advise is to save your money.,1402704000,,145,4.72

In this case, an accountant with the hum-drum job of auditing companies and no social life whatsoever is drawn into a cabal of kinky liaisons that will ultimately cost him everything. Things take forever to get started and then soon go off the rails. Ewan McGregor does a reasonable job as the accountant while Hugh Jackman is the bad guy who can make dreams come true, for a price. Both of these actors have incredible talent, but none of it is on display here. There is nothing for them to do except for a few set pieces showing Jackman as a playboy and McGregor as the nerd who discovers the pleasures of numerous women, until he meets the one he falls for, named Michelle Williams. Furthermore there are plenty of unlikely possibilities, such as switched cellphones, a passport that appears from nowhere, and a trip to Madrid to collect the cash that goes horribly wrong in a park where no one hears gunshots. Seriously? This could have been a great film if it started in the middle and ended sooner, maybe a TV episode. Instead we get nearly two hours of yawns.

The clueless guy is slow to catch on, and he is said to be smart because he notices a letter and later sees some clues, but it seems the genius deceptor is smarter as his plan unfolds.

3508004,4,B001CC7PLM,"""Deception"" (2008) is directed by Marcel Langenegger. The film is about an naive accountant, Jonathan McQuarry (Ewan McGregor), who finds himself immersed in the mysterious adult world of a sex club. This in turn leads him into a con game of which he was unprepared for. The film is a sultry, smoky, film noir that seduces the viewer just like  Jonathan is seduced. Beautifully dark views and seamless direction lead us through a maze of encounters that reveal a subtle manipulation by Jamie Getz (Hugh Jackman).

That was interesting because if you ever wondered what a marionette's grandmother looks like--now you know, courtesy of Rampling.  Charlotte on a sex date???  More like a carbon date.  And yes, something you never ever saw in any other movie--just when the hero is about to be blown away by the villain, a revenge seeking woman shoots the villain from behind.

McQuarry finds the woman of his dreams at the sex club, and soon the plot thickens as he is linked to her disappearance.  Michelle Williams plays the beautiful blonde - who he only knows as ""S"" -  he meets through the sex club.

3508020,5,B001CC7PLM,"Deception can actually be pretty deceptive itself, basically because it just sounds like another flick of lies, sex, and manipulation. Well it is, but its also a lot more. Ewen's character here is very different from what he usually plays, he always seems kind of timid and innocent in films, but especially this one. He's an accountant who acts clueless in the world of sex, and love. So what happens is he meets a man(hugh jackman) who accidently(or is it) gets his cell phone switched with Mcgregors. Well on the phone there is a list, people keep calling saying are you free tonight making him feel a little odd. But as you would expect the numbers have been given to him on purpose, its a sex club. After a bit of trepidation he finally decides why not, and has sex with about ohh 10 women or so. As you may have guessed there is one in particular he saw before, and of course he falls for her. This is where i will stop and just say watch it for yourself, it gets very interesting after about the first 35 minutes or so. The performances are great, the sex it greater, and by the end of the movie your left thinking wow, i really didn't think this movie would be that great. You don't really turn your head for a second or want to get up without pausing because you may be left in the dark. So this is definitely one of those underrated films that won't, or didn't get proper recognition, so get it, enjoy it. I sure did. Ewen Mcgregor is a stellar performer, and this movie keeps him going strong.",1282435200,,1504,4.336879432624113

3508022,4,B001CC7PLM,"DECEPTION (2008) is one of those films that fares better after the brouhaha surrounding its release has dies down: catching for free on television probably adds to the positive response if the viewer has never even heard of the film!  So, in that vein, DECEPTION is a smooth thriller populated by a fine cast of actors who manage to keep the audience with them as the various aspects of this maze of a film at first confuse and then satisfy.  Writer Mark Bomback impresses and director Marcel Langenegger shows promise, but it is the work of the three main characters, with some VERY strong support form fine actors in cameo roles, that makes this thriller tick.

Jonathan McQuarry (Ewan McGregor) is an accountant whose world needs to be precisely organized - and boring - and excludes any form of diversion or unexpected excitement.  Until handsome and debonair 'lawyer' Wyatt Bose (Hugh Jackman) appears on the scene.  The two strike up a strange 'guy-thing' relationship: Bose introduces McQuarry to tokes and women and then accidentally exchanges cellphones with the spaced out McQuarry.  Probably for the first time in his life McQuarry notices a young lady (Michelle Williams) in the subway and without an exchange of more than a few words of direction he becomes obsessed with her.  Meanwhile  Bose is off to London, leaving McQuarry to discover the cellphone connection to a sex club: call a number, ask if they are busy, meet them,  and have a wholly anonymous liaison - following the strict rules of the club.  McQuarry responds to some of these calls and discovers a world that includes such beauties as Charlotte Rampling, Natasha Henstridge, Paz de la Huerta, Maggie Q...and incidentally, 'S' - the moniker assumed by Michelle Williams.  McQuarry and 'S' connect on a higher level and it is at this point that Bose returns and the deceptive scheme for 'altering auditor books' to shift millions to Bose is presented to McQuarry as the only way he will see 'S' again.  From then on nothing is as it seems, entanglements become knots, bad things happen, and the only saving grace is the manner the film ends just shy of the happy-wappy manner....until the final frames betray the taste of the movie.

DECEPTION is not a great film, but it is a good diversion as a thriller that keeps you thinking.  McGregor, Jackman, Williams et al (especially a cameo detective performance by Lisa Gay Hamilton) give fine performances - and that alone is refreshing enough to stay with the movie to the end.

Along with an interesting supporting performance from Michelle Williams, the combination of McGregor and Jackman really carry the film and distract enough from the plot-holes.  McGregor absolutely nails the nerd role, and Jackman is completely shocking and sinister as antagonist.

3508039,3,B001CC7PLM,"Going into this I had fair warning as to what it was about. The name guarantees as much. That said my interest raised as each chapter unfolded. Knowing how the genre is, working out the inevitable twists and curve balls ensued. That is part of the experience. So is the outlandish nature of plot, and I don't know a soul who thought 'Body Double' was based on anything remotely possible, but they still enjoyed it. This film has something different about it. A subtle expression that grows into an intriguing smile.

Director Marcel Langenegger worked with writer, Mark Bomback, to make the film work for both their tastes and sensibilities. Their collaboration is for the good of the project. He also brought in Dante Spinotti, a fine Director of Photography. He was largely responsible for the look of the Chinatown sequence and it was my favorite sequence of events.

I wanted to see `Deception' on the strength of Hugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor's involvement with the film. Both are extraordinarily fine actors and I could not imagine either appearing in anything sub-par. They took on assignments that cast them in a different light than most are used to viewing them in.

Mr. Jackman dives into his role with the same gusto he has become famous for. I feel that few actors can match his range. His `Wolverine' is much more than a raging mutant. Jackman squarely lifted the `X-Men' gambit to his shoulders and skyrocketed into mega-franchise orbit. He also has history on Broadway and lit the boards afire in `The Boy From Oz'. His turn as 'Van Helsing' the great vampire hunter sees Hugh in the action-adventure region and earning high praise.

Mr. McGregor plays an accountant who goes through his daily paces as one of the army of eternal extras who drift through the scenes of New York's rich, powerful, and flamboyant theater of the absurd. McGregor's skill is on display as a timid, almost apologetic excuse of a being that I would have loved to seen introduced ala `Twilight Zone' by Rod Serling. His character certainly passes through it.

What gives `Deception' its edge is an outstanding performance by Michelle Williams. Her interaction with both stars is intense, but in particular, with McGregor she is magical. Ms. Williams says more with a glance than words could express. Each scene finds her generously sprinkling talent in all directions. Oh, she does indeed speak, and I savored every word.

A quick nod to Charlotte Rampling who I might well have wrote the above paragraph for had she been given more screen time. She makes ample use of what time she does receive. Ms. Rampling has a rather brutal, but matter-of-fact way of taking over a scene. Her dominance is simply never in question.

The sliding scale for a psychological thriller begins with `Hitchcock brilliant' and works its way down from there. `Deception' is definitely north of its genres norm, and a decent companion on one of those nights when the phone is not ringing.",1246406400,,2959,4.847524752475247
3508040,3,B001CC7PLM,"Deception is suspenseful thriller easily labeled as a modern Noir film that plays with the well known opposite worlds. One of them is a shy counter, whose presence is meaningless before the feminine universe who casually meets with a seductive lawyer who likes to play hard in all the contours. Gradually this luxurious world will engage our good kid and without realizing himself, he will fall into a sophisticated plan of murder and extortion.

Along the nineties, there were three well reminded films that approached around this dichotomy: ""The Indian runner"", ""Bad influence"" and ""Fight club""

Ewan Mc Gregor steals the show like the scared executive who reacts naturally before the blackmail. Hugh Jackman looks overacted at moments and Michelle Williams fits adequately for this role, but even the brief cameo of Charlotte Rampling ignites the screen during those six minutes.

Mix all of these maxims together and you get this film. Add first-rate acting by the entire cast and you get solid entertainment.

Ewan McGregor plays Jonathan McQuarry, a painfully shy auditor who works major corporate accounts. Wyatt Bose (Hugh Jackman) meets the super lonely auditor and quickly becomes his best (only?) friend. Bose gives McQuarry access to a sex club that seems to be, well, too good to be true. Michelle Williams is the enigmatic ""S"" who captures the shy man's heart. Everything goes just smashingly until the other shoe drops. And, of course, other shoes always drop.

I don't want to give anything away. The suspense starts early on and continues until the final frame. Others have attacked this film for being too cliched or formulaic.

1. Enter an accountant (McGregor) who is a bit prudish. He meets a guy who works in the office that he is in the process of auditing. The auditor does not have much sexual experience.

2. The auditor accidentally switches phones with the Bad Guy and finds out that he is part of a sex club. Women call him up for Booty Calls and he just meets them at the hotel. Or if he calls them, then he tells them where to meet him.

3. Through the Booty Call Club, he meets a girl that he falls in love with after an eye-popping two dates.

4. It is at this point that the Bad Guy shows is true colors by kidnapping the girl and holding her hostage in exchange for McGregor's collusion on a project that needed an inside man to steal money.

5. Through some investigation, McGregor finds out the nature of the schemes of the Bad Guy and cooperates with him to save the girl's life. Later, it turns out that she was involved in the scheme with the Bad Guy.

6. The movie ends in Spain after the Bad Guy goes to collect his money with the Bad Guy getting shot and killed and the girl going off with the dry and boring accountant (who has by now changed his hair and appearance to be a Woman Magnet).

Comments:

1. This was some of the silliest stuff that I've ever seen. Has anyone ever heard of a club with beautiful women who are just interested in sex and need someone to carry it out? For that matter: Can you imagine the difficulty in keeping something like that such a *big secret*? (It is rightly said that three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead.)

2. Can passports really be faked in a single day? And for an accountant that was as much of a prig as McGregor's character, would he really have had access to all the illegal people necessary to do that?

3. What happened to the $20 million? At the end of the movie, we were led to believe that both characters walked away without the money and left it on a park bench. Is there any mental state that would make someone do something like that? Has that ever happened before?

4. Can an accountant be as stupid as the character in this film? If anyone had an IQ as low as his, then it would be all they could do to support breathing functions-- much less function as an accountant.

5. If the Bad Guy had access to so much inside information, why did he need an accountant to make it happen? How could someone have access to that much information connecting that many people?

6. The acting was good, but this plot was just way too implausible (especially for something that was portrayed as something that could happen in real life).

This time, Ewan MacGregor is the one who is ""had,"" and Hugh Jackman is the twisted sociopath.  These are definitely ""growth roles"" for both actors, and they acquitted themselves well.  MacGregor usually plays more self-confident characters, so it must have been a stretch for him to play a ""caterpillar.""

There is no depth here...not in the plot or the characters or the direction. It is clear that the director was trying very hard to create a modern day noir, but without firm characters and a believable plot (we won't even go into how implausible this is), all the smoldering stares, the pretty lighting and the nerdy accountant who meets incredibly appealing (verging on homoerotic in the first 20 minutes) con artist, come off incredibly flat and uninteresting.

3508059,2,B001CC7PLM,"Perhaps I am not the only one who thinks any films with such names as Hugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor is always worth seeing. Moreover, one notable thing about ""Deception"" is that the film is co-produced by Hugh Jackman himself. You can see why he was attracted to the role he plays in this film - here Hugh Jackman plays a type of character he is not usually associated with - but I still don't see what part of the film's generic script he found so attractive.

A meek accountant Jonathan (Ewan McGregor) meets a smooth-talking lawyer named Wyatt (Hugh Jackman) in New York City. They soon become friends, but while Wyatt is away from the city, Jonathan is accidentally introduced to a mysterious sex club Wyatt is a member of, and Jonathan encounters a woman simply called ""S"" (Michelle Williams). Things get complicated and serious, naturally, when Jonathan falls for her and Wyatt comes back.

The premise itself is fairly intriguing. I can also forget the numerous plot holes and implausible situations (how many of us would answer the phone and go out to meet a stranger like Jonathan does?). As to the sex club, I would not be surprised if it really exists and watching the supporting players such as Natasha Henstridge, Maggie Q and Charlotte Rampling is amusing. Also, Dante Spinotti's night scene photography using Genesis digital video camera is aptly cold, capturing the atmosphere of the office Jonathan works in.

But the film is slow, the characters are flat, and most importantly, the plot is obvious.

I was forced, in a matter of speaking, to watch the movie, with the hope that I could talk later to a manager at the store who ""possessed"" the skills to void extra charges.

I tried to put my frustration aside and be an open minded viewer. The beginning of the movie was such a clich for every man's dream coming true (i.e getting lucky and have a friend who would enable him to have one night stands with pretty women, who he never met before). Thrilled by this new life and the anticipation of his next bed partner, he finds that there's only one woman (of the sex list of course) that he's interested in, and he desires to know her well before bedding her.

During the ten minutes interaction between the main character and the charming mysterious blonde, I had a drink to allow me to forget the trite predictability of the lame kisses and the fake romanticism.
But, no, just minutes before the bodily union between the two souls, a surprise takes place. Mind you, the surprise is no less lame than the fake attraction between these two very different characters. Our previous geek, now is a hero in love, on a mission to save his woman and find the truth.  This is the stuff of comic book heroes not a supposedly serious suspense movie.

By the end, I couldn't fathom why these great actors were dealing with such a poor and implausible script.

I realise from Woody Allen's SCOOP (also starring Jackman) that Hugh is really too nice of a guy to play a rogue or anything sinister.

Great performances by Ewan McGregor (geeky accountant), Hugh Jackman (smooth-talking lawyer), Charlotte Rampling (smoldering seductress)  and Michelle Williams (attractive blonde) are almost eclipsed by an unrealistic screenplay involving the intertwining of two different storylines into a forgettable psychological drama, that starts well, but then is frittered away to absolutely nothing much.

You already know pretty much what's going on just by reading the title, so I'll just add that it involves mutually agreeable short term relationships, financial finagling and ruthless rub-outs.  There are many twists, and a couple of them (or at least one in particular) are quite good.

3508076,2,B001CC7PLM,"That's about how exciting this movie was. Don't blame the actors though, they tried. In the end, Deception was the proverbial ""silk purse on a sow's ear""--the silk purse being the actors, the cinematography--the technical infrastructure of the film; the sow's ear being the script, which reminded me of so many other movies that I'd seen and also didn't like.

The storyline involves an isolated timid accountant (Ewen McGregor)and his chance--cliche'd meeting with a cool, sophisticated, and charismatic corporate lawyer (Hugh Jackman)who introduces McGregor's shy character to a world of corporate hi-rise whore-houses. After sexing a thousand call-girls in just about every yoga position imaginable, McGregor's numbed ""sexually awakened"" character comes full-circle--being a stud isn't all that he thought it would be. Involuntarily, he falls for one of his many call-girls, a limp, beautiful blonde who happens to be in cahoots with Jackman's character to blackmail McGregor into moving millions into an offshore banking account.

See, I told you that you'd seen this film before. Throughout Deception--fitting title--I anticipated that big moment--that surprise--that would ease the slow pregnant feeling growing from my stomach into the seat of my pants. When the end-credits scrolled down the screen I realized that I'd just wasted two hours of my life--two hours that I'll never see again--on a bad movie.

...If these women honestly want a man to have a real relationship with, why do they find glaring defects in the available men they meet? Either he's too young...or he doesn't make enough money or he doesn't like the right china pattern.

3508081,4,B001CC7PLM,"I enjoyed this thriller with its neo-noir look ( very evocative of Manhattan) and its excellent casting and performances. The plot is credible, even if some of the twists are probably a little too easy to project. But the buildup is tension-filled and the resolution is a tongue-in-cheek nod to the profession of the main protagonist ( certainly a made-in-accountant-heaven solution!). The most memorable scenes are the bonding moments between two unlikely friends in a world where it could be very lonely if you didn't belong! In this case, the club was a sex club, populated by successful New York financial community professionals looking for ""intimacy without the intricacy"" ( in the words of the character portrayed by Charlotte Rampling, in a cameo).

I particularly liked the excellent performances. There is the very good performance from Ewan McGregor as the low-key, fun-starved auditor who plods along from one audit job to another. He embues his characterization with the right timidity and somewhat awed regard for his new-found friend and social mentor. Hugh Jackman is equally outstanding in a dramatic shift from his usual leading-man roles, this time as a villain with a criminal agenda. He is suave, sophisticated, and self-assured but when he forces the timid Jonathan to pursue a major international fraud, he is chilling! Very credible portrayal from Jackman, who is increasingly taking on more and more varied screen roles ( his 1-2 acting punch in The Prestige and The Fountain still stuns). Perhaps it is the theatre background of both Jackman and McGregor which allows them to switch to different character roles in the movies with ease and credibility.  Michelle Williams projects the right amount of vulnerability in a role that is key to the plot.

Go get the DVD, if you missed the movie in the cinema!",1217462400,,1831,5.076411960132891
3508082,4,B001CC7PLM,"What made the movie very good viewing are the interesting character studies and the excellent portrayals by the two lead actors.  Jonathan leads a rather lonely life as a CPA who does not even develop any ties with the people on whose work he passes judgment on.  When Wyatt comes into his life and opens a new and exciting world beyond the glass towers of corporate Manhattan, he is wide-eyed and smiling to himself with his discovery.  Wyatt is all smooth-talking and self-assured, professionally and socially, while pressing a hidden agenda.  What I liked most about the movie is the phase when these two men, seemingly from two different worlds, interact and a fraternal bond seemed to have developed. As if they have suddenly become the best of friends and share intimate secrets.

The movie traces how this initial bond becomes a vehicle for committing a crime ( stealing millions from questionable sources and taking advantage of how these transactions can pass through the international payment systems without being caught immediately) and how the seemingly good friend unravels his intentions to coerce the cooperation of the mousy accountant.  The twist is how the accountant foils the villain's intention, a solution made in accountant heaven  ( with their dogma of ""check and balance""!).

The parade of attractive women adds some zest to the story but I think it is the interaction of the two characters which is the essence of the story.

Ewan McGregor is excellent as the mousy accountant and leads one to sympathize with his character easily. Hugh Jackman, in a departure from his usual heroic roles, is the antagonist in this story and he delivers the performance in a refreshing manner.  The change from his suave and likable Wyatt to someone who forcefully intimidates his friend towards committing the crime is chilling.  Hugh Jackman proves further how his acting range has become so much more varied, following his acting revelations in The Prestige and The Fountain.

I would like to see both actors in another future team-up!",1211414400,,2049,5.011799410029498
3508083,4,B001CC7PLM,"""Deception"" is to the thriller genre what a pulp detective novel is to literature: it's a guilty pleasure that satisfies, even though something better is always an option. I never believed that this story was in any way, shape, or form possible, but I certainly had fun watching it. As the title suggests, many of the characters are intentionally giving off the wrong impression, and by the time we discover their true natures, something new is revealed. This isn't to say that the film is overloaded with plot twists; the mystery eventually comes to an end with little confusion, and that's good for anyone who actually wants to follow along with the details. I will say that I was concerned entering the theater, because let's face it--a title like ""Deception"" makes one wonder just how far it will go to fool the audience.

We're immediately introduced to Jonathan McQuarry (Ewan McGregor), a timid accountant for some unnamed firm in New York City. While working late, he meets Wyatt Bose (Hugh Jackman), an extremely charismatic attorney. He instantaneously gets on McQuarry's good side, first by sharing a joint with him, second by involving him in activities he would never be a part of. They become friends, but it's obvious that something sinister is lurking behind Bose's devilish smile. McQuarry begins to discover this when the two accidentally switch cell phones during a lunch meeting--while Bose is supposedly on a London business trip, McQuarry keeps getting phone calls from women who ask if he's available, believing he's Bose. Feeling emboldened, McQuarry decides to take one of the women up on her offer and meet at a hotel.

And that's when he discovers that Bose is part of a sex club that caters to people interested in one-night stands. McQuarry eventually meets a Wall Street belle (Charlotte Rampling) who states the two basic rules: no rough stuff, and no names. In this seemingly harmless world of casual sex, McQuarry eventually meets a woman known only as S (Michelle Williams). Both are initially uncomfortable because they realize they had met before in a subway station. To alleviate the tension, they break the rules and actually strike up long-winded conversations. They also go on dinner dates from time to time. What they don't do is share their real names. However, McQuarry seems to think that a romance is developing, so it seems likely that all such missing pieces will eventually fall into place.

Then again, maybe they won't. When both stay in a Chinatown hotel, McQuarry returns to his room only to be knocked unconscious by a masked assailant, just as he notices that the bed sheets are stained with blood. He comes to hours later--not only are the bed sheets perfectly clean, S is nowhere to be found. It would seem that McQuarry has unknowingly been drawn into something much bigger than he thought, and what's worse, it has everything to do with Wyatt Bose. I won't reveal who he really is, what he plans to do, why he wants to do it, how he involves McQuarry, and what has happened to S, but rest assured that it's all about as sinister as you expect it to be, and no more. At a certain point, McQuarry accuses Bose of being a liar: ""Those weren't lies,"" Bose says maliciously. ""That was foreplay."" I can't quote the rest of that line for censorship reasons, but believe me when I say that the next bit of dialogue was oddly satisfying.

The same can be said for the movie as a whole, even if the story is less believable than Michelle William's bleach blonde hair. I found myself caught up in the suspense, the way it slowly built itself before going right to light speed at the start of the third act. McQuarry is much more resourceful at that point, which is expected not only because his life is in jeopardy, but also because he begins the film as a mousy nobody. Then again, I'm not entirely sure he changes by the end of the movie--his love for S is motivating him more than anything else, which is odd considering he little he knows about her, least of all her name. Following her so blindly just doesn't seem logical. But I don't think logic is what the filmmakers were aiming for. ""Deception"" is a good old-fashioned mystery, adhering strictly to a formula of pure entertainment; chances are you'll find the plot twists more interesting than the coherence of the story.

The same can be said for the performances, which are only as good as this film allows them to be. Jackman isn't much of a surprise here, since his role doesn't call for anything grander than being a villain. McGregor, on the other hand, reveals a refreshing new side to his personality. Being small and meek is a lot harder to pull off than being the tough guy--you need to be shy and vulnerable while making it look like you're desperate to prove something. I sensed that from his character and appreciated it, despite the fact that the story didn't always support it. But since I didn't expect anything more or less than what was delivered, I guess it's okay. I got my money's worth from ""Deception,"" and you will too as long as you're able to suspend disbelief and go with the flow. It's like being a client in an underground sex club--everyone can go home happy as long as no questions are asked.",1209081600,,5230,4.6990185387131955
