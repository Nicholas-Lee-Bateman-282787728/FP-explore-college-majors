5091585,1,B007JLBVKG,I agree with every word that Karen said. This film leaves too much out to have any entertainment value. It is too repetitious and drags along. The actors were wasted on this film.,1340150400,5,179,4.454545454545454
5091586,2,B007JLBVKG,"i can appreciate what this movie is aimed at doing, but it never got there... the movie is 90% running through the jungle while everyone rambles on incoherently... fireworks for explosions... ugh.",1339977600,,196,5.15625
5091587,1,B007JLBVKG,"If you enjoy watching movies about a group of people who run around a jungle shooting at something never seen then this movie was made for you. It has a camera crew traveling with a squad of soldiers on a mission to put in place some remote cameras that turns in an alien contact mission. As expected the soldiers have to tell the reporters to 'get down' and 'no lights' about a hundred times. The only bit about origins comes from a 40 second scene added on at the end.

All in all a waste of time and money.",1339545600,19,509,4.141414141414141
5091588,5,B007JLBVKG,rates a 5 star for  alien loving movie goers. Well done and worth the rent. Would not recommend this for the little ones just adults.,1374451200,,133,4.32

5091590,1,B007JLBVKG,"I keep telling myself I am not going to watch any more of these crappy found footage films...until the next one comes out. This one started out with some promise of great background jungle and archeological scenes. A group of Belize special forces and a civilian camera crew (they always work together so well) along with our token eye candy Julia (Chelsea Vincent) have a mission to set up cameras along the border to monitor for illegal activity. As they venture into the jungle, weird things happen and they begin a search for two missing archeologist who have discovered an odd skull, not made of crystal.

About 45 minutes into the film we have a brief encounter with what appears to be an alien spacecraft possibly under the operation of Amish acting Mennonites. Alas this was the cue to toss the camera about, create static and fuzz, and dim the lighting for the rest of the film which was an absolute bust. The Bigfoot and Frankenstein found footage films are vastly superior to this one. So if you didn't like those, save your money.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Film carries a warning for ""disturbing content"" which appears to be a hook and not an actual warning.",1367107200,2,1187,4.6746411483253585
5091591,1,B007JLBVKG,"How much did this cost to make? Like, 100 bucks? There is no script. There are no special effects. The camera work is all hand-held. The plot is non-existent. The character development is completely absent. The score is a non-entity. Consists almost entirely of Latin American soldiers creeping through the jungle in Belize in search of some lost Americans. They keep shooting at the alien, but we never see it. That's because there was no budget for special effects. All the dialogue consists of guys shouting, ""Go! Go! Go!""...or for variety, ""Move! Move! Move!"" The shaky camera will give you a headache. This went out of style with ""The Blair Witch Project"" about 20 years ago. Looks like a bad film student production.",1351123200,,722,4.878048780487805
5091592,3,B007JLBVKG,"If you're wondering who actually watches and enjoys all of these ""found footage"" films - well, that would be me.  I freaking love ""found footage"" movies, even the bad ones - especially the bad ones from The Asylum.  With so much to make fun of, how can you not enjoy yourself?  Alien Origin is an especially bad treat.  Almost nothing actually happens, and when something does happen, you aren't permitted to actually see any of it.  Don't expect to see any aliens here, as the camera conveniently messes up whenever a possible alien pops up.  As an added bonus, though, the filmmakers throw in some found footage inside the found footage that is the movie.  I'm talking found footage squared here, people.  In all honesty, I can understand why some people are actually calling this the worst film from The Asylum in years.  Of course, as far as I'm concerned, that is exactly what makes Alien Origin such a hoot to watch.

The footage making up this film comes from a squad of Belize special forces sent out into the jungle to perform the dangerous job of nailing some cameras up along some river that has possibly been the site of some activity (probably drugs, but who knows?).  Along for the thrilling ride (or should I say hike) are ""adventure journalist"" Julia Evans (Chelsea Vincent) and her film crew.  You have to love these Belize special forces.  They go into these jungles with fingers on the triggers, constantly sweeping the area like they're expecting Predator to jump out on them at any minute.  And those hand motions.  These guys throw out more signs than a gang member on crack.  Having no military background, I don't know if any of the hand motions they use are actually legitimate, but I strongly suspect that they're just making them up as they go along.  Moving forward, the mission gets changed to a search mission for two archaeologists who have gone missing from a dig site.  That's when the fun really begins, because these missing scientists have found something that was better left unfound.  What is it?  Only the movie description will tell you.

The vast majority of this film consists of these guys making their way through the jungle.  Eventually, they encounter something dangerous (probably an alien) that growls and flings bottle rockets at them, and they try to escape back through the same jungle.  By and large, that's pretty much the whole movie.  Obviously, this is only going to appeal to bad movie junkies like myself - and quite frankly, I had a pretty good time watching this.  Where else are you going to see an archaeologist make the discovery of a lifetime and simply pick it up and throw it in a canvas bag?  Who else is going to make a movie about aliens and then refuse to show you any aliens?  Where else are you going to hear a native of Belize refer to someone as a ""wanker?""  Where else could you find a seasoned special forces soldier jerk and fall down dead from the effects of a bottle rocket that didn't land anywhere near him?  And what other film company is going to have a character continually call out the name of someone who isn't even in the film - and never explain or apparently even notice the mistake?  This is why I love The Asylum - they've taken the art of bad movie making to a level never before imagined.  Don't misinterpret my rating - clearly, this is a one-star movie for the vast majority of the population, but for us wackos who can't get enough of the worst films ever made, Alien Origin is heaps of fun.",1345420800,9,3488,4.577419354838709
5091593,3,B007JLBVKG,"Good movie but all of it appears to be from a pre-written script.  Writer over looked small items that give it away.

-All males were clean shaven even though they were supposed to be in the forest for 3 days.
-No scattered or running blood from wounds.
-End of movie has discussion indicating the alien DNA was part human.  They had been in the forest for at least three days,
 how and where did they get the DNA and how did they get it analyzed?
-At the beginning of movie a white american male is part of a south american army.  Doesn't add up.  Also this male has a
 beard.  Militaries don't allow beards (with the exception of the navy)
-While running away from alien, group stops to make a wooden booby trap. The ends of the large tree limbs were so evenly cut
 that it appeared to have been cut with a power saw.
-Even though group was running for their lives, the camera man was in front of the soldiers filming the soldiers running in
 his direction.

Good directing and acting.  It should have been promoted as sci fi fiction, probably would have had more viewers.",1345334400,,1074,4.3686868686868685
5091594,3,B007JLBVKG,"from the mad mind of MARK ATKINS.

Kind of a cool `Predator homage' in the found footage genre of Faux-Docs.

There is real suspense in capture scenes and female lead comes off as a honest person wanting knowledge for her documentary.

Some of the camera work is new,Atkins is known more as a Director-Of-Photography for most of ASYLUM films and he always films out of country .

GREAT poster too.",1343174400,,397,4.628571428571429

5091596,1,B007JLBVKG,"I would really like to know how movies like this get funding, but I guess when it appears they only spent a couple thousand dollars making it I understand. It's really amazing how you can create so much action by just moving and shaking the camera around. It's really sad that one must watch so 10 movies just to see one that was worth watching.",1342137600,,345,4.323076923076923

8518361,1,B007JLBVKG,I very rarely write reviews on the items I purchase but I thought I'd add my two cents on this one. It is extremely rare that I find fault with a movie though I have seen some pretty bad reviews for movies that I liked. I have bought some of The Asylum's movies in the past and thought they were pretty good. Until this one. To begin with I didn't care for the films style. It was too reminiscent of the Blair Witch films (which I thought were pretty bad.). On top of that I found myself loosing interest in what was happening half way through the film. I will try to watch the movie again and give it another chance. Hopefully I'll make it all the way through this time lol.,1505433600,,675,4.121212121212121
8518362,1,B007JLBVKG,"I usually have something positive to say about a movie no matter how bad it is. I can't with this movie. First and foremost, which I could live with, but not with the rest of it, the acting was terrible. Next, ****Spoilers Ahead**** Like anyone is going to care about spoilers with a movie this bad, anyway you see the movie through the view of a cameraman who is filming the entire expedition into the jungle for what appears to be a newscast/show. So, lots of shaky camera, I don't know about you, but I hate that. Next, most of the film the first 55 minutes out of 128 minutes is just the Belize army soldiers and these reporters trekking through a jungle, nothing else happens with the exception of them finding a boat hundreds of miles from where it should be and three cameras being knocked off of trees leaving behind strange claw marks. That is the only action for the first 55 minutes. After that they encounter something, it is never made clear what it might be until the very end where they give you an allusion to the origin of who their attackers might be but, nothing ever definitive. I won't tell you that, but all you see are a ship briefly, and then they enter a ship/sewer/water plant I was not sure and things get a little wilder from there, where they are attacked and shot at, but you never see the attackers. At no point do you ever see any actual attackers other than possibly a drone for a few seconds and lots of explosions shot from who knows where. I unfortunately sat through the whole thing. The good news is, I got it on Blu-Ray for only $0.60, or 60 cents. So, it's not much of a loss. For a Blu-Ray, there is no Trailer for this particular movie, though there are for other movies by Asylum, and there are no subtitles. Had I known how bad it would be, would I have purchased it, NO, not worth the 60 cents I paid for it.

8518365,1,B007JLBVKG,"While checking out Netflix I stumbled across this flick, figured why not give it a try? Well as far as found footage movies go.... this was one of them. Some military guys, a journalist and her camera guy go on some routine mission to place cameras in the Belize Jungles to catch illegal activity. So naturally this leads to them finding way more than the ever thought possible, not that any of it is particularly interesting, in fact a good chunk of it is rather boring with a lot of pointless sneaking around and jerkiness with the camera. Granted once things do finally happen it's not any more interesting and if you're like me you'll be checking your watch or phone to see when this is over. The only good thing about the movie is the conclusion, mainly cause it means this borefest is over.",1413590400,,796,4.496551724137931

The whole thing is poorly directed, horribly acted and the filming gave me a headache. And where was the climax? Buggered if I know. I think this was made on about a 500 dollar budget. However, look at what they did with Blair Witch with a low budget and then look at this junk. They should have paid me to watch it.",1399507200,,481,4.073684210526316
