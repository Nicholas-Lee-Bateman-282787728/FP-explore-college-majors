2796333,2,B000OIOPR2,Not real in to this book. There is a lot of art in it which tends to be hard to read. I would think a child would have a hard time reading it because words are everywhere.  Just not much to say about it except I don't like it.,1231545600,,226,3.6122448979591835
2796334,5,B000OIOPR2,I've used this book in the class from 1st grade thru 4th -- they all love it and there are lots of extension activities that can be added.,1221350400,,138,3.9642857142857144
2796335,5,B000OIOPR2,"If you don't have any Laurie Keller books in your collection, you are missing out because all of her books are clever, witty and quirky.  And now that Arnie is on DVD...he has become a star.  You and your children will LOVE Arnie!!",1188691200,,231,4.348837209302325
2796336,5,B000OIOPR2,"The video is done very well. Much better than a standard book that just shows static images with a voice-over text. There is some animated movement and all the comic asides are presented.  My daughter and I have read this book so many times that we were able to quote along with the movie the first time we saw it.
The other videos on the disc are OK. The real winner here is Arnie the Doughnut.",1185062400,6,395,4.197368421052632

8185113,5,B000OIOPR2,Such a fun story with a great sense of humor. We have read it many times and always find new details.,1392422400,,101,3.857142857142857
8185114,5,B000OIOPR2,"This video, which brings to life the book of the same name, is so funny and original. Adults will love it nearly as much as the kids do. I have never even watched the other stories on the DVD (sorry, authors), but Arnie alone makes it totally worthwhile. This animated picture book is targeted toward kids aged 4-8, but will appeal to a wider audience. Don't hesitate to buy this one (assuming the price is not inflated).",1382313600,,421,4.48051948051948
8185115,5,B000OIOPR2,Great stories - well told.  Particularly love Roberto the Insect Architect - inspiring for kids who want to follow a dream.,1381795200,,123,4.857142857142857
8185116,5,B000OIOPR2,My children love Arnie the confused doughnut.  Arnie is a doughnut who goes through a journey of self discovery and later survives being eaten by becoming a dog.  Arnie is both silly and lovable.  Great cartoon short.,1361923200,,217,4.8108108108108105
8185117,5,B000OIOPR2,"My son first saw ""Arnie The Doughnut"" in school. He enjoyed it so much he bugged us for weeks to get the DVD. We're glad we did. Good message for children.",1353024000,,155,4.032258064516129
8185118,5,B000OIOPR2,"This video is a perfect compliment to the book.  I read the book to my 4th grade students, then we act out the reader's theater (in doughnut costumes we design and make), and we put on a show for parents.  Then as a culminating activity, we eat doughnuts and watch this video.  It is perfect!  My students even enjoyed the 3 other short videos on the DVD.",1341705600,,355,4.253731343283582
8185119,5,B000OIOPR2,"My grandchildren loved Arnie, they had me make an arnie the doughnut stuffy with the sprinkles to look just like Arnie.  When I mailed it to my grandson he said he loved it. we read the story so many times while I was visiting them. The movie is just like the book. We have enjoyed it.",1331856000,,285,4.089285714285714
8185120,5,B000OIOPR2,I purchased this video for my Grandson who saw it at Kaleidoscope in Kansas City. He fell in love with it. Great story and the donuts talks!,1265500800,,140,4.222222222222222
