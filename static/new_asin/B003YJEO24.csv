4229576,5,B003YJEO24,"I began doing this series on Time Warner on Demand. It is one of the best workouts I have ever bought. It's a circut training series, so your heart will really get pumping. The lower body workout it one of my favorites. It's nothing but squats and lunges, your legs are shaking and burning before you finish the reps, but IT WORKS. On top of all that, the longest workout is only about 24 min. The most equipment you'll need it a set of hand weights, and a mat (if you wants) for the yoga workout.",1287619200,7,497,4.1875
4229577,2,B003YJEO24,"This is my second try at this video, both have had the same problems.  You can only play all, which is over 100 minutes of exercise. It wouldn't allow me to pick just one of the 5 workouts.  The video quality is also terrible.  The picture is jumpy so you can't stand to watch it for very long.

This is such a shame because the workout is really good.  I tried these workouts through exercise tv, free on demand (AT&T).  I'm in pretty good shape, after each workout your heart is pumping and you are sweating.  I usually did two workouts a day for around 45 minutes of exercise.  I felt a little sore and tired, but wow what a great workout.

If they fix the video quality issues, this is a great workout to add to anyone's routine.",1287532800,17,733,4.215827338129497
4229578,4,B003YJEO24,"Every one of these 20 minute chapters (except the Yoga) is a circuit workout that alternates cardio & weights. It gets a lot done in a short time. I'm a big fan of Chris, she is so pleasant and knowledgable to work out with. I really like these workouts but had to modify it to my needs. For example, while doing bent-over flies, she mentions how challenging the 2 lb weights are. Well, I have been lifting weights for over 25 years and I have to use 12 to 15 lbs there. Basically, if you go as heavy as you can handle this is a fantastic workout.

Now to the technical part: the DVD is chaptered but doesn't let you select one at a time. The only option that works is 'Play All', however, it lets me skip forward to get from one chapter to the next, so if I only want to do the last two workouts for example, I have to skip through a few times to get there which works ok, but is definitely a flaw considering the price of this DVD. I bought it from Amazon and not Exercise TV which is now out of business (as of Feb 2012 - I'm editing my original review).
Additionally, there is now a follow-up set out by Chris: 10 Pound Slimdown Xtreme which consists of 3 DVDs, one with 40 minute workouts (xtreme), one with 20 minute workouts (recovery) and one with 10 minute workouts (bonus). This set is very expensive and is currently only sold by QVC. The workouts are great but I want to give you a ""heads-up"" on a couple of things: the 20 minute recovery workouts are the exact same ones as on this orignal Slimdown DVD. I think this is deceiving and I felt ripped off. Second, the packaging is cardboard and there is a good chance you get them scratched and scuffed. As a result some of the chapters froze up and jumped back to the main menu in the middle of the workout. Cleaning the disc didn't help either. Aside from that, all DVDs were chaptered and let me select each workout individually. But I definitely wanted to mention that one of the DVDs is the same as this one.",1286150400,16,1973,4.205804749340369
4229579,5,B003YJEO24,"As I got towards my target weight on my weight loss journey (I've lost over 25 pounds so far), I found the weight loss slowing down. Part of that was that my metabolism was slowing down. While I was burning fat during my cardio workouts I was also often losing muscle. That, combined with the fact that your base metabolic rate slows the lower your weight, made it even harder to lose those last ten pounds. I'm so happy that I found Chris's program. I knew that adding real strength training to my workout was what I needed to rebuild muscle and increase my metabolism to make losing those last ten pounds easier. Chris's workouts focus on one part of the body, not because she wants you to believe you can target sculpt any area, but by doing so you can strength training 5 or 6 days a week and still allow your muscles to rest. For example, if you focus on your lower body on Monday, you can do upper body the next day and still give your lower body the rest it needs. So far, I have lost 4 more pounds over the first three weeks of her program. It has certainly helped me reboot my weight loss. I combine Chris's workout with everyday cardio such as light running, walking, hiking, tennis, or whatever fits on any given day. Also, be sure to use use heavy enough weights. I'm up to using 8 lbs weights on the upper body and 5 lbs on her total body workouts, but started with 5 lbs and 3 lbs. It's important to fatigue your muscles. Other exercise DVDs where we are told to only use 3 lbs weights won't build much muscle in the long term. If you want a good program to do at home and want to avoid the high cost of a gym membership, this is a great one to check out.",1283040000,52,1669,4.170278637770898
4229580,5,B003YJEO24,"Honestly, this workout plan has everything you need! It's got cardio, strength and toning and the workout plan on ExerciseTV helps you map out what to do when.

4229595,5,B003YJEO24,I rented this the other day and was very proud that I was able to get through the entire 2 hours using 5lb weights. Today I noticed that my clothes are looser and so I look forward to repeating the exercises tomorrow. I have always worked out so I am in good shape but have found it harder to drop weight and I put this down to being close to 50 and so when I noticed the weight loss this morning I could not believe it! This workout is just what I need to get rid of those xmas 5lbs.  I love Chris and think she is a great instructor who is pleasant but gets down to business. There were some new exercises in there that I found challenging but I am proud of myself for mastering them. I used 5lbs because I wanted to make sure I could get through the 2 hrs using proper form and am sure I will increase my weights as I gain confidence. Chris knows her stuff and is a great looking fit woman that proves you can look wonderful at any age. So if you only have 20 minutes or you have 2hrs I highly recommend this.,1420675200,2,1012,3.9607843137254903

I think I would have liked this one as I do like her other DVD's, but am frustrated as to why it will not play - notice others have the same problem so there must be some problem that has not been fixed.

However, I'm always looking for a few good workout DVDs to do on days when I can't make it to the gym for whatever reason.

It will definitely help you get your sweat on!  I was dripping after the first time I did this work out.  (I did three of the circuits for a one hour workout.)

I just completed the 30 day workout program, which I printed at chrisfreytag.com, and I have lost a total of 9lbs and wore a bikini to the beach for the very first time. I have sculpted muscles and my daughter said, ""Mom, you have abs!"" After having 4 kids my abs were virtually non-existent before the program and now I can feel them when I workout. I should have taken measurements so I could have a more accurate idea of the inches I've lost, but my clothes fit better and I feel great.

As with any fitness routine you MUST be consistent. I found the 10 Pound Slimdown workouts to be simple yet effective and each workout is only 20 minutes. Anyone can devote just 20 minutes a day to better health.

I did purchase my DVD from Exercise TV and the quality is excellent.

I do all kinds of lower body workouts, so I was really surprised that this one kicked my butt so much. But in a good way b/c I can feel it working. LOVE the burn! And it's only about 20 minutes. I love circuit workouts. Aside from their obvious effectiveness, you know whats coming so it's not changing too too much, and if you don't love a circuit, you know it won't last much longer so you can push through it!

Full body blast is great when you need an allover workout or when you need a recovery day from a muscle group. I tend to work out my butt and legs a lot so full body blast is a good one for getting the heart rate up and staying active while allowing those areas to recover a little.

Chris can really push you with motivation to try harder than you think possible. I feel stronger mentally and physically and hate taking a day off.

I would grab one of these before they are no longer sold.  I used this mostly because my regular routine at the gym wasn't giving me the class room training options.  This program uses circuit training methods which I find are the best for keeping my energy level up throughout the duration of the program.  I often would try something new on demand after gaining more energy after one of these programs or I would double up and do two of the programs back to back.  I definitely see results.  I lost a paints size, and it is so nice to know I always have this dvd to keep me motivated.  I just grabbed another Chris Freytag dvd I saw on sale for $2 in job lot.  I would buy any of her dvds.

I fell in love with it instantly because the one I saw was the 10 Pound Slimdown Xtreme. Her workouts seem effective and even though you may be doing a workout for a specific area, you really get a good body workout because she makes you use all of your muscles. I got it the other day and I have no issue's with the quality of the dvd. For anyone serious about losing weight and toning your body I would def recommend this to anyone ,the workouts are not that hard to do.",1324252800,,573,4.125
4229736,5,B003YJEO24,"I started doing the 10 Pound Slimdown through my AT&T On-Demand for free and when they stopped offering it I purchased this video without hesitation.  I am a part-time fitness instructor myself and I find that Chris Freytag is an extremely effective instructor who is positive and inspiring without being too bubbly or annoying. She gives clear instructions with enough advanced notice that you can keep up with the changes to the moves in the routines.  She also provides basic and advanced options for many of the moves so the less advanced person is not completely demotivated.

I am also a working mother of two (ages 2 and 4) so my time is very limited. The workouts are short enough at 20 minutes each that I can get at least one in before being disrupted.  They are intense enough that I don't feel like I am letting myself off of the hook by only working out for 20 minutes.  The workouts combine cardio to maximize the calorie burn with weight-training combination moves to maximize muscle burn.  It's helpful that Exercise TV also offers a suggested schedule (available on their website)to follow which allows you to alternate workouts that focus on different muscle groups each day so you can work out 5-6 days a week without overdoing it.  Workouts include a Total Body Blast, Upper Body, Lower Body, Core and Yoga.  My favorites are the Total Body Blast and Core.  I am generally not a fan of Yoga as it's too slow-moving, but this 20 minute intense Yoga holds my interest.

Chris Freytag also offers the 10 Pound Slimdown Extreme workouts and they are amazing too, but I do not think they are available on Amazon, just Exercise TV. They are basically the same format as the 20 minute videos, but last 40 minutes.  The one great addition to the Extreme workouts that I wish the basic workouts had is a 40 minute Cardio Kickboxing workout. Many of these Extreme workouts are currently available to me through AT&T U-Verse On-Demand though, so I have not yet purchased them.

I would highly recommend the 10 Pound Slimdown videos for anyone who is at least at a moderate fitness level and wants a great option for taking off 5-10 unwanted pounds. For less than $20, the DVD is a really good value to get such a verstatile set of workouts.",1322438400,6,2249,4.63727959697733
4229737,5,B003YJEO24,"Chris Freytag always has great workouts.  This one is no different.  It is easy to follow, and Chris is encouraging without being obnoxious.  There are quite a few options for workouts - you can do total body, upper body, lower body, core and yoga.  This is a great option for me when I cannot make it to the gym.  I tend to mix them up.  The only con is that you cannot chose a mix before starting your workout, but by using the menu it is easy enough to skip around.",1319760000,,468,4.087912087912088
4229738,5,B003YJEO24,"This is the best 5 episode program I have ever done. It works everything and fast. All you need to do is just do it, one every day! Builds strength and loses weight. Love it.",1319328000,,174,4.0
4229739,5,B003YJEO24,I recently added this DVD to my collection.  I enjoy exercising with Chris Freytag because she's very thorough and explains (and reminds you) the correct movements so you don't injure yourself.  I like combining two workouts together for a complete total body workout.  You really feel the workout the next day...in a good pain way!  ;)  You just can't go wrong with Chris Freytag!,1316044800,,381,4.890625
4229740,5,B003YJEO24,"Chris Freytag is encouraging without being cheesy.  She sets a good pace which is rigorous and attainable.  My daughters (ages 22, 18, 15) do this workout with me.  Our favorite is the yoga routine.  It gets you to sweat and stretch and isn't too long--all the workouts are about 22 minutes which makes them doable in busy lives.  My arms and upper body are already getting stronger!",1315267200,,383,4.656716417910448
4229741,5,B003YJEO24,"I tried the 10lb Slimdown Yoga on On Demand through Comcast before purchasing this workout DVD. I've tried many different yoga workouts and I couldn't find one that was a medium pace that I could follow and feel good about doing. I found Chris Freytag and I love her! She is a great instructor. Don't let her fool you though, she'll have you sweating by the end of this yoga routine! :-)",1314316800,,387,4.388888888888889
4229742,5,B003YJEO24,"This video more than meats my expectations. I love the 20 min segments, they are over before you know it. Easy to follow workout and low impact options. The monthly free download was a great bonus. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a great at home workout.",1313107200,,272,4.46
4229743,5,B003YJEO24,"I really like this workout because I love to strength train. This DVD allows me to strength train every day without over training any muscles. At the same time, nothing is neglected. If you go on exercise tv's website and click on the link to this program, there is a free pdf download that gives you a full 30 day program, so you know which days to do which segment. Some days you do one, and some days you do two. I recommend this video because it is so well rounded that you can return to it again and again.",1312848000,2,511,4.12
4229744,5,B003YJEO24,I use this DVD alot. I like rotating the workout circuits depending on the day. I like Chris Freitag. Low impact or high impact versions of the circuits. Very easy to get started.,1306972800,,179,4.454545454545454
4229745,5,B003YJEO24,"I initially didn't buy this workout due to bad reviews about the video quality (& because I was able to access it for free On Demand from FitnessTV even though it was not in the room I prefer to work out in).  Then, they began removing the workouts from FitnessTV & I decided to go ahead & order it.  I was more than happy with the video quality when I received it & there is a main menu that you can use to choose which workout you want (I have lost the remote to the TV in my workout area & still can skip through the ""chapters"" easily to select which one I want).  My only disappointment when switching to the DVD is that there is no longer the countdown timer in the top left corner of the screen as there was on FitnessTV - not a big deal, but it always helped me to see how long I had left to go!

The workouts are challenging, but doable.  I usually do some cardio on the elliptical before I start one of these workouts.  I'm not in fantastic shape, but I can make it through these workouts & break a serious sweat doing it.  It is definitely a struggle to make it through two of them after the elliptical (if you follow the schedule on FitnessTV).  Chris Freytag is not overly-peppy or otherwise annoying, but gives just the right amount of motivation to keep going.",1305504000,10,1274,4.171428571428572
4229746,1,B003YJEO24,I have ordered two of these DVD's and neither of them worked. It is such a great workout program which is why I am so disappointed that a decent working DVD cannot be found.,1305504000,3,173,4.117647058823529
4229747,5,B003YJEO24,"I almost didn't buy this DVD based on the bad reviews about the production quality. That would have been a mistake. I play the DVD in my laptop, and I can choose which workouts to do and the video quality is fine. Love this DVD! The price is a little more than what I normally like to pay, but still worth the money. Freytag is one of my favorite instructors, because she's peppy without being annoying, she gives good cuing, and her workouts leave me sweating but are still do-able for a 41 year-old. The workouts are 20 minutes long, but you can visit the Exercise TV website and download and print off a workout schedule. Twice a week, two workouts are listed. For three days, only one 20 minute work out per day. And, rest for two days. The website also has an eating guide.",1304380800,5,778,4.335616438356165
4229748,5,B003YJEO24,"I first did the yoga routine when it was ondemand on Comcast, i really enjoyed it but then they stopped having it for free on there, so I ordered the DVD! There are about 5 workout routines that are 20 minutes long each, but I haven't tried any of the other routines except yoga but I bet they would all really help to tone your body. Plus you can download a free monthly workout routine that will help you slim down! I recommend this DVD, especially if you are looking for short workout bursts that are really effective.",1301788800,,521,4.326530612244898
4229749,5,B003YJEO24,"I was concerned about other customers reviews of the poor video quality so I bought the slightly more expensive video direct from the ExerciseTV Store [...].  There is no problem with the video quality and each workout is its own chapter that you can select without having to fast-forward.

I highly recommend Chris Freytag's workouts.  They are convenient, only 20 or so minutes each, and give you the option to challenge yourself. I followed Chris' 30 day workout plan and am already seeing results throughout my entire body, especially my mid-section.  My friends and family are also noticing! Chris is positive and encouraging without being annoying. I never thought I would enjoy working out in the comfort of my own home so much, but after seeing results in only 30 days I am completely hooked.",1298246400,56,800,4.9037037037037035
4229750,5,B003YJEO24,"I am very fond of Chris Freytag workout dvds, I have all of them. You really work hard with her and get fantastic results, you can combine the workouts however you want. I am looking forward another workout.",1291248000,,207,4.473684210526316
4229751,3,B003YJEO24,"I absolutely love the dvd it is awesome and so practical! It is a great workout and I would highly recommend it. But the reason I gave it only 3 stars is because it is not a high quality recording. It is jumpy and not smooth running between exercises. I was very disappointed with this aspect of it, but Chris is great as usual and the exercises very beneficial.  I have many of her dvd's but never from ""Exercise TV"" and I took a chance on this one, but it is not the same quality as her others.",1289779200,9,496,4.061224489795919
4229752,1,B003YJEO24,"I have 6 or 7 of Prevention/Chris Freytag DVD's and like all of them.  She is an excellent instructor---motivating without being cutesy, easy to follow, always a great workout.

This DVD is a mess---the video quality is so poor, I can't believe the company issued this DVD and that Amazon sells it.  I watched for about 10 minutes and was dizzy.  The DVD is constantly going out of focus and every minute or so there is a flash of light.  At first I thought there was a thunderstorm outside, but the weather was calm.  I switched TV's and DVD players, but got the same result.

I will be returning it.",1288742400,13,601,4.409090909090909
4229753,2,B003YJEO24,"I agree with the last reviewer - while this is a great workout, the quality of this DVD is so poor, it's unfortunately, not worth the hassle. You can only play the entire workout which means you have to fast forward through each section to get where you want - frustrating. The DVD keeps sticking and whirling and I know it's a matter of time before the DVD will give out. This is really too bad because the moves in each section are unique and challenging and Chris Freytag is a no-nonsense motivating instructor. I would only buy one of her videos from College Video because their return policy is so good.",1288310400,4,608,4.4375
