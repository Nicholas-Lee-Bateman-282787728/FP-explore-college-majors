3916678,2,B002EBRF92,"I have no earthly idea why amazon won't put up my review for this film on their website, but whatever. I'm probably wasting my time typing this up.  I had a much larger review but I deleted it now.

Anyway, this film is pretty average.  Kids stumble across a shortcut in the woods where a crazy old man lives, and apparently he likes killing dogs (and -as we find out later- people as well).

He's not a particularly scary enemy either- more like a creepy old sheltered loner guy who needs to get out more often.

The acting skills from all the teenagers is really bad and the storyline is pretty boring as well.  Most of the storyline is spent sneaking into the old mans property and trying to discover secrets about him.  The teens never do anything remotely interesting though, and so the storyline ends up feeling completely pointless.

At least the killing scenes at the end qualify as watchable material, otherwise I'd give it a rating even lower than a 2.  Yes that's right- a zero, haha.",1278720000,,995,4.5139664804469275
3916679,4,B002EBRF92,"This is a PG-13 Movie. So the level of Gore is minimal. But this doesn't mean it doesn't scare the hell out of you, many times in different ways. On the contrary, this  actually results in an interesting situation for the film maker: Since they can't take the easy way most horror movie makers take nowadays and do just gore, gore, gore and zero substance, they're kind of forced to craft a good story and good tension scenes, to replace the scary factor of the gore they can't really show you, and ultimately this benefits the movie greatly. This movie is kind of a hybrid between thriller and slasher film, all in an entertaining package. It held my interest from beginning to end and had a couple of nice twists at the end. A solid offering from Scary Madison (Adam Sandler's venture as a producer into scary movies). It's not the best scary movie I've ever seen, but I had a great time watching it and it was way more entertaining that many gorier movies out there today. (And don't get me wrong: I LOVE GORE. But If I have to choose between gore and a well written, scripted, interesting movie, I choose the later any day of the week)",1277596800,,1139,4.423809523809524

3916682,3,B002EBRF92,"There seems to be a shortage of horror films for the pre-teen audience out there. Those children who are of age where they can enjoy a good scary film but are not quite old enough to witness the bloody carnage that most employ. Unfortunately most are unwilling to sit through a black and white film, thus denying their chance to see such classics as the original FRANKENSTEIN or THE WOLF MAN. So they either are exposed to early to the gore or are left wanting. It looks like Adam Sandler's company wants to change that.

Having made his comedy hits under the banner of Happy Madison Productions, Sandler's company now turns to horror with Scary Madison Productions. Their first outing is a nice littler horror film called THE SHORTCUT.

As with most horror films, we are told from the start about a woods where no one trespasses for fear of coming across the old man who lives there. The shortcut might get you home quicker but only if you can get across without being stopped or worse.  So of course the new kid will take the shortcut home on a dare.

Yes, he runs into some crazy looking person while walking down the path, finding what appears to be the remains of a dog that's been butchered. He gets away and makes it home to a big brother who scolds him for taking the path, hinting at something that happened in the past.

The school tough guy finds out about the youngster finding the dead dog and asks his brother to help him since his dog has gone missing and may be the one seen. That night, against the suggestions of steering clear, the pair go off to find the old man's house and to see if the dog (or what is left of him) is there.

What do friends do in a situation like this? Call the police? Ask for help? Of course not! They go right behind them to help if they can, never telling anyone else where they've gone.

What they find makes for an interesting amount of scares, but nothing too terrible for the average 11 year old to worry about. But the twist ending will be one that will have them second guessing anything they see in the future.

This film is not the best film ever made, nor one of the best horror films done. But it does offer a few scares, some decent effects (though most are off screen) and a great ending. Best of all it tosses in the most clich of teen horror film ideas without making them seem clich, a great way to prepare a new generation of horror fans before they get to the gore drenched items. It may not be a movie you want to add to your collection, but does make a decent rental.",1263168000,2,2531,4.2914046121593294
3916683,4,B002EBRF92,"The Shortcut wasn't a hardcore horror flick but then again it was a  PG-13 thriller .
I didn't mind that there wasn't gratuitous violence in it and I usually like a lot of gratuitous violence.

The actors are appealing and the characters interesting enough to keep your attention. It's more of a mystery and that lends to it's appeal.

They don't sugarcoat anything or have any less victims of violent deaths because it's PG-13 they just make you use your imagination more instead of showing you the actual kill in full effect.

There are a couple of twists that I saw coming but it was still a good story and cleverly done.

I think even a slasher fan ""like myself"" would enjoy this movie,I did.

There is a story within a story. The back story is how the Shortcut came to be and as time goes by reveals one of the mysteries..",1257206400,9,827,4.407894736842105

An old man who's owned a farm there his whole life doesn't take kindly to visitors.  And if you think you know what's coming next, you have no idea.

Unlike a lot of recent horror flicks, ""The Shortcut"" has no big special effect budgets or gratuitous violence. The movie's thrills are created by its creepiness and atmosphere; it builds suspense instead of raising the body count.  I'd compare it more to ""Halloween"" or classic Hitchcock than ""Saw"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" ""The Shortcut"" is subtle, smart, and, with its hot cast--including Katrina Bowden (""30 Rock"") and heartthrob Drew Seeley (""Another Cinderella Story"")--a great date movie.",1254700800,11,800,5.076335877862595
3916687,1,B002EBRF92,"There is nothing necessarily wrong with a harmless horror film, even one that is made for younger audiences. The Shortcut is one such a film, as it is a PG-13 movie made for the type of pubescent audience that would probably prefer safe scares. However, where such films as The Monster Squad or Gremlins did a fine job in their light approach, The Shortcut is not only immature in its sensibility, but also in its typical, clichd, and much lacking storytelling.

The Shortcut may at first seem to have a fun premise: the title route provides the premise of a quick jaunt through the woods near a school that often gets murderous for animals and humans alike. However, the film quickly seems to go in circles, and the plot moves along unnaturally which renders the at-first-fun film pretty uninspired, uneven, and lacking both a scary and truly funny spirit.

Although there might be a few quips by the mostly likeable characters, it garners merely a polite half-smile, but never any true laughs...and since the scares are all telegraphed for experienced audiences, The Shortcut never generates scares or dread. This could be ok, however, if it had some sort of tension or emotion to grasp onto, but it lacks this even in the anticipative way.

Plot wise, the film mainly has the characters looking for a sign of what happended to one of their friend's dog. Problem is, they say they are sure the dog is dead, and even if you understand they are looking for evidence of this animal cruelty, it still seems a rather childish plot ploy.

Filled with many false jump scares, The Shortcut is also inline often with pop culture and teeny-bopper self-satirical references. At times it even insults its audience, like in the out-of-the-blue twist ending.

As aforementioned, the characters are mostly likeable even despite their shallow stereotypes. It is also interesting to note that the main old-man villain shows a slight resemblance to Michael Berryman of the original The Hills Have Eyes. Yet, the positives aspects only go so far.

In the final act, The Shortcut takes every normal mechanics of the fright genre, and each plot point is extremely predictable, at least up until that tacked on ending that just seems preposterous. One realizes that The Shortcut is a film that took its title way to literally for all the wrong reasons. It makes the audience know that it is never ok to make a shortcut in film... especially if its leaves behind all the credible genre aspects in its run to the finish line.

But, all kidding aside, this is a good movie. The actors were good, the writers were good; I guess almost everyone involved in getting this film out did a good job! The plot was creative and interesting and while I DID guess some of the outcomes, the ending came out of nowhere and really blew me away! I was NOT expecting that one and that's one of the things I love in a movie.

3916697,4,B002EBRF92,"Wait a minute.  When did Adam Sandler start making horror films?  Apparently, it was in 2009.  The Shortcut was the first release from Scary Madison, part of the Happy Madison production company Sandler started.  The word is that Adam Sandler and crew set out to do it right, with R-rated material, but some of the folks actually financing the film insisted that it be PG-13.  They already had the teenaged eye candy sure to attract teen viewers, with the likes of Andrew Seeley and Katrina Bowden playing significant roles.  And you know what?  Things actually worked out pretty well.  The Shortcut certainly doesn't break any new ground in the horror genre, it doesn't manage to generate any real scares, and you can spot the final twist from a mile away, but I still enjoyed watching it.  The teen characters are actually likeable, there's a decent amount of humor along the way, and the story doesn't leave any holes in its wake.  For a straight-to-DVD release, The Shortcut really isn't a bad little movie at all - it's just the kind that would be more at home on cable television than in theatres.

The story really begins in 1945, as that's when the shortcut through the woods behind Hartley Elementary School began to earn its reputation as a spot to be avoided at all costs.  The legend says that there's a crazy old man out there who likes to scare and oftentimes kill anyone foolish enough to come that way.  Derek (Andrew Seeley) and his younger brother Tobey (Nicholas Elia) just moved to town two months ago, so they haven't heard any of the stories - not until Tobey is dared by some classmates to prove how tough he is by taking the shortcut home.  That leads Derek and some of his friends to investigate the wooded area for themselves; Derek even manages to drag Christy (Katrina Bowden), the fantastically hot object of his affections, into the adventure.  Needless to say, the whole thing is a really bad idea.

As events progress in the current day, we get a series of flashbacks to the 1940s and 1950s that help fill in the backstory of what is really going on out there in the woods.  These scenes actually serve a purpose, as the whole truth can only be discovered by putting both of the storylines together in the end.  I actually was surprised by one revelation, but the final twist, as I mentioned earlier, will be expected by a majority of viewers.  That doesn't make it bad - just really predictable.  The script as a whole - which was co-written by Adam Sandler's brother Scott - is actually remarkably tight for a film of this genre.  You have to put two and two together at times, but everything comes full circle in the end.  The Shortcut will appeal more to teenaged audiences than hardcore horror fans, but this horror veteran really enjoyed his trek down The Shortcut.",1369440000,,2803,4.62020202020202
3916701,4,B002EBRF92,"The Shortcut isn't the typical B-movie slasher film you'd expect it to be. The movie actually has a plot, a decent story to follow, and a great cast. A great cast can be the difference in a film like this and they defiantly did a great job here. For decades, people had been disappearing from the woods behind Hartley Elementary and no one is sure why, but after something scared the s*** out of his little brother, Derek (Drew Seeley) is going to find out what it is. Shannon Woodward of the Riches and James Franco's little brother give strong performances and some comic relief in support of Drew Seeley. Seeley is a newcomer to me, but his intensity was contagious and really helped me get into this film. I also really liked how they moved between modern day and what happened in the past. The seemingly innocent shortcut through the woods has a very interesting story behind it. It's somewhat believable and pretty intense. This is billed as a slasher film, but there isn't much gore at all, what there is doesn't come until much later in the film. The Shortcut won't win any awards, but it will certainly entertain you.

3916706,3,B002EBRF92,"All small towns have their spooky legends, especially in movies and books.  In this town, the legend says don't use the shortcut from the school through the woods.  If you do, ""the old man"" will get you.

This legend dates back to the 1940s when a young couple are leaving a high school dance, and the boy suggests they cut through the woods to get home quicker.  While walking through the woods, the boy tries to rape the girl, but she fights him off and he leaves.  As she's lying on the ground, bloody and frightened, a little boy appears.  She asks him for help, but he just hits her with a rock before continuing the assault with his slingshot.  Turns out 11-year-old Benjamin Hartley (of the town's famous Hartleys) is a psychopathic killer, murdering anyone who dares the shortcut through the woods on his family's property.  To prevent any more killings, Benjamin's family eventually chains him up in the basement on an extra long chain that enables him to reach a rock at the rear of his backyard where he sits contemplating whatever young psychopaths contemplate.

Cut to 2009 and Derek (Drew Seely, ANOTHER CINDARELLA STORY) and his family have just moved to town two months ago following the death of Derek's father.  He and his mother and brother now live with Derek's grandmother as they put their life back together.  Derek's got a fast food job and two good friends, Lisa (Shannon Woodward, ""Raising Hope"") and Mark (Dave Franco, ""Scrubs"").  One day some kids from the elementary school dare Dereks' brother Tobey to cut through the woods, which he does, finding a dead dog on the way before being frightened away by an old man with a shovel who tells Tobey next time it'll be HIS blood.

Terrified, Tobey tells Derek, who tells Mark, who tells everyone in school, which leads to fellow student Taylor (John Emerson, JENNIFER'S BODY) asking Derek what kind of dig his brother found; Taylor's dog Tammy has been missing for a few days.  Taylor and Derek decide to go through the woods and see if they can find it, which leads to them winding up at the Hartley place where Old Man Hartley (Raymond Barry, ""Justified"") is working in his barn.  When he leaves, the two sneak in and find a coffee can full of old dog tags.  Convinced something sinister is afoot, they decide to come back one night when Old Man Hartley is at the VFW and see what else they can dig up.

Also in on Operation: Old Man are Lisa and Mark, and Derek gets his crush Christy (Katrina Bowden, "" 30 Rock"") in on the action as well.  While Derek and Christy stake out the VFW, Taylor, Lisa and Mark enter the Hartley home and see what they can see.  What they see is another old man chained up in the basement with a shackle around his neck.  He asks them to help him get away before the old man comes back.

Bad move.

THE SHORTCUT is a 2009 Direct-to-DVD movie produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions through its Scary Madison subsidiary and, personally, other than the twist at the end, which if you've been paying attention at all during the movie isn't a twist at all (no, I don't mean that the old man chained in the basement is the real killer, that's not a surprise at all; the actual twist isn't a bad one, just sort of typical and meh), I didn't see much reason for this movie to exist at all.  In fact, in the end it felt, to me, like the entire preceding 85 minutes was ALL just build up to this one moment at the end of the movie, and that feels like a huge letdown.

There is little to no tension.  Hell it's not until well over an hour into the movie before there's even a hint of danger for our main characters.  The use of the 1940s flashbacks, sprinkled throughout the narrative, was supposed to imply the threat, but all it does is give our killer a backstory and make him, in the viewers' eyes, more human.  Granted, he's still a psychopathic killer, but throughout acts one and two, the inference is that Old Man Hartley is the little killer kid all grown up, but then we see him driving his truck, working in his barn, ordering a hot dog from the fast food joint where Derek works, and we say these aren't the actions of an unstoppable killer.  He had some problems growing up, sure, but he's still able to function in society, just don't use the shortcut on his property, that seems reasonable.  I wouldn't want a bunch of people cutting through my yard, either.

And the main characters were annoying anyway.  Follow the cause and effect.  Derek wants to get back at Old Man Hartley for scaring his little brother.  Hey, his little brother was trespassing; the sign at the edge of the woods clearly reads No Trespassing, but Tobey went through there anyway.  And it's not like he CHASED Tobey with the shovel, he just warned him next time it'd be HIS blood instead of a dog's.  That's a little harsh, sure, but Tobey was still trespassing, so I can see wanting to scare him off.  So where does Derek get off thinking because Old Man Hartley scared his little brother that then gives HIM the right to cut through the woods?  Jeez, people, just stay off the guy's property and there's no problem at all.  It's a shortcut, sure, but there are also a ton of yards I could cut through on my way to work to get there a little quicker, but I don't do it.

I can understand Taylor's motivation, wanting to find out what happened to his dog.  But as far as I'm concerned, Taylor's the only one of the group who has any right to be involved.  Mark and Lisa are just troublemakers looking for a small town thrill, while Derek's only motivation is to get Christy involved so they can stake out the VFW together and he can, hopefully, get lucky.  He's basically Ren McCormack, only the law in this town doesn't prohibit dancing, it prohibits trespassing.  And dmmit, Derek's just gotta go where he doesn't belong, even if it means people get killed.  Soon he'll be standing up at the town hall meeting and quoting Bible verses about trespassing and organizing trespassing parties in the neighboring towns.  He'll walk into the party and whoop ""LET'S TRESPASS!""

The story was written by Dan Hannon and Scott Sandler (Adam's brother.  That explains it), and directed by Nicholaus Goossen (GRANDMA'S BOY...no, I didn't see that one, either), so we've got two writers who've never written a movie before, one of whom grew up with the owner of the production company, and a director whose only other notable credit was for a movie that didn't even look good for a Happy Madison production.  That's got success written all over it.

If this is the type of ""horror"" movie the horror division of Happy Madison is going to be producing, I'd like to save them millions of dollars right now.  While being geared toward an obviously teen demographic, I think even they're going to be uninterested in movies like this.  Horror movies need to threaten the audience, not warn them off.  When horny teens went to Camp Crystal Lake, Jason massacred every one of them.  When horny teens snuck into the Meyer house on Halloween, Michael Meyers slaughtered them.  And in both cases, the killer was portrayed as an unstoppable machine, hellbent on death and destruction while defending their property against trespassers.  In THE SHORTCUT, the ""killer"" is an old man who drives a beatup pickup and likes mustard and onions on his hot dog.  Sure, he'll kill you a little bit, but not til after Final Jeopardy, and if you need him on Friday night, he'll be at the VFW, presumably complaining about these dmn kids always cutting through his yard!",1343520000,,7531,4.545994065281899

  The premise of the movie is a mom and her 2 sons have just moved to a new place. They've been there a few months. One's a teen in high school, the other's about in 6th or 7th grade. One day afterschool, the youngest is talking to 2 other kids after school and they ask him if he's taken the shortcut before. He tells them no and they dare him. So he accepts. As he's walking, he trips over a dead dog and comes across a mean old man with a rifle letting him know in so many words that he'll be next if he comes back.

  The boy runs away obviously scared. He gets home and tells his older brother what happened. His older brother tells some of his friends about the incident. One day at school, the football jock asks the guy what's up with this stuff he heard that happened with his little brother. The kid tells him it's true and asks him why. The guy lets him know because his dogs been missing. That's what prompts the teens to explore the shortcut.

  From there, you'll have to watch the movie for yourself. But it's got plenty of jumps, and a good movie for teens to really connect with as far as how they talk and the jokes made. It also has an ending that will blow you away. Defintely worth watching. I'm glad I bought it and added it to my collection instead of just renting. My kids and I really liked it. Great movie, great acting, great plot, great twists and turns, and an awesome ending!!",1303257600,4,1582,4.177631578947368
3916710,4,B002EBRF92,"What's an older brother supposed to do when his younger brother is a psychopath? Bury the evidence and keep younger brother chained in the basement. However this is a veeeeery long chain and over the years children as well as small animals have gone missing along a shortcut through the woods. A recently widowed mother with her two sons have settled into a small town.  The younger brother is dared by his classmates to take the shortcut through the woods where he finds a gutted dog and is spooked by a creepy looking man with a shovel who asks the kid, ""do you like blood?  The next time it will be yours"". After tripping and falling into the dog's blood the boy makes it home and tells his older brother what happened.

The next day at school the older brother is telling a friend about what his younger brother saw walking the shortcut and is overheard by a jock who's dog has gone missing.

The creepy looking man is the older brother of the psycho chained in the basement and the rest of the movie involves some teens including the jock and the older brother and their friends snooping around the house of the creepy man. They find the chained younger brother in the celler and mistakenly think he's being held prisoner and try to help him.....then......

I found this movie by accident channel surfing and as it was just starting I began to watch it and got sucked-in. Admittedly this is a horror movie for the mid-teen audience as the gore is non-existent but it has a lot of tense moments and a surprise ending I didn't see coming although on reflection-there are clues.

Not a great movie but certainly not a waste of time.",1282089600,3,1634,4.503378378378378

8367479,3,B002EBRF92,"Was going good until a decrepit 70 some year old man that has been chained to a bed for years and years (with a heavy chain), kicks their butts.  Really.  I know your hand is hurt but believe me if someone as slow as this guy was coming at you with a heavy sledge hammer, you'd move.

Anyway it was good up until that point.",1510963200,,324,3.953846153846154
