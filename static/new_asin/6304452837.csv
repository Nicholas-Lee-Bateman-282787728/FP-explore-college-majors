887644,5,6304452837,"Here's one of Billy Wilder's earlier works which has his magic touch - by far the best director Hollywood ever produced; an action-packed WWII thriller.
  With a complete story, actors, scenery, photography, and drama and his intangible ability to draw you into the story without knowing it - and ring's every emotional nerve you have.  A genuine genius at storytelling and beautiful workmanship to look at.
  Franchot Tone, one of the cruelly underrated finest actors and the breathtaking Ann Baxter will tear you apart.
  Superb supporting cast of Eric Von Stroheim (sp), and Akhim Tamiroff (sp) et al, all make this thriller spin together seemlessly.  A genuine suspense mystery with the threat of action everywhere.  One of my favorites.
  The stunning and exceptionally talented very young Ann Baxter is delicious and excellent, as also in the Fighting Sullivans and The Razors Edge (an oscar).  Gawd she was lovely.
  Don't miss this.  You'll also get a taste of Billy Wilder's unique artist's hand which are in all his works.",1004659200,19,1032,5.059523809523809

888062,5,6304452837,"This 1943 production of a WWII accidental British spy played by Franchot (smooth-talking) Tone perfectly fits his style, having first view it in the late 60's on the late show.  I only caught it on the tube a couple of times over the years, and that opening scene of a British tank marching through the Sahara Desert with a dead crew is bone-chilling every time I have view it; Billy Wilder direction at its finest.  Excellent character performances were turned in by Anne Baxter the practical and pragmatic French chambermaid, until she is betrayed by a German would-be lover.  Akin Tamiroff is the Egyptian owner of The Empress of Britian Hotel nervous as a trapped rat in a roomful of rat traps.  Then the quint-essential performance of a Nazi officer played by Erich Von Stroheim doing a no nonsense Field Marshall Erwin Rommel, who is described by the hotel owner in his cruel and brutal execution of the hotel maid when she defies Rommel and the Nazi Germany that he represent in North Africa.

There were a number of films being produced at this juncture in history depicting the domination of would-be conquers and the desperate need for democratic nation states to rise up and defeat the savage and mad outlaw countries of Germany, Japan and Italy; known as the Axis Powers.  Other classic examples are: Sahara, Bataan, Lifeboat, and Casablanca all with the same overall theme of unity in diversity to defeat the mad dogs of war.",1444003200,3,1438,4.778225806451613

888259,3,6304452837,"Five Graves to Cairo, 1943 film

In June 1942 the British Eighth Army was being pushed back to Cairo by German forces under Rommel. One tank goes on by itself. J. J. Bramble escapes and walks on, the sole survivor. The German forces move into town. An officer takes charge and questions the people in the hotel, they will use it as headquarters. That British soldier puts on civilian clothes to play the waiter. Paul Davos is a German spy! Mouche talks to Bramble. [Talk pads out the story.] British prisoners are marched through the streets. Mouche talks to Rommel. The Lieutenant talks to Mouche. British officers arrive, one looks at Davos. They want information from Rommel. There is a body in the cellar, can it be kept hidden?

Can Davos discover where the Germans hid water, fuel, and ammunition? Yes, it was hidden in plain sight. Davos traces a copy onto a handkerchief! An air raid sends everyone to the cellar. The Lieutenant finds something in the cellar! There is personal conflict. They found the Lieutenant in Mouches room! Then Davos leaves for Cairo. Can Mouche be saved? Yes, with new evidence tomorrow. The German Army was stopped at El Alamein, then forced back. The Americans invaded North Africa at the back of the German Army, the Germans are defeated. Bramble learns what happened. Mouche isn't there to greet him Bramble leaves a parasol for her.

This is one of the movies that tells about the culture of war-time America. It is less dramatic than other movies from that era, perhaps because of its origin as a stage play. This story of buried military supplies seems implausible, given British control of Egypt in 1937. There would have to be shiploads that could not be easily hidden. What about the shelf life of food then?",1429488000,,1752,4.737704918032787

888262,4,6304452837,"Having been burned previously by buying dvd's on Amazon based upon lucrative -and as it turns out - totally bogus four and five star ratings from buyers on Amazon, I must say I was skeptical about buying this one.  For example, ""Stalag 17"" - another film by Billy Wilder - got huge ratings on Amazon but I hated it.  You guys really think Holden's performance was better than ""River Kwai?""  No way.  Then came Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes"" (the whole first hour is just incoherent, irrelevant and a waste to time) which also was and is loaded up with multitudes of five star ratings but I thought it was horrible.  Another one:  ""The Key,"" with Trevor Howard and William Holden, a WWII story.  Five star ratings galore, so it should be good, right?  Nope.  Sophia Loren is completely miscast and the depressing story line killed it, in my humble opinion.  I bought this one at the same time I bought ""The Lady Vanishes"" and after that proved to be complete disappointment I was thinking of delaying watching this one.  Why bother?  Just another viewer-excess rating.  Who are you people that found these previously mentioned movies good?  Really?

I collect old movies.  I love them.  I'm here to tell you, this one is a keeper.  I must say, at the start, I rolled my eyes and said to myself, ""Billy Wilder, here we go again.  More tacky pointless comedy/drama mix, more failed plot.""  We see a guy falls of a moving tank in the desert that is running on its own at an easily catchable 5 mph.  Follow the tank tracks guy to catch it!  No, our hero is seen wandering lost in the sand elsewere.  Huh?  Then later, he's shown conversing in private with Rommel and his aide...in English.  Right.

But I must say, unlike wasting the entire first hour of ""The Lady Vanishes"" trying to figure out the non-plot, this one moves along pretty good.  Better, it improves in gobs as the plot unfolds.  My only real complaint is silly and stupid portrayal of Rommel by Wilder and actor Erich Von Stroheim was almost comical and almost killed the movie.  But the plot - especially the writing - is so good...and Franchot Tone's and Ann Baxter's acting is so good...that it doesn't matter.  But this is why I gave this one 4 vs. 5 stars.

The ending.  If ever there was a case for movie makers to start creating alternate endings, this one is the poster child for it.  Oh, how I would have loved to have a happy ending.  The sad-but-patriotic ending works, though.  But if I could have had the alternate, like I got in ""Sailor For the King,"" I would have enjoyed this movie more.

I must say, I've never heard of the lead role actor Franchot Tone, but he was GREAT!  I would even say, he stole the show.  Baxter is a close second.  I thought she was also excellent.

In the end, this movie works.  It manages to overcome director Wilder's tendency to irrelevant silliness that ruined Stalag 17 to become in fact a really good movie.  I would highly recommend adding it to your collection.",1418601600,5,2974,4.5131578947368425

888367,5,6304452837,This is a widely overlooked WWII film about a British soldier separated from his unit who hides in a hotel as Rommel's staff occupies it. The acting is quite good. The story is suspenseful and believable.  The quality of the age used to make the disk is clear and crisp.  Highly recommended!,1404604800,,291,4.576923076923077
888368,5,6304452837,"The backdrop is early in the war and set against a German rout of the British in North Africa where a surviving soldier of a British tank crew crawls to a desolate town and given refuge by a hotel owner accompanied by one remaining chamber maid. This is a period film with somewhat typical period acting. Anyone familiar with Franchot Tone and Akim Tamiroff will not be surprised as they perform as they usually do. Tamiroff plays a timid pedestrian as opposed to his much more despicable character in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943). Erich Von Stroheim also turns in a typical (for him) performance, although in this character as General Erwin Rommel, he is nowhere near as lovable as most post-war historians usually portray him. I find Anne Baxter's role as the chambermaid somewhat outside the usual mold for her, and as always I fortunately find her great natural beauty remains quite visible. Younger audiences use to today's intense action in films may find this movie a bit too slow. What little violence is present is highly muted as most '40s era films tend to be, but the film leaves no doubt to its presence. For WWII collectors this is a must.",1393718400,3,1155,4.666666666666667

Filmed on a relatively low budget in one primary location, a hotel located near El Alamein and other desert battlefields that were traded back and forth between Allied and German forces. Directed by Billy Wilder, this is one of his best. Akim Tamiroff and Franchot Tone round out a cast with Ann Baxter and Erich Von Stroheim as Field Marshall Erwin Rommel, the Desert Fox. Von Stroheim was given carte blanche to cast and train the German troops for the film, specifically their actions, behavior and wardrobe, right down to buttons on their uniforms. Everything had to be completely accurate. Wilder's economy of direction in this film permitted the actors to spread their wings as it were, to make beleivable characters shine within a somewhat claustrophobic interior set [location].

But don't take my word for it! SEE IT FOR YOURSELF! I've been trying to locate a Region 1 copy for years. You can own it on DVD thanks to Turner Classic Movies and Amazon. A COLLECTORS TREASURE FOR SURE!",1374105600,22,1093,4.8138297872340425
888526,3,6304452837,"There is no doubt:  ""Five Graves to Cairo"" is an interesting movie. As FGC opens, a British corporal (Franchot Tone) stumbles into a desolate hotel in the Egyptian desert.  The rest of his tank crew has been killed by the Germans. The hotel is soon taken over by Field Marshall Rommel and his staff. The Germans panzers are racing toward Cairo to defeat Field Marshall Montgomery's armies!

To save himself, Tone assumes the identity of a German spy planted at the hotel in advance of Rommel's arrival. The role of Rommel is vastly overplayed by Erich von Stroheim.  Superior work is done by Akim Tamiroff as the harried proprietor and Anne Baxter as the hotel maid with a very personal motive to curry favor with the Field Marsall.  Will Tamiroff or Baxter turn Tone in?

What are the ""5 Graves""? This reviewer won't reveal, but the number ""5"" matters!  The curious must watch the film. They will not regret it.

""5 Graves to Cairo"" is superior entertainment with a good deal of suspense and tight directing by helmsman Billy Wilder.  The desert atmosphere is great. But the movie is loaded with plot inconsistencies. Some have been mentioned by previous reviewers.  Taken together, these reduce the rank above by two stars. The entertainment here is wonderful but someone has to watch those small details-especially in wartime. Those concerned with pure viewer interest will wish to add a star or two to the rating above.

Out of the tank and on the desert sand, John is weak.  The tank moves on without him and he begins to take a long walk through the desert.  He comes upon a straight road with a  small hotel named, ""Empress of Britain"" in Sidi Halfaya, Egypt. Just what he needed.  He is desert dry delirious, talking to people that are not there.  Inside the nice hotel, two people of the hotel watch him cautiously. Farid (Akim Tamiroff) and Mouche (Anne Baxter) come to his aid. John passes out.
  Suddenly, the Germans arrive at the hotel. Farid begs John to wake up.  John hides as the Germans come into the hotel. Lt. Schwegler (Peter van Eyck) and his men decide to stay in the hotel and prepare it for its leader.
  John decides to disguise himself as a waiter, so the Germans won't know he was from the battle.

With a record like this, it's hard to give a Billy Wilder film a low mark, but ""Five Graves to Cairo"" is clearly among his lesser works.

Released in 1943, it came right in the middle of a creative period for Wilder, having made ""Ninotchka"" in 1939, ""Double Indemnity"" in 1944 and ""The Lost Weekend"" in 1945. Of course, Wilder didn't really come into his own as a Director until 1944, and his earlier successes were as a writer. In fact, ""Five Graves"" was only Wilder's second film as a Director, and perhaps this is the problem.

In any event, the film stars Franchot Tone, Akim Tamiroff, and Anne Baxter with
Erich von Stroheim as Field Marshall Rommel.

Franchot Tone plays a British spy. His distinct American accent is definitely out of whack, and this may be why Wilder wanted Cary Grant to play the role. Tone was a well known actor at the time, having co-starred in ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935) for which he was nominated for a Best Actor award (Victor McLaglen won for ""The Informer"" even though Mutiny won for Best Picture). He'd also been in the successful ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935) and more than a dozen films in which he often played the spoiled rich guy.

Anne Baxter had just completed a good supporting role opposite Joseph Cotton  in Orson Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942) and then she got top billing for ""North Star"" (1943), a WW 2 drama in which she played a Russian peasant. In this film she plays a French waitress. A few years later she won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for ""The Razor's Edge"" (1946) and was nominated for an Oscar for her role as the ambitious Eve Harrington in ""All About Eve"" (1950). In 1956 she appeared as Queen Nefertiri in ""The Ten Commandments"" which is probably the peak of her career.

Baxter's co-star in ""North Star"" was Erich von Stroheim who played an evil German doctor. Von Stroheim was a famous German silent film director (""Greed"", ""The Merry Widow"", ""The Lost Squadron""), but he got into too many arguments when the talkie era started, and he turned to acting. He had plenty of experience playing the evil German soldier in the silent era (""The Hun Within"", ""The Heart of Humanity"") so he transitioned easily into his role for this film. Von Stroheim is perhaps best remembered for his Oscar nominated role as the film director Max Von Mayerling in ""Sunset Blvd"" (1950). Here he plays Rommel in a manner that people familiar with the real Rommel will not recognize. But it's the way von Stroheim wanted to play it, and Billy Wilder had been a great admirer of von Stroheim, and basically let him do whatever he wanted to do.

Akim Tamiroff worked with Tone in ""Bengal Lancer"" (1935) and was a busy actor in the 30s and 40s, although I think his best performance was in Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" (1956). He had been nominated for an Oscar for his supporting role in ""The General Died at Dawn"" (1936) and would be nominated again in 1944 in ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", losing to Charles Coburn (""The More the Merrier) but he would win the Golden Globe.

The film got mixed reviews. The New York Times praised von Stroheim but said the film had ""the flavor of fun in a haunted house"" adding that ""it has a little something for all tastes, providing you don't give a damn."" Variety said it was ""a dynamic moving vehicle"" and the Chicago Reader called Wilder's directing ""excellent apprentice work.""  It garnered 3 (minor) Academy Award nominations (Editing, Cinematography, and Art Direction) but didn't win any. Best Picture and Best Director that year went to ""Casablanca"".

One of the problems with the film is that it is basically a 1927 play, written by Lajos Biro and called ""Hotel Imperial"". It had been made as a film in 1927 and again in 1939. As such, almost all the action takes place in the hotel, and as such, it can make for a dull movie. On the other hand, consider that ""Casablanca"" is a similar film that takes place basically in one location, yet manages to overcome this obstacle.

Another problem is the accents. Tone and Baxter are capable actors, but their accents are poor, and Tamiroff is a Russian trying to affect an Egyptian accent. It just doesn't work. Von Stroheim's accent is clearly different from the German actors, and if you listen closely you'll hear it.

There are also some notable plot flaws. Tone comes in from the desert, out of his mind, and the next thing you know he is playing a spy. A pretty quick recovery! Then there's a body in the cellar for days and no one notices the smell. What's up with that? Then we have the Germans speaking German among themselves, but speaking English to Tone. But since Tone is also a German, why do they speak English to him? Then we get a Corporal in the Infantry getting promoted to a Lieutenant and Tank Commander. How does that happen?

Putting these problems aside, this is not a bad film. It has a little mystery and intrigue (e.g., what are the 5 graves?) and some good acting even if the accents are poor. But given the kinds of magic that Billy Wilder was capable of, and given the status of the cast, it's clearly under-whelming.",1272240000,3,5524,4.588235294117647
888532,5,6304452837,"FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO opens on a suffocating desert scene and, reflexively, I want to reach for a glass of water. British infantryman John J. Bramble (Franchot Tone) wakes up in a still moving tank and keeping company with cadavers. Unable to remain conscious he falls off and the tank rumbles on without him. It's not certain how long Bramble then wanders the desert, weak and hallucinatory, but he eventually arrives at a blasted village by the sea and at the ironically-called Hotel Empress of Britain. In this desert hotel Bramble finds no solace and respite, no ease of mind, no safe harbor from the enemy. Moments after Bramble reaches the hotel, the German panzers roll in, and their occupants self-satisfied and Teutonic. Begins the cat and mouse games.

There's a distinguished guest lodging in the Hotel Empress of Britain in the person of Field Marshal Rommel himself. Rommel mentions a cryptic German plan involving five graves. As circumstances unfold Bramble is able to pass himself off as the hotel's crippled waiter (the real one having been a recent casualty of a bombing raid). And as it turns out this waiter was in fact an advance spy working for the Nazis, and so Bramble, common infantryman, finds himself in an unfamiliar position to do his side an undercover solid. But what are the five graves to Cairo? It really doesn't matter, it's enough that the five graves play the role of the film's MacGuffin (for those who care, the five graves are the locations of the German supply depots in Egypt). For Bramble, it's a nervous high wire act. New obstacles keep surfacing, the tension mounts unbearably, Bramble's masquerade ever on the verge of being pierced. What fun!

FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO is a gripping but little known 1943 wartime spy thriller, and this is only Billy Wilder's second film at the helm (third, if you count his French film MAUVAISE GRAINE), except that you'd never know this was one of Wilder's earliest films directing. This is such a self-assured movie and so well-crafted, from the screenplay to the pacing to the performances. Franchot Tone and Akim Tamiroff (as the fidgety innkeeper) are marvelous, and they're not even the best ones here because Erich von Stroheim as the sour-pussed Rommel simply hijacks the picture.

Also a standout is Anne Baxter. She plays the sullen, anguished French maid Mouche who willingly bargains with the Germans in hopes of gaining freedom for her captured brother. There's a moment when Bramble chastises Mouche: ""It's not one brother who matters, it's a million brothers!"" And I was thinking ""That's fine talk,"" but of course only if it's not your own brother in question. And, later, how can you not cheer when she taunts Rommel spiritedly: ""Two steps back!"" I'm not a big fan of the desert, but FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO and Bogie's SAHARA are two of my most cherished wartime films. Their underdog status - because they're not exactly heralded nowadays - merely adds to their appeal. Field Marshal Rommel vows: ""We shall take that big fat cigar out of Mr. Churchill's mouth and make him say Heil."" But it didn't quite happen that way.",1272067200,,3112,4.845864661654136

***SPOILERS***

Directed by Billy Wilder, well-written by Charles Brackett, and anchored by Erich von Stroheim's performance, FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO remains a splendid WWII film for classic movie lovers. And though it may be less historically accurate than THE DESERT FOX (1951), in my opinion, it is more fun.

The plot involves Franchot Tone, who plays Corporal John Bramble.  As the film begins, we meet Bramble, drifting aimlessly in a battle-scarred tank.  He eventually 'comes to' and finds himself the only survivor.  Still dazed, he manages to escape the smoke of the tank by hurling himself outside, onto the hot sand.  It only takes a moment for him to realize that he is still in trouble, now from the desert heat.

The next scene shows a severely sun-afflicted Bramble, babbling and hallucinating.  He has managed to find refuge in a solitary desert hotel, somewhere near the Egyptian border, west of Cairo.  The hotel is managed by Farid (Akim Tamiroff) and a hired French maid, named Mouche (Anne Baxter); both are Allied sympathizers. Once recovered, they have Bramble impersonate their hired help, the club-footed Davos, who was killed in the cellar during an Axis bombing raid the night before.  The impersonation is necessary, because Field Marshal Rommel (Erich von Stroheim) and his entourage soon arrive, and use the hotel as their base.

The fun begins when Bramble finds that Davos was a German spy, and if Bramble plays his cards right, he can kill Rommel.  The assassination is stopped by a captured Allied Colonel (Miles Mander), who convinces Bramble that the true opportunity here lies in the information that can be obtained and given to the Allies.  Bramble's spying eventually pays off, as he discovers the secret of the ""Five Graves"" the Germans have been using, as they advance on Cairo.

A tribute to Tone is the fact that such an outlandish role is pulled off so well.  But both the performances of Tone and Baxter, IMO, revolve around the magnetic von Stroheim.  His interpretation of Rommel was a character he was born to play.  It seems to reflect his domineering directing style.  IMO, one of the few WWII villians captured on celluloid that rivals the like characterizations portrayed by Conrad Veidt.

It is a shame that a Region 1 DVD of this film has yet to be released.",1255651200,2,2340,4.905852417302799
