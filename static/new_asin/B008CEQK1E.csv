7598817,1,B008CEQK1E,"Pros:  Same characters from the first ""season"" of S.A.C., so if you can't get enough of them you can have this.

Cons:  The original series was so well written and executed I knew the second wouldn't be as good, but the reality is this isn't even in the same class. Horrible dialog, overly simplistic plots.  On its own its a pretty dialog heavy anime that drones on and on in each episode with a bit of generic action at the end as a reward, but compared to the original GitS series its a total flop.

Other Thoughts:  I was excited for more of one of my favorite series, only to find different writers with their own agenda (look up the underlying theme of the 2nd Gig., has to do with IRL issues on immigration).  This one isn't worth the time.

If you've never seen the original S.A.C., and you don't mind generic anime fair, this may be ok.",1486252800,5,845,4.30379746835443

7598822,2,B008CEQK1E,"I was really disappointed in these two highly anticipated releases from Anchor Bay/Lionsgate. No english subtitles for the Japanese dub, here in 2017, is ludicrous in this day, this era. And then the mixed up english dub, that is supposed to play english, but in some places plays the japanese dub track for 1 or 2 seconds, is terrible and confusing at the same time. I don't know who is in charge of quality control at Anchor Bay/Lionsgate, but they need to be fired. What is even more inexcusable? Anchor Bay/Lionsgate WON""T FIX the issues with the discs for both sets, despite knowing about the issues...That is Fraud. I will think twice about purchasing that company's product in the future. *****BUYER BEWARE****",1490140800,17,717,4.885245901639344
7598823,1,B008CEQK1E,"Anchor Bay has insulted anime fans everywhere with this repulsive joke of a release.  Both Stand Alone Complex and 2nd Gig are plagued with a variety of issues and frustrations while ignoring the fan outcries with reponses like, ""They were released the way they were meant to be,"" and ""Please contact some other company about this release.""  There is no end to have despicable this is regardless of what type of release.  It does not matter if it is some niche anime title (although, I hardly consider Ghost in the Shell niche) or some big Hollywood block buster, the profesionallism Anchor Bay has display is vile beyond comprehension.  Both sets feaure hearing impaired dubtitles (meaning not only is the script for the English dub, but also features things like, [Explosion]), no chapter breaks whatsoever, not a single shred of a bonus feature (and the old DVDs were full of them), and audio that will be in English one minute, then just switch to Japanese out of the blue for the next, then go back to English.  How anyone in their right mind would knowingly put out a product this shoddy vexes me.  If you are a fan of this franchise, or even wanting to take interest in it, you should feel insulted that it is the best we can get.",1489795200,5,1237,4.6
7598824,4,B008CEQK1E,"It's nice to finally have this series available to purchase easily. The quality of the transfer is great, but only has dubtitles and no special features to speak of. Still a great buy for fans of the franchise.",1489104000,,210,4.552631578947368

7598826,1,B008CEQK1E,Terrible release. Anchor Bay should be ashamed for this vacuous release. Dubtitles in 2017? And to top it off they're only available as closed captioning? Yeesh! An English language audio track with random bursts in from the Japanese audio track? That shows a complete lack of quality control on behalf of Anchor Bay. Throw in the lack of any extras and truly inchoate authoring and one is left with an abysmal product that should never have made it to store shelves.,1488499200,24,467,4.777777777777778
7598827,1,B008CEQK1E,"Once again, I've paid top dollar for a supposedly superior version of an anime that can't even compare to my old DVDs. As everyone else has said, the subtitles here are total ****. When will the makers of anime blu rays get it through their thick, greedy heads that the pennies they save by omitting accurate translations for subtitles, which already exist on the old releases, cost them fans and are making me regret re buying anime on blu ray.",1487894400,26,445,4.575

Stand Alone Complex is one of the best sci-fi TV shows ever, and the Blu-ray that Anchor Bay/Manga USA has put out is a barely watchable release. All the extras are missing from the DVD release, and none of the episodes have chapter breaks. Those, I can get past and get along without. As long as I can watch a high quality presentation of the show, I can be happy with some stuff missing. However, the bare minimum of watching the show isn't possible on this release. Wait... I said all this on the season 1 review...

That's because it's basically has all the same issues.

On the Japanese side, the subtitles are actually a close captioning track for the English audio, not a translation. And look, the dub script happens to be extremely faithful and well-written but it is not a translation. It doesn't translate the music, the signs, and if anyone on the English dub is speaking off-screen, but they aren't speaking in the Japanese version, there's a random line onscreen when it's actually silent.

On the English dub side: For some reason the English audio randomly cuts into the Japanese audio at random points in random episodes. I've even posted some examples on my Twitter feed showing this very error (and I'm including a video example on this review) and being very specific where they happened. Anchor Bay's response was to block me on Twitter.

This is a release that many people were waiting for years, and even the bare minimum of effort wasn't put into this release. And rather than fix it, the response from the distributor so far was to ignore me. I would highly recommend reaching out to Anchor Bay and telling them about the issues about this release. Hopefully, their response to you is better than mine.",1487721600,89,2118,5.547987616099071
7598829,1,B008CEQK1E,"No true subtitle track, issues with english audio, decimated video source. Avoid this particular release.",1487635200,11,105,6.066666666666666
7598830,2,B008CEQK1E,"This is the same as the Season 1 Blu-ray set, which is to say, it's not a great release.

Let's start with the good: The image quality is fantastic, and the 5.1 audio for both the English dub and the original Japanese are great.  That's about all there is good to say.

Now for the bad:  There is a problem with the English audio track simliar to the problem on the Season 1 Blu-ray set. This time, on Episode 4.  At 17:54, the line of dialogue plays in Japanese despite having the English audio track selected.  Batou is supposed to say ""Here they come!"" but instead it plays the Japanese line ""Kuruzo!"".

The subtitles on this set are only closed captions for the hearing impaired.  This means that sounds that play are given a subtitle like [feet shuffling], [door creaking], whenever they occur.  Further, the subtitles are ""dubtitles"", being a transcription of the English dub rather than being a translation of the Japanese dialogue.

The disc is authored as a single chapter for every episode.  This means that you can't skip past openings, previews, episode halves, or get to the Tachikomatic Days shorts easily.

None of the extras (interviews, making of) that were present on the DVD releases are included on this disc.

Due to all these factors, I can't help but be disappointed and consider this a sub-par release of one of the best anime series ever made. Ghost in the Shell deserved better.",1487030400,40,1404,4.681632653061224

8747079,3,B008CEQK1E,"Just finished watching ""Ghost In The Shell - S.A.C. 2ndGIG"" released by Bandai Entertainment.
There is a rather curious anti-American bias the permeates throughout this second series of the Ghost In The Shell prequel anime series that is extremely disquieting - even more disquieting is the  scene where the Major offers to have sex with a young boy in order to satisfy his curiosity about prosthetic bodies being able to function fully and how Japan is treating it's refugee problem - all due to the behind the scenes mastermind known as The Individual Eleven. Several backstories of the members of Section 9 are included in this second season, and at times it's not easy to watch. let alone comprehend why a course of action was taken.
Recommended, with reservations.

I don't write reviews but this release is so bad. Only the English Dub Subtitles not the actual subtitles from the original. Come on you could have at least ripped the subtitle track from Bandi",1527120000,,213,4.461538461538462

8747082,3,B008CEQK1E,"I've been waiting years for a good, affordable, high resolution release of this series. As others have said, they missed the mark here and on the first season. There are occasional bursts of Japanese during the English dub, and there is *no* option for ""signs in Engllish"" subtitles which is a very poor choice as several important plot points are conveyed through Japanese text on screen.

Additionally, episode 15 freezes and stutters in several places, and it's consistent so I don't think it's my blu ray player.

I think I'm going to have to rebuy this in the future, but I'll be much more careful.",1513036800,,603,4.733333333333333

This can be very annoying since minor details could affect your understanding of the plot.  There have also been times where they forgot to place the English dub and it plays in Japanese instead.  Video quality seems good but that is the only positive thing about this release.",1490832000,9,448,4.481481481481482
