8383208,4,B002WKE6Q0,I bought it for my grandkids to watch prior to a trip to Alaska.  Although I didn't watch it with them I was told they enjoyed it and watched it more than once.  They are ages 8 and 5.  My husband and I saw it and also liked it.,1375660800,,228,3.6122448979591835
8383209,4,B002WKE6Q0,"We are just starting to plan our first trip to Costa Rica and watched this with our 12 and 11 year old. It was a little cheesy at times, but pretty much like my own family would be on film. My kids were really excited to see some of the fun things to do, and made it clear they weren't interested in some of the things this family did. Not much beach time info included, but that doesn't take much research anyway. Overall this is a great start for a family trip to Costa Rica.",1357776000,,477,4.031578947368421

8383211,5,B002WKE6Q0,"I've been to Costa Rica 3 times.  All 3 times without my son in tow.  Last time, I went on an 'eco' adventure tour to the town of La Fortuna and liked the town so much, I started to seriously consider bringing my 4 1/2 year old back to visit and wondered if he was too young to participate in the tours.
Just by fortuituous timing, a friend gives me the Travel with Kids Costa Rica DVD and behold, all my questions concerning travelling with a young child in Costa Rica was answered.
My son and I watched the Roberts Family do zip lining, white water rafting, feed animals, visit a live volcano . . . the vacation filmed by Jeremy and Carrie looked so good and Seamus and Nathan looked like they were having so much fun that I decided when I take my own son to Costa Rica, I would follow their exact itineary!
This is one of the best things about watching the Travel with Kids DVD series~ another family have already done it and have done your planning for you!
Of course, I know every trip is not exactly the same and I'll have my own little adventures with my family when we go~ it's nice to have a reference for what to expect!
Thanks Roberts family!!",1303689600,,1154,4.217194570135747
8383212,4,B002WKE6Q0,We got this video to show our 5 and 8 year olds what to expect in Costa Rica. The video did a great job at getting the kids (and us) excited. I just wish it would have covered more areas as we are still trying to decide what places to visit when we go.,1277078400,,252,3.685185185185185
