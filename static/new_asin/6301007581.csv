This great review showcased the new stars of the period, and provided a kick-start to the careers of Joel Grey, Eartha Kitt, Alice Ghostley, Yma Sumac and others.

307658,3,6301007581,"Based on the Leonard Sillman Broadway show of the same name, this film showcases the talents of many new players who would go on to become household names. The excuse for bringing them all together was a show in  financial shambles that keeps going by featuring the daughter of a wealthy  potential backer. She is painfully bad in her brief appearances between  numbers. There are lavish production numbers and we are introduced to  Robert Cleary, Carol Lawrence, and Eartha Kitt for the first time. But it  is the comedy sketches written by Ronny Grahman and Mel Brooks that make  this worth seeing. Ronny does a marvelous satire of Truman Capote at a time  when no one knew of him. Paul Lynde and Alice Ghostley are the parents in a  take-off of Death of a Salesman with Ronny taking the Biff part. The twist  is that Willie Loman is actually a failed second story burglar who wants  his son to adopt a life of crime but the son is a straight arrow type. Very  Funny. One of Lynde's best bits is as an African explorer doing a slide  show about his most recent disaster of a trip. Robert Cleary sparkles in  several numbers, Eartha Kitt is at her sensual best, and June Carroll sings  ""Guess Who I Saw Today"". In total it lacks momentum but a good  fast forward will get you to some great bits.",931651200,17,1296,4.45531914893617

307717,1,6301007581,"It is unkind to say so, but this is possibly the worst variety show film I've ever seen.  Can't fault the cast so much as the director and the simplistic contrived story line.  Based on a stage version New Faces of 1952, the 1954 film version introduces the same dozen or more new actors, such as Eartha Kitt and Alice Ghostley who had achieved good success with their songs on radio.  But as part of the hokey variety show they appeared nervous and over-stressed.  Also, as a series of acts supposedly presented before a live audience, the lack of any applause or laughter was deadly.  Finally, as each new actor or actress came up for their skit, there was no mention of who they were, those new faces of 1954.  In the beginning and at the end the viewer is treated to a series of what look like ship's portholes with faces and names, but it was a lot to memorize, and it would have helped immensely to see the individual portholes as each act began.  As for the acting and dancing in general, think of an eighth grade PTO entertainment program and you'll about have it.

I give this revue five stars despite the poor quality of the recording.
Can't someone please produce a better recording?  Despite being
an uneven show, this revue has some brilliant numbers and some
brilliant performances.  Perhaps most importantly  it is a major ""cul-
tural artifact.""  What would American history have been  with-
out Eartha Kitt?  And who will forget Robert Clary singing ""Lucky
Pierre""?

The show abounds in material that by today's standards is ""poli-
tically incorrect,' but that is arguably a justification for classifying
it as a ""cultural artifact,"" a document that helps us understand
how different we were.

On the other hand many of the songs and skits are just as fresh
as they  when first introduced so many decades ago.

That's the stunning thing about ""New Faces,""  how  it still projects
uniqueness and newness because of the material  and because
of fine performances.

307776,1,6301007581,"New Faces Widescreen Edition was a real letdown for me, as I had expected much more from it.  I believe it was originally entitled New Faces of 1952 when it was done on Broadway.  My dad did not get credit on the 45 rpm album of the show, but he was called in to do musical arrangement on a couple of the numbers, including the entire arrangement of Boston Beguine.  I was in my very early twenties at the time, and was quite enthusiastic about the 45 rpm album, which I still have.

The DVD recently purchased looked as though a camera had been set up in the middle of the first few rows in front of the stage and left to do its own thing.

There were few if any closeups of any of the ""new faces"" and the movie, if one could call it that, looked like it had been directed by a first year student in agriculture, who started the camera and then went off to tend to the alfalfa.

The movie did not include all the songs from the original production.  Among those left out were ""Nanty Puts Her Hair Up,"" the Charles Addams sequence from ""Love Is a Simple Thing"", and ""Don't Fall Asleep."" Some of the performers, most notably Eartha Kitt, managed to be engaging despite the poor photography and direction, but it was an uphill battle.  One the whole, the music is good, the lyrics are clever, the sketches amusing, but don't look for goodness, cleverness, or amusement in the filmed version.

Eartha Kitt is not everyone's favourite and whoever transposed the film should not have assumed we'd rather hear songs from Eartha than the original skits that were cut.  I can't buy the tape as I have PAL in Australia or else I would buy the tape as another reviewer said the skits I wanted to see were on it.

307800,3,6301007581,"One of my fondest dreams is that someone, someday will be trawling the vaults at Twentieth Century-Fox and will find the negative or interpositives for ""New Faces,"" plus the original mag tapes for the stereo soundtrack.  ""New Faces"" was a Broadway hit in 1952; Fox had it filmed as a showcase for its CinemaScope process.  Over the years, the rights lapsed and the original elements were forgotten or mislaid or whatever happens to irreplaceable cultural artifacts in the Bermuda Triangle of studios' film vaults.  All we have of ""New Faces"" at present is this dreadful public-domain transfer, muddy and grainy and with wildly varying sound quality.  That should be terminal, but ""New Faces"" is so much fun it's worth putting up with every flaw of this release.  ""New Faces"" launched the careers of Eartha Kitt, Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostley, Carol Lawrence, Robert Clary and a number of other stars and writers; it's a considerable pleasure to see all of them in the full flush of youth, punch-drunk in love with performing.  Since ""New Faces"" was a straightforward filming of a stage show instead of the usual screen adaptation of a Broadway musical, the feeling of live performance is present.  It's a revelation to see a twenty-year-old Carol Lawrence capering and cavorting through ""Lucky Pierre"" with Robert Clary; it's nominally his number, but it's easy to see that nothing and nobody was going to prevent Lawrence becoming a star.  Surprises abound; Lawrence dances, and Alice Ghostley displays a fine singing voice, albeit one deployed in the service of high-camp comedy.  Eartha Kitt steals the show with several songs, including her famous ""Monotonous,"" and ""Santa Baby,"" not in the Broadway run of the show, but interpolated here because Kitt had made it so famous.  And even with the atrocious print and transfer, the cinematography (by Lucien Ballard), can be seen to have been wonderful once.  It's one of my fondest wishes that Fox will one day find this title in its vault holdings and give it a proper restoration and DVD or Blu-Ray release.  Until then, overlook this release's faults, and delight in a rare look at a classic Broadway revue.",1304035200,,2158,4.9805013927576605
307801,4,6301007581,"The only reason I bought NEW FACES (1954) was for Eartha Kitt. I read that she was one of the young singers/actors showcased in NEW FACES and so I had to have it.

The picture quality isn't too bad. The movie is in color and though there are a few tiny jump cuts here and there, and the picture isn't as sharp as say&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-Lucy-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B0006IUE0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love Lucy - The Complete Third Season</a>, which is from the same year or thereabouts, but for the most part it's watchable.

Most of the unknown actors making their appearance are pretty good in this feature like Alice Ghostley and Paul Lynde, who would go on to television fame as character actors, but Eartha Kitt and Robert Clary really steal the show!

Both sing and dance their heart out. Even though Kitt only has dance and song numbers, she really shines here. It's too bad they didn't have her do more acting in NEW FACES, but that probably had to do with racism more than anything else. Clary is funny as a diminutive French man and he sings really well.

Anyway, Eartha performs her standards like ""C'est Si Bon,"" ""Uska Dara,"" ""Monotonous,"" ""Bal Petit Bal,"" and the absolutely magnificent ""Santa Baby,"" which is worth the price of this DVD alone. She sings and dances up a storm and it's really something to see the ""Sex Kitten"" in her prime. No wonder Orson Welles referred to her as the ""most exciting woman in the world.""

The movie itself is built around musical and comedy sketches of the actors, so it's not a really strong storyline but it's fun to watch. I'd recommend NEW FACES to Eartha Kitt fans like myself or fans of Mel Brooks, who wrote the sketches.",1298332800,,1749,4.915254237288136
307802,4,6301007581,"NEW FACES is not really a ""movie"".

 Although it did play in theaters back in 1954, the picture is more of a filmed record of NEW FACES OF 1952, the hit Broadway revue from which it's adapted.  The film's producers have added a slight framing story, but what is on the screen is, essentially, a series of musical numbers and skits strung together, performed by the original cast.

 What made this stage production so memorable is that it was the vehicle that launched the careers of such stellar talents as Eartha Kitt, Robert Clary, Paul Lynde, Carol Lawrence, Alice Ghostley and Ronny Graham, as well as Mel Brooks, who wrote several of the skits.

 Frankly, with the exception of a sketch inspired by DEATH OF A SALESMAN that features Paul Lynde as a ""Willy Loman"" who makes his living as a pick-pocket, time has not been kind to the comedy skits in NEW FACES.  What might have been funny back in 1954 falls flat today.

 On the other hand, most of the musical numbers are still delightful, particularly ""Santa Baby"" and ""Monotonous,"" performed by the sultry Ms. Kitt, ""I'm in Love with Miss Logan"" (Clary), ""Penny Candy"" (June Carroll) and the melodic ""Love Is a Simple Thing"" (Carroll, Clary and Kitt).  However, my personal favorite is ""Lizzie Borden,"" performed by most of the cast.  It's a tune that I find myself often humming to myself.

 This new widescreen version of NEW FACES from VCI Entertainment has been digitally remastered and is the best available on DVD.

307830,3,6301007581,"OK, this ""movie"" isn't for everyone, but it's historical value can't be denied. It may be the first B'way show pretty much filmed in its entirety ... and the way it looked on stage. ""New Faces of 1952"" ran nearly a year and was the most successful of Leonard Sillman's many ""New Faces"" revues. (It was even briefly revived some 30 years later, with a different cast doing the same material.) Eartha Kitt was the show's breakout performer, but many other newcomers went on to memorable stage and tv careers, among them Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostley, Ronny Graham and Carol Lawrence (still a few years away from ""West Side Story."") In 1954, 20th Century Fox was still touting its new ultra-wide CinemaScope process and shot a number of offbeat projects demonstrating its diversity. (Among 1954's other Fox offerings was Otto Preminger's musical ""Carmen Jones""). The cast of ""New Faces"" was brought to Hollywood and the show was filmed, with a flimsy backstage plot added to tie the material together for the folks in Kansas. Five or six sketches and musical numbers were cut, and a couple of new songs added for Kitt, who had already become pop sensation. (She didn't sing her trademark ""Santa Baby"" and ""Uska Dara"" on stage.) The film was hastily made and may be the cheesiest-looking Fox musical of all time. It was a decided oddity when it came out (and I first saw it on screen at age 11.) The topical material (a spoof of Congress investigating jazz, or a jab at Southern ""degenerate"" literature) falls pretty flat now, but some of the stuff is still amusing (a spoof of ""Death of a Salesman,"" ""Golden Boy"" and other heavy-weight dramas of the time among them). The sketches have the feel of early TV programs, like ""Your Show of Shows,"" which isn't surprising since writers like Mel Brooks, who contributed to those, wrote for this show. The musical numbers fare better, though only two or three songs survived the show (""Love is a Simple Thing"" became Jack Paar's theme song on his ""Tonight"" show, and ""Lizzie Borden"" - the film's liveliest number - was a Chad Mitchell Trio standard.) Apparently Fox did not renew the copyright on the film and it's fallen into public domain. It's surprising any copies remain out there, but at least one print was found and a couple of DVD companies have used it. It's not a very good one; the color from the DeLuxe process has faded and shifted, and the film appears not to be entirely intact. It's been transferred to video in some ghastly process that cuts the sides of the full wide-screen image, looks out of focus and solarizes the blacks.(What did they do? Project the film and video it?). Also, the film was released in 4-track stereo and all you get is mono here.

Also, by making the lady who introduces each act the daughter of the show's backer, it seems to leave you wondering about ""he takes me off his income tax"".  In the play, she was ""a friend of the producer"".  The sound may be less than perfect, and the visual not the best, but for me it was a thrill to see all these great performers at the start of their careers more than 50 years ago.  By the way, for many years, Ronny Graham was a writer, consultant, and advisor for M*A*S*H on TV.",1209427200,4,1052,4.163366336633663

The video version, which introduces a silly plot and changes the order of the skits from the original, loses some of the original vitality, but enough is left to reward the aficienado.

307837,1,6301007581,~ fortunately i found New Faces of '52 on a VHS that was performed on TV. LIVE. Minus Eartha Kitt (thank God). Love it.,1197936000,,119,4.0
307838,3,6301007581,"I attended a Chicago high school from 1950 to 1954. A girl I was dating had an LP of New Faces of 1952 and we used to listen to it constantly; so much so that I bought a copy for myself. When the film version was released during the summer of 1954, I was a counselor at a YMCA camp in Michigan. On the only full day off that summer, we'd go to Lundington. Much to my amazement, New Faces was the movie of the day or week.
In watching and listening to the DVD I sang many of the songs along with the performers. Amazing that I'd remember most of the tunes after 55 years. But I didn't see one of the more memorable songs on the DVD that I'm sure was in the original movie. It was ""Guess Who I Saw Today?"" I wonder why?
Even thought the picture and sound quality leave a lot to be desired, the performances are wonderful and bring back good memories.
Eartha Kitt alone is worth the price.",1193529600,3,886,4.0397727272727275
307849,3,6301007581,"Paul Lynde and Alice Ghostley (""Bewitched""), Robert Clary (""Hogan's Heroes""), Carol Lawrence  and especially Eartha Kitt all made their initial impressions in this classic revue first on Broadway in 1952. Highlights include Ghostley, Lynde and Ronny Graham in a spoof of the Arthur Miller/Clifford Odets genre entitled ""Of Fathers and Sons"" written by Mel Brooks; Ghostley's solo by Sheldon Harnick, ""Boston Beguine""; Lynde's self-penned parody ""Trip of the Month"" and the grisly/funny hoedown finale ""Lizzie Borden"". The lame ""plot"" attached to the original (which had none) is hard to sit through and some of the performers are easier to take than others. Eartha Kitt's solos reveal how little she has changed in the past 50 years, at least in persona and material. But as one of the few records of the late-era Broadway revue, this is a must-see.",1191974400,8,849,5.1521739130434785
307850,3,6301007581,"One of my favourite films, it was lifted directly from the Broadway smash hit. I've waited long years for its release. An early Cinemeascope film, it exploited the increased width of field best seen in the full cast production numbers. This show launched several careers. Robert Clary went on principally to Hogan's Heroes. Ronny Graham appeared in several TV sitcoms and Mel Brooks movies. (Mel was a co-writer of the sketches in this show.) Paul Lynde made several comedy appearances as well as TV sitcoms and his own TV show. Alice Ghostley also went into TV sitcoms and movies, most notably ""Grease"". One of the revue's songs, ""Guess who I saw today?"", was delivered in a deadpan fashion but was to be picked up years later by Nancy Wilson who turned it into a stunning torch song. For me the star of the show was the then newly-discovered Eartha Kitt. She sings ""Santa Baby"", ""Uska Dara"", ""C'est si bon"" and the showstopper ""Monotonous"" which shows us why Orson Welles labelled her the sexiest woman on the planet. This DVD has been lifted directly from a mediocre film print with patchy colour, splices and some image and sound damage. Still, for me, better than no release at all.",1178928000,5,1187,4.739130434782608

I expected a new DVD of this 1954 film in a letterbox format and what arrived was a battered full-screen VHS which had seen long and hard service as a rental tape in some video store.

This is not serious enough to warrant litigation -- this grumble will cover the matter -- but it teaches me to read product descriptions much more carefully in the future.",1126828800,5,491,4.50561797752809

Eartha had only 2 solo numbers in the actual play. Since Eartha was a real SHOW-stopper additional songs were put into the movie version.

In this filmversion ( which is NOT the live version of the broadwayplay)

Eartha had much more to do, and so we can enjoy her ,singing Uska Dara in it, as wel as Santa Baby, C'est si bon, Monotonous and also Bal,Petit Bal ! Plus some singing together with the rest of the cast! well, THAT was for me worth buying it. The rest is not that good....it's really some short scenes and musical comedy waved together to get one play out of it, but to me this did not work at all.

This ""New Faces"", however, features a tacked-on movie ""plot"" concerning saving the show by getting a loan from the rich father of one of the performers.  In order to accomodate the addition of this throughline, several numbers from the show were edited out, most notably June Carroll singing ""Guess Who I Saw Today"" -- sadly, that number was the reason I was interested in buying the film.

This was the probably the best of all the Leonard Sillman ""New Faces"" New York revues and by happy chance it was filmed by Fox, possibly to show off the advantages of its widescreen CinemaScope process. The company was playing a tour date on the West Coast after the B'way run, I think, and Fox pretty much set up a few cameras and filmed it! Anyway, the studio never bothered to renew its copyright so the picture's been an ""orphan"" and the negative's probably been lost for decades.
