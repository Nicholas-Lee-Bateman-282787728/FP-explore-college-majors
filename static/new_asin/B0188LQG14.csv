7541656,4,B0188LQG14,"I was fortunate enough to catch an early screener of the film. I knew nothing of the film aside from what the trailer shows, so I went in knowing nothing.

I was beyond surprised at the film. Great story, great acting. A huge twist that I never saw coming. The film is one that you should give it a chance, you will be glad you did.",1452470400,8,332,4.03030303030303
7541657,3,B0188LQG14,"Decent flick, I was a bit confused as to what the purpose behind this movie was but I enjoyed. I was worried a few times that it was going to turn out to be a jesus-y type movie but then there were people cursing so I figured it probably wasn't. I rented it in SD so don't really feel cheated but I don't think this was worth the rental price for the HD version.",1456617600,2,362,3.9054054054054053
7541658,3,B0188LQG14,"Detective Ben Walls (Clayne Crawford) wakes up in a nearly abandoned hospital in Atlanta following an explosion. The first clue we get something is wrong is when the nurse talks about the upcoming Yankees-Browns football game. Ben ignores this but finds himself in a weird situation. He meets a guard named Peter Grayson, called Grace for short (Gary Grubbs). We quickly get the idea that this Twilight Zone has a religious theme, one that is explained to us at 58 minutes into the feature. However, if you read the plot description provided by the production for Amazon and IMDB, then you know this plot spoiler already. I was fortunate enough to watch the film cold, which made the mystery aspect a bit more entertaining, unfortunately not entertaining enough. The theme and acting was okay. The confrontations were mostly low key and the torture aspect didn't make a lot of sense. I mean you're dead already, where are you going to go, Cleveland? I liked the nurse Delilah character (Chelsea Bruland), but outside of that, you can keep the rest.

This is not exactly a faith based film, but a film that requires faith to believe. Not recommended for people who have surgery scheduled at Grady Memorial Hospital.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Do you really believe?",1456617600,2,1271,4.852534562211981
7541659,4,B0188LQG14,"I heard about Convergence on a podcast so I thought I'd give it a try.
TOTALLY love it - but its NOT horror! I'd call it more psychological thriller.

If you like mysterious thriller kinds of films then its for you, but if you're looking for jump scares and gore...might not be your thing.",1456358400,2,289,4.351851851851852

7541666,3,B0188LQG14,"Convergence is a supernatural drama set in a mysterious hospital. Detective Ben Walls (Clayne Crawford) lives a quiet life with his wife and newborn daughter, but hes called into action after an explosion at a local womens health clinic. The explosion may be the work of a terrorist bomber Ben has been tracking. While investigating the scene, another shocking event lands Ben in the hospital. When he regains consciousness, he is surprisingly uninjured and ready to go back into the field. But at the behest of his captain (Mykelti Williamson) and the hospitals eerie patients and staff, Ben is forced to remain inside the building.

Writer/director Drew Hall takes time setting up the plot. We get to know Ben and see how determined he is to close in on the terrorist bomber. The opening suggests a crime thriller to follow. When the supernatural element is introduced, we are already hooked on the pursuer-pursued plot. Combining horror with lots of stylized action, the movie is a textbook example of drawing on the most popular genres to attract a wide audience.

Performances are routine. Its the story that is the real star. Its the sort that the The Twilight Zone might have told back in the 1960s, but with more of an edge. Themes of faith, forgiveness, and grace weave through the story, which has a number of surprising plot twists.

Extras on the widescreen Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette, deleted and extended scenes, and a trailer.",1454803200,4,1461,4.930894308943089
8741727,4,B0188LQG14,"I find several of the reviews about this movie just...well, absurd. This is a pretty good movie with very good acting by the leads. It takes a while to develop what exactly is going on, which lends itself to the confusion the main character would be going through as well. What I find absurd is that people are obviously basing their comments on their own personal religious and political beliefs. This wasn't a propaganda piece done to impress everyone into becoming good christians or democrats. It was a blood and guts mystery/thriller that had religious overtones. Like...well, just about EVERY SINGLE HORROR movie ever made. Think about it. Ghosts, demons, monsters, zombies...they are all based loosely on our basis of religion in humanity. And they aren't trying to scare everyone straight. They are just entertainment. I am personally not religious at all, and I found this movie to be quite entertaining (although the musical score was too loud compared to the voice). Everyone PLEASE stop making everything about you and your beliefs and just enjoy a movie. I promise a thriller flick will not change your religion or political view.",1517702400,2,1143,5.021052631578947

8741730,2,B0188LQG14,"Clayne Crawford and Ethan Embry really commit here- and isn't it interesting to see how far Embry has come from his early typecasting as the goofy-but-nice friend? But beyond that this whole thing is a bit of a mess. A mishmash of ghost story, religion, mystery and more lacking any central point to gel around, particularly with a muddy and ambiguous finale that undoes most of the buildup. Ambitious but lacking in the focusing vision that might have made it a truly interesting genre bender.",1468713600,,494,4.823529411764706
