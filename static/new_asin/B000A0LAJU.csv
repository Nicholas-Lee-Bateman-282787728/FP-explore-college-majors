all of the grappler quest dvds i bought so far have been great. i would like to see them make some of not so well known competitors like perhaps a beginners /novices dvd to see how the guys/girls compete in thier first matches",1168300800,,336,4.1692307692307695
8144734,5,B000A0LAJU,"This DVD features so many Grappling and BJJ stars it's insane.  You get to see now BJJ Black Belts, Jeff Glover (Paragon) and Mike Fowler (Lloyd Irvin) battle when they were PURPLE belts.  Also, get to see Matt Serra (Ultimate Fighting Championship Veteran) compete in his first BJJ Superfight ever!",1153180800,,299,4.96
