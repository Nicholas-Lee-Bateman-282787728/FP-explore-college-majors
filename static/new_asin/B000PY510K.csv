2828839,5,B000PY510K,"WOW!  Nova really hit the mark this time with its cuttlefish video.  I asked my students to watch it on PBS and they were beaming the next day, full of questions and awe!  From the surreptitious smaller males who slip in and mate with the females while the larger ones are battling it out, to the small, walking (yes, walking) cuttlefish that will make you smile, but watch out, it's actually poisonous, these highly-advanced mollusks will make you think differently about invertebrates.  KUDOS to NOVA for making such a great documentary on a not-so-well-known group of animals!",1181260800,21,579,4.938144329896907

The cuttlefish is the most amazing sea creature.  They are shapeshifters.",1437264000,,141,5.619047619047619
2828844,5,B000PY510K,"It's a fascinating and informative movie about one of the coolest but not best known animals in the world. After seeing this on PBS, they have definitely become one of my favorite animals and I knew I wanted to own a copy.",1436227200,,222,4.309523809523809
2828845,5,B000PY510K,"My husband has this thing about cuttlefish and this video is just gorgeous.... short, but gorgeous.",1407628800,,99,5.25
2828846,5,B000PY510K,Again--I see design. How can this creature just make itself?,1404432000,,60,5.1
2828847,5,B000PY510K,I showed this is my elementary classroom after my son fell in love with it on Netflix. It is well done and fascinating. The kids all loved it.,1404000000,,142,4.107142857142857
2828848,5,B000PY510K,I love to show this video in my middle school science classroom and it makes my students a little obsessed with cuttlefish!,1399420800,,123,4.636363636363637
2828849,5,B000PY510K,"I haven't yet watched the DVD, but am sure I would be giving it a ""5 star"" being as how I saw the program on TV.",1386806400,,112,3.3461538461538463
2828850,5,B000PY510K,Great resource for teaching adaptations of animals. My 6th grade through 8th grade students enjoyed it and found it to be a great learning experience.,1385769600,,150,5.04
2828851,5,B000PY510K,"A simply fantastic documentary about the most amazing creature I HAVE EVER SEEN.  Really, who would ever guess that a show about cuttlefish (cuttle what?) would hold your attention for a nanosecond, but you will be in awe of the footage captured here and what this sea creature is capable of doing.  Just outstanding and fascinating beyond belief.  I know how hyperbolic that sounds, but see for yourself.",1384128000,,405,4.926470588235294
2828852,5,B000PY510K,Almost unbelievable creature! Great camera work. The dedication shown by these people to learn how it does what it does is wondrous!,1382486400,,132,5.045454545454546
2828853,5,B000PY510K,"""Cuttlefish: Kings of Camouflage"" is a Nova documentary about the cuttlefish, a creature related to the octopus and the squid. Apart from a lot of actual cuttlefish, we get to meet some of the scientists studying them, both wild in nature and in the laboratory.

The cuttlefish can change their colours and the texture of their skin in the blink of an eye, giving them near-perfect camouflage. The camouflage is a life and death issue for these creatures, since dolphins, sea-lions, sharks and humans love to devour cuttlefish, if and when they can get their jaws around one!

Cuttlefish blink like neon lights when hunting prey, almost as if to hypnotize the poor crabs and other smaller creatures that are on their menu. The mating rituals of some cuttlefish are especially bizarre, with ""cross dressing"" males (males pretending to be females) having larger reproductive success than the aggressive, more obvious males. Meanwhile in the laboratory, a team of researchers discover that cuttlefish pass elementary learning tests with flying colours. Apparently, they are also much better with lab equipment than octopi, which constantly try to destroy everything they lay their hands (or arms) on!

The documentary ends with experiments on the so-called flamboyant cuttlefish, confirming that it's toxic. This particular species is unique in another way, too: they are the only cuttlefish that walk on the sea bottom, rather than swim.

""Kings of Camouflage"" is probably a must if you love weird animals or strange stuff in general, and the footage is superb. It seems cuttlefish are just as exciting (or even more so) than their cephalopod cousins. Five stars.",1375056000,,1661,5.163568773234201
2828854,5,B000PY510K,"While Nova shows devolved over the years to pretty much stock footage, this one is a gem.  Very interesting creatures these cuttlefish, and this video has almost no stock footage.  You learn a lot about them--and only want to learn more.  I rented this 5-6 times until I realized I had to add it to my personal library.  Too bad most Nova episodes in recent years are not nearly as good.",1369267200,2,387,4.408450704225352
2828855,5,B000PY510K,This book is full of facts and information for kids to understand. Pictures are really good and descriptions also. Good book,1360540800,,124,4.9523809523809526
2828856,5,B000PY510K,I see these guys all the time while diving and I wanted to learn more about them.  Amazing video and well worth the price!,1358121600,,122,4.083333333333333
2828857,5,B000PY510K,We loved learning about this fish!  We might be nerds when it comes to nova because we love the show.  We have ages 7 to 57 years who watched and nothing but 5 stars all around.,1344211200,,177,3.888888888888889
2828858,5,B000PY510K,This is our absolute favorite nature DVD.  The cuttlefish rock!  Amazing footage.  This video is great for young and old alike.  Great family DVD addition.,1343606400,,155,5.08
2828859,5,B000PY510K,My husband and I watched this when it came on TV and it was so interesting and amazing that we ordered this dvd as a gift for my husband's parents. They watched it one weekend with our kids when they went there to spend the night and they all enjoyed it too. So we can vouch that this entertains from ages 4-52! We highly recommend this to anyone and we think it was definitely worth the $13.,1322179200,,392,4.103896103896104
2828860,5,B000PY510K,"This video was to entertain my 6 year old, inquisitive grandson.  He loved it.  But better than that was the whole family watched entranced as the cuttlefish became familiar to them.  Hard to find something that truly has adults and kids equally fascinated.",1322179200,,257,4.930232558139535
2828861,5,B000PY510K,"This video is the answer for people who can't or won't do drugs.  The abilities of the cuttlefish are quite frankly, something Dreamworks would have a hard time doing.  This NOVA show still blows my mind after repeated viewings.  If you like nature and like having you mind confronted with the seemingly impossible - buy this disc.",1320796800,,331,4.771929824561403
2828862,3,B000PY510K,"I love those cuttlefish, but there's something about the cheesy editing techniques that cheapen this entire episode.  Why do I need to see the cuttlefish researchers walking in speeded up motion through the halls to their offices?  Why do I need to hear a throbbing synthesizer whenever the cuttlefish puts on it's predatory light show?  The cuttlefish is an amazing creature, and it doesn't need any assistance from human post-production people to hold my attention.  I watched this once, but probably never again.",1298160000,6,515,5.168674698795181
2828863,5,B000PY510K,"I purchased this DVD mainly as a snorkeler wanting to view more underwater critters.  I was not disappointed.  I've had many interactions with reef squid, which are similar to cuttlefish.  The film presented some amazing footage of cuttlefish.  It showed scientists demonstrating how the cuttlefish are actually quick learners and amazingly smart for a water critter. When I snorkel with reef squid, I have always thought they were more intelligent than other sea life just because of the way they watched us.  At times I wasn't sure who was being watched more, us or them.  This film confirmed that the squids and cuttlefish are much more interesting than we'd originally thought.  Worth the purchase for sure.",1258329600,,711,5.077586206896552
2828864,5,B000PY510K,"My son came home from school one day talking about this video. Because of it, he now wants to become a Marine Biologist specializing in cuttlefish. He kept talking about it month after month, so I caved in and bought it for him. I wanted to see what the fuss was about (I mean, c'mon, cuttlefish?). The video was engaging and eye-opening. This is one incredible sea animal - it does amazing things with it's skin and body -  from the best camoflage I've ever seen to creating lit stripes rapidly running across it's skin to hypnotize prey. I would definitely recommend this video!",1246233600,2,580,4.576923076923077
2828865,5,B000PY510K,"Nova here has outdone themselves with their special on Cuttlefish. Marine biologist Roger Hanlon calls them ""a yummy hunk of protein swimming in the ocean"", and throughout this special astonishing images document the many ways cephalopods, unprotected shelless creatures, developed into the greatest of all nature's disguise artists. Watching these creatures' instanteous transformations as they move from one underwater envirnonment to a totally differing background is a transfixing spectacle. Yet this Nova feature is far more than spectacular state of the art underwater images worthy of the best of Blue Planet.

In less than an hour the show details the most up to date research on these unique creatures. We learn this class of molluscs have ""evolved large and complex brains compared to other invertebrates."" We discover how different are octupuses (solitary, anti-social) from cuttlefish (more social). For years octupuses got all the glory and study, they were easier to interact with, to anthropomorphize, as they would directly interact with humans. Today cuttlefish are receiving more and more interest, and as one researcher puts it, 'Am I smart enough to find out how smart they are?'

This show asks, and prompts questions. It's perfect for young people, and makes for riveting viewing as these champion color-changers captivate and amaze. Yet any adult will be humbled by such seemingly alien creatures - we don't have to travel the universe to find creatures strange beyond our wildest imaginings.

Nova supports this show with an outstanding website with each of the shows unique segements discussed in written text and images. The differing aspects of the cuttlefish and it's breathen cephalopods are nicely presented for further study and investigation.

A top education DVD that anyone can marvel at and enjoy!

Please Note! Nova only offers this for sale in regular DVD, perhaps because the emphasis is on bringing this show to the classroom. Yet the show also runs on television in High Definition: the leap in colors and detail amazes! If you can catch it in HD - don't miss it!",1225929600,5,2103,5.228486646884273
2828866,5,B000PY510K,I found this to be a very enjoyable nature documentary.  It has some truly breathtaking footage of these remarkable little creatures.  I would recommend it highly.,1217462400,,163,5.230769230769231
2828867,5,B000PY510K,"I love this video/dvd.  It is at a detailed enough level to interest high school students.  And they loved it, too.  I had them write essays after viewing it and I was very pleased with what they created.

My very picky students loved the video so much that the classes that saw it last were coming into the classroom asking, ""Do we get to see the cuttlefish video, too?""",1213315200,2,371,4.333333333333333
2828868,5,B000PY510K,This documentary made me wish I was younger and just entering college because I would go into marine biology just so I could study this amazing creature. Wow! You won't even believe what this animal can do. The cuttlefish truly shows how amazing nature really is.,1190764800,13,263,4.739130434782608
2828869,5,B000PY510K,"This was one of the most amazing NOVA shows I've ever seen.  I have a degree in Biology, and I'm ashamed to say I don't recall ever even hearing about these animals.  I, like many of its prey, was mesmorized by these fascinating creatures.  The footage was breath-taking, and the science of how they do such amazing things is equally so.  I couldn't stop talking about these fantastic creatures for days after seeing the show.  I would give 10 stars if I could.  I can't wait to own this myself!",1187654400,15,495,4.444444444444445
8193912,4,B000PY510K,Interesting. Nova usually well done did not disappoint.the show is some 10 yrs old answered the questions I had about skin augmenting but not much else. Its time for a follow up show to talk about all the intelligence experiments they were trying to design.,1522972800,,257,4.733333333333333

8193915,5,B000PY510K,This is a fascinating video about cuttlefish.  They are remarkable creatures which can change the color and texture of their skin very rapidly.  They can even make patterns ripple along their bodies.  And they appear to be as intelligent as the octopus. The video is very engaging.,1513296000,,281,4.9361702127659575
