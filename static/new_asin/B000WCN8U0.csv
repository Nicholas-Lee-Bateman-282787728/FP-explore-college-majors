8222682,1,B000WCN8U0,"I'm a huge MMA fan, and not at all opposed to watching regional shows with crappy production values.  I have dozens of such events on DVD.  However, this was absolutely unwatchable for me.  The reason being that the rules of this promotion (or perhaps the state) did not allow any strikes to the head except with an open fist (no kicks, fists, forearms, elbows etc.).  Couple that with the fact that the vast majority of the fighters had very limited technical skills (I believe most of them were legitimate amateurs).  I tried to hang in there and at least finish one full event, but that proved quite arduous (I scanned through all five events just to see if it was all open-fist strikes only - it was).  It's pretty deflating to see somebody get a full mount, but not be able to do anything with it because they couldn't apply any ground and pound and had no submission skills. Basically what you have here is a DVD set with many, many hours of slap-fighting and bad submission grappling.",1294358400,,991,4.53932584269663
8222683,2,B000WCN8U0,"The fighters get poor introductions as the fights just happen, you can't see their faces that well, and the fights mostly are on the ground (wrestling). It's not worth it. Don't waste your money and time.",1280707200,,204,4.694444444444445
