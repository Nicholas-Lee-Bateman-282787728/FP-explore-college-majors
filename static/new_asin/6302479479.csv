471488,5,6302479479,"My wife had been fed up with all of the legal dramas I was maknig her watch.  Being a third year law student she always netpicks the details.  But the story in this fil overrides the legal fallacies, making True Believer a great drama that centers around a lawsuit.",1140048000,5,265,4.387755102040816
471489,4,6302479479,"James Woods is erstwhile civil liberties attorney Eddie Dodd, his idealism long since forsaken for 4th Amendment violation-under-every-bed cynicism, & Rbt. Downey, Jr., is his summer intern (well, autumn intern) Roger Barron. Woods character based loosely on Frisco criminal def. lawyer J. Tony Serra.

Dodd's conscience-bending guilt submits to Roger's yuppie charm, & the two pursue the mysteries of why a young Korean gang member is serving time for murder & now's offed a member of some supremacist cult in prison. Woods's Dodd is light years beyond over the top with this, but an excellent supporting cast (Downey, Jr., [""...so we can get off guilty little pricks!""], Margaret Colin, Miguel Hernandez, & ""70s Show""'s Kurtwood Smith as a D.A. with a closet full of diced-up skeletons) & brisk dialog make him seem right @home there. To the paranoid, conspiracy-soaked veteran & witness to the original crime: ""Cecil, are you what heroes are made of?"" Cecil: ""I did two tours in 'Nam.""

If you can get past the new twist on the climactic courtroom scene & the veritable litany of continuity issues here, ""True Believer"" is one of the most watchable flicks I've seen---meaning, I can sit thru the whole thing without once hitting the pause button or pondering my full bladder.

The great scene in Eddie's kitchenette (with the de rigueur Chinese food) is especially instructive. When Downey, Jr.'s, Roger spouts armchair activist rhetoric (""We all think it's a good fight.""), Woods's Dodd lets loose with a tirade against bleeding-heart do-goodism that would make Bill O'Reilly cringe.",1112832000,23,1587,5.167315175097277
471490,5,6302479479,"James Woods was great as a burned out ""I'll give this job one more try"" kind of character who risks his life to discover a deeply buried truth, ""his client really is innocent"" and his career as an attorney is reborn. Too bad James Woods doesn't get enough parts in Hollywood but I suspect the bottom line is he is not part of the ""inner circle"" (he's a Reublican).",1111622400,4,364,4.2898550724637685
471491,4,6302479479,"James Woods has been one of the best actors in the screen. He is outstanding and always he commits in just five hundred per cent in all his performances. Powerful and expressive, but in Hollywood he has had just isolated opportunities. It's missunderstable.
Earl Dodd is very special lawyer, he isn't a typical image of lucky lawyer. and obviously our character lived with too much passion those singular decades from the sixties and seventies.
From this perpective a singular case challenges him; to assume the defense of a chinese acussed of murder, being not guilty. This movie will tell about all the resources and special methods of our antihero for winning this dark case.
Robert Downey Jr. plays the  typical role of the rookie naif lawyer who thinks the world is fair and clean. Soon he'll learn too many issues about how to deal with the life and specaiily in this business.
A well built script allows Woods to release all his stamina and skills, specially in front the Court in the first half of the film.

This is probably his greatest work (with Diggstown right there) and you will be able to experience his characters Frustration, pain, and relief right along side him.

471494,5,6302479479,"True Believer has to be one of the best movies ever made. The evidence I introduce to support my case is I have watched it 7-8 times without becoming remotely tired of it. (Raiders of the Lost Ark, another favorite of mine, got a little tedious after 3 viewings). True Believer is James Woods at his very best. The story is very plausible and the clues unravel at a perfect pace throughout the film. In fact, the movie gives you the opportunity to piece the puzzle together as the characters do. Robert Downey Jr., is the perfect naive ""sidekick"" to James Woods cynical been-through-the-grinder attorney. Kurtwood Smith is perfect as the district attorney. If you are a James Woods fan and haven't seen this movie you are in for a treat. Buy it!",1003363200,3,745,4.609022556390977
471495,5,6302479479,"As a lawyer who has been both prosecutor and public defender, I have to say this is my favorite movie about lawyers and my favorite James Woods performance. I get goosebumps every time I hear his speech about ...""the only good fight is one you win!"", said with the passion and spite that only James Woods has perfected.  His comment on plea bargaining, that ""..this isn't ... Yale, he [the client] doesn't care if we go down but go down nobly. He's looking at 40 years of hard time, and he bet it all on me!""  James Woods looks good with a pony tail, and the opening scene where his new intern, played by Robert Downey, Jr., mistakes him for the cocaine dealer is hilarious.  So is the scene where Downey tells Woods he is quitting because he is ""tired of using exalted legal principles to get off guilty little pricks"".  (I bet Downey was glad for those exalted legal principles in his own case.) I have to disagree with the comment that this movie realistically portrays the ""insidious relationship between police, district attorneys and their snitches"".  I wholeheartedly doubt that the frame at the heart of this movie is routine anywhere in the United States.  But the movie does say something meaningful about the tragedy that happens when good people with good motives go too far. I knew this movie was a touchstone when someone used Downey's line on me during a job interview where I was seeking to hire an assistant district attorney.  He didn't get the job, but I haven't forgotten him-and you won't forget this movie.",996537600,32,1528,4.637037037037037

Always did like the passion that James Woods brings to the big screen and this  installment keys in on his style of character as an attorney who is a liberal that bends the rules when needed, to get the job done.

Woods is an attorney who usually works on narcotic cases but was approached by a Korean mother to help free her son from prison and to prove his innocense of a murder.  Downey joins him in the pursuit of the mans innocense and shows how this is so involved.  There is also corruption and racial issues involved.  This turns out to be a good court case.

It just gets better from there. Lots of memorable lines in this movie ""Atilla the Hun had a mother OK"", ""I embellished, I embroidered, I lied"".

When he asks the Nazi where can we find this guy- hanging with a sign around his neck saying I betrayed my race on the great day of the rope - Woods - looking sheepish says ""anything along the lines of like, an address?""

It is Inevitabe than the sooner or the later you will see the picture of who you are in the present and who you were in the past. Please give attention to the way that the young lawyer appears, the scene with the mother of someone and the relationship between the leader lawyer and this someone.

It starts on a street where a man fires a pistol at another man. The crowd scatters. Next we see men in prison. They run in the prison courtyard, then sing in a chapel. A disturbance draws the guards away. One man attacks another, he is stabbed in the chest and falls. Next a man takes a taxi to a courtroom where a lawyer defends a man accused of cocaine possession. Does cocaine overrule the US Constitution? The jury says `not guilty'. This young man is from Michigan Law School. He sees old newspaper articles about Edward Dodd. There is another case involving drugs. Can he make a deal? Yes. Dodd counts his pay. Another client arrives for her son, accused of murder. ""You do cases cheap"" says the interpreter. Dodd specializes in drug cases which test the Constitution (entrapment, bugging telephones, etc.).

The new lawyer will handle this case he wants to be a criminal lawyer (to save the innocent accused?). Roger Baron and Dodd drive to Sing-Sing prison to interview their shackled client. ""What went down?"" They ask about his first crime, a gang murder. They do research on this case to learn more. A private investigator located other witnesses. One is in an institution. Is he reliable and credible? The police never called him. ""Who killed Kennedy?"" ""Lee Harvey Oswald"" he says. [They say 59% of the American people today believe in a conspiracy.] The Manhattan DA calls Dodd for a meeting at a restaurant. They talk about a deal. Dodd doesn't agree. A reporter talks to Dodd, there is a newspaper article. At night Dodd is attacked by a member of a Nazi gang. Phony teardrop tattoos? Dodd goes to visit the address and gets a surprise from the members of this gang, the ""Aryan Army"". Dodd visits his client and tells about the offered deal.

The investigation returns to the crime scene. Dodd visits the DA to tell him ""no deal"". Can they learn more about Chuck Louder? ""A good fight is one you win!"" The Prosecutor opens the tria. Gang warfare cuts back on tourism, somebody has to be found guilty to make an example. ""I read the Post"" says one juror. [Then a liberal newspaper.] The detective tells about the arrest. A retired detective testifies from his wheelchair. Dodd visits a machine shop to find his attacker. Where does he live now? But he won't talk. What about his family? Was he murdered to make it look like a suicide? An eyewitness identifies Kim. What did she see? The prosecutor has a surprise witness - a fellow prisoner. What will Dodd do? He talks to his client again.

Roger visits that machine shop to talk to a worker who visited the trial. ""You don't know anything."" An investigation into that shop owner reveals new evidence about his past.

Eddie had tried - succeeded then gave up swimming against the stream.  A young, idealistic associate comes to work for his hero.

472004,4,6302479479,"Eddie Dodd (James Woods) was a civil rights lawyer in the 60s and 70s, but has been reduced to defending drug dealers (4th Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure). Enter Roger Baron (Robert Downey, Jr.) who idolizes him from his activist past and wants to work for him.

Roger is in the front office one day when the mother of Shu Kai Kim comes in and, through an interpreter, begs them to represent her son. He has been charged with murder in the prison where he has served eight years for a crime he didn't commit. In fact, the killing was clearly self-defense against a member of the Aryan Brotherhood.

It becomes clear that the only way to get him off on the prison case is by reopening the Chinatown shooting for which he had been convicted eight years before. Dodd manages to do that, but finds himself in a very, very complicated and messy investigation in trying to uncover evidence that has been buried for eight years.

But Dodd and Baron are way smarter than they look. I did not guess the turn the case took until it was developed on-screen. If you like detective stories, crime stories, courtroom dramas, chances are you'll like this movie.",1336694400,2,1176,4.644230769230769

I credit that to the impeccable acting of James Woods (always underated) and the fast moving script along with the dry humor that he delivers so flawlessly. Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect, idolizing, naieve sidekick, paying his dues and learning from the master. Great entertainment in my book.",1316649600,4,564,4.686868686868687
472006,5,6302479479,"This is a surprisingly very good film. James Woods plays a pig-tailed, civil-rights, badly dressed, very eloquent, and very jaded lawyer who smokes marijuana and is prone to over-statements. A very young looking Robert Downey Jr. - it is 1989 - works as his admiring associate. They are approached by the mother of an Asian man who has spent eight years in prison for murder. She wants Wood to defend him for the recent murder in prison of a right-wing thug who tried to kill him. We see the event and it is clearly self defense. Downey persuades Woods to take the case, even though Woods hasn't handled a murder case in ten years. He spent the ten years defending drug dealers. Woods looks into the history of the Asian man and decides to file to reopen the eight-year old case. He finds a statement in the file that helps him get the case reopened. There was a witness who claimed that he saw the murder and it was committed by a non-Asian. Woods succeeds in getting the new trial, but faces several problems: this witness is clearly crazy, the prosecution has a witness who swears that she saw his client commit the murder, and forensics prove that the killing was done with the Asian's gun.

 Woods is threatened by a man who beats him up and tells him to drop the case. Why? The DA offers his client a much smaller sentence. Why? When Woods' client rejects the offer, the DA decides to try the case himself. Why? Woods finds a witness, but the witness is killed. Why? The trial drama is very interesting, but the DA is able to present a better case.  But then Downey sees something and everything turns one hundred and eighty degrees.",1299196800,2,1639,4.493288590604027

James Woods, pony tail and all, plays Eddie Dodd, an aging lawyer who, you guessed it, made a reputation for himself in the 60's as an activist, civil rights lawyer. Now specializing in defending drug dealers from ""The Man"" Dodd takes on a murder case at the request of a pleading mother who insists her son is innocent. With a solid supporting cast, True Believer is a satisfying courtroom drama/whodunit with just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. This may not be 12 Angry Men or To Kill a Mockingbird but it is one of Woods' signature performances and a must have for any James Woods fan.

472038,5,6302479479,"One more film about the corruption that is killing the NYPD and the District Attorney in that area. Then it is all a question of details. Gritty details. When you are working on a big business like the Colombian connection, you need informers and of course these have a price and that price is simple, total and absolute protection and impunity in their everyday criminal life.

In this very particular case there seemed to be some kind of family business that made the informer nervous and he had to kill some kind of boyfriend of his daughter or something and then cover up his crime by having the police arrest and have an other man accused, as long as he was not a Caucasian nor someone from his own band or gang and that's how a Korean was dragged into prison and stayed there eight years.

But the film is nothing so far. The point is how the defense attorney is going to get the truth out and his client out of the can. He has to force a couple of people into saying what has to be said and then he can trap the district attorney into revealing that the Korean was just the price to pay for the information about the Colombian connection. A pay off.

Then the film is finished and we can go home and rest on our beds with no fear. The most rotten police force and prosecuting branch of justice are watching over us and assessing who they are going to drag down into their nets to pay off some criminal for the little information he has provided them with about some cosmic scandal or surrealistic plot. That's when we regret not to be able to hitchhike our way out of this galaxy to go under another sun on another planet to sun our bones in peace and security. But that is certainly not in our beautiful cities.

Enjoy the film, the stunts are great though the stuntmen are a little bit passive.

It's a superb combination of murder mystery, courtroom drama, and redemption story.

472041,5,6302479479,"This movie is by far among the greatest legal thrillers I've seen, not only because the writing and directing are superb, but James Woods' acting performance is nothing short of spectacular. The variations he projects in his character expressions--with so many subtle nuances--make him 100% believable and fetching as that character. And when his sense of right is piqued, he explodes in the most compelling, absorbing, credible way--one which just pulls you another foot deeper into the story, kind of the way quicksand pulls you in: you just can't get out, nor do you want to.

In this story, the Woods character is fighting not only for an innocent man's life, a prisoner doing time, but even more important, he's fighting for his own life--his sense of self-respect, honor, and decency, none of which he feels in his earlier law practice while defending and acquitting sleazeballs whom he knows should be in prison instead wrecking society with their crimes.

I watched this movie a second time the night after I watched it the first time and got even more out of it. Buy it and keep it. It's far batter than most of the John Grisham legal thriller movies.

No question about it: James Woods is one of the most underrated actors today. He performed almost equally as well in ""Indightment"" the McMartin child abuse case.

472042,5,6302479479,"it takes all kinds, as I noticed someone thought this was boring.  Wow!  Clever dialogue, sharp acting, scary violence, moving innocence trodden under the heel of official corruption and cynicism,  if this is boring I have no idea what to suggest.

There are more good one liners in this movie than in a Fred Allen retrospective.  At the very beginning the young idealistic apprentice lawyer who has come to work with the great Eddie Dodd, mistakes the pony tailed defense lawyer for the cocaine dealer he is defending!  Boy is he embarrassed.

Later, when Dodd confronts the neo nazi brotherhood about whether they were behind his street attack, the guy with the rifle standing in the house decorated with swastikas says: ""if we were behind it, you wouldn't be here now"".

When the dirty cop points a gun at him, fires a round past his temple and sugests he back off, he slows briefly but says, scared but resolute, ""sorry guys, can't do it,  I've gotta be in court.""

You may not enjoy it, but i am a cheapskate with over 100 copied vhs tapes from the tube, and I am about to plunk down hard cash to buy this one.  Along with Witness, Fugitive, Don Juan de Marco, One Eyed Jacks, The Sting, True Lies, and a few others, this goes in my collection of movies to watch more than once.

The unappreciated reference above was to a scene where the mother of the innocent convict says: ""We asked everywhere for a lawyer to help us, and everywhere they mentioned your name.""  Oh?  says Eddie Dodd, genuinely flattered, ""What did they say?"".  She replies, ""They all say, you work cheap.""

And the brilliant bad guy DA is one of the classic hateable guys in film, the more than cold father of the kid who shoots hiimself in ""Dead Poets Society"".  i hope this is enough, not to persuade you, but to let you decide for yourself, whether to try it.

And I hope the bored guy above donates his copy to the library.  It is at least 4 stars but i gave it 5 to balance off the absurd 1 star  review just mentioned.",1174262400,3,1999,4.424657534246576
