8146367,2,B000IMVOQ4,"Technical content of this film is okay, the claims it makes seem reasonable, I've used EOs with some benefit for cleaning the air in my home.

I give a low review because this film is in essence an advert for Young's Living Essential Oils + Diffusers (any EO could do the job). I also drop a star in that the price relative to the hotel conference room with a camcorder production quality didn't seem to line up in my mind.",1333584000,4,423,4.2875

8146370,5,B000IMVOQ4,"I found black mold in the bathroom of my home in 2005.  I tried various ways to remove it (short of physically removing the building materials involved), but to no avail.  Then someone from our herbal study group showed this DVD.  I used the information suggested, purchased the Ancient Robbers oil (Ancient Wisdom's version of Young Living's Thieves oil), and it worked beautifully.

I used a diffuser to disperse the oil throughout the house over a 24 hour period of time.  The mold went away and has never returned; taking a lot of my health problems with it.",1220140800,13,562,4.6938775510204085

The DVD presents the results of numerous studies using essential oils (mainly Thieves Oil) which was reportedly first used by graverobbers in France during the middle ages to prevent them from catching the plague.  Could be a major scientific breakthrough in eliminating mold and associated health problems,1219536000,8,380,5.316666666666666
