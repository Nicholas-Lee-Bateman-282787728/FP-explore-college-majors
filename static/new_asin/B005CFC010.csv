8465299,4,B005CFC010,"I had previously purchased Halloween: H20, The Faculty, and Phantoms before placing the order and watched Children of the Corn V on TV and I loved them. I'm also a fan of Children of the Corn, so I had also previously bought a 20 film collection from Echo Bridge that had Children of the Corn 666, Hellraiser III and Dracula III in them. I loved all three and became a fan of Hellraiser and Dracula 2000. For that reason, I placed an order for this from the seller Round3, because I didn't have Dracula 2000, Dracula II, Children of the Corn V, or Hellraiser: Inferno and wanted them. The thing is, my order got cancelled. I'm entirely sure why, but they refunded the money. Luckily, after my order got cancelled, I found Dracula II, Children of the Corn V, and Hellraiser: Inferno in a Contemporary Cult Classics pack with Halloween: H20, Howling IV, Prom Night (1980), a Puppet Master film and The Ray Bradbury Theater. I had also found a solo copy of Cursed the same day. Even later, I'd seen Dracula 2000.

Anyways, I've seen all the movies in this pack and have every single one of them except Dracula 2000. I love ALL the films in the pack. I just wish Round3 wouldn't have cancelled my order, because have them all if they hadn't.",1428105600,,1237,4.4734513274336285
