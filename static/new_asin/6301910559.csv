7817385,4,6301910559,"An hour long Nazareth concert from the same era as the Snaz double live lp. Nazareth Live from London features a brief, yet energetic run through many of Nazareth's best known tunes such as; Rasamanaz, Hair of the Dog, Telegraph, Beggars Day, Love Hurts etc. Again an enjoyable concert, but I wouldn't spend a lot of money to acquire it.",1345334400,,337,4.633333333333334
