7508013,1,B017M3SSLU,"This is the most chaotic and ridiculous art film that I have ever watched in my entire life. The plot makes absolutely no sense, none of the characters are consistent, no one is introduced and they all seem to just come and go randomly. Literally the only saving grace of this atrocity is that the art style is visually appealing-- but even that is not enough to make this worth a watch. Don't waste your time on this one.

The rating is obviously inflated by individuals who were paid or who are invested in the movie someway.

The only reason I would watch this again was if the sound was completely turned off and it was projected on a large screen at a show.

Awful acting, a ridiculous amount of unnecessary screaming, and an hour and twenty minutes of your life you will never get back.",1452556800,7,792,4.410958904109589
7508014,5,B017M3SSLU,"Crazy Awesome!  Seriously insane! Very well cast! A must see! Visually stunning. The two line description and low star review given by Amazon left me no choice to find out more, I found this. Copy, paste, read, watch. https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/feature-film-funded-by-bitcoin-aimy-in-a-cage/.....because I cant put it into words and why should you listen to me?",1452384000,2,366,6.038461538461538
7508015,4,B017M3SSLU,"Aimy likes to dance. And paint. What's so wrong with that? Her family apparently doesn't care much for it, and her boyfriend only cares about working on his thesis he can't ever seem to finish. She ruins a doll belonging to her grandmother, which crosses a line, and grandma decides Aimy must go in for mind surgery. Not brain.... MIND. It's obvious from the outset that Aimy is not crazier than the people she's unfortunately surrounded by, but it's a case of incompatible craziness between them. You know, like normal life. They mask their annoyance with her creative exuberance by attempting to come across like they care about her, um, AFFLICTION. So she gets chemicals injected into her brain, and has to wear a really awkward helmet while she's healing. If anything, the medical treatment intensifies her resistance to her family's attempts to manipulate her into an acceptable member of society, and they resort to tying her up and restricting her to her room where she gets physically abused and made to eat awful food. She has occasional bouts of passive cooperation (which may just be dreams), but much of the time she spends screaming at everyone around the clock, and nobody gets much sleep. If that isn't enough to unhinge everyone, a deadly epidemic known as the Apollo Virus is raging uncontrollably in the outside world, and it's just a matter of time before members of the household succumb to fatal illness... though something about Aimy's mental state and alienation seems to give her an edge on being infected.

This beautifully shot, manically edited homage to anarchy is a loud, turbocharged and colorful labor of love... for the most part family-friendly (no nudity or excessive vulgarity), though much of the screaming and overall emotional intensity could be a bit much for the more sensitive types. Performances by the cast are mostly spot on, though Crispin Glover's character is (for him) uncharacteristically low-key. Allisyn Ashley Arm (with impossibly huge eyes) turns in a solid lead as Aimy, and is someone to watch for should she move on to more elaborate productions. Aside from some occasional dialog syncing and audio issues, the creators of this modestly budgeted film have mounted a handsomely executed production, tightly edited and never dragging for a moment, except perhaps confounding at times for viewers in need of more clarity. The music score stands out wonderfully, if overused at times, giving the film a cartoonish feel (that may have been the point), and songs by Joanna Wang are particularly delightful.

These are of course initial impressions from a single viewing. The decidedly unique, mentally divergent nature of this film will not be to many people's tastes, but the Ones Who Get It will of course be ecstatic. I personally look forward to further viewings, as well as disturbing numerous unsuspecting house guests with it. If you appreciate movies like Jeunet's Micmacs, Meet the Hollowheads and The Dark Backward, you can darn well make time for this lovely little cerebral detour.",1452384000,5,3043,5.047713717693837
7508016,5,B017M3SSLU,"Amazing concept, writing, vivid visuals and an intense pace that keeps you focused and on the edge of your seat for its roller-coaster 80 minute ride. A STRONG feminist piece with anti-authoritarian undertones perfect for the anonymous tumblr generation of millennials.",1452297600,,269,5.585365853658536
7508017,1,B017M3SSLU,"I guess this is supposed to be artsy.  You can start the film anywhere and it won't make sense.
There's no dialogue you need to hear.  The story apparently is an artsy girl who gets an operation
( bowl put on her head) to stop her from being artsy.  The End.",1452297600,5,258,4.019607843137255
7508018,4,B017M3SSLU,"I liked this movie. I found out about this movie well before I was able to watch it, and eagerly checked back in every once in a while to see when it might come out. I ordered it the first day. I'll admit, it isn't a great movie, but it's a wonderful visual treat. True, Aimy in a Cage is a case of style over substance, but it's not like there's no story to be found here. Some of the ideas are interesting, and given a budget and a bit lmore time to explore things, this movie might have been great.
As it stands, Aimy in a Cage was a blast, even if it was slightly underwhelming. There has to be credit given to Hooroo Jackson, for giving us a vision that was wacky, bizarre, and utterly original. I hope someone gives this guy a few million bucks to really flesh out a movie, but for now, Aimy in a Cage is a fine first film, one the cast and crew should be quite proud of. Also, what a great, gloomy ending. I'll probably watch this one again in the future. It's worth a second looked based on how unconventional it is.",1462665600,,1024,4.074257425742574
7508019,4,B017M3SSLU,"I have to admit that the only reason I watched this movie was because I thought the girl in the picture was totally hot, my kinda woman! After watching a few minutes of it, I realized it was a pretty good story. I liked the music a lot, too. Every character in this thing is weird as hell and the situations are outrageous! I thought it was a ton of fun.",1461369600,,354,4.0

7508026,5,B017M3SSLU,"This is the most brilliant movie I have seen in a very long time. In a fantastical, abstract, almost cartoonish style, the film deals with mental illness and the insanity of social expectations. If you're someone who likes the predictable rom com, you should pass, but if looking for something provoking and visually interesting, I highly recommend. I've seen it 4 times, and would watch again!",1454284800,,394,4.984848484848484

7508029,5,B017M3SSLU,"In the beginning of the film, it was very disturbing on how familiar Aimy's life was...many echoes of my early life...the grandmother's old dolls, the Merry Melodies, the paintings and artwork, the way the other people treated her and what they said to her, and the crazy world around her. But when I got to the end of the film, I felt a happy, almost giddy, relief that Aimy was at last free...through her perseverance, or stubbornness as some might say, she wins--free at last to be whomever she wants and to do whatever she wants.",1453680000,,533,4.5625

7508033,1,B017M3SSLU,"Terrible film. You could see that the director was trying to ride the wave of all of those recent alternative stories involving Alice in wonderland. It had that vibe about it except for the part about being good or original. I stuck with this movie until the end hoping that it would eventually reveal a direction or purpose. In the end, I wasted my time. It has neither direction, nor purpose. I still don't know what this movie was really about, and the ending was the worst part. It had the feeling of a rushed affair without even a modest attempt at making sense.",1453507200,2,567,4.461538461538462

8739709,4,B017M3SSLU,"This is one of those movies that you will either love or hate or be somewhere in-between. If this movie was made in 1997, critics might have called it a 90's movie. As it stands today, though, it is definitely described by critics as a 2015 movie. The theme is clearly an allegory of a metaphor. This is Crispin Glover's best performance as a gangster since the time he didn't appear in, or try out for, Boondock Saints. In fact, all of the roles here are clearly played by actors, which was quite the switch. There is a bit of flexibility to the definition of grandma in this film, which is the one and only reason it might be a bit off-puttish to some people. Also, a minor complaint, it started off one way, but it ended. To be noted, no  animals were harmed in the making of this film.

8739716,5,B017M3SSLU,"Whoa! What a trip. ""Aimy in a Cage"" is a hyperkinetic mlange of a film, which looks to me like bizarre influences of Edward Gorey, Jackson Pollock, Monty Python, Maya Angelou, George Orwell, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Barnum and Bailey, John Waters and other fringe artists. ""Crispy"" Crispin Glover is in his usual dark, but funny character. It is not the least bit surprising that Crispin Hellion Glover is such a big part of this carnival of madness. Assortments of theatrical oddities appear in an hallucinogenic stream that transfixes, intoxicates and amazes at the same time. Although the story line is rather thin, the visual parade of artistic and theatrical images stand-alone, making this film a curious piece of artwork that could potentially throw an epileptic into seizures.. If you need a clear, normal plot, or need a nice ""rainy day movie"", this is not for you, but for eccentrics like me, ""Aimy in a Cage"" is a treat indeed.",1475452800,,943,4.9
