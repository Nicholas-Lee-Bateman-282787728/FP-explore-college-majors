My other copy tried to power through the scratches and such that it had when I bought it, but gave up (I watched the heck out of it, so it was a matter of time). From the first time I rented it from Hollywood Video (RIP) to last night, this film remains high on my recommendation list for others, especially if they can relate to times having to sell CD's, pop culture referencing their way through the day, been through the throws of relationships personally and from surrounding friends, pesky phone sales people, and even yelling at girls in jeeps. Maybe I am bias because there are several parallels to my life in this film, but it is entertaining as well as thought provoking, as well as a bit nostalgic.",1526860800,,745,4.366906474820144
8324692,5,B0000633TU,The disc I received was damaged as well was the case. Completely not usable.  But I've seen the movie before.  It is awesome.,1413849600,,125,4.391304347826087
8324693,5,B0000633TU,"Chillicothe is a timeless, hilarious, sleeper classic - Wade, Shane (Bert & Ernie) and the rest of their pop-culture friends are true-to-life while trying to cope with life's after-college-what-do-I-do-now? hurdles.  Their 'wanna-be' lives with or without quasi-love relationships, the anti-climatic wedding, Princess Leia hair, Pavlovian dog-boy, the alphabetizing of National Geographics & the question of whether or not to watch movies with or without subtitles... It's all in there - just keep your eyes on the road!",1096588800,,520,5.753246753246753
