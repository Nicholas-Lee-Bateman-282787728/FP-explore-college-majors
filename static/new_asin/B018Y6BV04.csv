7559309,5,B018Y6BV04,100 episodes and extras together in two blu ray discs is the best.,1451433600,,66,4.153846153846154

7559311,5,B018Y6BV04,"Call me biased, but I've been following the Nerd since episode 5 TMNT! He had me dying for air as I couldn't stop laughing! And it was nonstop hilarity from then on out. He has grown a lot as a director, writer, producer, actor, haha he does it all! I can't wait to see what else James Rolfe puts out in his career. Keep it coming James!",1450742400,2,337,4.044776119402985
7559312,5,B018Y6BV04,"What a fantastic collection. As a huge fan of AVGN, I can't even describe how amazing it is to have the first 100 episodes in one little collection like this. I always held off on buying the DVDs because I just don't have room these days for a ton of extra discs. The fact that all of these episodes were contained on two discs, sold me, immediately, regardless of anything else. The video quality is about what you'd expect from YouTube, however, this set is far better simply for the fact that you don't have to deal with YouTube's cumbersome interface, ads, and the random pixilation that sometimes occurs during YouTube videos. The audio also struck me as being particularly good quality. I think the audio surpasses the YouTube audio quality, at least on my gigantic speaker system. The menus are nicely laid out, although, as another reviewer mentioned: there's a lot of episodes and I wish they had put more on each page of the menus, so there were less pages to flip through. But, that's a minor gripe for what you have here.

Some will think $50 dollars is a steep asking price, but you are getting 25+ hours of content here. It's a huge amount! If you don't own the DVDs or all of the DVDs, this set is a no-brainer. Even if you own the DVDs, this set is nice, just to have everything condensed to two Blu-rays. Disc 1 is a 50GB disc which houses 42GB of data. Disc 2 is a 25GB disc which houses 19GB of data.

Thanks for the great package, James!",1450569600,37,1457,4.392592592592592
7559313,5,B018Y6BV04,"As a big fan of AVGN who has missed out on the previously-released DVDs, I was glad I waited and was able to get this collection on Blu-Ray!

Let me just get some technical stuff out of the way right up front since it is important: While this is a Blu-Ray disc, the content is all in 480i Standard Definition. These are not HD, they're not even standard DVD quality (480p). They're also presented in ""Full Screen"" (4:3, black bars on the sides). It's not until the very final episode that the video format was switched to widescreen (16:9) and 720p.
The discs are region free according to the boxart. There are individual chapters for each episode and a play all option. There are no subtitles on the disc.
The reason these are on a Blu-Ray disc is that they can hold so much space. Disc 1 has 19 hours of episodes on it! Also keep in mind these were filmed for the web years ago in standard definition, so there is no HD version of a lot of this content.
The set comes on 2 pressed Blu-Ray discs (not BD-R's)

The Blu-Ray itself boots up instantly to the menu.
No waiting through company logos, just right to the menu screen. Awesome.
Options on the main menu are Play-All, Episode Select (8 per screen -- I wish they would have upped this number as you need to scroll through pages and pages to get to the later episodes) and Commentaries.

As of this review, there are 137 episodes of AVGN -- this Blu-Ray contains the first 100. I believe this is the first 6 or so previously-released DVDs combined onto a blu-ray set. There are a few more recent volumes out there and I hope they later get combined into a 2nd Blu-Ray set since the quality is higher. Maybe a new set containing episodes 101-150? I'd love to see it.

CONTENT: If you're looking at this set, you know who the Angry VideoGame Nerd is. This is the same content online, just packed onto a Blu-Ray set and loaded with extras.

CHANGES: Some content has been removed (for legal purposes?) -- games that previously had movie footage (such as AVGN #6: Back to the Future) have the movie footage removed. It's pretty seamless, but the review is more entertaining/flows better with the footage in-place.

VIDEO: As mentioned, episodes 1-99 are in 480i, episode 100 is in 720p. These are typically lower-budget DVD quality, but that's exactly how these were filmed. The video quality (especially on the early episodes) are higher-quality than the same videos on youtube. Game footage if where you notice issues the most -- these appear to be recorded on VHS, transferred to a computer for editing and then produced for the web. I won't mark the set down for these issues as that's how they're filmed and it's the best they've looked. Just don't go in expecting a Blu-Ray looking set.
Some of the extras are also in 720p (disc 2) but the quality seems to be high-compressed for online rather than a disc, so the quality still isn't too great.

Extras:
Disc 1 contains 5 commentaries:
AVGN #24 (Spider-Man), #31 (Bugs Bunnys Birthday Blowout), #87 (Ninja Gaiden), #92 (Game-Glitches) and #100 (R.O.B. the Robot)

Disc 2 is loaded with special features. I've heard there are 7 hours worth and I believe that. The ""Special Features"" option has 6 pages of extras
Some of these are a little weird like the ""Piece of Meat"" britney spears music video cover with AVGN cameos ;)
Unfortunately there is no Play-All option on the extras.  You can only view 1 extra at a time before it takes you back to the main menu and you need to navigate through the 6 pages of extras to find where you left off.
Hey James! You know what's BS? When a Blu-Ray disc is loaded with a hundred extras and you have to go through the list after each one to find the next one!

Also on disc 2 are a set of outtakes (19 of them, WITH a play-all option) - these run about an hour and 20 minutes total.

OVERALL: If you own the earlier DVD sets, you don't really need this unless you want all of the content on 1 disc. As far as I can tell, this content is all from the first 6 DVDs with no new extras added. Quality is also the same (except for a couple of the 720p pieces). The big benefit here is to get this set as a collection. 1 disc, 19 hours of AVGN.. and then another disc full of extras. Hard to go wrong with that. For that, I give it 5 stars.
The quality is iffy but it's also the best these have ever looked, so I can't blame them for that. It makes sense to load up a Blu-Ray (50GB) with content when a DVD is so limited (4.5 to 9GB).

As a big fan of the series who missed the earlier DVD Releases, I'm glad to have this. I wish they would've gone past episode 100 with this (since those are out on home-video) but I won't fault them for it. 100 episodes is a nice round number.",1450483200,82,4717,4.341657207718502

AVGN specifically is just great. These videos are a straight up great time, and nothing brings me back to a more carefree mindset than hearing that kickass theme song start up. Bliss.

This was an excellent, in-depth look at the SNES classic Earthbound that explored the game's history, shortcomings, and strengths (the ladder being pretty unusually for an AVGN episode).  The highlight of the episode for me was the trippy dream sequence that parodies Ness' dream in the game. The dream was hysterical with many callbacks to past episodes and features a child version of the Nerd who makes him question when he lost his innocence became so cynical. Not only did I find this part of the episode a fun treat for those familiar with the AVGN series but it was actually quite moving as well. The episode concluded with fan theories on the game's story and one from the Nerd himself which was very intriguing. This episode is double the length of the regular episodes but it does not drag and is paced well. All in all, I thought this was a great start to season 12 and I can't wait for more!",1524528000,2,991,4.5363128491620115

7559359,5,B018Y6BV04,"One of the best episodes yet and I don't say that lightly. I've been a fan of this series since the beginning, but I'm no starry-eyed fanboy as I've never been hesitant when it comes to sharing my honest opinion of an AVGN episode. If I like it, I will come out and say so and will list reasons as to why I enjoyed it so much. If I don't like it, I'll be just as forthcoming about it (His Christmas Episode with Keith Apicary, for example, is one of my least favorite AVGN episodes of all time regardless of the fact that so many other fans went on record to praise the episode). With all that having been said, I give this episode a genuine five star rating. The humor was reminiscent of the classic Nintendo Nerd without going balls-to-the-wall or over-the-top. James does a fantastic job of articulating his opinions and is fair in his assessment as he weighs-in on Earthbound's flaws as much as he covers all of its positives. I love Earthbound as it was such a big part of my childhood, but many people who also appreciated the game will oft times assume the role of the mega-ultra fan boy/girl and completely deny that the game ever had any flaws and will actively argue with anyone with a contrary opinion. Take Final Fantasy VII, for example...No, what we have here in this episode is a complete review of an amazing game that has its share of quirks and flaws. However, Earthbound's style, story, and charm all far outweigh any minor issues from which the game suffered. So, five stars for this episode.",1524355200,,1512,4.462093862815885

But over time, he's grown, not just in terms of quality and production value, but in tempering his humor with information, providing the viewer with insight into a hobby that he truly loves.

I'm looking forward to seeing where he goes with Amazon.",1524182400,,387,4.776119402985074

I could easily get it and see what it's all about and I think I will. I loved his depiction of the game and how he experienced it, and I especially loved the final fight scene when he goes through the theories of what it could have meant.

7559377,3,B018Y6BV04,"AVGN has been kind of going down hill for awhile now, there have been fewer and fewer legit episodes and they feel really half-arsed most of the time. A large chunk of their time these days seem to be used for normal reviews, advertising or ""let play"" videos.

It's no surprise, obviously they had to start branching out at some point to generate more content in order to be able to make this some sort of sustainable career for James and anyone else involved in his production. I won't fault them for that specifically, but that doesn't mean I still can't criticise James on the quality and production of new episodes.

It was cool to see James discuss Earthbound at length, although people who are aware of Earthbound already know how amazing it is. I would have liked it if he had taken the time to actually reviews all three of the games, since they paint a much larger picture of the series, the characters and the overall plots that spans three different generations of characters. My biggest concern with this review is due to the AVGN popularity, the prices for Earthbound will go even further into the stratosphere. The current prices going for Earthbound are absolutely absurd and unreasonable, the game isn't that rare or that valuable.

Anyways, I digress, the newest stunt James pulled with AVGN and having it release early on Amazon Prime is ballsy to say the least. If he wants this kind of marketing venture to actually be a success, he's going to need to focus on the AVGN series a lot more and release more than one episode every three months. I often completely forget about James and his content and then casually come back month(s) or sometimes as much as a year later to see what he's done.

It's AVGN. You know what to expect. And you can see it without having to pay for Amazon Prime.",1524182400,,1808,4.570987654320987
7559378,5,B018Y6BV04,"One of the best AVGN episodes ever.  The amount of time, energy, research, everything that went into this episode, it really shows.

He proved to the world that Super Mario Bros. 3, one of the most beloved video games of all time and continuously topping every best game ever made lists, was actually a vessel for the Devil to allow him into peoples homes and into peoples souls. So how does he explain the phenom that Earthbound is? He plays the game!

As someone who never even heard of Earthbound growing up and only learned about it within the past 10 years or so, I was also perplexed as to why Earthbound flopped in the US once I had a chance to play it. At least Nintendo added it to the Wii U and 3DS Virtual Console, as well as the Super Nintendo Classic Edition so that more people can enjoy one of the best RPG's ever made.

I'm surprised to see him putting videos on this platform but I can only assume that, due to the nature of his videos, he is beginning to outgrow YouTube. I hope he is able to continue producing content that he enjoys producing.",1524096000,2,990,4.227513227513228

7559411,5,B018Y6BV04,"I've been a big fan of AVGN for years. I wasn't around during the original run of the first episodes, (I thought it was dumb) but I finally did start watching around 2009? Maybe 2010? Anyways, I soon realized I was opposing it for all the wrong reasons. My only gripe with him is his reviews of the LJN games. Alot of the confusion about those games could be solved with the manuals. Back in the day, game manuals were IMPORTANT. Without them, lots of times you would be stuck for hours, maybe even days trying to figure a game out. But not once during the LJN reviews does he mention this. And alot of the time, the manuals gave the backstory to the games.

But that's my only gripe to AVGN, otherwise I love watching his videos. I wait eagerly for when a new Nerd episode drops. And again, he hasn't dissapointed. This video is AWESOME, and is I think one of his best! Almost a whole new way of him doing vids. Not as much swearing, and more content about his feelings or impressions of the game. And for once he's gone on about the good parts of a game. Very refreshing.

Keep it up nerd! Definitely will support you here.",1524096000,2,1125,4.276995305164319

7559447,5,B018Y6BV04,"James Rolfe is, in his own small way, a real pioneer in digital entertainment. The AVGN series began a genre of video game reviewing that many have imitated, but Rolfe remains even as the imitators have vanished. The style of the reviews has changed from their origins. The character is less and less ""angry"" and more and more a ""nerd"" in that James puts more work into the history of the games. A big reason for this is changing tastes in James' audience, but I suspect marriage and children have also softened him a bit. One final reason is that there are only so many ways to make the word ""ass"" funny before he has to move on to another hook for the show. This move to Amazon Prime makes sense. Rolfe was on YouTube early, and as that platform suffers, he is moving on to another. I hope this agreement works out for him, as I have been following his work since 2007.

The only gripe I have about this is the video quality. If you're going to be uploading to Amazon Prime first, YT second, I expect the video quality to be top notch.. This is evident in the first episode premiere on Amazon Prime, Earthbound.. within the first scene of the video you can see the video quality is quite low, it also seems like it's sub 1080 (720?)... Maybe the jump to Amazon Prime could be your jump to 4k.. or 2k (or 1440 at the very least).. It almost feels like if someone ripped a video from YT and uploaded it to here on Amazon, that's what the video quality looks like, like it's a re-encoding of a video that's already been encoded/compressed before.",1524009600,4,860,4.375

Im an absolutely ecstatic to see that they are remastering the old episodes as well and i can watch them on prime and support James.

7559532,5,B018Y6BV04,"AVGN has been a momento of mine since I was a teenager... Im 26 now, but man, seeing all these episodes now settles it up for me! Im a big fan of AVGN, and so is my brother. Were such big fans, that we actually want to go and see James Rolfe (AVGN), and Mike Mattei at one of the conventions or whatever they attend some time! That definitely ought to happen eventually, but right now, Im getting hours of special features, and 100 episodes of AVGN to see from these blue ray discs, which is totally awesome overall!!

AVGN really is an amazing series. Its a little vulgarjust a bit, cause of the swearing, but it has absolutely superb moments that attempt to draw out humor in playing video games that have either bad design, bad programming, or overall high difficulty settings which make them unbearable to play most of the time, if not, then, all the time... lol...

James made AVGN have fantastic editing points in the overall thematic scenes for the episodes, and I have to mention too, that the acting really is fantastic... The expression parts really make this series phenomenal, and I can see why playing the role of AVGN would be a lot of fun for James Rolfe!

Mike Mattei seems to always pop in as someone in an episode or two during AVGN. He is the artist for the series, and is very talented at what he does. His roles are pretty amusing... the props that James and Mike have for the show are amazing.

AVGN, overall, is, and remains to be, one of the internets best leading historians for retro based video games and video game systems. Im extremely impressed by how well James sets the theme for his audienceit literally seems like he puts himself in place of his audience while he is in the makings of this series and other videos that get designed and edited by him... That would make sense too, since, if everything is edited and made by him, he really makes himself the star all the time, which is excellent!!

I hope James continues to excel and push for more episodes. Maybe Cinemassacre will even spruce up a new series or two! Thatd be cool...James Rolfe is very talented, and so is Mike Matei. Thanks to these guys, Cinemassacre, and anyone affiliated with it, we have the historian for retro video games that is better than any website article or newspaper article, cause its the filming of AVGN that puts the audience into the hype. Which is easier and more entertaining for all of us! Am I not right folks?!

Anyways, thanks you guys. Yall rock. Lolz.

7559540,1,B018Y6BV04,"I am not giving this product 1 star because of the content. I am a James Rolfe fan and love the idea of the first 100 episodes of AVGN packaged together. This is why I coughed up the $50 for this Blu-Ray. I am giving this 1 star because of the quality of the product. It barely even works. The first time I put it in a Blu-Ray player, an error message came up saying that the disc couldn't even be read. I tried several more times, and eventually it began to play. When I could get this thing to play it was plagued by skipping, lagging, and freezing up. The episode select feature is so glitchy it's practically unusable. Any time I tried to go to a specific episode or pick up where I left off the screen would either go black and return to the menu, freeze up, or at best it would start to play and then start skipping uncontrollably shortly thereafter. The special features disc works better. It will actually play, but it has already been discussed by other people who bought this how the ""Contra Memories"" special feature doesn't even work. I know, I know what everyone is thinking, 'dude there's something wrong with your Blu-Ray player,' right? Wrong. I tried this in multiple Blu-Ray players and it was the same result no matter where I tried to play it. Also, every one of the Blu-Ray players I have tried it in will play anything else without any problems, it only has problems with this. After all this aggravation, I returned it to Amazon figuring I had just received a defective copy out of sheer bad luck. I sent it off and received a haste-free refund (thanks Amazon)! But I am a fan, and I wanted this, so again I ponied up $50 for another brand new copy which I received in a few days. Disappointingly, I experienced exactly the same problems with this copy as well.

I contacted Screenwave Media twice with calm and polite messages. The only thing I asked them for was some kind of explanation of why this product is so glitchy and any help they could offer. I never even received so much as a courtesy response. I had never heard of Screenwave Media before and they certainly haven't impressed me. I don't see how their business can grow when this is how they do things. Put out shoddy merchandise that doesn't work at a high price, and then not respond to customers. I don't have a good thing to say about them.

At this point I am stuck with a worthless Blu-Ray that doesn't work and out $50 as Amazon no longer offers the option to return this.",1495324800,5,2467,4.372549019607843

Yes, there a peace or two of missing clips that you may have already read about. That does not bother me. Over all, I enjoy watching this set. Best future is able to pick what show I enjoy watching. I have not got into the second DVD yet! All one hundred shows are in first disk. There few games I don't recall Castlevania 3 being hard on Nintendo. There two path to choose from. One of the path leads to where you meet Alucard (Who's attack is the weakest but the longest range). Taking his path is the easiest path in the game to beat it! Other path leads to Sypha, who's weapon is the strongest but shortest range.

I enjoy the nerd review about the history of learning about other game consults. I'm looking forward to seeing other DVD sets from the Nerd, and other interesting facts about other game consults and whatever history the nerd learns and want to share. Of course Best part is always watching what other interesting crappy games that came out. l think its festinating of him picking on the game Top gun and not able to land the plain.

There are some minor flaws, but these do not weigh up to owning a hundred nerd episodes on one disc. The technical errors as indicated by the top critical review are present on my version also. I do not care a whole lot, but I understand it can be a deal breaker for people. I have more of a problem with the rather ugly back of the box art and disc art; yes, I am that nitpicky. Also, I like the menu screens on the DVD's more than these menus, but I understand that these kind of menus are less time consuming to make than the traditional ones, as there is so much content. They are also not the most user friendly.

It is absolutely unacceptable to ship this Blu-Ray in this state. The Nerd's right arm is just simply too small; how this was overlooked is beyond me. Everybody I know laughs at me for owning a copy of this show on Blu-Ray, whenever I show it off they just comment about how small the arm is. This is simply disgusting. The Nerd's right arm should absolutely be as long and as thick as his left; to make the right one smaller draws negative attention from onlookers.

Look, I love the Angry Video Game Nerd, I've seen all of his episodes on the internet. But I just cannot get over the size of that god forsaken arm. God forsakes that arm. It is forsaken. That arm is a travesty; a disaster if you will. I don't even want to take the case off of my shelf because of the emotions that run through my brain every time I see the small arm. It is SMALL, not normal sized. It is roughly half as big as the other arm, and this is truly a disaster. One could even compare the tragedy to the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center, as the sheer DAMAGE that arm inflicted on American society isn't measurable. While thousands of lives were lost via the attacks, that doesn't even begin to compare to the MONSTROUS attacks that arm inflicted on my eyes. It's a disgrace.

I only have a few minor nitpicks:
-On the second disc (the one with the extras), you can't press down at the top of a menu to skip to the ""forward/back a page"" arrows. This makes going through those pages a pain, as there are a lot of them. Oddly, you CAN do this on disc 1.
-Adding onto that, there is no ""Play All"" on the second disc. There is on disc 1, thankfully.
-The Frankenstein outtake (the one where the Nerd sings the Muppet Babies theme song) has no audio. I assume this is due to copyright, but since the video makes no sense without audio, it might as well have not been included.
-Speaking of copyright, be aware that about a dozen reviews have been edited from the versions you remember on YouTube/GameTrailers. Most of the time it doesn't affect things too much, but the Back to the Future and Wayne's World reviews really suffer from the lack of film clips.
-Double Vision Part 2 has noticeable interlacing.
-The Contra Memories extra doesn't highlight properly on the menu. The only way I was able to play it was by hitting a random number on my remote.

Other than those minor things, this set easily comes recommended.",1453161600,6,2969,4.829076620825147

7559594,5,B018Y6BV04,"After stumbling through the first month of its ninth season, the Powers That Be at AVGN have suggested in interviews that the powerhouse comedy would be back on track with tonights Merv Griffin Show. While the characters of Ninja Gaiden and R.O.B. zoom into a pole position for spinoffs, the rest of this once-glorious comedy still has the schtick-shift stuck in second gear.

Having raised the bar to stratospheric heights  is there another show that has added new phrases to the American lexicon year after year after year?  it feels like a dogs age since the last multiplot show clicked on every cylinder (specifically The Pothole episode in which Mike Matei loses his Phil Rizzuto key chain).

The central premise here is brilliant: Ninja Gaiden finds the set of The Merv Griffin Show in the trash, reassembles it in his apartment and runs his life as a talkshow.

Gaiden's guests  The Nerd, Matei, Day Dreamin' Davey and animal expert Jim Fowler  mix it up well, following Ninja Gaiden's lead and then fighting against the bizarre logic of the whole concept; when Ninja refashions the show for a younger demo, results are a little obvious , yet well executed.

In other plots, The Nerd's dilemma is how to get new girlfriend Celia to let him play with her mint collection of toys from the 1950s and 60s. It has its moments. Uncle Fester is haunted by a sidler, new employee Walter who wreaks havoc by quietly attaching himself to her dealings with the boss. It gets old quickly.

Meanwhile, Mike Matei is doing battle with the agreement between wild animals and motor vehicles to always get out the way; when the critters don't comply, Matei runs into female trouble with current date Miranda. Its all too obvious.

In its quest to be about nothing, AVGN writers have stretched the tangents too far. The conversations don't have the logical randomness that defined the show in its earlier days when Ninja Gaiden was the curious interruption to the neuroses of Matei and The Nerd, two characters who have drifted into a meandering void. They lack purpose  Mateis run-ins with current and potential employers have been among the shows prime moments  and their dialogue is more comic one-upsmanship than a means to propel a storyline.

Ratings are stronger than ever, suggesting the American public likes what it knows rather than vice-versa. If ""AVGN ends this year, it might well be on a whimper, no longer fodder for the water cooler and described thus by its longtime fans: It was a great show that poked fun at all things urban and yuppie and then yadda, yadda, yadda, it was off the air.

8743314,5,B018Y6BV04,"James is a rare artist in a sea of people pushing content to simply generate views, subscriptions, and revenue. I've been watching him since one of my best friends showed me a few of his videos he downloaded in 2006. He's one of the few who values the story, the laughs, and the art that is cinematography. Once you finish this series and watch the AVGN Movie, make sure you watch his commentary and behind the scenes video. His special effects and camerawork are a fantastic throwback to the 70s and 80s style that brought so many people to the theaters and made cinema synonymous with popular media. This series eschews production value for engagement, CGI for laughs from the audience, and chasing the almighty dollar for having a fanbase who loves what he loves to do. I cannot recommend this enough.",1530057600,,804,4.669014084507042
