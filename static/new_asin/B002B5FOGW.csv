8360715,5,B002B5FOGW,"As part of her standard speech while running for VP of the Republican Party, Sarah Palin kept asking, ""Just what does a community organizer do?""  This documentary answers that question perfectly as it tracks this relatively unknown period of Barack Obama's life through the words, deeds, pictures and filmed sequences of not only all of the people that he worked with and supported, but also through his own words from a never-been-seen-before interview with Obama at that time.  When he decided to move to South Chicago to establish a base for learning how to work with and help others, many of the citizenry living there were initially very skeptical of this young 'Ivy Leaguer' entering their neighborhoods and lives with ambitions of creating 'change.'  He did this through coalescing all of the various religious, ethnic and political factions into one voice with specific goals and agendas.  His ability to listen to, digest and process all of their points-of-view, develop game plans to solve those problems and simply and effectively communicate what had to be done to achieve success became instrumental in quickly winning over those many 'non-believers.'  His consensus-building approach, collaborative skills and hard work always allowed him to deliver on his promises.  You witness his ability to introduce order, provide structure and develop all of his other organizational skills that allowed him to consistently gain more attention, respect and credibility in an ever-widening political mainstream.  You see a creative, conversant, convincing and compelling young man evolving into a political force while never waivering from the goals he sets for his constituency or compromising on the principals established to achieve those community goals (as most politicians conveniently do to enhance their own personal goals).  This is an impressive and informative retelling of how a young man with intelligence, principals, drive and 'a plan' can become a new force in the political arena by truly becoming an integral part of the people that he represents.  If the movie title ""A Star is Born"" hadn't already been taken, it would have been a perfect alternative title for this wonderful and informative retelling of the early years of President Obama's political life.",1250035200,8,2280,5.328690807799443

This is different from every other DVD I have or have seen on Obama. Unlike most other DVD's that focus mostly on his 2004 speech at the Democratic Convention and how he became President, this DVD focuses on his time in Chicago as a community organizer and how those experiences made him who he is today. The title is perfect.

I thought I knew about as much as there was to know about the President and his past, but  I learned new information after watching it and it helped me understand how and why he develops coalitions and consensus while pushing his agenda forward. Hearing his mentors and colleagues from the 80's and early 90's, understanding how and why ""Dreams of My Father"" was written and changed from the original concept and seeing what he was able to accomplish as a community roganizer reinforced my personal belief that we all can make a difference.

Although it's not one long interview but broken up throughout the DVD, I can see from what's call the ""lost"" interivew that the President developed a philosophy from his time in Chicago that he believed in and carried out in his 2008 campaign and beyond.

This DVD is not just for fans and supporters of the President, but an inspirational ""DVD"" that will fire you up about what each of us can do in our lives to make a better communtiy and a better world.",1249084800,9,1519,5.108870967741935
