BUT, honestly, I have to say this DVD set is AWFUL. I'm a trained, certified Fitness & strength coach professonal. I'm not allocating blame to any one thing or individual, but this material is terrible.

Funny thing is, Charles IS a first class trainer BUT this footage is nothing like ""getting cut with glass"" or his appearances training pro athletes on other DVD titles.

As the title says, approach with caution. I was EXTREMELY disappointed.",1247270400,3,564,4.6767676767676765

8043449,5,B0006UMHFK,"I am a big fan of video instruction, especially since I am a visual learner. I developed my proficiency in both golf and tennis by watching the SyberVision golf and tennis videos. These videos teach your muscles the correct movements by showing an athlete with perfect form repeat fundamental moves. As you watch and listen, ""your brain analyzes the incoming images of movement and converts them to neuromuscular memory."" Without picking up a club or racquet, I have become an expert in both sports. I've never actually gone out on the links or the court, but I know if I ever do, my muscles will remember their expert training and people will think I am a pro. I figured if SyberVision works for those sports, the same principles should also apply to weight training, so I bought the three-disc set of weight training videos by Charles Glass, expert lifter, bodybuilder, and trainer.

If there is any secret to building huge muscles, it is training hard and consuming massive quantities. Since I had the training part down with the videos, I worked on increasing my calories by ordering some pizzas before sitting down to watch the videos.

Watching these videos was hard work! I could feel my muscles sympathetically respond to Mr. Glass pumping out repetition after repetition and set after set. After watching him bench press, I could feel my own chest tighten. My biceps unconsciously flexed as I watched Glass repeat curl after curl. I finished off two large pizzas by the time the first DVD was over, and had to nap an hour before starting in on the second video and another two pizzas.

In the first week of watching the videos and eating over 10,000 calories per day, I gained five pounds! My body seemed to grow thicker as well. After a month, my pants no longer fit, but I knew that some fat must also come with the lean, so I didn't worry about it. With time I thought watching the workouts might get easier, but I actually found it more and more difficult to stay awake as I sat on the couch and ate pizzas while watching the videos.

After half a year of training, I have gained 117 pounds. I have had to buy a new wardrobe several times and a new couch as well. I am much thicker all around, but mostly in the midsection. I figure I should start the ""cutting"" phase now to show off the new muscles underneath all the inevitable fat I've accumulated. I'm now looking for an appropriate aerobics video to watch while I sit on my new couch wearing my new track suit. In this part of my training, I won't be eating pizzas, but I will have plenty of water on hand, because if there's any secret to aerobics, it is staying hydrated and keeping an elevated heart rate. As I run out of breath more often now, sometimes just from breathing, I'm not too worried about the last part.",1147651200,3,2787,4.523809523809524
