8316945,1,B00015400U,Don't waste your money.  Alexander is so inept and this dvd is so bad it can't help anyone.  This is one of the worst kendo dvd / video out there!,1209686400,,146,3.8333333333333335
8316946,4,B00015400U,"It does a good job of going into what the sport of Kendo is today! I have no experience and I'm only just about to visit my first kendo class, but from what I have read (several books now) and have seen pictures of (both the intro to this video and in the books) this video is more focussed on the sport aspect of kendo than the art (justu-form) or martial way of this particular doctine of combat.

Pros:

-Decent summary of background and history.

-Shows several sets of the same techniques or strikes.

-Illustrates and explains armor and how to wear it.

-Great overview of the sport of kendo.

-Shows good examples of warm-ups and drills.

Cons:

-While for beginners, it doesn't show bowing techniques.

-Doesn't show any kata at all.

-Shows several ""advanced techniques"" which should be omitted.

-Foot positioning is a bit different than what most books show.

-Doesn't focuss on the ""-jutsu"" or traditional art-form.

-Doesn't discuss how the ""-do"" (the way) relates to life.

-focus is on the sport or ""point-scoring"" aspect of kendo.",1128729600,6,1046,4.770949720670391
8316947,1,B00015400U,"You can learn what not to do from this video.  The instructor didn't have the right skill or experience enough to teach.  Not to mention the poor quality of video.  I watch for about 30 minutes, and that was enough for me to pack it back and shipped it right back to Amazon.com.  Amazon.com charged me $17 for the return processing fee.",1102809600,,336,4.370967741935484
8316948,5,B00015400U,"Very well presented, thorough and accessible.

A great intro to Kendo with some very insightful advice.

This item is also sold in a different cover on Amazon as 'This is Kendo - d' so don't make the mistake that  I made of buying both!",1098662400,9,236,4.318181818181818
8316949,5,B00015400U,"A must see video. If you want to learn or improve your existing Kendo

Techniques, you need to own this video. It has g helped me in ways I couldn?t even begin to describe here. Just watch it for youself and you will be amazed.",1090281600,,227,4.044444444444444
8316950,1,B00015400U,"The quality of this tape is extremely poor.  It is pretty much just a home video.  The colors pulse, the audio is poor and there is an echo through the entire tape.
The quality of the instruction seems very poor as well.  The introduction to the material is very unorganized, unplanned and difficult to follow.  He is constantly going off track.
The shooting is all done inside a small space with no variety.  There are no graphical aids or close ups.  Much of the fighting is shown from the side, so you can't see what's happening very well.  It would be a lot better at an angle over a shoulder.
Finally, this video is more like having a short talk with someone in a bar about Kendo.  It's an ok overview, but it is seriously lacking.  I am going to try and return the movie.",1046736000,,777,4.303448275862069
8316951,1,B00015400U,"I purchased this video based on its association with a good kendo book that was written in the 1960s.  Unfortunely, this is a very bad video and it is very deceptive to think that there is a connection with that book although one of its author's is mentioned on the cover of the video.  The techiques displayed cannot even approximate proper kendo techiques.  In fact, this video may even turn people off from even starting kendo!
As a kendoist, it is a shame to see this available as an instructional video.
Please do not judge kendo from this video!",975283200,3,551,4.545454545454546
