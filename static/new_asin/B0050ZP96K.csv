The previous hypnosis training I had can't even compare to the depth of learning I got from this dvd set - you won't just learn about hypnosis, you'll learn how to actually use it in real life, with real clients based on years in the profession by the creator Cal Banyan, who also teaches the course and is in the dvd videos. I love that I have the training in dvd format because I then I can watch it again if I want to, and I tend to learn more things about it every time I watch it. I highly recommend this training for any serious hypnotist. It's probably the best money I've ever spent on hypnosis training.",1418688000,4,749,4.35
8452135,5,B0050ZP96K,"5-PATH is an excellent system for hypnotherapy.  It is a clear, systematic approach to help clients with various issues. I use it with almost every client that I see in my practice.  Even though I regularly utilize 5-PATH techniques and feel confident in them, I try to watch the DVD set once a year as a review. I learn something new every time I do! As I'm sitting down to think about my goals for 2015 and how I am going to accomplish them, one of the most important things that I will be setting aside time to do is to sit down and re-watch the 5-PATH 2.0 Hypnosis Training Videos!",1418688000,6,585,4.261261261261262
8452136,5,B0050ZP96K,"This is, hands down, the very best hypnosis class on DVD.  Cal Banyan proves why he wins all the awards from the NGH.  I love my 5-PATH 2.0 Hypnosis training set.  It is clear and I learned to first do 5-PATH this way.  One of the best investments I have ever made, ever!",1418688000,4,271,4.056603773584905
8452137,5,B0050ZP96K,"Important Note:  There seems to be some confusion here.  Just to clarify the previous review from Ken Hoffman the VHS tape set that Ken Hoffman is referring to is an older version that is no longer published.  That older set included a total of 10-VHS Tapes.  He seems to be comparing the description of this new DVD set which is completely different from the older set he has.  Cal Banyan has developed a new training program that is 20 DVDs, 4 CDs, and one Data disc.  This is the set shown on this page. This new program is called the 5-Path 2.0 Set. It is over 65 hours in its entirety. A full 5-stars will be my review.",1345680000,4,624,4.245762711864407
