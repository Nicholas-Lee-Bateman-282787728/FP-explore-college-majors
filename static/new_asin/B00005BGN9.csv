1422097,4,B00005BGN9,"Charles Bronson is a criminal who wants to walk the straight and narrow road, and be with his family. But his old associates in the drug market have other plans for him. So they sort of ""kidnap"" his wife and daughter in hopes the reformed criminal will do their bidding. A turn of events put the crooks to where they will have to trust Bronson to find a doctor for one of their injured commrades. Of course, they will keep his wife and daughter at their hide out as he makes his travel. Bronson finds a doctor and heads back to the hide out in a hurry, as he is given only a certain amount of time to make it back. His strange behavior has caught the attention of the doctors nurse who alerts authorities. What happens next is one of the most intensive car chases ever on film. Imagine driving at top speed on a MOUNTAIN road with French police chasing you on motorcycles. Oh yes, all the nice little hairpin turns, where one wrong move will send you over a nice steep cliff. Now imagine a strategically placed camera on the front of the car to make your stomach feel its worst as it shows the car coming near all those hairpin turns.  Loads of action and suspense. A good film to watch if you like crime drama's.",1057795200,,1213,4.273913043478261
7937280,3,B00005BGN9,"Nice pre ""death wish"" Charles Bronson vehicle with him in role as peace loving man with family being pulled back into his criminal past by way of crooked partners that he betrayed some years earlier.  This film comes off as more of a ransom film than a revenge film and Bronson is a little more subdued than usual but still delivers the goods. I bought this version because it was advertised as widescreen but it's really just a standard version
That's been cropped to appear to be 2.35 ratio (screen where Jill Ireland is 'grassing up' looks like it was from a different print) you can also tell for the title credits are too close to the black bar boarders presenting a cropped look.",1489968000,,685,4.524193548387097

Brief female nudity.

Beware: This 905 Entertainment DVD Release from 2005 is a terrible print of film to DVD. Being an old film and made in the foreign country of France, the print is dark in some scenes and the color enhanced.
  A more normal print for this 1970 film can be found from Quality Special Products Inc. double feature DVD release of Chino/Cold Sweat.  Still old looking, but much easier to watch.

Terence Young directed the James Bond 007 movies, Dr. No (1962), From Russia With Love (1963), and Thunderball (1965).

Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland were married to each other from 1968 until her death in 1990.

7937283,2,B00005BGN9,"A low budget Charles Bronson movie. He actually had considerable dialogue in this movie. Although, I like the movies where he is the lone, strong and silent character.
James Mason was the antagonist and did well in the character.",1419379200,,229,4.897435897435898
7937284,2,B00005BGN9,"Even with international acclaimed big name actors and shot on location in southern France, this film is so poorly scripted and acted - it actually hurts watching it.",1414195200,,165,4.928571428571429
7937285,3,B00005BGN9,"A couple of years before teaming up on The Valachi Papers, Terence Young directed Charles Bronson in this entirely disposable but rather enjoyable Friday nighter from a novel by Richard Matheson (has any writer ever had so many novels and short stories filmed in his own lifetime?). It's nothing special, but surprisingly entertaining if you're in the right mood, and offers the once-in-a-lifetime casting coup of Liv Ullmann playing Bronson's romantic interest. Yes, that's Ingmar Bergman regular Liv Ullmann in a Charles Bronson film. Just to make the casting even more memorable, you also get a bearded James Mason in a beanie sporting an ahtrayjuss Suvvern axescent as the lead villain of the piece, Jean Topart dubbed by Bond regular Robert Rietty and the inevitable Jill Ireland as an annoying rich hippie chick. It's a simple past-catching-up-with-man-trying-to-make-a-fresh-start plot as Mason and his gang of cashiered army gangsters try to force him into ferrying them to a drug drop by threatening his family only for him to turn the tables, but it's made with brisk efficiency, has a couple of neat plot twists and a display of some impressive driving along dangerous mountain roads courtesy of Remy Julienne.

There are multiple public domain versions of this title available (and Amazon are confusing the issue by lumping reviews for different issues from different labels together), but the UK PAL DVDs from Cinema Club/2 Entertain and Optimum are the ones to go for, boasting the best transfer in 1.85:1 widescreen.",1390608000,,1531,5.198380566801619

The movie starts by a harbor in France, one fishing motor boat arrives from the sea. The captain plays cards and wins. Back home he gets a phone call and hangs up. Its not for the police. Lights out, curtains drawn! [Who is Joe Moran?] There is a noise inside the house. A stranger talks to them, but doesn't say much. ""How did you find me?"" [Is this actor's voice dubbed?] There is a fight, Joe wins. But he won't call the police. Joe explains his past life in Germany to Fabienne. He was part of a criminal gang. Joe tidies up, nothing on the living room floor. They carry ""Vermont"" away. Fabienne is fussy about a clean house. On the return they find three old friends waiting. Ross asks for Joe's boat. Will he go along? Yes. On the sea there is a boat with a Turkish flag. Opium? Joe learns about his stepdaughter.

Fausto is paged at the airport. Joe sees him, then meets a courier. They go for a ride and stop at a isolated cottage. Joe can bargain with Ross now that he has a hostage. But something goes wrong! Joe wants to get a doctor for Ross. Katanga makes a decision but it is overruled. Joe leaves with Moira to get a doctor and quickly return. There is an exciting car chase on a curvy highway, then the car goes off the road! [The red car looks like new.] The situation changes back at that cottage. Katanga is now in charge. They go for a boat ride together. A flare gun adds to the celebrations. And so it ends well. ""I'm hungry.""

This was filmed in southern France at the port of Beaulieu-Sur-Mer (a fine place by the sea). The story of a gang that abducts people goes back to ""The Petrified Forest"" and similar movies from the 1930s-1940s. The cast seems chosen by a quota system. You may find it just about average.",1336089600,,1760,4.2792792792792795
7937288,5,B00005BGN9,"Charles Bronson delivers in this film. The 70's ""feel"" is there. A time before green screens and CGI. Time when stunts and car chases were filmed, not created. The atmosphere and scenery in the South of France was a nice touch as well.
