2886035,5,B000SK5ZKW,"After watching 4 seasons, I must say this is top-notch entertainment.  Other than the relatively weak main character actor, the son and new 'monarch', the acting is wonderful and refreshing.  Regarding missing disks, I have always found Amazon exceptional in standing behind the product.  I have had a number of defective disks replaced in various series with no questions asked and immediate shipping.  We're awaiting receipt of season 5 rentals, but this will be my next purchase.",1206662400,,482,5.220779220779221
2886036,5,B000SK5ZKW,I saw that there were some problems with missing disks in the DVD set but all of mine were there and it's great having the series at home.  PBS airing is interrupted for their very necessary pledge drives but it's become a Sat night date for my wife and I.,1206662400,2,256,4.12
2886037,5,B000SK5ZKW,"I love love love this show.  I first saw it on PBS and saw every episode.  I started collecting the DVD's one by one, but then my parents gave me the whole series for Christmas.  I gave the DVD's I had already purchased to a friend, who is now as hooked as I am.  I'm even planning a vacation to stay at the estate where the whole thing was shot.  If you try it I know you'll love it too.",1206576000,7,388,3.8
2886038,5,B000SK5ZKW,"Finally - the entire series!  Been catching random seasons, or portions of seasons on local PBS station - having the complete set is heaven.

2886040,4,B000SK5ZKW,"The series did suffer a bit in the last 2 seasons, which is why I did not give it 5 stars.

Basically, it is a series about an eclectic group of scottish highlanders doing odd things. The central character is the relatively normal son who moves back to the family estate to save it from financial ruin. You will be rolling on the floor laughing!",1194566400,15,345,4.3076923076923075

2886066,5,B000SK5ZKW,"Great BBC series! You will become part of each episode , You will find yourself in one or more of the roles portrayed . You can not,  I repeat, not guess what is going to happen next . You learn the value of standing firm in your convictions. Fighting for what is right . If you don't have any convictions that you can put your finger on you just might walk away with a few of your own . The best part , It is a clean show: sex was implied but not shown . You felt the strength of family and friends that pulled together no matter how tough things got. We got each season from the library, fell in love with the story and had to own it to watch over and over and share with friends . When you write a review, please tell me who your favorite characters. For the record, mine is Golly",1472860800,12,783,3.9556962025316458
2886067,1,B000SK5ZKW,"The series was very disappointing, the characters are weak, plots are childish and undeveloped. It was highly overpriced and a waste of time and money. While the scenery is beautiful there just isn't enough of it to keep you interested.",1472860800,2,236,4.925

2886088,5,B000SK5ZKW,"Monarch of the Glen is an excellent series. Its clean both in word with no graphic sexual images. The story line is of an old Scottish manor struggling to survive under a young laird as well as the small town near by. The scenery is fantastic and each episode story line will keep your interest. Their is drama as well as comedy mixed in and you will fall in love with the characters. As the series progress some of the character come into the series for alittle while then leave as others replace some of the long-time character but they ALL fit into the continuing story and those character you will enjoy and love as well as the originals. I plan on watching it over and over which for me I usually don't, once I see it one time I don't want to watch it again but this I will. Its not flashy but interesting and entertaining, each episode leaves wanting to see what happens next. Its well worth the money.",1440374400,2,908,4.315789473684211
2886089,4,B000SK5ZKW,"The dvds were as much fun to watch as they were when we saw the series on PBS.  However, the box said that closed caption was available, but it was not.  Since hearing is now a problem that was a disappointment.",1439769600,3,211,4.121951219512195
2886090,4,B000SK5ZKW,"For some reason with some of these characters, I feel like I'm at the corner of ""Northern Exposure""and the beautiful Scottish Highlands  I'm into the 4th season and really like it a lot. The main character is the land and castle Glenbogle itself and the owners trying to hold onto it. All of the main characters really add to the charm of every episode. There's also new characters that make their way into episodes which adds to the shows interest but doesn't overwhelm or confuse or take away from main cast. And of course, there's the constant tension between Katrina and Archie with Lexie and a few other females drifting into the storyline. The main reason Archie is back home as the new Laird is to help his father and mother and their ancestral home on the business end, so that the land and the castle doesn't go the way so many in the past have before. House rich, cash poor. Comedy relief comes watching his aristocratic Father's antics while his handsome yet brooding and constantly annoyed son never has full control over the happenings. Soon though Archie grows into his role and begins making changes - changes some aren't comfortable with. In the 3rd season, the character of Lexie their lively, flirty housekeeper and cook so far is proving more and more annoying as she is moody as she is quirky. Modern as things might be, an employee wearing tummy tops serving well dressed residents and her constant face making is distracting. There is little background info on where she comes from or how she found her place at Glenbogle except that she got away from her bawdy and pretentious mother who makes an appearance a few times in the show. Meanwhile as the show progresses, it becomes clear she does hold a torch for Archie and after one love interest drifts away, it appears his feelings for her start coming to the surface. At a certain point, Lexie and her constant insecurity which manifests as moodiness becomes taxing both on Archie and the viewer. Katrina as well has her own temperamental ways but aside from this triangle, all other characters are equally interesting and in most cases their backstories are creeping in - although so far, unless I've missed it, Duncan's 'backstory' whatever it is, hasn't. He adds so much to this show however! I'll continue watching because all in all it's a good show but hope they get and show Glenbogle back on her feet. The characters connected to the land etc and the new enterprises are interwoven into the fabric of each episode and keep things interesting and moving right along.",1439596800,,2547,4.723595505617977
2886091,4,B000SK5ZKW,very pleased,1439164800,,12,5.5
2886097,3,B000SK5ZKW,"It started out well. The characters, while certainly flawed, engendered some sense of connection with the viewer. Alas, the saga of Glenbogle and the whacky McDonalds, as well as the inept help that seemed to drift in and out of the various episodes, became totally laughable by the end of season 3.  The writing became childish, the acting wooden, and the plots remarlably lacking in any logic whatsoever. The worst characters, in my opinion were Lexi, Duncan, the ever-brooding Gully, Ewan the boy cook, and the clueless Molly. The scenery is stunning, as are the Scottish highlands locations. That is the plus.

Not wishing to give the plot away, as there are a few (very few) surprises, suffice it to say that by season 6, my wife and I were wishing it would just end. The lack of communication, planning and thinking among the characters was hard to bear. Actually, toward thew end, my wife and I were doing paraodies of Mystery Science Theater 2000 as we sort of watched and thought of the two robots and human watching dreadful sci-fi films and making up alternative lines. Monarch of the Glen was a ripe target.",1438732800,5,1119,4.733333333333333

2886102,2,B000SK5ZKW,"It's worth watching for the scenery. However, once you get into Season 4, it goes downhill. I fast forwarded through the AWFUL Season 5, 6 and 7, and only recognized a few of the characters. Beautiful scenery, but not worth watching after Season 4 because of new characters and very bad writing. And how AWFUL was the Paul character? Talk about a stiff, unnatural actor. He was painful to watch.",1437609600,,395,4.6571428571428575

2886106,2,B000SK5ZKW,"I had such high hopes for this.  The first season, as others have said, was lovely.  The scenery was the major reason for that but the actors were charming.  Then the series started a downhill run.  Why could these people not communicate directly?  It turned int a farce as mentioned.  Golly and Molly were the only two characters who spoke their mind.  And I also agree the decline was expedited by the departure of major characters.

How disappointed I am to see the BBC who traditionally distributes the best on television come up with this disaster.",1434240000,4,553,4.6875

2886110,5,B000SK5ZKW,"A little background first  ::This was the first british series that held my attention in years. I watched a few episodes over the next few months on my pbs station. These episodes were from the mid run of the entire series. I thought it would have been nice to watch this show from the beginning as I really enjoyed the uniqueness of the characters. One of the actresses I remembered from 20 years earlier playing a role in another british series. She was a real beauty and as she aged maintaned that beauty (Susan Hampshire). Time had passed as did the the conclusion of this series and that was missed opportunity for me to the follow a enjoyable series from start to finish. I Began ordering my dvds through Amazon and during a perusal session I found the show.( Ah Ha) Which I regretted missing several years earlier. I purchased the complete series my largest investment in dvds up to this point. It was a great investment.
The Series:  I knew nothing of Scotland except for the loch ness monster. The countryside locations were beautiful. Bits and pieces of the history of Scotland were introduced in scattered episodes. Traditions, culture , etc. A real learning experience without a tour guide. The premise of the show was the prodigal son returns to the family estate to save it from being sold off after years of mismanagement. This was not what the son had in mind for his career goals. He does return with no idea where to even begin the quest. Each character all interesting ,with different agendas agree to partipate in the modernization of this grand estate so it may become self subsisting. Each episode deals with the successes and failures of this endeavor. The personalities of the residents on the estate and local community are so diverse it creates humorous situations. One neighbor ,also of a great estate and friend of the family is played with great humor by Julian Fellowes (of Downton Abbey fame) . He is a real talent . Terrific actor ,writer and all round creative mind.
There is great character development throughout the series. The actors know their on screen persona and how far they can stretch .You become very attached to them. There is much humor but the show is not a comedy .New characters are introduced which keeps the development of the series going and interesting. There is such warmth and affection among the extended family who invite us to share the ups and downs of their every day lives. This reason alone keeps the show alive and full of excitement. The show does not play like a soap opera with cliff hangers. You do want to see the next episode to see how everyone is doing and are they any closer to the of saving this estate and keeping the traditions alive.
Its a very charming show that gives us a break from the turmoil of the outside world.",1429833600,6,2798,4.627766599597585

2886138,5,B000SK5ZKW,"I've been watching the Monarch of the Glen series for several weeks, limiting myself to just one episode per day. Sometimes I can't resist starting the next episode though... The magnificent Scottish Highlands is the best part of this series. Every episode features scenes of the mountains and glens and the loch as well as the interesting old castle. The Glenbogle Estate, which comprises more than 35,000 acres has been handed down through the generations, but the old way of life enjoyed by the aristocracy can no longer be sustained. Archie comes back from London to help the family through a difficult time and discovers that he has been made the new ""Laird"", so he never leaves. Instead, he becomes maniacally focused on obtaining the financial support that they need to make the estate profitable and repair the crumbling old pile.

A huge house which was once supported by an army of household help and groundskeepers is now maintained by an amusing and eclectic small staff of 3 - one housekeeper/cook, one driver/groundsman and one ghillie - the gamekeeper. Archie's father is a doddering old fool, hapless and hopeless about anything that doesn't involve fishing, golfing, puttering around with his toy train set, or drinking aged scotch whisky. Archie's mother is a lovely and charming woman, focused on her hobbies, particularly painting. They are resistant to change and bound with tradition, though supportive of Archie's attempts to breathe new life into the estate.

Each week, a new challenge and dilemma faces the clan. Though the action is occasionally cheesy and the dialogue somewhat sappy, it's always interesting and fun and frequently neatly resolved within that episode. I look forward to continuing to enjoy the antics and accomplishments of the Glenbogle clan. I did make the mistake or peeking at a few other reviews and the Wikipedia entry which includes many plot spoilers, and have since resolved to just enjoy the episodes as they come and not attempt to figure out how it all turns out.",1417219200,,2020,5.026865671641791

The son has moved to the big city and doesn't want the job, but when he realizes the dire straits his parents are in, he agrees to move back home and try and fix things.  Seven seasons later, the story never loses it's interest and the characters, although they do change occasionally, always remain quirky and interesting.  Comedy and drama combine beautifully!

What a fantastic setting! Scenes where the camera lingers on the gorgeous Highland scenery contribute greatly to the enjoyment of watching MOTG. The great soundtrack also helps. My only disappointments were that it's not available in Blu Ray and that major well-loved characters disappear abruptly and the story moves on without them. Nonetheless, the new characters and storylines are well-done. The appearance of Tom Baker in the last seasons is a treat, and the whole saga is wrapped up nicely at the end.

2886162,4,B000SK5ZKW,"I found this series originally on Netflix.  I use my tablet to watch movies while I am in the studio and before I knew it, I was hooked - having spent an entire Saturday afternoon and early evening viewing Season 1.  I agree with previous reviewers that the loss of the core characters so early was affecting.  I didn't want to watch after the departure of Archie.  That departure seemed so hurried, out of character and irrational.  I wish they would have just brought on another actor to play his role.  That said,  I stayed on through the final departure of Lexie.  Although by this time, one could see that the characters of Paul and Lexie had more chemistry in a 30 second bit than all the scenes but two of Archie and Lexie.  One being a moment when he dances with her and the second, the scene of their wedding vows.  In the end, one almost rooted for her to stay with Paul.

The first three seasons were incredibly engaging.  By the sixth, it felt as if the very heart was torn out - and with no further mention of Archie and Lexie - the series core for so long - this is just mind boggling.  Molly just seems to forget she has a son and daughter in law, and a daughter and granddaughter.  I hear in the end Glenbogle is sold and everyone just goes their separate ways - and further that they didn't bring Killwillie, Lexie or Archie back for the final episode.  I can't watch that.

I shall, on rainy days, revisit the first four seasons, maybe even season five, again and again.  The scenery is breathtaking - and one really does get lost in the story, the challenges and the hijinks!  One of my favorite scenes is the whiskey barrel rolling about the house.  Perhaps one day someone will pen a reunion and catch us up with Molly and Ghully, Archie and Lexie on the vineyard in New Zealand, the travels of Killwillie and the adventures of Duncan.",1400976000,,1856,4.358600583090379

What a delightful surprise to find before me, a wonderful light comedy. From the moment I saw Susan Hampshire, I was all in. The hook was set and yet, then I got the next great surprise to see Richard Briar.  It HAD to be GREAT.  I immediately knew I needed to see this series from beginning,  right through. I have told all family and friends to watch this fun series, as I force myself to look away from the marathon screening I run with new series'. They keep you guessing as to what will happen next as it is always changing. I fell in love with everyone in it.  And the character Kilwillie truly stole my heart. He is played by Julian Fellows,  writer of Dowton Abbey. And while the entire cast is wholly enchanting, I proudly admit that I am happy that Susan Hampshire's character was kept throughout the series. It was she that brought me in, therefore, I am tickled to have been able to watch her performance through the series. I only wish there were more seasons.",1399852800,,1140,4.369668246445498

2886167,5,B000SK5ZKW,"A more contemporary version of the current series on PBS, Monarch of the Glen is fun, dramatic, and engaging series about a similar family trying to make their way into the modern world and through possible bankruptcy. Through it all, this rag-tag of an exciting bunch takes us through legacy and lunacy with the hopeful end result that the house, hearth, community, and home are finally safe for the future. With great and enduring performances by a great and spirited cast--led by legendary and a favorite actor Richard Briers, and relative newcomer Alistair Mackenzie--even Julian Fellows himself plays a recurring role--as next-door Laird Kill-willie.

Also, the spectacular scenery of Scotland makes a person want to pack bags and head out there from the first season, on! The setting and environment was all truly breathtaking.

I never tire of the characters, story or the scenery.  A real bonus for me is that Tom Baker was my favorite Dr. Who and he comes in to the show as some of the beginning characters begin to leave and takes up residence in the family as if he has always belonged there. I will also comment the new people besides Tom that are brought into the show as the original actors go on to other things become quickly a part of the story and  fit very well.",1389744000,,852,4.053892215568863

2886182,3,B000SK5ZKW,"First of all, I have excellent hearing so my complaints are not due to that factor.  Most of the lead actors in this series felt compelled to broaden the Scot accent to the point of being unintelligible - particularly the actress portraying Lexie.  Add to this a sound engineer who couldn't keep the volume at a steady consistency so you have to constantly be turning it up or down.

Further, I found all of the characters one dimensional which resulted in being bored or irritated.  Duncan runs with kilt flying throughout.  He is portrayed as a bumbling dunce who never learns and is constantly putting plans afoul.  Susan Hampshire as Molly is a mature pixie - not a pleasant picture and rather a contradiction in terms.  Lexie struts, bounces, attempts a flirtatious way (which fails) with any and all in her path.  Maybe it would work if one could understand one in ten words that she utters.  Then there is the stoic Golly who lends nothing other than a silent, staring brooding stereotype of a Scot.  He too mumbles throughout.

The scenery is lovely but not worth this many hours of viewing.

Here is a sample of the language spoken so you have a frame of reference for what you're in for. "" Bine Uh Ja ""- Lexie saying  "" Behind You.""  ""Ay Ed Ugh"" -  Once again, Lexie saying  ""I do""

Juding from all the other glowing reviews I accept being in the minority but I for one would NEVER want to watch this series again - once was far more than enough.",1389052800,4,1456,4.454545454545454

They also forced the marriage between Lexie and Archie; absolutely horrendous writing. I couldn't take it serious. I think my eyes and ears were bleeding when he said ""I love you"" to Lexie. They make the worst couple, because they have nothing in common. Opposites may attract but these two are oil and water, sliding off against each other.

Huge changes occur, and it's not good. Side characters aren't well developed in contrast to the Ballyk characters which grew as the series progressed. This makes the show very unenjoyable and boring to watch after certain characters have gone.

2886211,3,B000SK5ZKW,"I've been streaming Monarch of the Glen for a few weeks now and have made my way through Season 5.  There are a few more ahead of me, but I've peeked online and read what is to come.  No surprises await me.

When Season 1 began, I was quickly drawn into the story and the lives of all the players with great interest.  Archie, the reluctant Laird, is a keen personality drawn home to a position he doesn't care to hold.  The family estate is bankrupt, his father is in denial of the problems, and his mother schemes to keep Archie back home.  Archie, however, is determined to make it a short visit and hopes to return to his overbearing girlfriend and entrepreneurship as a restaurant owner in London.

As the story ensues, he is sucked back into the world of his childhood and the ghosts of his dead ancestors who are determined to make him face up to his responsibilities (really there are no ghosts).  Events lead to just that - he abandons his life in London and roots himself back into his heritage.  His family and the staff are an eclectic mixture of personalities, as well as friends, girlfriends, and potential loves.  The first three seasons I thoroughly enjoyed, but as the seasons continued on, I found myself losing interest.

Archie's first love interest, Katrina, made a great angst-filled love story of two personalities clashing together, who were both too proud to admit their feelings.  When they finally do, the actress who plays the part leaves the show, and we are left with Archie once again seeking to adjust.

Lexie, the cook and housemaid, has her eyes on Archie; but, of course, the class separation looms before her as an obstacle.  Hector, his father, and Molly his mother, are wonderful characters in their own right.  The series focuses upon their intent to get the estate out of debt before the bank forecloses and forces them to sell.  As the series continues with its ups and downs of trying to save the estate, humorous and lighthearted stories continue to entertain. There are a few characters I grew to dislike, especially from the bank!

For some reason, I found the series losing steam toward the end.  Huge changes in casting and storyline occurred, and the blending of the characters you've come to love, suddenly unravel. People leave the show, replacements come in, and things change.  I think, too, I wasn't exactly overwhelmed over Archie's choice of a love interest.  For so long there was no spark between the two, and then suddenly he confesses he's loved her all along. The emotionless expression on his face gave me the impression he was settling rather than being head-over-heels in love, which is the story I would have preferred to see.  There just wasn't a spark.  It felt forced.

In any event, it's a good and entertaining series.  The Scottish history and heritage is an interesting watch.  The scenery is absolutely breathtaking and makes me want to visit Scotland the next time I cross the pond. One other comment, if you're not used to heavy Scottish brogue, the dialogue is sometimes difficult to understand.",1358467200,47,3070,4.736346516007533

Their are always people out there that think it should have tighter and more complex characters.  What they fail to miss is that this is a kind of highland romantic comedy experience. Most of us have ancestors who are odd at times and even strange but this pulls all of that together into a full series.  These episodes all relate to the theme of Compton MacKenzie's Highland Book Series and they are not only fun but at times seem to reach into our own lives as we sit back in our chairs and have a good laugh over some balmy Scotland weather at a castle on a loch.

What I got was something even better---a virtual trip to Scotland!

There is so much beautiful scenery that if you don't like the way the plot is going, you can just enjoy the view. Since I'm in the process of planting trees, I enjoyed the segments that had to do with the woodlands.

The plot is fun. There's a little bit of Scottish history thrown in for good measure. The accents can be a little hard to understand at times, but it doesn't take away from the story. In fact, I think I may be speaking with a Scottish accent now.  It's all a lot of fun. If you are looking for a serious story, this isn't it. When I try  to think of an American series to compare it with, I come up with a modern-day version of Little House on the Prarie done in Scotland, but then again, it isn't even close. These people are rich people 'struggling' to keep afloat. They neglect to mention that they have thousands and thousands of acres of land that they could sell at a moment's notice and feed their family, staff, and descendants for years to come. They can't do that of course, because it just isn't done. The land has been in their family for many hundreds of years. It's fun to watch what they think being broke means.

2886238,5,B000SK5ZKW,"The gorgeous northern landscape is an enormous, spectacular character in this Scottish saga. And of course, the Glenbogle manse is a major character of the story, from its rafters to its basement, it becomes the dream-home of many a viewer, the house we all wish we lived in (without the expenses). This series only improves upon further viewing, whatever the flaws of the human characters. I hesitated for years in making the commitment to watching this, fearing the twee. Now, I'm a Glenboglie, requiring repeat ""Monarch"" viewings every so often. The story involves a great deal more than Archie and his relationship issues, and the narrative evolves through each season.

The elder statesmen are an especial delight, pitch-perfect, utterly believable: Hector, Golly, and Kilwillie. Hector's love of malt whisky legendary; what a pleasure it would be to sip Ardbeg with the gentleman, amidst snoring terriers before a crackling fire, with a good storm blowing over the loch. Angus Lennie, as Kilwillie's butler, is perfection, as in his timorous, ""I'd rather be taken prisioner by a gentleman, than free in a world gone mad!"" The addition of Paul a character adds another dimension, with Lloyd Owen's fine acting. One can only welcome the ripe addition of Tom Baker to the wonderful cast! Alexander Morton and the fine Rae Hendrie are superb, pitch-perfect throughout as Golly and his daughter. Nuance is everything; the majority of the cast are pros who deftly make the stories believable. Don't miss the Hogmanay Special (Season 5, Disk 3), a real haunted treat, with ghosts, and Paul dealing with his inheritance. Later episodes are replete with another select ghost. As other reviewers found, this is a captivating experience that induces indolence and relaxation, highly recommended.

2886255,5,B000SK5ZKW,"This series captures the spirit of both the Highlands and of the three Compton Mackenzie books sometimes referred to as the Highland novels. Mackenzie has been described as the Scotttish Henry James but that does him an injustice- for he wrote a broader range of works than James and he was far more likely to use humor. Mackenzie did not think of MONARCH OF THE GLEN as a novel at all- he referred to it as a farce in his dedication. If you were looking for UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS then you would be disappointed for the story is intended to be light hearted and humerous, not a drama.  The series updates the stories by setting them 70 years later than the original works but the wonderful characters, wonderfully acted, are very true to Mackenzie's vision.  However, although this series is very well written the strain of translating that vision to a later time clearly shows at times.

Their is one drawback that jars the veiwer who falls in love with the characters. It is a defect not of Mackenzie, or the show's writers or the actors but of British Television economics: It seems that almost no British television program can sign an actor to a long term commitment.  In the first two seasons we (and Archie) fall in love with Katrina- who is then abrubtly removed in the first episode of the third season (she briefly reappears in the middle of season four- and serves as the catalyst for the event that serves as the emotional high point of the whole series - I do not want to give too much away). Then Archie is gone by the middle of season five- and Lexie departs at the end of that season.  From the way that this happens it is clear that these departures were not originally planned.  And this is a shame- we have grown very fond of all of these characters and cheered them on as we watched them grow.

Which is another thing about this series- this is not just humour in the highlands. The characters are very rich portrayals of very human people- and very well acted portrayals at that. The series, for all of its warts, is probably one of the finest series ever done on British television.",1290038400,23,2103,4.503937007874016
2886256,1,B000SK5ZKW,"I love the British ""Masterpiece Theater"" style drama series such as ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", so when I read the many glowing reviews of this series I bought it expecting to have another wonderful box set in that vein. But Monarch of the Glen turned out to be a huge disappointment.  For those who are expecting another series in the British tradition, the purpose of this review is to warn you.  There is nothing traditional about this show. It is a modern soap opera through and through.  Granted, it much more elaborately produced than typical in-studio soaps.  It is filmed on location, and the one thing the glowing reviews got right is the wonderful Scottish scenery and settings. It is even in widescreen, to better capture the breathtaking landscapes. I give a star for cinematography. But everything is downhill from there.

This series is more like a British version of the 1970's/1980's American on-location soaps like Dallas and Falcon Crest, with some notable exceptions. First, it moves much more slowly than those action-packed soaps. Second, the directing is inferior to those American soaps. Third, the writing is not of the quality of those American soaps.  forth, it does not contain the expert acting of those soaps.  The last is the worst flaw of Monarch of the Glen. Don't expect professional acting. The actors in this series are soap opera grade actors, and they display all of the shortcomings of that approach to acting. The acting is more in line with American daytime soap operas than the mega productions like Dallas and Falcon Crest. Most of the actors lack emotional depth or the nuance and insight needed to flesh out their characters.  The acting style is mostly flat, and when the actors do try to inject some spark and emotion, it turns melodramatic.

Another problem is the background music. Don't expect any hint of traditional celtic music here, as would fit the setting of this series.  The background music is often in the Kenny G. style of light jazz saxophone, which doesn't seem to fit.  There is also much slide guitar and dobro, which would be appropriate if the setting was Louisiana or Mississippi, but doesn't fit the Scottish highlands at all.  There are even spurts of wild heavy metal riffing that is totally out of place. And to make matters worse, there are interludes of that schmaltzy sythesizer music that permeates the daytime America soaps.

Finally, the characters are flat, lack-luster and two-dimensional.  The writers can't seem to invent an interesting or believable character.  There is a feel of trendiness to many of the characters. You will see hipsters running around in kilts! Walls of the rooms of some characters are plastered with photos of mostly ugly punk rockers, rappers or other trendy teen idols.  Rather cliche and predictable, even hokey at times.  The character who comes closest to being interesting is the the aging patriarch of the estate, who is supposed to be an eccentric millionaire, but ends up often being just too goofy to be believable.  And his wife is way too spaced out to be real.

I don't meant to dismiss this series out of hand.  I just want to warn lovers of the British tradition that this series will probably not be to their liking. Definitely do not expect something with a traditional British or Scottish feel. On the flip side of the coin, lovers of modern daytime soap operas will probably like or even love this series. However, be warned that even if you are a fan of the on-location American soaps like Dallas and Falcon Crest, you will probably be disappointed in Monarch of the Glen, because it is inferior in so many dimensions from those blockbuster American soaps.",1286928000,16,3677,4.871589085072231

Clean, funny, full of great character development, scenery and drama, I was hooked and hoplessly in love with Scotland! The further I got into the series, the better it got! While Archie's love life was a theme of the show, I didn't feel like it overtook the show, and when he chooses the right girl for him, I didn't feel that the show jumped the shark. In fact, I loved that they didn't overly romanticize his relationship in the manner of most TV and film--especially American made.
However, without revealing specifics, I must say that while the show didn't jump the shark with Archie's love life, it did come to a point where I decided not to continue watching the show--stopping midway through season 5.

Endearing characters, beautiful setting, creative storylines focusing on family, friendships, loyalty, and love make this a delight to watch.  The first 4 seasons are strong, but after some cast changes, seasons 5 and 6 are weaker, with no fault to the actors themselves.  The writers attempted to ""replace"" some characters who had left but were generally unsuccessful;  the one exception being Paul replacing Archie.  However, season 7 wraps things up nicely, and once you're hooked, you really have to watch the entire series all the way through, no matter what.  I couldn't help but think why more series such as this couldn't work on American television, the one exception being Northern Exposure.  NEX fans will love this show.  Watch and enjoy!",1260230400,2,803,5.076335877862595
2886286,5,B000SK5ZKW,This is an excellent product.  Only a small portion of these shows were shown on our local Public TV and they are fantastic.  It is great to be able to get the entire collection this way.  They are a bit pricey but well worth it.  This collection was everything I expected and more.  I was very pleased with the extra features because the American public has no other way to get to know these actors.  I highly recommend this product.,1257033600,3,434,4.3625
2886287,3,B000SK5ZKW,"I have watched five of the seven seasons of this series (there is a change of cast in the last two).

The cast is a first rate collection of characters: feisty lord of the manor Hector; charming upper crust wife Molly; rebellious son Archie whose title is thrust upon him; a castle full of eccentric family retainers.  For the first two seasons, the stories mainly involve their day-to-day fights and resolutions.  Outside visitors rarely come off well.  The 'city dwellers', such as Archie's girl-friend and business partner from London, are invariably selfish, conniving, scheming social climbers who are soon defeated by the 'honest values' of the country.

By the third season -- after Hector's death at the hands (or should I say paws) of his dog -- the series becomes a caricature of itself, not to mention cloying, contrived, and without the easy humor which characterized the first two.  At first, Archie (good-looking Alastair Mackenzie) flirts with all the girls and they fight over him.  In the third season, he marries exuberant housekeeper Lexie, who was delightfully confrontational and fun for two seasons, teasing all the boys and bringing them down a peg or two.  She becomes a shrewish, over-protective, jealous ball-and-chain.  Similarly, inexperienced houseman (with double-digit IQ) Duncan is cute and cuddly at first, but becomes simply foolish and annoyingly inept -- even dangerous.  In one episode he manages to get the castle bombed and its contents burgled.  In another he backs into a public van, drives off while it rolls down the hill and crashes into a tree, then blithely wanders off to let everyone else take the blame.  When he finds himself in a gay bar in Glasgow, his behavior -- no matter what the producers may think -- is offensive and stupid rather than humorous.

As far as the Laird of the manor is concerned, Archie rejects his role to begin with, charmingly so, but learns to love the broken-down old estate and gets the place back on its feet.  After marriage, he becomes stubborn, patronizing, snobbish, secretive, uber-macho, and deaf to anyone's problems but his own.  He unceremoniously evicts the estate's fifth-generation ghillie from his cottage to make way for a paying tenant, then lets him walk away when the poor man reveals that he has a debilitating eye disease.  Archie relents in the end, of course, but only after way too much unnecessary anguish and condescension.  Maybe there is something in the water, because even Archie's initially self-effacing half-brother becomes a pompous, overbearing know-it-all as soon as he sets foot on the estate.

The ghillie (wonderful Alexander Morton) is not only the sexiest sexagenarian on television, but the only character in this series with any real integrity or consistency.  The other characters only display those qualities by default, or when forced into it.

There are several important things wrong with Monarch.  First:  way too many class snobs and far too much 'noblesse oblige'.  Second, too many plots involving the 'education' of the upper classes, and lessons in humility taught by 'wiser' underlings.  Third:  too many episodes in which an injured party sulks and walks off in a snit, making everyone's life miserable in the meantime.  Four:  too many episodes in which Molly saves the day through some inadvertent knowledge of an evil-doer and a little blackmail.  Five:  WAY too many episodes when a character deceives everyone for his own purposes, only to be discovered in the deception at the last minute and learning an 'important lesson'.  Suffice it to say, there is a fine line between farcical situations played for humor and cloying incompetence.  All too often, this series does not know the difference.

The finale of the fourth season is a real corker, but it comes only after 18 of the most tedious, morally questionable, and predictable episodes of the series.  The finale of the fifth series just fizzles out, and all relationships ring hollow.  There is something decidedly not funny about three clan clowns replacing a father's ashes (in what is meant to be, I suppose, a merry little mix-up) with those from a barbecue pit.",1252540800,31,4162,5.036549707602339
2886288,5,B000SK5ZKW,"I have watched all 7 seasons via Netflix twice now and decided I had to  own the series.  I am a huge fan of many BBC series, but this one touches my heart in a way no other one does.  The characters are incredibly endearing, each with their own quirky traits.  The acting in top-notch, especially by Alastair MacKenzie as the young Laird.  The series did suffer when he left, but Lloyd Owen certainly grew on me as the new Laird and I came to completely accept and love him in the role.

I only wish I could give this series 10 stars. It is that good.",1244937600,7,552,4.11214953271028

If you like quirky humor; swift romances; bit of drama; tons of scenery then this is the show for you to get hooked on.  Personally, I didn't get why Ballykiss is linked with this, but Monarch is one program I wish hadn't been cancelled.",1244851200,,480,4.359550561797753

2886301,5,B000SK5ZKW,"Wow, how do I start??? Well, I found this show in reverse of everyone else. I have an addiction to PBS but never caught the show when it aired. I was looking through the british television section in borders and picked it up one day and said... hmm. I didn't buy it, of course, because Borders is overpriced. Still, the name stuck in my mind. Forward a few years and netflix has the first five seasons available to watch online. Well, two nights ago I started watching the series and have gotten completely addicted. So addicted that I've gone through the first season in two days. After that I had to order the complete collection. I knew it was in widescreen and I ""had"" to have it. This is an extraordinary series. The scenery is gorgeous, that acting is topnotch and the entire storyline is beautifully written. So, if you're pondering on whether to buy this or not then I would recommend that you watch the first season. Fall is love with Glenbogle and then order the series. The price that Amazon has for this series is incredible! So, treat yourself today. Stop waiting and do it!",1243641600,7,1087,4.522842639593908
2886302,5,B000SK5ZKW,"I happen to come upon the wonderful TV series back in 2001. Life happens so I never finished watching all of the episodes. Then recently I saw a travel show of Scotland that reminded me of this series. I absolutly love it. It's a down to earth kind of show about people in a community trying to save their home and the love they have for it. My favorite part of the series is the main setting, all of this takes place in a beautiful castle in Scotland.",1239580800,2,452,4.1477272727272725
2886303,4,B000SK5ZKW,"You will definitely enjoy this show!  It takes place in the highlands of Scotland.  The scenery is amazing.  the DVD features extras which tell you about the surrounding towns where the show was filmed, what the local real shops look like, what the towns really look like, the casts bio, etc.

This show follows the path and lifestyle of the young Laird: Archie, the main character.  He is the laird who runs the estate.

SPOILER ALERT:  DO NOT READ FURTHR IF YOY DO NOT WANT TO KNOW:

Archie, the Laird, eventually marries Lexie, the housekeeper.  The story has a cast of colorful characters.  My favorite is Gollie.  He is a little more serious, loves and respects the land.

This a charming non-materialistic story.  It begins to fall short when SPOILER ALERT AGAIN:!  DO NOT READ FURTHR IF YOU DONT WANT TO KNOW!!!

Archie leaves and never returns.  A new additional cast of characters arrive, including a long lost bastard/brother of Archie.

At about season 6 the story goes downhill.  Even more new characters are introduced and the old good ones disappear.

RESUME HERE:  You won't be disappointed with the first 70% of the series.  But don't waste your time with the last two seasons.  If you watch, you will know why.  It falls short of the appeal of the first several seasons in many ways.  The cast of characters for one is SPOILER ALERT:  DO NOT READ IF U DONT WANT TO KNOW!!

mostly new and some annoying new stupid twists to the storyline.

RESUME HERE:  This however, overall is wonderfully entertaining, each episode something happens which is resolved by the end of the episode.  So, you don't have to watch the entire series if you don't want to.

2886304,4,B000SK5ZKW,"Monarch of the Glen is a delightful escape into a lush setting, with an eclectic assortment of characters, all of whom are family, whether biologically or by having their lives intersect. The scenery is eye popping. It took a few shows for the characters to engage me, as Ballykiss Angel was still in my mind, but the cast grows on one.
Yes, the rich are different, even when they struggle to maintain a dilapidated estate in Scotland. For an hour, I can leave behind the present bombardment of economic woes and negative news bites for the soothing sites of Glenbogle Castle, its stunning grounds and its quirky inhabitants.
This is both a good buy and a great share, maybe better for people over 50. Heat up a cup of tea, set aside a few hours a week, and enter a charming alternate reality. Then get back to work!",1235865600,5,816,4.52027027027027
2886305,5,B000SK5ZKW,"Archie was not supposed to become the laird.  Older brother Jamie was destined for that position, but his untimely death in the loch put Archie next in the line of succession.  When Archie's eccentric father, Hector Naismith MacDonald, decided to avoid death duties, Archie, all unready and unwilling, was promoted.  What he found was an estate almost in foreclosure, a drawerful of unopened letters from the bank, a hostile but beautiful young school teacher, and an entire town depending upon him.

The views of the majestic Scottish Highlands alone would make ""Monarch"" worth watching.  Add to that a family that is by turns loving and dysfunctional, plus a domestic staff composed of individuals as colorful and unexpected as the family members themselves, and the result is a series to call forth laughter and tears.",1235001600,3,821,5.097014925373134

And of course Gully is here throughout all seven seasons. I am getting ready to watch season 7 and am already feeling very sad to say goodbye to Glenbogle so I had to buy the complete boxed set so that no matter what, it will always be at my fingertips. This is the best all around program I have ever watched simply because my spirits are so lifted after I see an episode. The characters are like nobody I have encountered before on the teli. Monarch of the Glen lifts me when I am sad and the sheer beauty of the Scottish Highlands will move you. I only wish that my Mom had been able to watch it with me.

2886320,5,B000SK5ZKW,"Monarch of the Glen, made for Scottish television and the BBC, is an engaging series set and photographed in the highlands of Scotland. For most viewers I suspect these highlands will be known (or not) from glancing through the National Geographic magazine or a coffee table picture book  It is a delightful contrast to many BBC situation comedies that take place in mundane urban settings and are burlesques of real life. In contrast, life at the Glenbogle estate seems almost real, you even want it to be real!  It is a series of  63 episodes distributed over 18 DVD's with many cast changes, gains, losses and returns, and by the last episode, few players in the original cast remain.

Monarch is the story of the fictional Glenbogle estate and seat of the MacDonald Clan. The like of  this series may have been made for American television but I have not heard of it and might not recognize it if I saw it. Monarch can be as bracing as a brisk early morning breeze coming off the loch. There are no ridiculous car chases, no hot-dry hillside rendezvous, no seedy side-street hideaways, no operating rooms, no phony explosions accompanied by flying bodies, little interpersonal physical violence, and few if any elegantly coiffed females whose acting is restricted either by the script or talent. Ocasonally we come across a bristle-faced goon who is a bad guy.  The stars of the series include many good actors with unfamiliar (to me) faces, and there is the always elegant Susan Hampshire who plays the reigning Glenbogle matriarch Molly. The Laird of Glenbogle, her husband Hector, and head of the MacDonald clan, is appealingly played by Richard Briers. Hector, always irascible, impetuous, predictably unpredictable and impractical, frequently a wastrel, is killed mid-series by an explosion he set to kill an overgrown pike he suspected of ruining his fishing in the loch. A character found through much of the series is the resident naif and court jester, Duncan, played by Hamish Clark. Duncan's antics, while amusing, can also be tiresome though he helps each episode move forward.

The Glenbogle Manor House around which much of the action is centered, is another of the series stars. It is real, architecturally interesting inside and out, and, for the series, in need of repair. Money, for the estate, is an ongoing problem, and many episodes deal with  financial stresses. The estate, over 45,000 acres, includes the loch, still and glassy or tossed by the wind, magnificent landscapes that stretch for miles, and moist, mossy, arboreal understories that are quiet as cathedrals. Crofter's cottages, humble, attractive, and real, are separated, often by miles of landscape. In this space, time, plots and sub-plots, and contrasting sets of characters come in and out of view as each episode progresses.

The series includes a number of love interests and amours and on occasion can border on soap opera.although most viewers will have little trouble identifying with the characters.and the loves won, lost, or pending. As the series ends, Golly, the highly competent and ever faithful Glenbogle ghillie and factotum wins his almost unreachable and nearly lost Molly as they face a hopeful future together.",1231632000,3,3221,5.062264150943396

2886325,5,B000SK5ZKW,"This complete collection offers 64 episodes of the best writing, fantastic stars, & the most beautiful scenic country imaginable. It's all in a small package of ""ONLY"" 18 DVDs. Why only?  After 58 hours of feature followed by great bonus material, you will want MORE. Do the math.  Cost divided by length, it's the best bargain for peak perfection of British Drama/Comedy available.

Archie, the inheriting Laird, decides to save the Glenbogle estate. Throughout the 7 years of episodes (you'll be glad you now don't have to wait a week between episodes), he finds help and enemies aplenty. He finds anguish and love. Some of the stars will die within the script, others will move on, and new characters will replace the void. It is never static, never boring, always lush for the eyes, and filled throughout will drama, laughs, and the feeling that you have been accepted into this MacDonald family of the Highlands.

Golly Mackenzie (Alexander Morton) is the gillie, and the anchor to Glenbogle land. He remains through all 7 years of production.  Susan Hampshire (Lady Glencora in ""The Pallisers""; also in ""The Grand"") plays Molly, wife of the original Laird, Hector.  She also lives with the program from beginning to end. She is dynamic. She is the queen of Glenbogle. Her costumes go from riches to rags depending upon her activity, but is always powerful and lovely.

Duncan and Lexie are two of the estate's hired help that become huge in the story as well as delightful characters played so well that they sometimes upstage even the scenery. Due to their performances, certain episodes were written around their character, and Lexie eventually _____________ even. There are other important characters that are removed from the story and you wonder how the series will survive without them. But it does, and seems to better itself with the aging process, like all good Scotch.

This DVD set is an investment, one you'll never regret, even after the second and third viewing. This seduction of cinematography was based upon Highland novels by Compton MacKenzie. And it is Alastair Mackenzie (Archie) that leads the cast during the first five years of glorious fame. It is British family television at its finest.  Scotland at it's most beautiful. Acting to perfection. Fun as a Celtic pub visit.  As magical as a wee fairy dance. 6 stars if it were possible.",1230336000,10,2365,4.934508816120907

As 1 reviewer noted, the last 2 seasons lost some of their pizazz with a couple of the main characters making an exit from the show. The viewer is left thinking, yea, it is time for this series to end. Nevertheless, this is one of my family's top 5 favorite shows.

The episodes are engaging with beautiful scenery and interesting plots about the daily lives of the castle owners and their staff, and the decisions they have to make with in their personal lives while trying to keep an expensive castle and acreage running and profitable.

Archie, the son, returns to help his parents run the estate. And the plot thickens from there with ideas like introducing wolves to the estate to attract tourists. Archie always has a slew of women interested in him and one of them finally captures his heart and they tie the knot. The drama of running the castle is interjected with humor and the crazy antics of the characters. A good mix of humor and drama.

There really is no American TV show to compare this to, it is simply unique and entertaining in a way Americans will enjoy and never see on American TV. If you're tired of the American, same-old plots and watered-down characters, give this series a try!",1227916800,7,1377,4.496

The quality of it was spotty at best...some shows and seasons were mastered from lower quality, obviously video-based intermediate sources. I wasn't happy with it. I figured the British version would be better, being made right from the original source materials...boy was I wrong.

So then I ordered this US Region 1 version, and I am so glad I did. The picture quality is beautiful. The colors are vibrant and the images are sharp and detailed, and the quality is consistant throughout all 7 seasons.

The other thing I must mention about the technical side of this DVD set is that this US set is presented in 16:9 widescreen, as the show was originally shot and intended to be seen. The British set has some 4:3 seasons, and some 16:9 seasons.

Monarch of the Glen was a wonderful series, shot in the Scottish highlands with beautiful scenery and unforgetable characters.

8205534,4,B000SK5ZKW,Love the series.  Didn't like when they got rid of Archie completely and traded in Paul.  When they started trading in some of the old characters for new in season 5 I was a little disappointed but still good.  On the one I bought I noticed that the second DVD for season 5 and 6 needed to be switched.  Not sure if this is just in the one I bought or if other people had the same problem.  For these two things I could only give it 4 stars.  Would love to have given it 5.,1513900800,,473,3.875

8205539,5,B000SK5ZKW,"Waited and waited until I could not wait any longer!  The wonderful characters of Lexie,  Archie, Hector, Duncan, Molly, Golly, Kilwillie  and all the rest of the stereotyped inhabitants of Glenbogle prick the imagination and draw us in to the joys and travails of their collective lives as the saga of the Glenbogle Estate unfolds.  It is funny, sad, it is poignant and frustrating....it is great.  Anyon who does not thoroughly enjoy it should "" Go raffle your doughnut""!",1506038400,,473,4.936708860759493
