4999542,1,B006JTN5VM,"Absolute garbage not even worth pirating. If you thought the Dante's Inferno anime was as bad as it could get, think again. Why do publishers insist on trying to milk the success of the Animatrix? None of these things ever turn out worthwhile beyond the occasional interesting segment. A full on movie based in a setting as bland as Dragon Age's was doomed to fail. Brace yourselves for that upcoming Mass Effect anime. That's sure to be a winner!",1334188800,12,447,4.670886075949367
4999543,5,B006JTN5VM,"I've never been 100% happy with how bioware handles their decision. But from everything that I have seen on this movie, I can say that it's nice change of pace from what the Dragon Age is used to. Not to mention the box looks incredible.
Just so people know. I have seen the Japanese version of the film. And I liked it.

The animation, other than some blotchy frames is a solid piece. Not to the level of the Animatrix, but certainly leagues beyond the Dante's inferno anime, and on par with some of the best of Halo Legends. The cel-shaded water color anime presentation is neat east meets west style, although the backgrounds certainly go for realism. The story it's self is a little rushed, and it feels like it's only purpose is to build up for the climax. The film doesn't spare any expense on the fight, which are filled with tons of crazy choreography and blood. Lot's of blood. It get's a bit silly about how much blood there is. The story, not wanting to give anything seems to be a sort of deeper take on the world Dragon Age which makes references that were vague in the games and makes them bigger instead of giving an introduction into the world like other animated films based on games have done.",1330560000,18,1211,4.430493273542601
4999544,5,B006JTN5VM,"I really enjoyed this movie, especially as I am a fan of Dragon Age.  There are two discs inside -- English and Japanese versions.  The movie's plot is really good with lots of action, intrigue, some good characterization, and even a bit of romance.  Though the action is anime style, the animation/artwork is less so which I liked...more realistic than cartoon-like. The main character is well developed, the rest  having ""personality,"" but not much depth.  If you are a fan of Dragon Age, I definitely recommend this movie.  If you are unfamiliar with Dragon Age, you might want to do a little research on Dragon Age as some story elements might be a bit confusing.",1485043200,,667,4.756521739130434
4999545,5,B006JTN5VM,"Geez, what can I say, the animation style does take a little to get used to but it is very entertaining to watch. While I say its not a great movie, it is worth watching, so far I've watched it twice, and just love the main protagonist Cassandra Pentaghast. Her character is just so different from so many other movies that try to make women strong, in this movie they make her strong not necessarily by physical strength or attributes but primarily on her mentality, she is a hard women. And continues throughout the entire film. Loved it.",1484611200,,540,4.520408163265306

4999549,5,B006JTN5VM,"The story itself is very good, which connects between Dragon Age 2 and 3, and understand more on Cassandra who is one of the key person in games. The only drawback is the art, which isn't so impressive. As a Dragon Age's fans, I'm pleased to buy this movie after all.

4999555,2,B006JTN5VM,"Plagued by problems.  One-dimensional characters with no real motivations, ""evil for the sake of evil"" villains who spew their plans into dialogue, inept ""everyone who isn't Cassandra"", and a barely existent plot.

Many instances of lore bending (if not totally breaking).  For example, **** SPOILER **** not only does Cassandra solo several scores of ogres and golems all at once, in every other lore reference (for example, the ogre battle in The Calling) ogres are noted as being very very rare. even during a Blight.  **** SPOILER ****

The painted backgrounds are nice enough, and the off-the-shelf effects are decent, but the actual animation is quite poor.  All three of these things are also completely different styles which is quite jarring at times.

As a fan of the DA world, I really can't even recommend this as part of a full-franchise run-through.",1459036800,2,863,5.035211267605634

4999562,4,B006JTN5VM,"A pre-requisite of this movie is that you almost have to have played Dragon Age II, AND Dragon Age Inquisition to really understand the point, as there are references to events in both games that only a player would get. You can still enjoy it to some extent, just not the way a fan of the game series might. That being said, it is not very often that a movie based on an RPG does anything to inspire, or even manage to promote a story line. Dawn of the Seekers, however, manages to at least give some insight into Cassandra and her back story. This is especially true if you played Inquisition with Cassandra as a romance option (which, I would think, almost every player has at least once).

The story itself, was actually very well told, and had a good pace. The animation, while CGI, was very nicely done, however the score could have used a little more. Had it been done by Inon Zur, the composer behind Dragon Age and Dragon age II, I believe it could have folded the story into the game a little better. Also had they acquired Miranda Raison (the actress behind the Game series) instead of Colleen Clinkenbeard to voice Cassandra, there would, in my mind, have been less of a continuity issue for me. Despite these minor short comings, I really did enjoy this little romp back into the Dragon Age Trilogy.... All in all, a well done piece of work, but again, more enjoyable for the game franchise fan.....",1454457600,,1412,4.4728682170542635
4999563,5,B006JTN5VM,"I am a huge Dragon age fan. I have played through all the games numerous times.

4999564,2,B006JTN5VM,"Very silly, not at all realistic (and my standards of realism allow for people riding on dragonback), a paper thin plot and some poor characterization. Oh, and the animation was bad. Like completely mediocre bad. It's a product that's an embarrassment to the name of dragon age.

But still, the action was pretty cool, and I'm a sucker for anything that promotes such a cool universe, so I'm being generous and giving this a two star rating.",1453680000,,441,4.7272727272727275

It somehow didn't feel like a Dragon Age story, possibly because it is more in a traditional anime style than what they use for Dragon Age.  However, it was still excellent and Cassandra fans who have played Inquisition will enjoy seeing how she got where she is today.

4999583,2,B006JTN5VM,"One of the few Dragon Age extended universe stories to fall short of the being worthy of the price tag. While Dawn of the Seeker is by no means a particularly bad film, it seems to conflict with certain events in the DA universe and takes more cues from anime than it does from Dragon Age (i.e. Obligatory school girl skirts for the female warriors, ridiculous yet strangely unfulfilling sword duels, awkward male companion is awkward, etc.) Would not recommend to any Dragon Age fan, but those not interested in the Dragon Age series may find it entertaining.",1430352000,,560,4.724489795918367

4999587,2,B006JTN5VM,"This was the cheesiest movie I've watched in a while.  The budget seems to have been spent on the animation and artwork and not story or dialogue.  At bare-bones it is somewhat faithful to the source material from the games, but the events are unbelievable at best.  Did you know Casandra was biggest hero in the Dragon Age universe?  The hero's from the games were impressive, but they didn't have the abilities of Super Casandra.  Able to fall off the highest peek, decapitate demons with a single strike, ride a dragon, crash aforementioned dragon into a bigger dragon, etc.  This was a hard watch from beginning to end.  As a fan of the games this was disappointing.",1427241600,2,670,4.6752136752136755
4999588,3,B006JTN5VM,"Fun for DA fans, probably not too great if you aren't familiar with the franchise. Highlight is watching Cassandra slay dragons; lowlight is forced chemistry with Galyan. Worth 90 minutes for series fans.",1426550400,,204,5.212121212121212

4999590,5,B006JTN5VM,"The animation is beautiful and the story is amazing. I was enthralled the entire film, just waiting to see what would happen next. The characters were engaging - I especially like the emotional journey that Cassandra has to go through with Regalyan, as all the while they also try to untangle the growing conspiracy. This is a film worthy of the Dragon Age franchise, and in my opinion, is heads and shoulders over the franchise's other film, Dragon Age: Redemption.",1426377600,,466,4.8375
4999591,1,B006JTN5VM,"First off I would like to explain that this animation 'style' is simply a cover  for 'low budget', very little artistic quality went into any part of the visual production. As for the actual movie itself very little seems to be actualy related to the Dragon Age universe. Blood mages fight with inefficient staves instead of oh say magic, golems can be controlled with blood magic even without having blood themselves, and it seems really easy to kill dragons now, oh wait they explain that in one line shes from a family of dragon hunters. If that las part sounds really lazy to you then you can see the common theme this movie runs with. And just to get the facts right she stabs a dragon in the neck with a tiny dagger, must be their weak spot. Words like Kirkwall and Chantry and Templars are used in the movie but mostly as fan service, you can just change the words and then its not even realted to Dragon Age. Overall this is a slow moving, not thought out, cheap, and really just a lazy cash grab. The fim's protagonist is the only interesting character and I use the word interesting REALLY generously here. And truely I just mean the only one with a backstory. Her partner is some boring generic mage, as is the first enchanter, the blood mage leader is your generic scar-faced villian, and your templar commander is your paper-cut I'm a bad guy; what was his role in all this? What did he have to gain by helping? Oh we're never really told except that he and the Grand Cleric were trying for a power grab. How would that benifit his station? To put it short it's a very loose plot and i'm willing to bet money that if your main character wasn't also in the games, it would reduce the amount of people who give this film positive reviews.",1424822400,2,1749,4.398148148148148

4999593,3,B006JTN5VM,"My copy's cardboard cover was a little worn on the sides. Like the white of the cardboard showing kind of way? Still I can't complain. I've seen this movie in the past and I'm an avid Dragon Age fan. Can't beat $8. There isn't a limited/special edition of this much so having a copy of it at all will suffice. For future buyers, try buying it new it's worth it if you're a collector and don't like surprises like mine.

As for the movie: This movie is a great addition to your Dragon Age collection especially if you own the current installment in Dragon Age games (of course were talking Dragon Age Inquisition). The movie revolves around Cassandra Pentaghast who is apart of an elite order that overrides and surpasses the well known Templars of the Chantry. They are known as the Seekers of Truth, a direct arm of the Divine who are called in rare instances when Templars are being bad (kind of like Internal Affairs for police). The movie is done in a sleek anime CG (computer graphics) and visually far from what you might expect after the first two Dragon Age games. But the story and terms used are quite familiar as you've already familiarized with the plot concepts between mages and Templars in the game. The action is pretty good and the story is immersive enough. In my opinion they could have done a bit more with the antagonists of the story for it to feel more daunting and sinister. The soundtrack is decent and everything is presented well altogether. If you're a fan of Dragon Age, this is like a video archive of one of the main plot characters that is a must own. Cassandra Pentaghast is a great character and is also prevalent in the latest game Dragon Age Inquisition. The game makes a little mention of her history which references the movie so it's cool to have that history. OK enough said! Check it out!",1423008000,,1829,4.509036144578313

4999595,4,B006JTN5VM,"Is canon, this is canon. For anyone that played Dragon Age Inquisition, Cassandra informed the main character the story of how she became the Divine's right hand isn't all that interesting. Turns out she was just being modest. Cassandra kicks butt in this movie and makes you wish darn why couldn't this be a game instead of a CGI movie.
Con - Some of the voice acting is corny but once you get use to it, you get use to it and accept it.
pro - Cassandra keep kicks major butt. Great action sequences",1421452800,,500,4.329787234042553

It's good to see more of Cassandra's back story and watch her struggle with her temper and it's consequences - but you have to put up with about an hour of every other character being a useless twat while Cassandra as super girl solo kills dragons, demons and evil mages with ease - sigh.

I like knowing that out of work storm troopers must have been able to get jobs as templars so they could continue their long standing tradition of not being able to find, smite or hit anything - plus the daring use of blood mages that don't use magic in fights or for much of anything- such a bold choice!

4999601,4,B006JTN5VM,"Would only recommend to fans of the game, especially as a primer for Dragon Age Inquisition, which heavily features the main character of this film (Cassandra). As for the movie itself, the art style is great, and the the first 3/4 of the movie are very well done, imho. Sure, there are lots of fantasy tropes, but the build up to the conclusion is at least unpredictable and fun to watch the angry Cassandra's reactions to characters and situations. The final part of the movie is just outright predictable, but visually remarkable nonetheless.

Note: I rented the SD version and watched it on my tablet and it looked sharp. Not sure that this would be noticeably different in true HD.",1418515200,6,686,4.716666666666667

4999603,4,B006JTN5VM,"Being a fan of the Dragon Age games, I liked this movie before it even startedand by the time it ended, I still liked it! Cassandra (first seen interrogating Varrick in Dragon Age II) was the central character.  It was good getting a back story on her. Apparently this movie takes place before the events of Dragon Age II.

There are a lot of comments on the art.  For some reason, they chose to light all the characters with harsh blue/white light and set the shadow effects to all or nothingno gradiation. Everything else had normal 3D shading. Consequently the characters look like semi-3D line drawings dropped into a 3D world. I never got used to that strange art choice.  I almost wish they would just use the 3D world and characters they've already developed for the game and just make the equivalent of a 90 minute cut-scene. Some of the cut-scenes in the Dragon Age games are quite cinematic.

I hoped to see more magic spells being used.  Just a few Spirit Bolts thrown here and there, and one very brief Firestorm. There was a scene where a bunch of mages are being attacked, and they seemingly didn't cast any spells!  Just stood around waiting to get skewered.  How about a Cone of Cold, Chain Lightning, Crushing Prison, Winter's Grasp, Stonefist, Glyph of Paralysis SOMETHING. The mages overall seemed very limited in their abilities.

There were some good Special Features on the DVD disc.  A nice overview of the BioWare offices in Edmonton. Definitely the closest I'll ever get to seeing the place in person. And additional info from the BioWare guys on how this movie came about.  Even with all the little nit-picky issues I've brought up, I really did enjoy the movie.

Like maybe she showed up late the day the gave out armor, so she was at the end of the line and they said, 'oh darn, fresh out of pants. We have this miniskirt though. Maybe the mages will think your legs are too nice to stab?'

Poking fun aside, I liked it anyway. The friendship she forms with the circle mage feels genuine, and they do a nice job building tension for the final battle. Definitely watch it if you are going to play Inquisition, it gives Cassandra's character more depth.",1417910400,,580,4.420560747663552

Dawn of the Seeker is probably one of the best movie adaptations of a video game, and THE BEST in my opinion. You have a story worthy of a Bioware game, with characters unique in both their personalities and abilities. I won't spoil it, but there's an elf mage girl with abilities that are so unique she'd make a good companion character.

I came away from the movie more than satisfied with my purchase, a deeper knowledge of the Dragon Age universe, and a new respect for Cassandra (Which is probably necessary before playing Inquisition)",1402358400,,654,4.589743589743589

Cassandra, the lead in the story is a member of the Knights Templar who guarded the throne in medieval times and she is  a great swordsman and a fierce fighter. Top that off with her fierce temper and courage and you have the female version of Conan just with more discipline. There are wizards, mages, knights, ogres, dragons and anything else you would find in a dungeons and dragons storyline if it was put to animation but the plot and action is very good.

If you are going to phone in a candy movie just to feed a game story line, at least stay true to the mythos. This movie was barely accurate. Why even include enemy wizards if they are just going to (ineffectually) fight with staves and use hardly any magic?

Just... ugh

No.

Go elsewhere for your Dragon Age fix.",1395014400,2,340,4.435483870967742
4999626,2,B006JTN5VM,"Sorry to be harsh, but this was severely disappointing to me.

Let me start by saying that this film is so bad that it doesn't matter if you enjoy the games or not, you will be disappointed either way.

I'm a big fan of the Dragon Age video games. I enjoy the creative sociopolitical elements to the mythology behind. I was excited to hear there was a Dragon Age anime because I could not wait to see how a creative writing team would mine those elements and create a fresh new story set in this lush environment.

I was seriously let down.

Firstly, the film did not get into the non-human races that make the Dragon Age world so dynamic and fascinating. It is not a necessity to involve them in a film centered around a human protagonist, but it seems a shame not to. Frankly, it just didn't seem like something set in that universe without exploring the other races.

Secondly, for a film that focused primarily on the two militant factions of the fictional church, it didn't regard many of the more interesting aspects of the seekers or the templars. That seems lazy to me.

Finally, the story itself was boring and run-of-the-mill. All the typical tropes were there. I barely cared about the main character. The supporting character was mildly interesting, but hardly enough to carry the movie. The villains were uninteresting power-mongers. The dragon was pretty interesting, so that made for ten watchable minutes.

I also have to point out that the animation is piss-poor. Seriously, it's like watching stale, glow-in-the-dark, computer generated mannequins float over their backgrounds. Modern video games have cutscenes better animated than anything I saw in this movie.

Overall, the movie feels like the unwanted love child of a cheap kung-fu movie and a Renaissance Faire. Whether or not you know/like the games, avoid this waste of money. It barely has anything to do with DragonAge and is way too weak to stand on its own merits. If you want a DragonAge movie because you're a diehard fan, check out DragonAge: Redemption starring Felicia Day (like you haven't already). If you want anime about swords and sorcery, try Record of Lodoss War or something. Dawn of the Seeker does not deserve your time of money.",1387756800,2,2224,4.788511749347259
4999627,5,B006JTN5VM,I like this story line it stay true to the dragon age story line from the game with a little more added but this movie need to be longer and I think the shooed added this to the games,1386806400,,183,3.717948717948718
4999628,3,B006JTN5VM,Expected much more from this title.  Although it was entertaining it was less then spectacular.  I would recommend it for fans of the franchise though.,1386028800,,151,5.0
4999629,5,B006JTN5VM,"I was very excited when they had announced that there would be a DA animated movie. I was put off though when the animation style showed up. Im not a fan of CG movies, Im more traditional when it comes to animation and prefer 2D. I still bought this though because I really wanted to watch the story, and know more about one of the people that you will be fighting along side in DA:I, Cassandra. I was proven wrong,I had judged this movie before I had even seen it, and it was enjoyable and a solid entry in the DD universe! The people involved really cared about the source material, the story and the characters where interesting, and it does a good job at showing you how chaotic things get when s#*@ hits the fan in this universe. As for the animation style, its still not what I would have preffered, but given the actual 2D animation used in the ME movie, this was definitely an upgrade. If your familiar with games like Tales of Vesperia this is what the animation and graphic style looked like, which is by no means a bad thing! Check it out!",1381708800,,1050,4.308080808080808

Cassandra is a bit softer - and 18 years younger - than we see on Dragon Age 2 but already the bad arse Templar / Seeker we come to love. Her back story is revealed, as blood mages yet again try to attack the status quo. As usual some Templars aren't all that nice and some Chantry sisters have a smile on their face and a knife hidden, ready to betray you. And some mages aren't all that bad. Cassandra meets such a good mage and gets conflicted, learning that in Thedas things are never what they seem, good or bad. The Kirkwal rebellion mentioned on the movie is the one that put Meredith in charge as Knight Commander and NOT the one started on Dragon age 2. The Divine is also Beatrix, not Justinia as some Capcom promo material states. David Gaider has confirmed Dawn of the Seeker takes place in 9:22 Dragon when Beatrix was the Divine.

4999652,4,B006JTN5VM,"When it comes to video games, the Canadian video game developer BioWare is famous for creating successful video game franchises such as ""Baldur's Gate"", ""Neverwinter Nights"", ""Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic"", especially the popular ""Mass Effect"" series.

And in 2009, BioWare created ""Dragon Age"", a successful dark fantasy role-playing video game whichled to a sequel, ""Dragon Age II"" in 2011 and since have spawned novels, a Facebook game, a Flash game, a tabletop game, comic books, action figures, a web series and now, an animated film which was co-produced by BioWare, Electronic Arts and FUNimation Entertainment.

The animated film is directed by Fumihiko Sori, best known for his directed the live film ""Ping Pong"", but for animation, known for his style of anime featured in the films ""Appleseed"" and ""Vexille"".

The animated film was released in theaters in Japan in Feb. 2012 and in the United States in May 2012.  The film will also be released via Blu-ray/DVD combo on May 29th.

As ""Dragon Age: Origins"" took place in the country of Ferelden, in the continent of Thedas, gamsrs were introduced to the race and background of a Human Noble, Magi, Daish/City elf, dwarf commoner/noble but most importantly to the Dragon Age mythology.

While there is a connection between ""Dragon Age II"" to the ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"", in order to be accessible to a large audience who have never played the video game, a short narration is given on the state of the world.  But the  film features a younger Cassandra Pentaghast.

VIDEO:

""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" is an animated film that has Fumihiko Sori's style.  Presented in 1080p High Definition, ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray.

For those familiar with ""Applessed"", ""To"" or ""Vexille"", it's a unique style that Sori films are known for.  That is to feature beautiful background art, well-detailed surfaces, may it be vehicles, structures or in this case, dragons.  But most importantly, it's the design of his characters.  Some may say ""over-exposed"" or a ""shiny"" look.  It's unlike any other anime film and it's Sori's style of creativity and when you see this style, you know he's involved.

Sori is also known for having his films showcase black levels and shadow details.  Everything is pretty deliberate when it comes to the look of Fumihiko Sori's work and whether or not you like it, I personally have enjoyed Sori's animated films and see how far he can take his films and trying to incorporate realistic movements with his animated style.  And for the most part, he is able to accomplish a style that is much different from ""Vexille"" and also ""Appleseed: Ex Machina"", but you can tell from this film of how far Sori films have come since ""Appleseed"".

AUDIO:

""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" is presented in English and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and because the film's many action sequences, the film sounds absolutely impressive.  Great use of the surround channels, as well as LFE and dialogue and the musical score by Tetsuya Takahashi is crystal clear.  But things really do get immersive towards the final action sequences in the film and for the most part, audiophiles should be pleased with the lossless soundtrack.

And as far as the voice acting goes, both English and Japanese voicework are well-done.  Both Colleen Clinkenbeard and Chiaki Kuriyama do a magnificent job with their voice role for Cassandra Pentaghast and for J-Rock fans, I'm sure many will love the fact that Gackt does the voice of the Knight Commander.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" comes with the following special features:

  Bioware Studio Tour - (7:56) Mike Laidlaw (Creative Director of ""Dragon Age"") gives viewers a tour of BioWare's Edmonton studio.
  Dawn of the Seeker Backstage Pass - (20:40) Featuring BioWare and FUNimation staff discussing the film, the visual design of the characters, the characters in the film and how the movie came about.
  Dragon Age Production Art - View various sketches and art created during production of ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"".
  Previews - FUNimation Entertainment and BioWare trailers

EXTRAS:

""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" comes with a Blu-ray and two DVD's featuring the English feature film and the Japanese version of the feature film.  Also, included is a code for a free download of a ""Dragon Age: The Silent Grove"" digital-exclusive comic which can be redeemed from Dark Horse Comics' online store.  Also, the Blu-ray release comes with a slipcover case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have probably watched ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" four times now and part of the excitement of why I enjoyed this film is because of the work of Fumihiko Sori and his staff.  The look and feel of the animated film was very cool and I was very impressed by the 3D rendering of the dragons and also how beautiful the landscapes and structure were.  The Blu-ray really does a magnificent job in showcasing the detail plus the various colors of the film, may it be the dark blacks to the vibrant outdoor, day colors.

And for ""Dragon Age"" fans, especially those who have played ""Dragon Age II"", will get a kick out of watching a storyline that revolves around a younger Cassandra Pentaghast.  Also, for the fans who have watched the web series ""Dragon Age: Redemption"" and seeing the tie-in between Cassandra and the characters of ""Redemption"".

As for the film itself, while I do feel that ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" will appeal to ""Dragon Age"" fans, fortunately the storyline is accessible to those who have never played the ""Dragon Age"" video games.  Writer Jeffrey Scott (who worked on the animated TV series ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", ""Dragon Tales"", ""Mega Man"", ""Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"")  was able to make a straightforward screenplay that doesn't get too convoluted in Dragon Age mythos.  All you need to know is that Cassandra is a seeker, an important position within the Chantry and that she is on a mission to uncover a conspiracy within the Chantry and also how it relates to the Blood Mages.

The film itself is rather violent, has a lot of blood, major loss of body parts and thus the reason for the TV MA rating.  But for those who enjoy this genre will find ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" to be more to their liking and may entice them in playing the video game series.

The Blu-ray release looks and sounds magnificent and I was pretty impressed of how Sori's films have gotten better in look since his work on ""Appleseed"" and for audiophiles, the film also has its fair share of awesome moments during action sequences in producing an immersive environment.  As for special features, I did enjoy the studio tour of the BioWare Edmonton studio and also interviews with crew of BioWare and also Funimation but I was hoping to see a few more special features.  May it be an audio commentary or even featurette involving the Japanese side who worked on the film.

Overall, ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" is an enjoyable, action-packed film that will appeal to ""Dragon Age"" fans or those who love the action/adventure genre with swordfighting, monsters, dragons and sorcery.  While not a groundbreaking film, it's an animated film full of action and looks and sounds absolutely great on Blu-ray and features that Fumihiko Sori style that I enjoy watching!  The film takes place within the Dragon Age universe and showcases the origins of ""Dragon Age II"" characters Cassandra Pentaghast and Divine Justinia V.  And most of all... who doesn't love a strong female character who can kick major ass!?

The story might have been ok but I'll never know because the art direction was so awful I couldn't force myself to watch it.  Not worth the price unless you're just a dragonage completeist.,1344643200,3,482,4.829268292682927
4999658,3,B006JTN5VM,"I was really really lookin forward to this. I loved the first game, and have only briefly played the second. I really am in love with this world and I think this anime really added to it. The action could've been better, but the story was decent. And it really gave us our first look at the World of Dragon Age outside of Ferelden. We get to see some of Orlais, and even get to see the Vatican City inspired holy city. It was truly a site to behold, as well as the return of Dragons. I'd really like to see an actual anime series or something that gets to cameo or feature major players like the King and Cassandra who is the main character here, but a minor but important one in DA2 (her interrogations of the Dwarf Varric frame the narrative). So if you liked the games I suggest this film. It's beautiful to watch and the story just makes you want to go pay the game some more.",1344297600,2,880,4.152046783625731
4999659,4,B006JTN5VM,I liked the art when it looked realistic.  The romance was nice.  It was nice seeing a female being all heroic.  Some of the events seemed a little unlikely to occur but It all ended up okay.  I think they did a good job but I wish they had a better soundtrack so I could just listen to that.,1342310400,,292,3.8983050847457625
4999660,5,B006JTN5VM,It was like being in the game it was a really well thought out movie. i would recommend if you like the game to get this movie to add to your collection.,1341964800,,153,3.8125
4999661,5,B006JTN5VM,"What I like most about this venture was that it wasn't over sexualized and full of gratuitous breast shots. The was a solid tale with ideas from both the book and game. I'd say rent it first, then buy. Just stay away from the standard 480p version, go for the HD version.",1341964800,,271,4.230769230769231
4999662,2,B006JTN5VM,"I did not like this movie at all.
The animations were bad and the story the same.

The movies conclusion or ending if you will, are OK and you will nok feel like you have any questions or that you did not get the entire story because of a cliffhanger.

Give this 2 out of 5.",1340841600,2,274,3.875
4999663,5,B006JTN5VM,i am a fan of dragon age so i purchase this and a dragon age novel as well and i really love it and worth money spending.,1340841600,,121,3.5185185185185186
4999664,3,B006JTN5VM,"Let's face it, it's a video game inspired movie.  It isn't something that is going to be up for Academy Awards in the US.
That said, it is definitely on the good end of the spectrum for a Video Game movie.
Personally, I like the animation style, though I can see where some might not care for cell-shaded animation.
It is definitely better than Dragon Age Redemption, though I do not fault Felicia Day or Knights of Good for the limitations of that production.  Dragon Age is simply something that cannot be done on a limited budget as a live action production.

The story is predictable, and some of the voice acting isn't that great; but, again, it's a straight to DVD/Blu-Ray (atleast in the US) videogame movie made by a Japanese Studio based on a Western RPG and then dubbed with english speaking voice actors.

In the end, you probably know whether you're going to like the movie before you even read any reviews.  If you're not familiar with Dragon Age, or tend to not like movies based off video games, or don't like anime you should probably skip this movie.  Otherwise, you probably won't regret watching it at least once.",1340668800,4,1132,4.579207920792079
4999665,2,B006JTN5VM,"I don't hate anime universally, I enjoyed the FFVII movie, but I can't stand cheap computer animation.  The visuals of DA:DotS were barely tolerable (oddly, I thought it looked better with lots of action and worse when it was still frames).  I stopped watching after about a half-hour because the voice acting and the writing were so bad I couldn't see myself making it through another hour.  The voice actors lacked the level of quality I've come to expect from shows like Legend of Korra or Young Justice.  The writing/pacing was awful, the pauses between lines of poorly written dialog drove me crazy.

I'm so glad I didn't pay hardly anything for this.  Luckily, I have family who are into anime (and Dragon Age), so they may appreciate this more.",1340582400,4,751,4.7384615384615385
4999666,4,B006JTN5VM,"First off, I would like to state that yes, I am a woman, and a fan of the game series. That led me to purchase this title from amazon. I had no real idea about what the film would be like, apart that it was set in the world of Dragon Age.

The aninmation style was very different that what I was expecting. Every image had an almost ethereal glow. It made everything almost too pretty, but after a bit, I got used to it.

The story itself could have been taken from Dragon Age Origins, and I liked that. It should fit in that well.

The bad guy was pretty 2 dimensional, though, I wish we'd had at least a minute or two of backstory on how he became so hideous looking, apart from the whole ""I are a blood mage! RAR! I kill you all!"" thing.

Would I recommend this to people who have not played the games? Yes. The story is easily accessible, and enjoyable.",1340236800,50,857,4.083333333333333
4999667,4,B006JTN5VM,"As a Dragon Age nut this movie wasn't half bad at all. The key to this is you need to go into the movie with no epic expectations. You do that and the movie is pretty decent all things considered. It is by no means perfect or amazing but decent and worthy of the Dragon Age title. The animation is relatively decent which I was honestly not expecting. However, there are some cheesy dialogue lines by Cassandra espeically at the very end when she screams ""For The Chantry!"". To some it up this is a decent installment to the Dragon Age franchise, this is NO where near the same type of movie as Felicia Day's cheesy low budget Dragon Age title. I recommend this over Felicia's Day's movie....Sorry Felicia, we love you, but that movie sucked!",1339286400,2,742,4.463235294117647
4999668,5,B006JTN5VM,"First off, I have no idea what people are expecting when they say the animation was bad. Did you see the dragons and the demon? This particular animation style is usually pretty minimal, although if you've seen TO you'd see when it can become truly amazing! I don't know what others were watching this on, but I watched the Blu-ray on a 1080p 120hz Plasma TV and honestly the animation was colorful and impressive! The only downside of the animation were the numerous scenes in the dark wooded areas in the first half of the movie.
As far as the voice acting goes, could it have been better? Sure, I'd agree on that. Was it horrible? Hardly. I really like her character and would actually be interested in seeing her as a character in DA3. Not just a plot device like she was in DA2.
And then there's the tie-in. It was nice to learn where in the timeline this fit in to the games. I won't go into detail about the games. I will just say I enjoyed both of them, even with the clear mistakes made in DA2. I agree, if you haven't played the games you will have little understanding about the movie's context, but who cares? The movie was made to tie-in to the games.
I would highly recommend this to anyone that actually enjoyed the games. As a DA fan and a huge Anime fan, this was great for me. I would like to mention that I had no expectations when I saw this movie and still enjoyed it.",1339113600,,1389,4.265151515151516
4999669,5,B006JTN5VM,"As a huge fan of Dragon Age, this movie was much better than I anticipated. The action was absolutely amazing, as was the emotion. I cried a bit during a particular scene.

4999670,3,B006JTN5VM,"The plot was basic. Nothing to get excited about. My biggest issues with this film is the action with the mages. The mages fight with their staves as clubbing weapons, more than they do with Magic. Also at the end when fighting the abomination, they totally ripped off the ghostbusters scene with their multiple magic streams hitting one target, even the same sound effects. It was a little lame, and a let down. Thank god I didn't pay for this. I wouldnt pay more than 5 to 10 bucks for this dvd. Ill watch it again in a few days to see if it grows on me.

The opening of the film has a brief history of the major religion, the Chantry. For anyone interested in the Japanese version do not panic when you put it in and this opening is in English. The rest of the movie is in Japanese after the narration is over. I don't know why they did it this way. I found it completely unnecessary and lazy. This movie was shown in Japanese theaters, so I find it hard to believe they had an English opening there.",1338681600,3,692,4.536

4999675,4,B006JTN5VM,"This movie is definitely meant for the fans more than those who have no idea what Dragon Age is.

As a fan of the games I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. When I first saw it advertised here, I had a bit or morbid curiosity. For the most part Anime has been on a severe decline in quality of story telling and visuals lately, so I was none to pleased to see a Japanese studio handling it. CGI animation has never really been Japan's strong point. Even some of the better CG movies I have seen from them look pretty poor when compared to an American made one. (Appleseed vs Anything by Pixar.) Only exception I can think of I have seen is Final Fantasy Advent Children. I was also concerned about how well a country who's RPG's tend to be of a totally different flavor than western ones, would handle it.

I can say happily that they exceeded my expectations.

The animation and designs are good. Maybe not great. (would have rather seen it done like the game models used for cutscenes.) but they avoid looking totally stiff and lifeless.

The battle sequences. Yeah they fit the dragon age setting. Pretty much everything seen in the movie can be done in the game, or is shown in a game cut scene.

So for any fans of Dragon Age I can highly recommend.

On another note. Buy the Blueray, even if you do not have a player for it. It comes with the movie on DVD as well and as of May 31st 2012 is almost $10.00 cheaper than the DVD version.

For people who do not know much about the games or the setting, it does not rate as high. (3 stars there) It's still an entertaining watch, but you would probably get the feeling one gets when they start reading a book series halfway through. You may like what you see but you are totally lost on who is who.",1338422400,14,1757,4.24251497005988
4999676,5,B006JTN5VM,"At first I had some reservations about taking the Dragon Age franchise into the anime setting, but after having watched the movie and all of the special features I have to say that this is a good buy.  It blends with the Dragon Age storyline seamlessly, and provides some good background to a fairly critical character that you see in Dragon Age 2.  As a fan of the franchise, I found the story to be very well done and it provided a deeper understanding of parts of the Dragon Age world that we have not been able to experience yet.  I find it hard to justify this purchase to someone who is not a fan/has not played/heard of the franchise at all, since the movie relies heavily on the viewer knowing at least a little bit about the realm before having seen this, but it is a very good action film at the very least.  It also included a code inside for a free digital issue of the first issue of the Dragon Age comic that Darkhorse did, and that seems like that will end up being a good series to read too.  Overall, very well done movie which adds to the Dragon Age franchise and does not take away from it.",1338249600,9,1109,4.212264150943396

However when I saw the movie just few hours ago, I found myself enjoying quite a bit.  The story focuses on Cassandra as she and a Snarky circle mage name Galyan work to expose a conspiracy within the Chantry. That's all I'm going to say about the plot since I don't want give away any spoilers. Over all I think Bioware and Funiamation did a good job on this movie.",1338249600,5,480,4.161290322580645

I wanted to walk out, but the room was too crowded and my friend wanted to stay and watch the end. The entire movie's plot was totally predictable, as I was practically reciting it to said friend a half hour before the event would happen in the movie. I believe her when she says Dragon Age games are great, but I don't know if I'd want to play them if they are anything like this movie. Even all the DA fans in the room were wincing at every awkward, failed joke and lame plot twist. Plus, it didn't help that the movie's visual quality looked as if it was slapped together in the early 2000's. Trust me, don't see this movie. It's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back. You could spend it doing something better. Like actually playing a Dragon Age game.",1337904000,14,913,4.163841807909605

Yes, I also did not think that I would like this movie. My Husband was very excited to see it, and he thought that I would be too, but being that I didn't care for the video games, I certainly did not expect to even like this computer graphic animated version. Well, it was a bit of a slow start for me, but it begins to pick up after the main character - Cassandra -; a dragon hunter whose full of rage brought on from a painful past, discovers her master - Byron - secretly removing the recently rescued elf girl - Avexis -; with the power to control beasts, out of the protection of their High Seeker's custody, in order to bring her to a friend; whom he trusts to keep the elf child safe. Disregarding his requests, ultimately gets her beloved guardian killed, and Cassandra suddenly becomes part of a conspiracy and is branded a traitor. Byrons friend - Regalyan D'Marcall -; a loyal circle mage, does eventually show up, only to be captured along with Cassandra, by her fellow seekers. But with Cassandra's quick thinking, she gets herself and Galyan out of captivity. They then both embark on an arduous journey to uncover the true conspirators and put an end to their treachery against the Divine. Time is ticking, for the ""Ten Year Gathering"" is close at hand.

My favorite scene in the whole movie was Cassandra's battle with one of the true conspirators - Templar Knight Commander - in which she remembers her fallen comrade's last words to her: ""Hate Can Only Breed More Hate."" And she thus decides not to end the murderous bastards life. But he sees it as a sign of weakness. Taking advantage, he stealthy attacks Cassandra from behind, only to fail and meet his well deserved and delivered end. (Mwuaahaahaahaahaaa!) ""In The End, It Came To This...""

This film is definitely repeat watch worthy, and I can't wait to get a hold of this 3-Disc DVD version for my collection. Also, I do not recommend it for children below 17 years of age, as it is pretty bloody, like the video games, but better... And lastly, the way this film ends, you can expect a sequel, Yay!

The story takes place between Dragon Age and Dragon Age II and the plot was good (no spoilers). I know some people didn't care for it, but I thought the voice acting and animation were just fine as well. Towards the end of the movie things get a little far fetched, but it's all in good fun, and hey, this is Dragon Age so some crazy heroics are expected. All in all the movie works because it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's funny at times, dramatic at others, and moves along at a good pace.
