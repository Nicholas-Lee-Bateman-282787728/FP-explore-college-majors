7935214,5,B00005ABEP,"This documentary follows the roots of Cuban music, explores its fundamental genres such as son, and traces development of this music for much of the 20th century, to a point when it began to be called latin music or salsa. It's not an encyclopaedia, of course, but gives very good overview of the music.",1230249600,,303,4.62962962962963
7935215,4,B00005ABEP,This is a great documentary of who we truly are in our music! This tells our whole musical history of how our music all began! A must for latin fans!,1217721600,,149,4.0
7935216,5,B00005ABEP,"I was amazed by this DVD.  It's actually three programs in one, totalling 3 hours.  Harry Belafonte is an amazing host, and he travelled to Cuba, Africa and Spain to research this.  I was excited to see the origins of Cuban music, and it made me wish I had been there.",1216598400,,268,4.215686274509804
7935217,5,B00005ABEP,I bought this item and would say that it was everything I wished for and more. Educational and entertaining. It really goes deeply into Caribbean culture and demonstrates how music and dance from west africa share much of an almost identical history due to slavery and colonisation. It traces musics and dance directly from Africa to the Caribbean and North America( the Americas). Highly recommended.,1192838400,,401,5.184615384615385
7935218,5,B00005ABEP,"Wow! I don't even know where to begin...it's a great documentary on the history of Cuba, music, roots, rhythm, culture and the people. It was beautifully edited! Belafonte did a wonderful job in explaining the history of cuba's music. You will want to stand up and begin to dance. Why sit down?

Get it! I am!

Azucar!",1111363200,4,318,4.56140350877193
7935219,5,B00005ABEP,"This is one of my all time favorites, and Harry Belafonte is the perfect host. He's delightfully informal and shares personal insights along the way, such as how his contract was cancelled by the mob who ran the Copacabana because he'd married interracially.

One of the aspects I particularly enjoyed was the look at everyday life in Cuba, and the discussion of the U.S. role in that country's history. Without hammering away at the fact, Belafonte discusses our government's unwillingness to recognize Cuba's sovereignty, and expresses his hope that music will break down the barriers. But politics aside, this video series is a must-see for any student of African American music, and Spanish American heritage.",1100736000,12,713,5.2
7935220,4,B00005ABEP,"This 3 video collection is a must have for all interested in Latin music  history from Africa to Cuba to New York. Has some amazing music clips of  Dizzy Gillespie, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, etc.",965174400,24,194,4.514285714285714
