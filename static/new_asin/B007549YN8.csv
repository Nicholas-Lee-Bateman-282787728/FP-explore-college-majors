5056892,5,B007549YN8,"I remember watching this series as a kid and I'm glad these quality shows are showing up on disk.  The accuracy of the Hoover Bureau and its Special Agents is right on the mark.  The Director of this series reminds me of the attention to detail Jack Webb put into making his famous Dragnet and Adam-12 series or Joseph Wambaugh's Police Story series.  If you are interested in knowing what the Bureau was like under Hoover, the series is an excellent representation.  The FBI is an elite law enforcement agency and this series really drives the point home.",1342569600,3,556,4.642857142857143
5056893,5,B007549YN8,"For the episodes The Executioners Parts 1 & 2, we get the original 'Next The FBI in Color' announcement at the start and the full 'Ford Motor company present The FBI' opening. Good to have!",1336694400,4,189,4.428571428571429

5056896,5,B007549YN8,"Somewhere along the years, the FBI became a stereotype of black suits or pushy climbers. However, this series was when the FBI was supposed to make US safe and did their jobs like grown up professionals. And what an ensemble case they have. As you read the list of guest stars, you have to have yet another season, to see your favorite actors take on the role of bad guys. Check out the Ford Mustangs that evolve with the show, which must have been sponsored by Ford. Great nostalgia.",1375315200,2,484,4.449438202247191

5056902,5,B007549YN8,"I was always a fan of this series when I was a kid, but hadn't seen any episodes in decades. It was the first Quinn Martin series I remember and I always enjoyed the distinctive style of his shows. Season one was good, but disappointed me slightly with an overall tone and production values that were not quite what I remembered. Season two is better. The scripts appear sharper, the acting a bit more natural and less wooden, and the storyline with Erskine's daughter is gone for good.

The transfers are OK but do not appear to be digitally remastered, and some episodes could have benefited from this. These appear to be syndication copies. Only two episodes, ""The Executioners"" parts 1 and 2, retain the full original opening with the credit to the Ford Motor Company retained, which makes the rough cut in the theme music in all the other episodes make more sense, as the Ford credit is cut and so the music takes a jump. Those two episodes also retain the original pre-opening of a title slide and the announcer saying ""The F.B.I. - in color!"", just like in the old Police Squad comedies. One thing I had forgotten was that only in the first 2 seasons was there a rather crude attempt at showing some Washington DC landmarks in the opening titles, and these were not very well done. This goes away in season 3.

These episodes are fun to watch. Everyone, both good and bad, drives a Ford product of course, as Ford was the sponsor and made sure their vehicles were featured. I always thought that perhaps they should have had the bad guys drive competitor's vehicles! Efrem Zimbalist was perhaps too suave for a typical F.B.I. agent, but he is a great leading man and carries the part well. Stephen Brooks never sold me as an F.B.I. agent, coming across as a bit too young and not serious enough, and perhaps that is why he was replaced after this season with the much more agent-like William Reynolds. There are some good location shots and it is fun to see actors who later had success play roles here, and to see some young actresses who were stunningly beautiful in the 1960s style - Barbara Luna and Jessica Walter come to mind. It is also interesting to see the 1960s-era crime lab techniques that are relied upon to process evidence.

Recommended, but disappointed that the price of admission is so high.",1350864000,3,2317,4.578313253012048
5056903,5,B007549YN8,"This is a really awesome show!. It may be way before my time but I have loved every single episode in season 1 and 2. Luckily I got the last 3 as gifts because I am against half seasons because they are ripping off fans on purpose and taking up double the space necessary on my shelves. I bought S1P1 myself because it looked like a great late-night crime show and it was on sale for a steal.  But then I wanted more and refused to spend the money on half seasons. I am blessed with family who knows what I like, so I got the others as bday/Christmas gifts and haven't tired one bit of the show.  It's one of those shows that I have to pace myself with 2 before bed or I'll end up watching the whole series in 2 days!

Great crime stories, crime solving, FBI glory days type of show with great acting and really great visual and audio quality, especially given the age.  You reallt cannot tell the difference in quality from a current DVD.  Some of the old shows, before the 70's especially, have a lesser video quality, which does not bother me in the least, because it really feels like it is appropriate for the shows, but ti is also nice to have such a good production quality in a show that so incomprehensibly expensive.",1342656000,3,1226,4.244635193133047

8510431,5,B007549YN8,enjoy this so much. the old shows with the old cars looking so great. The streets and stores are so neat and no riots seen without police stopping them before damage occurs.  The stories are meaningful and the actors dress like they care about how they look and talk.  Crime is being kept under control and not in control as it is today. And the victim is considered more than the criminal. What refreshment,1419984000,,407,4.486486486486487
