8258529,4,B0015I2SK6,Purchased the movie only because Michael T. Weiss one of my favorite actors was in this movie.  Did enjoy it only giving it four stars because his part was less than three minutes.,1463875200,,180,4.454545454545454

8258531,1,B0015I2SK6,"I bought this film without really knowing a lot about it.  I liked the cast so I went for it...Not a good move on my part.

This whole film centers around a man who can't sleep, to the point that his body is dying.  Okay.

I haven't never seen so many good actors try so hard to make a bad film work.  This film was poorly directed, written, and it hurts me to see so much talent wasted!

I knew I was in trouble as a viewer when I started yelling at the screen, ""DIE ALREADY!""

Needless my advice to all who might find this film interesting is; Don't bother.",1233619200,7,559,4.027272727272727
