Grapevine Video has successfully remastered Eve's Leaves on DVD, and I can testify they've done a great job! This is the fourth silent film I've seen so far, but this is the first one I've seen that's been tinted in the remastering process. Most of the film is a light gold/sepia color while the night scenes are bluish, so don't expect a black and white print (something a prefer). I can understand that this film was probably tinted to hide flaws, but personally, I like to see films in beautiful b&w.
Also, in the other silents I've seen, they have a lovely soundtrack with what sounds like a complete orchestra, leaning heavily on the string section. In this version of Eve's Leaves, the entire music score is played by an organ. It's alright, but could have been far better and more beautiful if it had been a full orchestra. But don't think I'm giving Grapevine Video's efforts a negative review! These two points are merely personal preferences of mine.
The film itself is delightful. As the title says, this film is about Eve (Leatrice Joy) but William Boyd (the reason I purchased this film) is in it quite abit, especially the further you get in the film.
I hope to see more of William Boyd's pre-Hopalong movies released on DVD by Grapevine Video or other companies in future.
Overall, this DVD version of Eve's Leaves is highly recommended!",1467331200,,1455,4.709803921568628
8507410,5,B00700Z2KG,"Since silent movies were ""before my time"" I have to admit it took me a bit of getting used to viewing them.  I purchased this because William Boyd is my favorite actor of all time ever since I watched him as Hopalong Cassidy on TV as a child.  Wanting to see his earlier movies, I purchased ""Eve's Leaves"" and glad I did.  This was my first introduction to Leatrice Joy and she's great.  Put them both together as they are in this movie and....what a hoot!  Silent movies, of course, rely on exaggerated facial expressions and body movements, along with title cards to help the story along. And just like the actors in this movie, the title cards are very expressive and humorous!  I'll be watching this movie again and again!",1424649600,2,726,4.5038167938931295
