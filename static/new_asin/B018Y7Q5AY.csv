7559606,5,B018Y7Q5AY,"Interesting commentary on human experience.  Personally, as someone who had a unique experience at the birth of my daughter, when I saw a pulsing lotus flower while meditating during my natural and orgasmic labor (I figure my pain pathway took me to the same place others see when they are dying as written by Dr. Elizabeth Ross on life after death, The tunel with the flowering lotus with a million different petas, or the way ""lotus eaters"" or opium addicts who waste their life looking at the lotus felt).  The Last Avatar resonated with some of my experience of the primitive feelings of oneness with the universe and love completely that I experienced physically and visually while giving birth to my daughter. Then I was examined by a cute physician whose touch ruined my experience by bringing basic human attraction into a moment that was otherwise divine.  Anyway, I was stuck in my own isolation for years with the only way to bridge the divide between my weird experience and the people around me was through storytelling.  That experience with the lotus flower and orgasmic labor and the physician was all I wanted to think about for years and years. I've gotten really good at sharing my story, I even wrote a book about it as fiction based on the true story, All in Her Head by Sunny Mera. So when I watched the movie, I could relate because I feel my energy, I at times see other's aura's or ""light body"", but my psychiatrist wants to raise my medication whenever I talk about it.  So, watch this movie with caution, because if you tell your psychiatrist about this inner truth, s/he will try to medicate you even more than you currently are.  I mean, I know I need the medication, I got sick in response to my experience that clearly didn't fit the mainstream narrative that defines our current reality, but in my view, with dealing with so many untruths in our current reality, with ""fake news"" maybe taking a journey inside and listening to our own experiences of ancient wisdom is important.  Maybe there is more emotional honesty and truth in my alternate reality, where things like ""Light Bodies"" are allowed, than in the dominant culture where our energy and chi are ignored. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in their inner world.  Or curious about mysticism and modern human experiences, although you'll need to suspend your beliefs (the movie graphics are low tech), but if you are a feeling individual, who is in touch with your inner world, you may like the story. I know I did.",1494979200,2,2521,4.6877828054298645

This is also great timing with the current state of the world! we need everyone to step up & find their higher self & be the Kalki of their own circles & communities!

7559633,4,B018Y7Q5AY,"Great message ..but....if you can get past the low budget, the sometimes good, often mediocre to bad acting, the message is clear.  It's almost as if it were done poorly on purpose, like, having to eat healthy for the overall great outcome even if it tastes bad.

I thank all who participated in this project, because  I get what you're sharing.  Others won't be able to see past the low budget production and get lost in that, instead of feeling the actual story and its message.  A testimony to what we now value? I think so.

The question that comes to my mind is, if a sacred text, whatever you believe to be sacred were written on a scrap of paper, would you dismiss the wisdom because the paper was torn  and wrinkled?  Many would not even touch  the paper to start with and sadly would simply pass  by the opportunity for a higher wisdom.  I'm glad I did not, my wish for you is to not judge this book by its cover and open to the knowledge being passed on within a quaint and simple storyline.

Everyone else was totally amateurish. I think they could have found a high school student who could have done better ""special' (not that special) effects.

7559654,2,B018Y7Q5AY,"This film is a low budget production, it uses cliched images like chakra in the bodies of various people having enlightening experiences, shown in the classic Chakra chart form that you see on the walls of various healers or ""spiritual"" group meet up places. It also uses terms like light bodies and other rather over used new age learned language. The depth of some charactors is very thin, and the story moves along with speed but no depth. The enemy "" the ruling elite"" seemed incapable of doing much at all, and the idea that thier operative would just be happening to run a crystal/ spiritual paraphernalia shop in some hippy town where the hapless hero appears, is also pretty thin and implausible. I am not sure who the target audience is, but I think this movie is was ill thought out.
The references to the ""Force"" that flows though everything and is your friend, was so overtly Star Wars that it made me cringe, being a big Star Wars fan.

The idea that the planet has been taken over by entities who feed on negative energy and run many beings who are currently here in human bodies was also not well explained, were there 2 souls in each body? It appeared to be case when the big boss of the evil elite was excised of his evil entity. But that idea is again taken from some idea of possession and frankly is catering to another false idea. I think it is about time we had a main stream well funded movie that really opens people to the truth...... we are immortal beings, we are all suffering (to varying degrees) from Amnesia of our eternal existence, unfortunatly this film seemed to be hijacked by suedo or low level spiritual understanding as made obvious by making a crystal so important to the awakening of the hero, when spiritual beings as we all are, do not need pretty rocks to enable us. Nor do we need rituals, nor sacred spaces or mountains. I was excited by the advert, that it might be something it sadly was not. The girl with feathers was hot though.

7559661,2,B018Y7Q5AY,"I resonate strongly with some of the themes in this movie. Especially telling, is the call to awaken from a trance of greed, conflict and fear, to reclaim our personal autonomy and live a spirit-focused life.  But the way these messages are couched, I think detracts from their power.  The story of an actual living Avatar in the present day, who will somehow save us from ourselves and our overlords,I think requires a good deal of suspended disbelief.  I _wanted_ to follow the movie there, but found that I really _couldn't_.  The esthetic gaffes are just too numerous and too glaring.  Specifically, the acting and writing just took way too much ""chewing"" to digest, if you follow.

One real highlight however, is the music!  Adey presents us with richly textured compositions, intricate, dreamy, sophisticated and melodic, and deeply evocative.  It's in a completely different league from the rest of the film.  So much so that it's a bit disconcerting at times!  Might even be worth the price of the rental, just to be introduced to her music. :)
