8218369,5,B000VE4UQ0,"EXTREMELY well written, and the sincere politeness of Brown is fantastic. The ease of the lady's answering questions was relaxing, they could go into their lives. More than just movie details. Julianne Moore loves to laugh. Very professionally done, 100% quality. I liked the way he let ""them"" talk most.-jg",1465084800,,307,5.16
8218370,5,B000VE4UQ0,This is a very nice series. On par with Inside the Actors Studio at a very good price considering all the content. Really enjoyed it. Along with the AFI Directors series I learned much.,1415836800,,185,4.470588235294118
8218371,5,B000VE4UQ0,"I found a lot of inspiration from these interviews. The actors (Moore, Weaver) are two of my favorite and the style of the interview really let them show their personalities.",1402444800,,174,4.833333333333333
8218372,4,B000VE4UQ0,I thought this was going to be Inside the Actors Studio of interviews but it was something as good and with more artist. I am glad I found it and it was there to get.,1352937600,,166,3.7714285714285714
8218373,4,B000VE4UQ0,"the interviews are interesting and intelligent
some are more exciting than others
but a good selection and well worth the price",1202169600,,127,5.095238095238095
8218374,4,B000VE4UQ0,"Well, it's Inside the Actor's Studio and it's not. The interview format is similar, perhaps a bit more free-form and personal. It's a big auditorium audience and there is no Q&A. I particularly liked the sessions with Martin Scorsese and Susan Sarandon. Film buffs and fans will go for it!

8218375,5,B000VE4UQ0,This is really a great box set.  Very well put together and features a lot of my favorite actors and directors.  Professor Brown is a great interview with none of the pomp and stuffiness of The Actor's Studio.  I know a lot of movie-going fans (and Clooney fans!) who will love getting this for Xmas.,1195344000,4,300,4.418181818181818
