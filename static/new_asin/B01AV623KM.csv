8748533,3,B01AV623KM,"Michael Wood finally disappoints......

Generally underwhelming, protracted and visually dominated by the presenter (fine if the preseneter is some 'lush' or 'hunk' [depending on one's inclinations]...)

Michael Wood's impressive documentaries in the past have always been laced with his forte for philosophical musings, but here it is so excessive, as to undo the intrinsic value of the subject.

If you want 'hard history', that is, facts and figures about achievements, architecture, technology, science, wars, famine, invasions, economics, geography etc, you will be disappointed. Some of it is here, but it is very much incidental.

Instead, you will have to endure long, repeated scenes of Chinese opera, village storytellers, legends, temples, priests, shots of (and not excluding the host) the examples of script and philosophical musings about divination, ancestor worship, poetry, Dragon Bone scratchings, Mandate of Heaven  -  all of which are surely important in describing much of the historical Chinese character  -  but which could have been handled in 20 minutes.... In fact, there is value in these insights, but the excessive nature of these mutterings does undo their impact and becomes tedious.

Two examples: The first episode has 10-15 minutes of the monk Xuanzang who helped bring Buddhism to China, trudging through the Hindu Kush .... A few succinct lines and some equally useful visuals would suffice.

Secondly, Wood trolls along the massive Tang walls of Xian muttering esoterica without even a passing reference to this mind-boggling structure that dwarfs anything ever constructed in the West.  This sort of thing just doesn't cut it..... (He does make up a little with his comment about the Ming walls in a later episode.)

There are other issues such as an over-amped soundtrack (mainly in the first episodes where the only way you are going to know what he is saying is with the subtitles ), firework-display fillers, average camera work, indifferent location selection, and some quite wonky Chinese pronunciation, (which to his credit, does get better later on...)  All would be forgivable if it were not for the lack of hard, pertinent, employable information.

So this documentary has its moments, with 'tightness' and 'grit' only starting to appear in the last two episodes, which naturally of course, are rushed and simplistic (eg.he tactfully avoids mentioning that without American finance Mao Zedong's Communist revolution might have been still-born. They financed him to fight the Japanese, in the same way as they financed the Russian Communists and others to fight the Germans)......

The other four hours of rambling and endless fillers of oral village plays etc could have been squeezed into an episode.

Stretching it out for 6 hours may be profitable for Maya Productions to sell to the BBC etc, but expensive on viewer time and patience.

And generally, when is some documentary-maker going to learn to focus at least some time on the subject matter rather than the presenter...?",1489449600,21,3028,5.301255230125523
