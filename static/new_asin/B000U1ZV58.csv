2913613,4,B000U1ZV58,This is a great purchase for the girl in your life that loves horses. It is appropriate for children 9 and up. Brings back some old memories and brings a new generation to enjoying these great horse movies. Great to have 4 in one collection.,1231200000,2,241,4.377777777777778
2913614,5,B000U1ZV58,4 good movies for the ones who loves horses. The Best one is National Velvet:-),1212019200,,79,4.333333333333333
2913615,3,B000U1ZV58,My granchildren liked all the movies. I gave them as presents and haven't seen them for myself.,1211328000,,95,4.647058823529412
2913616,3,B000U1ZV58,"What you see is what you get! 4 films, no special extras, but 4 old favourites at a reasonable price. Highly recommended to those who just want to watch the 4 films without any bells and whistles. A good choice of movies for the horse lover.",1210723200,5,241,4.260869565217392
2913617,3,B000U1ZV58,"The Seabiscuit movie sucked, it was just a Shirley Temple vehicle. National Velvet, well, what can be bad about that? International Velvet was really a prety good movie, sad I can't seem to find it by itself. Black Beauty, well, it was a pretty fair horse movie, and the star horse was very well trained.",1208649600,3,304,4.545454545454546
2913618,5,B000U1ZV58,To have all these horse story greats in one package is just the best idea anybody has ever had.  I'd reccommend this set to any HORSE LOVER.  Would make an EXCELLENT gift too.,1208131200,,175,4.2727272727272725
2913619,5,B000U1ZV58,"I LOVE International Velvet.  This is the real reason I bought the DVD, but now I have 3 other GREAT movies.  I appreciate the fact that they are all 'family friendly'!!",1204156800,8,169,4.419354838709677
2913620,5,B000U1ZV58,"With three classic releases that would appear on any tote board, it would be easy to call International Velvet a longshot which can be dismissed. But like Seabiscuit, getting past a quick initial glance will find a racer with the will of champion.

Released in 1978, director Bryan Forbes tackles the sequel to National Velvet with a keen eye on a compelling script. Nanette Newman (a grown-up Velvet)and Tatum O'Neal (her niece) are wonderful in their roles, with the storyline centering on the niece striving to become an Olympic-caliber rider.

Sir Anthony Hopkins portrays a veteran trainer who has seen many riders boast about such goals, but end up falling away when the going gets difficult. He has a special eye for talent, though, and there just may be unique potential with this young rider.

These are four movies which families can enjoy together, but the life lessons can be appreciated by adults, as much as children.",1203724800,28,931,4.917197452229299

2913801,5,B000U1ZV58,"My granddaughters can't get enough of horse stories, but this quartet of classics takes them a long way there. The DVD's are well prepared transfers with no flaws. Each is a unique story centered on a horse, but with human interest, drama, and strong family values. My favorite is International Velvet, but my granddaughters prefer Black Beauty and National Velvet. The later starring teen-aged Mickey Rooney and Elizabeth Taylor, predates my childhood, but still comes through today. Velvet Brown wins the show with her horse, but of course can't hold the title since she is female. International Velvet picks up the story when an orphaned niece comes to live with her then much older Velvet Brown. Tatum O'Neal plays a moody teen who falls in love with a horse and in the end a horse rider and competitor. In each of the four stories, the horses face as much adversity as their owners.",1413158400,,887,4.803921568627451

2913834,3,B000U1ZV58,"Pretty good deal. I like three outa the 4,but wish I didn't have the 4th because of bad language and other non child friendly stuff.

National Velvet is a classic, I think one of the very best things Elizabeth Taylor did. A must for horse lovers and a great character building type movie with a dear mother exemplified in it.

Seabiscuit is fun, corny, but fresh and entertaining. You might get a kick outa seeing Shirley Temple grown. Not a great actress, but its still worth a watch.

Black Beauty is very well done and as I remember the book fairly accurate.  I enjoy this one as have children from 2-16.

International Velvet is not a repeat watch. I barely made it through the first time. It is not a really pleasant story, it kinda strains to make things fit as a National Velvet sequel and the show goes on and on with few rewarding moments...there are some.  Do not recommend.",1397088000,2,884,4.459627329192546

I always play the DVD to make sure there are no defects or glitches and this DVD had Black Beauty and Seabiscuit on it. National Velvet and Int'l Velvet were not on it. I very much enjoyed Black Beauty and Seabiscuit as they are movies I've seen on TV less frequently than the ""Velvet"" movies. If all 4 movies were on the DVD I'm sure it would be great! I highly recommend these movies for families!",1355356800,,501,4.02

I am pretty sure they used the actual race footage in the Seabiscuit movie, which was great! I didn't even realize there WAS an old Seabiscuit movie.... And such a plus to see Shirley Temple again!!!It was little different take on the story, from the modern Seabiscuit movie, so that was interesting as well.
All in all, I highly recommend.",1349395200,3,592,4.342342342342342
2913937,4,B000U1ZV58,"My family loves all stories and movies about horses, so we thought this collection would be perfect, but we were not as pleased with the full collection.  The very best film in this collection is National Velvet, and in the last 6 months have watched it weekly as a family!  It is a beautiful story with a strong, young girl protagonist that carries a wonderful message and has a beautiful setting and gorgeous horse scenes. Black Beauty is a quality story, but the film has some very uncomfortable scenes that involve the horses being mistreated, and there are quite a few very sad moments, so it is not an enjoyable movie for more sensitive people.  Seabiscuit is more of a romance film between the human characters, taking place in a race-horse setting, so it is not really for horse lovers or for kids.  Finally, most insulting to all of humanity, is the atrocity International Velvet.  Do not bother trying to view this mockery of a horse-lover's film.  It is absolutely not for youth, as much of the film revolves around adult situations, and includes a bit of violence and, as my son said after watching the first five minutes of a smoking, bare-chested Christopher Plummer talking about mature subjects with a self-absorbed, annoying supposed-adult version of Velvet, ""creepiness.""  Sadly, this is intended to be a sequel to National Velvet, as one of the characters is an adult Velvet, however, she is so unlike the original youth, so unlikable, so much of the opposite that you would expect Velvet to become, that it is truly disturbing.  As well, the film was made in the 1970's, and has the bland cinematography of that era, as opposed to the beautifully filmed National Velvet.  Do your family a favor and watch National Velvet, try out Seabiscuit and Black Beauty, and TOSS International Velvet out the window.",1340582400,17,1824,4.82051282051282

2913940,5,B000U1ZV58,"Once again we made an excellant decision and purchased a top quality  product.  I remember when this movie first came out and years later my daughters watched it on television. Our youngest daughter was a fanatic for National Velvet and when it came on television we had to tape it so she could watch it regularly, so much so that she knew every actors lines all the way through the movie. Unfortunately the tape quality became poor and we were unable to purchase it here in Australia on dvd. Thank you Amazon for four excelland movies and luckily my daughter was able to purchase a dvd player here in Australia to view movies from America. Excellant product and service once again.

The second story, International Velvet, doesn't follow the details of the original story all that well, but it's well enough that it's believable and the story is enjoyable.  It makes a pretty good choice for a horse-lover and I found it a good way to get both National Velvet and International Velvet on DVD at a reasonable cost.",1321833600,,522,4.788888888888889

You stand and cheer and feel pride for all the actors. Just super. Need a lot more movies like these on the sceens of movie houses today. These were worth the money spent. Again the service was as good if not better than our Maiden buy.

2913987,5,B000U1ZV58,"My sister had given me Black Beauty on VHS and I must have watched that half a dozen times. It begins with Black Beauty in his final home, then shifts back to his birth and gentling. It was cute to see how oats  helped him deal with the bit and girth. It does take place in England, as opposed to the NBC mini-series that took place in Maryland. In  Black Beuaty, there is a voice for him, but not for the other horses. When he is sold to Squire Gordon he meets Ginger and Merrylegs, and is paired with Ginger to drive the carriage. When the squire's wife takes ill, Beauty and Ginger are sold, and so begins the many owners he has to deal with until in the end the grown-up Joe Green (the young lad who nearly killed him) gives him his last home. The Story of Seabiscuit stars Barry Fitzgerald, whom I take to be a real Irishman and Shirley Temple, who is not Irish. The subject is a small-sized, non-inspiring colt named Seabiscuit who catches Uncle Shawn's eye and, over initial objections, convinces his boss to keep him and let him train him for the racetrack. After a very unpromising start, the colt begins to win, and win, and win, and, in a match race against Sir Barton, shows the bigger horse his heels. A rags-to-riches story that ended with Shawn having the last laugh on the two who had written the little fellow off. National Velvet has been around for so long if you haven't seen it, you just don't watch horse movies. I loved the pairing of Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney, and the exciting running of the Grand National. International Velvet was such a superb sequel in my opinion I was put out by the lack of recognition it received. Christopher Plummer, Sherlock Holmes in Murder by Decree, was so good as ""Uncle"" John, and poor Velvet was at a loss in dealing with the rebelious Sharah until they discovered her love for horses. That scene where Velvet asks Sarah to go fetch the Pie, only to have Sarah realize that it is not the Pie, but her foal, and to have the two running toward each other, is beautiful. To watch an awkward young Sarah become an accomplished rider, under the guidance of Captain Johnson, played by the dashing Anthony Hopkins, and represent her country (she was born in England) in the Olympics was fascinating. To think the actress was able to learn to ride as she did over those jumps was quite an achievement. The ending, when Sarah makes her way over the mud to where Velvet and John were waiting, and introduce them to her fiancee Scott as ""my parents,"" just made my heart soar.",1234742400,47,2531,4.440860215053763
