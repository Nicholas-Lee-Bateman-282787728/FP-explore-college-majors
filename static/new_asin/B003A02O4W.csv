4099666,1,B003A02O4W,No nudity in this movie.  You get to see a very brief appears to be poorly simulated sex scene with the girl on the cover of the film.  She leaves her underwear on.  Not a good skin flick.  You can read about the story in the other reviews.  I bought this strictly for skin...and it wasn't there.,1289952000,,296,4.12280701754386
4099667,1,B003A02O4W,"Be warned, do NOT watch this film except as an excersize in psychology and bad production/execution.  The director/protagonist clearly possesses a Christ syndrome that I believe he likely possesses in real life.  His character, throughout the film, bemoans unspeakable (literally) heartbreaks while oversea's with the army.  This is definitely familiar and rings true.  It recalls 90 percent of the lazy douche bags I served with, and the invented sorrowful tales that they thought made panties fall off when they were drunk back home.  If you gave any of these inept, insincere, self-indulgent individuals a camera and told them to direct a film, they would also choose to STAR in it, as the lead no less, and make it about sex...and about themselves...

This is not such a bad idea for a film, and could have been done very well and very comedically.  Unfortunately, the well of experience the writer/director draws from is not sufficient for this material.  You will be continually flogged over the head about how much ""real"" stuff ""Bill"" has dealt with throughout his life.  The director is trying to validate himself through a character he is playing in his own production!  Self-evident, blatant, uneducated contrivance of ANY of the subject matter relevant to himself or the film exposes the sham immediatly!  It's really gross to watch.  The supporting cast while non-professional is largely very good.  The two ""stoner"" archetypes are amusing and well improvised and are really the only minorly entertaining thing about this film.",1289088000,9,1539,5.157258064516129
4099668,5,B003A02O4W,"Everyone should order a copy or two and see this work of genuis. Hugh Massey III is truly a indie filmmaker making his break with this entertaining mocumentary that challenges funny films like Spinal Tap and For Your Consideration. I honestly busted a gut laughing my ass off. Please don't miss out on this masterpiece.
Get it or lose out.

8392723,1,B003A02O4W,I don't write reviews normally but feel compelled to warn people not to waste their time watching this.  Pretty sure this is the dumbest movie i've ever seen.,1526169600,,158,4.642857142857143

8392725,1,B003A02O4W,"This is legit the stupidest ""mockumentary"" I've ever seen in my life. If you're into developmentally challenged neckbeards laughing endlessly at their own dimwitted attempts at humor then you may enjoy this (SPOILER: you won't enjoy it no matter what you're into).",1491868800,2,264,5.309523809523809

8392727,5,B003A02O4W,"If you're looking for something different go no further! I don't want to give it away but,  some other reviews don't seem to be picking up on it, this is a mocumentary. Its right there in the synopsis. I can see where some might get confused there are some serious moments.  I found myself at times questioning whether this was real or not. Great performances. I cringed and laughed all the way through the journey. Interesting editing and camera work.  Great sound track. Kind of slow at the beginning but really picks up! Check it out!",1474934400,2,537,4.572916666666667
8392728,4,B003A02O4W,"Okay, it's true that there's not any nudity in this pic, but there is ""skin"" and definitely some sexual tension going on.  It's not necessarily pretty (the sex stuff) but I think that's the whole point.  After reading the reviews, it seems like people think this is a real documentary, but there are several clues that it's actually a mockumentary-- especially during the credits.  The description promised I would cringe, and cringe I did, but not for lack of execution.  This guy's life is a train wreck, but like a real train wreck, it's hard to look away while it's happening.  Or like rotten milk: now that I've opened the bottle and sniffed it myself, I'm excited about sharing it with everyone else in the room.  Enjoy the bouquet, people!",1468368000,2,746,4.7
8392729,5,B003A02O4W,"It was the look and feel of a documentary; it is a Mockumentary.

What's the difference?

You get to be in on the joke.  Unlike reality TV that claims to be real (it's not).  (There is no conspiracy theory: Why do you think the shows stopped when there was a writer's strike?)

This is an experiment in filmmaking.

The actors had no idea what they were to do in each scene until they were given direction.  The script is improvisational.

The hookers portrayed are in this film are real not hookers, some are actors, many are just men and women pulled off the street.  Actually, the non-actors are pretty fabulous.  They are grade school teachers, people who were friends of friends, anyone with a pulse that was around when the film was being shot.

They seem like real people (because they are)...everyone who hates this film thinks they are real.

They are not.

That is why there are screen credits...so-and-so is playing so-and-so.

This film was shot in one take, scene by scene.

If you LIKE Indie films, Absurdism, Improvisation, Art House stuff, think you are smart, or are imaginative enough to say, ""what if"", or just enjoy watching everyone trying to think on their feet, in the moment, (having no idea what the outcome will be) you will more than likely think this film is a blast.  There are no take backs, and it is permanently on celluloid (so to speak).

If you are a moron looking for cheap pornography, you will NOT enjoy this film.  This film is designed to make fun of you, because you are an uneducated viewer and do not get the joke.  (Read the reviews of those who gave it one star as opposed to five stars.)  My point is made.

Women are objectified in this film.  Some feminists will tsk, tsk while others will applaud.  What's the difference?  Why they are objectified.  Once you know the answer, you know what kind of feminist you are (or are not).  Does it help if you know a woman produced it?  It really shouldn't.

Men are equally objectified in a different way...they are allowed ""To be silent and be thought a fool, or speak up and remove all doubt.""  They choose option two.

It is an equal opportunity offender.  If you think the lead guy is a horrible person, you have just given credit to the actor (who is nothing like this character...he is ACTING.)

If you are new to the Mockumentary genre, enjoy.  Probably there are people who still think Waiting for Guffman is real.  They will also hate this movie.  They also probably didn't like, Waiting for Guffman.

If you are a film nerd, you will get all the inside jokes, if not, now that the veil is dropped you should have a pretty good time.  If you don't, I doubt we would agree on much anyway.

This film was shot in 9 days with as many as 16 cameras running at once in different qualities.  If you know anything about film, you know what that means.

Have fun, and drink copious amounts of beer while you watch.

I had a great deal of fun watching it.  I was in on the joke.  Now, you are too.",1370908800,3,2987,4.4235727440147325
8392730,1,B003A02O4W,This is the worst movie/documentary that I have ever seen.  I'm pretty much speechless.  I never thought that I would be so disappointed with a movie that I could not even review it.  Off topic and it was thrown together in a jumbled mess.  Do not waste your money.  Were these guys on crack or what? Horrible...,1366761600,3,312,4.4035087719298245
8392731,5,B003A02O4W,"If you miss what independent films used to be, this one is for you.

This film is made in the dirty indie style you don't see anymore.

Social satire, music, broad sexual parody, gross guy humor, George Bush humping Lady Liberty, Karl Rove screwing Mt Rushmore: this film packs a lot into 104 minutes. And it criticizes the war in Irag.

Best enjoyed with friends and some beers, laughs are guaranteed.
