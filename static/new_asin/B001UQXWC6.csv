The ECHO BRIDGE DISASTER 4 FILM COLLECTOR'S SET is comprised of two double feature flipdiscs in separate keepcases that are housed in a thin paper cover. No booklets included, but liner notes for films are on back covers.

Clear transfers are in widescreen format. Stereo sound. ""Crash Landing"" has Dolby 5.1 surround and Spanish subtitles. There's only 5 chapter accesses for this one. The others provide 24 chapter jumps.

These three are from the ""Nature Unleashed"" series issued by indie GFT ENTERTAINMENT. They're mediocrities featuring unknown casts, and are the combined efforts of outfits based in Canada, UK and three Balkan nations.

3803370,3,B001UQXWC6,"While all four films offers, a little diversion, what it lacks are known stars, which in turn may have lead to better written scripts. My focus is on Fire: Nature Unleashed, I enjoyed this one.
Fast and Hot and characters expendible which isn't to say I didn't like the characters. There isn't much of a storyline, just pulse pounding action.  Picking a bad guy, that is debateable, I mean do I sneer at the fire, the hot head biker, or the maniac setting the fires.
The action is non stop, there is one noticable glaring moment and that is the fire, it is when we see our victims shown in front of the blaze, I could tell that, keying or putting our folks over the fire footage wasn't very good.

The characters over the burning scenes weren't clean inserts, however, the fire footage wasn't that bad.  Oh and there is that bald pyromaniac, oh brother, he's right from hell.  The lead character I liked and the three remaining friends.  As I said earlier, it is non action and I enjoyed the ride.  The other three films, well, they each have their moments, not enough to say that they are worth your time.",1391472000,,1106,4.4504950495049505

3803375,5,B001UQXWC6,"Plenty of thrills and spills in all the movies. Actors did a wonderful job convincing you it was happening and what more could you want. The effects are fantastic very real like, all are very different to each other and something for all. They are not as good as the big time movies, but not far from it so I graded them B plus. The story's are worth every bit of credit as I really enjoyed them all. From beginning to end they kept me wrapped up not wanting  to move in case something happened and I missed it. First class entertainment so much that happened I can't remember everything so I decided to let you be the judge and see for yourself so sit awhile relax take your shoes off and watch a fist full of dynamite of action with glee. Don't forget your popcorn.",1360972800,,767,4.2534246575342465
3803376,2,B001UQXWC6,Disaster 4 Film Collector's set  - not particularly inspiring so far. I have watched Earthquake and Fire and have to admit that if the other two are in any way similar then I can't consider this to be an exceptional buy,1296604800,4,219,4.341463414634147

8344662,3,B001UQXWC6,I enjoyed Avalanche and Crash Landing - the usual disaster stikes and its fun to watch the the stories unfold. What can one say about B movies - they're not intended for any awards ceremonies they're for fun. Earthquake was rather dull for my taste and Fire was so ridiculous at times it was funny but I'd watch it again - just to see the injured forget they were injured and then remember later.,1394409600,,396,4.364864864864865
