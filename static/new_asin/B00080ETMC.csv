2255224,5,B00080ETMC,"Gentle presentation of people living under difficult physical, social, and economic conditions. Multidimensional and not one sided. Yet a thinking person has much to ponder about human tenacity and adaptation, community, family, and character even in the face of economic exploitation. The characters are compelling and the kids come to life as people. This is a great production.

I have not seen the matter of child labor dealt with so deeply before. It is all the more powerful because it is not overdone as some ""Hollywood film"" might have presented the matter.

So where the heck is the second season? Was it ever even broadcast? Sorry to say I am suspicious that this series was too honest and too well done and ruffled some feathers and got shut down. The exploitation of miners in North America is still with us and this series goes beneath the surface and shows us how real, appealing, and sympathetic people -- families and wonderful children and not just the miners themselves -- are victimized and live in situations where there is not much they can do about it but try to carry on and be happy.

Coal ran the engines of modern society and various sorts of mining products still do. Who really would give up their profits and comforts and trade them for the lives of some brave boys and their dads down in the pits, and struggling families in the mining towns? This point was never shoved in our face, but a thinking person would think about it. This can be taken simply as a story about kids as people, or a family film, or it can be seen as a film with a message. One can enjoy the scenery and atmospherics. It can be appreciated at many levels.

It is sad to think that some people will not watch this because there is no second season. This could give the wrong impression.  I might not have watched it if I had I known in advance that there was no second season. But I am really, really glad that I did because half a filmed treasure is much better than no treasure. This show was certainly not terminated because it was so good!!!!!

Sorry again, but I am going to preach a bit. Kids today should see this not just because it is a kids film or a family film but I hope that it can get them to thinking how lucky they are to be able to have the opportunities to have childhoods and get educations and make something of themselves. We should try to stay conscious of the fact that we enjoy comforts and opportunities on the backs of people who did not and even today do not have such opportunities. I for one feel that there is something of a human debt implied and we should be thinking of how to pay it back by finding ways to make life better.  If your kids can watch this without having such things cross their minds, I would suggest you need to have a talk with them.",1336608000,2,2788,4.391472868217054

2255226,5,B00080ETMC,This series is one of the most interesting and entertaining we have ever viewed.  We hated to have it end.  The characters were so real to us and the story very compelling.,1266105600,4,172,4.34375
2255227,5,B00080ETMC,"I cannot say enough good things about this movie.  True to the times and heartache of the mines, this is an excellent film that is a must have in every collection. You can easily watch this a couple of times a year and never be bored with it.  It is more about the lives of people, not a horse flick. The ponies are just part of the overall story of the mines and a particular pony that is loved by a boy. Family and community is a very important thread.  I would have wanted more to the series!",1215561600,7,495,4.030612244897959
2255228,5,B00080ETMC,"I just cannont understand why they haven't released the second series of this wonderful story. It actually prompted me to travel from my home in Montana to Glace Bay, Nova Scotia to visit there and P.E.I. seeing the setting for Road to Avonlea. These programs should be made available for children. Also what's holding up more sets of Wind At My Back. These are great family entertainment programs that give you a realistic view of days gone by.",1201305600,10,445,4.717948717948718

2255230,5,B00080ETMC,"The first complete season is something we waited for after seeing the first ten episodes. We never knew this show existed and it is a shame it only lasted two seasons.  A great dramatic family show that draws you into the characters rather than the plot.  You wonder what is happening to each character.  The girl who plays Jennie is absolutely wonderful and the Ned character is top notch too.

We are waiting patiently for the second season so we can see Natalie MacMaster guest star.

If you liked Anne of Green Gables and the Avonlea series, you will love this series.  Not as carefree and happy go lucky as those shows, they show a poorer family struggling to make ends meet and provides a glimpse of a time where getting ahead was not as important as just surviving.",1123545600,25,772,4.517985611510792
8054922,5,B00080ETMC,"This series takes us back to an amazing time in 1904 on an island in Nova Scotia in Canada, a time and place that most of us never knew existed, and what an amazing series this is. Like all great films of great creativity and depth, this was produced in Canada, the bastion of quality entertainment which produced this 44-episode series over at span of 1 year in 1999 before it got cancelled. This series revolves around a coal mine (""the pit""), child labor, struggling families, a one-company town, and an amazingly resilient population that manages to survive day by day in this town of Glace Bay despite corporate greed, indifference, petty egomaniacs, and seemingly insurmountable odds to live a life of meaning. This series is as relevant to today's menagerie of seemingly chaotic life struggles as it was back then in 1904. I did not hear a single cuss word used in any episode and I consider this high quality entertainment.",1495843200,,931,4.753086419753086

It's entertaining, engaging, and tuned in to the kind of values I think most parents would want to instill in their kids (but it's not preachy at all).

8054928,5,B00080ETMC,"Great TV series about child labor in coal mines in Canada approximately 100 years ago.  We see life from the perspective of a sweet family, and mostly through the eyes of one good boy.  Great morals to the story.  Terrific acting.

8054930,5,B00080ETMC,It said complete but only had 26 episodes when should of been 44 episodes. But only 26 to season one. And now i guess there is no season 2 so missing all the rest now. I was disappointed that I don't have and can't get the rest of them. Not the sellers fault that I can't get them but could of said there where more to the series that we can't get.,1354492800,2,348,3.8472222222222223
