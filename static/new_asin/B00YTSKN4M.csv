7269311,5,B00YTSKN4M,"Peg+Cat A Totally Awesome Halloween is a fantastic DVD! This title is made up of four episodes entitled ""The Parade Problem"", ""The Halloween Problem"", ""The Highlight Zone Problem"" and ""The Bermuda Triangle Problem"". The episodes have colorful diverse characters, fun songs and lots of rhyming games and problem solving. Some of the issues approached include social responsibilities like recycling, helping others and healthy eating. The characters use math, identify shapes and colors and rely on each other to solve everyday problems. Each episode is Halloween themed and brings up important topics such as safety in numbers, trying healthy treats and remembering even the scariest costumes are just that, COSTUMES! The special features on this DVD include episode selection, play all, subtitles, DVI (descriptive video) and a link to www.pbs.org. I recommend this DVD to any children learning the fundamentals of math, shapes and colors. The songs are catchy and fun and make learning easy and enjoyable.

7269313,1,B00YTSKN4M,"Not a special Halloween video.  I ordered this with the idea that it was a new video released for Halloween.  In fact, it is just the episode from one of the seasons.  Really disappointing.  The whole packaging of this is misleading.  It says it is 60 minutes long and has no other pictures of anything but Halloween, front and back!  There are a few other episodes on the disk, which is also misleading to have consumers believe there will be a 60 minute Halloween special, like that of curious George.",1443830400,9,503,4.533333333333333

7269322,5,B00YTSKN4M,"Peg plus Cat, it such a cute show, so funny and very educational. I love how it teaches shapes and math. My 3 and 2 yr old watch this and he'll say things like "" look mom that tree is a triangle shape"" and "" my bagel in half is a semi-circle"". Math was probably my worst subject in school, so I like the idea of exposing them to math concepts in a fun way early, so they might grasp the ideas better when they start school. This is a Hallowwen one, I thought it was so cute, it's nice to have something on theme for Halloween without being too spooky for little ones. The dvd is quality and shipping was perfect.

8719249,5,B00YTSKN4M,"My son has learned so much from watching Peg + Cat.  When we play math games together, I am amazed at how much he knows.  The DVDs have taught him to count all the way to 20 (he would get stuck in the teens before), count to 100 by 10s, and do simple addition and subtraction problems.  He just barely turned 4.",1483747200,,311,3.9838709677419355
