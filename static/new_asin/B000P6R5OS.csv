8189501,5,B000P6R5OS,"There is no public access to ""the Gold Vault"" and this presentation is the only place that I am aware of where you can access motion picture footage of the interior of the Bullion Depository and gaze upon rooms filled with gold bars. The Bullion Depository is located on land within the Federal Reservation that is Fort Knox, but it is under separate management. Fort Knox is under the control of the United States Army, which comes under the Department of Defense. The Bullion Depository is controlled by the United States Mint and comes under the Department of the Treasury. In my several years of being stationed at Fort Knox, and in the two decades I have lived in the surrounding community, I have never been closer to the Gold Vault than to drive by on the road that passes in front of it. I would risk scaling the fence surrounding the White House a hundred times rather than chance climbing the Bullion Depository fence just once.
  The motion picture footage of Fort Knox is antiquated, but very interesting. In the Base Realignment and Closure (BRaC) plan introduced by the Clinton Administration, Fort Knox is no longer ""The Home of Armor and Cavalry"", and the Armor School has been relocated to Fort Banning, Georgia. The Patton Museum remains at Fort Knox, but it has been relieved of over three hundred tanks, guns, vehicles and ancillary equipment previously displayed in and around the museum, but which were the property of the Armor Center. Historical footage of the establishment of Camp Knox, Fort Knox and the Bullion Depository are all fascinating, educational and very entertaining.",1443657600,,1605,4.875457875457876

8189506,2,B000P6R5OS,"So what if there is no gold in Knox?  The U.S. has been off the gold standard for decades.  This film is so sensationalistic and overblown with weird soundtrack and 3 people who are described as simply attorney, professor and engineer.  How lame.  Just pure yellow journalism, film to make a buck... and not an ounce of gold to see either.",1320796800,,339,4.508196721311475
8189507,5,B000P6R5OS,Saw a few minutes of this show on tv and wanted to watch all of it because my boyfriend and I were currently stationed at Ft Knox. Great for sharing with the families. The footage from inside the vault is from the 70s and the training footage is a bit outdated too but still very interesting!,1293494400,,292,4.232142857142857
8189508,4,B000P6R5OS,"The program was quite interesting in regards to the main topic of Fort Knox (the gold depository), but I felt there was too much additionalinformation regarding the miltary aspect of the Fort's U.S. Army tank training facility included, perhaps unnecessarily.

Overall, the DVD provided a detailed report on the entire Fort Knox depository and the Fort Knox military facility, in concert, to bring the viewer a reasonably good overview of the subject.",1188864000,,451,5.263888888888889
