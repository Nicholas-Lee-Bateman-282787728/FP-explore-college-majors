7943422,3,B00005KCB2,"In this somewhat biographical satirical short comedy,
The GREATER than GREAT Barbra Streisand's Son
with Elliot Gould comes off rather timid, shy and simple,
although very easy to touch Your Heart-strings. With
tongue in cheek and sometimes a glimmer in His eye
He quietly takes pokes at His life in the Gigantic shadow
of His most famous Mother !
The other shorts are rather mundane.",1389052800,,384,4.923076923076923

7943424,4,B00005KCB2,"The ""Boys Life"" films are a mixed bag of goodies, each segment containing both good, and bad, films. Part 3 is by far my favorite entry. The first film, by Jason Gould, is pretty good and the rest are actually okay. But what makes this one my favorite of the three is the addition of the short film ""$30"" starring Sara Gilbert and Erik MacArthur, the best film from any of the ""Boys Life"" movies.
$30 tells the story of a father who surprises his closeted gay son with a prostitute (Gilbert) on his 18th birthday. My parents are of Armenian descent and in our culture, a father and son never truly bond until the father gets his 18-year old a prostitute. That is how I lost my virginity to a woman (ugh), therefore, I can relate to this sweet,good-natured tale.
It's light, funny, very touching and definitely recommended. If any gay man had trouble being acceptance (and I'm sure PLENTY did), then this is the film to see. Gilbert gives her client a night to remember--not because of sex, but because of acceptance. This is a beautiful and rewarding little film that deserves to be seen.",1049846400,4,1088,4.527918781725888
7943425,5,B00005KCB2,"Great films. Great Directors.  Not many continuing film series are as consistent or rewarding as the Boy's Life series.  I became a major cheerleader for the first two ('His cousin Nunzio' is still the best film in the series), and I'm already fluffing my pom-poms for the third.",1005436800,3,279,4.791666666666667
7943426,2,B00005KCB2,"Let me get one thing out of the way. Don't buy this dvd thinking you'll see more of the beauty who's on the jacket. He's a straight character - in bed with his girlfriend - in one of the short films and is on screen for about 2 minutes.
The first segment was written, directed, and performed by Jason Gould (that's Barbra S.'s and Elliot's son). It's ok. Maybe I don't expect as much from a short subject as I do from a feature-length, but i found that it did hold my interest. Young Mr. Gould plays the son of famous parents, and he has trouble keeping men interested. It doesn't appear that he has the charisma or the talent that his parents have. He's had a comfortable, but a somewhat unhappy life. Shrinks. Anti-depressant therapy. All right, so it isn't ""Taxi Driver,"" but it is interesting to have some insight into what it might be like being a child of someone famous, and having to cope with that fame indirectly.
The rest of the shorts are, sadly, completely forgettable. I really like gay cinema, but gay cinema has to meet the same criteria as other films in order to be deemed worthwhile. Two stars. Maybe they should hold off on another collection until they have some better stuff to collect.",1004140800,18,1208,4.470588235294118
