8464493,2,B005BX3NJ6,"The first DVD is very nice but the second it's a compilation of some bonus performances but none of them is complete they just cut them, in other words the idea of a second DVD is to be able to charge you more for really nothing extra worthy.",1349395200,3,242,4.0625
8464494,4,B005BX3NJ6,"I recommend this DVD.  If you like some of these artists you'll enjoy this DVD and likely discover some new artists you'll enjoy.

I have just three criticisms:

1. The audio mix is excellent, but is two channel stereo only. I would have loved to hear this with surround sound.

2. The video work is very good, but it would have been better if they used better quality cameras and matched the cameras better.

3. It should also be available in HD on a Blu-Ray disc.

There is nothing wrong with the artistry and craft that went into this disc, the improvements I would have liked to see would have cost more money. Perhaps the market for this type of product is too small to justify the extra investment.",1349308800,3,704,4.4186046511627906
8464495,5,B005BX3NJ6,"These are the best of the best, live. The quality of the video & the performances are fantastic. I bought this as a birthday gift for my adult son, we share the same taste in music. We both loved it. If you like fusion, you will want to get this bad boy.",1343347200,,254,3.9038461538461537
8464496,5,B005BX3NJ6,"This is a amazing DVD full of rich performances from some of the most amazing musicians in Jazz Rock. Alex Machacek who kicks off the film plays beautifully supported by Jeff Sipe. The Indo-Fusion set of Ranjit Barot gives a world music flavor (Check out is record Bada Boom), Human Element is rocking and Jimmy Herring, wow !! His set might be the most powerful set in the entire DVD. Wayne Krantz set is one long tune with the one and only Anthony Jackson, Lenny White from Return to Forever is beautiful with Tom Guarna and Jimmy Herring as the guest guitarist. John McLaughlin jams with Zakir Hussain in an outstanding set. The Bonus DVD has some interesting and intuitive interviews, an All Star Tribute to John McLaughlin. This DVD is well shot, fantastic audio. The DVD can be cherished for many years to come.",1330300800,10,817,4.641379310344828
8464497,2,B005BX3NJ6,"Mostly these guys all sound like someone else, Alan Holdsworth, Jeff Beck, Joe Zawinul and others. Very little originality or substance. And how come fusion guitarists never have good tone? It is well recorded I'll say that much.",1327190400,,229,5.052631578947368
8464498,5,B005BX3NJ6,"This 2-DVD set is a precious discovery which broadens my knowledge about the contemporary masters in Jazz guitar (and other geniuses) in addition to the undisputed great Mahavishnu (happy belated 70th birthday to John by the way).
Fast and save delivery, hence great consumer satisfaction.",1326240000,6,289,5.444444444444445
