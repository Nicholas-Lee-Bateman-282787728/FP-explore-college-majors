8046556,4,B00079YOWO,"This volume in the ""'Lost in Space' Collector's Edition"" (Volume 39 out of 41 if you are actually keeping count) offers up a couple of late third season episodes.  By this point ""Lost in Space"" the end was in sight, which makes it ironic that they finally get to Alpha Centauri, their original destination.  This is one of those combinations here the rating splits the difference between the two episodes:

Episode 78, ""The Promised Planet"" (Written by Peter Packer, First aired January 24, 1968) has the Jupiter II landing on a planet named Delta in the Alpha Centauri star system.  The Robinsons are greeted by a bunch of humanoids who look and act like Hippies from Earth, the difference being that this bunch never grows old.  Apparently they have been living like this for so long that they want to age normally and they come up with this complicated plan where the older Robinsons leave in the Jupiter II with the kids staying behind to be used in a scientific experiment.  Apparently Dr. Smith counts as one of the younger crowd in this one, which is just another reason that this is a below average episode.  Gil Rogers plays Bartholomew and Keith Taylor is Edgar.  Pay attention to the ""pad"" of these hippies and see if you see something fab that is out of place.

Episode 79, ""Fugitives in Space"" (Written by Robert Hamner, First aired January 31, 1968) adds insult to injury for Don West (Mark Goddard) as he is sent to a prison camp with Dr. Smith (Jonathan Harris) for helping an escaped prisoner.  Of course the fun here is watching these two characters, who have hated each other from day one without any reason to change their first impressions, work together to save themselves.  You get the feeling this is one of those episodes where they figured the two characters should get an episode together before the series was cancelled.  Of course Will and the Robot get arrested for attempting to help the prisoners escape and there is actually a halfway decent twist to this one in which the Jupiter II crew are just along for the ride.  ""Iron"" Mike Conrad is under all that makeup as the prisoner Creech, with Tol Avery as the Warden and Charles Horvarth as the guard.  This is the better of the two episodes and not just be default.",1117324800,,2248,4.615577889447236
