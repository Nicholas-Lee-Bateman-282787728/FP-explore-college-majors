4263786,5,B0045YGPUQ,"Excellent,not a who done it with all the twists but with regular people...guard (cop) doing his rural police work. Lots of interesting and everyday characters, great acting and good drama. Slice of everyday life in rural Ireland (tea and biscuits).",1512172800,19,248,5.225
4263787,5,B0045YGPUQ,Good series.  It is a shame that it was only for two seasons.  Second year was very good and more character building for Jack.,1501545600,5,126,4.208333333333333

4263789,3,B0045YGPUQ,"This was ok. It was a little slow moving for my taste but the acting and story lines are good.  This is not as good as The Bill, but worth watching. The episodes are just too long for what is needed.",1356393600,5,199,3.8536585365853657
4263790,5,B0045YGPUQ,I really enjoyed this show.  Good drama without the over the top feel of an American police procedural.,1522886400,,103,4.722222222222222
4263791,5,B0045YGPUQ,Love this series. Beautiful scenery and I think I am in love with the sergeant and I am over 70 !!!,1522800000,,99,3.761904761904762

4263793,5,B0045YGPUQ,"This brief series was outstanding in many ways, for example: character-building, acting, writing and landscapes. I's a pity it ended after just two seasons. Mr. McDonnell is a fine actor.",1521936000,,187,5.266666666666667

4263797,5,B0045YGPUQ,Interesting and different. Characters are complex and the show has many twists and turns.,1521158400,,89,5.428571428571429
4263798,5,B0045YGPUQ,"Excellent  who done it. placed in a  quite believable  West of Ireland location.  RTE did a great job placing the protagonist back in a community in which he has deep roots , but which  he never truly knew.",1520985600,,206,4.315789473684211
4263799,5,B0045YGPUQ,so easy to watch. no gratuitous sex or violence. well acted. thoughtful stories. well developed characters. how rare. how refreshing,1520985600,,132,5.65
4263800,4,B0045YGPUQ,"I liked this film very much,although some scenes of landscape and roadways were prolonged.  But for the most part, the pacing of the film captured the silent conspiracy of evil and the victims of evil while contrasting the beauty of the landscape with the darkness of the conspirators.  Having said that, I do think it could do without the interminable driving scenes and the intrusive piano.",1520985600,,392,4.924242424242424
4263801,4,B0045YGPUQ,"This is a pretty solid show. Many reviewers have commented on the pace, which at times, can be a bit slow. However, I think, particularly for American viewers, this is because so many of our crime procedural dramas race through and wrap everything up in a cool 45-50 minutes. This series is a slow burn, full of shades-of-gray characters with a pacing that seems closer to reality than much of the shows we get stateside which set unrealistic expectations for the realities of crime fighting. It's not exactly a feel good series (I hate to say I was pleased when one of the characters died as I thought he was such a rank bastard), but I think it is much more reflective of the realities of the environment in which the series is playing out.

The cinematography is pretty darn solid as well, and the show offers up stunning views of the Irish countryside in both tight and beautifully wide shots.",1520899200,,897,4.571428571428571
4263802,2,B0045YGPUQ,"It's kind of like the BBC funded the standard PC authors (with issues left over anti-Irish sentiment) to write the story lines and then some self-loathing Irish writers added even more crap. The actors did fine but the stories were slow and plodding & rather odd at times.  The characters are all fairly unsavory with very few redeeming qualities.  Maybe if I visit Ireland more often I'd find that this isn't TV Ireland and the authors are giving us a very real view. But I haven't found that to be the case and if it is, maybe we'd all be better off visiting other places.",1520812800,,574,4.457142857142857
4263803,4,B0045YGPUQ,"excellent series!!! excellent casting!! the lead is low-key, not prone to silly ""star"" heroics or solving skills. each episode ties to the next, although each stands alone, as well. doesn't feel the need to ""previous episode"" us to tears or make all endings happy. good stories, good characters, fallible humans are everywhere.",1520380800,,327,5.3076923076923075
4263804,1,B0045YGPUQ,"After six episodes and .to conclude that crime does pay and all can be forgiven once you wrap everything up with a golden ribbon is
sad and contrive. Sorry I wasted my time with this pretentious piece of junk.",1519862400,,209,4.384615384615385
4263805,5,B0045YGPUQ,Excellent crime series set in rural Ireland . The characters are everyday people with weaknesses and strengths who make compromises as so often happens in real life. I  don't want to say too much without revealing the stories. I was impressed with season 1 and I'm watching season 2. Although initially slow moving the acting is very good and you get hooked. I would recommend watching for yourself with cc if you have trouble with the Irish accent. However the closed captions were not always correct in season 1.,1519862400,,514,4.775280898876405
4263806,2,B0045YGPUQ,"I keep falling asleep while watching this series. What they drag out into two 50 minute episodes should be resolved in one. I am part way into season 2, but I doubt I will finish it. Love the scenery.",1519862400,,200,4.153846153846154
4263807,5,B0045YGPUQ,"This series was wonderful for many reasons...the place...the stories, but mainly the characters. l loved the fact that there was so many characters to really like. There seems to be this trend of just watching a thong of people you care little about, thank goodness this is not one of them!",1519516800,2,290,4.705882352941177
4263808,5,B0045YGPUQ,This was a great series and never boring. The setting is in rural beautiful Ireland with breathtaking views of the coast.  I like movies where the actors closely resemble the characters they play as this one does.  The main characters are flawed and yet loveable.  The bad guys also look the part they play and easy to dislike.  The crimes are horrific and realistic but not gory.,1519257600,2,380,4.626865671641791
4263809,5,B0045YGPUQ,Excellent cast & storyline!! I binged this fantastic show in 2 sittings. Owen McDonnell is my new crush!,1518998400,,104,4.833333333333333
4263810,5,B0045YGPUQ,Great...gets better with every episode!,1518912000,,39,7.0
4263811,3,B0045YGPUQ,"This is not one of the first rate series I have come to expect from across the pond. The lead character is a ""self righteous pr**k"" who antagonizes everyone, sometimes with cause and sometimes without. All the remaining characters are manipulative and scheming, including his own family. And, the mysteries tend to be predictable. All that said, it held my interested enough to finish the series. I didn't love it, but still consider it better than most TV shows.",1518825600,,463,4.8734177215189876
4263812,4,B0045YGPUQ,"Well, I liked it and I found the characters very real, some vile, some pathetic, some appealing. There was at least one of every major type. I identified with the male lead and his need to do the right thing and track down the bad guys, make them accountable and prevail in the end. The teenage prostitute was really a pretty good accounting of how that trash goes down. Don't think I'd have sneaked into the pimp's house to rescue her and then stayed to talk. The 17-year-old did a great job playing a bitchy little 'ho', and her sauciness, alternating with self-doubt and truly unlikable behavior mirrored 13-16 year olds pretty well. The scenery is spectacular, and that's saying something as I live in one of the most beautiful parts of Alaska.",1518739200,7,748,4.631578947368421
4263813,4,B0045YGPUQ,I did like Single-Handed but it was pretty dreary and foreboding.  The characters were well developed.  There were a few times the plot moved forward and I was left wondering  how did that happen?  I do recommend it and hope you enjoy the mystery!,1518739200,,247,4.545454545454546
4263814,5,B0045YGPUQ,Excellent story line that drew me in at the beginning and surprise relationships that were again surprising and made me want to watch it all in a couple of sittings. The scenery is haunting in the vast coastline of Ireland and part of the story. I hope we see season 2 please!!,1518566400,,277,4.346153846153846
4263815,5,B0045YGPUQ,Very interesting storylines. Well acted and directed.,1518566400,,53,6.714285714285714
4263816,5,B0045YGPUQ,This show starts off slow but def grows on you and Jack Driscoll  too.  A bit far fetched bc its hard to believe a  town in quiet Connemara could be riddled with murder and miserable people.  It does  make me want to go back to Connemara though for a real visit instead of that crappy day tour.  It was so beautiful and such a pitty i was only there for a few hours.,1518480000,,366,3.9452054794520546
4263817,4,B0045YGPUQ,"The pace is a bit slow and the characters aren't particularly lovable. But the characters have more appeal than one might gather from other reviews, and, with the pace, the characters contribute verisimilitude to realistic plots that have enough twists to be entertaining.

I award 5 stars for Season 2. I'd also award 5 stars for season 1 were it not for apparently incompetent editing. It is impossible to explain without revealing more than some would want to know in advance. So, if spoilers upset you, stop reading.
***Spoilers***

In the first pair of episodes, it is key that the victim is pregnant, but nowhere do we learn how Jack is told.

That is a bit unnerving but not as much as an unforgivable lapse in third pair of episodes. Fairly early in an encounter with a former girlfriend, it becomes clear that, despite attempted concealment, Jack has somehow learned that she is a cop on special assignment. Nothing indicates how, and missing details seem to flavor everything that follows. Lacking that information, I only reluctantly watched the rest of it. The omission proved not to be fatal, but it was unnerving.

I have no complaints about season 2.",1518393600,,1165,4.839195979899498
4263818,5,B0045YGPUQ,"As most of the reviews have stated, the characters aren't likable.  They are complex.  Just like real people.  This is obviously not Hollywood.  Not every actor has a perfect body or perfect teeth or makes perfect choices.  Every day is not sunny.  In fact it is nearly always overcast or raining.  In the first episode we see Jack as a idealistic and out of his depth new sergeant and his father as a lovable and loved retired Garda.  As the layers peel back we see some of the brutal actions and choices the father took and we see Jack compromising his ideals as he walks in his father's shoes.",1518393600,7,596,4.4036697247706424
4263819,5,B0045YGPUQ,"I really enjoyed this series. It is not a high action fast paced violent series, more focus on character development and plot. Small rural town policeman solving crimes, murders, with family drama and local corruption.",1518307200,,218,5.257142857142857
4263820,5,B0045YGPUQ,Just the kind of series I like.  I felt like I was watching what was happening in real time.  Hope to season 3 soon.,1518220800,,116,3.7916666666666665
4263821,2,B0045YGPUQ,"Jack Driscoll shacks up with his cousin's fiancee after knowing them for about a week, and he can't seem to understand what's wrong with that. (Gemma is so annoying!) Then he gets way too close to a teenage prostitute. He thinks his old man just frightened people to keep them in line. Well Jack is scary enough on his own.",1518220800,,323,4.4
4263822,2,B0045YGPUQ,"The only reason I finished the series was because it was like watching a train wreck. I hated most of the characters with a passion, and I was hoping it would end like Hamlet, with all of the main characters' deaths, but SPOILER ALERT: most of the characters you hate the most just keep getting rewarded for their character flaws. Maybe that was the point and the artistic vision driving this. Somehow I doubt it. Bad tempered, unintelligent, immoral characters I can deal with, but they don't have to be so monochromatic.",1518220800,2,522,4.684782608695652

4263824,5,B0045YGPUQ,"I've watched this series several times.  It has good plots that mix conflict, mystery and romance and adds complex characters and beautiful west Irish scenery.  The English is totally understandable, no captions of subtitles required.  The main character tries to retain his integrity while those around him collude, cover up and avoid and deny responsibility.",1518048000,,360,5.509090909090909
4263825,5,B0045YGPUQ,"I loved both seasons.  Loved the actors, plot lines,scenery, everything.  What i didn't like is there aren't more seasons.  Hope that changes!  Why is Brit tv so much better than US??",1518048000,,183,4.806451612903226
4263826,2,B0045YGPUQ,Another jewel of their Irish taint.  Even in their own TV series they make themselves look like actual retarded bog-trotters.  Triumph!,1518048000,,135,5.380952380952381
4263827,2,B0045YGPUQ,"Started to watch Episode 1 of the first season on Prime last night and had high hopes for it, seeing all the four star ratings from previous viewers -- and that it was set in rural Ireland. Thud. Scenery aside, I'd not want to know or have to interact on a regular basis with most of these people. None seemed particularly engaging (whether a good guy or a bad guy or somewhere in-between) or even interesting enough to make me want to come back to know more about them. About 2/3rds of the way into Episode 1, I just said ""enough of this."" Click.",1518048000,2,547,4.269230769230769
4263828,2,B0045YGPUQ,"I watched the first two episodes and the plot twist at the end of episode two made me decide I didn't want to watch any more. Of all the places the writer could have gone with the plot, this was far-fetched and seemed like it was just used for shock value.",1517961600,3,256,4.03921568627451
4263829,3,B0045YGPUQ,"This series had so much potential, but it was wrapped up too soon.  The characters weren't allowed to develop after season 1, and too much effort was spent leading season 2 to its conclusion.",1517961600,,191,4.617647058823529
4263830,3,B0045YGPUQ,"So far, I've only watched the first 2 storylines...the acting is very good, the scenery is wonderful (Ireland is a gorgeous country after all) but as with many other reviewers here, I find that even the main character *Jack* is the only one in the entire rural area here who has any redeeming qualities at all. I feel for him ~ he is moral, trying his best to do his job, but he is too restricted by his father, others (mother included), and sometimes even his own faults, to do what is completely right.
As with others, as well, I know better than to think that my own people are so selfish, cowardly and immoral.",1517961600,6,614,4.3478260869565215

4263833,3,B0045YGPUQ,"I think a lot of the 5 and 4 star reviewers are confusing the beauty of Ireland with the story and the acting.  Ireland is gorgeous and the photography here was very good, but the characters were unlikeable, pigheaded, and I hope to heck the Irish are not like that.  No one here was likeable or admirable - the male lead was an idiot, who couldn't keep one woman but was all over the map with his sexual partners.  His mother was a pigheaded enabler who worshipped her male chauvinist pig of a husband.  the male leader was too much of a coward to tell his mother what her husband was really like.  No one in this show was admirable or even likable. In the last episodes, the teenaged prossie was a pain in the arse who blamed everyone else for the pigheaded choices she made herself.  Only the scenery made it endurable.  I trust the real Irish are not this stupid or self-centered.",1517788800,4,884,4.353658536585366

4263844,3,B0045YGPUQ,"Overall, the acting was good, but I did not like the series.  If this is supposed to represent a slice of life in rural Ireland, I pray I never have to go there.  Relationships among people who supposedly care for each other are riddled with hypocrisy, duplicity, and brutality.  No one can be trusted.

Set in the outskirts of Ireland, which the show goes to great lengths to remind the viewer (quite effectively I might add) that though it's beautiful, there's a history of suffering, and profound poverty.  The locals, especially the young people can feel isolated and perhaps trapped at times.

This is great story telling in my opinion.  None of the characters are over the top good, or bad.  Seems more like real people.  Most small town cop shows exaggerate the amount of pure violence taking place, to make it more interesting for the viewer.  But this show doesn't fall into that trap. It's more about personality conflict, and the problems of growing up in a town where everyone knows everyone else's business.  Perhaps that is why when secrets exist, they are buried deep, for that very reason....",1527206400,,1083,5.0790960451977405

8416891,4,B0045YGPUQ,"Gardai Sargeant Jack Driscoll has some experience under his belated so he feels more up to the job. There is always an undercurrent of someone else who is barking the orders, and he has an idea of who it is. But coming from a family of police, he knows the rules.

Driscoll keeps running into the same sort of problems, but at this point he is able to control situations. A romance comes into the picture, and that plays out until it doesnt.  Cool, calm and collected is the name of Jacks game, and he is continuing the family name.

I also would not want to live in this town. A great deal of crime for an out of the way place. No one seems very friendly or trusting.  Even the ""good guys"" were not very likable.  Maybe that is an accurate depiction of the people living in this area.  I hope not.",1522886400,,525,3.869158878504673
