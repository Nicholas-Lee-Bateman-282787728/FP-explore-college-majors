7803021,5,6300132692,"Synopsis:  A psychopathic plastic surgeon transforms a young accident victim into the spitting image of his missing daughter.  Taglines:  A face created by a master surgeon ... to live a lie created by a madman;  He lost the face of the woman he loved ... so he gave it to someone else;  Don't let Doctor Reynolds get his hands on you!; The cutting edge of Terror;  Her face was his fortune!  ""Scalpel"" is a throwback to the films of Alfred Hitchcock, but with a more modern touch and a bit of sleaze.  It stars the handsome Robert Lansing and the charismatic Judith Chapman (The Young and the Restless, One Life to Live, and As the World Turns) who has graced many a soap opera on television, usually playing the antagonist.  In this film, she also plays a naughty, wicked woman who discovers that her face can make her very, very rich.  This is a neat little thriller that is very amusing and quite fun at times, especially during a scene in which miss Chapman is chased through a forest wearing a very sexy bikini.  We need this film on DVD so others can enjoy it's charms.",1511395200,,1076,4.438775510204081
7803022,4,6300132692,"Largely unseen low budget thriller about an arrogant plastic surgeon named Dr Phillip Reynolds (Robert Lansing) who turns a plain Jane victim of a serious accident actually named Jane (Judith Chapman) into the spitting image of his daughter.  Why would he do such a thing?  Well Phillip's father cut him completely out of his will and left 5 million dollars to his daughter Heather--but nobody seems to know where Heather is.  Phillip's plan is to coach the accident victim so she can pass as his daughter and collect the inheritance, which she will then split with him.  The fact that Dr Reynolds doesn't seem concerned that his real daughter might show up seems to suggest that she might have met a grisly fate that the rest of the family is unaware of.

Scalpel was clearly made on a modest budget with little in the way of polish or production values and also can't be said to be fast paced or action packed--it's a movie that moves at a fairly relaxed pace that may turn off impatient viewers.  But while Scalpel doesn't look like much in its early scenes the disarmingly clever script is filled with twists that make the movie strange and surprisingly unpredictable--every time I thought I knew where Scalpel was headed it turned out I was wrong.

Considering that the leads Robert Lansing and Judith Chapman are both TV actors who worked regularly but were never stars their performances are surprisingly strong--adding further under-the-radar quality to a movie that received very little distribution in theaters or home video.  Scalpel is worth tracking down and will reward viewers looking for something that is offbeat and unpredictable.",1424649600,2,1648,4.924187725631769
7803023,5,6300132692,"I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT YEAR THE MOVIE WAS MADE , BUT i BELIEVE IT WAS BETWEEN 1973 AND 1976 . I REMEMBER THE TIME PERIOD SO WELL BECAUSE IT WAS FILMED IN THE SMALL HOSPITAL WHERE i SERVED IN the Emergency Room. In fact , it was Shallowford Community Hospital , in Dunwoody Georgia . Mr. Lansing had the entire hospital enthralled , his very deep voice and presence was infectious . What I remember most was the electrical cables , lights and cameras all over the little hospital. ( Only 2 floors and about 150 bed capacity ). A special memory for those of us that were there.  The movie was about a 6-7/10 , but those of us that were there during the filming , we felt a bit special , sharing our little cafeteria with Robert Lansing and the rest of the entourage from Hollywood , who put our little hospital on the map.",1374796800,2,824,4.215189873417722
7803024,3,6300132692,"I don't know why this well-made little Georgia-made Hitchcockian crime melodrama isn't better known.
Psychopathic plastic surgeon Robert Lansing wants to inherit the family millions which have been willed to his daughter, Judith Chapman, but Chapman took off over a year ago and can't be located.  Solution?  Simple.  Use those plastic surgery skills, and make another daughter.
Lansing gets his opportunity when a mauled strip club dancer shows up in his hospital one night, minus her face.  Right height, identical build, similar voice.  The girl goes along with Lansing's scheme, studying the part to play before the family, in return for half the inheritance.  Nothing could possibly go wrong.
Unless, of course, the real daughter shows up...
The only things working against this wonderful little low-budgeter are a chintzy Robert Cobert score (Dark Shadows) and the low budget, itself.  But the script  -  by director John M. Grissmer  -  is taut, the direction is good, and Lansing and Chapman are terrific.  Chapman, especially, gets to display her skills, playing the missing daughter and the go-go girl made over in her image.  Lansing is hardly outdone, though  -  he's a remarkably believable and incredibly scary screen psychopath.
This sleazy Southern potboiler is sleek and sexy, well worth blowing the dust off of and rediscovering.",1030752000,9,1347,5.258215962441315
