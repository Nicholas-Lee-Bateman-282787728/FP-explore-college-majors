1971435,5,B00015401Y,"At last I have found a real instructional video using progressively more challenging, yet attainable positions.  I am guilty of purchasing not once, but twice (!) that 'W' pilates system.  Once when it was quite new and I went away shaking my head wondering why anyone would let themselves in for major lawsuits because of wrecked backs due to such poor instruction. And a second time, wanting the perceived benefits, but finding a lot of money spent on a lot of fluff.  Then too, there was all that chatter.  The McCook video shows an expert at his art.  Why else would an individual want to see anything else?  All I need do is look in a mirror and easily see someone who can't do the position. And I don't need to see all those who can, without a prayer and recipe on how to get there.  The McCook video is very well explained, but not directed to a kindergartner. It is specific and to the point.  One can go as far as they wish, stop the tape and begin again on another day.  Each day tempts you to go further and further, and each day that you do 'whatever', your conditioning and body image grows 'better and better'. Awesome job!",1113782400,,1137,4.376190476190477
1971436,5,B00015401Y,I am fairly new to both pilates and yoga.  I have been alternating videos or doing one then the other.  This video melds them together beautifully and his instruction is the best I've seen at adjusting your movements while flowing through them.  Also he takes just a few very important minutes at the beginning to go over some very important points on form and breathing.  I was very impressed and the voice over was perfect.  I think that with the alternate movements he gives most people could do this video.,1102291200,,510,4.622222222222222
1971437,5,B00015401Y,"This is a great workout designed by Tom McCook, whose talents as a Pilates and Yoga teacher really show! By the end of the 45 minute flow practice, I felt like I got a super workout and at the same time felt physically and mentally restored.
I like the way the exercises are sequenced, beginning with warm-up stretches and Pilates movements, then leading into flowing Yoga poses. The Pilates exercises really help establish a good mind-body connection and get you into your core. So the Yoga poses feel safer on the back and joints. I find I can go a lot deeper into the Yoga postures without creating strain.
There's an instructional Basics section prior to the Flow portion of the video which explains proper body positioning, breathing, weight bearing prinicipals - these are a good prep for the Flow.
Overall, Tom McCook gives excellent instruction with a calming and pleasant voice. This video gets better each time I follow it!",1073606400,4,933,4.801242236024844

For the past month, I reach only for this one - it meets all my needs in a quick 45 minutes - it gets all the kinks out, I find it relaxing, and I can feel my abs again. Highly recommend if your are getting bored of your yoga videos...",1153612800,5,497,4.242105263157895
1971439,5,B00015401Y,"A gentle workout, and the 45 min flies by!  Tom McCook is a great instructor.  I do this workout on my tired days and take the time to work on form.  I definitely feel it the next day.",1143676800,9,184,3.789473684210526
1971440,5,B00015401Y,I have grown to rely on this great video.  I get a full body workout and feel relaxed and centered afterwards.  Tom McCook's voice is smooth and encouraging and he definitely knows what he is doing.  I read somewhere that his studio was rated #1 in the entire Bay Area.  I love this video and would definitely recommend it!,1120176000,12,323,4.423728813559322
1971441,5,B00015401Y,"I am your typical 40 something american male, a weekend warrior, attempting to recapture my youth. At the end of the day, I have more aches and pains to show for my missguided belief that I can actually hang with the youngsters. So I decided to take a new approach on a recommendation from an older friend who successfully completes marathons and triathalons. ""Pilates, just do it. You will be able to train smarter with well stretched muscles"". And the DVD he recommended is this DVD. Results are amazing. I have less post exercise pain, better endurance and I can actually touch my toes (I couldn't even do that in High School). This DVD is truly amazing for improving my quality of workout.",1119916800,24,693,4.642276422764228
1971442,5,B00015401Y,This is a great balanced workout combining both pilates and yoga postures to extend & open the body while grounding & building your core. It keeps you constantly moving and provides well thought out voice instruction to lead you through the series. I also find it to be a great travel companion - very easy to do in any hotel room and a great way to help beat jetlag! I'm looking forward to the next video.,1119657600,10,406,4.355263157894737
1971443,5,B00015401Y,"I used this video to help rebuild all the muscles needed for core stability after a low back injury.  I tried a lot of methods and this video offers consistancy and lessons to carry through out my day which I think was the reason I have healed.  I also used ball therapy but have given this to friends who also have injured or have weak low backs.  Realizing that the core muscles keep the spine active and supported was one of the best lessons I have learned in understanding my body.  Thanks Tom!  Hey - the credits are pretty good too!  Love to see a little humor, especially after a good work out!  Keep em' coming!",1119657600,10,619,4.2844827586206895
1971444,5,B00015401Y,"Hey guys, this DVD is really a great blend of the best of yoga and pilates.  The beginning section gives you the basics, and explains why they are important.  And the workout section takes you right thru a strong workout that flows perfectly from one body part to the next.

I teach yoga and find that this DVD is a perfect complement to a pure yoga practice.  The pilates component gives you the core strength that enables you to do yoga poses and movement safely.  I highly recommend it to my students, particularly at the intermediate level.  So many videos & DVDs get flat after a few workouts because they don't get deep enough into the work.  McCook's 40-minute workout has staying power - it really goes deep and is a practice that you won't grow out of.",1119657600,13,761,4.471014492753623
1971445,5,B00015401Y,This program is great for someone on the go.  I take this with me and do the exercises on the road.  I play the DVD on my laptop.  I don't need any gear and I can get in a great workout.,1119571200,,186,3.4878048780487805
1971446,5,B00015401Y,I really enjoyed this DVD series.  Hard at times but overall a great way to bring the yoga/pilates routine right to your home! I recommend this DVD as a great way to augment your training.,1119571200,2,188,4.371428571428571
1971447,3,B00015401Y,"This sequence is for those who are already intermediate/advanced in their practice of both yoga and pilates.

Don't get this if you are new to yoga - the author does not give sufficient instruction, and in fact his alignment is off in some of the poses. Also, I'd suggest doing your own warm up sequence before even starting the workout as the author starts up right away in some demanding stretches.

Also if you are experienced in yoga and pilates, you may be disappointed in the duration of the flow sequence - it was too short for a yogi to get much satisfaction in the workout.",1119225600,15,582,4.481132075471698

8006592,3,B00015401Y,"I love pilates, so I can always get something out of a pilates video. But I would prefer the instructor to be encouraging and appealing. This guy is boring as all get out! He makes the challenge to exercise even more challenging because we have to put up with his stiff character!",1291593600,,280,4.403846153846154
8006593,4,B00015401Y,"This DVD is great for a day when you would like a lighter workout or an ""off"" day. It might be a little challenging for a beginner, not so much if you have been doing Pilates and Yoga for a while. It's perfect for those days when I don't want to work out.",1215388800,,255,3.830188679245283
8006594,5,B00015401Y,"Tom McCook presents a fairly serious workout with a nice flowing style. Before trying these exercises it might be best to have a basic knowledge of Yoga and Pilates. The pacing during the sun salutations is rapid and the exercises required a great deal of upper arm strength.

The first half of the routine is Pilates where you may recognize Sit Ups, The Hundred, Roll Up, Rolling like a Ball, Single Leg Stretch, Double Leg Stretch, Scissors, Saw, Open Leg Rocker and a complete Swan (no preparation it is the full exercise).

Tom McCook transitions into Cat/Cow and then into Sun Salutation A and Sun Salutation B. During the Yoga segment you will be moving through Downward Facing Dog, Plank, Triangle, Chair and Bridge. Each posture is held just as long as needed to feel the burn. By doing Yoga right after Pilates you may notice that you feel very calm and centered after the workout.

Overall I felt I had an excellent workout and can recommend this highly to anyone who is intermediate to advanced. Beginners may become frustrated with the lack of detailed instruction and the rapid transitions from standing to the floor and back again in the sun salutations.

8006595,5,B00015401Y,"I purchased this DVD for my swim team so that we could develop the skills and strength necessary to become more effective athletes and healthier humans. We love it. It is easy to understand, simple to follow, effective if you do it right and it works. Highly recommended.",1185667200,,271,4.666666666666667
8006596,4,B00015401Y,"I enjoy this DVD and pull it out often. It's a nice length (runs a little longer than the running time listed, closer to an hour), and a good combination of moves. The yoga moves are pretty easy though, so I do other yoga tapes when I want more, but the combination with the Pilates moves is what keeps me coming back. Good overall conditioning video.",1168387200,,351,4.333333333333333
8006597,4,B00015401Y,"This DVD by Pilates/yoga instructor Tom McCook offers a Pilates mat workout which moves into a series of flowing yoga postures.  The ""for Balance"" part of the title seems to refer to a balance between the two disciplines, as the practice does not focus on balance poses.  The main menu is as follows:  Introduction, 3 minutes (brief overview by Tom); Basics, 6 minutes (review of Pilates breathing and other principles); Flow Practice, 45 minutes.  Tom teaches via voiceover with no music.

Tom begins the practice with Pilates.  Starting in a standing position, he performs several warm-ups, including roll downs and side bends.  He then moves into a lunge with chest stretch and extends the lunge to a partial split.  Transitioning to a lying position, he moves the knees from side to side and performs toe touches before beginning a more traditional Pilates mat series.  Exercises here include the hundred, roll ups, leg circles, the series of five (skipping the double straight leg stretch), spine stretch forward, saw, open leg rocker, flight, swan, one leg bow stretch, elbow plank/side elbow plank, child's pose, and shoulder stretch (variation of dolphin pose).  He then performs down dog as a transition into the yoga segment.

The yoga portion of the practice begins with sun salutations:  Tom leads 3 repetitions of sun sal A and two rounds of sun sal B, emphasizing smoothing out the breath the entire time.  He then moves into a standing series consisting of triangle, warrior 2, and extended side stretch, alternating sides for each posture.  He completes the standing work with a wide leg forward bend (adding a shoulder stretch) and prayer twist (shown on the DVD cover).  Next, he transitions to seated for head to knee pose (starting with a bended knee to keep the back straight, which was helpful), attempting a brief arm balance before going to the other side.  After this is a half spinal twist, with Tom showing progressively more challenging options.  Moving to supine, he performs bridge, offering the option of repeating this easy backbend or trying upward bow.  He then stretches out the lower body with thread the needle and a seated side bend before moving into savasana, where he offers total silence for about 3 minutes.

I clocked the total time for the practice at about 46.5 minutes, which was evenly split between the Pilates and yoga portions (ie, approximately 23 minutes each).  Occasionally throughout the workout, insets appear at the top of the screen showing modifications of the current movement.  During the Pilates segment, Tom transitions rather quickly between the exercises, and since he provides little instructional information, prior familiarity with Pilates is definitely needed.  However, Tom does offer preps for some of the exericses--eg, a seated cross-leg twist before moving into saw and prepatory balance work before doing the full open leg rocker.  The yoga section flows at a more measured pace, but again, Tom gives almost no cueing on form, so prior knowledge of basic yoga postures is essential.

Overall, this is a nice practice for advanced beginner to intermediate practitioners who enjoy both Pilates and yoga and are interested in combining the two into a single session.",1167264000,13,3239,5.090909090909091
8006598,1,B00015401Y,"Sorry to be so frank but this DVD sucks!  I'm glad that I didn't spend my own money on this, but used a gift certificate.  The movements between poses is so quick that I had a difficult time keeping up.  Tom didn't allow you to stay in a pose long enough to achieve any benefit from it or enjoy it.  His monotone directions make this DVD even more boring than it already is.  I can't wait to receive my Jonathon Urla DVD's because this one is getting pitched.",1161648000,6,459,4.170454545454546
8006599,5,B00015401Y,"""Combining Pilates & Yoga for Balance is one of the few things I have been able to incorporate in my busy life to help stretch out and sooth my mind from the busy and stressful days of caring for my young children. The moves and poses are great for my back and hamstrings and Tom's way of presenting them is both soothing to the mind and effective in getting out the kinks in my overly tight muscles. I highly recommend it to not only Mom's but, anyone who desires longevity and health of mind and body.",1158105600,4,503,4.25
8006600,3,B00015401Y,"First I whole heartedly agree with this post: Not for beginners, June 20, 2005  Reviewer: MM ""yoga-fitness-gal"".  I would also like to add that the poses and transition between poses can be really quick and could cause injury (especially if you are not well warmed and stretched before starting the tape).  Also, in the beginning he promises modified poses and there were very few modifications in the 40 minutes of tape (and there really needed to be).

Now, that said, I should qualify my comments by saying I have not been doing yoga for decades like some of these folks.  I have taken a class on the weekend from the Y for a couple years (that is very gentle) and I do have a series of yoga tapes - one of which is a Rodney Yee tape (who is fairly strenuous).  So I guess I am a beginner/intermediate.

Two final notes.  There is no music on the tape.  That may mean nothing to some, but I like a little mood music.  Finally, the outtakes at the end will work your abs.  Sometimes I watch it for a little laugh therapy!",1156982400,6,1023,4.331578947368421
