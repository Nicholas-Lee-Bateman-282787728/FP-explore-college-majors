7994781,2,B0000A02X9,I watched it.  It seemed like broad comedy.  Perhaps if I was European nay Polish it would be more meaningful for me.  I don't recommend it.  It was a tiresome film.  Note:  I do like foreign films and don't mind subtitles so that's not the problem.,1477526400,,249,4.304347826086956
7994782,5,B0000A02X9,It's an excellent film.  Polanski is excellent and extremely funny.  I enjoyed it very much although I am very glad that there were English subtitles as the Polish is very old-fashioned.,1176163200,2,186,4.967741935483871
7994783,3,B0000A02X9,"Andrzej Wajda's film of popular Polish theatrical warhorse Zemsta is often broader than you might expect, not least because of a horrendously over the top and very theatrical performance by Roman Polanski as Papkin, the cowardly lovestruck braggart caught in the middle of a feud between two neighbors who share a Polish castle and are constantly plotting against each other, much to the chagrin of their infatuated children. The theatricality is quite deliberate: despite the location photography (another snow-covered castle, making it an ideal companion-piece in many ways for Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers on a double-bill), it's very much a piece of filmed theatre complete with asides to the audience and a final curtain call. Unfortunately, while never quite disastrous and despite having a few mildly amusing moments, it's also never quite successful, leaving you with a curiously unsatisfying experience that the poor translation on the DVD does little to help. Still, kudos to Rafal Krolikowski on a superb performance as the Notary's son that manages to straddle the theatrical and the cinematic with an ease the film itself never quite manages.",1171152000,2,1166,5.377049180327869
7994784,4,B0000A02X9,"I have no knowledge of Polish and had never seen the play this movie is based on. Yet, this movie is one of those stunning theatrical pieces that only foreign movies can be.

Very good direction, the movie is flawless in its flow, scenes move easily, the storyline is good and the humour, even though I don't know Polish, was well understood! Well, at least I laughed!

The acting is very good, Polanski as Papkin plays his part very well. This movie is very recommended if you like the odd surprise of a foreign movie that provides excellent drama and a fresh look.",1125446400,17,566,4.485436893203883
7994785,5,B0000A02X9,"Even after fifty odd years of mostly first-class film making, Andrzej Wajda doesn't cede to surprise and enchant. Lately he has given a nice turn to classical Polish Lit of the 18. and 19. centuries...After a costumed period-piece based on the main Polish epic, ""Pan Tadeusz"" (Adam Mickewicz) -pan Wajda tackled this delightful 1834 farce written by Aleksander Fredro. Story per se is rather thin and of second import.. a property feud between two noblemen unlucky enough to share the same castle! Sounds boring?

Not one bit.

Watch for Roman Polanski in the role of Papkin - a bungling small-time Baron Munchausen -never knew that Polanski is still so much on top of his native tongue (and culture I dare say).

There was some, mostly Polish gripes against the casting of the stunnigly beautiful Agata Buzek in the role of Klara. Perhaps the reason was a tad bit of envy. Agata's father was, betwixt 1997 an 2001, no less than the prime minister of Poland. Nontheless she makes a fine impression.

The only big-time complaint against this DVD is the lack of any translator's effort. It must have been challenging enough to memorize and act out the entire film in the 19. century Polish rhymed verse. So, the film, the cast, the director and Polish culture itself, have deserved a finer, more creative if not accurate translation. This way a casual viewer froma foreign country, just by following the subtitles, misses the point as the considerably witty and humorous dialogue gets totally voided.

The thing that delighted in ""Zemsta"", was also the sense that

all the playful thespians, including Polanski, , had had a terrific rapport and had greatly enjoyed helping Wayda make this sexy romp of a flick.",1125360000,15,1711,4.879310344827586
7994786,3,B0000A02X9,"'Zemsta' is one of the famous comedies in the history of the Polish theatre. Wajda did a good job in bringing Fredra's 19th century play to the silver screen.

The cast is made up of the greats Olbrzyski, Gajos and even Roman Polanski. The text is hillarious and witty however the English translations are not very good, occasionally whole phrases are left out or changed.",1104105600,5,372,4.723076923076923
