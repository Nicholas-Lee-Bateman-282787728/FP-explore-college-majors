8547913,5,B00A7ID80E,"Watched the film at Belcourt Theatre. Story is well told by the director. Vendors of The Contributor offer poignant views on poverty. This film gives the homeless a face in Nashville. There are stereotypes of homelessness. The director of this film, as well as the organizers and volunteers of The Contributer, do an excellent job of questioning those stereotypes. My favorite part of the documentary: the generosity and humanity of the city of Nashville.",1353456000,2,455,5.162162162162162
8547914,5,B00A7ID80E,"Christopher Roberts follows a handful of people finding success in an unusual place: Aspiring writers, disabled veterans, and young lovers struggle with homelessness on the streets of Music City, USA. Street Paper introduces us to a fresh enterprise with a unique mission: providing Diverse Perspectives on Homelessness and A Genuine Opportunity for Advancement. This is not a gritty expose of life on the streets or sentimental propaganda for their cause but a captivating snapshot of how the poor survive and how some people have found a special way to help.

I really liked the way this director made an exciting movie without glossing over awkward moments or over-dramatizing already dramatic situations. There is some kissing, some crying, and some laughs, but even that is presented in context. He gains private access to the paper and the vendors, shares their stories with dignity and respect, and creates a movie that is both entertaining and informative.

Thumbs up for the music too.",1353369600,2,994,5.20625
