7846372,5,630340491X,"Absolutely incredible movie.

This is a really fresh new approach to film making.  All of the critics acclaim, Deadly Past is incredibly seductive.  Plus, some have openly even said ""This, may very well be one of the best films of the year.""

Moving and seductive while bringing action to a haulting appreciation of film making.  Incredible director and producer team who duo for a great flick.  Suggestively one of the newest screen gems for unsung heroe's.  Kick you're night up a couple notches, watch Deadly Past as it's to die for!

5 Stars, hands down.",1152403200,,558,4.8
