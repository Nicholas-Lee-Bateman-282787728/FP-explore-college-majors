6870849,5,B00QJ6RRGY,"Excellent movie.  There was a minor editing gaffe at the start that concerned me but patience paid off.  I was pleased the writers deviated from the standard Hollywood story arc and requisite tidy conclusion.  The atmosphere is enjoyably disquieting and the finale unpredictable.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who has enjoyed films such as Cache or La Moustache.  If you're hoping for a big reveal, a twist, or an ""a-ha!"" moment to scratch those mental itches, you'll be disappointed.  There is a twist, of sorts, but it begins very early and never completely unwinds.  In a way, the movie IS the twist.",1424563200,3,609,4.854368932038835
6870850,5,B00QJ6RRGY,"Thought this movie was extremely refreshing in an era when it seems like every filmmaker is just trying to rip off the last successful movie that came out.

Guess what?  Not everything you see in a movie is supposed to make sense right away.  It is a form of art, and you can tell that the cast and crew that worked on this film appreciate that.

Ultimately, this movie provokes an emotional response the way few films do these days.",1423699200,2,433,4.375
6870851,4,B00QJ6RRGY,"Ok, this is a really interesting movie. I didn't like it. But then I did. Then I was perplexed. Next I was intrigued. Finally, I was confused. Not about the story, I get it, to a degree at least. I was still confused about whether or not I enjoyed it. I watched it again. Now I was more struck by how visually appealing it was and how tense even the everyday encounter was. So yeah, I did like it. The acting was good, but a little off at times. And I do have to admit that it felt a little pretentious on occasion. But yeah, I really liked it. This is one of those arty genre pieces that people either love or hate. A little amateurish, but impressive nonetheless. Id like to see what this guy could do with more money at his disposal.",1418774400,12,736,4.118055555555555

I love films that defy classification and make you think.  There are many out there, however they seem denied major publicity unless a big name like David Lynch or Tim Burton is attached.  Revolver Entertainment has released an epic film that fits into this category, titled HOUSE OF LAST THINGS.  This film is a visual masterpiece that is as haunting as its imagery.  I would wager this is a film that will be talked about for a long time.

Director Michael Bartlett is a truly visionary filmmaker, and I will be putting his name on my list of  Directors to Watch For.  He has accomplished a huge feat here by releasing a visually stimulating film rife with symbolism and interpretation.  And yet it is a gripping thriller/mystery at the same time.  This Kubrick-esque jaunt into surreal territory is a real treat.

HOUSE OF LAST THINGS is shot beautifully and contains a slew of artistic cinematography.  But the portrait it helps paint is a vivid and haunting tapestry that portrays a story of love and loss.  The artistic elements intertwined with the thrilling storyline make this movie cinematic gold.

The acting is superb with the entire cast doing an excellent job in their roles.  I found no lacking performances, and I credit each cast member with bringing their characters to larger-than-life status.  This is yet one more feather in the cap of the production team.

The plot of HOUSE OF LAST THINGS is what really wins here, though.  It keeps you guessing, right up until the big reveal at the end, and then gives a satisfying climax with a nice dose of resolution to close the film out.  I will admit I was confused early on, but I quickly caught up and finished the film very happy.

HOUSE OF LAST THINGS is a major win for me.  Part mystery, part drama, and part thriller, this hybrid of a film will entertain on many levels.  Give it a look for sure.  It is available now in a variety of formats.",1426809600,,1987,4.56657223796034
6870866,2,B00QJ6RRGY,I gave this movie an honest shot based on some of the reviews but somewhere along the line I lost interest and never finished it. I could not deal with a ranch house in Portland that had a curse or something. Better to watch Grimm if you want Portland.,1426723200,,252,4.163265306122449
6870867,5,B00QJ6RRGY,"Im going to give House of Last Things one of the highest compliments I can give a movie.  Are you ready?

Here it is:  House of Last Things is like the adult version of Are You Afraid of the Dark that I have always wanted.

If you don't know what Are You Afraid of the Dark is, thats a shame.  But Im here to help!  Dark was a Nickelodeon show that aired in the 90s.  The simplest synopsis?  Scary stories for kids.  But it went way beyond that.  Over the years, Ive gone back and watched episodes.  The conclusion?  Dark is a legitimate example of powerful short narrative structure.  There is simple conflict.  Strong themes.  Symbolism.  Resolution.  Almost always an up-ending, but episodes here and there don't always conclude with the happiest results.

The show has 7,323 ratings on IMDB.  Its overall rating?  8.4.  EIGHT POINT FOUR.  On Amazon, the season one DVD has an overall rating of 4.6 out of 5.

I know, I know.  We cant trust ratings.  Argo has a high rating and I think Argo is an awful movie.  But what Im trying to say is that Are You Afraid of the Dark is not some rinky-dink kids show that people laugh at and Im shamelessly praising.  It was awesome and if you search the internet you will find many testimonials of people saying the show continues to holds up.

As a huge fan of Dark, imagine my joy as I watched House of Last Things.

The key similarity is the psychological terror.  Dark being a kids show could never really venture into the realm of horror, so it had to crank up the creep-factor.  It did so by having surreal things happen that were an extension of a characters psychology.  For instance, in one episode a kid wants to prove that the stuffed clown in his towns funhouse isn't haunted.  So he steals the clowns nose.  What happens next?  The clown, of course, begins to haunt the kid, going full-on stalker mode.  It follows him, at first from a distance.  But getting closer.  And closer.  Until the kid has the sense to return the nose.  In another episode, a girl wonders if shes pretty.  So the plot revolves around a woman trying to steal the girls face.  Im going to repeat that.

The plot revolves around a woman trying to steal a girls face.

The terror of the show is a byproduct of real, every day fears.  A kid wants to prove spirits don't exist, so of course a spirit haunts the kid.  A girl wonders if shes pretty, starts to think she is, then someone tries to steal her face.

House of Last Things operates in a similar manner but with more complexity.  There are two couples, a married couple and a pair of twenty-somethings.  The husband and wife seem happy and supportive of one another.  While the twenty-somethings have conversations that conclude with a blow-up fight or what seems like great sex.  We can make the assumption that the fear of a loving couple is losing their love.  And the fear of a passionate couple is losing their passion.  So what do you think happens in the movie?

What impresses me most about House of Last Things is how deep it goes.  Not only does each couple face their fears, the individual characters have multiple fears.  Using the same methods of Are You Afraid of the Dark, Writer/director Michael Bartlett finds a way to make each fear concrete.  How so?  The supernatural.  So terror and horror elements come into play.  A yellow balloon appearing over and over again.  A bath tub full of blood.  A mirror that shows visions of what no one wants to see.  There is a sense of threat that permeates that movie, but it isn't a threat of physical violence so much as it is the threat of total psychological annihilation.

What is heartbreaking about the film is that there is no recourse.  What we are watching is a demise.  The power of the past rising up to throttle all potential futures so that what was continues to be.  Due to this process, each of the characters undergoes a transformation, a change in charge that is a slow burn rather than a sudden and climactic shift.  What each character cares about veers in a new direction.  Inflections change.  Habits break and emerge.  Calm shatters, volatility cools.  Even though there are survivors in the story, the survivors are not who they were.  The gap between how things are at the start of the movie and how things are at the end is immense.  Kudos to everyone involved.

There is a lot to think about in this movie.  As symbolic as Mulholland Drive, as creepy and psychologically grounded as the best Are you Afraid of the Dark.  House of Last Things will enthrall you or be too much to handle.  Pretty impressive either way.",1426636800,3,4582,4.473876063183475

6870869,1,B00QJ6RRGY,"Don't waste your time or money..the movie is horrid. The actors are terrible, the plot stinks, and I am so sorry I listened to the other feedback because they mostly gave it 4/5 stars. But seriously, they must have been watching a different movie or was stoned when they wrote the feedback. Because even if it was free, I still would have given it thumbs down.

8691471,5,B00QJ6RRGY,"This was an excellent spooky movie. The plot pulls you along with a sense of growing creepiness as the main characters move along their character arc. The acting and production are top-quality, much better than I expected from a low-budget thriller. And the effective use of classical music pieces adds to the overall atmosphere of ""the house,"" especially toward the end. it's certainly refreshing to watch a thriller that uses character, dialog and atmosphere to thrill rather than spurting blood and jump cuts. I hear that the creative people behind this movie are planning to make another. I'm eager to see it.",1489881600,,613,5.019607843137255
8691472,2,B00QJ6RRGY,"I'm all for surrealism and symbolism as an art form but this movie, while aspiring to those standards, fails miserably on all attempts to get there. There are interesting metaphors which (in more capable hands) could have made a good story. But here, the result is disjointed, inconsistent, boring and rather painful to watch.

The characters are one dimensional and lack depth. You don't really connect with them. Moreover, the acting is terrible, the suspense is flat, the supposed creepiness is singularly annoying and, to underscore it all, the pretentiousness of this movie becomes its undoing. You just want to fast forward this mess of a movie to the end.",1459555200,,662,5.0181818181818185

8691476,5,B00QJ6RRGY,"This wonderful film is similar to  Alfred Hitchcock  films  With 3 Emmy Award winning actors!!!  You need to pay attention and have an open mind on the subject of the after life.
The wife, Sarah, played by Diane Louise Dalton, was  extremely intense. She helped us figure out the puzzle of the film through words, mannerisms and through every flicker in those sad, but beautiful Green eyes. You feel here pain and want to learn more of the reason for the pain and sadness.  Do not forget that name, Diane Louise Dalton!!!",1434585600,,521,4.608695652173913

It is engaging, it makes you pay attention, it grabs you back into it when you think it's slow, it's truly entertaining in its visual/cinematic qualities, the acting/directing is overall very high quality. The characters you liked in the beginning you hate at the end, and vice versa. The music is great! Diane Dalton is powerful as Sarah, and the scene in the end wraps this up and yanks at your heart for her. The plot unwinds, and in the end you're left with your jaw dropping, as in the movie, The 6th Sense. I had to watch it twice, and it left me with visual flashbacks for days.  A high quality cult thriller to be remembered!",1432771200,,677,4.373015873015873
