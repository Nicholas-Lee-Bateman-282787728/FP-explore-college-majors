7942503,5,B00005JXYI,...for the bit of sadist in us all.  Nick Mancuso gives a devilishly delightful and captivating performance!  A well-executed storyline and good dialogue makes this a movie I enjoyed as much now as I did the only other time I saw it some twenty-one years ago...it is that memorable.,1486944000,,282,4.73469387755102

7942509,5,B00005JXYI,"A truly beautiful film about the Divine Marquis - the presentation begins with erotic nude paintings which transform into beautiful women of like-kind in the same poses, all ready for ravishment - the supple flesh ready for the picking - erect nipples, rosy blushing flesh, creamy sensuous skin - such delectable carnality...

 The Marquis follows his passionate bliss; worlds of salacious rapport proceeds from his limitless daemonic imagination, words as flaming embers igniting the Hellfires of Lust in all who read his works - even those who claim to despise him deny their own true humanimal natures on the surface, but cannot deny their eager impulses in the shadows of their minds.

 The plot revolves around ""Justine"", a comely young lady in search of her younger sister, rumored to have come in the clutches of De Sade, who did thus fashion her into his perfect creation - a Lady ""corrupted"" {enlightened} with insatiable pulchritude; educated in the delights of the flesh within a den of sublime iniquity, to learn first-hand the in-depth being of a character she sought to pretentiously portray in her role of actress turned sex-slave.

 De Sade is wed, and flaunts his libidinous activities before his wife and step-mother - the question remains however, why did he not take them both as well? In a particularly moving scene, even his wife, whom he seems to ignore for the most part, is not devoid of his debaucheries, when upon complaining of his joyful licentiousness, is taken, by the Marquis' command, by the man-servants on the dinner table as his echoes resound throughout the house, even unto the ears of her mother. Also of note, he decides to take the chambre-maid over the grand piano into realms of ecstasy.

 De Sade had devised a deliciously wicked method of sado-masochistic indulgence, and necessitated a fresh damsel upon which to apply it, to her ultimate pleasure, and so he found Justine's sister.

 Justine visits De Sade daily in his jail cell {thusly accused of his various excesses, unfortunately, also including murder}, where he awaits execution by the guillotine; but in a gallant scene, is helped by her to escape, wherein the executioner is ironically himself executed, The French Revolution is inspired, and they steal away in an awaiting cortege' to his chteau to meet with Justine's sister, as he promised had he lived, and finds quite a surprise upon arrival. Hooded phantoms hide dark secrets.

 I enjoyed this version just a bit better than Quills, mainly because of the aristocratic aesthetics, the artful environments, and the etiquette of the characters.

 In the end, the emotion which De Sade claimed was an illusion was indeed mutually experienced by he and Justine, yet he could not abandon his masterpiece awaiting him in chains, and remained ""the master of his own disappointment"".",1113436800,3,2836,5.032051282051282
7942510,1,B00005JXYI,"Im fed up! I can't rely on the movie industry to put out a reasonable, (purely)fact-based representation of the Marquis' life! I actually had high hopes for this movie bacause it was said to be based on the true story. SORRY! TRY AGAIN! I was apalled! Bad acting, bad directing, horrible story line, and low budget. Thats not even all of it. When are the creators of movies going to realize that enough happened in his life that its not even nessesary to make things up? Theres no way in [heck] that the things that happen in this movie could have happened, so why proclaim it ""based on a true story""? It's clear to me this is not so, and that he is merely a character in a line of events (so distorted and rearanged!) based on a loose description of De Sades' life (with some conveinient changes).I'm sorry, but I thought this movie was atrocious, and I once again wait to see a biographical movie worthy to carry his name.",1018915200,8,924,4.409356725146199
7942511,2,B00005JXYI,"Althought I like Nick Mancuso and usually movies about the Marquis De Sade, I didn't like this one. Good cast/not so good plot. I bought it/then viewed it. Would not recommend the same. Lisa C,",1003795200,5,193,4.542857142857143
