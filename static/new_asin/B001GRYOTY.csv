3619083,5,B001GRYOTY,Quality additional to amazon prime!,1486166400,,35,6.2
3619084,5,B001GRYOTY,"A good, solid historical drama with a talented European cast. The plot's based on what is known of the life of Nostradamus, including the incontrovertible predictions he made that came true during his lifetime. The film also makes guesses as to what else Nostradamus saw in his visions, which might make some people uncomfortable. But it is possible to enjoy this look at an era without necessarily believing in prognostication. As usual, Rutger Hauer steals the show, dropping by as a mad monk who only accidentally fails to set the place on fire.",1486166400,,548,4.903225806451613
3619085,4,B001GRYOTY,"Most of us know about him as someone who could predict the future. But I enjoyed this movie because of the history, and because of his own personal story as a healer and an educator. it was very well done with a superb cast. Anyone who loves historical fiction or movies ""based on..."" historical events will enjoy it.",1485129600,,317,4.482758620689655

3619100,2,B001GRYOTY,It was not well done. The settings were hokey at best and the acting not much better. I think Nostrdamus was smoking some bad weed that brought on the hallucinations.,1477440000,,166,4.566666666666666

3619104,2,B001GRYOTY,"Very plain stereotypical characters. Priests, doctors, etc. Typical visions of the collapsing modern city. The movie has no individuality. Besides, no one really knows what Nostradamus predicted. All his messages are encrypted and hard to understand. So we can easily see what we wanna see.",1476576000,,290,5.466666666666667

3619121,4,B001GRYOTY,"Very good movie, I've been meaning to watch it, and finally found the time. I love science, so it interesting to me, there's a lot of history about Nostradamus, this just scratched the surface.",1475539200,,193,4.705882352941177

The movie takes a lot of mystery away and humanized the man.",1475539200,,105,4.25
3619124,3,B001GRYOTY,Somewhat informative,1475539200,,20,9.5

3619127,1,B001GRYOTY,I was sadly disappointed in this movie. I think we really didn't need to know how he had his children. Seemed to me more like a rated XXX movie. Totally inappropriate.,1475452800,,167,4.419354838709677
3619128,5,B001GRYOTY,"Great movie for any mystic, it seems a little dated but if you can get past that its awesome and portrays the reality of the inquisition that we so often don't actually learn about",1475452800,,180,4.323529411764706

3619131,5,B001GRYOTY,"Watching this epic truth of Nostradamus was almost as good as reading the books about him, yet gave me a great detail more in which I had imagined how he came to predict the future so far in advance. I really enjoyed the Movie from the beginning until the end.   Will introduce this movie to my friends who feel the same way.",1475366400,,325,4.225806451612903
3619132,1,B001GRYOTY,"I like the version of Nostradamus narrated by Orson Welles a lot better! It has tons of  his predictions, excitement, great action and denotes many that have come true as well as some that are happening NOW and some in the Furture! It's a great movie, and I first saw it back in about 1980. The title is ""The Man Who Saw Tomorrow"" produced by Warner Brothers Studios.",1475193600,,367,4.397058823529412

3619136,4,B001GRYOTY,I greatly enjoyed this movie and the way the 1400 to 1500 were represented. What a very difficult life for intelligent women of the period.,1474934400,,139,4.6

3619140,5,B001GRYOTY,"The best film ever about the enigmatic Nostradamus.  A period drama, heart-wrenchingly moving, beautifully filmed and cast, with Tcheky Karyo so believable in the leading role.

3619160,5,B001GRYOTY,"Any movie that prompts me to go out and read as much as I can on any subject matter is a 5 star movie in my book. Nostradamus is very well done, and the acting is superb, but more than that it left me wanting to know more.",1474588800,,222,3.6458333333333335
3619161,2,B001GRYOTY,Seemed pretty good for a while and then the director threw in fairly graphic sex and nudity that did not need to be there. That's when we switched to another movie.,1474502400,,164,4.32258064516129

3619171,5,B001GRYOTY,"This is an awesome dramatization of the life of Nostradamus. Everything was done beautifully, with top of the line acting, photography and production. I loved the interpretation of how Nostradamus would have been as a person and how he would react to the people and world around him. This is not very easy to do with the life of someone as well known and controversial as Nostradamus. I found myself totally engrossed and involved with this movie and highly recommend it to everyone, whether you believe he was a mystic seer or not.",1474416000,,532,4.731182795698925

3619195,5,B001GRYOTY,Brilliant portrayal of Nostradamus by Tcheky Karyo.  It was a very clear depiction of what life was like during the Middle Ages.  Mr. Karyo lends a human touch to a man we only know as a seer but this film brings out his tenderness and caring as a human being living through perilous times.  He was a notable man of learning who made significant contributions to the betterment of society as a whole.  I recommend this film very highly.  I would classify it as an historical. futuristic and romantic drama.,1474243200,,506,4.5777777777777775

3619268,5,B001GRYOTY,"I really enjoyed this film. The acting was superb and the amazing turbulent life of Nostradamus opened my eyes once again to the immense struggle of forward thinking genius individuals who went up against the close-minded rulers of the Catholic Church at that time.  The position the Church, as well as society, held of women no matter how brilliant, served as a reminder of how far we've come in the fight for equality of the sexes.  Nostradamus was selfless and compassionate, healing the sick during the horrors of the Plague, putting his own life at risk, and tortured by his increasingly prophetic visions of the future, many of which went unheeded. They drove him close to madness, and Tcheky Karyo portrayed him passionately.
I recommend Nostradamus highly to anyone who wants to be transported in time to a very real glimpse of the deplorable plague and the relentless human spirit of this man whose name and life will always remain mysterious, yet mystical.",1473552000,,966,4.920245398773006

Some liberties are taken when Nostradamus has visions of the future including Hitler, the atomic bomb, JFK, Saddam Hussein, and human colonists to new planets.

3619332,4,B001GRYOTY,"Working from the sketchy historical details that are known about him, and taking a certain amount of dramatic license, the film ""Nostradamus"" chronicles the life of Michel de Nostredame (Tcheky Karyo), who came to be known more for his prophecies than for his work as a physician and an apothecary toiling against the ravages of plague-decimated 16th Century Europe.

Nostradamus was born into a Jewish family that converted to Christianity in order to escape the religious persecution of the Inquisition.  Even as a small child, he was tormented by visions of events surrounding the fate of loved ones and of doomed cities in the future being torn asunder.  As a young adult in medical school, he railed against the primitive practices which incorporated 'bleeding' into any treatment course.  More than 30 years before the first rudimentary microscopes built by Zacharias Jansenn and Anton van Leeuwenhoek and the discovery of bacteria, Nostradamus had the foresight to burn infected clothing and to wash his hands before and after patient contact.  He argued for better hygiene and nutrition as a deterrent to illness, as well as discovering a ""rose pill"" which aided in the treatment of early-stage plague victims.  For these activities, he was brought before the Grand Inquisitor on more than one occasion for practicing the black arts.

With the assistance of his mentor, Dr. Scalinger (F. Murray Abraham), Nostradamus struggled to decipher his overpowering visions with the use of astrology and books on mysticism outlawed by the Catholic Church.  Nostradamus would later serve as an advisor to Catherine de' Medici after predicting the death of her husband, King Henry II of France.  In his declining years, saddled with gout, Nostradamus would sit, night after night, sleep deprived and driven to feverishly write down his prophetic quatrains.  He foresaw events far into the future--one of which many would come to interpret as the rise of Hitler and World War II.

Michel Nostradamus is represented in the film as a fallible man--driven as much by base passion as loftier emotions.  Often in biopics the person is represented as too saintly or too villainous.  Here, Nostradamus is just a decent man struggling with the everyday problems and issues of his time.  The superb supporting cast includes Rutger Hauer (The Mystic Monk), Amanda Plummer (Catherine de' Medici),  Anthony Higgins (King Henry II) and Michael Gough (Jean de Remy).  The cinematography is simply lush and each frame looks like it could have been lifted from a Renaissance painting.

If I have any complaint about the film (and it's a small one), it is that Nostradamus' life was so full and rich that the nearly 2 hour running time doesn't do it justice.  Sometimes it felt like you were getting a rushed, ""just the highlights"" version of an amazing life.

Whether or not you assign merit to his prognostications, Nostradamus remains a fascinating historical figure who lived in a tumultuous and perilous era.  He improved the lives of those around him at great personal risk to himself.  A thoroughly enjoyable and fascinating biopic.  It should be noted that this is an adults only film.  There is nudity and explicit sexual behavior throughout.",1158278400,,3229,5.1085714285714285
3619333,5,B001GRYOTY,"The movie is excellent; however, many of the previously written reviews are disappointing.  The writer of the script and director of the movie did a wonderful job of giving us not only a historical context for this enigma of a man but also an idea of what his personal life must have been like.  I don't know what some critcs expect, considering all information on the personal life of Nostradamus is sketchy at best, but bringing him to life in this movie was extremely entertaining and informative if one knows how to ""read between the lines"" in a historical drama.  Furthermore, as to the expectation of Nostradamus ""doing something"" with his visions, I would recommend a rigorous study of European history during the centuries of the Holy Inquisition.  Anyone ""seeing things"" most certainly needed to keep his mouth shut!  Nostradamus demonstrated great courage writing about his visions at all, hence, the complicated structure.  I would very much like to see this movie on DVD; I would buy it immediately!",1152835200,,1011,4.952662721893491
3619334,5,B001GRYOTY,"Gee, it seems all reviews up to this date I write have COMPLETELY MISSED the ""obvious"", and that being~
Tcheky Karyo's ""Michel"" is not only a ""hipster-saint"" mystic of those dreadful Dark Ages( but are not we are currently in a NEW DARK AGES ,""imo""...), but the ladies just can not seem to get their hands OFF our bearded stalwart ""Nosti"", no he is ONE HOT ITEM !
(And WHAT a cast of ladies, Julie Armond, Assumpta Serna, Maja Morgenstern,gee , even Amanda Plummer as ""the Queenie"" is as interesting as the other 3 mentioned are lovely).They all ""dig"" our boy , they were the original ""groupies"".
  My mind was continually distracted from a quite enjoyable ""historical fiction"" account of the life of this legendary and enigmatic ""prognosticator""~~he was NOT a ""procrastinator"" when it came to a bit of ""back to the castle bedroom for some bouncy-bouncy"". Would this ""Movie Nosti"" turn down a trip to the sack??(is there an alligator that would refuse the corpse???) Grrrr,""have at it"", Michel !!
Our beloved (and overly medicated)""Don Juan"" de Nostradame even had second thoughts when he gets a proposal from one of his aging female patients *whilst*(isnt that how they said that word then, hehe!)his hand was checking in vicinity of  her mammalian apparatus for swollen lymph nodes from  PLAGUE!
Excellent performances by all, great ""period-piece "" costumes, ""medieval"" soundtrack and empassioned performances, even if a bit OVER THE TOP.
A thouroughly delightful movie not meant to reveal any ""truths"", but should spur interest to discover the ""historical"" Nostradamus and just sit back and enjoy this emminently watchable film....",1038614400,,1634,5.085820895522388
3619335,5,B001GRYOTY,This is one of the best movies I have seen on him.  It was highly enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone wanting to add to their Nostradamus collection. This is one not to pass up.,1036972800,,180,4.0
3619336,4,B001GRYOTY,"Not a bad movie , especially for those who find the history channel too dry. It weaves the base truth of his life and loves into a palatable mix of history and dramatization.",1035504000,,174,4.303030303030303
3619337,2,B001GRYOTY,"The prophecies of the 16th century seer Nostradamus have tantalized his supporters for centuries.  Those who believe in him tout his accurate predictions.  Those who doubt him point to the vagueness of those predictions that can be interpreted in more than one way.  Director Roger Christian is unclear whether he wanted to present a documentary of the life of Nostradamus or a traditional film with plot, theme, and characterization.  What the viewer gets in NOSTRADAMUS is some unsatisfactory hybrid that bounces from scene to scene with little to tie them together.  Tcheky Karyo plays the lead as one who is only too well aware of the mystical nature of a prophet who sees visions of far flung events.  Every five minutes or so, Nostradamus looks into a small pot of water that mysteriously bubbles and forms visions that look suspiciously like film clips of nuclear blasts, the Kennedy assassination, Nazis marching, and a wickedly smiling Saddam Hussein.  Now I have no problem with the film's premise that one man could have preternatural powers of divination, but if I see a vision that I know is historical fact, then I expect the director to do more with that vision than merely use it to drum up charges by the Holy Inquisition about heresy.  Unfortunately, with each passing vision, there is no accompanying reverberation and the film stops dead in its tracks.  After three or four visions, I wanted to grab Nostradamus and shout: 'Do something with this vision!' F. Murray Abraham at least adds some emotional pop with his warnings to Nostradamus not to publicize his visions. The other supporting characters have little to do but react predictably to these visions.  By the end, all I could take away was the limited knowledge that some guy in history saw weird things but did not use this weirdness in any meaningful way.  A movie is supposed to do more than that.",1030320000,,1879,4.858934169278997
3619338,5,B001GRYOTY,"I don't even know who Nostradamus was, until I rented this movie about 5 years ago, and wow! Even though this movie probably doesnt convey an accurate prediction of the future (many other movies, documentaries have different opinion of course). But it did make a point what life is like in the middle-age europe, what nostradamus really is. So this movie is basically a docu-drama and it is a definitely a cult classic if I could ever find that movie anywhere in blockbuster video",974246400,,480,4.726190476190476
3619339,2,B001GRYOTY,"This dull biopic treats the life of Michel de Nostradamus so superficially that each event is only dressing for the visions that are his claim to fame. Unfortunately, director Roger Christian presents these in such a pop way that by the time Michel is painting a swastika on the wall, the audience is laughing. Perhaps there is no way to present the prophecies visually without failing. It's hard not to view Nostradamus as a know-it-all since we have the benefit of hindsight, but that doesn't explain his efforts to alter what he sees in the world, which you would think is pointless. The cast is a mire of accents, although some of the actors do make an impression. This is possibly the best film opportunity Amanda Plummer had up to the 1995 release year of the film, since Daniel in 1983, and as Catherine de Medici she does well. Maja Morgenstein brings a Maria Callas mystery and passion to her role as Helene, and F Murray Abraham seems to have fun as Scalinger. Tcheky Karyo, who resembles the young George Segal, plays Nostro as a passive Christ, when what is needed is the demonism Rutger Hauer brings to his cameo.",969667200,,1126,4.635

Great period, drama with lovely costumes and sets.  I'm always amazed at how much influence the church had on people's lives. This movie gives us a good look at different beliefs and how the people reacted to them.

The acting was great and the characters were nicely developed.  At the end of the movie you will hear lots of familiar names. I enjoyed thinking back to my history lessons and remembering which royal died where and why.  Too bad some of them didn't read the predictions and try to figure out if they could use the information to make changes.",1512259200,,692,4.417322834645669

Maybe not, but there was so much to his life.  He was passionate about medicine, the human condition and many things.  What a gift he was to all of us.  And that gift caused he and his family much suffering.  Yet he persisted.  In the end, I found much peace in his prediction and hope for mankind and this world created by God.",1497312000,,501,4.336956521739131
