8267518,5,B0017VG5Y6,"I really love this series of Jupiter moon and I will order all the episodes in this series because it is really good. It is amazing how this is so good. This is a fun, though dated series. It is basically a soap dressed in SF clothing. Little to do with SF issues, which are used only as a stimulus (or backdrop) for the human interaction. The characters are, however, easy to get involved with. The acting is a bit stilted, which in many cases, saves the low budget project from being un-watchable.

I enjoyed it. One should start at the start and watch it in order, as with many soaps, one must keep up with the interplay of characters.",1367971200,,638,4.316666666666666
8267519,4,B0017VG5Y6,"The premise of Jupiter Moon is that the Jupiter system has been colonized. The first season, the Far Frontier, most of the story takes place on the Ilea, a former deep space exploration vessel now consigned to the Jupiter system. The Ilea's tenant is Columbus college, a university that houses 50 students with a faculty of five. Ship's crew make another five. There is also Space City on Calisto.

Jupiter Moon is an acquired taste like the original Dark Shadows. Both use a format that was developed for soap operas. Much of the fun is watching the vision of life in space and the various interaction of the characters. This is not a high action, special effects laden show. The show has a stage feel to it. It is about life at a university that is also on a frontier. Special effects are low budget, and the arcs are long. The colony is heavily European with British, French, and German people",1352592000,,896,4.565217391304348

8267521,1,B0017VG5Y6,"I ordered the 4 volumes of this series from 4 different vendors on the Amazon Marketplace. Every single one of them came sealed, but with broken cases and loose discs. I wrote to the customer service email at Image Entertainment - and the email bounced! I then called them, and they told me ""Tough Luck - go back to the merchants.""That might be reasonable if it had not been ALL FOUR SETS! I have done that anyway. I have gotten partial reimbursements from a couple of them. But that's not fair to them, or me. Look at the number of items that say ""sealed, but discs are loose"". Image Entertainment needs to be taken to task for these shoddy products, and their attitude. I own hundreds of discs from Image and even explained that to them. These are the only ones I have had a problem with. But you can bet from now on I will think twice before ever buying another one of their products!",1245801600,5,887,4.349397590361446
8267522,4,B0017VG5Y6,"When I first heard about Jupiter Moon, I thought that it would be similar to Star Trek quality, so I purchased it.  It was not.  I watched 10 minutes of it and put it away.  On another occasion, I asked my daughter if she wanted to see Jupiter Moon to compare the extreme lack of similarities between the two shows.  It turned out the second was the charm. It is by no means Star Trek quality but entertaining nonetheless and has a very campy feel to it.  We got hook.",1218585600,3,468,4.155555555555556
