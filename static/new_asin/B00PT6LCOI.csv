8689146,5,B00PT6LCOI,"Acting was amazing.  But it did not appear to be digitally remastered, and on the package it says, ""color,"" and it is definitely black & white!!  We did enjoy the movie.  Great to see such a young Humphrey Bogart.",1517788800,,213,4.410256410256411

8689148,2,B00PT6LCOI,"Wasn't his best. They featured more of the lesser known actors and Bogart was not really a main character. I was disappointed with the film because it was awfully slow. Bogart IS good in this, but his presence in the film was minimal. I felt ripped off personally and didn't really care for this one. The picture quality is only okay. Otherwise save your money to watch more of a solid presence of Bogart.",1471824000,2,405,4.486486486486487

8689150,4,B00PT6LCOI,"I'm a huge Bogart fan,  so this movie was a must.  The movie itself was amazing.  Truly a great bogart film; that being said the transfer wasn't the best.  The volume and picture wasn't quite as crisp as i would like.  But considering this is the only means to get this particular movie i would say it was worth it.",1463011200,4,315,4.183333333333334
