1520665,3,B00005JNNT,"If your are just in the mood to get a couple of scares and a little of the creeps, this is the movie to see.  Michael Keaton plays a somewhat overly happily married man that seems to have everything until his wife's car is found on the side of the road, and she is announced as missing.  He is then approached by a man (Ray) that says he has been contacted by her and that she is dead.  (She, in fact, does turn up dead three weeks after she goes missing.)  Keaton's character is relunctant, at first, to accept what this total stranger has to say.  However, after the death of Ray, he becomes OBSESSED with the whole EVP thing.  He becomes convinced that his wife is contacting him from the dead to help save some of the other citizens of the area where he lives.  Not to ruin anything, but as it turns out, this is not why she was contacting him.  The plot is suspenseful enough, but never really develops more than that.  After watching it, I was left asking myself several questions, wondering if I had missed something. (I was after all surrounded on one side by three drunk young men who thought it was hilarious when Unger's character did the ""Nestea Plunge"" from her fourth floor balcany, and four overly stupid and giggly teenage girls on the other who talked through the ENTIRE movie.  Not to mention the guy in front of me text messaging whomever throughout half the movie--my what a bright screen on that phone!  Love people like that, by the way, makes the movie-going experience a joy!!)  My biggest question would have to be:  ""If she knew that John's life was in danger, and was really trying to warm HIM--why did she make contact and draw him into this whole series of events in the first place?""  Like I said, good to see for fun, but don't try to make too much sense of it.",1105142400,3,1792,4.358433734939759
1520666,4,B00005JNNT,"White Noise is definetely a ""hell-raiser"" spook fest. It's more original and it serves some chilling sound effects and visuals. Michael Keaton gives a haunting and moving performance, and it's one of his best in recent years. He was able to portray all the fear and curiousity in his character. The story is intense and suspenseful from start to finish.

Michael Keaton is Jonathon, and his wife Anna died in a car accident and the body was found days later. It was suspected that she might have been murdered. Durinig his early grieving days, he was visited by EVP specialist named Raymond Price, and he was told that his deceased wife was trying to contact him. He ignored the man, and didn't take his advice. Eventually, he started to get phone messages that had his wife's voice. He went back to Price to seek his help to contact his wife. There, he meets Sarah(Deborah Kara Unger) who had been assisted to hear messages of his deceased fiance. Together they set out to find answers behind the noises and fuzzy pictures on the screen......

There are some really disturbing and frightening scenes in this movie. When Jonathan visited a blind psychic, he transmitted an image of a screaming ghost to her mind, and she was terrified. Another moment is when Jonathan was trying to talk to Anna on the TV screen, and an angry ghost suddenly appeared on the screen. It's very spooky when in the middle of nowhere unexpectedly, the evil ghosts jumps out. Also, it's ending is quite twisted. Keaton carried the entire film and appeared in almost everyscene. He was captivating when he was alone in the dark. Unger(Crash) was underused, but she had a few freaky moments to endured.",1105142400,,1677,4.739726027397261
1520667,3,B00005JNNT,"PLOT: After Jonathan's wife dies in a car crash, a man comes to Jonathan telling him that he can contact the spirit of his wife through EVP. (EVP is when images and sounds of the dead come through on electronic devices, such as on blank radio or TV stations.) Initially resistant to this, Jonathan finally hears some garbled messages from his wife, and decides to contact her further. He sets up a multi-TV/VCR/radio station in his apartment, and attempts to seek her. But the messages he receives include the image of three shady looking figures, and then he begins getting images on the TV of people not yet dead...

MY THOUGHTS: If you're looking for a movie to scare the daylights out of you, White Noise just might do the job. However, most of its scares relies on ""BOO!"" moments: BANG! A screaming face pops into the calmly fuzzing white noise on the TV. BOOM! A freight truck cuts in front of Jonathan's minivan.

While the scares are mostly effective, they get tiring after a while. The atmosphere of the movie is clean and bright instead of eerie and haunting, and when it's over, you're left with the feeling that you've suffered through ten or twelve heart attacks, but with no real spooky chills down your spine.

The plot is greatly flawed, suffering from a VERY slow and boring beginning and a rushed ending that fails to explain what exactly happened to the characters. Lots of aspects of the plot (the three shadowy figures, for instance) are left dangling. Also, certain aspects of the EVP images require a suspension of disbelief: Like, how do they appear on the screen? Who frames these shots? A ghost cameraman?

I gave this movie 3 stars because it does what it's required to do: to scare you, even though it did use cheap scares to do it. I docked 2 stars off due to the movie's inconsistent pacing, thin atmosphere, and unanswered questions at the end.",1105056000,19,1875,4.63855421686747
1520668,5,B00005JNNT,"For most of us, there is a morbid curiosity of what happens beyond.  In White Noise, Michael Keaton's character, a paranormal researcher, gets contacted by his deceased wife.  I've read that the paranormal research technology shown in this movie is as realistic as possible.  The portrayal of Keaton's character is believable, as well.  A cast of lesser known actors rather than A-list stars, except for Keaton, the movie appears less Hollywood.  This realism lends the movie more credibility so when you see the phenomenon, the event is a lot more terrifying than a regular horror movie.",1104624000,12,588,5.083333333333333

1520986,3,B00005JNNT,"My 3-star rating has nothing to do with Michael Keaton's performance...he is a wonderful actor.  The 3-star rating is because this movie wasn't sure what it was supposed to be!  It wasn't really a scary movie, but it was kind of a techno-thriller; however, I don't think that is how it turned out either.  It was confusing.  Nobody minds a movie that was confusing but clears everything up during the movie or even at the end, but this movie didn't.  Michael Keaton's character is grieving for his deceased wife when he discovers that he can still communicate with her through the static on his monitors...kind of.  She doesn't say a lot and there are lots of others in there with her.  She helps him rescue people who are about to die.  Then, there is that strange ending that I really can't explain (of course, I wouldn't because that would ruin the fun...but just to let you know that I couldn't if I wanted to).  The movie plods along in parts but does have some interesting parts, so it may be worth a rental.",1381708800,,1014,4.497267759562842
1520987,5,B00005JNNT,I thought that this movie was pretty good. Keaton is an excellent actor and can bring any boring movie to life with his presence. I thought that the plot was not bad and the story was pretty good. it's not a really scary movie but the fact that that can happen is pretty spooky what if you heard evp would that freak you out it would me. Keaton did an excellent job at his character he made you feel for him. that is good acting according to me. there is not a lot of spooky scenes in this film but if you have not seen it the ending is a surprise. all in all it was a good movie well acted and well directed. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1377561600,,665,3.8970588235294117

1521072,3,B00005JNNT,"White Noise(released Jan/05)was the first film I had seen Micahel Keaton in for a long time. The 80s were Keaton's salad days and he hasn't really done much of import since those days,sorry to say. However here we are with White Noise and a look at EVP,electronic voice phenomenon. It was an interesting concept,but the film I found was a bit uneven and lacklustre.
The plot finds Keaton as a successful architect who is married to a successful writer,and they both have a son. One night his wife is late coming home,so late that the police become involved and end up finding her abandoned car by a body of water. Hope springs eternal but a few days later leaving for work,he spots a man in a van outside his house. Later at work the same man is across the street. He confronts him and finds out the man,Raymond Price(Ian McNeice),has been receiving messages from his wife on the other side. He says she is dead. He gives the disbelieving Keaton a card,and leaves. After a few days the disappearance finally turns to one of eternal grief as his wife's body is found a few miles away from her car,washed ashore.
Keaton grieves but eventually turns to Raymond,not knowing what to expect. The man's house is filled with electronic devices to record sound and video...of the dead. Sure enough,the man produces a sound clip of his wife and Keaton breaks down. He also shows Keaton other recordings and some video of what he has been capturing,going on some 23 years. As time passes Keaton becomes more and more involved with Raymond and his work,as his wife's messages become more frequent and pronounced. He also meets one Sarah Tate(Deborah Kara Unger),who also goes to Raymond and lost a loved one like Keaton.
Sarah and Keaton become fast friends and start working in tandem. One night Keaton receives a phone call from Raymond about a breakthrough,and Keaton rushes over. However he finds Raymond's house in a mess and Raymond dead,underneath a pile of electronics. Keaton ends up buying his own electronic devices for home and becomes more involved with picking up these eery transmissions. But there are sinister forces as well as good ones coming through,and Keaton and Sarah are concerned. Keaton consults a psychic/medium who tells him that he is meddling in things he should not be into.
Keaton now is starting to get messages directly from his wife regarding things that are about to happen. In one instance,he ends up saving a babies life because of it. When a screen shot of Sarah,in some sort of distress,comes on the screen,Keaton takes her home and gives her a sleeping pill. He goes into the bathroom for a moment and when he returns she is standing on the edge of the balcony. She falls backwards and lands on a glass canopy far below. In the hospital,the face that appeared on the screen matches Sarah's now.
Keaton returns home only to find his own house trashed,but an image appears on the screen regarding a woman who has recently disappeared. He rushes to the location,which is an apparently abandoned old factory. He climbs each level until he locates some electronic equipment,then some tools. Around the corner he comes upon the missing woman strapped into a chair. He also confronts the murderer who says he was just doing the bidding of three evil entities,who appear up and behind Keaton. The man also admits to murdering Keaton's wife. Keaton tries to step forward to intervene but is taken down,ripped apart and thrown down several levels to his death,buy the entities. Just as the man is about to murder the kidnap victim,the police arrive and shoot him dead.
The film ends at Keatons funeral as we see Sarah in a wheelchair ,still alive. As the funeral attendants leave,strange shadows appear around her and a wind comes up. She looks one way,then suddenly back beside her. Cut to black.
The film does have some jump in your seat moments,mostly to do with electronic devices suddenly booming on,or voices yelling. There were some problems I had with the story,however. Firstly how did Sarah ever survive that fall out of her building onto the glass overhang?It really should have killed her. Also there is Keaton's son. One assumes Keatons wife was his mother,but after she passes on,another woman,whose relationship to Keaton I could not fathom(sister,ex?),comes by to babysit. More than once he tells his son to go with ""your mom""....? Lastly there was that psychic. As Keaton sat there at the start of the reading,she was giving out generalities anyone could have regurgitated. Keatons wife's disappearance was front page news and on TV,so chances are this psychic would also have known him. I thought she did. But the plot line says we have to believe she knew nothing of his wife. That's not easily swallowed.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp,for those with analog TVS like me. Extras include commentary,and three featurettes on real life EVP experiences and making your own.
All in all not a bad film,nor a great one. Just an average to above average scary movie about the EV phenomenon. There are scary moments and the film tries to build up some intensity but it never amounts to too much. Recommended.",1348444800,,5187,4.80963045912654

1521074,3,B00005JNNT,"I was out doing some shopping a while back and I ended up at this store called Big Lots. And they had this whole bin full of like $2 movies. White Noise just happened to be one of the many that I found in there and I thought, at $2 a piece, why not? White Noise wasn't really what I expected or remembered. For some reason I thought it was much, much better than what it was this time around. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either.

It's about this guy...played by Micheal Keaton but I can't remember his characters name right now. So his wife dies and then some guy tells him about EVP's and his wife reaching out to him. So he becomes like obsessed with the idea of his wife contacting him from the dead. I think that about sums it up. Some people die and things but nothing overly scary or anything.

I guess if you wanted to see it you could but if you didn't watch it you wouldn't be missing anything. It's not spectacular but, like I said, it was $2. I guess you can't really go wrong for $2 right?",1330041600,2,1012,4.106060606060606
1521075,5,B00005JNNT,"I have been looking for this movie for a while and had no luck finding it locally. So, I did a search for it here on Amazon and there it was, AND the added bonus was the price..",1302652800,,177,3.6842105263157894
1521076,3,B00005JNNT,"Imagine, if you will, that you are the head honcho at a major Hollywood movie studio and you're presented with two pitches for potential films. Pitch #1: ""Michael Keaton plays a guy whose wife dies unexpectedly, and he realizes that he can receive messages from her from the 'Other Side' via EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena... specifically, voices and images of the dead recorded from static, AKA white noise). However, this attracts other, dangerous spirits who'd like to cross over into our world.""

Sounds kind of cool and scary, right? Then you hear Pitch #2: ""Michael Keaton plays a guy who realizes that he's receiving messages in white noise from people who live in his area who are about to die in some awful way. However, these messages are somehow coming to him from the near future, and he has the power to rush out and try to prevent tragedies... if he can decipher the clues in time."" Wow, that sounds exciting too!

Yup, both of these concepts could have potentially become awesome thrillers. The problem is, the actual Michael Keaton movie ""White Noise"" is an ill-advised mashup of these two different plots, and the result, as you might expect, is mostly confusion.

This is a shame, because much of ""White Noise"" is suspenseful and rather creepy. Although things get off to a slow start, Keaton does a nice job playing a sympathetic character, and the film manages to draw the viewer's interest, up to a point. However, once the two concepts collide, bewilderment reigns supreme. The movie's internal logic starts changing often and unexpectedly, and the (SPOILER ALERT!) late introduction of a character who seemingly wandered into the movie off the set of a ""Hostel"" or ""Saw"" flick filming on a nearby soundstage only makes things worse. Keaton gamely tries to act like he's taking things seriously, but the movie increasingly goes off in so many different directions at once, it just becomes absurd.

As it stands, however, ""White Noise"" is still watchable for Keaton's performance, for the creepy stretches and scary moments, and for the intriguing possibilities of EVP in general. And the disc's extras are worth watching too... you get deleted scenes (including alternate versions with more graphic images), commentary, and some short documentaries featuring real-life EVP experts (they play several of the ghostly voices that they've allegedly recorded and demonstrate the basics of recording them). It's just too bad that the movie, ultimately, didn't realize that sometimes ""less is more."" If ""White Noise"" had narrowed its focus, it probably would have been a far more satisfying film.",1291161600,5,2612,5.067441860465117
1521077,5,B00005JNNT,"Geoffrey Sax's ""White Noise"" is one of the most overlooked, underrated films I have yet to encounter.  While I can't claim to have understood everything that takes place in the film, Michael Keaton (what happened to him) does a great job playing Jonathan Winters, a solid sort of everyman with a successful career in architecture and a lovely pregnant wife Anna (Chandra West) who disappears and is eventually found dead.

This is where we are introduced to ""EVP"" or ""Electronic Voice Phenomenon"".  EVP is a ""phenomenon"" in which a person ""hears the voices of the dead"" with the aide of sophisticated audio equipment (or just a tape recorder).

In despair over his wife's disappearance and demise, he makes the acquaintance of an odd man, Raymond Price (Ian McNeice) who insists that his wife has tried to make contact with him through ""recordings"" he has heard.  This man is clearly incautious and is either unaware or indifferent to the dangers this kind of experimentation can produce in a more orthodox spiritual sense.  And pretty soon not only is Jonathan a true believer, he is feeding into every ""message"" he receives from the other side, believing wholeheartedly that Anna is dictating warnings, omens, prophecies to him that he must act on.

And some of them turn out to be accurate.  He rescues a man dying in a car, nearly frozen to death, and finds the body of a man's wife.  The man wisely enough thanks him and then violently rebukes him at the offer of ""joining his sick f**king cult"".

An entity begins to hunt Michael, and just about everything he does is cursed in one way or another. He does not heed anything, and this is a chief flaw in the movie: when his best friend, Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger) is levitating on the ledge of a balcony as a result of Michael's continued delving into this dangerous process, he still does not take it as a sign that maybe he should at least slow down. The drive of his character is understandable as a result of losing his wife, but his complete lack of caution is not.

Believe whatever you want about EVP, this is one scary movie that should have gotten more attention. There are extras on the disc about EVP which feature ""experts"" in the field sharing their ""recordings"".  They are so cocksure that they are tapping into the spirit world that I found it a bit over the top, but people interested might enjoy it.

For the first 20 minutes we just have some emo guy moping around his house about his dead wife, and frankly I've seen that hundreds of times in the movies I've seen over the years.

Then we get an actual interesting character in the fat guy who sees and talks to dead people via his videos, TV and computer.  However he's quickly killed.  Later our main character in the form of Michael Keaton becomes obsessed with talking to the dead through the same means as his predecessor, so much in fact he doesn't pay attention to his kid and pawns him off on his friend/relative, (We're never really told who this woman is).

Turns out that he can now prevent people from being killed because the dead are showing him people who are going to die and where they are going to die in the near future, so he runs around like the guy from the show ""Early Edition"" from the 90's on CBS saving the day a few times.  In the end he himself is killed but he saves one last woman from being killed.

Never once is this movie ever scary.  In fact the only attempts at horror that this movie makes is a few jump scares from ghosts on TV screens and three vague humanoid figures who are always in the shadows or out of focus.  Not once did I find myself concerned for the main character's safety or well being.  I wasn't really scared at all because I could tell when a jump scare was coming, the music would get really quiet, the characters would slow way down or stop moving completely, and then bingo!  Jump scare.  That's not scary to me.  Any idiot can jump out of a closet in the middle of the night and yell ""BOO"" and scare you, once or twice in a movie is fine.  But if that's your primary means of scaring your audience, then you've failed as a film-maker to create fear.

1521144,5,B00005JNNT,"'White Noise' is one of the more enjoyable movies about the preposterous notion of communicating with the dead that I've ever seen. I'm not a Michael Keaton fan (I don't dislike him either), so I almost passed this movie over. Wow! Am I glad I didn't. This film is gripping from the start. Keaton's performance is beyond what I knew he was capable of. Setting aside the eeriness of the movie, one is intrigued by the interaction of the characters. There's a lesson to be learned here too. Don't let the life you have pass you by while trying to hold on to what is no longer there. Keaton's character becomes so engrossed with attempting to communicate with a dead loved one, that he neglects the living people that are still there in his life. And who still need him to be there for them. As for the HD version of this film, it's stunning. The standard was very well done and I didn't expect to see much difference in picture quality. Although some people smirk at the demise of HD DVD, they need to understand something important. If it weren't for HD DVD, Blue-Ray would have not been invented. Don't believe me? Read the history of the formats. But it's all good I have a Blue-Ray player too. For instance HD DVD has always used VC-1 as it's encoding. Blue-Ray started out still using versions of MPEG. Most Blue-Ray movies now use VC-1 or equivalent, but; would they have had it not been the standard set first by their competitor? I feel that any movie which uses special effects benefits greatly from any type of Higher Definition discs. And 'White Noise' definitely does. If it is a movie you'll be watching repeatedly, and showing to others. Then, it's worth buying in either one of the Hi-Def formats.",1245715200,2,1710,4.555194805194805

1521146,2,B00005JNNT,"Michael Keaton is wasted in an incoherent film whose only interest was bypassed in the pursuit of excitement which never materialized. The only interest was the dilemma of a child whose mother has died and who then has to confront an obsessive delusional father. Even if one cares to accept, as I am willing to do, the theatrical convention that communication between the dead and the living is possible when a scriptwriter finds it necessary for the plot, the lack of any firm backbone to the film pays few returns for suspension of disbelief. It is never quite clear, granted that the grieving husband, Keaton, would be susceptible to what he otherwise would consider irrational, why a fuzzy image on a computer monitor and an indistinct vocalization would be so convincing.
Enough said. Unless you are a devoted historian of ghost stories whatever may be their quality, or simply an obsessive fan who must see everything in the genre so as to avoid the sensation that you might have missed the really good one, I should give this one a pass in favor of watching once again one of your old favorites.",1230854400,,1102,4.744791666666667

The music score is terrifying.  White Noise is difficult to watch during the day, almost impossible at night, especially the end.

Not to say that White Noise is a shallow film, cuz it definatly isn't shallow. This movie's strength lyes in its mood and emotion and its topic alone is very deep witnin itself for sure.

In short, its about a man who loses a loved one, and is introduced to communication with the dead, and many things accure the more he delves into this phenomona.

Anyways, i skiped this movie in the theaters becouse i didn't think it recieved a lot of good reviews by critics, but i saw it on dvd a while ago and i ended up really interested in the EVP idea in the film (Thats an actual phenomona that people research regarding communication with deceased people or spirts.

This might of not got any accolades, but ya know a movie did its job when it has you researching its topic afterwards, not too mention the fact that, to me, it was genuinly scary, and it didn't need any gore or extreme violance to do so, which is commendable.

I was impressed and even moved by all of what the dvd of this movie offered. Its special features are some of the best special features i ever seen on a dvd. I actually feel the special features are just as essential to watch as the film itself, it goes hand in hand.

So, i finally got to buy this movie at the store, and im glad i did, becouse the film is thought provoking and very creepy; along with special features that are real fascinating and interesting, very informative and  even usefull, if you can believe that. The dvd has a lot of value i think, becouse those special features really make the movie worth buying.

You get actual featurettes on the whole EVP thing, which actual EVP specialists and organization. And one that takes you on an investigation of 3 or so locations to communicate. They show you the process of recording and play back the actually stuff they picked up, its very interesting and makes you think and wonder.  Lastly , they have a how to  feature that shows you basicly all you need to start recording EVP yourself, which you might find surprisingly affordable and user friendly and practical.
 Not to mention theres a commentary with Michael Keaton and someone else, which is cool.

 If you're at all interested in the super natural, this film can be found on Amazon for such a bargon price, its definatly worth buying i think. The special features little bonus that i actually liked and don't over look.

The acting and storyline/screen play get the job done, pretty average; though the idea behind the film is strong. Its a creepy movie that makes me a little freaked out to walk around my house in the dark, and ive watched Silence Of The Lambs, and that didn't bug me afterwards, as far as its effect it had. Though im not comparing the two films in any way shape or form.

1521261,3,B00005JNNT,"Normally I get angry when I feel people unfairly bash a horror movie, because the horror style is without a doubt my cup of tea. However, with White Noise, the lack of a scary atmosphere kind of hurt the plot and lowers the rating.

I agree with the people who say that, as the movie went along, it began to lose much of its scariness and became more of a regular mystery suspense.  The word ""suspense"" is sort of exaggerated, because I wasn't afraid of anything happening on screen, and I wasn't particularly interested in what was happening either.  Okay, the scenes that had to do with the people who have ""crossed over"" shown on the television sets was interesting, because thinking about the afterlife is a mystery for everyone and worth finding out what other peoples opinions and interpretations of death are about (in this case, wondering about the opinion of the movie writers).  In that respect, White Noise works.

The scenes showing Michael Keaton's dead wife on the TV screen were exciting and certainly the highlights of the film because these scenes allowed you to think to yourself ""how much will she reveal about herself to help Michael understand she has crossed over and is trying to communicate with her alive husband"".  Disagree you might, but I bet as you were watching the movie you wanted her to eventually be able to communicate with Michael Keaton clearly and perfectly because death is a mystery for all of us.  There was always something in the way making it difficult for Michael to see her, and communicate with her.  This is good writing.

Besides that, some of the scary scenes that caught my attention were at the very beginning when Michael Keaton was staying up late and waiting for his wife to return home, and, it was real late at night, and as he was watching the clock at a specific time he leaves the room for a few seconds to return and realize that the ticking sounds of the clock just STOPPED.  This was a good moment.

Later on Michael Keaton began to see strange things, and this brought a sense of excitement and a question of ""what's happening"" from the viewer.  It led me to believe that more unexpected scary moments like this were on the way, with Michael continuing to see strange things at unexpected moments, but unfortunately the plot turned more into a normal mystery after that, and I lost interest.  Don't get me wrong, the eerie spirits of (a few) of the dead people continued to come back, but nothing too interesting took place.  Then again, this may have been a good thing.  Revealing too much about the afterlife to Michael Keaton would have made the plot seem either tacky or fake.

The ending is still a bit strange to me.  Strange in that, it makes sense, but I have mixed feelings about it.  I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, so let's just say something happens at the very end that's supposed to only happen at night.  At least, the rest of the movie led us to believe it only happened at night.  And then the movie ends.  Having this thing happen in the afternoon for the very first time at the end of the movie didn't make sense to me.

Still, it had enough good moments to watch once or twice.  But I thought the movie overall got kind of slow during certain parts and that drops the rating a bit, along with the lack of scary moments.  A good effort though.",1169856000,3,3339,4.517470881863561

The ghosts weren't very scary, the story became more of a murder-mystery, and it lacked... horror!

Initially, the film seemed promising about a guy trying to contact his dead wife from the beyond using electronic devices, and by doing so opening the door for 'other', darker spirits to enter our realm. Then the plot changes to a mystery, where the movie goes downhill...

They had the actors, they had an ideal concept for a good ghost film but they fell short with the plot...The PG-13 rating had to hurt also. Now having the DVD i saw the deleted scenes which would've helped the film, but changed it to an R rating.  Oh well...

It keeps a few good jumps and jolts, being able to scare you at the best moments, but, that doesn't make up for the endless minutes of Michael Keaton staring at a static filled screen and then doing things that no person in their right mind would do without bringing along backup or at least a weapon. At one point, I even yelled at the screen (much to my girlfriends chagrin), ""Keaton! If you go through that door and something kicks your butt, you brought it on yourself idiot!"".

1521264,2,B00005JNNT,"`White Noise' has one brilliant idea in it, but unlike `The Sixth Sense' and `The Ring' it fails to make effective use of it. It is about EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomenon, strange sound that is recorded on tape with  other mysterious noise, supposedly coming from the world of the dead.

Michael Keaton plays Jonathan Rivers, a bereaved husband who thinks he received a message from his dead wife. With a help from an EVP expert (Ian McNeice), he tries to make contact with Anna (Chandra West), but as it turns out, he receives more messages than he had bargained for.

The first half of the film gives successfully spooky atmosphere, but it starts to look incredible even by the standard of supernatural thriller, and it also gets silly as it goes on due to the weak and confusing script. The messages contain some part that suggest some dead people know almost everything (only in your neighborhood, though). In the contrived second half the mysterious messages, which were originally said to have come from `the other side,' turn out something different and even the existence of evil is implied, which can ignore and violate the law of physics. The film changes its rules constantly, making everything hopelessly messy.

In spite of intense acting from Michael Keaton, and good support from Deborah Kara Unger, none of them can save the film from the mess because the characters they play are absolutely unreasonable. `White Noise' begins as `The Sixth Sense,' and ends as `The Ring,' but it becomes neither of them with the muddled conclusion that is more head-scratching than the fate of Samara the video girl.",1160179200,,1619,4.876363636363636

Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) has an ideal, stable life.  He's an architect and has just discovered that his wife, Anna (Chandra West), a popular author with a book about to be released, is pregnant.  Things take a drastic turn when Anna's abandoned vehicle is discovered but she has disappeared.

Weeks pass without a clue to Anna's whereabouts.  Then one day, Jonathan is approached by Raymond Price (Ian McNeice), an expert on EVP who has been receiving messages from Anna.  Unconvinced at first, Jonathan then contacts Raymond when strange events begin to happen.

Becoming more obsessed with what he's hearing, Jonathan begins to hear from a number of people from the other side including Anna who seems to give him messages regarding living people in life threatening situations.  But not everything Jonathan hears is good.  Will he learn about the more sinister messages before it's too late?

There are a number of things I liked about ""White Noise"".  A story about Electronic Voice Phenomenon was interesting and original.  It seemed to explain EVP in a way that even if you were unfamiliar with it, you weren't completely lost to what was happening in the movie.

The movie also had some excellent spooky moments.  One in particular is Jonathan receiving a call on his cell phone.  After realizing the call is from Anna's phone, he rushes home, opens a bag with her cell phone in it.  While he's holding her phone, his cell phone rings and guess which number pops up!

""White Noise"" had a decent story and good pacing right until the last twenty or so minutes of the film.  During this time things seemed to be a little rushed which led to some confusing moments.  It seemed moviemakers were trying to tie up all the loose ends in a small time frame while trying to give viewers a quick resolution to what was happening.

Based on a man named Jonathan Rivers(Michael Keaton) whos wife dies in a  car accident. Upon this tragic event, Jonathan grieves for his wife and sooner hears of a man who claims that his wife has made contact with him from the after-life through EVP(Electronic Voice Phenomenon). Eventually after Keatons communications with his dead wife he begins to believe that these communications are some sort of warnings from his wife, which brings this EVP more of an obsession to him.

The first thing that really caught my attention is when Keaton receives a phone call realising that it is coming from the phone of his dead wife. There wasn't anything actually scary about it but in terms of something chilling or spooky, it wasn't a bad attempt. The most interesting thing from the film was the events of EVP. It has a good deal of a chilling atmosphere within the unclear sounds and video recordings. Although this was only a success through the first half of the film.  When it comes to horrors, its what we do not see that scares us. Less is more is the phrase. This is where White Noise started to go a little down hill. The EVP sounds and video recordings began to reveal themselves to clearly letting the viewers know exactly what is being said or shown on screen. Although, some of the instant jump frights worked well in this movie. But the ending is a bit of a let-down, adding more with CGI, making even ghost images more solid. Sure it has its surprises, but it wasn't enough to make the ending feel more intense.

Above all this, Keaton does give us a great performance throughout the film that kind of makes up for some of its flaws. Overall, it starts off decently but eventually goes a little downhill. Good, but nothing special.",1153440000,2,2067,4.652054794520548

I've walked out of theaters during the credits disappointed before. I've walked out content before. But never before had I been so apathetic to what had happened on the screen. White noise flirts with the concept of electronic signals picking up messages from ""the other side,"" which sounded as if it could be genuinely chilling. But no... It was a convoluted, self-involved Scooby Doo mystery that decided it wasn't going to stay on the same page as the viewer from the start.

If done properly, of course. Unfortunetly, White Noise goes the entirely opposite way. What might have been an interesting study of loss and our inability to let the ones we lose go, is in this movie reduced to a bewildering 98 minutes of inane, asinine, insipid murder mystery that in no way even begins to add up. There are so many lapses of logic and plot holes in this stink that its hard to find any real story here whatsoever. There's no meat to the story. No bread. No condiments. The movie is starving to death, and as it plods along on increasingly tired legs, it simply withers away and dies, having to resort to some slasher movie-esque reveal. The finale of the movie is a complete head-scratcher. WTF? And then you have poor Michael Keaton giving the most stalwart performance of his career. I felt like screaming at the screen.  Lighten up!  But the movie takes itself so seriously, seemingly unaware of its own deep festering flaws and overall brainlessness that you can't even laugh at it.

Things were working well. I was intrigued by the fat man's claim of being in contact with the dead wife. It felt a little rushed and unfinished even at that point because the wife's death sounded suspicious at first and then later cut and dried. Somehow she fell, hurt her head and broke her arm and was unable to escape a rising tide? Maybe I missed something. What was she doing there? Why didn't the husband try to rescue her sooner?

Keaton has some scary moments when he's being contacted through the phone and various electronic devices. I was feeling chills and then it started to feel too much like they were trying to give me chills.

Keaton becomes a big believer which seemed odd since he was a professional in the movie. More skepticism would have seemed likely. At this point in the movie I thought maybe Keaton was being taken advantage of. I even thought the lady who also claimed to have a break through was one of the fat man's confederates. Some sort of confidence scheme, but as it turned out everyone was sincere.

Keaton is in love and yet he seems to be going through a series of other women in no time at all. I thought he was still grieving for his wife. Then someone ends up standing on railing several floors up while asleep. It just didn't make any sense at all except to impress us with the power of these shadowy things from the other side of the grave and then finally there's the ending which didn't make any sense at all to me even though I recognized the workman.

I watched the ending again with commentary on to see if I could get some insight as to what they were going for. The first thing I noticed was how flat the director was. He talked about technical things, but he just didn't have the enthusiasm in explaining things that people who love their movies do. All I got out of him was that he was lucky to get a big abandoned department store for his ending when he originally wanted a house because Keaton was supposed to be an architect. The director was happy with the big setting because it allowed him more options in setting up cameras. The thing is it didn't help with the story at all. What was that? Having no info from the movie I decided the site was computer connection to hell, lol. I wondered if it was a cable hookup or just dialup. The workman who was supposed to be an unspeakably evil minion ended up being of such little importance that the cops dropped him after only five seconds on screen.

1521306,3,B00005JNNT,"It is rumored that prior to his death, Thomas Edison was working on an invention that would allow people to communicate with the dead. ""White Noise"" is based on the concept of electronic voice phenomenon (EVP), which is the alleged communication of the deceased through tape recorders and other electronic devices. It's an intriguing concept, but unfortunately ""White Noise"" is one of those horror movies that start out fabulous but then fall apart at the very end.

Michael Keaton plays Jonathan Rivers, a man who is grieving over the tragic death of his wife, Anna (Chandra West). Shortly after his wife's death, Jonathan received a visit from a mysterious man (Ian McNeice) who claims that Anna has contacted him ""from the other side."" Jonathan becomes obsessed with EVP, desperate to communicate with his late wife. In doing so, however, Jonathan unwittingly becomes entangled in the lives (and deaths) of others, and ultimately puts his own life at risk.

""White Noise"" boasts an excellent cast and an intriguing storyline. Good horror movies are few and far between these days, but I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time while watching this, completely freaked out by what was happening on the screen. Unfortunately, though, the film completely crapped out during the last five minutes or so, like most modern horror movies tend to do. I don't even really understand what happened at the end of the film because it was so freakin' WEIRD! The ending completely ruined the movie for me, and instead of being spooked, I'm just pissed off.

1521349,4,B00005JNNT,"I take it as an article of faith that WHITE NOISE the movie is in no way based on WHITE NOISE, the classic novel by Don De Lillo so many postmoderns adore, but Deborah Kara Unger is certainly acting as though she had never heard the news and is trying the best she can to give a reasonable screen interpretation of De Lillo's trademark disconnects and fleecy philosophy.  As she did in Cronenberg's CRASH, Unger steals the movie out from under her more expressive co-stars.  She's not ""sleepwalking"" as many critics affirm, indeed what she's doing is really the opposite of sleepwalking, whatever that might be.  She enters a scene all bristly like a beautiful, statuesque hedgehog, with every one of her sensory cells on high alert.  As she plays Sara, the bookstore owner whose fiance died eight months before, you wonder why the screenwriters didn't make the dead man her husband.  Why hold the line at ""fiance""?  Is it to encourage viewers into thinking that hey, maybe she didn't really love him, maybe she's ready to move on to assuage Michael Keaton's grief at losing his wife (played briefly by Chandra West).  She's become addicted to fat Raymond's EVP sessions in which she finally makes a breakthrough, realizing that the mumbled words her dead fiance was saying were ""Sara, yes.""

Later Michael Keaton realizes that everyone who appears on the white noise broadcasts and podcasts was actually alive at the time their signals were being transmitted around the world, visible only to trained, or untrained, EVP readers.  That makes sense to me.  Does that mean that Sara's fiance had been filmed saying ""Sara, yes,"" while still alive?  And does that mean that the three tall shadowy figures had him murdered from beyond the grave?  With her tall, gaunt, utterly vulnerable and broad face, Unger manages to suggest all these plot points with but a single sideways look.  She's totally involved in her acting, and at the same time that pathetic glance seems to be pleading and remonstating with her agents, ""Let me out of here!""  You get the same doubleness of affect watching the later films of Marilyn Monroe, in which she always seems to be waiting for approval from someone to the side of the camera, Lee or Paula Strasberg perhaps, Svengalis to her poor Trilby.

I've read dozens of comments from my other Amazon compatriots about this movie and no one has been able to decipher why Deborah Kara Unger a) takes that mysterious sleeping pill or b) changes her mind as soon as Michael Keaton leaves her bedroom to take a few aspirin.  She winds up on the railing of her balcony; narratologically speaking it's no surprise, but her doing so has no real motive in the plot unless you figure she's actually in cahoots with the real conspirators.  With a lesser actress, someone like, oh, say, Gwyneth Paltrow or Reese Witherspoon, she wouldn't have gone off the balcony at all.  She or her agents would have put their foot down right off and said, ""Michael Keaton hasn't made a movie in years, let him take the fall.""  But Unger gives everything to her art and for that reason alone she (and to a lesser degree the incomparable Chandra West) makes seeing WHITE NOISE a supreme lesson in the power of Thespis over the humdrum nothingness of Hollywood-funded Vancouver-based filmmaking.",1138492800,,3292,4.804964539007092
1521350,1,B00005JNNT,"In White Noise we are introduced to John Rivers, an architect

living in (what appears to be) Toronto ( Note to Canada - enough with the brushed metal as architectural element already! ). With freshly-pregnant wife and son (by another woman) leading The Perfect Life

{ ...beep .... beep ....beep. it's a telegraph, sir, things are about to go downhill }

UNTIL

his wife dies and her body washes up days later by an old pier on the water.

We are sad. John is sad.

John is soon contacted by an aficionado of ""EVP"" - within the narrative world of White Noise, a world that is like our aniseptic, scientific world, we learn that the dead can leave traces of their voices and likeness on the electromagnetically sensitive recording media of our modern times. This phenomenon, EVP (electronic voice phenomenon), allows a living person to commune with the dead.

Now this is an interesting setup, it's a re-hash of the Faustian

bargain: man, ever hungry for forbidden power and knowledge makes the deal with the man at the crossroads who casts no shadow (Robert Johnson mythos, Faust, many-a Lovecraft protagonist) and begins toexperience the exultation of this power / knowledge.

In White Noise, Johnathan is able to communicate with his

deceased wife via EVP and thus the Faustian bargain takes its

inevitable turn into the ""unintended consequences"" (see ""The Monkey's Paw"") realm. It's not long before his monkey's paw, er,  hobby starts doing its corrupting work - compelling Johnathan to choose between living in an artificial world (communing with the dead with this high-tech Ouija board) or doing the hard work of ""getting over it"" and living in our world.

Now, this could have been a very interesting bit of drama - you must

overcome loss by moving beyond, by growing, by challenging - not by

seeking a spiritual salve in the disembodied voices from the beyond. Everyone who endures the death of a loved one (""To love is to bury"" sayeth the Cowboy Junkies) faces flights of fancy into the supernatural and then faces the intractable truth of mortality. The movie works in this general direction but then...then....then....

it completely blows it

{...spoilers below, you may want to cut out if you plan on seeing

this...}

The story blows it because all of a sudden the menacing spirits mixed

in on the tapes solidify and attack John.

Now wait, we were in a scientific world, not the horror-worlds of

Nightmare on Elm Street or Poltergeist where we

accept that supernatural menace can physically hurt us -- no, EVP was

a phenomenon of our ""modern"" world - an unintended and menacing side

effect from the beyond. They don't physically hurt us, they conquer us from our psyche out (much scarier!) - what the hell is this curve ball!?

The screetwriters totally messed this up! They had all the set-ups

for an exploration of the curse of the Faustian bargain and they blew

it. Instead of John's unrelling into madness courtesy of his

obsession with EVP or his personal triumph over this crutch -

but instead the screenwriters get lazy and basically give up.

This is my principal reason for why White Noise was a bad

movie. There were other reasons (too many driving scene shots,

lackluster dialog for a performer of Keaton's talent, etc.) but it's

a real loser.

I won't go over the plot yet again, as you can read that in other reviews and probably have already done so before now. I will just say that it was very creative using EVP as a premise for the movie, and the idea that dead people are like just like living people: not all of them are nice. It is a good question for those interested in contacting the dead: why should they all be nice, when some may have been complete you-know-whats in this life.

Through movie, there is enough to make you jump, and despite my best efforts at not making a fool of myself, I jumped a lot. It is a hard movie to maintain a detached distance to. The pain that the main character goes through is gutsy and in-your-face with Keaton's style of intensity. His all-consuming drive to contact his wife causes him to see what he wants, not always what is trying to be communicated.

This is a movie that will intrigue as well as giving you a bit of a fright every now and then. It is also not a movie I would watch alone and then walk home on a dark and cloudy night.

Michael Keaton plays a grieving widower who can't let go and get on with his life.

At first the lead character shrugs him off as a quack, but then things start to happen that can't be explained ... phone calls from his dead wife's cell phone, which is hidden in a drawer, things moving around without obvious cause ... finally he calls the paranormal researcher. With his new friend, through EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), he believes he can see and hear his wife speaking to him. EVP becomes an obsession to him. I won't say more lest I ruin the plot.

You need to completely suspend belief for this movie. Though there are a million explanations for EVP, you will believe it just long enough to get creeped out by this movie.

She attempts to contact him from beyond, but we require the assistance of a EVP specialist to help establish that contact. That's where all hell breaks loose, literally.

Keaton starts monitoring his own bank of TVs and radios to capture spirit communications. He finds that the spirits are warning him of things to come, but there is more. He finds the truth behind his wife's death, and even more than he bargained for.

1521411,2,B00005JNNT,"I have always been a fan of Michael Keaton. His acting is of such superior quality that as one watches him ply his trade, it's nearly magical. His specialty is that regardless of role, he proves believable and convincing. Such is the case with his new film, White Noise. In this role, he plays Jonathan Rivers, a happily married and successful architect, who after losing his wife is visited by those who study EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomena. Seeking some way to communicate with his deceased wife, he struggles to understand and accept the premises that the living can indeed communicate with the dead. The film, like the script is palatable enough, but hardly worthy of Keaton's superior talent. One actor in the film who does enter a surprising performance is Raymond Price who plays Ian McNeice.

  It had been a while since I have seen Michael Keaton in anything, so I rented White Noise (2005).
  Anna Rivers (Chandra West) is having a great morning, a loving husband, Jonathan (Michael Keaton) and a second child on the way.  She is on her way to see the cover of her new book at the publishers.
  Later that night, Jonathan comes home with flowers, but Anna never made it back home.  They found the car, but no body yet.  They believe she fell and hit her head on the rocks while fixing a flat tire.  The water may have swept her out.  Three weeks later, the police come to Jonathan's front door with the bad news.
  A strange man, Raymond Price (Ian McNaica), told him his wife is dead before the police did.  Actually the man is deeply into E.V.P.--the reading of the dead.  When Jonathan receives calls on his cell phone from Anna, it begins to drive him crazy enough to visit Raymond Price.

1521417,3,B00005JNNT,"This is a non-spoiler review of ""White Noise"" even though most readers probably know all the plot twists by now.

""White Noise"" is a fairly suspenseful, largely nongraphic suspense/horror film that does a good job of conjuring up a perpetually creepy mood. True, part of the credit goes to the drizzly Vancouver locations, but it's nice to see nevertheless. At heart, this is a B-movie, full of large lapses in logic and several plot twists that came out of nowhere. I'm willing to forgive the film these flaws because it's quite honest about its Saturday Afternoon Double Feature pedigree.

Michael Keaton's performance is the greatest strength of the movie. He starts off as a married man who is perhaps a little too contented. (I suspect that his buddy-buddy relationship with his ex-wife in scattered scenes suggest his character has lots of repression issues.) Following his second wife's death, Keaton's character becomes more and more obsessed with the possibility of communicating with the dead via the static in videotapes, radio, and the like. Even if such communication were true, his constant obsession is definitely an unhealthy one.

I admired his performance in this film. Naysayers may tell you that he's over-the-top but that's exactly what this film needs to jerk itself out of its Made-for-TV mode. In fact, I'd compare what he does in this film to what Vincent Price did for similar B-movies in the 1950s and 60s. He takes what could be a throwaway film and turns it into something to viewer can take seriously for 90 minutes. I came to this film expecting to hate it and yet I enjoyed it almost entirely because of Keaton's talents.

Other reviewers have highlighted this movie's flaws. I won't repeat what they've written because I want this review to be short. In a nutshell, while ""White Noise"" is far from an unforgettable, gripping chiller, it's equally far from being an idiot's delight. Give it a try as a rental and see what you think. Just stay away from static on your TV screen!",1125705600,2,2010,4.868421052631579
1521445,1,B00005JNNT,"White Noise, is the longest, most confusing,""techno-horror"" movie I have seen in awhile. The trailer that I saw at the movie theater had the explanation of EVP, Electric Voice Phenomena, when the dead communicate to the living through electrical devices like radios, Televisions, Cell phones (I guess they have unlimited nights and weekends on the other side `can you hear me now?'), they played real life EVP, the woman saying ""get out of my house"" and ""I love you"", it was really creepy. SO naturally I thought the movie based on these phenomena would also be just as creepy, but I was so wrong. The entire first 10-15 minutes was excruciatingly slow, we have the husband John, and the wife Anna, and there is this kid, who I didn't catch his name because he is freakishly quiet and really just background the whole time, I was confused on who the kid belonged to. The pregnant wife goes missing, and then dead, and thus begins the EVP, through a boom box, cell phone and other things, We get to see an EVP specialist who spends to much time indoors, and a grieving woman who needs some makeup badly (you would think her dead fiance would tell her through EVP to invest in some lipstick at least) We get some baddies that are represented through three shadows and a lot of cussing. John is supposed to be our hero, and I feel nothing at all for him! Who cares about his dead wife and kid when he doesn't even pay attention to the kid he has now? People die, babies are saved, and the three phantom cursers are holding some chick hostage (who I care nothing for, hello? Character development much?) In this entire confusing boring plot there are lots of TVs and computers with static and morphed faces and voices, but it's not scary at all! They should have made him hit the TV and Bam! A re-run of Method and Red pops up, now that is frightening! Michael Keaton is not an actor with a lot of range, his reactions and expressions are deadpan, and there were no other semi-big names in the movie to help him carry the load. In the end, he follows the clues his dead wife leads him to ""go now my love"" (yawn), and he finds the woman held captive by......a freaking construction worker? What? Who is being controlled by the three mahatma ghandi apparitions? They surround our hero and I guess tickle him to death, and breath stank rotten electrified breath and he topples over the edge, I wasted an hour and a half of my life to have nothing explained to me! Who were the spooks? Why was the construction dude murdering women?  Did they control him? How? Why did they trash his place? And the most important question of all WHO green lighted this Poo-fest? If I were in the spirit world and had a chance to communicate with the living I would definitely say  ""DO NOT WATCH WHITE NOISE......OR LISTEN TO JESSICA SIMPSON ON THIS RADIO""",1125014400,4,2831,4.495145631067961
1521446,3,B00005JNNT,"""White Noise"" uses EVP(electronic voice phenomena) in an attempt to creep out the crowd.  Actual EVP occurs when someone records voices of supposed dead people who are speaking from beyond.  This film tries to bank on that by combining the recordings with a murderous group of nasty spirits who use TVs, video, tapedecks, etc. to crossover and do some evil deeds.

In the beginning of the film, Michael Keaton loses a loved one in an accident.  She in turn calls him the next night and leaves a message on his answering machine.  Then she does it again on the next night.  Soon, Keaton meets a gentleman who actually studies and logs numerous EVP recordings in an attempt to help those who've lost people.  Here's where my first question is.  How is listening or watching tapes of dead people help those who are grieving?  Keaton soon becomes engulfed in a sea of high-tech recording equipment and blows off his own son in an attempt to hear more recordings from the grave.

Eventually, people begin to die off and Keaton becomes a suspect.  Once he figures out what is going on, he tries to become a sort of supernatural detective.  Instead of helping the grieving, he attempts to save those who are about to die.

In the end,  things get a little murky and we never really learn who or what the killer or killers really are and why they are killing people.  The actual study of EVP is very interesting, but unfortunately Hollywood took a cool concept and threw it into a sloppily directed flick.

In short, I'd keep this one as a rental or pay-per-view.  Some folks will be pulled in by the EVP hook, but this movie just doesn't come together well enough to be worthy of multiple viewings.",1124496000,2,1691,4.583333333333333
1521447,1,B00005JNNT,"Where to start?

Ok, with out giving anything away.. there is a scene in the movie where ... someone.. warns Michael Keaton's character that he should not be getting involved with EVP, that meddling with EVP was very dangerous, and that he should leave it to the experts.  Ok fine, but if this EVP thing is THAT dangerous, then why do they include a remedial tutorial on 'do it yourself EVP' as one of the special features?

The signature of a good horror movie is to build up the suspense and still be able to scare the viewer, even if they know something is about to happen. This movie atteMpts to scare the viewer bY startling them.  It's like hiding behind a door and yelling boo when someone enters the room.  The only scare is the fact that you weren't expecting anything.  Once the jolt wears off, it really wasn't that scary.. Same can be said about this movie..

While the whole movie pretty much sucked, the worst part was the ending battle between good and evil... The viewer had absolutley no clue as to what was happening.  A better version of the battle appeared in the special footage... They should have edited the movie to have included that part instead.

1521451,4,B00005JNNT,"I know some people think this film is seven kinds of awful, but I was not disappointed in the slightest by it.  Maybe it's the fact that I was already familiar with the subject of EVP.  If you're introduced to this sort of phenomenon in a vacuum, it does sound incredibly hokey.  I'm not saying it's real, but I've heard some pretty spooky stuff on some professional recordings.  If you can't suspend your disbelief and allow yourself to imagine that the events taking place in this movie are possible, I daresay it's impossible to enjoy the film.  Of course, White Noise goes far beyond EVP as we know it.  The main character not only hears voices from those who have passed on, he starts seeing and hearing things that have yet to take place.  But I suppose I'm getting ahead of myself here.

Michael Keaton plays architect Jonathan Rivers, whose very happy life is torn asunder when his wife goes missing and is later found dead.  Before the body is found, he's visited by a doughy stranger who tells him that his wife is dead and that she has been trying to communicate with him.  He leaves the disbelieving Jonathan his card, but eventually Jonathan goes to see him.  This fellow Raymond (Ian McNeice) is basically obsessed with EVT, and he has used all sorts of high-dollar recording equipment to record white noise TV signals; the tapes, when played later, often contain sounds and images of the dead, and he has helped communicate messages from the beyond to those left behind.  He also picks up a good bit of hostile language and images of rather disquieting manifestations, but that just goes with the territory (dying doesn't make a mean person any nicer).  Jonathan changes his tune (albeit a little too quickly and easily) when he hears his wife's voice on one of Raymond's tapes, and he immediately becomes obsessed with EVT himself, setting up all sorts of recording equipment of his own.  He is perplexed when he learns that he has been receiving some signals from folks before their imminent deaths, and he interprets all of this as a charge from his dead wife to try and help these people.  I myself would interpret his wife's injunctions as a warning against the dangerous manifestations increasingly making their presence felt in the recordings, but I'm not the heroic sort of fellow that Jonathan seems to be.  Everything leads up to a perfectly satisfying conclusion; it would have been easy to blow the whole movie at the end, but that didn't happen.

White Noise features a number of jump-worthy moments, and certain scenes are eerie enough to make you feel unsettled.  I also happen to think the plot holds together quite well, although it's definitely out there.  I have sort of an indifferent attitude toward Michael Keaton, but I thought he played his part very effectively in this movie.  I can't see how some lose sympathy with his character, a man obsessed with contacting his recently deceased and greatly loved wife.  This film does not deliver an accurate accounting of EVP, but it's a movie, not a documentary.  In my opinion, this is a highly suspenseful, intriguing, pretty darn impressive little thriller.",1123632000,,3143,4.781481481481482

1521453,2,B00005JNNT,"I was excited to see this movie because the previews were intense and I'm always interested in fiction that has to do with the paranormal (not because I believe any of it, mind you), but because i feel being spooked is much more entertaining in a scarey movie than simply being grossed out.

 Sometimes, however, you come across a movie that tries so hard to be creepy and dark it ends up being, well, silly. This is one such film.

 A man grieving over the death of his wife is suddenly contacted by her through EVP and is directing him in places that three beings are causing death and devastation... and he's never quite there on time. Of all the spirits coming through why is hers the only one to seem to see what the three beings are going to do next, or is she trying to lead her husband to the truth of her death? And what are the three beings? Aliens? Ghosts? Demons? Larry, Moe and Curly? There are quite a few awesome connections Michael Keaton's character seems to share with women, but what is it and why?

 If you like your thrillers to weave, mystify, frighten and wrap up, then this clearly is not the best movie for you. If you're more into being creeped out and drawing your own conclusion, then perhaps catch this on your cable network or borrow it from a friend before adding it your movie collection.",1123459200,2,1320,4.389344262295082
1521454,2,B00005JNNT,"I was so excited to se this film, but am disappointed for several reasons.  One, I didn't have any sympathy for the protagonist, especially during this recession when he lives in a palatial home and loves his job.  Second, The sound quality of this DVD is TERRIBLE.  I am not sure if it was this poor in theatres, but if it was, audiences were deafened by the sound of the cell phone ringing and a cabinet door suddenly slamming, but could not hear most of the background in-scene sounds (low volume conversations, background music,...) To hear these sounds, I had to crank my DVD player's sound up to 10, much higher than most movies (which are fine at say 23-25).  The sudden ""jump out at you"" sounds would boom deafeningly, and then I had to strain to catch a conversation.  Third, the ending was truly terrible and made no sense.  Perhaps it was written to perplex audience members who are  unwilling to think about how a solution fits the proposed problem, you know, the audience members who just say ""wow - deep!""  Lastly, the treatment of EVP was a bit moralistic.  The film might have been titled ""Just say NO to EVP!!!""  It felt like an after-school special about why little mary and ted should not play with tape recorders.  PATRONIZING!!!! I did enjoy the corny extras on Special Features, especially the ""actual EVPs,"" but by that time the film had convinced me that if I listened, Lucifer's three henchmen would come and break my legs before giving me a heart attack for no reason.

1521505,1,B00005JNNT,"This was, quite simply, one of the silliest and most insignificant movies I have seen in a long, long time. The entire premise is absurd and unconvincing, and the ending is so amateurish that you are left shaking your head in disbelief. You are occasionally startled by a loud noise, but not once will you be truly frightened or convinced that any of this nonsense is even remotely real or possible.

I generally love Michael Keaton and am a great fan of supernatural thrillers, but I was totally let down on both fronts. M.K. exudes not a single trace of the edgy charisma, humor, and intellect that usually distinguishes his performances. He (and we) spend what seems like hours and days looking at snowy screens and listening to indistinct static, with an occasional groan or whimper. Just to be sure, however, that we ignoramuses in the audience fully comprehend the grand significance of what is transpiring, occasionally the fuzzy images become completely distinct, the voices become very clear, all spooky subtlety is lost and we are essentially told what to think. There is no respect for the audience...but then again, if there were any, this movie would never have been released.

The childish manipulation is obvious and very tiresome, but the worst insult is reserved for the truly lousy ending....lots of swirly, silly ghosts and loud noises that grate on our nerves rather than fears. I swear that I have seen Halloween plays at my daughter's grade school that were more suspenseful and displayed better plot and direction. This is an absolute bomb, and I don't mean that in a good way.

The Special Features on the DVD consist mainly of a sweet little old couple running around deserted buildings with a $5 Radio Shack tape recorder saying things like ""Speak to us""....and of course, after they are allowed to ""privately process"" their recordings there are a few unusual beeps and squawks that are interpreted as long-dead souls attempting to communicate. Why these voices are audible only to the sweet little old couple's tape recorder and not our ears is never explained, nor why any ""processing"" is necessary....although I think we all know why it is.

Please heed my warnings and avoid this turkey at all costs. It truly is just as bad as the critics said it was.....maybe even worse. You would be better off just listening to static....the plot is better and you will save a lot of time and money.",1123200000,2,2417,4.845036319612591

They don't get emotion through to you very well and you just wish they gave you more to like by the end of the film. The film also has a very ""pointless"" quality to it.

The story is pretty good, but there are some problems that the film seems to trip on.  I felt that Michael Keaton seemed to buy into this whole EVP idea just too quickly.  His character seemed to strike me as someone who was very grounded and rational.  I thought it would take A LOT to convince him that this whole idea was real.

I find the idea of communicating with the deceased through EVP messaging (white noise on tv/radio) interesting although I was too chicken to learn more about it on the special feature section. The scenery was beautiful and I loved the architecture of the modern homes where Johnathon (Michael Keaton) lived.

The man introduces himself as Raymond Price (Ian McNeice) and tells Jonathan that Anna contacted him from the other side. Jonathan gets irritated and ignores him, thinking the man is crazy. However, he receives a call from Anna's cell phone, and hears her voice on his machine, even though her cell phone is with him. Having changed his mind and now a believer, Jonathan goes back to Raymond, who introduces him to Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger), another person trying to contact the dead. Raymond tells Jonathan about E.V.P, Electronic Voice Phenomenon: a process by which the dead contact him through the static in television. He records them so that he can understand their messages more accurately. He puts a taping of Anna and Jonathan but Jonathan is unable to decipher the message. After a few days, Raymond is suddenly killed, the reason unknown. So now Jonathan buys a lot of equipment and is determined to find out what his wife was trying to convey him. But will he be able to stop the 3 strange figures that are watching his every move?

This movie tries to be a suspenseful thriller, and somewhat succeeds to a certain point. However, there are far too many things left unexplained after watching the movie, which makes you feel like you have just wasted your time. For example:

  -> Who are these creatures? Till the end scene, we do not find out who these three mysterious figures are or what their purpose is. Come on, being the integral components of the movie, don't you think we should at least know what they are called?

  -> Why were they after Anna? Towards the end (possible spoiler here), the guy says that they told him to get Anna. What did Anna do anyway? I mean, aren't those creatures supposed to come after those who meddle with contacting the dead? Anna was not doing any such thing, and even if she was, they should have mentioned it in the movie somewhere.

  -> And finally, WHO was that guy in the first place and why did the creatures ask him to do their dirty work?

This movie could have been much better, had they just made it a better ending. Its one thing for a movie to leave the audience in suspense at the end (like `The Blair Witch Project'), but it's another thing not to give the audience any clue whatsoever as to what is going on!

Anyway, coming to the cast and crew, director Geoffrey Sax did a good job in directing this movie. I mean, considering the writers for this movie went haywire towards the end, Sax maintained the suspense of the movie. The cast including Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger did adequately for their roles. This DVD has the usual special features such as documentaries, deleted scenes etc. to keep you entertained in the study of E.V.P.

In conclusion, from some of the reviews that I have read here, people who are into E.V.P do not appreciate this movie because of some faults, and general horror/thriller fans like me will find this movie disappointing because of its weak ending. So, if you are really keen on watching this movie because you are a Keaton fan or something, I would suggest renting it before actually buying it.",1122163200,,3803,4.54093567251462

wife and is approached by a guy claiming

this is wife has a ""message for him"" and

Keaton is a non believer at first, but later

decides to pursue the possibility that he

can come in contact with his wife.

Could have been a great idea but the character

development is mediocre front the start and

that continues throughout the move. How are we

supposed to feel anything for this family when

we have only seen them for 10 minutes? Also,

Michael doesnt seem to deeply care that is wife

is dead and seemingly starts to just go about

his business until he is approached by the guy

that informs him about his wife.

After small progress is made in contacting MK's

wife the old man just dies. How does he die? Is

he killed by the three 3 demons? Heart attack?

What?

*spoiler*

The way I see the rest of the movie is that

Michael Keatons wife leads him on a wild goose

chase saving people and going to the road to

catch the culpit... Which he does, but he dies

in the process and visits his wife and the

one who killed her was shot by police...

Basically, Anna gets her husband back and

her killer gets killed. The killer is the

average hard working guy that decides to

kill people that are better off than him

and he uses the technique of reaching

evil sprits to help him get the job done.

Basically, he uses the evil sprits as an

excuse for him to commit his brutal acts.

It really doesn't matter if they live or die.  What's the movie all about?  I watched it and I'm still not sure I know.  All that is important is to know that THEY are out there . . . and they are TRYING TO GET YOU!  The movie is your first initiation to their real plans.

The director does an excellent job of making you jump.  As the noise becomes quieter and quieter the words become more and more garbled the screen becomes darker and darker, until finally it is just you, mesmerized by the snowy picture of an old black and white TV screen.  All you hear is static.  THEN it happens.  I don't know what it is, but it is loud and makes you jump.  And it happens often.  I wasn't frightened at all by the film but found myself startled and jumping more than at any film I have viewed in recent years.  I almost got grumpy with the director because I felt I was being ambushed by light/sound tricks to make me jump.  When the film is finally over one sentence is displayed on a black screen.  I won't reveal what the sentence is, but it ties the film with the real world.  The next time the lights flicker, your first thought will be, ""White noise.""

EVP's is not something made up, not a myth or scam, scientists, paranormal investigators have put recorders into empty deserted ""haunted locations"" where people have died, and then listened to it later to discover faint voices and words, not talking like we know it but sound waves, and energy, in which the dead, can contact through. I know there are many believers and non believers but i've seen the show GHOST-HUNTERS, and these guys are sorta like the real ghost busters but they are very skeptical and look for hard evidence, they basically go to disprove, not to jump to any conclusions of a haunting. Butt i've seen things on that show that gave me the creeps including strange evps of children, and a man's voice saying WE'RE NOT DEAD. Ths skeptics would say it's all fake but it's not. They get calls from people who experience phenominon and they go to investigate and the scariest episode was when they went to an old 18th century prison, where on the screen up in block 12, a grim reaper looking phantom appeared floating and then disappeared. It had a black cape, and a stick and it was only appeared for 3 seconds but it was the scariest thing i'd ever seen, and they said that was the only thing they ever captured on camera that would be actual evidence. I'm even a person that doesnt believe alot of things that people make up just for attention, but this was real. So back to the movie, this movie is not what evp's do, it waas obviously sensationalized and fictional, and it wasn't that good because it turned out to be something completely different. This movie is a joke when it comes to evp's. I use to be in a ghost hunting group and i am really into this stuff because it's fun and at like 3 in the morning we'd visit haunted locations and we were extremely lucky to be some of the very few to experience real phenonminon. We were relaxed, and open to the energy and we weren't trippin out, and we have pictures of a phantom and it has a face and the body is wavy and all glowing, and a second one in the background. We sent it to a famous paranormal investigator, and we never heard from him maybe he stole it and made money off it, but his books have real aparition photos, and stories of hauntings. But it's not like the movies where you see ghosts as people floating in allyways and sh*t. Any murder or suicide that occurs the place will have that bad energy, and even lost souls can still linger if they believe they still have unfinished business, and suicdes don't mean a happy afterlife either.

However, all is turned upside down when Anna dies in a car wreck.  Shortly after her death, Keaton meets a man who claims to have heard from Anna beyond the grave through EVP - electronic voice phenomenon.  Essentially, the man scans recordings made of white noise, and he claims to hear messages from dead people.  Before long, Keaton is a believer and begins hearing similar voices.  Are they truly messages or something more sinister?

""White Noise"" has some positive aspects - the cinematography and lighting are quite good.  Of course, seeing Michael Keaton in a starring role is also always terrific, as he's been reduced mainly to supporting roles.  However, ""White Noise"" is just not a very good movie.  The plot is terribly convoluted with some gaping plot holes, particularly the fate of Keaton's female pal, Sarah Tate.  The tone of the movie is uneven - at times it aims for a serious paranormal flick and then veers to a more traditional horror movie.  In the end, though, it's just not scary or creepy.

1521607,1,B00005JNNT,"I viewed ""White Noise"" on DVD, which was probably a mistake because the disc's ""Bonus Features"" completely destroyed whatever shred of believability the movie had created...but more about that in a moment.

  The essential plot, the notion that the dead can and do communicate through electronic media, is catchy.  The problem is that the screenwriters never settle on precisely what they want to do with the idea.  In the opening message, Thomas Edison is quoted on the notion of electronically recording communications from the dead.  So we go in with at least the idea that all this might be within the realm of the possible.  Thus, when Michael Keaton's character hears the first contact from his dead wife, amid all the static the viewer's reaction is, ""OK...I'll buy that.""

  But then ""other"" spirits begin to appear and they're apparently not so nice.  ""OK,"" you say, ""I'll but into that too.""  Keaton is even warned by a spiritualist (who claims YEARS of ""training"" as the authority she has to muck with the dead.  Exactly where DOES one ""train"" for this sort of thing?  Is there a diploma involved?)that he is messing with forces he does not understand.  We even get to see these spirits...sort of an Unholy Trinity.  The first time we see them, they're creepy.  By the fifth time you see them, they evoke the Ghostly Trio who used to co-star in Casper comic books.  By the end, I took to calling them Moe, Larry and Curly.  Completely overdone, they completely lose their effect.

  Meanwhile, thing really go off track when these nasty spirits ""apparently"" kill one of Keaton's friends, somehow ""apparently"" cause another to jump off a balcony, and then ""apparently"" trash Keaton's home.  Who are these spooks? Why do they do these things?  HOW do they do these things? We're never told.

  Worse yet, Keaton now seems to be getting messages NOT from the dead, but from the about-to-be-dead.  Whoa!  This is a different movie entirely.  Now it is about Keaton saving people from certain doom.  Normal people might run in the opposite direction, but Keaton has been Batman, so he boldly goes where the rest of us wouldn't.

  Coming about 2/3 into the movie, an abduction sets up the ending and Keaton's last mission to save a victim.  Sadly, the wrap-up of the film is an absolute mess, with several different plot threads and notions all tossed together in a completely incoherent mish-mash. While the viewer is busy screaming ""Wait a minute,"", the film ends with the information that thousands of people record these messages, but that 1 in 12 of the messages is of a threatening nature.  ""OK,"" you think.  ""NOT a well done movie, but something creepy to think about. (Keaton is excellent, by the way, even if the material is weak)

  It was at this point that the DVD's bonus features ruined everything.  The DVD contains three small features...a ""documentary"" about Electronic Voice Phenomenon, or EVP, (recording the dead), a set of interviews with people who actually spend their time (and money) doing this, AND a nifty little bit on recording the dead in your hown home!  Hey, how about that for a great idea?  The problem is that these people are pathetic and laughable.  They are EXACTLY the sort of day-time TV addict, Wal-Mart refugees you'd EXPECT to be into this sort of stuff....ESPECIALLY when you learn that they all seem to have lost a child.  Hello?  Can anyone here spell I-M-A-G-I-N-A-T-I-O-N  R-U-N  W-I-L-D??

  In the end, the movie tries hard to get us to believe in an essentially unbelievable concept...and then the bonus features tell us to forget the whole thing because it is all nonsense and its adherents are all nuts who really need to get a life.",1120003200,2,3692,4.8086124401913874
1521608,4,B00005JNNT,"I had really wanted to see this movie in the theater when it came out because I am fascinated by how humans react to and cope with death, though I am not really into EVP. I didn't see ""White Noise"" because it was so soundly trashed by the critics. Fortunately there was a ""recommended"" sign at the rental store, and I trust the people there, so I rented the DVD.

  I liked the movie so much I am on my second viewing, this time with the commentary, which I *never* do. Of the ""mainstream"" reviews (newspapers, magazines) I read before and after seeing the movie, as well as ""user"" comments, I definitely get the impression that the writers want nothing to do with the subject of death, and thus they probably didn't watch the movie with an open mind, assuming they even bothered to watch it carefully. That's tragic - they can rant and rave over Keaton in ""Batman,"" but when he's in a movie with a far more meaningful and sensitive topic (in my opinion), it's no good, and I am convinced it's because of the movie's subject. Yes, it's really a shame that a movie which covers a complex issue like death and trying to communicate with the other side through mechanical means is dismissed so unfairly. And to make comparisons between this book and the best-selling novel ""White Noise,"" as was done by the NYTimes reviewer, is simply beyond belief and shows a staggering amount of ignorance.

  ""White Noise"" is a ""horror"" movie. People die in tragic, unfair circumstances (let's not get into ""karma"" here, and the movie doesn't get into karma either). Lives are ruined, and yet there is some salvation in attempting to communicate with the deceased, even through EVP machines and techniques. In ""White Noise"" there are great though obviously eerie successes using EVP, and I found the elaborate and complex arrays of machines depicted to be quite believable and realistic, and for those who are interested in trying EVP the DVD has extras which provide very basic and simple techniques for doing EVP.

  Without giving the plot away, the reader of this review probably knows at least that someone close to Keaton's character (his wife) dies. After some time and through some believable and well-done scenes, he becomes very (obsessively) interested in communicating with his wife using EVP. To show another aspect of the subject, the movie has a scene where he goes to a (blind) psychic who demonstrates ""non-mechanical"" communication with the other side and is strongly opposed to EVP, but Keaton's character persists.

  Further to the movie-makers credit, ""White Noise"" goes far beyond its basic theme of communicating with the dead through EVP. After Keaton begins communicating with his wife, she unexpectedly provides him with information that helps him aid people in this world. And yet this ""positive"" side of the movie is again done with subtlety and complexity, showing that even a beneficent twist to the horror has a down side precisely because of the overall macabre death theme.

  I find these plot complexities quite pleasing, and I disagree with those who want to know exactly what the movie is trying to present, exactly what the plot is in every scene. I like movies that make us think, ponder, and consider different possibilities, and for that reason I would give the script writer an A, easily. Add to that mostly excellent, realistic performances, on great Vancouver sets, and you have a fine movie, with the caveat that you have to have some interest in (and not be too fearful of) the topic of death and after-life communication.",1119744000,3,3553,4.830313014827018
1521609,5,B00005JNNT,"I think a lot of movie-goers prematurely set themselves up for dissapointment if they already have a strong opinion against EVP.  EVP goes back many years, with researchers like George Meek and his 'Spiricom' project supposedly having proved the existence of mysterious electronic voices 'from beyond' (do an online search with the words 'George Meek' and 'Spiricom').  Meek was a Pennsylvania engineer and Ham Radio operator, well respected in his field, who has documented these EVP voices before the current EVP craze hit.  His 'Spiricom' project consisted of obtaining EVP voices with all kinds of tape and radio equipment including experimenting with oscillators and beat frequencies.  There was an excellent non-fiction book on the subject titled 'The Ghost of 28 Megacycles' that described Meek and his experiments.  If you can find a copy, it is HIGHLY recommended reading.  You won't be able to put the book down!  In any case, 'White Noise' is well acted, has a good plot, and a healthy mix of very tense and/or scary moments, all made ever the more scarier if you believe in EVP.  Of course Hollywood embellishes some of the EVP scenes a bit, but this only adds to the wow factor of what EVP could actually be like.  This well made film asks the viewer to suspend any disbelief, and it works.  You will be drawn into the plot, and the ending is very good.

1521612,4,B00005JNNT,"Influenced a bit by The Sixth Sense, I found I enjoyed White Noise much more than the critics did you generally gave it poor reviews.  It's a subtle horror film.  A far cry from the more in your face shock value of many which may be one reason critics didn't like it.  Micheal Keaton plays a subdued Johnathan Rivers whose wife Anna, a famous author, disappears one day.  After several weeks, her body turns up in a river, where she apparently fell in an accident.

Soon Jonathan finds himself by Raymond Price who claims to have received messages from Anna.  Jonathan thinks he's a crackpot until he starts receiving calls from Anna's cell phone which has been turned off and messages in her voice on his answering machine.  He visits price and learns he's an expert in EVP, electronic voice phenomena, and is able to record the sounds and sights of the dead.  Price has catalogued literally hundreds of tapes for different people, essentially using his skills as therapy for the loved ones of the deceased.  Jonathan becomes a believer after hearing his voice himself.  Price warns however that not all spirits are good and we see quick flashes of three shadowy figures on the TV screen and hear some threatening messages.  Price is soon found dead under mysterious circumstances and his equipment destroyed.

Jonathan sets up his own monitors, recorders, and computer to begin trying to record the messages himself and soon is getting messages from his wife and from other people.  But in a twist, he is receiving messages from people before they are dead and is able to use that knowledge to help save people.  At this point I found it to be an exceptional film.  Suspenseful atmosphere that really piqued my interest.  Just who were those three shadowy figures and why is Jonathan able to get clairvoyant messages?

The last quarter of the movie just unfolds a bit too fast and a lot of the questions are left unanswered such as those evil, shadowy ghosts.  I won't spoil the final little plot twist but that was all a bit too trite for me an took a bit of the luster off an otherwise very fine film.  I enjoyed Keaton in a more sedate performance.  As he is in nearly every seen he really had to give a strong performance and I think he did.

The DVD includes a few short featurettes on real EVP experts as well as some deleted scenes and commentary.  Good film but lost a bit at the end.",1119225600,,2394,4.570422535211268

Michael Keaton (Jonathan Rivers)

Chandra West (Anna Rivers)

Deboarh Kara Unger (Sarah Tate)

DVD Release: May 17, 2005

PG-13

As an avid fan of horror, suspense and thriller movies, I have to say that White Noise falls short of recent box office hits like The Ring, The Sixth Sense and even The Grudge (which I found to be horribly boring). This movie had the potential to make one hell of a summer blockbuster thriller, but unfortunately, will never be donned with that title.

White Noise follows the life and grief of it's main character Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) after his wife has passed away. The beginning of the movie is basically of no use to it's audience, as if you've seen the previews, you knew that the wife was toast from the get-go. The first 20 minutes of the movie are useless, and could be trimmed up to expand the ending. The first act gives us a regular family, dealing with everyday problems with a ""someone's about to be slaughtered"" soundtrack. A good bit of foreshadowing shows us the wife is about to be missing from the picture.

After his wife passes, Jonathan begins to receive electronic voice messages from her. The storyline that continues through the end of the first act and the second act have extreme potential to give us a excellent, nay, amazing ending. However, Keaton is an actor of facial expressions, and you find yourself knowing exactly what is about to happen just be the look on his face. The middle of the movie is probably the best. The filming and acting here were excellent, there was a sense of thrill and suspense as Jonathan learns more about EVP (eletronic voice phenomona) and has to deal with figuring out what exactly he's seeing, while attempting to not go bonkers himself. We watch Jonathan view multiple TV screens full of static, while his son watches cartoons in the other room. By now your wondering how in the world does watch so much static and not go crazy? This thought will be followed up by the movie's best foreshadowing line: son: ""Daddy, are you going to be okay?"".

I won't include any spoilers here, but I will say that the movie does not in any way tie itself together at the end. Throughout the movie you have a very effective set-up of only quick glimpses of ""the bad guys"" and small references to them (pay attention when Jonathan and his friend with the same issues, Sarah are talking in her bookstore). The ""bad guys"" are pathetically explained in the end, as is the plot. Unfortunately, the movie may make sense to the writer, but he forgot to explain it to us. I found myself thinking about 3/4 of the way through that ""The only thing that would make this a bad movie is if everything doesn't tie up at the end"".

Filming of the movie, aside of the ""ghosts"", was decent. There has been better, but there has been far worse. There are filmed scenes that will make you jump (one namely, when Jonathan has his ear up to the TV the first time he sees his wife), but not enough to make this a good thriller. Digital photography and computer editing of pictures is extremely easy today, at that is mainly what you're looking at the entire movie.

Acting:: there are two main characters in the movie: Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) and his friend Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger). Of the two, I find Sarah more of a well-played character. Michael Keaton is not mysterious, and as referenced earlier, gives alot of the story away before it's meant to be given away with facial expressions.

EVP is an actual process documented back to the 1920's, and the extra footage on the DVD shows us two professional paranormal investigators and their journey through two locations and recording EVP. Unfortunately, they also give you the bare bones of how to record EVP yourself. I dare say this slightly made a joke out of the whole process (imagine thousands of people who've seen the movie sitting at home trying hard not to breathe into their tape recorders as they listen for ghost voices).

In all, I rate the movie with a C. It had potential, much potential - it just chose to go the other route instead.

Effect - you may find yourself listening more closely to static from now on.",1119225600,,4177,4.604306864064603

""White Noise"" is not revolutionary, but if you've enjoyed the previous two mentioned above, and also ""Gothika"" and ""Signs"" -well, here's you cup of tea. A friend of mine said that the movie wasn't boring, but that it wasn't scary. My response now is; Not scary? Were you asleep or what? Though not the scariest movie I've ever seen, I sat tightened to my seat.

Not much more to say than; Enjoy ""White Noise""!",1119225600,2,615,4.6422018348623855
1521655,1,B00005JNNT,"I won't bother with writing a large essay as to what the movie is about, I am sure that by now you've either seen it or talked about it to others so I don't have to go into saying why the characters do what they do.  If you haven't watched the movie, the main character Rivers uses EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) to speak and interact with his late wife.  Fancy name to necromancy, speaking to the dead, but now is ""hiphop"" in flavor to such an extent that I have coworkers in my job who now (after watching the movie) go out to old grave yards and old houses to speak to the dead using recording devices.  And they too have had their show of scares, not surprisingly.

This is an important movie and it is important but not for the reasons why the writers and directors thought it would be.  First and foremost it shows just how dangerous it is to involve oneself in the occult, going to mediums going to seances studying tarot practicing witchcraft.  As with the main character, Jonathan Rivers, the occult sucks you into its labyrinth, ghosts or ""loved ones"" from the other side are truly demons that seek to hurt, seek to undermine, seek to warp one's point of view.  The main character, as he tries to practice a 21st century form of necromancy, finds himself losing grounds with reality, with his son, with those around him.  The more he wants to explore and see his late wife through electrical devices, and the more he seems to be sent out to find those who need help (guided by the white noise of EVP), the more he finds hell in the shadows of reality.  Occult desire to speak to his wife turns into an obvious addiction to using computers and wires and electricity to speak to the dead, all the while the demonic shadows grow closer and closer to the obvious ending.

I know from my own experiences in the occult, practicing witchcraft until being saved to Christ, one is easily duped into a dangerous world of spirits of the like that Jonathan Rivers meets...only in real life, they really are demons not goddesses or loved ones or spirit guides.  Demons like exactly both sides of the coin, both with what Jonathan Rivers was doing and what the killer was doing--more involved in the darkness, the more the darkness swallows you up until the end.  Unlike Hollywood, you aren't dealing with helpful, benign beings, you are dealing with creatures of Satan himself.",1119139200,2,2377,4.540983606557377

I don't know what everybody had a problem with, but it was a terrific ghost story. It was creepy when it needed to be and left me with chills, I personally don't believe in EVP but my husband does and he found this movie right up his alley.

They are rarely seen, except in a few pretty cool looking scenes on a snowy TV screen, the writer or director really should of developed those characters better. ""What where they?"" For one thing. Ok, so the killer at the end kidnaps women and tortures them for the delight of the three ghosts? Yet, they personally do bodily harm to the main character at the end of the film? So, if they have the capability of doing bodily harm on their own, what was the point of the killer who does the kidnapping for them. It just did not tie together well at all, having this crazed killer going around kidnapping and killing people (because the three ghosts need him to?), and also the three ghosts going around messing up peoples rooms and also killing people. Then we have the main character who finds a way to save people from being almost killed, which he sort of does on two or three occasions. The funny thing is the police never suspect him of being the killer. His wife is killed, lady in a car dies, but he does save her baby and then a lady, he just met, jumps off a balcony. I think their would be a tad bit of suspicion on the guy. Also, the detective character goes nowhere. This movie had potential, but totally blew it.

1521658,1,B00005JNNT,"That noise you hear isn't white noise. It's that terrible zzzzzz noise from sleeping movie watchers who couldn't keep their eyes open. This is another attempt to bring ""maturity"" and ""artistry"" to the fantasy/horror genre but it fails miserably. It's impossible to feel any fright or tension from the tepid screenplay. Michael Keaton is shown in endless scenes as he tries to communicate with his dead wife. You watch him staring bug-eyed at the monitor filled with static. And then somehow, he's convinced he's made contact with his wife in the great beyond. Oh, yeah, he does have a son, but you wonder how the kid survives because he rarely sees his father. There appears to be a genuine psychic phenomena known as 'white noise'--where voices from dead people have been received via monitors. If so, then this movie needs to be remade with a much better script and a lot more genuine scares than this mess conjured up.",1118707200,,921,4.79874213836478
1521659,2,B00005JNNT,"If you had to search for the single thing that could make a horror movie bad, you might pick dumbness or perhaps lack of scariness.  To me, there is an even more fundamental issue, and that's tedium.  While White Noise is not all that brightly written or overly creepy, the biggest problem with the movie is it's generally boring.

The story deals with a concept called EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomena.  EVP occurs through the static of the radio or TV, where apparently the dead can send messages if you listen hard enough.  Michael Keaton plays a recent widower who starts listening after his wife dies.  It soon becomes an obsession and he neglects his son and his work as he tries to get a message from his dead wife.  Even when he starts running into sinister otherwordly forces, he is not deterred, especially as he realizes that the messages actually predict future events.

This movie is an obvious cross between The Sixth Sense and The Ring, but it seems that the crossbreeding of these two films produced something that is basically lifeless.  The fault seems to lie with the direction, which paces the story rather slowly.  Michael Keaton is competent but bland, and in fact, there are few very interesting characters or situations.  In the end, there is nothing gratingly bad about this movie, but it's overall mediocrity rates it at best two stars.",1118534400,,1363,4.757446808510639
1521660,2,B00005JNNT,"Look, want a full review of this flick, look at the Spotlight Reviews earlier here, but I'm not going to talk about that. But what I am going to talk about is what the whole movie was based upon, and how Hollywood got it wrong....so very wrong.

EVP, electronic voice phenomenon, is a techinque used to record voices that's origin truly cannot be explained other than from another realm (that's a safe way of explaining it). However, this ACTUALLY DOES EXIST & IS REAL! But not like how the movie shows it.

First off, when they show the audio recordings happening, that's pretty accurate, that's how they're done and pretty much sound (be it not so long and not that clear). But the stuff with the TV or electronic objects just turning on by themselves or clocks stopping or cell phones just ringing with a phone call from the dead, no that just doesn't happen, they added that for the movie (Ugh!). And what's up with the ""ghosts"" appearing, killing anyone that gets into their path? That's not what EVP's are all about (or even capable of), why turn this into another ""Poltergeist"", when this actually occurs and is real with proof to boot?!!? Why make a movie, the FIRST movie EVER to even mention the case of EVP's like this, so audience members can think it doesn't actually happen & it's just another movie story. As a believer, and someone who actually has expierenced EVP's first hand, I was insulted by how the story was beefed up with so much Hollywood fiction just to sell a few more tickets (which it didn't), instead of making a movie that could present this phenomena in a true, more realistic & believable light.

Don't believe me? Put it in Google, listen to the THOUSANDS of recorded sound bites of EVP's presented on-line, and judge for yourself. Trust me, they all can't be fake, and there's just too much proof for it all to be a hoax (I mean hey, they did make a whole movie about it, right? Just the wrong movie.).

But the DVD does have some merit though. Included are three extras with real life EVP experts that show you the true study of this, with actual recorded EVP's and techniques on how to do so. Then you TRULY can see the difference between writing stuff about a true phenomena & creating a movie version of it. I mean, at the end of the movie it says most EVP's are aggresive in nature, then in the extras the experts claims most are not. Why didn't the movie's writers catch that one, huh? Did the experts ever mention that EVP's also contain ""visions"" or ""ghosts"" accompaning them? No, they didn't, but the movie writers appearently know more than they do (sure...). I'd say most believers, like myself, were truly insulted when they finally saw this film. And if you ever expierenced this, you'd feel the same way.

Okay, okay. You want to see a real life ghost related to EVP's appear on your TV? Okay, explain this one then: Go to the Special Features section, chose the third choice ""Hearing Is Believing"", go exactly 9 minutes & 5 seconds into it, and look in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. What in the world is that circular object floating by the expert's head?!!? Could that be a ""ghost"" captured on screen at a time when it might have also been recorded as an audio EVP? Who knows, judge that bit for yourself I guess.

To sum up, this one's a definite rental, and mostly for the three extra documentaries alone, not for the joke of a movie that got them a DVD to begin with. Electronic Voice Phenomenon is a proven fact, and for the first movie ever to bring it so much in the public's view, to be treated like a horror movie version of Demi Moore's ""Ghost"" was just insulting.

So let me leave you with some humor: Throughout watching this movie, rolling my eyes at how far removed the facts were from the fiction, seeing the typical British buddy buying it by the second act, the famous wife buying it in the first, and Michael Keaton trying to hold it all together, I kept saying the same thing to myself: ""I can't believe this guy used to be Batman"".",1118534400,,4015,4.476775956284153
1521661,1,B00005JNNT,"This film was a massive disappointment.  From both an entertaining aspect and the storytelling aspect, it just never really got off the ground.  There were too many elements that went untouched that should have either been explained or explored.  Instead, we are forced through a film without any directions and a horrible guide.  I personally got lost twice trying to find my way out of there.  There was some potential in White Noise, but sadly it never was shown the light of day.  The concept behind the film is absurd.  The ability to hear the dead through your computer or VCR seemed a bit archaic to me.  This was a very modern film, yet we are forced to possibly see the spirits through BETA ... I kept waiting for that important scene to switch this entire film around.  Alas, it never evolved.  So, instead, I am forced to watch Michael Keaton fumble his way through an already pathetic film and experience some of the least frightening (mostly due to do underdevelopment) ghosts that the horror genre had to offer.  I would rank these below Casper ... and he was a friendly ghost.

The issue arrives very early into the film.  We are shown brief images of these three shadows that constantly had me thinking of the ""Smoking Man"" in X-Files.  Who were these spirits?  Why were they just watching?  What were they doing on television?  Simple questions that you would think would be answered immediately throughout the film (because they are a big element to the ending), but no, nothing is explained.  These three shadows are used as a technique early in the film to make audiences jump in their seats while never quite explaining who or what they are.  Then, as if we are to already know what they are, they are used near the end for a very important scene.  This left me boggled.  In fact, the entire ending left me boggled.  I am not going into detail here because others would be upset, but the entire ending seemed that director Geoffrey Sax wanted to incorporate several different techniques from several different styles of film into one unclimactic ending.  It was poorly executed and very badly conceived.  It will not end with a great taste in your mouth.

So, with the choppy spiritual aspect and the abruptly bad ending, I bet you are thinking that at least Keaton could carry this film.  Wrong.  This seemed like it was the most difficult film for Keaton to handle.  I am not sure if it was the emotional moments that didn't settle well with him or if it was the fact that he had to use expression on his face instead of reading his lines that ruined his performance here, but either way he was disastrous.  From the opening scene of this film, you never really saw Keaton as anyone other than Michael Keaton.  The moments between he and his wife seemed forced and rather Hollywood created, which overall impacted the rest of the film for me.  Why would this man want to hear his wife if he wasn't really in love with her?  Bring that element into the picture and I think Sax would have had a stronger picture.  Secondly, does anyone else get tired of witnessing grown men never go to work yet have the most lavish lifestyle?  As a retail working man, I thought this completely ruined any reality that this film was trying to build.  A man who wishes to live a trendy lifestyle needs to work, and Keaton (after about the first ten minutes of this film) never went back to work.  To me, that was depressing and unbelievable.

Keaton did not cut it at all in this film, but then again, neither did his co-stars.  The choice to use Deborah Kara Unger was smart, but we needed to give more to her.  She is a spooky woman that almost carried The Game away from Michael Douglas, but somehow was completely forgotten about throughout this film.  I understand that Keaton was supposed to be the central focus, but she was a huge element in helping him understand EVP, so why not give her more screen time.  Then there was Ian McNeice, who quite possibly wasted his talent on this film.  He is a decent actor that showed us that bad screenwriting can still sound bad from the mouth of even decent actors.  Nobody in this film seemed to have the energy or excitement that was needed to make this film worth watching again, and again, and again.

Finally, the story was as shallow as the local kiddy pool.  Director Sax had us jumping from one moment to the next, confusing even the most novice of film watchers and horror enthusiasts.  You could tell that he had so much information, so many ideas, that he wanted to get out on the screen that he dropped some crucial elements and completely forgot about some other ones.  Finally, when we do get to the ending, we are so turned around and unexcited that laughter seems the only response one could give.  For this story to work stronger there was a need for better actors, a tighter script, and more development of those three shadows that still have me scratching my head.  Just like in the X-Files none of my questions were answered.

I was surprised at how well the entire story was crafted; how well it all played together.  It certainly provided some genuine scares for us, while not using the usual cheap thrills and gore that is often served up in this genre.  This film about loss and grieving, about wanting that last chance to hear from a loved one, is really very sad.  I felt so so sorry for the protagonist's little boy -- who certainly got short shrift in the story.  I did, also, feel that the very last scene was unnecessary.

1521696,3,B00005JNNT,"The premise for this movie is intriguing and has tons of potential: that the dead attempt to contact the living through air and sound waves. Given the interest in quantum physics generated by films like What the Bleep, that suggest that our seemingly physical universe is a really composed of energy waves, White Noise is seems like an interesting ""what if"" of this theory.

I genuinely enjoyed watching this film for several reasons: first, as mentioned in other reviews, Geoffrey Sax directs the film with enough restraint to maintain a level of edge of chair suspense (there are several gotcha moments in the film and I jumped at most of them) but still keeps the movie on pace. Michael Keaton was terrific and entirely believable as the lead character walking the line between shock, grief, and later, an obsession with communicating with his wife in an effort to find meaning in her death. The supporting characters, many of whom are local to the Vancouver area, contributed solid performances that added to the movie as a whole.

The sets and production as a whole were perfect. At the beginning of the film the lighting is bright and sunny underscoring the lead character's ""perfect"" life. Following the wife's death, the lighting and mood gradually darken as more scenes occur at night and during thunder storms.

The reason I only gave White Noise three stars was because of the questions it raised without providing satisfying answers. Alhough I'm skeptical of the basic premise of the dead haunting our airwaves, I was was game enough to suspend my disbelief in order to enjoy the film. The problem lies more in the number of loose ends that don't really come together and probably could have without too many changes.

The story suggests that along with benevolent spirits who want to reassure the living, there are malicious spirits that want to manipulate the living into acts of violence from which they derive some sort of vicarious pleasure. But I wanted to understand who these malevolent spirits were. Where did they come from? At the end did any of the characters learn something?

Spoilers here:

Some loose ends that bug me were

1. It isn't entirely clear how Anna Rivers died: at the end it's suggested that she was a victim of the evil spirit directed serial killer but that remains ambigous.

2. Why does Sarah attempt suicide? Again, it's suggested that it was the evil spirits but that's not really explained

3. When John is fighting the evil spirits, Sarah goes into convulsions at the hospital. Again, it's not clear why.

4. Who or what killed Raymond?

5. How does the situation when John saves the infant figure into the plot other than as a device to a. provide a red herring that his wife wants him to intervene (instead of warning him) b. to provide a way to connect the seemingly random characters

Bottom line: the strength of direction, acting, and the stylish production is enough to make this this a very enjoyable and spooky film. However, the weak and ambigous ending left me wanting more closure.",1117929600,,3041,4.804597701149425

Running Time:  98 minutes.

Rated PG-13 for some intense situations and some language.

""White Noise"" is another twenty-first century thriller that is founded on a very intriguing idea, but falls apart at the stitches due to a fragmented storyline, an unwavering indecision to either be a supernatural thriller or a serial killer mystery, and only lackluster performances from its stars.  The film begins with an overview of the loving marriage between architect Jonathan (played by a bland Michael Keaton) and best-selling author Anna Rivers (Chandra West).  On one unfortunate night, Anna's vehicle is found empty on the side of a ridge and she is pronounced missing.  Not wanting to give up hope for his wife's survival, Jonathan insists that she is still alive until an odd stranger (Ian McNeice) informs him that his wife is dead-and he's been speaking to her.

Jonathan learns about Electric Voice Phenomenon (EVP), which allows the dead to communicate with those who are still alive via the static of television, radio, and other electronic devices.  As Jonathan becomes more obsessed with the eccentric episodes within the next beyond, he realizes that his deceased wife is not only talking to him, but that she is directing him in ways that may save others.  With the help from fellow EVP enthusiast (Deborah Kara Unger), Jonathan makes it his personal endeavor to save the life of a missing woman who may or may not be dead.  As ""White Noise"" unfolds, director Geoffrey Sax and screenwriter Niall Johnson seem more content on providing atmospheric situations that make the audience jump instead of completing a cohesive thriller that actually makes sense.  There are many baffling questions that are not answered (why Jonathan receives these specific messages from the dead right at 2:30 a.m.; who are the three mysterious figures that continuously pop up on video surveillance, for example) and the creation of a sincere conflict between character and the ""other world"" is not tangible.  ""White Noise"" could have (and should have) been an incredibly terrifying look into a phenomenon that is becoming ever so more real with unremitting research, but instead the film deludes the audience by unraveling into a ridiculous horror farce just like all the others of its kind.",1117843200,6,2419,5.164102564102564

In White Noise, the latest Hollywood dead wife reclamation project (Dragonfly, Mothman Prophecies), Michael Keaton stars as Jonathan Rivers, an architect with an angelic, internationally renowned author wife; a cute, pre-precocious five-year-old son; and a seemingly plastic, picture-perfect life.

Since White Noise is a horror-thriller, it's only a matter of time before Rivers's world comes crashing down, but not until writer Niall Johnson and director Geoffrey Sax hammer home how much the man with a plan has to lose. I guess they were hoping that a bigger set-up would provide for a bigger emotional payoff, but anyone with a ticket tucked in their pocket knows better. Unless the family is real and engaging, like the para-normally challenged Freeling's from Poltergeist, all that set-up is a waste of time.

After offering us an extended portrait of the Rivers family, we are then treated to a rude awakening. Wife Anna (Chandra West) is missing. Time passes, days, and then weeks. Then more bad news. Her body is found. That leaves Jonathan and his son alone to put back the pieces of their shattered lives. They move away hoping to find some peace and serenity, but all Jonathan gets is static. Literally.

He thinks it's interference or power lines, but a stranger knows better. He tells Jonathan that the static, also known as White Noise, can be used by the dead to communicate with the living. Skeptical, Jonathan dismisses the stranger, until a series of events lead him to believe that his wife is trying to make a connection. Hope they have roaming charges, because my calling plan doesn't have a touch out and reach someone from beyond the dead option.

Pretty soon Jonathan is a believer in Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and obsessively invests in trying to contact his wife. That means reaching out to others who have experienced the same phenomenon, including bookstore owner Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger), who is in contact with her dead fianc. You can't blame her. It's the only time he's been stiff without Viagra.

Bad joke, bad movie, one that takes almost every cue from Poltergeist. Spirits communicating through the static on electronic appliances? Poltergeist. The protagonist ultimately realizing that the static also contains the presence of evil spirits? Poltergeist. When the filmmakers are done scrap mining Poltergeist, they turn White Noise into a paranormal detective story that feels like a different movie.

Keaton looks weary to the point of boredom, the rest of the cast react rather than act, while the filmmakers just keep shoving them back into the middle of a no-win boxing match.",1117584000,,2670,5.110091743119266
1521734,3,B00005JNNT,"Nobody is going to accuse the ghost story, or the communicating with a loved lost one, as being underused in Hollywood thrillers. Some hit the bullseye, and some miss the mark entirely. This one falls somewhere in between. Before I go on any further, let me just say that I have always been a big fan of Michael Keaton and I enjoyed this flick for the fact that he was in a a pretty big and popular film. He seems to disappear for a while and he isn't used as much as he sould be. With that being said, Keaton's return is justified by his humble performance of Jonathan Rivers. Rivers is an architect with a beautiful home on the water, a young son, and a beautiful wife named Anna(who just revealed a happy surprise to Jonathan). But his dream life is taken away from him in an instant when his wife goes missing and is later announced dead. Things in his life change even further when he is visited by a man named Raymond Price, who tells Rivers that he has come into contact with Anna from the ""other side' thru EVP. Known as Electric Voice Phenomena, EVP is a device that many paranormal experts use to communicate with the dead. Voices of the deceased come thru in the snow on your TV or phone, or radio. EVP swallows up Jonathan's existence and he is soon on a neverending quest to hear something from Anna. His new home quickly turning into an audio/video equipment showplace. But as in most thrillers of this nature, not everything is hunky dory. You meddle in death, and you stir up some bad mojo. Messing with the forces of nature. Soon, Jonathan is involved with eerie messages from the beyond on how to find and hopefully save people before they actually die. Plot secrets abound in the form of Anna's true demise, and who are these three strange shadows that appear whenever something bad is going to happen?. All is revealed in an ending that is just as confusing as it is predictable. Jonathan is helped along the way by Sarah(Deborah Kara Unger), a woman who just recently lost her fiancee, and who meets Jonathan while having her own EVP sessions with Price. The movie scores with the fact that it plays on fears, chills, and thrills, while downplaying the usual horror-ish movie standards. While a number of the scares, or ""Jumps"", will chill and even spook some, they still seem to be almost expected. Still, the mood is undeniably creepy and eerie in many places, and director Geoffrey Sax films many of the more chilling and tense moments with the right amount of restraint and straight forwardness that the type of scares it has. The movie's plot and own twists and turns seem to cave in on another as the film goes on, making the film seem to lose it's way before it gets to the big finish, but it delivers for what it is. It's not strikingly new or original, but it holds your interest for the most part and does have some good ""goosebump"" moments. Keaton is always nice to see, and he plays Jonathan as well as he could with the somewhat overwrought material. You pretty much watch every moment he's on screen, and since the cast is very limited, he's on screen pretty much every second. Unger really has nothing to do except to be the friend to lean on and to be there when something happens. Anyone could of done that role in their sleep. With it's flaws, sometimes confusing logic, and plot holes, White Noise can still entertain and deliver some real chills, but it won't stand a ghost of a chance to be included on any good 'ghost movie' list. And even tho Michael Keaton was in ""First Daughter"" with Katie Holmes, this one, and the upcoming ""Herbie"" movie, let's give him more meaty roles that he deserves.

I actually spent more time outside chatting with my friend than inside bothering with a film that continued to string you along and make you think it would lead to something. This movie leads you to a question mark (?) The real question most people might ask is why did i bother. Some movies are best to be seen only on tv and remember if you catch this on tv and are still curious about it be sure you take some valume or other sleeping pill. If a person was on drugs they'd see better images. Read the warning: THIS MOVIE HAS NO ENDING and sucks.,1117411200,2,667,4.022556390977444

Give or take a few touches of ""Don't look Now' and ""Ghost"" this spell-binding tale provides many a bump in the night - when shadows you usually take for granted as just that 'shadows' animate themselves with hostility towards humans, not to mention 'static' noise - ala 'Poltergeist'.

There's agreat deal to be said for all of this - and it IS best left alone, the departed have passed on - leave them alone lest the minor elementals [the 'heavies'] lock onto your vibe - then watch out if you're not prepared ...[some technicality with the akashic record and 'passing through'].

1521738,3,B00005JNNT,"Ghosts, UFO's and aliens, bigfoot and psychic abilities are always in that debatable category where some believe in it and others don't, despite evidence to the contrary but merely dismiss it. One such area has been steadily increasing in interest is EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomenon. In this, images or sounds from the afterlife appear or are heard on a detuned radio or on your tv static. So the film, unlike the Forgotten, gets you into a topic you wouldn't otherwise know of, but they just can't make a good film out of it in the end.

Jonathan Rivers is a re-married man whose living his wife Anna, who's a successful writer, who's also pregnant. One night she doesn't come home until he realizes she's missing. Sure enough, her car is found abandoned by the docks. She's found dead couple weeks later. A man approaches him and says that Anna's been communicating with him through EVP. Jonathan dismisses it until he starts to realize there might be something.

This draws him further and further into EVP until it literally consumes his life and becomes an obsession. The voices tell him to save people before they die, but there's 3 shadowed men that don't want anyone interfering. Helping him is Sarah, who lost her fiance.

The film is similar to any other recent horror movie which scares you by that silence then wham, big boom in the score. One example is when he is watching a normal TV static until a woman suddenly screams and appears on tv. Some of the scares seem a little obvious like when 3 apparitions appear in a room. The scene looks just completely green sceen looking.

The film has quite a lot of plot points and script problems that'll scratch your head. Like they say it takes quite awhile before you have your first EVP since it helps if you're in an area with history, yet he receives them like wildfire. In one sequence, the obligatory ""montage"" scene he gets nothing for a long time then he attracts them like Winnie the Pooh to honey.

The film is interesting on a topical level and it might make you jump several times but on an actual film basis, it's rather lacking.

Side note: I don't know if it was just my disc but I couldn't really rewind the film and it actually just fast forwarded and I couldn't stop it and had to turn it off(the disc or something else? Hm.)

1521739,4,B00005JNNT,"I enjoyed the film in the Theatre immensely. The DVD version is great, especially the clarity, and the BAM factor in the audio. I saw comments that noted so-called plot holes before seeing the movie, and I still do not see any of the so called plot holes mentioned in the editorial.
This film is well constructed, and done with an exactness and economy that is impressive. After listening to the commentary, its because the director is a BBC  alumni. The commentary is not advertised on the box at all, nor on any extras details that I am aware of. I would have given the film 5 stars if it were not for the fact that because of a DVD  production mess up, Keaton had to leave 15 minutes before the film's end for him to go on a holiday. Whilst the commentary is not the greatest, it does make the key point that this film was forced into a PG-13 rating by the makers of the film cutting some of the key scenes. The studios are getting way too much influence from the right wing Neo-Cons.
Anyways, the extras are great. The key thing about this film, is you will enjoy it, as Keaton notes, if you buy into the idea of EVP, well, if you have, then these extras will totally chill you !!! They are fun, and totally awesome. The audio on this film is well done, and in 5.1 all I can say is WOW... what a great watch, and a chilling listen ( good audio mix too).",1117238400,3,1357,4.175572519083969
1521740,4,B00005JNNT,"This film did what it was SUPPOSED to do...

  Regardless of what you thought of this film, or will think of this film, it does what it is ultimately supposed to do - make you aware of, and perhaps pique your curiosity about Electronic Voice Phenomenon.

  I've read what seems like hundreds of reviews here on Amazon.com and haven't seen a single comment on what was REALLY going on with the antogonist(s) here. Read other reviews for the plot and for story spoilers, then read the following and insert it into your thinking. The movie will NOT explain the following, but it helps if you know it.

  The film features, more and more as it wends it's way towards drama, an image of menace in the form of a trio of dark spirits. This trio of low spirits FEEDS on the pain and suffering and negative drama of our mortal existences. They go a step beyond feeding and begin CAUSING these empowering negative emotions by affecting the living (EVP researchers) and coercing them to do their sadistic bidding or else killing them as they did Raymond Price if their demands are refused. The more a person is tortured, afraid and just stressed out, the more negative energy they produce for these spirit low-lifes to consume.  This is a common basic premise for some cult activities - human sacrifices are pretty bland unless the sacrificee has been tortured and is in a state of utter panic, fear, dread and morbid disarray.  The more horrified and suffering the more tasty and nourishing the spiritual energy.

  This film could have been a complete freak out psychological horror fest had it focused on the trio and their successive attempts to affect more and more EVP enthusiasts into doing their evil bidding. A chilling scene would have been of our protagonist (Keaton) dying (at the hands of a 'darkly brainwashed' EVP enthusiast) as we managed to feel compassion for his plight, only to feed their evil hunger, and then either show directly, or allude to many, many more 'crazed, serial killers' seeking only the praise and increasing demands of the trio who are growing in power from their work.  Believing that there are legions of serial killers out there serving dark demons via White Noise manipulation, you'd hold your loved ones close at all times and check over your shoulder often if it was pulled off convincingly enough.

  But that's not what this movie was about. The movie was about EVP and yet Hollywood felt that we wouldn't swallow any bait (by spending our hard earned money) that was not glittery and dripping with dark drama and spell-it-out-for-you violence so we got what we got.  However, the film did do something it set out to do - it introduced the whole concept of EVP to untold numbers of people worldwide and in so doing has done it's true purpose. Like the movie or not, believe it or not, make sense of it or not, you are now acutely aware of Electronic Voice Phenomenon.  Consider it a nearly two hour infomercial on something you were not likely familiar with before.

  Everyone has different perceptions on everything. Some see being alone as a tragic loneliness, others see it as a wonderful time for meditation, self reflection and introspection. Some like rain, some hate it, etc.

  Watch the extra EVP materials on the White Noise DVD and whether you want to buy into it or not, just sit alone in a dark room by yourself, perhaps with the TV on to static and allow yourself to drift into a deep state of ""What if...""  If you manage to go there, decide THEN if the movie was a waste of your time or not. It opened my mind to consider these possibilities regardless of what I thought about the plot, story or actors.

  I say perceive the movie for yourself and make up your own mind.",1117065600,3,3722,4.621004566210046
1521761,2,B00005JNNT,"What do you get if you add one part Poltergeist, with one part The Sixth Sense?  Answer:  White Noise.  Michael Keaton stars in this less than stellar performance of a not so original story.

In the film Keaton plays Jonathan Rivers, a highly successful architect, married to Anna Rivers, a highly successful writer.  Jonathon plans to put his job on hiatus and join his wife on her new book tour for her soon-to-be release book.  However, upon the notice that his wife might be expecting, Anna fails returns home. After the abduction of his wife and her subsequent death, Jonathan becomes sullen and uncaring, distant and unaware of his surroundings until he becomes acquainted with Raymond Price (played by Ian McNeice).  Price has also lost someone very close to him, his son, almost 12 years prior.  However, Price receives messages, transmissions, and images from entities from the ""other"" side in the form of E.V.P.s (Electronic Voice Phenomena) or White Noise.  The problem is that not all the transmissions are from ""good"" spirits.

Jonathan gets totally absorbed into this medium, and starts receiving regular messages from his wife.  He quickly figures out that the transmissions that he's receiving are actually hints/clues to help him prevent impending death and disaster.  The problem is that the ""bad"" entities are using the same technique to produce death and disaster.

In film has a great premise, and a good beginning; however, it quickly spirals into the absurd, with a trio of evil spirits out to kill mankind.  I really believe the film could have been much better with a whole lots less going on.  The writers could not decide what story they wanted to tell, and therefore was unable to tell any story effectively.  The pinnacle of absurdity begins with Jonathan's wife making visual contact with him in a deserted warehouse, and culminates into what I can only describe as the hell demon sequence in Ghost.  I could not figure out what message the film was trying to get across to the audience.  What started out as a film about ""righting the wrong"" or telling love ones that you were okay, and start living your life again; turn into a film of ""talk to the dead, and die"" with both human and spiritual henchmen.

My advice would be to try another selection; there are much better films out there that are more scary or physiologically thrilling.  This film is neither.

This movie was so disappointing. I don't know why I even get excited over horror movies anymore because they always end up letting me down. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked freaky and was excited to see it. However after hearing bad reviews from both critics and people I know that saw it in theaters I began setting myself up for disappointment.

This film might have a few chills to offer the viewer, but once the film picks up the pace and things start coming together, it loses all balance and goes off the deep end and completely falls apart. The ending of this movie is so incredibly stupid and maddening that you will wonder why you wasted your time watching it. And so I would warn you to skip this generic horror flick.

One word about the DVD though - it has a few short documentary features on it that are worth watching. This E.V.P. thing is quite interesting and disturbing. I don't know exactly what to think of it, but it sure gives me chills.",1116979200,3,1052,4.430051813471502

There is an older gentleman who at the beginning of the film starts following Keaton and eventually itroduces Keaton to EVP. But just when another side to his character starts to emerge, he is killed off. All in all, what could have been a truly scary/ haunting/ chilling movie is marred by plot holes and miss directs, and ends up as standard tv-movie-of-the-week stuff. I'd just rent it or wait for cable. The extras are laughable. There isone about real life EVP investigators. They tell the camera man to leave them alone, and surprise! They can only get the voices on tape IF they camera man isn't around. Also, they say you can do it at home---if you have alot of background noise like running water or a fan!

For instance, I LIKED Day After Tomorrow, Van Helsing and The League of Extraordinary Gentleman, which were all pretty much trashed.  WHITE NOISE is one of those films mostly panned, and for once, I have to agree with the masses.  So much of what goes on in WHITE NOISE is either muddled or misguiding, or out and out boring.  While the premise of communicating with the dead via EVP is interesting, the execution of this in WHITE NOISE doesn't fulfill that promise.  Michael Keaton looks tired and disinterested, and there is no real resolution of exactly what went on during the film.  With a cheap ending right out of CARRIE, WHITE NOISE left me feeling cheated.  Seems like today's horror film makers like to create esoteric, ""artsy"" types of scripts and then since they themselves can't tighten the loose ends, they expect the audience to do it for them.

1521810,3,B00005JNNT,"The point at which ""White Noise"" goes off track for me is when Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) has bought into the whole idea of Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP) and bought a whole lot of electronic equipment in an attempt to contact his dead wife, Anna (Chandra West).  He has been hearing brief phrases that he is convinced are coming from Anna.  Then, for the first time, Anna's image appears on his monitor in the white noise he has recorded.  Remember, this is the dead wife he has been so desperate to contact that he has been neglecting if not frightening their son, Mike (Nicholas Elia), with his obsessive behavior.  So what does Jonathan when he finally sees Anna's face?  He closes his eyes.
Now, I would be afraid to blink because the woman I loved might disappear.  Closing my eyes would not be something that came to mind.  Of course, Jonathan does it because director Geoffrey Sax (""Tipping the Velvet"") needs to set up a ""BOO!"" moment.  If that requires the character to do something that does not make sense that is the least of his worries because the script by Niall Johnson has worst things in store.  Sax's direction makes the most out of what he has to work with to provide a general sense of creepiness, but it is the story rather than the directing or the acting that derails this one.
The basic idea of trying to communicate with a loved one after they have passed on is a compelling one and has been for centuries.  The wrinkle is that the medium of communication is through the white noise provided by electronic devices.  The legitimacy for this approach is provided at the start of the film by no less an authority figure than Thomas Alva Edison, but horror fans are simply going to be thinking ""Poltergeist.""  Of course more contemporary horror fans will be comparing ""White Noise"" to ""The Ring"" with its killer videotape and ""The Sixth Sense"" in terms of seeing dead people.  However, when you get to the end of this 2005 film you will actually be thinking of films from a different genre, which is the final fatal mistake.
From where ""White Noise"" starts where it ends up is about as far off course as I have seen a movie get in some time.  The final image of the film was adding insult to injury, although obviously that was not the intent.  The idea of grieving people grasping at the straw of EVP is a decent enough one for a film, and Jonathan in introduced to the phenomenon by Raymond Price (Ian NcNeice) and Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger), who are in similar situations. Then things start to go wrong.  A psychic screams a warning at Jonathan that he fails to heed, there are figures appearing on his monitor when he is not looking, and then people start getting hurt.

""Walls"" like that are usually the first response to encountering new ideas and if viewers can simply watch this well made film without prejudices, then perhaps the study of after death experiences will gain attention that in turn will encourage further investigation.

WHITE NOISE as written by Niall Johnson and directed by Geoffrey Sax explores the concept of EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomenon, a 'science' of recognizable words that are picked up by various electronic machines (telephones, televisions, radios, etc), words that are names of the deceased, phrases that send messages to the living (according to the scientists that work with this field the majority of the phrases are warnings of malevolent occurrences), sounds that are reproducible and are even accompanied by visual images of the departed. The DVD of this movie contains reports from those exploring this field and examples of EVP from resources outside the production of this film, providing some backup that should you watch them are informative.

John Rivers (Michael Keaton) is a successful architect happily married to successful novelist Anna (Chandra West) living in the elegant suburbs of Vancouver with his young son from a previous marriage.  Anna has just discovered that she is pregnant and the couple is ecstatic.  Anna drives off to an event concerning her latest novel but never returns.  Her car is found by the water but she is not in the car.  John wants to believe she is still alive until the police inform him the body has been found,  Devastated, John begins to hear strange sounds, discovers he is being 'stalked', but when he confronts the 'stalker' he finds a kind Raymond Price (Ian McNeice) who tells John about EVP and that he has been receiving messages from Anna.  John scoffs and yet as his anguish over Anna's death threatens to paralyze him he eventually contacts Price.  In Price's 'home lab' he meets Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger) who has just successfully spoken with and seen her departed husband.  Slowly John becomes convinced that EVP is viable and begins receiving information from Anna about events in and around Vancouver that predict malevolence.  John engages the police and pursues the messages he hears from Anna, finding predictions from beyond to be true.  Price admonishes John that while some of the voices from the other side are loving, others are evil and can destroy. And after the  bizarre death of Price, John and Sarah join in pursuing clues that eventually lead to the surprising conclusion of the story.

Yes, there are gapping holes in the script, there are character motivations left unexplained, and there is the unfortunate introduction of animation 'ghosts' toward the finale that cheapen the impact.  But the mood is terrifying and jolting and keeps you on the edge of your seat - if you just give in to the idea that EVP is a possibility.  Michael Keaton gives a superb performance in this practically one-man show and his portrayal of John gives the tone of authenticity much needed in stories such as this.

If you are a skeptic and not one who gives credence to concepts of afterlife or communication with the deceased or in general anything that can't be covered by a media group from CNN, then this film will probably not register.  But for those with open minds this is a fine suspense story and serves to open windows into thought experiences others are exploring.  Grady Harp, May 05",1116374400,2,3642,4.939344262295082

After some strange events, like receiving phone calls from his wifes cell phone (which he has) he takes a chance and goes to visit Raymond. There Raymond explains the technique EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) that he uses to communicate with the dead and they start their sessions. One night Jon receives a phone call from Raymond to come over immediately and when he arrives he finds Raymond dead on the floor.

After mysterious Raymond's death, Jon goes to another means of contacting the spirit world where he is warned about the dangers of using EVP, but still wanting to hear from his wife, Jon makes his own studio in his house to search on his own. He does finally see his wife who keeps giving him messages which lead Jon to finding others in trouble and helping them.

I will stop there so I don't give the whole movie away, but if this sounds intriguing to you, go out and rent the movie. Enjoy!

1521816,2,B00005JNNT,"White Noise has the possibility to create a horror experience, but never succeeds.  Trailers that were aired on TV before the release focused on the thrilling and frightful elements that generated an anticipation for horror, but in this regard the film truly disappoints.  This misleading anticipation for suspense affects the film's potential, as the viewers will receive drama-like venture of loss and connection with the other side.  Even if the audience is capable of adjusting to this curveball the film still suffers from awkwardness and cerebral congestion.

The successful architect, Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton), seems to have it all, as he also finds out that he is about to get another addition to his family.  His stunning second wife Anna (Chandra West) is a prominent author with several best sellers and has just discovered that she is pregnant.  In joy Jonathan returns from work with flowers and chocolate, but Anna never returns home.  He waits for hours, until he eventually finds out that she is missing, which becomes headlines in the news.

Out of the blue, a man, Raymond Price (Ian McNeice), in a Land Rover, follows Jonathan from his home to his job where he finds out that the man supposedly has had contact with his missing wife.  Raymond discloses that she is dead, and through Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP), he can hear and maybe see the dead.  However, like most sane men, Jonathan  disregards the man's plea to listen to him and turns him away.  After some strange occurrences, one of these scenes feels familiar from Takeshi Miike's One Missed Call (2003), Jonathan decides to contact Raymond.

When Jonathan meets with Raymond at his cluttered home he also run into Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger) who is trying to overcome the loss of her fianc.  Through this introduction the film begins its journey into EVP, as Jonathan begins to find a way to contact his late wife through recordings on tapes and hard drives.  Through one of these attempts Jonathan encounters an angry and intimidating voice to which Raymond simply comments with some difficulty that some are bad people while erasing the voice from the hard drive.  It is evident that this is a crucial part of the film, but instead of enlightening the audience it keeps this darkness veiled to another moment.

Throughout the film there are several moments where the audience will make loops with their eyes, as White Noise almost suggests that the audience is too dense to understand the series of occurrences.  Also, the borrowed quote by Thomas Edison in the beginning of the film suggests that the filmmakers try to use external sources to induce some form of authenticity to the story.  This, too, fails miserably and instead induces further awkwardness.  Lastly, Michael Keaton's character appears almost blinded to the point of stupidity, as he continues on his journey to find the truth and maybe more.  Well, let's put it this way, Jonathan will find more than he anticipated, but at the expense of making the film painful to watch.",1116288000,,3040,4.956607495069034
1521817,4,B00005JNNT,"When I saw previews for this in theaters, I knew that this wasn't another one of those cheap suspense films that always seem to pop-up several times during a year. This one looked good and it is good.

The story is very intriguing as Michael Keaton's character, Jonathan Rivers, tries to make contact with his recently deceased wife. Along the way, she finally makes contact with him; but she is giving him flashes into the future about people who may die unless he can save them before hand. But it is not without consequence. Three demons are out to get anyone who uses EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) equipment to try and make contact to the other side. The ending was the biggest and most surprising part about the film. I never expected it to end the way it did. I will say no more than that for I don't want to spoil it for those who have yet to see it.

Many people say there are plot holes in the film. Personally, I didn't find any so I don't know if those people just didn't seem to pay close attention or what.

Now the biggest question many of you may be asking is whether or not the film is scary. Well, it gives you several jumpy moments, but the film is more creepy than scary considering the fact that there are people out there who make contact with the dead and, as the film states, 1 our of every 12 are physically threatened. So it's something to chew on. Not to mention that such events can very well take place. So, while there were a couple of jump scenes, it was just more creepy.

The acting and special effects are very well done and it saddens me that Keaton is not in anymore respectable roles considering he is a talented actor. Of course that depends on your own assumption of his acting skills but I find him to be talented.

In conclusion, White Noise is a film that is very interesting to say the least and one that is more creepy than scary. The story unfolds at a nice pace and there is hardly a dull moment. I recommend this film to anyone looking for a creepy flick or who is into suspense films in general.",1116288000,,2046,4.290155440414508

1521819,2,B00005JNNT,"I'm not a particular horror fan, and as a confirmed skeptic I tend to nitpick about all the logical inconsistencies that invariably come with the subject of ghosts. Yet, this film did initially grab my attention and for a while even gave me a real sense of creepy suspense. I found the spare, often high tech settings an original touch. Also, the slow tempo of the beginning works quite well; small but strange events are cleverly timed to highten suspense, without going all out on cheap scares. But eventually things get really going, and the promising start turns out to be a prelude to a banal and unconvincing plot. Even then, there are some very stylish and eerie touches - e.g. the subtle, almost imperceptible rush of three shadows away from the car crash site where Rivers is sent by his wife's ghost to do some rescue work. But then again, the whole idea of ghosts operating like some supernatural 911-slash-mafia strikes me as fairly ludicrous. The eventual disappointment of supernatural movies (as well as the antics of ""real"" spiritists, for that matter) is that the dead always seem so inexplicably concerned with the daily hassles of mortals. The final unraveling is far-fetched, unsatisfying, and leaves us with a plot-line full of holes. Furthermore, characters are undeveloped and unconvincing as people. They seem to exist merely as a function of the storyline. How exactly Rivers can afford to sit in front of his TV's for days on end without getting into trouble with his business partner, is beyond me. And while the whole idea of ghosts manifesting themselves through TV static noise may succeed in steering clear of the obvious ""Poltergeist"" associations, I do wonder why the dead would want to use this cumbersome medium when, as it turns out, they are quite capable of manifesting themselves physically. They can even turn on your stereo for you, and wrestle you to the floor! Well, there I go nitpicking... The skeptic mind however is stimulated by the fact that the DVD extra's try to sell off EVP (""Electronic Voice Phenomena"") and ghosts as scientific facts, and even entice you to try capturing your own ghosts at home. Well, in the end that may be a less disappointing endeavour than watching this movie. But seriously, in a world so full of empirically uninformed superstition and gullible people, I find such additions truly objectionable.

All in all this is hardly worth your time. I say, stick to your sense of humour and pick up that other, far more rewarding ghostmovie that Keaton starred in: Beetlejuice.",1116288000,,2546,4.893518518518518
1521850,4,B00005JNNT,"Up for debate is if EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) is real...regardless, with this being the main plot of this film, I would have to say that this was very well thought out, something that the general public has to think on...definately! Michael Keaton plays a man that has just lost his new wife, Anna, to a drowning accident. Shortly after her death, Keaton's character, Dave, begins to hear Anna's voice within the static from either the phone, or the radio. Dave becomes interested, but is still skeptic...

Enter Raymond Price, who lost his son years prior, shortly after his death, Raymond becomes intranced by EVP, going so far as to basically make a business out of this, in hopes of helping others find lost loves within electronic devices.

After Raymond dies of natural causes (heart attack it seems), Micheal has become such a believer, he basically takes over where Raymond left off....

After Michael Keaton's wife dies, he begins to explore the possibility of communicating with the dead through white noise - the noise on a radio or TV that's not tuned in to any broadcast frequency.  Apparently, this provides spirits with a relatively easy way to communicate with the living.  He's hoping to communicate with his dead wife of course, but . . . you can predict the rest with 85% certainty.

1521853,1,B00005JNNT,"I anxiously looked forward to seeing this movie when I saw a lengthy promo of it at one theater's 20 minutes worth of movie news and ads. It sounded like a spiritual film in the vein of ""Dragonfly"", which I loved. So, when this film was released, I eagerly went to the theater to see it. Things didn't look to good when I was the ONLY PERSON in the theater. The first half of the movie was reminiscent of ""Dragonfly"" (another spiritual film about a middle aged man whose wife dies and attempts to contact him). Another positive was that this film was set in Vancouver (one of my favorite cities). Then it goes down from there.

Since I was the only one in the theater, it was downright frightening when the movie took a turn for the worse. It went in the opposite direction as ""Dragonfly"" and instead of leaving the theater inspired, I probably left pale white and sickened to my stomach. In a word...this film is EVIL. I hated it. The only redeeming value I give it is to say that this film is meant as a warning...not to mess with some things of the spirit world that amateurs have no business wading into. I got that much out of it. This film is scary if you believe that there are evil earthbound spirits looking for humans to manipulate. Its slow moving though and if you're expecting another ""Dragonfly"" (which I give 5 stars), then you will be disappointed by this film. ""White Noise"" is more along the lines of ""Se7en""...very dark and uncomfortable viewing experience.

The trailers looked awesome, but the trailers for Darkness were also good trailers.  And anyone who's seen Darkness knows how bad it is.  Ok, on with the review.  Michael Keaton's character has lost his wife, who is an author.  He soon meets a man on the street who says he can help him contact her again.  Naturally, Michael Keaton's character doesn't believe this for a couple of months.  It's something called 'white noise'.  The spirits can be detected through recorded video tapes, and also audio tapes.  He does manage to contact her, and becomes obsessive...until he releases something evil that is seeking him.

I enjoyed this movie THOROUGHLY.  I can tell you that much.  It's very underrated, and I wish that all these people would stop bashing it.  The slow pace helps build up for the great little ending, which I personally enjoyed.  The storyline was pretty good and had a mixture of many different supernatural flicks in it.  Like, Poltergeist and Ghost for example.  It ends up being a very creepy and entertaining flick, and one that you can walk out of the theater feeling good that you just spent 8 bucks on it.

1521887,2,B00005JNNT,"""Meh..."" I thought as I walked out this movie.

Completely disregarding the fact that it is a January movie, I had high hopes for ""White Noise"". There are some creepy situations one can explore when speaking of EVP. This film fails to find even one thing creepy.

The Opening:

It began VERY, VERY slowly-- It took quite a while for Michael Keaton's wife to die. Everyone who saw the trailer new she was going to die, so why not get that part over with? Anyway, even after enduring the snail-like beginning, I still was quite intrigued.

The Body:

Not too bad, actually, to a point. The plot was alright, until the fortune-telling part.

It wasn't the greatest setup, but the situations had some potential to hit the audience with an ending so large and spectacular, it would render them catatonic. Who were the three shadowy figures? Were they some sort of angels, demons, robots? What was their motive? Did they need human flesh to survive in the upper world, so that they could assimilate into the body of the president and take over, uh, Morocco? Why did the woman, who had no suicidal tendencies jump off a balcony? Was she possessed? Did she see an Oreo on the sidewalk? Who knows! 'Cause they don't tell you a single thing! You know, I like movies that leave a few unanswered questions to get the audience thinking, but DUDE! Tie up a few of those loose knots, will ya? I started to loose faith in the movie when they went from speaking to the dead to predicting the future. Now, c'mon! That was gettin' a little ridiculous. The plot became so absurd, that I swore little forest imps would appear to give Mr. Keaton the power to fly. Sheesh!

The End:

I thought I had seen it all until this monstrosity appeared. The ending was an M. Night Shyamalan wannabe, but totally failed on every level...I just can't explain it in words...It was horrible, ridiculous, absurd! They best summary I can give you is that it...sucked.

1521916,2,B00005JNNT,"White Noise tells the story of widower Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) who is contacted by his late wife using EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). The opening scene is a by the book `meet the happy family' moment that turns sour when Jonathan's wife goes missing. Barring one rather confusing and unexplained plot twist, this formula thriller is as predictable as they come. Like in other slow ghostly suspense films, most recently The Others, Sax tries to characterize his settings as co-conspirators. What he ends up with is about forty minutes of location footage that should have stayed in the scouting binder. Interestingly, Jonathan Rivers is an architect, and there are numerous aerial establishing shots that mirror those small cardboard plans that architects hover over, and the attention Sax lavishes onto Rivers' waterfront home and apartment home borders on the obsessive. Clearly, there was some intent in all this, perhaps to establish `everything' as haunted and ominous, but it fails. Michael Keaton stumbles through the film like a zombie, hitting his lines near the mark if not directly on. His performance is only dull because the character is dull. He falls into the same horror movie traps as they all do, backing into rooms for no reason, persisting ahead despite strange noises and terrible tidings. As a result, White Noise does offer up a few scares. I'll leave the details of the one plot twist out so as not to spoil it for anyone dead set on seeing this film, but like I mentioned before, it doesn't make sense once you think it out. If checking your brain at the door and slow paced suspense films are your cup of tea, then there are worse ways to spend two hours than White Noise, but not many.

When I saw a couple of the T.V. spots, I was absolutely ecstatic that I could see what sort of take Hollywood could conjure up regarding the idea of communicating with the dead.  It all seemed ""true to life"" so to speak, until the scene with the psychic-lunatic-fringe girl that started going on about how EVP was bad and it wasn't a good thing. This started to make me see what the movie is really about, and what message they were really trying to beam into the heads of the audience (especially ghost hunters like myself who may have been attracted to the theater).  For anyone who considers themselves active in the paranormal field, it is widely known that the christians consider communication with those in the afterlife as a ticket to instant damnation.  They are very frightened by EVP as it completely shakes their beleif structure to its core.  Now here is where my opinion could make you think I am paranoid and on the lunatic fringe myself.  The movie's official website tries to cover up the fact the movie is a tool invented by some christians by inserting a link to the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomenon.  But, the message of the movie is still unchanged: Don't attempt communiaction with the world beyond, because the results could be disastrous.  I heartily encourage other ghost hunters like myself to go see this movie and make their own judgments.  As for me, my opinion is formed and I believe that this movie is a tool made by some christians designed to frighten
those who are curious about such matters.  The movie ends with the screen reading: ""1 out of every 10 Recorded EVPs is threatening"".  Nice try, but I am not scared. Call me crazy, but that's just what I think.

UPDATE:  Okay, after doing my research, I discovered I was wrong.  The Amercian Association of Electronic Voice Phenomenon actually provided a lot of input for the creators of the movie.  Boy, I feel like an ass.  Overall, this movie is pretty decent aside from a few holes in the plot.

As a horror movie, ""White Noise"" has everything that it takes: the suspense, the ""jumping-out-of-nowhere"" scene and the visuals. However, as a story-telling movie, ""White Noise"" definitely needs many improvements on character development and portraits. For example, who the heck is the ""real killer""? That lunatic guy at the end who made a short apperance at the beginning of the movie is a big confusion factor. It almost feels as if the audience needs to know a little bit more about him. How did he become the devil helper? What is he doing? And ect.

""White Noise"" was kind of disappointing. But given the chance, I definitely would go to see another movie based on similar topics and materials.

1521967,1,B00005JNNT,"""White Noise"" had a lot of potential to be a very good movie. It could have been up in the league of other ghost movies like ""What Lies Beneath,"" but this is the kind of horror film that doesn't rely on creativity as much as cheap tricks to scare it's audience. Now, this movie did have me covering my mouth a few times in horror of what was happening. I have to give it credit for that. It seemed to scare other people as well. So if that is the kind of movie you are looking for, that go see ""White Noise."" If you would rather see a mind stimulating horror film that leaves you thinking afterwards, the stear clear of this film.

The premise is that Michael Keaton is happy with his life. He has a satisfying and successful career and is married to a celebrity writer who is expecting a baby. Her sudden unexpected death completely shatters his world and also causes some weird electrical surges around the house causeing all of the radios to suddenly turn on to (what else?) static. He also starts receiving phone calls from his deceased wife's cell phone, which is no longer operating. He is viseted by a man who tells him that he has received messages from his wife for him. It takes him a while to realize it's true, but when he does, he gets addicted to white noise. So much so, that he devotes all of his TV's and his computer to listening to ghosts. However, there are bad ghosts out there who only want to cause damage! Duhn duhn duhn!

The numerous plot flaws really bugged me. The audience didn't really get to know the main characters new wife, so it was hard to feel sorrow for her loss. He also had a son from his previous marriage that got the shaft when his fater was consumed by white noise and also was completely unnecessary. It seemed as if the writers had filled the story with characters just to fill up time, but a lot of them were not needed. They also found it very hard to write themselves out of the ending. You see, the writers never bothered to tell the audience who the bad ghosts were or why they were doing the things they did. Their explanation was simply that they liked to cause damage. They didn't explain a lot of things. And it wasn't in a good way like ""Donnie Darko"" was. It was in a stupid way. They didn't tell us because they probably didn't know themselves. And my biggest gripe with the ending (drumroll please...) WARNING: I AM ABOUT TO SPOIL IT SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW, SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH! They killed off Michael Keaton, the main character, because they had written themselves into a hole. It wasn't like in the end of ""The Grudge"" where Sarah Michelle Geller thought she had defeated the curse and then you see the creepy oriental woman behind her. Oh no! The bad ghosts killed him and then there was his funeral where his own son didn't even cry!

So I highly recomend you don't waste your money on ""White Noise."" If you really need to see a horror film, I suggest trying your rental store. This movie was horrible.",1105747200,4,2979,4.344703770197486
1521968,2,B00005JNNT,"I didn't like this very much.

Good idea, but with no good movie",1105660800,4,133,4.28
1521969,4,B00005JNNT,"It is a pleasant surprise to walk into a movie expecting to dislike it, and to leave the theater satisfied.

Having read some of the reviews on this site, as well as some professional reviewers, I think they've missed the point of this film entirely. Reviewers on this site have also gotten their facts wrong. For example, Keaton has been in three movies since Jack Frost (yes, I agree that film was a disaster), and he served as the Executive Producer on another.

Jonathan Rivers' (Keaton) wife dies in a car accident and like all husbands who adore their wives, he grieves. One day he sees a man sitting in an SUV across the street from his house, and when he gets to work that same day, the man is sitting on a bench across the street. Rivers rushes out to ask why he is following him, and the man introduces himself as Raymond Price (Ian McNeice). Price claims that Keaton's wife has passed over, and that she has communicated with him. Rivers immediately dismisses this, but Price leaves him with a card, asking that he keep it.

The movie skips ahead six months, and we find Rivers moving into a new apartment. Unlike the home he shared with his wife, it is forbidding and cold: the walls are either blocked glass or grey cement.

Then he receives a phone call on his cell, and the ""name"" that comes up is ""Anna's Cell"". He rushes home and pulls out the bag of effects that the police gave him from the crash; one of the items therein is Anna's cell phone. It's off. Then he receives another call, this one while he is holding Anna's cell phone, and it too is from ""Anna's Cell"".

One morning at 2:30 the beeping of his answering machine awakens him. He gets out of bed and finds that there is one message. He plays it, and it is garbled with static.

These oddities are enough to cause Rivers to contact Price, and Rivers is introduced to the world of EVP, a phenomenon whereby one can receive messages from loved ones that have passed on through recorded white noise, and sometimes cause images on a monitor. Price has, literally, hundreds of video tapes and recordings, and he plays Rivers the voice of his wife, which, I believe, said something along the lines of ""I love you John"". With the white noise, it was hard to tell. <grin> Here's the first possibility of a ""gaping plot hole"" - Rivers immediately believes it is real, and becomes obsessed with getting to the next level of communication: seeing her face on a television screen. I have to agree that I thought he bought into it a little too quickly; however, hearing the voice of one's dead spouse can evoke emotions that make a person do things they normally wouldn't. As a person who has lost a spouse, trust me on this, I know.

Before Rivers is able to get to the next level Price winds up dead, all of his monitors and audio equipment (of which there was a considerable amount) destroyed, with Price buried underneath them.

This causes Rivers to set up a station of his own in his home, where he all too quickly develops a tremendous facility with highly advanced equipment. That may be another gaping plot hole, but it's forgivable. Do we really want to see Rivers poring through training manuals and teaching himself how to use this equipment? Of course not. *That* would be boring and unessential to the plot.

Assisting him is a client of Price's that he met when he first visited, Sarah Tate (Deborah Karah Unger). The more time Rivers spends with his own equipment, the more obsessed he becomes, to the point of having his ex-wife watch their son for longer periods, to flatly ignoring his son when he has physical custody. (That's unforgivable, but understandable when caught in the throes of an obsession.)

After a frustrating amount of time where nothing happens, suddenly he starts receiving messages from his wife. They're no longer the simple I Love You messages, but are instructive, telling him to go to certain places to save people.

This is where the movie gets interesting, because this is where the horror element kicks into high gear - and this is where I gained tremendous respect for the film. We had already received hints of external interference (apparitions), and we start to see more of them. There were several scenes where typical cheap horror frights could have been inserted just to get someone to squeal, but the director showed tremendous restraint, and for that I have great respect for him.

The ending was a complete surprise, and a very satisfying one, as it doesn't end like virtually every standard, schlock horror movie - which our country seems to produce as quickly as rabbits procreate. You don't need to be a genius, but you need to think about the ending, and remember bits of what has happened earlier in the film. If you don't pay attention, you'll miss it, and it might make the entire film seem irrelevant. But if you do pay attention, and you understand what is going on (I'll just say this: pay close attention to the fact that in the final sequence there is a set of monitors *just like Price and Rivers had* - and what could that possibly be for), it makes for a very clever ending.

The dnouement is touching, although the final view the movie presented to us was unnecessary, and almost qualified as a stupid horror movie ruse, which this movie avoided almost entirely. Thankfully.

I thought to myself as I left the theater: finally, a horror movie whose main goal wasn't to make me hop out of my seat through cheap tricks, is well filmed, well acted, and directed with subtlety instead of a ham handed hammer and a bag full of tricks.",1105660800,146,5568,4.577309236947791

1521981,3,B00005JNNT,"White Noise (Geoffrey Sax, 2005)

Michael Keaton took some time off from the movie world, having appeared in only four films since the career disaster that was Jack Frost. White Noise marks his return to full-time cinema, and to be honest, we should probably have known what to expect, given that he's coming out with a Herbie: The Love Bug movie later this year.

Geoffrey Sax (Tipping the Velvet) makes the leap from small screen to big screen here. Some people understand what it taken to move from TV directing to movie directing. Sax does not, which does have the benefit of ensuring that White Noise will make for a good DVD rental. Save your money where theatres are concerned, though, as thirty-six-foot-wide screens do nothing to enhance what charms this movie has.

The film, which plays out in the trailers as an edge-of-your-seat suspense thriller, is actually about Jonathan Rivers (Keaton), an architect whose wife disappears one night and is presumed dead. Keaton has to adjust to life without her, and in the process of doing so, becomes obsessed with trying to contact her spirit. Which, when it comes right down to it, is your basic Lifetime Original Movie, except that the star is male and it has a supernatural element to it. The first hour contains very little in the way of actual suspense, though there's a baldly manufactured subplot meant, I assume, to inspire some.

The suspense shows up in the last half-hour, and to be fair, the movie does contain a few moments of genuine creepiness. Sax, however, is incapable of sustaining it for longer than a moment at any one time, leaving the viewer with an odd, slow-motion version of the feeling one gets when watching a generic slasher flick. You jump, kind of, for thirty seconds instead of an instant.

It's a watchable movie, but not much more than that. The trailers and TV ads call it ""the most disturbing movie in years."" Sorry, guys, it's not even the most disturbing American movie in years. Overseas, there have been comedies more disturbing than this. (Go rent Ichi the Killer and see what I mean.) ** ",1105488000,,2084,4.759002770083103
1521982,2,B00005JNNT,"When Anna Rivers (West) says goodbye to her husband one day, Jonathan (Keaton) does not realize that it will be the last time he sees her alive.  Her mysterious death leaves him shrouded in mourning.  Enter Raymond Price (McNeice) and a client of his, Sarah Tate (Unger).  They are able to convince Rivers that his dead wife is talking to Price via EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomenon.  EVP is when the dead talk to the living through prerecorded static.

Once a believer, he throws himself into getting as much of it as he can, buying a lot of equipment to help him communicate with Anna.  The only problem is that it might not be Anna who is communicating with him, but something more sinister.

""White Noise"" takes an interesting idea and mangles it to death.  The movie would suggest that it is quite easy to communicate with the dead.  After all, Jonathan has tremendous success almost right off the bat.  Also, the idea of talking with the dead is overshadowed by evil spirits that apparently just like to kill people.  I am probably playing spoiler with some plot points here, but I am not too bothered.  There are some interesting ideas presented in ""White Noise"" besides EVP, among which is obsession, but they are glossed over for the cheap scares that are easy to see coming.  Michael Keaton has not had a notable movie in years, and ""White Noise"" will not change that.",1105401600,2,1380,4.62962962962963

I thought this movie was better than The Grudge and the suspense kept me interested in the movie almost the entire time. What really caught my attention about this movie was when I saw the commercial mentioning Ruth Baxter and how the dead can communicate with us through EVP (Electrical Voice Phenomenon). Sadly to say the commercial was misleading since this movie did not go very far in to the EVP pheomomenon. White Noise got bad reviews from many critics but despite the negativity it did a great job the first weekend of its release opening in a very immpresive #2 with 24 Million dollars. To me this movie was entertaining and not half as bad as what the critics would expect you to believe. This is only rated PG-13 so it is not going to be as scary as you might think, but it is a good movie that is worth watching.",1105228800,48,895,4.397590361445783

1521985,3,B00005JNNT,"~ENDING SPOILER~

White Noise is another one of many ""scary"" PG-13 movies to come out recently (i.e The Grudge, Darkness, The Forgotton,) most of which I haven't cared for. But I saw an interesting trailer for White Noise some months ago and decided this one might be worth checking out. As a kid, I remember being frightened by stories of EVP (Electrical Voice Phenomenon,) on shows like Sightings and the thought of it still freaks me out today. So I was instantly drawn to this idea of a scary movie.

For the most part, White Noise was moderately scary and that's a lot more than I can say for movies like The Ring or The Grudge, which I didn't find scary at all. The movie has a slow start, but the scary scenes it does have come unexpectedly. This is probably the first scary PG-13 that has actually made me jump at a few parts. With movies like the The Grudge, I completely anticipated the next scene where the ghost would pop and scare everyone in the audience except me. White Noise actually caught me off guard a couple of times. Plus, the general idea behind the movie itself was creepy, because there are plenty of real life EVP happenings on record and if you have ever heard an actual sound wave of one, you know that it makes the hair on your neck stand up on end.

Some things I didn't like about the movie. It did have a slow start. It almost got boring right before the first really scary part. I also found the climax to the movie a little confusing as far as storyline goes. I'm also kind of sick of seeing an ending where a CGI ghost that looks like black smoke attacks for the climax. It was almost a let down in the movie having a suspenseful buildup to the climax and end it with three computer generated ghosts freaking out indistinctly. Not a very scary ending. And I also thought the part right before the end credits, the part that's supposed to leave you on edge when you leave the theater, was kind of dumb and didn't really make that much sense.

All in all, not really too bad of a movie. I found it scarier (not saying I was scared out of my wits or anything) than a lot of these PG-13 movies coming out and a much better idea. But a dull ending kept the film from being good. Probably could've done with two or three more scary parts as well.

He's always had some indescribable charisma and he puts it to good use here in 'White Noise'.  The film itself is based on an interesting, but obscure, real life subject:  electronic voice phenomena.

The movie unfortunately doesn't really do anything with its fairly original premise.  Its fairly by-the-numbers with no major surprises.
