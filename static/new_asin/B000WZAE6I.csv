8226158,1,B000WZAE6I,"I was really hoping for something more along the lines of Tromaville or Something Weird, but I was totally wrong.  It is a promotional video for some boring, homemade, obscure horror and exploitation flicks.  Not even trailers for the interesting, and obscure cult classics, but rather the ""this is why you shouldn't waste your time on this"" trailers.  I saved myself the dough watching it on Netflix instead of buying it.  I'm glad I did, but I still feel robbed.

I wish I could give it more than one star, but it seriously is a waste of time.  Even if you're a huge fan of Misty Mundane (the biggest selling point, which doesn't say much), I would never recommend actually paying for something that should be distributed free with a catalog.  You can do better, much better, elsewhere...  Anywhere.",1379289600,,801,4.712230215827338
8226159,5,B000WZAE6I,"Trailer Trash! ROCKS.  instead of just watching all the trailers on youtube, they finally released all the upcoming films on two dvds.",1226275200,2,134,5.090909090909091
8226160,1,B000WZAE6I,Trash is a good way to describe this release. Nothing but advertisements for this company's own releases and not at all what I expected when I bought it. I take it back...this isn't trash it's garbage. DO NOT BUY!,1202428800,20,213,4.487179487179487
8226161,1,B000WZAE6I,"As a big fan of ""trailer"" compilations, I had high hopes for Trailer Trash based on its description. Trailers are usually great fun when we cringe at the often earnest, and nearly always bizarre, attempts to make serious movies by rank amateurs. Trailer Trash illustrates what happens when you don't even try. Most of the ""gore"" moves (Disk 1) are direct-to-video screamers with buckets of fake blood and little else. Disk 2 (the erotic disk, I guess) is pretty much just silicone-enhanced lesbians, again direct-to-video. Like the ""Something Weird Sampler"", this is in reality a long commercial; unlike SWS, these trailers are not fun to watch.",1201219200,19,645,5.09433962264151
