5088441,5,B007I4HM48,"A must buy! I have already watched this movie twice and it gives me goose bumps.  It teaches so many important lessons, but the one that stands out the most is determination.  An awesome group of ladies accomplished a very impressive feat despite setbacks in their lives. I loved it, so will you!",1332547200,2,296,4.566037735849057
5088442,5,B007I4HM48,"This movie represents both endurance and education.  1 in 8 women is affected by breast cancer, so for a group of women who were either affected, survived or lived with breast cancer to attempt this magnificent feat is awe-inspiring.  As a breast cancer survivor and endurance athlete, I am reminded that we all need to live our lives to the fullest and that nothing is not do-able, as long as we work hard and believe in ourselves.  These women believed in themselves and accomplished what most would consider un-doable.  This movie makes me want to go skydiving!!!!",1332460800,2,567,4.814432989690721
5088443,5,B007I4HM48,"This is a must-see for anyone who wonders ""how did they do that?"" and ""why did they do that?"" and who wants to know alternative offerings about breast cancer awareness, prevention, and detection.  This is NOT a film that brags about a world-record skydive completion.  It's about the heart and soul of the skydiving participants.  It's about breast cancer survivors.  It's about awareness and prevention.  It will hold your attention until the very end.",1332374400,2,453,5.0675675675675675
5088444,5,B007I4HM48,"A wonderful film reminding us all the power of love is infinite and grand.  Take the leap, fly Pink Skies.  It's a rush!!!  : )",1332374400,,127,4.0
5088445,5,B007I4HM48,"This is an entertaining, educational, and very thoughtful film about skydiving, breast cancer, and women. The filming is beautiful and the film engages you in the spirit of ""jump for the cause"" not only because of the athleticism of the women, but the breast cancer sufferers and survivors that take part in the jump. Renowned experts are consulted and interviewed in the film, giving it some scientific weight, and though it is not technical in that regard it does raise some very important points about health. This is a wonderful film, well worth your watching time. Also, I think this is a great movie to share with friends and family who may have (struggled with) cancer.",1332374400,2,676,4.836206896551724
5088446,5,B007I4HM48,"Was transfixed with the Documentary Channel broadcast of this powerful film by Gulcin Gilbert, and was very happy to see it added to Amazon.com as an upcoming title for DVD pre-orders.  The film succeeds in so many ways:  it entertains, it motivates, it illuminates and it illustrates the power of group efforts to achieving even the loftiest of goals.  The film also provides enlightening information on new medical theories behind the sudden rise in Breast Cancer rates, and posits everyday things that we can do to reduce our risks.  Great, Great, Great documentary, definitely worth buying.",1331078400,4,594,5.15625
8517259,5,B007I4HM48,"Bosom Buddies, a breast cancer support group at Banner Baywood Medical Center, has seen this video twice. It's awesome.",1431820800,,119,5.315789473684211
8517260,5,B007I4HM48,"I thought it was not only very informative, I enjoyed the footage of the Jump for the Cause. My daughter-in-law was on the jump as were some other friends. Lots of good information, about cancer.",1420934400,,195,4.6
8517261,5,B007I4HM48,I have not yet watched it. But I here it is great.,1416182400,,50,3.25
8517262,5,B007I4HM48,"I know many of the 'girls' in this video so somewhat biased by friendships but that said; if it was not good, I would be the most critical. I love this, have watched and rewatched. Give it as a gift to cancer survivors, close friends, and anyone needing an uplift. The jumping footage is some of the best you will see anywhere. The behind the scenes interviews and the planning involved in such an event accurately exhibit the state of the sport of jumping. The medical and research aspects of the film are lengthy and insightful. A friend who received this as a gift, 5 y.o. daughter watches it endlessly. A documentary, yes, but has drama, the good kind. High recommendation!",1388275200,,677,4.603305785123967
8517263,5,B007I4HM48,"This film is so powerful. First, women breaking a women's record by skydiving. Second, the empowerment of educating yourself about eating right and learning about what causes cancer. The professionals speaking in the film are amazing and the women in the film are very diverse and coming from around the world. The film footage of the skydiving is one of a kind and very special. They are all women who keep trying over and over the break the world record and when they do you feel like jumping up in the air for them. It is a very good film that should be shown in classrooms and homes around the world.",1372032000,2,604,4.45045045045045
8517264,4,B007I4HM48,Well done documentary of how some world-class athletes have helped fight back against a dreaded disease that can affect all of us.,1368662400,2,130,4.954545454545454
8517265,5,B007I4HM48,"I bought it because I am a skydiver. This isn't a skydiving movie. It is a story about a young lady overcoming breast cancer. It is not as good as Schindler's List or Star Wars. Still, it needs to be on your list of must see movies.",1355270400,3,232,3.9574468085106385
8517266,5,B007I4HM48,You don't have to be a woman or a cancer victim/survivor to be affected by this moving documentary.  The dedication and courage of so many women from all over the world is truly inspiring.,1341446400,2,188,4.529411764705882
8517267,5,B007I4HM48,I was part of the small crowd who had the privilege to watch a pre-release screening with the director and most of the amazing skydiving ladies in the film. Absolutely moving documentary on the suffering caused by breast cancer. It also showcases the tremendous happiness and relief of not succumbing to a killer. An excellent drama of brave ladies fighting to live for themselves and their loved ones. A must buy ...,1333238400,2,417,4.805555555555555
8517268,5,B007I4HM48,This film is for everyone who will be inspired to never give up.  An entertaining and heartfelt tribute to women who choose their unique way of coming together to share and give. See it then encourage others to do the same.,1332720000,,223,4.439024390243903
