8689206,3,B00PTWBV5W,"The hero searches for hidden Inca gold and a precious diamond while battling gangsters known as The Spiders. This is an interesting adventure story and well done for 1919. If you're a silent movie fan, you should watch this. If  you do not usually watch silent movies, there are far more interesting silent movies you would enjoy.",1473206400,,330,4.7894736842105265
