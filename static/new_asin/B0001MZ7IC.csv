2017778,5,B0001MZ7IC,"Hoping to capitalize on their phenomenal hit Stone Age series The Flintstones, Hanna-Barbera ""scatter-zoomed"" viewers into the 21st century with their Space-Age family series The Jetsons. The series was originally seen in primetime in 1962 on ABC where it ran for a single season and on Saturday mornings over the big three networks for many seasons thereafter. In 1985, new episodes were produced to supplement the '60s season. The '80s episodes, which featured episode title cards (used for entire series in syndication and this '60s collection) and new character Orbity, comprise the show's remaining two seasons. While the futuristic Jetsons was presented from a '60s perspective (with a few ideas/concepts actually realized), the relatable characterizations supplied by the excellent voice cast led by George O'Hanlon (voice of George Jetson) continues to entertain viewers of all ages in the real 21st century and beyond. Preserve your TV heritage with this classic DVD collection!

This is a cartoon that I would feel safe showing to a child of any age, they might even learn a lesson or two from it. For any adults watching it the stories are a bit cheesy at times but they are still solid stories about the troubles a futuristic family might face, at least what people thought they might be at the time the show was made.",1465430400,4,463,4.213483146067416

2017839,4,B0001MZ7IC,I remember these in reruns as a kid and while not as liked by my as the Flintstones I still liked the cartoons. Apparently that was true in general as the Flintstones ran many more seasons than the Jetsons.,1452211200,,206,4.3076923076923075
2017840,5,B0001MZ7IC,Great Cartoons from the Past.  This was a staple cartoon back in the 70's.  If you like the Jetson's this is the one to get.  They only made the one season.  The other seasons where made later and are not that good.,1450483200,,215,4.0476190476190474
2017841,4,B0001MZ7IC,"THE JETSONS-THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON: After the rock solid success of ""modern stone-age family"" THE FLINTSTONES, HANNA-BARBERA went in the other direction for THE JETSONS, their third prime time series. This far out family of the future included GEORGE JETSON (voiced by GEORGE O'HANLON), wife JANE (PENNY SINGLETON, who played comic strip homemaker BLONDIE on film), brainy boy ELROY (the endlessly talented DAWS BUTLER), teenaged daughter JUDY (JANET WALDO), and SCOOBY DOO prototype ASTRO (DON MESSICK) who growled semi-intelligent English, albeit with an ""R"" in front of every word. Much of the series' humor was derived from the latest space age conveniences, from push button meals and big screen phones to moving sidewalks and bubble-domed jet cars. GEORGE slaved two days a week under blustery, vertically challenged  COSMO SPACELY (played to tyrannical perfection by MEL BLANC), while his home life dealt with JANE's fashion obsession, JUDY's close encounters via teen idols like JET SCREAMER and ELROY's science projects gone awry. Although it only lasted one season (discounting a best forgotten eighties reboot featuring all the original voice actors), THE JETSONS' sharp writing, ingenious gadgetry and high camp sci-fi antics will always be welcome in a world where laughter never goes out of style.

Uniblab and Elroy's TV Show are my favorite episodes. Janet Waldo, Daws Butler, Don Messick and Mel Blanc are the most memorable voices. Penny Singleton, who voiced Jane Jetson, played Blondie in the movies. This is a good program to show to GrandChildren, Nieces and Nephews.",1438560000,3,595,4.730769230769231

I do too ... if sci-fi is contemporary entertainment with all the volume knobs turned up (to 11), then The Jetsons is a priceless example. Basic 1950s family sitcom comedy, repurposed with futuristic hijinks and knowing winks to the ""tomorrow"" just beyond the space race that was in all the headlines. As conventional as these episodes are, they still come off as original and entertaining. Worth the price, though I try to boycott Warner Home Video for occasions when they've mislabeled disc contents.

The discs have the usual menu structure and functions, but with an option on the Top Menu: ""Play all."" Handy. The menus are simple but well done. More DVD producers need to understand, ""simple is better"" in most cases.

The book-like slip case has nice artwork inside. Pretty durable.

2017929,3,B0001MZ7IC,"While skimming through watchxonline.com I discovered episodes of the Jetsons. This was an unexpected surprise so I of course had to watch a few. (All I really remembered about the show is Judy winning a date with Jet Screamer, Elroy playing some new form of basketball, and these little gremlin like things that sabotage the plant because it is tearing up their home.)

I was more than pleased with what I saw on this show. The first episode is full of clever jokes that stand the test of time: Jane complains about hating to do housework, it's so time consuming, you have to press a button for a robot to vacuum, press a second button for the laundry to get done...George complains about his exhausting day of work at his three hour shift where he had to press the on switch FIVE TIMES! They have to do push buttons exercises so their fingers can properly work the various buttons. A skilled homemaker is someone who can ""punch out"" a good meal.

The food system sort of reminds me of a star trek replicator: You just push a button for what you want and it appears on the table.

It's funny to see the hundreds of ways they've invented for machines to do everything so that people have to do no more than life a finger. Even brushing your teeth is automated.

The cons are that the dialogue is somewhat stilted and the theme song could certainly use some work. The television is supposed to be 3D but it doesn't look any different than the rest of the images. Oddly their bedroom isn't the same from one episode to the next. Some gags are repeated in slightly different forms from episode to episode (like George being woken up by the bed). The characters have no depth, though I don't really expect more from a cartoon.

It's a little odd how similar Jane's mother and Sam's mother Endora from Bewitched are. They talk with a similar accent and tone, they try to talk their daughters into doing things the husbands don't want, the daughters turn to them when they get an answer from their husband that they don't like...

If you have twenty or so minutes of time to kill, I recommend trying the show now. Nostalgia is always fun.",1308614400,,2131,4.479381443298969

2017931,5,B0001MZ7IC,I watched this family light up space over 40 years ago so I was pleasantly surprised when my daughter had a chance to watch one episode and she got hooked. I made the purchase and it has been non stop George for weeks. She also had a chance to see a episode of the Flintstones and believe me Fred should be at my house in a few weeks. In this age of high tech toys and tv shows with so much sexual content its wonderful to see that simple humor and silly situations can still bring a smile to a child.,1296518400,,501,3.9702970297029703
2017932,4,B0001MZ7IC,"When I was a child, I watched reruns of The Jetsons on weekday afternoons after grade school. The Jetsons aired on ABC for one season in 1962. Hanna-Barbera started season two of The Jetsons in 1985! After two more seasons, they started production on Jetsons: The Movie(1990). After watching a lot of movies and TV shows that take place in a dark, dystopic, nightmarish future, The Jetsons feels like a breath of fresh air as The Jetsons takes place in a bright, fun, utopia of a future. Some scenes in Back to the Future Part II(1989) and TV's Futurama(1999-) are an homage to The Jetsons. The Jetsons theme song by Hoyt Curtin has been used in dish soap commercials and sci-fi music CD's! I'd have a ball with a gadget such as a Flying Suit!
A Family Guy episode spoofed the scene where Jane takes George Jetsons' wallet so she could shop! This season one DVD set has the Jetsons theme recorded in 1962, but it uses CGI-enhanced footage from 1985.
 The TV critics are right. The Jetsons is ""silly and unpretentious"", but that's why it's fun! My favorite character isn't even human! Mac is a robot who cleans an apartment building. However, he starts to malfunction when he has a crush on Rosie The Robot Maid! Mac looks like a filing cabinet with a metal head. This Jetsons season one DVD has a fair amount of extras and it's a good place to start if you want an introduction to the world of The Jetsons.",1293753600,5,1406,4.4921875

My only complain is that the Jetsons, some of the Flintstones seasons and Yogui Bear does not include the spanish language too. No problem with our english, but the mexican /spanish original dubbing is outstanding (i.e. Top Cat characters have different personalities vs the english voices).

2017946,5,B0001MZ7IC,"It's too bad The Jetsons only lasted one season back in 1962, but they fared better in Saturday morning reruns. It was the future's answer to The Flintstones (also produced by Hanna Barbera), with space-age gadgets and references to the future (think Las Venus, which was known as Rock Vegas on the other show and Ed Solarvan, which was known as Ed Sullystone, etc). George O'Hanlon was the voice of George Jetson, Penny Singleton played his wife Jane, Janet Waldo was daughter Judy, and Daws Butler played their boy, Elroy. Also, Mel Blanc played Mr. Spacely, George's boss (before Trump said ""You're fired!"" to one unlucky person each week, Spacely said it almost every week, but with more passion: ""Jetsoooooooooon, yoooooooooooou're fiiiiiiiired!"") and Don Messick played Rastro, I mean Astro, the family dog. There's not a whole to write about with the extras, except that there are a few commentaries by Janet Waldo.

Highlights include the openning episode where Judy wins a date with Jet Screamer (""Baby, baby, baby! Ah-ah-ah!"" Jet performs ""The Swivel"" and ""Eep Opp Ork, Ah-ah!""), George loses his job at Spacely Sprockets (as he did several times) to a scheming robot called Uniblab (""Spacely's a stoop! Spacely's a stoop!""), Astro swallows Elroy's spaceship and the family thinks they have a flying dog (when Mr. Spacely hears about this, he uses it as a weapon against his competitor, Cogswell Cogs), Elroy meets his hero Nimbus the Great (""It's spaaaaaaaaaace magic!""), George shrinks down to size and in order to get him back to size, he needs to aquire a cog from Mr. Spacely's rival, Cogswell Cogs (the best part is when George is trapped in a glass, so he uses a safety pin on Cogswell to escape), Mr Spacely is the judge in a Miss Universe beauty contest, much to the chagrin and jealousy of Mrs. Spacely (George takes over Spacely's spot when the angry missus dethrones him and is enthralled by Miss Western Hemisphere, whom you can guess really turns out to be), Astro is introduced and at first is not well-received by George and in another episode the Jestons find out his original owners want him back and that Astro's real name is Tralfaz (""Rich roruddy ran rery!""), Mr. Spacely and George ditch a PTA meeting for a computerized football game (""Good evening, honey, I have to work much later than I... much later than I... much later than I....""), Rosie the Robot is introduced (Jean Vanderpyl supplies Rosie's voice) and in another episode is set up with male robot Mac, thanks to the apartment janitor Henry (""Mac is the most-ut!"", ""Rosie, beep! beep!""), Elroy and Astro get their own TV series ""Spaceboy, ZOOM!"") and in another episode, Elroy's parents think he's brought home a poor report tape which really belongs to another schoolmate and punish him so Elroy and Astro run away (watch for the ""15 billionth rerun of The Flintstones"").

That's a lot of episodes to enjoy. Like The Flintstones inspired The Jetsons, there would be a reunion of the 2 in The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones and both series did a spinoff on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. So just relax and enjoy some bona fide ""spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace magic!""",1215043200,,3153,4.880597014925373
2017947,4,B0001MZ7IC,"We are careful what we let our kids watch.  We are not into using the TV as a babysitter exposing our kids to hours of TV or mindless commercials.  Almost everything they watch is recorded on Tivo or from a DVD.  Having access to good TV on demand is the first reason; the second is because we very much dislike commercials.  Anyway...I was remembering how much I liked The Jetsons when I was a kid and I thought my sons would get a kick out of it.  Well, I was right.  They loved it and wanted to keep watching it.  I never realized this show ran for one season only and started in 1962.  One of the hints about when it was written and produced...it's a little sexist.  It's a sign of the times...beyond that, they don't say anything inappropriate and it is not a violent show.

The outer sleeve is made of plastic and the insert that holds the dvd's fits in very tightly so I have a hard time getting it out...don't want to tear/crack the plastic shell.  Other than that, this DVD set is great!",1185062400,,323,4.35
2017954,4,B0001MZ7IC,"I'll say this up front -- I'm not the biggest Hanna-Barbera fan when it comes to their creativity. Usually, when they aren't ripping off others (sometimes without attribution, even 40 years later), they were ripping off themselves.

Yet, with The Jetsons, they might have been more creative in that original first season than they were in entire runs of some of their other animated series.

The setup of the show could be said to be ""The Futuristic Flintstones, Minus The Rubbles."" Again, ripping themselves off. But while the H-B boys never held themselves out to be a Asimov and Bradbury, they did a solid job of projection with some subtle commentary on the future by extrapolating the present (as they saw it).

George's incredibly short work week and the push-button convenience of their apartment? Judgements on moving violations were instantaneous by judges who were either sponsored or on tape.

Check out the architecture and some of the interior design. It's only a slightly exaggerated version of the ultra-geometric modern 1960s design, popular in banks and schools of the era and replicated today in some buildings. As a matter of fact, the nearby supermarket built in 1998 is called ""The Jetsons Publix"" by many of us locals. Upon seeing a bank in one episode, I was struck by how it resembled a nearby bank built just a few years ago.

Another plus for this DVD set -- like The Flintstones DVD sets, you get full episodes with original opening and closing credits. Even the 1960s episodes shown on Boomerang often strip The Jetsons classic closing credits in favor of static closing credits that combine the 1960s eps with the 1980s syndicated eps. OK, there is that episode-preceding bumper with the episode title that has Orbity from the 1980s episodes, but that's forgivable.

The extras are weak, which takes this DVD down a step. Still, I glad I bought it. I find some of the episodes more amusing and interesting now than when I was 10 and watching on Saturday or Sunday morning.",1182643200,,2001,4.853372434017595
2017955,5,B0001MZ7IC,"Though not as popular as The Flintstones, The Jetsons had a more subtle atmosphere of being a classic 60s sitcom Toon.  Since George and Jane had two kids and [later] a robot maid and dog to round out the series.

Basically set into the far realms of the future, before all the 'apocalyptic' views started creeping in during the 70s, George basically drove in his 'space car' to Spacely Sprocketts, where he pushed buttons for Cosmo Spacely.

Mr. Spacely--like the typical 60s sitcom boss--always schemed in besting his rival ""Cosgwell Cogs"", and poor George would inevitably get embroiled in these schemes.  On rare occasions, however, Spacely would get George involved in other problems, like fooling the wives to go out to a Spaceball game, or takeover hosting a Beauty Pageant.

As for the rest of the family, they dealt with pretty much the problems and strifes of Sixties Suburbian life.  Now the interesting thing about The Jetsons was, although the original series didn't last long, their futuristic gadgets did inspire us with upcoming inventions, like the Microwave (inspired by the Food-a-Rac-a-Cycle), and Memory Sticks (probably inspired by the episode with Judy's mini-disc encyclopedia).  Because any new innovation we experience, we tend to associate with The Jetsons.

The Jetsons was far from being a children's television show, as the program dealt with topics on what was considered an adult level.  Though some vices were apparent from this show, like smoking and drinking, they were more on the sitcom level than what we see on television today.

What I loved about this collection, and I'm glad Warner Bros. did it right, the episodes are completely uncut, so when viewing this collection if you witness scenes you never saw in syndication, it was because they were probably cut for either content or time constraints.

For instance, in a ""Date with Judy Jetson,"" when George is pulled over, the missing scene restored is where the cop is running the list of charges.  And the classic moment is this line here:

[Cop] ..And etc. etc.

[George] Wait, I didn't see the etc. etc.

[Cop] Well, watch it.

Though it might be obscure, the restoration really brings out the series a whole lot better, and I'd recommend the series to anyone who is a fan, and those who aren't, because The Jetsons was a true piece of animation history.",1179532800,3,2350,4.9414758269720105
2017956,5,B0001MZ7IC,"Just as The Flinstones used The Honeymooners as its template, The Jetsons was paced like a 1960s sitcom, not a standard cartoon. I don't agree with the popular critical notion that the show survived for only one season because of its non-mainstream science fiction underpinnings. This DVD set offers ample proof that the show was ""deceptively simple""...layered, nuanced, subtle...and it was not your average kid cartoon. Take for example Astro the dog, perfectly voiced by Don ""Yogi Bear"" Messick. Time and time again he proves to be quicker on his feet than family patriarch George, AND...get this...the dog carries on conversations in a full human vocabulary (although every word starts with the letter ""R"" to give the required ""dog accent."") He also knows how to turn on the tears whenever he doesn't get his way, which means he gets his way 100% of the time. Then there's the dead-end, dull, ""widget"" job that George dutifully holds down...but instead of making widgets, his company makes sprockets. You say tomato, I say tomato...right? And for laughs, count the number of times over the course of the 24 episodes that Jetson's boss Mr Spacely (legendary Mel Blank) fires and re-hires him. A kid may laugh at that kind of detail, but it's only an adult who's paid some dues in the sprocket-making world who will ""get"" it. Spacely is essentially a re-write of The Flintsones' ""Mr. Slate,"" with the difference being that Spacely has a kinder heart, is less self-centered and selfish, and...while he manipulates Jetson just as Slate manipulates Fred Flintstone...he actually seems to like the guy underneath it all. The series thrived in syndication and later episodes (plus a movie) were made, but they're all inferior to the original (due in no small degree to the voice talent in the original episodes). This was an example of Hanna-Barbera attempting a new spin on their proven formula, and while it didn't win a large, sustainable audience in its original 1962 Sunday evening time slot, it's survived the test of time.",1178409600,4,2025,4.994082840236686

While season 2 was produced by Hanna-Barbera, it wasn't distributed by Warner Bros. it was distributed by Worldvision. Which may explain why it hasn't been released. Many properties owned by Worldvision (Tales from the Darkside, Monsters to name two) haven't been released on dvd.

No, Season 2 isn't from the golden age of Hanna-Barbera, but indeed it warranted the return of it's three major voice talents, all nearing their 80's: George O'Hanlon (George Jetson), Penny Singleton (Jane Jetson) and Mel Blanc (Mr Spacely).

For animation purists, this revival may not be as good as the first season, but it certainly doesn't deserved to be panned...it's fun and that's what cartoons are all about (isn't it?)

2017971,3,B0001MZ7IC,"As other reviewers mentioned here, the 'second season' of ""The Jetsons"" was created in the 1980s, with a syndicated show. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it wasn't really ""The Jetsons"", as this 'first season' set offers. The original(and, in my mind, only) Jetsons is the one offered here. It debuted, in primetime, on ABC, in 1962. It was one of several primetime animated series attempts. Bugs Bunny and his Warner's friends, The Flintstones clan, Top Cat and buds, and Bullwinkle were others(with the Flintstones being the most successful-until the pinnacle of network primetime animation came around: ""The Simpsons"", now entering its 18th season!!?). ""The Jetsons"" then ran on Saturday mornings for four years-first on ABC, then CBS, then, in its final two years, on NBC. CBS picked it up, again, in 1969, for 2 years. Then, NBC ran it throughout the early 70s and, again, fairly consistantly from 1979-83. Believe it or not, ALL of these runs were these original episodes from the first season, played over and over and over, again.

 It was in 1985 that the 'second season' was produced, with the 'third' offered in 1987-both of these were syndicated entries, and neither was very good(like most attempts at bringing back shows in the 80s). So, if you've got this first season, you've got ""The Jetsons"", basically. If you don't have it, you could easily acquire ""The Jetsons: the Complete Series"" by purchasing this, realistically. Die-hards and completists may argue with me on this, but buyer beware, the shows are lousy later in the run and all the great voice actors of the sixties program(who voiced other Hanna-Barbera's, as well) are all long gone. It's just not ""The Jetsons"". Sorry.",1156032000,69,1706,4.940766550522648

2017974,5,B0001MZ7IC,"The Jetsons: The Complete First Season comprises the first 24 episodes of the funniest cartoon ever created. Over 40 years later, you could still watch any episode and laugh your tail off. And unlike newer cartoons like The Simpsons or South Park, which are funny in their own right, The Jetsons didn't have to stoop to obnoxiousness or vulgarity to be funny. Here are a few of the many highlights of this set:

A Date with Jet Screamer: Who could forget ""Eep Opp Ork Ahh Ahh"" or ""The Solar Swivel?""

Jetsons Night Out: The robot football game is downright hysterical. ""Grimlovich, Wahjahoitz. Grimlovich, Wahjahoitz.""

Uniblab: ""Name your game, name your game. Jupiter gin, Jupiter gin. Planet poker, planet poker. Five card satellite, five card satellite.""

""Spacely's a stoop. Spacely's a stoop.""

Many episodes: ""These three hour workdays are killing me!""

And the highlights just keep coming. As noted in the special features, the show predated several inventions such as the treadmill and teleconferencing. However, the show does bring up some other observations like:

Mr. Spacely firing George nearly every show predated New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner's relationship with the late Billy Martin.

A Visit from Grandpa provided a blueprint for the classic sitcom ""Three's Company"" which premiered 15 years later. Did you ever see the episode about the misunderstanding?  Oh, that's right. That was every episode.

Did anyone ever get pulled over by the police more than George? I'm surprised they never had an episode where he was in jail.

Seriously though, this whole collection is hysterical. In addition, each episode is aired in its entirety, unlike the cut versions that are on Boomerang. In closing, no matter what age you are, The Jetsons: The Complete First Season will have you in stitches. Highest recommendation.",1136332800,11,1842,5.1891891891891895

I purchased the set and was overjoyed to see these original 1962-1963 season episodes in their glory.

Two of my favorites are Uniblab, who proclaims 'Spacely's a Stupe, stupe, stupe', and Elroy's Mob, the theme of which alludes to the effects of misjudging a child.  (I also enjoyed Kenny Countdown's wrist television that featured a rerun of The Flintstones, a nod to the show without which there would be no Jetsons, and a nod to the glory that was, is, and forever will be Joseph Barbera and William Hanna.

Now, if only Ruff 'N' Reddy could be released on DVD -- without them, there wouldn't be a Flintstones, let alone Jetsons.

2017980,5,B0001MZ7IC,"Devouring 'The Jetsons' as comic books was like opening doors to another world - and yet family life and sitcom-like story retained a homely air with a fresh and witty approach to daily chores. Future life presented itself optimistically in that many technical problems had been solved though without claiming to prevent the usual break-downs, malfunctions and familiar nuisance factors, neither in machines nor in ordinary (human) relationships. Thus the glorious perfect paradise of the future was turned down in favour of good-natured comedy with a futuristic edge - easy to comprehend by viewers of all ages.

Of course, the forward-looking series was touched very little by the great American idea of a social 'melting pot' (which was left for 'Star Trek' to explore). Thus the timelessly advanced 'Jetsons' also represent an exemplary 1960s white middle-class family with best intentions and a great deal of self-irony. The few episodes I managed to watch on TV seemed a perfect match to the books.

Would that this new (2004) multi-language release were an indication of Warner's good intentions to let the Old Continent plus its offshore islands eventually benefit from a European encoded version.

2017981,5,B0001MZ7IC,"Hanna-Barbera didn't invent limited animation, but they did perfect it. Budgets for a weekly TV cartoon were far smaller than for a one-time theatrical cartoon, and most producers didn't think it could be done. H-B not only did it, but in doing so, they also became the biggest studio and the most in demand. H-B is vastly underrated, but The Jetsons, along with The Flintstones, marks an all-time high. Don't be put off by the terrible Jetsons: The Movie, made at a time when producers were anxious to update and distance themselves from classic animation. This is the real deal. Unlike The Flintstones, The Jetsons only ran one season, but it proved so popular it re-ran on all three networks (abc, nbc, cbs)-unheard of at the time, and moved into syndication.

These 24 episodes are really all there are, but in 1984, new episodes were made introducing a new ""mascot"" character, Orbitty. A minor gripe is that for continuity the openings of this first season have been replaced with the newer opening to show Orbitty, so stations can mix the seasons. A few new episodes were also made in 1987. This four DVD set matches the other H-B/WB Golden Collection/ Classic Cartoon sets. There are a few extras, along with commentary by Janet Waldo (Judy Jetson), but it doesn't need them. The Jetsons appeared in 1962, after Top Cat and The Flintstones, The Huckleberry Hound Show (which introduced Yogi Bear), and The Ruff and Reddy Show, H-B's first entry into TV cartoons. As Daws Butler (Elroy Jetson) has said, the interaction of those early characters was pure butter. Visually the show is an imaginative feast, but listen to Waldo, Butler, Penny Singleton (Jane Jetson), the unsinkable star of Blondie, George O'Hanlon (George Jetson), not to mention Jean Vander Pyl (Rosie the robot maid), known as Wilma Flintstone, and you'll think it's radio. Play one show a day (or a week if you've got enough cartoon DVDs) for your kids, and as a new generation has taken to Scooby Do, they may discover The Jetsons.",1106870400,6,2007,4.834302325581396

George O'Hanlon was the voice of George Jetson, Penny Singleton played his wife Jane, Janet Waldo was daughter Judy, and Daws Butler played their boy, Elroy.  Also, Mel Blanc played Mr. Spacely, George's boss (before Trump said ""You're fired!"" to one unlucky person each week, Spacely said it almost every week, but with more passion: ""Jetsoooooooooon, yoooooooooooou're fiiiiiiiired!"") and Don Messick played Rastro, I mean Astro, the family dog.  There's not a whole to write about with the extras, except that there are a few commentaries by Janet Waldo.

Highlights include the openning episode where Judy wins a date with Jet Screamer (""Baby, baby, baby! Ah-ah-ah!"" Jet performs ""The Swivel"" and ""Eep Opp Ork, Ah-ah!""), George loses his job at Spacely Sprockets (as he did several times) to a scheming robot called Uniblab (""Spacely's a stoop!  Spacely's a stoop!""), Astro swallows Elroy's spaceship and the family thinks they have a flying dog (when Mr. Spacely hears about this, he uses it as a weapon against his competitor, Cogswell Cogs), Elroy meets his hero Nimbus the Great (""It's spaaaaaaaaaace magic!""), George shrinks down to size and in order to get him back to size, he needs to aquire a cog from Mr. Spacely's rival, Cogswell Cogs (the best part is when George is trapped in a glass, so he uses a safety pin on Cogswell to escape), Mr Spacely is the judge in a Miss Universe beauty contest, much to the chagrin and jealousy of Mrs. Spacely (George takes over Spacely's spot when the angry missus dethrones him and is enthralled by Miss Western Hemisphere, whom you can guess really turns out to be), Astro is introduced and at first is not well-received by George and in another episode the Jestons find out his original owners want him back and that Astro's real name is Tralfaz (""Rich roruddy ran rery!""), Mr. Spacely and George ditch a PTA meeting for a computerized football game (""Good evening, honey, I have to work much later than I... much later than I... much later than I....""), Rosie the Robot is introduced (Jean Vanderpyl supplies Rosie's voice) and in another episode is set up with male robot Mac, thanks to the apartment janitor Henry (""Mac is the most-ut!"", ""Rosie, beep! beep!""), Elroy and Astro get their own TV series ""Spaceboy, ZOOM!"") and in another episode, Elroy's parents think he's brought home a poor report tape which really belongs to another schoolmate and punish him so Elroy and Astro run away (watch for the ""15 billionth rerun of The Flintstones"").

That's a lot of episodes to enjoy.  Like The Flintstones inspired The Jetsons, there would be a reunion of the 2 in The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones and both series did a spinoff on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.  So just relax and enjoy some bona fide ""spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace magic!""",1103414400,6,3160,4.880597014925373
2017983,5,B0001MZ7IC,I love this DVD set.  My kids had never seen the Jetsons before.  They look forward to each episode now that we own the first complete season.  I look forward to owning season two when it is released.,1098403200,8,200,4.2105263157894735
2017984,5,B0001MZ7IC,"""The Jetsons"", early '60s edition, was my all-time favorite animated series for over 25 years. Well into my 3Os, I faithfully watched both these originals and the later, not-so-great '80s version. But these DVDs are, thankfully, the real thing. Here, in all their space-age glory, are George, Jane, Judy and Elroy, with all the push-button gadgets and spacy spoofs you probably grew up with- many of which came to be, like monster TV screens and moving sidewalks (but not, thankfully, things like ""cold cut capsules""). My favorite gizmos include the Astrodome-like ""Outer Space Coliseum"" with the robot football game therein (in ""Jetson's Night Out""), the hotels (dig that flying roulette wheel!) and slot-machine robots (""try-your-luck!"" ""try-your-luck""!) on ""Las Venus"", and that huge, Saturn-

headed bucket of bolts, the one and only Uni-Blab! (Don't miss that ""Jupiter Gin! Jupiter Gin!"" bit in Spacely's office- it's a hoot.)

  Hanna-Barbera animation, mundane as it often was, had the proper ""space-age"" look for this series. All the voice work, by a tight cast, still fits- including the legendary Mel Blanc, who did Mr. Spacely (with the definitive- and I mean definitive- YOU'RE FIRED!""). An unsung hero was the late Hoyt Curtin, longtime H-B musical director who did some cool space-age lounge tunes for this show- like the ""Solar Samba-Ramba"" heard on ""Las Venus"". The extras are adequate but the surprise is two commentary tracks by the very sweet and personable Janet Waldo, Judy's voice and the only living cast member. She and an uncredited Jean (Wilma) vanderPyl did most of the female parts. And did you know that zany Howie Morris, a Sid Caesar/Mel Brooks regular, did a few characters here- notably Judy's idol, space-rocker Jet Screamer?

  My personal favorites of the run are ""Jet Screamer"", ""Las Venus"", ""Astro the Millionaire"", ""Uni-Blab"" and ""Jetson's Night Out"" (that's the one with the robot football game); you may have others. Still, if you'd like to introduce your kids- and kids-at-heart- to something that millions of us really thought would be The Future back in the '60s, check this out. The Jetsons- still the spaciest 'toon of 'em all!",1094428800,11,2173,5.15625
2017985,5,B0001MZ7IC,"The Jetson's are an all-time classic cartoon and it's great that they finally released these in dvd. I'm sure many fans have been waiting a long time for this.

2017986,5,B0001MZ7IC,"While the Disney cartoons are geared for children and the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes were made for adults, somewhere in the middle is the world of Hanna-Barbera. Cartoons that are loved by all ages.

This classic from 1962 is proof positive that William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's work is timeless and still holds up 42 years(!!!) after the original broadcasts.

The bonus features are a bit light (- 1 star), but the commentaries by Janet Waldo were a pleasant surprise (+ 1 star). The title cards shown after the opening credits (added in the 80s) should have been removed (- 1 star), but they did put back the 60s end animation (""JANE! STOP THIS CRAZY THING!!!"") which had been removed in the 80s reruns (+ 1 star). All in all, the good and bad even out making this collection a 5 star set. I highly recommend this collection to anyone who loved it in 1962 during its original run, or who saw the reruns on Saturday mornings in the 70s (me), or who grew up during the 80s revival of the series...as I said, it's timeless and it keeps finding new generations of fans. Also, be sure to pick up ""The Flintstones the complete first season"", ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You! the complete 1st and 2nd seasons"", ""Jonny Quest the complete first season"" and ""Wacky Races the complete series"" to send Warner Home Video a message that we want more Hanna Barbera classics released on DVD. EEP OPP ORK means BUY THIS SET!",1093305600,11,1407,4.579365079365079
2017987,5,B0001MZ7IC,This First Season Complete Series is the best for all ages! As I watched the first season myself (as a child) I had no idea of what the future would bring to the Space Age type cartoons! The Jetsons just stay with me even though it's been years!,1093305600,8,245,4.125
2017988,4,B0001MZ7IC,"While I was too young to ever see this show in prime time, it was a staple of afternoon cartoons while in my adolescence. This package which contains 24 episodes, plus some extra material, and is beautifully put together.  From the cover art to the full brilliant color of the discs and inserts, the show has never looked better.  Perhaps this is because I remember seeing it on our black and white television in the 1970's!

One aspect of the show was just how much set in the 60's it really is, despite the ""future"" concept.  Watching it now, one can see ""Beach Boys"" and other 60's California influences throughout.  The 60's influenced jazz music that plays in nearly every episode is a huge highlight though.

The Jetson's are also famous for presenting the concept that with improvements in technology our lives would have more leisure time.  Witness George Jetson lamenting the grind of ""these three hour work days"".  Also note his frequent complaining of having to ""push a button all day long"".  Obviously this aspect of the future has not been a reality.  However many other things presented in the show including wall sized and flat screen televisions, video telecommunications, and other gadgets, are available today but were dreams 40 years ago.

If you are at all a fan of the show, even for nostalgia purposes, then this is a great set to have.  Nothing but praise for the way they put it together for DVD.  I would have liked more bonus materials, including the commercials and other promotional clips, but the episodes themselves are much longer than I remember due to the fact that they are restored to the original length.  The color and picture quality is near perfect. Well done.",1093046400,20,1699,4.7542662116040955
2017989,5,B0001MZ7IC,"The 60's Hanna-Barbera cartoons were definitely better than anything you find nowadays on Saturday mornings! The Flintstones, Jonny Quest, and especially, the Jetsons! I've noticed, as I had gotten older, that there was quite a bit of humor directed towards adults in cartoons, like the Jetsons, that was quite oblivious to me as a child. One example that immediately comes to mind: George & Jane trip to ""Las Venus""! The hotels: ""The Supersonic Sands"" and ""The Flamoongo""...and appearing in Las Venus: ""Dean Martian"". But sorry to say that when I would come across one of the 60's episodes a few years back, I could tell many had been edited. What a shame!",1092700800,12,657,4.875
2017990,4,B0001MZ7IC,"I was glad to get this set and my son and I have really enjoyed watching the episodes.  Some I haven't seen for years!  Only complaint about the set is that they included the title cards on each episode that were inserted in the 1980s when the show was put back into syndication.  These weren't in the original airings back in '62.  Also, like on their Flintstones and Jonny Quest sets, Warner Bros. used the exact same ending credits for every episode.  Although it doesn't take away from the content of the episode, it's a big deal for me as I like to see who did certain voices, etc.  Besides those two things, it's a great set and worth the price.",1087776000,4,651,4.338842975206612
2017991,5,B0001MZ7IC,"I remember watching the Jetsons during its one and only prime time season on ABC way back in the early sixties. At the time I was also a big fan of the Flintstones and I loved comparing the inventions on the two shows. I remember Elroy watching a TV on a wrist band. The Watchman has made that a reality. I remember Judy watching a concert on a TV screen that took up an entire wall. The home entertainment center made that a reality. Many other futuristic ideas have also made it into our lives.
Even though I hadn't seen many of the episodes since the early sixties, I still remembered them. My favorites were the first one when Rosie the robot hits Mr. Spacely with her pineapple-upside down cake, the coming of Astro the dog and the show when George is shrunk down to size.
The images are clear and the sound is excellent. The jazz background music still excites me. My only complaint is that the episodes are preceded by a storyboard from when the shows were packaged with new episodes. I like things authentic, so the adding of a storyboard showing a character who didn't exist in the original first season of episodes bothered me for a second or two. But as soon as the episode starts, all is forgiven.
These shows are classics. Each episode brought back memories and brought a smile to my face.
With the Jetsons, Flintstones and Johnny Quest out on DVD, my cartoon wish list has been wonderfully diminished. Bring on Magilla Gorilla!!!!!!!",1086825600,78,1447,4.547892720306513

2017993,5,B0001MZ7IC,"The animated TV series, ""The Jetsons"", represented a space-dwelling ""flip side"" to the popular cartoon ""The Flintstones"".  Fred and Wilma Flintstone's antics were set in the Stone Age, with no modern conveniences (like, say, brakes on their bottomless automobile ... LOL!). While life with George Jetson and family is just the opposite -- taking place in the future, with a myriad of handy futuristic-looking gadgets and toys and flying cars.
I love the Jetson's ""food-a-rac-a-cycle"", which is a cool device that instantly dispenses about any type of food you could imagine.  Just press one button, and you've got an instant steak dinner.  Now THERE'S one modern convenience I'm sure every 21st-century housewife wouldn't mind having in their kitchens today!  Of course, the darn thing was always breaking down, or spitting out the wrong meals, or something of the sort, to drive George crazy!  But that was part of the fun -- seeing George in a frantic or stressed-out state.
There are 24 episodes of ""The Jetsons"" included in this deluxe and very attractive 4-Disc DVD boxed set from Warner Home Video.  These episodes are all from the 1962-1963 debut season of the animated series. Which, in my view, is actually the ONLY season from what could be termed the ""Original"" series of ""The Jetsons"".  The series was revived more than two decades later, in 1984, with another 42 episodes produced and aired during the 1984-1985 TV season. And the show was resurrected yet again two years later, with an additional 9 ""Jetsons"" episodes airing in September and October of 1987.
These two later versions of the series did a good job (IMO) of re-establishing the link with the original '62 shows and format.  The character drawings and voices changed very little (if I remember correctly) from the original version to its subsequent 1980s sequels -- unlike the ""Jonny Quest"" cartoon series, which was almost totally changed (in style, voices, and appearance of the characters), and for the worse IMO, when it was revived in 1987, after 22 years off the air.
But I still favor these first-season (1962-'63) ""Jetsons"" programs over the '80s episodes. This ""original"" series had a unique ""flavor"" and style all its own, and some great music and sound effects to accompany the stories.
This classy-looking DVD set gives us first-rate digital transfers for these 24 TV episodes, with very clear and colorful Full-Frame (1.33:1) video, and solid sound -- derived via the four disc's very ample 1.0 Dolby Digital Mono soundtracks (English only). The episodes are presented in full, uncut, unedited form (as far as I can tell), with each show sporting a healthy running time of a little more than 25:30!
The DVD Menus are fun and lively. We're greeted by the Jetsons' rousing opening theme music once a disc is loaded up into the player. From the Main Menu, there's access to the various Sub-Menus -- Episode Selections, Special Features, Languages/Subtitles, and a ""Play All Episodes"" option. These discs contain three different subtitle choices: English, French, and Spanish.
The packaging is colorful and very attractive, and replicates the same box style that also adorns other products in this same line of ""Hanna-Barbera Golden Collection"" DVD boxed sets.  The front cover offers a classic ""Jetsons"" image that is actually a ""two-sectioned"" (semi ""3-D"") picture -- with the inner section of the case providing the uncolored ""pencil"" drawings. When the innards of the case are slid into the ""color"" outer cover, the full, luminous effect of the image is completed.  Nice design.
In lieu of a multi-page booklet for this release, Warner Home Video has (in essence) placed the contents of any such paper enclosure directly onto the ""panels"" of the inner cardboard ""Digipak"", with each panel of the case displaying info for one of the discs. There are episode titles, trivia, and many nice pictures included on these inner fold-out sections of the packaging. These episodes don't have any ""Chapter"" stops, however.
BONUS FEATURES INCLUDE ....................
>> Two episode Commentary Tracks by Janet Waldo (the voice of ""Judy Jetson"") -- For the episodes ""Rosey the Robot"" and ""A Date With Jet Screamer"".

>> ""The Jetsons: The Family of the Future"" -- This short featurette takes a nostalgic look back at the series, and includes interview clips with show creators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Length -- 8:42.
>> ""Nuclear Family Album"" -- This text-based bonus offers up five character bios from the famous 21st-century cartoon family (including one for dog Astro). You can access these short bios one at a time, or all at once via the ""Play All"" selector. Total run time = 2:42.

Warner Brothers really hooked a line with this title when they snagged the Hanna-Barbera library and this DVD boxed set just adds one more quality choice to family home entertainment.
Wtih an element of science fiction and a twist of comedy, it's a wonder why this series wasn't released before now. With all of the violence that exists in entertainment television, these shows have always been the perfect entertainment tool for our children.

8014971,4,B0001MZ7IC,"The discs come in a folding cardboard and plastic contraption, but it's sturdy and well constructed. The discs play fine.

It was a nice trip down memory lane, but the show was much more enjoyable when I was a kid. Jonny Quest was my all time favorite show that I remember watching when I was a kid. These shows are as good as Twenty First century sci-fi shows like 3 2 1 Penguins! and Miles from Tomorrowland.

I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction. Westworld and Outlander are a couple of my current favorites.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,1835,5.313793103448276

8014978,3,B0001MZ7IC,"Disappointing. This is not the original series as broadcast. It appears to be the packaging done for the 1980's, so the famous closing credits with George walking Astro on the treadmill are missing, and the print quality is only so-so. It's a complete collection of episodes at a good price, and that's the best that can be said about it.",1505347200,,338,4.65
