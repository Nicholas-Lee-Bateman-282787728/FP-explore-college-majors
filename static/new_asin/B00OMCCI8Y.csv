_________________________________________________

In a film that explores racial stereotypes that leads to a controversial Halloween party thrown by privileged white students at an Ivy League campus, leads a group of black students to act. The film is helmed by first time director Justin Simien who takes on this comedy about a student named Sam who has a radio show titled Dear White People on campus. When she wins an election for Head of Housing, her personal attitudes towards those fortunate comes to the forefront. As anger rises amongst the different groups, it leads to a party that crosses the line and revelations to how racial stereotypes continues in a post-racial society.

Seen only a few times in theaters, the trailer suggested a comedy that follows a group of students who point out the differences between black and white. However, after watching the film it becomes clear that theres more here then one may expect. As funny as the movie is at times your also introduced to serious themes of racism that still exists in America. The main lead we follow is Samantha, played by Tessa Thompson, who exploits the wrongs of whites and leads many to believe thats how she really feels towards white people. It felt genuine to watch her performance as she honed in as a revolutionist or a combatant against those who keep her and the black people down. By the end, it comes clear of why her beliefs are fueling her actions and is touching.

We also follow a group of black students; including Troy Fairbanks (Brandon P. Bell) who loses his seat as Head of Housing to Sam. Hes in a relationship with the school presidents daughter, Sofia, whos white and creates conflict when Sams election turns attitudes about cross-racial relations onto each other. Troy is also following his fathers footsteps who happens to be the Dean of campus. When Troy gets involved with a prestigious group who look to turn the tables on Sam he loses sight of whats really going on and creates conflict within himself. We also see Teyonha Parris as Coco Conners who likes white men. As she arrives on campus shes quick to realize that the culture on campus is different then what she expected. Coco also looks to be discovered and become famous as an actress.

The film does a great job at exploring the different issues of race and has awesome performances by the actors involved. With problems arising it amounts to a party that catches the attention of not only the school but asks the question of how far weve come in approaching racially charged events. There are different perspectives by different groups in the film. Interestingly enough, Sam has a love interest in Gabe as her boyfriend. Gabe (Justin Dobies) happens to be white and brings into question her beliefs and why shes acting out in a way that isn't her true self. I thoroughly enjoyed this side of the story because we see an interracial relationship that does show how far Americas come when it deals with race. Weve become more socially acceptant of different backgrounds dating other backgrounds and more so today then there was 20 years ago.

Theres a good amount of satire in the film that Justin Simien brings up and in many instances are true. However, as ambitious he is in trying to bring about a film based around race, his focus tends to lose itself and inevitably weights down the subject matter. Some of it is heavy-handed and when the party is shown towards the end of the film your left to think how it got to this point. Even in the character of Sam, at some point she reflects back at what she started and shows somewhat of a change of heart. And because we follow a group of people who aren't all that well developed it makes the movie feel crowded with noise rather then making a connection to the events taking place.

Even though the vision isn't clearly thought out it does manage to be entertaining enough to invoke discussion and laughter about the stereotypes that are typically seen with race. Simien comes close to being a combatant towards racism as many of the characters encounter conflicts for a majority of the time. Tessa Thompson and Brandon Bell give amazing performances along with the rest of the cast, some more than others. All-in-all an interesting film with an entertainment value that will make somebodys day.",1414800000,4,4368,4.771164021164021
6756007,3,B00OMCCI8Y,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Dear White People' is first time writer/director Justin Simien's clever and provocative take on how young black students cope with the issue of assimilation on the majority white (fictional) Winchester University campus. The title refers to a radio show hosted by Sam White (played by the excellent Tessa Thompson), a militant student, who delights in slinging bon mots at the collective white student body.

She comes up with witticisms such as ""Dear White people: the minimum requirement of black friends needed to not seem racist has just been raised to two."" And then tops it off by adding, ""Sorry, but your weed man, Tyrone, does not count."" Other sharp-tongued epithets include: ""Dear White People, dating a black person just to piss off your parents is itself a form of racism,"" and ""even if Obama cured cancer, white people would still be enraged with him. And he's only half black.""

Sam and her Black Student Union supporters are not always averse to being critical of black cultural icons such as Tyler Perry: ""Can we have movies with, you know, characters in them instead of stereotypes wrapped in Christian dogma?"" And Sam isn't always who she appears to be: although a self-proclaimed bebop aficionado, someone outs Sam for having Taylor Swift on a hidden playlist in her computer--she blurts out: ""And I was so careful."" What's more, her white boyfriend, an RA in the dorm, is kept hidden from her BSU pals.

Simien is less successful with some of the other characters as they're not fleshed out as well. Sam's rival Troy and his Dad, Dean Fairbanks, have a pretty traditional father-son conflict, over the son's plans for the future. Then there's Colandrea 'Coco' Conners (the anti-Sam) who's changed her name to 'Coco' because Colandrea sounds too ""Ghetto."" She's trying to up her profile with a producer who's looking for actors in a potentially new reality show he's created; and showing up at a 'African-American themed' party (put on by the obnoxious University President's son, Kurt) is all part of her plan for upward social mobility. Insensitivity seems to run in the family, since Kurt's father, President Fletcher, declares that racism no longer exists in America, except maybe against Mexicans! But these one-liners are not enough to create, dynamic, multi-dimensional characters.

Finally, there's the ultimate outsider, the black and gay Lionel who angles his way in at the student satirical newspaper, Pastiche, in order to cover black student life on campus. Lionel doesn't fit in with the Black Student Union (they're not crazy about his homosexuality) and the white kids run their fingers through his Afro as if he's a child (one female student tells Lionel that he's black but only ""technically"").

The main plots in the film involve the University's desire to desegregate the traditional black residence hall which Sam is determined to prevent. Through some kind of computer chicanery, Sam is elected president of the residence hall, defeating Troy.

The climax occurs when Lionel flips out at the 'black-themed' party thrown by a gaggle of insensitive white students dressed up in black face. After trashing the room, including expensive audio equipment, Lionel and others are brought before an administrative hearing. Sam is tongue-lashed by the University President but the Residence Hall remains all-Black. Sam seems to have misgivings at getting too political and it appears she'll be moving off-campus next semester.

I'm not sure if Mr. Simien is more interested in proffering an angry lecture about race relations disguised as comedy or truly delivering a well-aimed social satire. Maybe he's achieved both. See Tessa Thompson for her performance alone--she steals the show. White people may feel uncomfortable with many of her characters' diatribes but considering that black people have been the subject of humiliating put-downs from whites, since the time of slavery, it's understandable that that a reaction formation would be in order: to maintain self-esteem and the upper hand in conversation, a vocabulary designed to facilitate a 'comeuppance' toward whites, appears predictable amongst many black people. On the other hand, assigning collective responsibility (particularly due to the ""sins of the fathers""), is a strategy that might be self-satisfying but self-destructive at the same time.

Mr. Simien has written a clever script with many great lines. Nonetheless, in the future, he needs to pay more attention to developing his characters a bit more, along with upping the stakes, when it comes to the plot.",1414627200,13,4607,5.206477732793522

As the movie opens with the ""PROLOGUE"", we are introduced to a fictional Ivy League college where Samantha ""Sam"" White (who is African-American) is doing her radio show, offering hints to ""Dear White People"" about dealing with African-Americans. We get to know several other African-American characters, including Troy, who is running for re-election as President of a House, and Lionel, who is vying for a spot as a writer on the student newspaper (he is to do a profile of Sam). To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the feature debut of writer director Justin Simien (who is African-American). Kudos to Simien for even daring to walk into the minefield that is the topic of racism and race relations in today's America. That does not mean his movie is without faults or shortcomings. At times the movie is funny (a voice-over describes Sam as ""if Spike Lee and Oprah had a pissed-off baby"", ha!), but at times I couldn't figure out whether a comment voiced by one of the characters was meant by Simien as a parody or not: when Sam gets into a discussion with the Dean of Students, himself African-American, who calls her radio show racist, Sam responds with indignation ""racist? black people can't be racist!"" and then goes on to explain why. The movie is divided into chapters (starting with the Prologue, then movie on to ""Show + Tell"" (where Sam shows a shortie called ""Rebirth of a Nation"" (as a response to 1915's ""Birth Of a Nation"", just watch!), ""Change of Plans"" etc. It all leads up to the final climax of the movie, which is quite haunting and daunting. There are a number of interesting performances in the movie. For me the ""breakout"" performance was from Tessa Thompson, in the role of Sam.

""Dear White People"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Saturday evening screening where I saw this at, was very nicely attended. It looks like this movie may stick around for a while in the theaters. Bottom line: ""Dear White People"" is a daring movie that makes some interesting comments about racism and race relations in today's society. If we are lucky, it may even lead to a meaningful further public discussion about it. If you have a chance to check out ""Dear White People"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or on DVD/Blu-ray, I'd encourage you to do so and draw your own conclusions.",1414195200,3,2535,4.69438202247191

6756011,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Dear White People"" (USA, 2014)

1. This brave, thoughtful firecracker of a movie sits right on the nexus of racism, classism, and homophobia. It opens a Pandoras Box of issues and identities in contemporary society.

2. It is set in a mostly white, success-obsessed Ivy League college, and follows four black students as they try to figure out what they want from life - and what life wants from them.

3. Each of the four main characters are well-played and embody various perspectives of young black culture: Samantha is a hell-raising protester. Troy is the guy that has it all made - as long as he can be a trophy. Coco is the one that wants to be famous. But I think the best performance of the movie comes from Tyler James Williams, who plays Lionel, the black gay guy that cant seem to find his place anywhere.

4. The movie is kind of a hodgepodge of scenes at the beginning, as if the film doesnt know quite what it wants to be. But as it moves along, it begins to sort itself out.

5. The movie is really funny, both in a satirical way, and in a oh-no-they-didnt way. But its humor with a point, and the movie bites you while you're laughing.

6. While the movie is told mostly from the black perspective, it doesnt let anybody off the hook. First-time writer/director Justin Simeon knows his stuff, and is perfectly willing to aim some jabs squarely at the black community.

7. The movie as a whole isn't quite as coherent as perhaps it could have been, but that can be forgiven when you consider what Simeon is trying to do. And there are some amazing individual scenes that have both the guts and sensitivity to push the topic way past the level of polite conversation.

8. The movie raises more questions than it can possibly answer. It actually doesnt answer any of them, but thats ok. Its function is not to solve the problems, but to make sure we can all admit they're there. The real brilliance of the movie is not just in its ability to illustrate the frustrating, vague tensions between the races, but in its ability to show the frustrating, vague, symbiosis of the races.

9. This is a rare movie that I like more and more each time I think about it. Its not perfect, but its important, and necessary. When it comes to the culture wars, this movie is going to leave a mark.",1414195200,75,2323,4.434272300469484

6756013,3,B00OMCCI8Y,"How many times have you heard some fool say ""We have a black President so racism must be over""? How many stories have we seen in just the last couple of years about white people throwing black-themed parties full of insulting racial stereotypes? No other film came with more pre-festival buzz than Justin Simien's debut feature, Dear White People, particularly amongst the black community expecting a blistering new voice similar to a Spike Lee. There's no doubt Simien has a lot to say about race relations in a supposedly post-racial America, but a lack of focus on the core issues and a ponderous script muddle any message to today's young black generation.

A wannabe taking many of its cues from Spike Lee's School Daze, the film aims to be a scathing, satirical examination of race relations in the Obama era, set against the backdrop of a posh Ivy League university. A heightened aggression permeates the grounds of fictional Winchester University; think Higher Learning meets P.C.U.; thanks to a new randomized housing policy that threatens the predominantly black Armstrong-Parker House. Samantha (a ferocious Tessa Thompson), is a ""black power"" radical stoking the fires with a controversial radio show called ""Dear White People"". It's there that she throttles up the tension with quippy verbal put-downs like ""Dear white people, the amount of black friends required not to seem racist has just been raised to two."", or ""Dear white people, dating a black person just to piss off your parents is a form of racism. An over-crowded cast of characters represent all sides of black society, which much like School Daze are constantly at war. The antithesis of the militant Sam is rich kid Troy (Brandon P. Bell), the classic non-threatening black guy who tries to be friends with all sides. He's the president of Armstrong/Parker and seeks to make his father (Dennis Haysbert) happy by climbing the social ladder and maintaining a relationship with his white girlfriend. There's also aspiring reality star Coco (Teyonah Parris), a weave-wearing fame seeker looking to hook up with the white trust-fund kids, and squash Sam in an effort to get more followers for her YouTube show. All of this is seen through the eyes of gay journalist Lionel (Tyler James Williams), a true outsider amongst perceived outsiders who can't find a place where he and his giant afro can fit in.

Simien's script is at its funniest when at its most confrontational, touching on a number of keen, pointed observations on the subtleties of racism. Tackling issues of prejudice in politics, affirmative action, and the abundance of insulting Tyler Perry movies. The megaphone for most of this is Sam, who struggles with identity while hiding behind an Angela Davis attitude in an effort to please her followers. Through her the film touches upon casual racism perpetrated by unaware whites who think they are being open-minded when they say ""You're only technically black!"" to someone who doesn't fit the stereotype. A highlight has Sam finding racism in the movie Gremlins; breaking it down as white fear of blacks invading suburban America (the gremlins talk slang, are addicted to chicken, and get upset when their hair is wet).

The problem with Dear White People has nothing to do with the content, which tackles a number of hot-button topics and presents a diverse swath of African-Americans that we rarely see on the big screen. To the film's credit, it's not just an angry screed against white people, and all sides are shown to have their flaws and prejudices. In his debut feature, Simien puts all of his eggs into one basket when a complicated film such as this requires a narrower focus. While the dialogue often comes off as too clever by half and self-congratulatory, the real issue is that the film is unwieldy with stagnant subplots. Troy's attempts to get in good with an arrogant white faction aren't resolved satisfactorily, and another involving his father's feud with the university president goes nowhere. Perhaps most disappointing of all is the treatment of Lionel, whose sexual/racial confusion feels like an afterthought, even though his character best embodies Simien's central point that nobody fits neatly into any one label.

Dear White People doesn't quite have the same blend of fire and insight as Lee's early work, but it's bold enough to ask the tough questions and make you laugh at the answers.",1413504000,13,4410,5.028727770177839
6756014,4,B00OMCCI8Y,"This 2014 Seattle International Film Festival entry from the USA is a social satire about racial issues on a college campus. (This review was sent out to a few of you in May, 2014.) We focus on two of the houses that provide quarters for some of the students...one is mostly black and the other mostly white. We see undercurrents of race, drugs, intolerance, and sex, and we draw our own conclusions.

The Dean of Students and the President of the University attended school together; one is black and the other white. Appearances to the contrary, they are NOT equal.

Here's the cast:
  * Tyler James Williams (Lots of TV) is Lionel. I listed him first because he ultimately is the catalyst needed to address the issue. We see things through his reporter's eyes. Housing is his first problem...
  * Tessa Thompson (Lots of TV) is Sam, an opinionated talk radio host and student on campus. She runs for president of her house ...and wins!
  * Brandon P. Bell (Lots of TV) is our conformist Troy, son of the Dean and head of his house...but not for long.
  * Kyle Gallner (""Beautiful Creatures"") is edgy Kurt, a racist spark plug in his house...AND son of the university president.
  * Dennis Haysbert (Lots of TV) is the Dean. He wants more for his son Troy and is afraid of how he will appear to others.
  * Peter Syvertsen (Lots of TV) is President Hutchinson, proud of Kurt, despite how his son behaves, and is determined to prove his campus is NOT racist.

Justin Simien capably wrote and directed this involving story. The dialogue is almost too erudite, but I understand what he is doing. He makes it clear that intolerance cuts both ways.

I appreciated the soundtrack. Among other pieces, I heard ""Rites of Spring,"" ""Afternoon of a Faun,"" an excerpt from ""Carmen"" and one that is driving me crazy because I can sing it for you but I can't think of its name!

I think the bottom line point is that everyone is way more racist (and hypocritical, irrational) than they appear to be (and it covers white on black, black on white, black on black and white on white).  Anyone who bashes this as some liberal take down of whites people is not really paying attention (there is equal treatment to how blacks are not only self-racist on an individual basis but also how they are conditioned by society as well as are racist and racism-enforcing against other blacks....and much of the same can be said of the white characters).",1487030400,10,930,4.693251533742331

When they mentioned satire, this was satire taken to the extreme in how white people behave and makes it seem justified to commit acts of anarchy and generalize an entire race because a few individuals were being dicks. This film seems to make it okay for individuals to commit acts of anarchy so long as the means justify the end, but this just made it okay to bring back segregation. Overall this was an interesting satire, though one with many points I could not personally agree with, and it's sad that some of the actions seen in this film is very closely portrayed, but overall the film is well put together and was very dramatic despite the political overtones.",1486944000,,738,4.590909090909091

I appreciate how well this film reflects the challenge of how intellectualizing and trying to understand issues of race is necessary but also confusing and can stall the process of speaking out or halting such language and behavior until it leads to an incident.

A similar event happened at my college during my senior year in 2006/2007. Happily that frat party did not result in a ""riot"" AND the college leaders did help to address the incident by cancelling classes to hold a race symposium weeks later. Nonetheless, anyone who imagines that race is no longer an issue in America only reveals that they either do not wish to or do not have to confront the subject.

The most telling aspect of this film and its attitudes is the end scene in which the black kids ""take action"" against the racist frat party. How do they respond to overtly immoral and bigoted behavior? By smashing personal property and ripping costumes off the party goers. In the past, I may have viewed this as a metaphor, however, in the current cultural climate of college campuses, this scene hits all too close to home.

6756104,1,B00OMCCI8Y,"Pure, unadulterated liberal nonsense about the poor, objectified, oppressed black people versus the mean, often stupid, highly racist white people.  White people are portrayed as ignorant oppressors, willful oppressors, or ambivalent oppressors.

When a white person does not understand weave, for example, there is something deeply hurtful and offensive about that.  How ridiculous can you get?  When discussing racism, the main character says that you cannot be racist against white-skinned people.  LOL.  Tell that to the Romans, who throughout history enslaved ""lesser peoples.""  All white-skinned.

The movie's writers seem not to have read the definition of racism from a dictionary.  And that is on purpose--because this movie promotes a new definition of black reactionary racism.  One in which only the black skinned can be offended.  One in which only white skinned people must pay for their ""racism.""  And that ""racism"" is defined by darker skinned people who resent white people's very existence, and do not respect them as equals.  How ironic is THAT?

Furthermore, white characters and the white public--we are instructed--want to be black, steal culture from blacks, etc.  Excuse me, but black Americans are American, making everything they contribute to society AMERICAN.  Instead of joy at the inclusion of black American cultural contributions, this movie calls it theft.  Racist theft, at that.

Movies like this do nothing to help race relations.  They inflame and antagonize.  They promote victim-hood and even violent crime.

Dear White People is a sad commentary on our times.  It is a cinematic expression of the revenge black racists feel they deserve.  For what exactly, they clearly do not know.  I am ashamed that Amazon promotes this, but--that said--it was an interesting watch.",1486684800,19,1808,5.420863309352518

6756142,4,B00OMCCI8Y,Ok not really my type of movie by the title but I was curious. It wasn't that bad really. I rated it 4 stars only because with the state of America at the moment I felt like I could have chosen a better time to watch it...but that was my error.

So inclusion racism will still existed it's just more passive now.",1480723200,,392,4.75

I wish the commercial had conveyed more of the content, I would have watched it before now. It had elements of Spike Lee style, but with a new contemporary take while preserving pervasive themes intact. The highlight of the film was the acting. This script was brought to life by a talented group of actors, many of which I was not previously acquainted with; which made it even better. I love new, GOOD actors. The writing was sharp and witty with understated undertones and nuances that filled out the silence. I just finished watching the film and honestly can't quite get all my thoughts together.

I like the post-contemporary approach tp all of the stereotypes white, black, hell even asian characters (archetypes) are washed in. I feel like this film adds to the discussion of our current society and if you are an individual capable of self reflection and awareness you can both cringe and enjoy how the scenarios are depicted in this film. I especially loved the character Samantha White, the writer was able to put all the 2D archetypes of black women into one character and as a result make her so complex! She's mulatto, sapphire, even a lil jezebel at times, but what I appreciate is the wit and self awareness she displays. I want to say he was successful with doing that for all of the main characters and I want to give him a BIG HUG for it. In the end 'Dear White People'  was just what my catharsis needed! I look forward to more films of this caliber.",1475971200,,972,4.430167597765363

6756221,2,B00OMCCI8Y,"Boring, cliche and old. I was hoping this would have been a laugh riot but it was far from even a chuckle. There were maybe 10 really funny jokes in the whole movie and you still have to hunt them down. The subject matter if handled right could have been the funniest thing ever. As it is this movie is one gigantic yawn. Where ""Dear White People"" tries to be edgey and confrontation it comes off as mean spirited racist. All but one of the s***e people are your stereotypical bigots. The movie has no subtly. The characters are not well developed at all.  One feels almost zero connection to any of the characters. All the characters represent a certain ""TYPE"" which limits the range of the story one can develop.  Actors playing for type don't get to add the tiny human qualities that often play against type. Some of the situations are just too weird to ever be real which would work if this was a screw ball comedy which it so isn't.

The movie ""Dear White People"" takes itself so seriously when it lacks the intensity and realism to be serious.  Yet conversely, ""Dear White People"" is no where near comedic enough to stand on its own as a comedy.  ""Dear White People"" is best described as a detailed exploration of many different stereotypes. ""Dear White People"" is borderline offensive to me because; my autistic brothers from an early age are white and I am black. Not all white people with money act like the morons shown in  ""Dear White People.""  I don't like  ""Dear White People"" because it suggests all rich white people are racist trash and I know from many personal experiences this is not so.

 ""Dear White People"" wants desperately to make a statement and it does make an ill informed racist statement that has only some merit. The fact that  ""Dear White People"" portrays race relations as a painful one demensional enterprise does a disservice to the rich robust nature of race relations today. Yes there are horrid vile racists in every ethnic group including black folk but on balance there are far more good people in every racial group else our society would have torn itself apart long ago.  I was hoping in vain that  ""Dear White People"" would be part of the solution in bettering race relations and all it does is add fuel to an already raging fire of hate.

I GIVE  ""Dear White People"" 2 STARS FOR TRYING TO BE MEANINGFUL & DROP THREE STARS FOR MISSING ITS GOAL HORRIFICALLY",1468454400,12,2398,4.544186046511628

6756251,2,B00OMCCI8Y,This movie had a great message and was entertaining at points. Didn't understand the guy with big fro just wondering around staring and never being able to deliver a point. If the movie intended on sending the message of the unification of the black people then the references to the TP movies ruined the point. To have the black artist speaking negatively of another black artist displayed signs of hypocrisy and jealousy.  There are ways to unite without trying to pull others down - but then that has always been the way.,1464566400,,524,4.695652173913044

6756259,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"When I first saw this film in Redbox I did not want to even spend the low price it took to rent it because I felt that if it was not funny I was going to be mad. Since it was available as part of my Amazon Prime membership I decided .... Why not.
 this is a droll and intellectual film with some parts  that make you think and some parts that might get a hearty laugh. Was it perfect? No. In some places, I would give it the same critique that you see in the movie (have to see the film.) It was worth if for  me to see the Gremlins and Star Trek references alone! I loved where all of the characters ended up and I thought it was well rounded. I never knew it was inspired by new events or I might have watched it sooner. Kudos to Tyler James Williams for the role that might land him superstar status (If you believe Illuminati conspiracy theories.)  My question  for Amazon Prime is why are there mainly goofy black films recommended after you see this?

6756268,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"If you Honestly look at American History You'll see nothing but lies,conflict, ignorance,racism.

One why did they start slavery in america!!!! Money ,Hate ,No Morals
UK outlawed. It was found to be extremely profitable ,billions in todays money ,Completely free labor Man ,woman,child . So when UK True MORALS and Christians ruled it was inhumane ,christian. The exiled ,rebellious criminals said hey america. Don't worry about natives ,we'll do the same as Africa 90 plus percent of diamonds came from Africa billions of dollars ,yet Africa has nothing to show all stolen,or avatar movie! Lie promise education, houses, medicine, missionaries,then start killing and taking all resources gold etc this has been admitted by USA watch pbs Great buffalo Slaughters how they killed over ten thousand buffalo close to extinction to starve natives, So after they took much of their land read what 49ers did during gold rush to natives! They needed to farm that land well being the lazy exiled Europeans they said hey let's call this america ,separate from Europe and start our own slavery,Real reason declared independence, they knew uk would not have slavery,civil war,native war,Mexican war etc. No compare Canada history never had any of those,so slaves would go there and Canada has better people less racism, crime,better health care,less serial killers,mass shootings as does Uk .

Two claim Africans enslaved themselves so why did you sail to Africa with chains,whips,guns,as well they did not speak English ,and you are saying you asked every man woman and child. So why were British constantly fighting and blocking american slave ships to free them.

Why start civil war if you honored their request for slavery ,why not honor request for freedom????? Instead started civil war that killed hundreds of thousands,Makes no sense,So logically if that makes no sense ,its all a lie. Look up actual pictures of slave trade balcks whipped and chain. Do not see any Africans selling.

Read Indian relocation act ,Slavery act,Small pox given to natives, Tuskegee experiments giving syphilis to blacks while  lying saying it was medicine. Then watch as it literally destroys the brain and they unsuspectingly transmit it through contact and sex.

Read about their witch hunts burning their own at stakes

Mexican war
Assasiantion of four presidents

Bombing of black churches since 1800's domestic terrorism Selma church,Oklahoma bombing ,Atlanta Olympics. Rosewood,black wall street any minority towns they'd bomb and burn down and wonder why there's violence.

Look up or watch Mississippi burning  The police shot three civil rights workers two white from NY one black and buried alive.

Watch when king preached and practice peaceful demonstrations and were met by violent opposition ,mostly police,firemen water hoses,conservative racist and dogs. Plenty of video of all this. So again who refused peace whites.
Ask any historians what are most tragic events in usa history all top ten or more by whites and I loved Kennedy brothers, Lincoln and some other whites. Watch Greatest Speech ever by Robert Kennedy on You tube Listen closely then you'll see why the M.O was changed for his death. Truth out his own mouth so he was eliminated. Watch what JFK said a week before his demise about the plot to enslave. Listen to Lincoln speech then king all killed by whites who set tone for violence in america.

Watch any documentary by Michael Moore,any pbs special about any of these subjects especially those by Ken Burns. Watch the mob with bill kurtis on american justice.

These all produced written made by good people mostly white who are for truth. Even actor John Wayne said it was OK to take native land because they were selfish( That was most of his generations and founding thugs attitude) Yet California was always Mexican San Jos ,San Diego does it sound English no. Starved rock look it up.

Fact is they started this mess no slavery no invading Africa Look at south Africa,no Mexico can war. If they obeyed British none of this would be. They learned and outlawed all of oppression and slavery. So don't complain now. Fact is no matter your excuse Christians people with morals don't enslave ,even if they supposedly asked and the children????  So I guess newt Gingrich white conservative arrested for prostitution OK since he VP possible choice. Dennis Hastert who he replaced molested boys paid them off and just sentenced. Who has most serial killers in USA,not minority,how about mass shootings not minority,even domestic terrorism look it up. How about state with most gun deaths always hear about Chicago, well Illinois not even on top 20 list Alaska number one.

I wrote this ,when I was just reading reviews to see if I wanted to watch 90 percent are people conservative screaming racist rants,obviously most only wanted to instigate so allow me to retort.  All of this is in library of congress and admitted by us government, Also plenty of videos historical and pictures to support all of my facts. Name sources for yours like Africans selling Africans still no pics or reliable proof why? Natives already dying and slaughtering each other so you just moved in and finished them?? Proof??? Pictures? Look at last public execution circus executions where blacks lynched while they watched and enjoyed cotton candy and popcorn. Fun for the whole twisted family,Read George stinney Jr case electrocuted by Carolina government at 14 not allowed lawyer or family. For crime he did not commit just posthumously pardoned 70 years later. Read declassified FBI files of flooding black and minority neighborhoods with drugs. Read what they did to any non minorities who supported justice like Jane seberg  actress.

Name and proof where minorities started this against whites or verifiable casea of mass lynchings, slavery,executions of whites by Africans I'm waiting??! Pictures ,video,FBI or government files and admissions will do. Thought so none just garbage made up to justify your evil. Well for thousands of years elephants flew with their ears,proof pictures????? Just like your claims ridiculous

No one seems to be a ""good"" person, and while it's clear that white people as a whole have a lot to learn, a majority of them in the film come off as worse than the ""protagonists"". The plot lines (finally) come together with a decent close, but not before you've pondered about why you watched this film in the first place.

My Black Sisters...love who u love freely. We r so judged by our community when we date or fall in love outside of our race. The criticism only seems to be reserved for us! One of best friend's daughter said...like a truism...that the ideal relationship was between a white man and an Asian woman. Next was Black man and woman white.

6756460,4,B00OMCCI8Y,"I was not sure how I felt about this film until gave it more thought after viewing it. I was thrown a bit because James was not really the star. I thought he might play the Greek chorus role, narrating and summarizing what was happening as the movie progressed. While Lionel had some impact toward the end, it seemed that he was just another student whose experiences came to the forefront on occasion in the midst of other events. His actions at the party seemed tacked on rather than a depiction of actual anger. He seemed too detached up to that event to care that much. The scene that struck me the most was when Dean Fairbanks (Dennis Haysbert-""The Unit"") lectured his son. It was what he didn't say that was important. He told his son, in subtle terms, that hanging out and acting like the white frat boys would sink his ambitions. If Spike has written this speech, I believe he would have been more explicit. I believe Mr. Lee would have said, in no uncertain terms, that those ""white boys"" had their futures set for them as long as they didn't blow it completely. The path to the executive suite, law firm partnership or high political office was already theirs as long as they followed the tried and true path set for them by their parents. College was a just a step along the way. Graduation (not high grades) is all that is needed.  He didn't tell him explicitly that these same people would be the ones leaking information about his past if he ever came in competition with them. Their families and friends could protect them; his could not. He would have told him that he was mistaken to believe that he was equal by merely attending the same school. That soliloquy and what it suggested comprised some of the movies' best lines.

The party scene, offensive enough on its own, took on new meaning during the credits, which reported that parties like this one were occurring today at the nation's college campuses. A sad indictment that informs us the notion of racial equality is still a pipe dream in the US of A, generations from fruition. The children have, unfortunately, been ""taught well.""

I was looking for ""School Daze"" set on a majority white campus. It was something less, but thought-provoking just the same.",1454544000,2,2233,4.605527638190955

What is it that black people don't get? BLACK family, is the number one thing fought against by this system, why? Because the black family is the microcosm of structure. The micro prototype of the entire nation as a whole. It's the image thereof. Black man running the house, the wife ordering everything, and the children and the children being raised to continue this organism. What do you do if you hate a people and want to destroy them as a race, and you don't want to outright do it with violence? You attack those cell, I.E family because then the entire nation as a whole will die. You inundate the organism with things that will eventually kill it like: homosexuality, drugs, weapons, amorality, race mixing etc. You dilute the gene pool, you have them get high and die from overdose, kill each other over ego or stop them from procreating entirely by means of homosexuality. That's an exceptionally effective way to force the extinction of race without showing your hand too much.

A line in this movie rephrases DuBois's philosophy of art in a character's criticism of Tyler Perry's films, and then the film goes on to reach for its own greatness. We see generation X in an elite Ivy League college trying to find its way with the aid of technology in a kind of zany self reflective pastiche of their cyborgian struggle with race in America. I don't know who directed it or who edited it, but both editor and director are on their road to greatness ala John Ford. The trouble with black film lately, such as The Butler, and Straight outta  Compton is that they were poorly edited and so they were great stories poorly told. The only glitch I saw in this movie was a word used by the student who wants to be a reality TV star. She uses the word ""skinneded""  instead of ""skinned"", and while I don't know if the double D is a grammar rule in AAVE, she wouldn't have used it since she would have rejected Ebonics, or somebody would have connected it to her upbringing in ""the hood"".

This was not a film that was trying to solve all problems about racism and tell all white people 'this is you,' and it would be a mistake to go into watching it thinking that.

The content however hits all the points that all White people and People of Color need to see, feel and hear. From understanding White privilege to getting a felt sense of the effects of internalized racism, this movie will surely make you think.

For People of Color, the validation of our experience is like a breath of fresh air. Let's support one another, unite and fight.

For White people, when you start to feel uncomfortable, this is the opportunity to reflect and grow.

For those who are ""Color Blind,"" it's important to educate yourself that racism is alive and well and that White people continue to benefit from systems of oppression. To see color is respectful to another person's experience. To not see color, makes you feel safe and wipes out the pain and the reality that a Person of Color continues to face adversity because of their race i.e. get paid less doing the same job, not get hired, not even given a chance to apply because application gets thrown out because their name is too ""ghetto,"" This continues to happen.

The tongue on this film was planted so far through the cheek that I was surprised everyone wasn't speaking in massa and mammy type terminology. To call it low brow would be demeaning to low brow culture. The acting and cinematography were nearly as dry as the script and barely on par with the ""after school special"" style production of the 1980s. This movie did not offer keen insight, scathing criticism or even valid commentary on race in America.

The end of the film has one of the characters decides that they aren't but the rest of them still see it that way.

But the movie was mostly about college aged students struggling with their own black identity, where they fit in. ""Dear White People"" is the name of a blog and the protagonist is the author of the blog. The trailer and the title misdirect people - and - probably kept some people away that would have benefitted from seeing it and probably enjoyed it.  Yes, racism and racist behavior occurs, as do issues of homophobia, exploitation, parental rebellion, privilege, etc.  Race in America is complex, and, while there is much finger pointing back and forth, all races need to start in the mirror.  That's this movie's main message (at least that's what stood out to me).  I want to watch this movie again, as I suspect there is a lot of depth in the messages.",1449014400,,990,4.533707865168539

6756964,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"I have been wanting to see this movie for awhile, and it did not disappoint! I know it's listed as a comedy, but I agree with some of the other commentaries: it's a coming of age story. I really appreciated the dedication to the development of the four main characters. Their ideas, opinions, struggles, and desires were revealed subtly and then fleshed out more thoroughly as the story unfolded. That part was really beautiful.
  I was a little disappointed in the depiction of most of the white characters. Pretty much all of them were depicted as ignorant and racist. Maybe that was intentional, and maybe that seemed authentic to the writers/producers. Personally, it's the only thing that made it seem less realistic for me. I know white people like the party boy who gets away with everything thanks to Daddy's money, but I also know white people who are authentically kind to everyone and appreciate diversity. Of course, as I'm writing this I am recalled to the historical photos of racist frat parties shown during the credits. So I guess it's not that surprising that the white people depicted in the film are someone's collective impression.
  Anyway, this was an excellent film. I'd recommend it for sure!",1446940800,,1217,4.8647342995169085

I can almost guarantee that the majority of the bad reviews for this movie come from white people. Definitely not a surprise, seeing as the movie is labeled dear white people and is giving a description of how blacks feel at PWIs.

Maybe another reason for their confusion was because the film seemed to be using the setting of today (social media, etc) to make it 2000-teen relateable but it seemed it was written by a person who fell in the 35-42 age range because of the references and topics. On the other hand older individuals were confused because they grew up with the black-exploitation films that were more in your face and did not have too much to ""interpret"" or the Madea-loving quasi-reiterations (Tyler Perry in his earlier films navigated both worlds and represented both well enough).
This film was more cerebral and was over the head of those maybe thinking it would offer more belly-laugh comedy (b/c of the title).  But maybe that was the intention?",1446681600,,955,4.712574850299402

6757106,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"I think where people have a problem with this movie is that it actually portrays people of color as, well, people, as multi-layered, as imperfect, as battling their own demons. There is no ""protagonist"" because this isn't a fairy tale - this is real life. This movie is excellent at portraying what POC go through in surviving daily life. It's really a taste though and deals with a small segment of upper middle class but it is important as it highlights where the most racism is - the place that it's most overlooked. More racial violence happened in the North than in the South post-Civil War because people didn't consider themselves racist.

Why are we stock with black as being the victim of circumstances. We need to move pass the past. I believe we are in a new World. A black person as myself will never one day become white. So instead of labeling yourself and Letting Racial injustice cloud your mind. Take the good in you and explore that. Everyday one turns the TV on there is that phrase that is never missing ""I'm black and I'm beautiful! "" so it's okay for a black person. To say that but it's an issue if a white person comes on TV and say ""I'm white and I'm beautiful! "" Hell's gate will be left open.
I believe we mistake the difference between  colorism and racism. There is only one race and it's the human race. So let's stop using being black as a handicap towards our goal.

6757143,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"""Dear White People"" was a candid and fascinating take on race relations in the U.S. and specifically how it plays out (hyperbolically) on an upscale college campus.

The story is largely told through the voices of black people, and although there's a protagonist and a love story, race touches on literally every facet of the plot.

While it's supposedly a comedy, the truth is it's not really any one thing. It's funny and clever without being buffoonish, and boy does it have sharp edges.

Prepare to see sacred cows skewered and ossified political stances broken down.

A light amount of humor, with a dash of semi-serious students, mixed with a larger showcasing of the individuals filled with their self-distaste, stirred with a group of self justified adolescents dropping the ""N"" word with minimal ""realistic reactions"".

6757254,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"This movie is called Dear White People (DWP) but it didn't feel like it was targeted at white people. The movie actually feels more targeted at Blacks than anybody else. Side note in case it matters to you: I am a Black American male - who experienced a lot of this during my own college education.

A group of four characters each exhibit the issues Black America faces. A black male who is gay and acts white to reach his goals and because of fear of rejection from the black community. A lighter toned black female who really just wants to touch people in a way that is moving and gets appropriated by a movement she is not sure she believes in. A darker toned black female who rejects the 'hood' stereotypes but is willing to sell it if necessary to have a successful life. A black male who is taught to be 'better' by a father who is controlling and thus can't be himself.

Maybe it is because I love math and science so much (engineer here), but I can't help but compare this movie to a common scientific technique. Often, for the sake of exhibiting a theory, the math and science community will extrapolate an idea to its extreme in the hope of showing the underlying trend. DWP felt that way to me. Exhibiting the common questions and issues that blacks today face in America in a way so extreme that you can't help but notice how close it is to reality. In a sense, DWP is so far away from reality that it appears overly stereotypical and satiric (hence a lot of the criticism this movie receives).

It was like they were cast from a television commercial.

6757268,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"Took my a long time to watch this movie even though I was interested in it... I think it was a really good coming of age story that deals with how one (in this case a black youth at an ivy league institution) sees him/herself in the white American society and among their peers as well as evaluates how one sees his/her peers (e.g. am i racists? am i bigoted? am i giving others a fair shot to be themselves?).  Being that I saw it more as a coming of age story, I don't think that it hit on very serious racial issues.  I think the characters in the movie did a good job portraying their struggles how identify and present themselves, as educated blacks, to main stream America. It is frustrating in America, as a black person, to feel as if non-black people see you first as the stereotypes shown in media.

I wonder if people that hated it or found it boring simply missed a lot of the quirks, if the advanced vocabulary went over their heads, or if they felt too uncomfortable seeing young white people being portrayed in an unfavorable, non-stereotypical light.  You will enjoy this movie or at least it will make you think about how you treat individuals based on race, if you are open-minded.",1444348800,2,1199,4.411764705882353

As shocking as the college 'black face' parties in America where, this film sets a tone of anger between races, building the wall higher rather than trying to trying to find a solution and teaching tolerance. Also, as with many first time feature writer/directors the characters were not fully dimensionalised and various story strands were under developed. I didn't really like or care about any of the characters and when the film was over I felt angered by it, rather than fulfilled, though I guess this was the point. Good performance by Tessa Thompson.

I understand the desire to get an ""R"" rating, but the use of the excessive curse words was distracting and took much from the theme.  I wanted to see character development, more intense development of the racial issues at the core, but what I got instead, was a lot of language and sexuality that did nothing to develop the story line.  I guess showing some nudity helps to get a more adult rating too.  These types of ploys to get a more adult rating just cover for poor writing and underdevelopment of the plot.  This movie needed to be given to a good script writer--one who knows how to develop a plot based on the actual elements that make great literature.  I watched this movie because my students suggested it, but I wasted time and energy on it.

6757390,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"A wonderful and very truthful portrail on the African American struggle in this current social environment. Do not forget that this movie is based off of true events. So some might say that this movie is fictitious and making up race issues, just to add conflict to the plot. However, this movie and the idea of this movie sprouted out of ""black parties"" that occurred on multiple different campuses  during the early 2000's. Speaking from an African American perspective the characters were very realistic. Expecially in living in a mostly Caucasian environment. There is a struggle internal and external struggle that every human being has to face, do fit in. And sometimes when you can't fit in you have to fight back or stand out. We are all struggling to find a place and our purpose. Especially on a college campus, when you're trying to figure out what you're going to do for the rest of your life. This is The struggle of a college student, the struggle of the young woman, the struggle of an African American person in a society that leans unfairly against African Americans. Movies are about conflict,  this one demonstrates internal external and overall theme of what it means to be accepted or not accepted. I feel this film is a wonderful example the study of black culture in the 2000's.  Anybody of any race should watch and take in the information and learn.

6757473,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"As a teenage black girl, I loved this movie. I could relate to almost every single thing Sam talked about because all the ""Dear White People"" statements were not just ways to target white people. They are not just out of the blue. In this generation, young teenagers experience way more than adults may think. Things that were said in this movie actually exist, wether you want to believe it or not. I live in a Surburban neighborhood and can not stress enough about how much I want to move just because I am tired of seeing little white kids staring at me because I am the only black girl living in the neighborhood. They stare at me as if they have never seen a black person in their life. White girls always want to know how I get my hair the way it is, like there is some kind of scientific way to do my hair. Then they always want to touch it and ask so many unnecessary questions. The questions they ask are all questions they would never go up to another girl of a different race and ask them; in other words, they would never go up to a white girl and ask her ""How long did it take to get your hair like that?"" This is a message to some of you who say this movie ""exaggerated"" a lot, or was a ""bit too much,"" please know that those pictures at the end of the movie are real pictures that were taken and put on the internet. They did not just appear out of nowhere for the director to put it there and make a ""big deal out of nothing."" Racism still exists today. The young generation, today, is stupid. So this movie is not exaggerating at all; it is the perfect portrait of this generation and racism put together.",1442707200,,1622,4.1687898089171975

6757475,2,B00OMCCI8Y,"Saying that I don't like it isn't quite right. It puts forth the very stereotypes that it would like to unravel. The acceptable black people all have lighter skin tone; the more militant black people have much darker skin. The ""hood"" look is perpetrated as normal for black people, while the journalist has to look like a white person to feel like he doesn't fit in. He is wearing plaid. He has a pronounced afro style haircut but even that is not like the ""acceptable but down with the cause"" hair styles worn by the acceptable black characters. The movie might as well be a Tyler Perry movie, the roles are so ridiculous. The best portrayal of a black man in media lately has been Freddy from House of Cards. It isn't that I want to see a black guy cooking ribs who has a questionable background; I want to see a man who happens to be black who has gravitas, pride, self-respect, and dignity and damn everyone else who cannot appreciate it. He stands apart no matter what, because he has chosen to rise above all of the stupidity of race relations and he did it by recognizing the dignity he has in himself, that he has given to himself through his choices to excel in both work and especially ethics. This movie does not celebrate the best in humanity, ethnicity not withstanding, because it does not appreciate or portray the dignity that all of us can have if we would choose it for ourselves..",1442620800,52,1399,4.46875

This movie was a joke. The people behind it obviously wimped out at the last minute which resulted in a confusing message/plot. It started out as a movie about how ""angry young black Americans"" were going to reclaim their culture by being outrageous and trafficking in tired stereotypes . . . projected upon the white students. When the tables were turned and the white kids did the same to prove a point it was supposed to be a sit down and realize what is going on moment. An adult intellectual moment that we all have our hang ups no matter what race and one is not any better than the other. But instead you saw black kids not stomping on people's heads and rioting but breaking up fights and the credits rolling with real images from real American universities throwing parties where white kids were in ""black face"". We are supposed to shake our heads and just become so somber and guilty I guess. LOL Just coddling and catering to the victim complex that seems to have firm planted itself in America. Conversation?

In the end, it left me feeling like there must be a lot of black people who must need counseling based on the bizarre behavior some of the characters, particularly the girl with the video blog rants.  It's almost as if there's a 'holier than thou' feel toward whites while by definition, if whites are being lumped together as one stereotyped group, all guilty of the same sins, then what... that isn't racist back the other way?  I don't know... I was expecting something else I guess.  Instead I just felt like (as a white guy) I found myself being lectured to for an hour and a half.  There weren't even that many particularly funny, or exciting, or poignant moments.  The story line was way too contrived and only once did I feel like there was a moment of truth when the girl asked if she should blame white people for wanting to dress up like blacks on Halloween for a little fun.  It's probably just me because I love politically incorrect stand up comedy and nothing tickles me more than self deprecating humor especially when it deals with stereotypes.  I think we'd all do well to learn to embrace our diversity and laugh at ourselves a little more.  And when people laugh at you, laugh with them... we're all pretty funny if we can just learn to realize how silly each of our cultures are, especially when seen from another races perspective.

The trailer makes this movie look like an outright comedy.  This is a lie.  Despite having comedic moments, this movie is neither a comedy nor a satire.  It is an exploration of what it feel like to be a black face in a sea of white ones.  It looks at how different individuals respond to and adapt to this problem; from those who choose to ignore it to those who never let anyone around them forget it.  The film masterfully teases out the nuances of how different individuals experience marginalization, how everyone encounters, understands, and responds to racism and aggression (both micro and overt) in different ways.

6757650,3,B00OMCCI8Y,"THE FILM: People are often limited by their own personal experience, and so I can't claim to know a whole lot about the many struggles that black people go through (as a white male). That being said, I firmly believe that we should treat one another as people regardless of what categorizations we dream up for ourselves. Putting things into categories can be useful, as it allows us to make sense of the world around us while also forming an identity for ourselves. Problems arise when we start assigning value judgments to said categories as a way to benefit some and denigrate others. Further still, making fun of one group (or more) based on stereotypes about that group is just plain insensitive. DEAR WHITE PEOPLE addresses some of these concerns, and attempts to do so in a satirical manner, but it lacks a cohesive voice and a big enough bite to really make an impact on the viewer, with the exception of a few scenes. Partially inspired by a number of racist college parties that made national news, this film had the potential to really dig to the root of issue in a bold and daring way. At least that's one would expect if you saw the trailers for it. However, the style and approach isn't as snappy as one would expect. The pacing is fairly lethargic, the narrative structure episodic, and most of the punchlines never make the impact they should as a result. Justin Simien also relies a little too heavily on the stereotypes he seems to be trying to subvert, which undermines the message a little bit. Also, a comedy is supposed to make you laugh and I rarely even chuckled. The most it did was make me uncomfortable and a little angry at the racism on display during the party scene at the end, which is probably the intended reaction. And even though this was inspired by events at prestigious colleges, having this set at such a place gave off a sense of elitism, i.e., I highly doubt that the experiences portrayed in this film would apply to most of the audience. All of this being said, I do have some positive things to say as well. The film was well-put together from a technical standpoint, and all of the performances were good. I only recognized a few of the actors, though. There was Tyler James Williams, more famous perhaps for playing a young Chris Rock on EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS, and Dennis Haysbert who's been a few movies I've seen and the State Farm commercials. They, and everyone else, did fine with the material they were given. And, for all of the faults one could find in the way it's presented, the characters were all well-developed. I also thought that the score, while contributing to the tone and feel that I personally didn't care for, after a while seemed appropriate giving where the film is set. There were also some nice artistic flourishes in various shots. What I thought was most effective in the film was the part in the end credits where it has pictures of the various parties that inspired the film. Overall, the film lacks the energy and the intensity of the trailer and, as a result, fails to make much an emotional impact. It also doesn't make any unique insights into racial identity. I guess the biggest thing for me is that my expectations weren't met in terms of the overall tone and feel of the film. It's well-made, to be sure, but quite dry.

THE EXTRAS: For an indie film that was partially crowd-funded on Indiegogo, there was actually a decent amount of supplementary material. The biggest thing is the ""Making Of"" documentary, which lasts for about 20 minutes. It has interviews with the cast and filmmakers, and clearly shows how important of a project it was to them. There was also a cool music video for a song that featured in the film. As with many films, irrespective of genre, there are deleted scenes and outtakes, although not that many. My favorite, however, was a series of short featurettes that have some of the humor that I wished had been in the film itself. Rounding things out are not one, but two, feature commentaries: one with the cast and director, and the other with just the director.

OVERALL: If I had to condense my feelings into a single word, it would be ""disappointment."" I was promised a sharp comedy by the trailer, but that's not what I got. Chalk it up to deceptive marketing, I guess. When I think about some more, this honestly worked best in that short and punchy trailer anyway. That's not to say that the message or observations are any less valid, but it didn't work for me on an entertainment level. Still, the special features are more than adequate and, in some cases, more entertaining than the film itself. Generally speaking, this is a film I probably should have rented on demand first before deciding to buy. I won't not recommend this, but just understand what you're getting into.",1437004800,,4796,4.614754098360656

6757665,4,B00OMCCI8Y,"Dear White People is a film I wish didn't need to exist, but once you take into account the true-life examples of white folks throwing blackface or black culture parties without fully understanding the racist implications involved along with the rather excellent point made by the films strongest character (Tess Thompson) in its final minutes, you realize just how badly its point of view is needed. However, the pigheaded antics of some frat boys and the indifference of a student body who said nothing aren't the only reasons for the film to exist; Dear White People bursts at the seams with examples of how every racial and ethnic segment of our society has a real problem with recognizing how deep the problems go. From reality television to Tyler Perry, both sides of the racial gap are doing their part to make things worse and exploit a culture for profit, and writer/director Justin Simien does a stupendous job of pointing out the hypocrisy flowing in either direction.

The Dean (Dennis Haysbert) and President (Peter Syvertsen) of Winchester University both like to think all is well on their Ivy League campus, but just below the surface racial tensions are beginning to boil. Just about everyone on the campus is in denial about something, whether its aspiring journalist Lionel Higgins (Tyler James Williams) who cant get past his own narrow stereotypes which prevent him from creating an identity for himself, social justice advocate Samantha (Tessa Thompson) who has built herself up as a crusader despite pieces of herself that identify with the system she rails against, Coco Connors (Teyonah Parris) whos torn between her desire to establish her identity as anything other than just another black student and the fortune promised by playing into the stereotype to possibly secure the lead in a new reality TV show to be shot on campus (by a TV producer played by Malcolm Barrett). Finally, theres the son of the dean (Brandon P. Bell) who wants to make his father happy by pursuing student government, but finds his plans thrown off by an election and the distraction of writing for Pastiche, the satire newspaper run by the Presidents bigoted son (Kyle Gallner)

Everywhere you look at Winchester University everyone is busy trying to be the person people think they are without paying any attention to who they want to be. The jumble of conflicting agendas comes to a head at the Pastiches annual party which has a rather unfortunate theme, making it just how clear the racial divide on the campus truly is.

On one hand, the identity crises faced by each of the characters in Dear White People is entirely normal and can be seen playing out on virtually every college campus across America. College is a time of transition and the discovery of who people really want to be after having spent high school worrying about who they needed to be to be popular, and that portrayal of college is one Dear White People hits perfectly. On the other hand, that alone doesnt make Dear White People unique, and instead its how the film builds up its different pieces, predictable and obvious or not, to create a perfect storm of racial and personal tensions that allows each character to have a moment (or two) of realization and gives the community of Winchester University as a whole a rather big wake up call.

Tessa Thompsons final scene with Dennis Haysbert, wherein a small but obvious twist is revealed, contains the fundamental message that Dear White People cant drive home enough: the most serious problem isn't that people do incredibly racist things like hosting race-themed parties, its that everyone just goes along with it under the banner of free speech. If racism was truly dead, as one of many tone deaf characters in the film and far too many real-life politicians claim, then a party like the one throne in Dear White Peoples third act could never happen. It would be canceled the second people received the invitations and cried out in protest.

That doesnt happen though, and so films like Dear White People are not only entirely on target, they're also unfortunately necessary.",1434499200,,4111,4.892395982783357

6757744,4,B00OMCCI8Y,"In his first feature film, director/screenwriter Justin Simien delivers an interesting satirical piece on race relations.  The setting is an exclusive, fictional Ivy League college called Winchester University.  One of the most popular, on-campus radio shows is called ""Dear White People"" which features non-stop lecturing by Sam White (Tessa Thompson from TV's ""Copper"" and the film ""Selma"").  Her focus as the title suggests is the way caucasians on campus interact with the minorities.  In some ways, her rants seem almost helpful, such as who can use the ""N""-word and who can't.  But sometimes it goes much deeper.

Sam is a bit of an enigma herself beginning with her white father and her last name.  She also has a white boyfriend or as she suggests, a f**k-buddy.  She is at odds with Troy (Brandon P. Bell) who is the son of the straight-laced Dean of Students (Dennis Haysbert).  And to really make things interesting, Troy dates the white daughter (Brittany Curran) of the school's president (Peter Syvertsen).  Issues become more heated when the black residence hall announces the results of the election for its president.  Surprisingly, Sam the firebrand is elected over the incumbent, Troy.  One of her first acts is to prohibit whites from eating there.  She also removes an odd-acting gay student named Lionel (Tyler James Williams from ""The Walking Dead"") who has struggled to be accepted anywhere on campus.

Simien keeps thing percolating throughout but also manages to interject large amounts of humor.  He also uses Sam's eloquent diatribes to deliver some well-intentioned points.  One of the better scenes in the film comes when Sam, an aspiring film student, shows her hilarious take on ""The Birth of a Nation.""  Recommended.

The Blu ray transfer includes a 1080p video resolution with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The digitally shot movie isn't going to get anybody excited regarding the look of the film.  It has an amber tint over most of the film, especially indoors.  At the same time there are no artifacts that I could see and the film is certainly more than watchable.  Clear and distinct.  The audio features a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is excellent.  Again, there's nothing to shout about as the movie is dialog driven with little opportunity to bring in the surrounds or the LFE channel.  Still the dialog is clear and properly focused.  Subtitles are available in English SDH and Spanish.  Here are the extras:

I counted 5 separate story lines trying to run parallel to one another while also trying to tell one over arching story. Shame, this movie could have been pretty entertaining otherwise.

6757769,4,B00OMCCI8Y,"Far more intimate, less stereotypical representations of young college people.  I in particular liked the various black & other 'non-Caucasian characters for their honest, constantly fluctuating personalities.  Far less Hollywood than a Spike Lee film which probably might have tried to explore similar subjects, but in the end,  by no means dull & in fact completely satisfying.  I could take a whole big dose of this.
Like others I first thought, been here before, and where's the humor I was expecting?
""Dear White People"" to dispel preconceptions is about one of those crazy college radio programs where students try to hit people with ideas they would never get on commercial radio.  The film is not a snarky letter to White people to laugh at their possible ignorance's, or for black people to chuckle at how goofy white people might be in their encounters with the sometimes awkward situations of race.
The final effect is in fact a bit charming & surprising.  The earnestness of a few young people to deal with normal conflicts of maturation & the attempts by a few to change the status quo makes for good story when put together with a notably talented director & actors. It's not the Black Panthers, it is a couple of well-spent hours with modern cinema.",1428192000,4,1264,4.855813953488372

However, this is not a movie I plan to watch again. The film shows blacks at their most culturally stereotypical.

This movie shoes how being ""pro-black"" can be viewed as over aggressive allowing for the issue at hand to yet again be over looked. At times those of us who are ""pro-black"" have difficulty explaining what it is to be pro-black without seeming short sited and ethnocentric in addition to displaying how some black people intentionally feed into a stereotype for acceptance while others try to fit the ""acceptable Negro"" role. This movie also shows how individuals who never openly participate in racial discrimination can be very accepting of microagressions such as modern day black face parties titled ""Pimp and Hoe"" parties or ""Gansta and Hoe"" parties where a white frat will dress in ""black face"" emulating their idea of how black people behave.

While the movie doesn't have a lot in common with it, I got that type of vibe from it. I would say this is worth watching. Some will get it, some won't.

6757843,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"I just finished the film and I feel the need to parry the caveats and the few low reviews on here. Dear White People is a rumination - on our true selves, past all our protestations and rhetoric; the ever-shifting alliances for the sake of pleasing other people, fitting an image, or making it; and the way that cultural insensitivity and conflicts arise.

Three colleges mentioned in the credits experienced such turmoil - one of them within 5 minutes of me (UCSD), where outrage about a Compton Cookout and noose in the library was all people could talk about for weeks. Even when tensions abate, college campuses are split into cliques, often along class or color lines. Mingling can be intimidating sometimes and people isolate to stay comfortable. Folks really do say some cringe-worthy, callous things from time to time. The issues that are joked about (often in an exaggerated manner) are undying stereotypes that are readily encounterable - that whiteness means blandness, that black people are concealing some ghetto element or are ready to excoriate you for the slightest trespass or are unaccepting of gayness, and so forth. Nourished by ignorance, misconceptions abound  about welfare, affirmative action, black-on-black violence, what people of color face daily, and (the farce of) a post-racial society. In that sense, I feel like the film was a success; it acts as a mirror for self-evaluation and brings these issues to the forefront no matter what color or background you come from.

The characters brought that to life, especially Lionel, a shy kid who fit in neither here nor there, pressed on his black credentials by the militant BSU crew, and an odd man out with the Anglo newspaper bunch. Its all infinitely relatable  who hasn't been the outsider before, or sucked into a mannerism or mold for the sake of approval?

In terms of its success as a comedy, I was snickering and had a smile on my face the whole way through. I am usually pretty hard to please, but it passed the test.

Edit: Other topics I appreciated mentioned: fetishization of ethnicity as exoticism; the natural hair debate; universities' desire to please donors at all costs and avoid controversy (often achieved by dragging their feet until action is inevitable), as well as their token feel-good campaigns and promotions... More to come at a time other than 3:00 AM.",1425686400,,2360,4.946969696969697

It isn't amazingly shot or cut, some of the characters are a bit flat and don't really evolve or develop throughout the picture. Still it was probably one of the best movies I saw in 2014. If for nothing more than the conversations that took place after the movie. It is a movie with a point and a purpose, a highlight of internal and external bias in and around young African-American's which effects all of us, educated or not. Touching on media, journalistic, and television portrayals of blacks to how even those with the best intentions still can run the gamut from culturally insensitive to malicious. It is one of those movies worth watching and worth sharing, despite its flaws.

6757867,2,B00OMCCI8Y,"I had seen this movie finally last week (I have been waiting for a couple of years since its production), I am highly disappointed!

The only character that stood out to me was Coco portrayed by actress Teyonnah Parris which had much potential for character development. And I really like the scene with character Troy and his father speaking, and the Daddy states ""they will see what they want to see so be careful"" (not exact quote); and the character Leonel should have had much character development also. The way this movie ended was an excuse to blend everything and everyone into a falsehood of things work out the way they should.

The satire in the movie is hilarious to me, my sense of humor so I enjoyed that but that is not enough for me to like this (plus I have been following Dear White People YouTube comedy skits so I know about the satire).

And the only song that stood out to me in the movie is ""Believe in God"" by Blackface, Sean Wyze, and Poetik Force, it has a really nice sound.

I do not recommend this movie because the promotion and movie trailer did awesome to get society's attention on its topic but it fell flat with its story overall. Out of ten stars, I give four. Highly disappointed.",1425168000,,1218,4.448430493273543

6757892,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"The film was like ""Higher Learning,"" but without murder (spoiler alert).  While there are the typical college occurrences (class, hooking-up, relationship struggles, family issues, etc.), much of the film focuses on racial commentary and how Black college students on a predominantly white campus try to find their way and make the school a better place for Black students.  And really, I think this is an accurate depiction-- class is such a small reality of college life at these types of schools and can easily be overshadowed by other experiences on campus, especially experiences as outrageous/offensive as the ones in this movie (and some of my college experiences).

As a Black Ivy League graduate, I thought this was an excellent movie that I could totally relate to.  I'm sure I was the target demographic, though I've been out of college for a decade.  This film captured the many emotions/identities that Black students in these types of schools/institutions go through, the struggles they have to endure, and the never ending feeling of having to represent all Black people and educate non-Blacks at the same time. While I was never one of the main characters at all times, there were definitely times when I embraced each of their characteristics as a coping/survival mechanism or, as is the case in college, I tried to find myself-- fight the power, token, sellout, and outcast from Black and white.

I also liked the subtle unification of ""diverse"" students in order to protest the inappropriate party (easy to miss if you're not paying attention).  I can totally relate to this at my school- we may separate for weekly meetings, but when $h!* hits the fan, they understand exactly what we're upset about and we're all in it together.

There was even a small glimpse into the administration of these schools-- the head of diversity has very little power, but gets blamed/has the burden for everything ""race""; the legacy/big name students who aren't that bright get a pass for everything (who somehow got in, but nobody questions that form of affirmative action); and the arguably more talented/smarter Black kids are accused, used, and disrespected yet strive to work for the dumb white classmate.  I thought the final scene was very accurate and telling-- these schools will do anything for money, even at the expense of their ""diverse"" students and/or in the name of ""free speech"" . . . which of course is only a right if somebody white is saying something.

Could the movie have handled some things better?  Sure, but you can only do so much in 1.5 hours . . . if this was turned into a ~50 season-series, I'm sure it would hit on everything.  I hope that Black people in HWCUs come away with some coping mechanisms and some ways to fight the power (personal and educational, internal and external) while white people come away with a greater understanding of our struggles at these schools and the roles we're forced to play at one time or another.  At the very least, I hope white people will understand that they should keep their hands out of my hair ;)",1424649600,45,3075,4.845419847328245

Whites who chose to watch a movie with this title are probably more open to attempting to understand the black viewpoint than the average moviegoer. Instead the characters were shallow, insipid and one dimensional.  The plot line was weak.

I have adopted siblings who are black.  I am white and middle aged and grew up in the South.  You can imagine there were issues and there were.  My siblings and I have had many, many discussions about these issues and I have witnessed discrimination against my siblings which was both overt and covert. I probably have a better window into discrimination than many whites, but not a truly clear picture as when my siblings are on their own I do not see how whites treat them.  I have experienced many issues when I have my nieces (one is black, one is biracial) visiting.  It is a complicated topic and one that deserves a better treatment than this moronic film.

This movie missed a golden opportunity to explain to white people how black students perceive the world.  I have long been interested in how a black student who is well qualified feels about racial quotas.  It must be frustrating not to know if you were admitted on your own merit, and if you were admitted solely on merit to have others feel that you were admitted due to quotas.  There are a myriad of other issues which could be addressed and were not.

A waste of an educational opportunity.  The only thing most whites will come away with is that blacks have issues about their hair.  Not exactly world changing and not even entertaining.",1424044800,12,1602,4.6512455516014235

The interesting thing about this entire film is that only once did any of these black students mention a historical black person and that was a split second reference to Harriet Tubman, more than anything else this film reflects how deeply confused todays young black people are about just who they are, I was lucky in respect to having Master Teachers such as DR. CLARKE AND DR. BEN teach me exactly who I am as a black man in America (read my reviews of the three films HIDDEN COLORS PARTS 1,2, and 3), it is somewhat sad that while many young black students in these white colleges and universities are trying to  understand who they are, many historically black colleges and universities are struggling to survive, I still enjoyed watching this film.",1423958400,,1108,4.770833333333333

I am SO HAPPY I rented this. It used satire the way satire was always intended to be used, had a balanced perspective and showed a little part of modern day race relations in the United States. This movie isn't racist, it's about the man made concept race, the way we let is separate us as a society and the real life consequences our hypocrisy has. I was surprised by how diverse the cast was..Tessa Thompson (she's 31, whaaaattt how) really shined throughout the movie and I absolutely loved her character development. Overall, I am glad movies like these are getting made and I think their entire team from casting to wardrobe did a brilliant job. Such a breath of fresh air.

6757957,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"This is my first Amazon Movie Review.

I was very excited to see this provocatively titled movie ever since I saw the trailer on YouTube. Although I will agree with other reviewers that many of the ""laugh out loud"" scenes were already featured in the promos, this film deserves 5 stars more for its socio-political commentary than for its comedic performance. As a young black male at a predominantly white/Caucasian university I can fully identify with most of the sentiments of these characters. It was a relief to finally see myself in a movie, and not as a slapstick, one-line delivering ""token black guy"", or as a hoodstar gang member turned rap mogul, or as an athlete given purpose from his non-black mentor. This movie was audacious, witty, and lingers with the viewer. It petitions you to ask questions about your individual prejudices, and it offers a different POV of the black experience not commonly portrayed on film and media. I loved it and I hope the director makes more films such as these.",1423699200,,1008,4.793103448275862

6757959,3,B00OMCCI8Y,"I must first admit that I came into this film thinking it was more satire than comedic social commentary. What I found was the exact opposite. So let me tell you that this is not a great film, its good, but not great, and it is the type of film that will make you (if you are a white person) cringe as much as you laugh.

What I really liked about the film was the wide variety of perspectives from inside the black community that were portrayed. In our current political climate it is easy to forget that there are a number of perspectives on each side of an issue and they are not binary at all. I also enjoyed the filmmakers decision to show vulnerability and flaws in the characters. It would have been easy to try and create archetypes of black culture that are above reproach, given the subject matter, but instead the film maker showed that every issue has multiple sides and the people on those sides are not perfect, and often far from it.

The major drawbacks are easy to identify; the movie is long (and full of dialogue), and it is not easy to watch (for a white audience). That being said I would think this is worth the time to see if you are interested in gaining insight into another culture or if you want to smirk at the foibles of your own.",1423699200,,1259,4.2635983263598325
6757960,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"Very intelligent, very timely.  Rather than a blamefest, anti-white rant, this film goes beyond the obvious.

This is a great conversation starter.  Don't fear what you don't understand.  This doesn't steal any of your personal power.",1423612800,3,412,5.166666666666667

6757962,4,B00OMCCI8Y,"It's true what other reviewers say- most of the funny parts were in the trailer (though Sam's first movie title killed me!), but the story was also just good in itself.

Side Preface: The movie was not, to my disappointment, all about ripping white people a new one, but there were definitely satirical moments. The humor isn't biting but if you know anything about race, you'll see more meanings/connections underneath the obvious top layer.

But the movie was really about four different types of black experience: The Malcolm X activist type, the Awkward Doesn't-Fit-Anywhere guy, the Guy Who Has it Made, the Aspirations of Fame one. By the end, you see each of the four protagonists go through changes and reflect on their supposed fixed positions (or lack thereof) at the university. And even though this movie is about black lives and black stories, it is also relatable for anybody. Believe or not, black people have problems in their lives besides their race, just like everybody else. So four college kids trying to navigate their way through the various pressures around them, on top of being a black face in a white place.

I was hoping to give this movie 5 stars for biting ""They went there!"" humor and some kind of deeply emotional climax, but I'll still give it 4 for a few good jokes, lots of good satire (including that very meta comment at the very end by the tv show producer) and lovely not-stereotypical portrayals of black people just managing their lives and good acting.",1423440000,64,1494,4.782945736434108
6757963,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"I haven't read that many reviews here on Amazon.  But it seems that most of the negative reviews are saying, in some shape or form, that the movie wasn't what they were expecting.  It also seems that they were setting those expectations a bit too strongly on the trailers.  ""It wasn't as funny as it looked!"" ""The characters weren't what I thought they'd be!"" - and similar comments.

But i think more people would give this movie the consideration it deserves if they can just get over their ideas of what they thought would happen, and pay more attention to what the movie is actually saying.  This movie makes a lot of commentary on the world today, and whether you agree with it or not, it's too important to completely dismiss the movie as not funny or predictable enough.

So the movie wasn't what you expected - So what?  That doesn't mean it's a bad movie.",1423440000,,864,4.5

6757972,3,B00OMCCI8Y,"The film is set on a fictional ivy league campus called Winchester, a predominantly white university with maybe twenty or thirty black students. From the opening credits its clear that the filmmaker views the majority of the white kids as privileged and insensitive. It is also clear from the opening credits that the filmmaker is going to take great care to show that not all of the black students are equally invested in ""blackness."" There are really two storylines. The first follows the more race-conscious black students as they try to overturn a ""randomization"" policy that places all the black students (many of whom formerly lived together in one all-black dorm) in various white dorms. (Administrators didn't like the way it looked having black kids living and socializing only with each other). The other storyline follows the all-white members of the campus comedy magazine, Pastiche, as they plan their annual Halloween party, which this year is to be a ""blackface"" party designed to mock the black radicals who they view as self-important poseurs. Its a clever two-pronged plot that could have really worked well. Unfortunately, the film is full of mostly hackneyed characters (the administrators are especially awful)  and the ultimate confrontation between the race-conscious blacks and the white-kids-acting-black is disappointing.

Fortunately, there are two characters that stand out and make the film watchable and both of these characters are ambivalent about racial identity and politics (and thus nuanced characters that we really haven't seen before). Samantha is a student activist whose views are extreme only when she is talking about race with other black student activists. When she is not with her fellow activists she is a completely different person. She is the smartest character in the film but also the most confused. Her political self tends to simplify racial matters (white people do this, black people do that) and this self provides her with temporary bouts of (illusory) clarity and power, but her private self is highly sensitive (much less extreme, much more nuanced) and thus suspicious of her own race rhetoric. Lionel is a nerdy journalism student who does not feel at home in black or white culture. The afro is less a statement about his racial identity than a symbol of his desire to have one. But other people (white people) read the afro as an invitation to exoticize him. He is a fascinating character because he is in a way a blank slate or screen onto which others read their own racial script or project their own fantasy. And knowledge of this (coupled with a growing anxiety about the ways white people view blacks revealed in the various ways they appropriate black culture) brings about a suspicion of white people that he didn't bring with him to the university. I don't think the film does everything well, but these two characters (and their struggles for identity in a ""post-racial"" society) will stay with you.",1423180800,2,2973,5.077709611451943

6757974,4,B00OMCCI8Y,"Im white.

As a white male, I know that I have privilege in this country that others dont, and I know that I don't carry over my shoulder a legacy of oppression and a stigma of stereotype, at least not an overtly harmful one.  I don't walk into a place of business and get racially profiled (at least not by the majority) and my skin color or gender will not hinder me from the things in life that I want to attain or achieve.  I also know that I am judged, due to the color of my skin, by those of a darker complexion, and I do know that, while racism still exists (I mean, you cannot deny that), prejudice also exists, and that knows no color.  I know that not all white people are evil, and I know that not all black people are part of the solution.  I know that white man does not save the black man (stop white washing history, Hollywood), and I know that not all white people are entirely ignorant.

Not everything is black and white.

So, despite the reviews and obvious critical attention, I was weary of Dear White People.  The reason for this was that I was not in the mood to sit through nearly two hours of being told that I was the problem.

Much like Gillian Robespierres smart look at another controversial subject, abortion (and yes, Im talking about Obvious Child), I thank the heavens that Justin Simiens eventual observations are intelligent and balanced.  The exploration of race relations is so clever and smart, that despite some glaring flaws, this biting satire actually says something truly profound about a subject that we see continually regurgitated on screen.

Despite developing many of the same clichs that it feels intent on dispelling (lets be honest here, some of the development of character feels a tad over saturated with subtext), Dear White People has such an honest soul, and the fact that it truly dissects the fascination with black culture and the way it can be distorted and even manipulated by both sides of the race coin is remarkably solid and poignant.  By exploring the feelings and intentions of four black students, Simiens satire develops a balance that would not have been there without the whole being represented, and so maybe it is within those overt stereotypes that we see the complete picture, the more balanced and realistic portrait.

One thing to consider here is that this is not really an exploration of race relations as a whole but more an exploration of the way in which African American youths deal with those relations.  White characters are never fully developed here, but are there to serve as plot points and narrative markers, and while I would normally balk at this as being an unfair representation of our side of the coin, I have to look at things within context, and the context of Dear White People never feels offensive in its presentation.  Yes, Kurt Fletcher and his band of miscreant frat boys are presented as the worst possible type of white privilege, but Gabe is pretty much the best possible type, and so with the two extremes represented, I feel like Simien made his point.

This story isn't about us.

No, this story is about a young man who feels as though he doesnt fit in anywhere, being too black for the white guys and too gay for the black guys.  This story is about a young woman who feels that the color of her skin is a reason to be ashamed, constantly trying to play down her roots and her attraction to men of color.  This story is about a young man so confused by his fathers ambitions and idea of black ascension that he loses his own identity within the pursuit of achievement.  This story is about a young woman so confused by her family and the tone of her skin that she pushes herself into a movement that she doesnt fully understand.

And within that mixture of faces and intentions, we see a side of race relations that isn't often explored this sharply.

The question of responsibility is brought up a lot here, and the fact that it is up to those in certain positions to be attentive, observant and assertive, and it places the spotlight on these four young people as beacons of the reason this responsibility is so important.  It also asks all of these people to be honest with themselves, which is a very important point.  All four of these students are almost afraid to be honest, afraid to look in the mirror and be themselves because they feel as though there is something expected of them because of their skin color.  The final moments, that offensive and utterly disgusting Halloween party, is a moment of deep reflection, not really on the white students involved (who were idiots to begin with), but on the black students who allowed it to go that far.

And for what?

Simiens subplot of a reality show feels a little too on the nose, and honestly wasn't necessary, but it does make a point with regards to perception and what we as a unified country have done to promote a misrepresentation of race as a whole.

And isn't that really the truth.  We help create and cement these stereotypes into our culture and our everyday life by promoting them as the only depictions of race in this country, and that is appalling and horribly misguided.

For me, despite the flaws, Dear White People is an excellent film that looks at a splintered viewpoint from daring eyes and asks questions and presents answers that maybe we never considered before, or weren't willing to admit.  In many ways, I find Simiens work here even more compelling and poignant that the racial dissections of Spike Lee, maybe because Simiens work doesnt feel so one sided and bias but actually feels like the work of a man who is actually intent on identifying and correcting a problem, but stirring the pot to see who gets angry first.",1423180800,47,5723,4.57590597453477

6757984,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"Great movie and very up-to-the-minute depiction of the continuing episodes of blatant racism in our so-called ""post racial"" culture.  It focuses specifically on racism at our colleges and universities and how is is ignored or abetted by the institutional bureaucracy.  Tyler James Williams is great as Lionel and the rest of the cast is very authentic.  This movie would be funnier if the situations and racist attitudes it depicts were not based on real incidents that occurred, and continue to occur, on supposedly ""enlightened"" campuses around the country.  It illuminates how many white people exhibit overt racism while denying they are racist.  Very provocative and a must-see.",1422835200,4,683,5.345794392523365
6757985,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"I liked the movie. It show how even in a liberal bastion of higher education that more than just implicit bias is an issue.

6757990,2,B00OMCCI8Y,"My wife and I saw the preview of this at the movies.  The preview was hilarious and this seemed like a fun little movie to watch.  Since movies of ""color"" without a big name action star rarely play our small town, I knew I had to wait for it on Amazon, Redbox or Netflix. When we saw it on Amazon, I immediately wasted my money and rented it.  I liked the preview at the movies, but this movie was disappointing. Just watch the preview (It has the best moments) and don't waste your money watching the movie. Sure there were a few comedic lines and scenes, but overall my money could have been better spent on something else.  I know what the movie was trying to say about racism, but this movie could not cut the grade.  I kept getting visions of ""Putney Swope"" meets ""Animal House.""  Now maybe if Spike Lee had teamed with Ridley Scott to make  it........",1422662400,6,857,4.31875

6757992,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"Everything about this movie was done the way it should have been done. What's the most enjoyable about this film is that there are no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys,"" though it wants you to think there is. What we have here is a look into the lives of four specific black ivy-league students who are trying to find their place as well as find themselves. The hypocrisy of all of the students (black and white) speaks a very loud message. Yes, racism still exists. It just looks different now. It is important to call attention to issues dealing with race in order to open a dialogue. Through that dialogue, we as a people, not black or white, can learn not only more about each other but about ourselves. I believe that each of the four leading black characters learned something about themselves through their experience throughout the events, and it was a pleasure watching them grow. The growth isn't dynamic or cheesy. It's realistic, and some characters grow more than others. So, whether you're the Afrocentric type of black person who protests and leads a revolution or you're the type of black person who quietly sits by enduring thinly veiled racism from white peers in order to survive or the type of black person who is somewhere in-between trying to make sense of it all, you will see yourself in these characters.",1422489600,5,1320,4.669527896995708

The only people I can imagine having a problem with this is whites who are offended by the premise of the film (""Dear WHITE people?? Why are you generalizing whites?? REVERSE RACISM!!!""). If you fall in this camp, you probably won't like the film. But guess what? Not everything is meant for YOU. You have ten billion white/""colorblind"" films to pick from. Leave this alone.

6757998,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"This movie is not perfect: at times it felt jumbled as if the filmmaker's vision was not quite fully realized. But even that feels appropriate when tackling an issue as messy and difficult to fully grasp as the concept of race in the U.S. I'm not sure that there is a clear and cohesive way to deal with this that is also thought-provoking. So however jumbled, I found this movie funny and thought-provoking, with great performances - and I feel like I can't ask for too much more from a movie. I found many of the characters genuinely nuanced and confused in a way that felt poignant and true to life. And I really enjoyed Tessa Thompson in this; I thought her character gave us several moments that felt grounded in her reality of struggling to find her identity and path as a woman who is biracial.

I am surprised at several of the reviews here. I can understand that everyone might not enjoy this movie, but I'm disappointed by the ignorance I read in many of these reviews. To me, that speaks to the need for so many more movies like this. I look forward to seeing more from this filmmaker, Justin Simien, as he continues to hone his skills and vision.",1422057600,9,1158,4.436619718309859

It had my full attention throughout. It takes a lot of courage to go against the stream, no matter what stream you happen to find yourself in. Race relations in this country still suck, but films like this reach across the divide. One of the hardest acts to pull off in our society is to be both black and white. The road in the middle is a mine-field. Anyone attempting to navigate it has my sympathy, empathy, and full encouragement. I long for the day when we see beyond color into the soul. I long for the day when anyone can be who they're most comfortable with without being judged for it. I long for the day when we get together to clear out the mines and plant trees and flowers along the way. To get there, movies like Dear White People are good sign-posts.",1422057600,7,925,4.32183908045977

6758002,5,B00OMCCI8Y,"Great movie. Another reviewer said it might make some people uncomfortable. I agree. Those are the people who need to see it.

It's a well-written, well-acted film about a blackface party at an ivy league school and the weeks prior to the event. A movie on race relations could have easily put all the characters into tired tropes or stereotypes, but instead the characters are all complex and three-dimensional.

The only criticism I would have of the movie is that there were a lot of story lines going on in the film, so sometimes it was hard to keep up. But other than that it was a great film.

I'm guilty of leaving a review here based on the title and the standard lib media ""effort"".
Not a perfect movie, but I enjoyed the characters and I am tempted to purchase it.
BAMBOOZLED is another favorite of mine which I redboxed and later purchased.
My kneejerk review from the past is below. I do NOT apologize for my honest understanding of Dems and typical racist Liberal Zombies:
Hypocrites. Too bad that Dems and Libs are playing an evil and insane game of racism.
So very evil.
It's a real thing but they have made it a joke and a tool with which to ignite the violence of ghetto welfare recipients.
Pitiful.
(I changed this from a 1 to a 3 star)
A ""need"" to antagonize and cause trouble.
Hmmm. Angst...
These are symptoms of a person with too much time on one's hands, and a tilt towards the spoilt brat.
Dems are good at causing trouble and not in a good way.
Remember OCCUPY movement?'
Watch Occupy Unmasked, 2012 from Breitbart (RIP).
Like ""Indoctrinate U"" one of the most important and valuable films every made.

6758009,3,B00OMCCI8Y,"This is a movie I thought I would love, but fell flat on comedy and purpose. The film centers on black students at a fictional Ivy League college. There is a Vlog called ""Dear White People"" which tells white people what black people think...as if they care. One of the funnier lines was that you now need two black friends to not be a racist and Tyrone who sells you weed doesn't count. Yup. That was a real knee slapper.

Sam White (Tessa Thompson) is a bi-racial student, they actually used the word ""mulatto""... horrors! She has race identity issues and must over compensate. While the college wants to integrate students, she wants to maintain a black house to maintain black culture. She hates Tyrone Perry movies that stereo-type black people. And white people who use the term African-American instead of black so they don't seem racist are racist.

The characters and plot really didn't evolve that well. The black face ""riot"" that occurred was a let down and the message was confused. Perhaps the confused message is that race relations is stalled at crossroads, pulling in a number of directions.

The best part of the film was the silent movie shown within the film. Most of the drama of the film I found artificial and boring. ""Black or White"" or even ""Supremacy"" are better and more realistic films about race relations... and less boring.
