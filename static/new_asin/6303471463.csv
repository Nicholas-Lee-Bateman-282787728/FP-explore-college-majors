654635,2,6303471463,"Bert I. Gordon made some low-budget sci-fi flicks back in the atomic age 1950s. Here we have Bert's '50s style big-bug story updated for the '70s. Again, nuclear energy (i.e., waste) creates monsters. Live ants, photographically enhanced to giant proportions, look clumsy rather than menacing. For close-ups, there are ant-shaped mechanical heads. The color photography is a plus, but it also draws attention to the limitations of the special effects. As usual, hapless victims perish brutally. As usual, these expendable characters are present only to meet their fate. These ants have the power of reason. Their sinister plan to subjugate humans and found an ant-empire is an offbeat slant to the familiar monster-on-the-loose formula. To be fair, there is some suspense in this little flick. There is also silly dialogue and bad acting. Weighed in the balance, it is found wanting. Die-hard fans of low-budget sci-fi/horror flicks may take interest in this flick.

654830,5,6303471463,"During the 1970s, when ""Earth Day"" and recycling really began to come to the public mindset, there were some directors that took advantage of it and sent a message through the movie industry. What they came up with was perhaps one of the most ""mad themed"" movies to ever be produced.  EMPIRE OF THE ANTS was another Bert Gordon production who also gave us FOOD OF THE GODS,
It all starts when some illegal toxic waste barrels were dumped into the waters off ""Dreamland Shores"", a future ""sporting club"" of sorts. Heading the ""pleasure cruise"" of the doomed is Joan Collins (Tales From the Crypt), a shrewd businesswoman that takes orders from no one. Once on the property, things start to go wrong after a couple goes missing snooping around looking for ""faults"".
The ""tour"" finds one of the people alongside the road, dead, and the panic begins. They head back for the boat only to find the boat being overrun by Giant Ants.
Robert Lansing, the Captain of the Boat, sees it from shore and heads out swimming to it only to find that it's probably a lost cause to get them off. His partner is killed by one of the Ants and he decides to blow the boat up by dumping gasoline and lighting it, narrowly escaping.
Once on shore, they realize it's going to be difficult to get back to civilization. The weather moves in and makes it even more difficult for the survivors of ""Dreamland Shores"" to get out alive....

This is one of those campy, 1970s movies you either hate or love. There was no CGI at hand. They had to use their imagination and prop effects available to them at the time. It worked, but you can't expect ""Interstellar"" effects back then in a movie like this. Just enjoy it for what it is, a campy sci-fi thriller of the times with a simple message to humankind. Don't mess up the environment with your illegal dumping of toxic waste and poisons!

654836,2,6303471463,"Empire of the Ants (Bert I. Gordon, 1977)

In the late seventies, I was at a friend's house and I caught a few sequences of It Happened at Lakewood Manor on television. I had no idea what it was, and I spent years, decades actually, tracking that movie down. This, of course, brought me into contact with pretty much every ant-related movie that was made in the seventies. Once I found out Empire of the Ants dealt with monster-sized ants, I knew it wasn't the movie I was looking for, but when I found a listing for it in the mid-eighties and saw Joan Collins' name attached, I had to wonder what sorts of shenanigans this movie held in store. Now I have seen it, and I know the answer, and I wish it was 1985 again and I was just stumbling upon this movie and still wondering how ridiculous it could be.

You know that old saw about having prime real estate in Okefenokee Swamp to sell? Well, this is where it came from. Collins (Dynasty) plays Marilyn, a shady real estate agent who's trying to pass off a little island in the middle of a swamp as paradise that's just begging for a resort to be developed on it. She takes down a passel of prospective buyers, and they discover the area infested with ants. Now, that's not usually enough to get people to not buy land, but you see, these ants are about twenty feet long, as tall as elephants, and need a few tourists to help out with their plan for intergalactic domination. Or something.

While you're watching this, if you're an aspiring filmmaker, just keep saying to yourself someone greenlit this. Of course, in the direct-to-video age, if you end up making Empire of the Cockroaches, it's probably not going to open on a thousand screens...but you never know. Put together a bunch of non-actors, head them up with some fading TV character types, add the cheapest script and special effects money can buy, and, well, you've just created an American International Picture, really. My guess is that if you caught this back in the day, and were very young at the time, it may hold a good deal of nostalgia value, the same way It Happened at Lakewood Manor does with me these days. But for everyone else it can safely be avoided. * ",1397606400,,2186,4.4575

654945,4,6303471463,"Yes, this movie is a ""B"" or less. The problem comes in taste or preference. There is some social redeeming value.

Dumped drums of toxins leek on ants. Mean while real-estate agents try to sell beautiful coastline locations unaware that they may become ant-chow.

The Photography is poor. This is a candidate for MST3000. I can not quite say that it is Joan Collins ""Biography - Joan Collins"" ASIN: B000006QJR at her best. And you know how some movies are so bad that it is good? Well this is not one of those movies.

On the other hand there is a lot of stay in the car scenes and action in running away from ants. You can guess who the bad Guy(s) are. But then you have to figure out why and what their angle is. It leaves you with the feeling that all ants eat sugar and slow people. But only the queen ant eats beans and doesn't use gas-x.

Watch at your own risk.

No plot spoilers from me; the story centers around a shady real estate developer Marilyn Fryser (Collins) that is trying to unload worthless plots on a group of would be investors. Unfortunately the land is already claimed by ants, giant ants, and they have a plan! The acting is typical '70s, the plot is actually fairly good (based on an H.G. Wells story), but the special effects are really just as bad as they come (seriously I have seen 1940's movies with better effects).

This is actually watchable but not really enjoyable.

655088,2,6303471463,"The only reason I watched, or tried to watch, ""Empire of the Ants"" is because I adore and love Joan Collins. I always knew it was a terrible film because I had seen it on various stations late at night during the early nineties. Also, after reading Joan's two autobiographies and reading her pages on the filming of this movie a few years back I simply had to rewatch the film. In both her books Joan makes it known that ""Empire of the Ants"" was the hardest and most grueling picture she had ever made.

 She writes how the film was shot in the Florida swamps in November and December, 1976, with the acors being exposed to insects and reptiles. The scene where the actors are tipped over while in a canoe was hellish as the water hadn't moved in a dozen years and Joan prayed she wouldn't be eaten alive by some strange underwater creature. According to Joan, who never does her own stunts, the stunt doubles hadn't arrive from L.A. probably because the producer was too cheap to hire them.

 While doing this piece of crap Joan suffered bruises, cuts, and on one stormy morning nearly became blind in one eye when a door to a car slammed against her face because of the fierce winds.

 Collins did the movie like any desperate actor: because she was broke and needed the money. Her salary was a paltry $15,0000, an amount extremely low even for someone starring in a low-budget horror film from the mid seventies.

 As a lover of the horror genre ""Empire of the Ants"" wouldn't even be classified as a horror movie. I rate it as simply a terrible film. I have to wonder why it was ever made as the script was rediculous, the acting dreadful, and the scenery dreary.

 Joan Collins was the only bright spot in an otherwise hideous film, but Robert Pine, who would go on to success on TV's ""CHIPS"", plays a sexy woman-hungry guy.",1291593600,2,1828,4.446107784431137
655089,3,6303471463,"""Empire of the Ants"" is one of the most laughable monster spectacles of the 1970s, even by Bert I. Gordon's standards. Gordon, whose trademark was giant or tiny things brought to life in ""horrifying"" adventures, was the patriarch of such films as ""Village of the Giants"", ""Attack of the Puppet People"", ""The Amazing Colossal Man"", and most notably ""The Food of the Gods"". Of course Gordon did some more conventional pictures as well, but he will always be known for bad rear projections and puppets of animals of intensely incorrect size. By the time this film was done in 1977, his effects techniques were extremely dated, and the ants actually look much less realistic than many creatures from his earlier films. The rear projection method is especially bad, and the sense of scale of the ants changes throughout the film. Watch for the scene at the sugar refinery when the ants climb the sky next to the building. On the other hand, the projections are ultra-realistic compared to the ant puppets used for the close-up ant attack shots, scenes which are so funny they actually account for the relatively generous three star rating I gave the film.

The film opens with a narrator somberly intoning ""This is the ant. Treat it with respect..."" over closeups of an anthill. The narrator goes on to explain that ants are incredibly smart and that ""some herd aphids, just as man herds cattle"". The film then shifts to the credits and radioactive waste drums being dumped into the ocean in a scene extremely reminiscent of ""The Horror of Party Beach"". Of course a drum of waste immediately washes ashore and springs a leak, which ants flock to. By a stroke of luck, Joan Collins is an uppity real estate agent trying to sell lots of radioactive swampland in a development called ""Dreamland Shores"". If ever there was a role Joan was born to play, it was this one. Joan has chartered a boat skippered by Dan Stokely (Robert Lansing) who turns in by far the most competent performance in the movie. There is a cast straight out of any mid 70's disaster movie, and upon alighting at the island unfettered lust and emotion immediately breaks out in multiple unsavory subplots.

With the menacing theme music (which sounds very similar to a John Williams score that you may be quite familiar with) swelling portentously, the ants start to divide and conquer, ruining several ridiculous romances and making this into more of a soap opera starring Joan Collins and giant ants than an actual horror movie. The Lawsons (Jack Kosslyn and Ilse Earl), an unlikable couple, are the first to depart this mortal realm when they venture into the woods to inspect the fire hydrants on their own (honest). The rest of the tour group continues on their inspection of the property without even noticing they are gone. When their absence is noticed two other passengers go looking for them, finding something they really didn't want to in the process, and making everyone wonder if you are venturing into a swamp for commercial purposes, wouldn't you at least take the precaution of packing a radio? There's an advanced tram system after all, but no communication facilities of any sort.

After the insect mayhem commences in earnest, they have to decide whether to go on foot, stand their ground, or hike two miles to a boat and freedom (I should point out that the ants attacked the boat they arrived on; it burned and sank). The dialogue in the film is unbelievably inane, but my favorite line comes when the group is deciding what to do at this juncture and one woman shrieks ""We're all too scared to vote!"" Really? That's a new one. They decide to make a run for the boat, and despite lots of ludicrous excitement-inducing plot devices (Collin's sweater is snagged on a small twig. How will she ever get free?!) the majority of the group gets into a rowboat, and after the patently absurd and entirely predictable death scene of the old freeloading couple, Harry and Velma Thompson (Harry Holcombe and Irene Tedrow), they start to paddle down the stream. It doesn't take long to pick out the next to die, as the histrionics that emerge from Larry Graham (Robert Pine) are so over-the-top (""It's unfair this should happen to me!"") It turns out the ants actually are smarter than the cast members, because they capsize the boat and start chasing the five remaining survivors in a single direction (""They're herding us like cattle!"") Just in the nick of time, they encounter a homestead owned by a crazy old couple who solemnly intone ""Whatever you do, don't let them take you to the sugar refinery"", implying they know about the giant ant menace.

Suddenly in a jarring bit of direction, the survivors are in a police car, being taken to the station, lodging, and the sugar refinery (of course). After a subplot about the difficulties of renting a car, the survivors steal a car, and are quickly intercepted by police officers who take them to the refinery. This is no ordinary refinery. When a whistle blows giant ants swarm to get sugar, and the entire place is operated by zombies. Well, they aren't actually undead type zombies, but they are incapable of independent thought, and the sheriff and mayor are in on the ghastly mind-control plot in which the queen ant controls all the people to do her will by releasing pheromones in a big spray of stink at them in a phone booth. This is called indoctrination, and everyone needs a booster once a week. Naturally our survivors head straight for the front of the line. Joan Collins gets sprayed, and becomes an instant convert to the wisdom of the great ant. Next up is Captain Lansing, who lights the queen on fire with a road flare, while fellow hero-in-waiting Joe Morrison (John David Carson) escapes, steals a gasoline tanker truck and lights the whole place ablaze resulting in fiery chaos and a ludicrous burning ant puppet. In the end the sheriff joins the anti-ant forces and the four principals escape in another stolen boat, while the music swells.

""Empire of the Ants"" is definitely one of Bert I. Gordon's most ridiculous projects, but it does have quirky moments of pure campy entertainment that make it worthwhile for any aficionado of cinematic cheese. The script is terrible, even for a movie of this sort, the acting is atrocious, the special effects look positively ludicrous, and Joan Collins playing it deadly seriously sends it over the top. If you want a scary horror film, do not even think about it; if you want to laugh at a spectacular Hollywood embarrassment, this is the film for you.",1278028800,,6544,4.767195767195767

A bunch of cheapskates go with Joan Collins on a real estate, timeshare sort of all-expense-paid cruise to a remote island.  Of course, no one on the trip actually intends to buy the real estate. They just want free booze and to sneak a peak at Joan Collins' caboose!

They go to the island and, little do they know that toxic waste recently fell of a government barge into the water coming ashore.  This toxic waste mutates some ants.  Do ants usually travel so far into the sand toward the coming tide of water? Anyway....they get mutated, turn into monster ants, and kill of the cheapskates one by one.

Before reading on, you must ask yourself some questions...

Do you enjoy watching elderly people get devoured by ants?

Do you like watching a has-been British snob of an actress boss people around?

Do you like watching Jacqueline Scott, a really corney actress, hit on Robert Lansing, who doesn't have the slightest interest in her, understandably!?

Do you mind seeing Pamela Shoop? Of course not, that's a stupid question. What a 70's hottie!

Do you think you can stand watching enormous, fake-looking props made of cardboard and painted plastic that are supposed to be ant mandables and arms?

How about an entire town that has been brainwashed by the ants into becoming their slaves through pheremone chemical suggestion?

If the answer is ""yes,"" you're good to go! Of course, there's a dude named Larry who is a real WEASLE throughout the movie.  Robert Pine plays Larry. Robert Pine was the chief on ""Chips,"" the tv cop show in the 70's. Well, Larry is such a chicken to help his wife that he lets the ants eat her rather than try and save her life.  Great guy! Jeez.

Check out this movie; it's fun....",1180224000,3,1769,4.658064516129032
655094,2,6303471463,"This is terrible. Thank goodness the Midnight Movies DVD release had the sense to dress up the cover with shlocky artwork that encourages you to enjoy the cheesier aspects of the film rather than the drama, because as a serious monster movie, it fails pretty solidly. Joan Collins leads the not-so-star cast in a tale of rampaging giant ants, grown huge on eating radioactive waste and overrunning a remote swampland location where Joan is leading a guided tour of prospective real-estate purchasers. The ants have grown to the size of horses and they aren't shy about attacking, so it's a fight for survival as the terrified humans try and escape the ant-filled swamp.

The cast are all pretty forgettable, and even Joan Collins does little with her (admittedly 2-dimensional) part. Playing the part of a haughty, manipulative schemer is one of her proven abilities, and she performs adequately and it is always nice to see her strutting and sniping while she's onscreen. Unfortunately her acting skills fail her when she is called upon to cower in terror in the face of giant ants, but then, none of the cast manage to pull this off realistically with the very poor special effects that have to contend with. And of course its giant ants we have paid to see, so after half an hour of very obvious character setting dialogue and strolling about, we are ready to cheer as we finally see the first giant ants attack....oh dear.

Well, it's not good. The ants are presented on screen in two ways, either in magnified footage of real ants performing on tiny sets, or giant fake prop ants bumping into the live actors for the attack close ups. The shots with real ants are sometimes blended together with shots of the actors which looks really bad on-screen, and you can see the dividing lines between the composite images almost every time. If this had been done flawlessly, the film would have looked great during these sequences because the close up ant footage is quite good, and on certain occasions the joins are not all visible (the old couple who find themselves surrounded when emerging from a small hut is quite a good example), but these good scenes are nearly always spoiled by the actors being required to stand rooted to the spot in case they unwittingly step outside of the patch of screen they are contained in, while the ants similarly rattle around in their portion of the screen, and the two sides never touch each other.

The giant fake ants are another matter entirely. Big cumbersome props of giant ant heads and a couple of the front legs are pushed and poked at the screaming actors who seem to fall to the ground and become magically covered in blood without making even the slightest effort to get out of the way. This is most glaringly apparent in the very first ant-attack, when a man urges his wife to run away, only to remain standing completely still himself, waiting to be eaten. Whats worse is that every  (and I mean EVERY) scene involving the fake giant ants attacking people is filmed with a wildy flailing camera that is constantly swinging in all direction, obviously done to avoid showing the dummy giant ants too clearly and for too long. It's intensely irritating, but you can easily see why the director did it, as the model ants are pretty bad. They don't resemble the live ants very well, especially as they have big tufts of ginger hair all over them! Oh yes and they also make loud, electronic-sounding noises all the time...of course, because real ants are noted for the very loud chirruping, whirring noises they make, aren't they? And later on in the film, they also scream, which I thought had to be one of the female cast members when i first heard it, but no, it's the ants, yelling out and generally overacting more than the human cast.

There's plenty more lame plot, effects and twists to come before the end of the film, and all of it done with a really rotten script and some very daft plot devices. Right at the start of the attack, the captain of the small boat that brought the tourists decides to BLOW-UP the vessel - just because a couple of ants have jumped aboard! Surely any rightminded captain would think of a way to get them off and use the boat to escape rather than scupper it immediately...it's not even out at sea, just tethered to a small jetty. As soon as I saw this scene, my little remaining respect for the script went right down the pan, and I realised I might as well steel myself for plenty more lapses in logic to start cropping up - and they did, countless times.

This film is a dud of magnificent proportions, and to think I actually went to the theatre to watch it when it was released in the late 1970's. As a kid, I thought the giant ants were cool, but I must have missed all the awful script inconsistencies and poor acting. Some of the film is bad enough to be genuinely funny, so if you are thinking of watching it, get ready to laugh, because there's nothing remotely scary or dramatic going on here.",1152057600,,4988,4.586322869955157

655096,3,6303471463,"Review by the students enrolled in ENT 201, Insects on Film, Clemson University, Spring 2005.

Empire of the Ants, is not your typical, scary horror film.  I understand that this film was made in 1977, but even Godzilla was scarier than this movie.  This movie is a balance between sci-fi and comedy.  It stars Joan Collins as a self-centered real estate agent in the process of selling swampland, in the form of a soon-to-be resort, to potential buyers.  Only towards the end of the movie does the director throw in a little suspicion to try and keep the viewers interested.  On the other hand, I did find a little humor in the film and if compared to movies similar to, Beginning of the End, it was not that bad.

The movie begins with Marilyn, the owner of Dreamland Shores, taking a boat load of potential buyers to see her ""overpriced swampland"".  On the island she tries to wheel and deal her customers into buying land by giving them free liquor and food.  Little do these people know, Dreamland Shores is infested with gigantic, people eating ants that have been eating toxic waste that washed ashore.  One by one the ants pick off some of the buyers leaving only six of them to escape the ants and reach safety in a near by town.  Once they arrive in the town they begin to notice little things that seem very strange.  Only about one-third of the group makes it to the town, where none of the locals seem concerned about the ants.  As they try to escape they are captured again and this time they are taken to the sugar refinery only to find out that the inhabitants of the town are being hypnotized by the queen ant.  Now, their only chance at surviving is by crossing a river and going to a local town.  The fear that they might become slaves to a queen ant provokes Don, the boat captain, to shoot a flare at the queen allowing him and the rest of his crew to escape, except for Marilyn who was hypnotized before she could escape.  Upon escaping, John, who is only along for the free food and drinks, drives a gas truck around the sugar refinery and sets fire to it which kills the ants.

The downsides to this film were that some of the scenes were used over and over again, and there was a good bit of foreshadowing in the film.  Although the scenery was cheesy, the entomology facts were correct in some parts of the movie.  The queen ant in the movie uses pheromones to gain power over the town's people, which is similar to how queen ants in real life gain power over other ants; I guess that the same scenes were used over and over in order to save money or to save time.  This might help out while shooting the film but in the end it makes for a poorly produced movie.  The foreshadowing in the film makes it hard to get interested at first.  Once the six characters make it safely to the town, the foreshadowing stops and a bit of suspicion are thrown in and this is where the film gets a little interesting.

Looking at the scientific side of the film also helps to redeem this film's rating.  The ants in the movie portrayed correctly. There are around 20,000 species of ants; 570 species exist just in the U.S.  In each species, there are three types of ants:  the queen, the sterile females, and the males.  Ants have inhabited Planet Earth for 100 million years.  They were shown as being everywhere, in every direction that you turn, and when shown up close you could tell that they have hair.  In the movie, the queen ant controls the town and all the people in the town.  On the scientific side of ants there are three types of ants: the queen, males, and workers.  Of these three types of ants the queen controls the males and the workers.

Aside from labeling this film a horror and by not overlooking the downsides makes it easier to say that this movie is not a great film. .  The actors/actresses did a good job of playing the roles of the scared visitors and the ant controlled town's people.  The music selection was great for portraying the mood, feelings, and emotions throughout the movie.  By looking at the end of the movie and the scientific side of the film you can see that there was not much time or energy put into making this movie.  This movie was all together informative and somewhat entertaining for a 1977 flick!",1109721600,3,4264,4.407928388746803
655097,5,6303471463,"Hold onto your wits and hold on for a wild ride as Joan Collins leads the way on this South Florida adventure. Joan is in the real-estate business, actually she's a con artist trying to sell worthless swampland to anyone that will listen. The would-be customers gather on the boat for a free ride and refreshments. Once at the location, the high pressure sales pitch begins. Little do they know that some ants have been swimming in radioactive waste and are now the size of Cadillacs.

Joan looks lovely running through the woods and going down the river in a rowboat. She's very sexy when she sweats profusely. Not everyone in her party is as fortunate as her though. An elderly couple who can't keep up bite the dust. Also a husband who decides it's cheaper to sacrifice a wife than pay for a divorce watches his wife get devoured. No real loss for him, he already had his eyes on another chick in the little band.

Well the ending is pretty weird. Seems the whole town is under the control of the ants thanks to some kind of Brain washing gas that the people get a whiff of when placed in a glass box with the Queen Ant. Alas poor Joan doesn't make it out of the box. The ant decides she'd rather make a good meal.

I love Joan Collins and got this movie only because of her. She once said this was the most grueling part she ever played. If you like Joan too, I highly suggest this little gem of a film.",1097280000,7,1407,4.2819548872180455
655186,3,6303471463,"Run for the hills (or the Raid)!  Bert I. Gordon, aka Mr. Big (due to his penchant for making films involving giant creatures, and also, it's his initials), brings on some serious cinematic pain with his rendition of author H.G. Wells story Empire of the Ants (1977).  Other cinematic examples of Gordon's super-sizing include Beginning of the End (1957), The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), Earth vs the Spider (1958), Attack of the Puppet People (1958), and The Food of the Gods (1976).  Gordon, certainly a man of many hats, not only wrote (adapted from an H.G. Wells story), directed and produced the film, but he also was in charge of the special effects.  The film stars Joan Collins of TV's Dynasty, Robert Lansing, whose television credits are too numerous to mention but is most familiar to me from the 1959 film 4D Man, and perennial 70's television stars John David Carlson and Jacqueline Scott.

In the beginning we get some painfully obvious foreshadowing involving stock footage, along with voice over, showing ants busy at work.  We then cut to workers in HAZMAT suits on a boat, dumping clearly marked barrels of radioactive waste in the water.  We see one of the barrels wash up on shore, as the ominous music plays on...Cut to preparations being made for an excursion by yacht to view swampy properties for sale, sponsored by some realty company called Dreamland Properties, or some such thing.  It's here we meet Marilyn Fryer (Collins), the woman in charge.  How do we know this?  Because she's being a real pain in the rear, basically telling everyone she's the boss, especially Dan Stokely (Lansing), the captain of the boat, who, by the way, wears a lovely earring (yargh, I'm a pirate!) throughout the film (man, the 70's were weird).  Soon the prospective suckers...er, I mean buyers show up, and what a charming lot they seem to be...adulterers, freeloaders, and just general sleezy characters all around, and they're off, leisure suits and all.  They arrive at a pier, disembark from the yacht, and proceed to a tent to get liquored up (ply the rubes with free booze, and the property sells itself, I guess).  Everyone then gets on a two-car tram, and tool around, while Marilyn, sitting in the front of the tram, all of about 3 or 4 feet from the clients, starts yelling into a megaphone in case anyone is hard of hearing (if they weren't, they are now).  Earlier we saw the drum of radioactive waste wash up on the beach, and we also saw it beginning to leak silver paint, er...I mean radioactive waste, and we also saw ants wallowing around in the oozing material.  That can't be good...I mean, if 1950's sci-fi (and Bert I. Gordon) taught us anything, it's that radioactive materials generally have the effect of `embiggening' things.  Well, sure enough, the ants exposed to the stuff become humongoid, and start picking off hapless members of this little outing.  All I could think was this wasn't going to be good for the realty business, what with the radioactive waste and giants ants.  Well, the remaining members of the party discover, to their horror, what ate up their former companions, and rush back to the yacht, only to find it overrun with giant ants.  After awhile, they decide to make their way to a nearby river, and we lose a few more members.  I have to say, there was something completely satisfying about seeing Joan Collins wallow around in swampy river water.  Anyway, they finally make it back to civilization of sorts, try to relate their harrowing tale of escape, but find the town to be oddly apathetic to the news that giant ants are headed their way.  Why?  Well, this is where picking up on the foreshadowing at the beginning of the film pays off...

In terms of the special effects, the whole rear-projection enlargement technique was fairly well dated by the late 70's, but still managed to work well here at some points, but the noticeable difference in that technique and the use of prop ants certainly delineated the differences in the sizes of the ants.  One method use would make them appear as big as a bus, while another would make them seem a large as a man.  The actors all seem pretty bored and given they spent a fair amount of time futzing around in a swamp, I am sure they probably figured at some point they weren't getting paid nearly enough.  The script, well, is pretty hideous.  Inane remarks, pointless declarations, and lame characterizations only serve to make so very obvious who was going to be ant fodder.  And not a likeable character in the bunch ensured the audience rooted for the ants, as this particular society really didn't seem worth saving.  I did enjoy the sort of twist element near the end, even though it was telegraphed so obviously at the beginning of the film, giving this schlockery a bit of originality and a nice little spin within the genre.  I have to say, I did get annoyed early on with some of the sound effects.  The ants had two basic effects working, one being a persistent chirping which would indicate their presence nearby, and a screaming sound when they were attacking or being attacked.  This second one was definitely the more annoying of the two, as it was akin to having a woman scream in your ear every ten seconds.  A nice throwback to the 50's, but if you're into giant ants, go watch Them! (1954).

MGM provides a nice look wide screen anamorphic print here, and special features include an original theatrical trailer for the film.  I guess if I learned anything from Empire of the Ants, it's that if you are ever running through the swamp with Joan Collins, fleeing giant ants, and she gets her sweater caught, don't stop to help her, as she won't return the favor.

655188,4,6303471463,"This film is based on a true happening. Believe it or not.  A fabulous Joan Collins epic. She is glamourous and fabulous as usual as is most of the other cast, Pamela Susan Shoop(Halloween 2), Jacqueline Scott(a Twilight Zone episode, etc.). I personally love the characters in this B-film and how they introduce them to the audience. I happen to also enjoy some of the dialogue. Although this film depicts a group of people traveling to an island to view some 'shoddy' land for sale, the real occurrence was actually a bit different. How do I know this information? None of your business.  Many decades ago a certain entrepreneur was looking for an island to build a grand resort. This certain someone came upon this land which happened to be owned and operated by a government organization(not U.S.). From the information I was privy to, the story goes like this: The person and their associates came upon the land unannounced, the owners were none too pleased. As this certain organization was conducting genetic experimentation on certain organisms. Apparently, they had mutated a strain of Carpenter Ants, and grown about the size of a Volkswagen Bug (no pun!). They were having to restrain the ants just at the time the unwelcomed visitors arrived. The ants were attached to ropes, like cattle. Just as it always happens in 'the movies', the experiment was a huge disaster.  According to my source, the group of ants attacked and killed several of the scientists, the remaining scientists,authorities and land surveyors escaped unharmed in their helicopter and boats. No one ever returned to this island and of course, no one ever informed or spoke about it publicly.  I have pressed my source for the whereabouts of this island but up until the time of their death, they would would never disclose the exact location. Although I have my suspicions, due to some other personal information I have about this individual.
  So, as you can tell, the movie version is quite different and never makes any mention of it being based on a true account.
The only reason it was made into a movie is because one of the land surveyors took up screenwriting after it happened.",1076889600,3,2168,4.845945945945946

655192,3,6303471463,"""Empire of the Ants"" is yet another unintentionally funny film courtesy of director Bert I. Gordon (""Food of the Gods,"" ""The Amazing Colossal Men,"" et al). The inspiration is the H.G. Wells futuristic morality tale, but in the end the novel is more of an excuse for the film than anything else. Now our story is set in Florida where Marilyn Fryer (Joan Collins, pre-""Dynasty"") is running a real estate scam. The land in question is next to a dumping site for radioactive waste which is mutating the local ant population into giant 1950s horror movie type ants in the style of ""Them"" (literally; they are still puppets). Once the feeding frenzy begins, Captain Dan Stokely (Robert Lansing) loses his boat and drags Marilyn and some other walking entrees into the swamp and eventually a town where things get somewhat interesting.
The title does make some sense when we learn that the queen ant has actually taken over the town and its (yummy) sugar refinery. Just do not ask me to explain how the ants figure out that it is a factory and not simply a giant sugar stockpile, let alone that they need the humans to work the machines. Okay, I know that the answer is the radioactivity, but the idea it increases both the size of the ants along with their intelligence is just a bit much for me to swallow. Besides, nothing in this film makes me disposed to think kindly on these happenings, even though I remember Lansing fondly from ""Twelve O'clock High"" and interpret his constant teeth gritting having to do with his situation as an actor and not just as a character. ""Empire of the Ants"" matches the lame story with equally lame special effects; I reject the idea that relying on bad matte shots of real ants, giant fake puppet ants, and point of view shots representing the multi-faceted eyes of insects are cinematic homages on Gordon's part to the ""Beginning of the End,"" ""Them!"", and ""The Fly,"" the 1950s Science Fiction films that are most identified with such ""special effects."" After all, we are talking about as director whose is known as ""BIG"" for reasons that are ironic rather than affectionate.
In the end, ""Empire of the Ants"" is a film where you might as well root on the mutant monsters because none of the humans are really worth saving. The better parts of the film (""better"" being a relative term) are those where the ants are not around (i.e., the part where our plucky group of short-term survivors are fleeing through the swamp). But as soon as the ants pop up the question quickly becomes how much cheese do you want with your popcorn?

If only them barrels of radioactive waste that've been dumped off the coast off the FLoridian island hadn't ended up on the beach, spilling out their poison. But, probably, even that wouldn't have swayed Marilyn Fryser (a pre-Dynasty Joan Collins). She's focused on selling a lemon, on cashing in on the undeveloped island property that makes up Dreamland Shores.

It's swampland that Fryser has gussied up to look inviting. She's put up signs indicating where the golf course would go, the tennis and beach clubs, the pool area... Today, she's pitching a group of potential buyers, taking them on a fun-filled jaunt and tour of Dreamland Shores. In on the scam with her are the boat helmsman, Joe (John David Carson), and her assistant, Larry Graham (Robert Pine), who is apparently good in the sack. The makeup of their guests runs the gamut of old retirees and freeloaders and skeptics and a married Lothario who doesn't take no for an answer. ""Most people are dishonest,"" grumbles one old man, and see him validated when he espies the unconnected water pipes, them pipes there just for show.

He also finds giant mutated ants. Or is that vice versa?

Empire of the Ants is based on a story by H.G. Wells, so, for sci-fi old-heads, this is already a curio piece. It's also got, the queen of mean, Joan Collins, in a significant role. She's the reason I tuned in to TCM when it broadast this 1977 schlocker not too long ago. And, yeah, Joan lives up to her rep as an onscreen bitch. I'm not one to normally side with man-eating ants, but maybe I gave a little fist pump when, at one point, a shocked Joan Collins blurts out: ""Oh, my God! They're herding us like cattle!""

The opening of the movie feels like a documentary on National Geographics as there's grave voiceover narration that informs us of how sophisticated ants really are. Ants are broken up into various categories: the herders, the warriors, the queen ant. They have a sophisticated communication system. They secrete pheromones that can lull you into compliance. Tiny creatures that, were they given the advantage of equal size and dimension to humans, have the capability to eradicate us. As this movie demonstrates.

I don't know how well this movie was received when it was first released. Today, it's not as good. The acting is okay; some of the actors make themselves appealing enough that you root for them (not Joan Collins, though). But much of the movie is a slog, even the chase scenes. It's horribly dated. The f/x is super-cheesy, with superimposed work that was never more obvious than the scene in which behemoth ants skitter on the pier and clamber on the tour boat. The ""ant-cam"" is the one f/x element that I found mildly interesting.

The plot isn't confined to Dreamland Shores, thankfully. The panicked survivors do find themselves off that undeveloped property - no takers, sorry, Joan Collins - and end up in a weird tiny town inhabited by citizens who seem quite blas about the extinction-lvel menace looming just a few miles yonder. And I had to smile because, yeah, it's only proper that the third act takes place in a sugar refinery. Pluses: it's got Joan Collins at her bitchy best and the ""it's so bad it's good"" factor. It's perfect fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000.
