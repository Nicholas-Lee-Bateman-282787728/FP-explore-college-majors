4892269,5,B005TQAKMS,"As an instructor of Intercultural Communication at a major university in the Southwest, I am always on the lookout for films my students can enjoy and, more importantly, learn from.  To date, one of the best films is Crossing Borders, directed by Arnd Wachter.  [...] will not be disappointed!

I had the wonderful opportunity to visit with the director, Arnd Wachter.  He is a sensational man, and an inspiring teacher.  After visiting with him, exchanging ideas, I desperately want to attend the Morocco Exchange.  This is a film you do not want to miss.",1379462400,,556,4.861702127659575
4892270,5,B005TQAKMS,This film turned out to be far better than my expectations.  It provided great insight into human relationships and how such relationships create our worldview.  This is one of my new favorite documentaries.,1372118400,,207,5.242424242424242
4892271,5,B005TQAKMS,We loved this movie. It challenges Western views of countries where Islam is the predominant religion. We enjoyed watching young people learning more about each other and forming relationships.,1356048000,,193,5.689655172413793
4892272,5,B005TQAKMS,"This film is about 8 students from different backgrounds discovering what ills lie in stereotypes and how cultures are viewed from a far. This was shown in one of my classes at university. I recommend it to anyone, it must be seen to be understood fully.",1339632000,,254,4.543478260869565
8486489,5,B005TQAKMS,Authentic and real. Would like to see it with more focus on the women and their views. Well worth watching especially in the age of Trump.,1502409600,,138,4.346153846153846
8486490,2,B005TQAKMS,They don't travel together.  That's a false documentary in this case.  They sit and discuss together.,1493078400,,101,5.25
8486491,5,B005TQAKMS,"Very inspiring simple but beutifull documentary about, normal youths and the reality of our world",1486080000,,97,5.533333333333333
8486492,5,B005TQAKMS,Great cultural documentary on Morocco,1468800000,,37,6.6
8486493,5,B005TQAKMS,Very informative.,1463961600,,17,8.0
8486494,4,B005TQAKMS,"If you're a traveler or a student of humanity you will probably enjoy this movie. It was excellent to see young people meet, make friends, air their grievances, and ultimately end up seeing the commonalities of humanity rather than the differences.",1459209600,,248,5.073170731707317
8486495,5,B005TQAKMS,"That was a very good documentary that discussed ways humans can humanize one another. They touch some very big and deep philosophical points and are able to because of the college students who are the representatives for each nation. They showed the challenges and difficulties of blending people from different cultures but gave good perspective on the ways we can stop creating borders. When the Moroccans are stopped at the wall and are not allowed into Spain, I really felt like I felt their pain and lack of understanding. Why could they not go as well? Why must they have a piece of paper saying they are qualified as a human being to enter a different space?

Wow. Wonderful. Will be showing this film to students in the future. No doubt.",1455235200,,745,4.687022900763359
8486496,5,B005TQAKMS,"Better than I expected, you think it's going one way, but it is not as forumlaic as it might seem.  Well worth the time and very touching in parts.  Very surprised to see Cueta, Spain aspect at the farewell.",1412985600,,207,4.282051282051282
8486497,3,B005TQAKMS,"Not bad. Watching it as an American it has a few eye opening moments into how Americans are viewed abroad from a very frank perspective. Those few insights are worthwhile but those aside, it is more about how college aged people who are strangers get to know each other than about cultural differences and similarities. This documentary mirrors the format of a reality TV show complete with after-the-fact side interviews about how people felt in different social situations and skips a deeper exploration of culture. Almost the entire documentary shows some interesting young folk just hanging out and while they do learn a little about each other's culture in the process it is fairly slow moving.  I wished it would have showed a little more of Morocco and had some interviews with older moroccans as well to include their viewpoints. This movie is worth watching if you have some time and want to learn about how the USA is viewed abroad.",1406073600,,942,4.850931677018633
8486498,1,B005TQAKMS,"I was looking for a travel documentary. Instead, I found a documentary where they send American students to Morocco to get harassed and preached at by Moroccan students over American Foreign policy. It did not appear a single student had a grasp on foreign politics outside of sensationalized news sources.",1395964800,,306,5.14
