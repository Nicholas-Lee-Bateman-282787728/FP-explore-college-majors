8133800,1,B000GPPPX6,"I give this film one star because there are DJ's on there that I respect, but I think the title is a bit misleading. ""Put the Needle on the Record,"" gives the impression that this is going to be a historical documentary style film that discusses dance music culture as a whole, but it really only covers the Winter Music Conference in Miami, and specifically focuses on the music that was coming out in the early 2000's. By now most of these ""Rock Star DJ's"" have come and gone and most of their contributions towards dance music culture has been forgotten by now. Many of the scenes just show people getting drunk/high and partying, and in MY opinion, that's not what dance music is really about. Props to the film makers FOR AT LEAST ATTEMPTING to do a documentary about Electronic Dance Music, but this is a lot of cheese and very little soul. Now that I think about it, I'm GLAD there hasn't been a proper dance music documentary film made yet, it helps keep this TINY part of the movement underground for just a little while longer.",1330214400,6,1037,4.492063492063492

8133802,4,B000GPPPX6,"This is a great movie about the fourth generation of house music. Anyone who believes that House music was created in LA is sadly mistaken. House music was developed in the houses, garages and clubs of Chicago and Detroit, not Los Angele,s and it was produced for local club-goers in the ""underground"" club scenes, rather than for widespread commercial release. As a result, the recordings were much more conceptual, longer than the music usually played on commercial radio. House, techno, electro and hip-hop musicians used analog synthesizers and sequencers to create and arrange the electronic elements and samples on their tracks. House music ""humanized"" the new electronic instruments by combining live traditional instruments and percussion and soulful vocals with preprogrammed electronic synthesizers and ""beat-boxes"".

The second phase occurred when New York started to create house music. The style of New York house was a little more polished and got the attention of Europe. Italy and the UK started some brilliant house music and then game Germany and Techno.

Techno took the sound and perverted it by increasing the BPM count into something that was not enjoyable to anyone not on X.  I used to throw some of the original raves in South Florida and it started becoming more about the drugs and not the music.  House was in a bad funk for about 10 years. In recent years, starting in the late 90's, DJs and artists such as Miguel Miggs, Blue Six, Aya and others have brought back melodies and rhythms to house.  Along with labels such as Hed Kandi, Lazy Dog and others they have ushered in a new and strong fourth age of house.

8133803,5,B000GPPPX6,"There's a whole new type of dance music being created by DJs in clubs around the world and it's NOT Hip-hop! It's ""House Music"" which is long continuous dance tracks created by DJs in clubs. I didn't even know where the word ""house"" came from until I saw this really well done documentary by a first time director. (It came from the fact that it started in an LA club called ""The Warehouse"", and the music style was shortened to 'house.)

This is not your typical Hip Hop scratching DJ. These guys (and ladies, as there are females as well) blend sounds and beats to form INSTRUMENTAL soundscapes. It's a huge world-wide phenomenon. The interviews with the DJs are ARTICULATE and these guys (and gals) are mostly in their 30s or 40s (or so it appears. This music was new to me but I now understand it thanks to this film. If I had one suggestion it would be to shorten it by about 20 minutes as a few parts are repetitive but, I'm still impressed by the way the story goes. Much of it was filmed at a huge annual House Music Conference in Miami. Parents should be aware that there are some gratuitous shots of topless women on hotel balconies not mentioned on the box. Nice ""eye candy"" but you should know it's there.

I found this even more interesting than the film a few years ago about turntablists ""Scratch"". Give it a shot. The supplemental materials have extended interviews.
