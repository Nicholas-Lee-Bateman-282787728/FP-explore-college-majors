1628763,5,B00005N7Z0,"After reminiscing about this film with some mates, I decided to order it, since amazon had a great price. I hadn't watched it in 25+ years, so expected a cheesy, barely watchable movie. I was absolutely wrong. ""Prancer"" stands up to the test of time, and is a wonderful, heartbreaking family film that I would strongly recommend. While some of the 80's fashions and acting date the film, it stands strong as a holiday family classic!",1514678400,,433,4.7105263157894735
1628764,5,B00005N7Z0,"If people do not like this movie, they must not be paying attention, or they are too young.  It is by far one of the best Christmas movies of all time, altho probably most people don't even know about it.  Prancer should be shown every year on TV, just like Charlie Brown Christmas, Frosty, A Christmas Story.  I think it is best for kids 7 to 12 years old.  I showed this to my fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh grade classes and they loved it, altho a couple of the seventh grade boys had to leave the room when Sam Elliot got teary eyed, so some seventh graders might be a little old for it, and might need to wait until they are adults to enjoy it!  Every actor is perfect for the part. It is a drama, yet comic relief runs thru out.  Need to watch it a couple of times to catch some of the subtlety; this is why it may not hold very young children's attentions. Beautiful winter scenery in Michigan/Indiana, too. I have the VHS and then purchased the DVD in case it broke. A must-have for your collection!",1514592000,,1010,4.2072538860103625

1628769,4,B00005N7Z0,"I'm going to be honest - I tend to cut Christmas movies a little more slack than I do other films when I review them.  Sure, I still expect some modicum of quality (hence why films like ""The Christmas Dragon"" and the ""Santa Clause"" sequels still score low in my book), but come on, these are Christmas movies.  A little cheese and sugary sweetness is to be expected this time of year.  Which is why normally the film ""Prancer"" would score three stars or so... but I grant it an extra star because, for its flaws, it's still a sweet and heartwarming Christmas movie, one that deserves to be a classic.

""Prancer"" centers around Jessie, a brightly optimistic young girl who still wholeheartedly believes in Santa and decorates her room all throughout the year... even as her widowed father (played by Sam Elliot) grumps and worries over both her safety and being able to hold onto their family farm during hard times.  When Jessie discovers a wounded reindeer in the forest, she knows it must be one of Santa's reindeer and hides him in the barn while she nurses him back to health.  Soon both Jessie and Prancer are touching the hearts of their community, including the crotchety old neighbor (Cloris Leachman), an irritable veterinarian (Abe Vigoda), a bewildered mall Santa, and perhaps even her harried father... but can Jessie manage to get Prancer back to Santa before Christmas Eve?  If it really is Prancer after all...

I'll probably catch flack for saying this, but... the young girl playing Jessie is hard to stand.  I understand that child actors aren't always going to be high-quality, but Jessie's shrill voice gets obnoxious fast, and her tendency to yell at everyone around her (father, brother, aunt, best friend, etc.) doesn't help.  And as I get older, I find I identify and sympathize more with her father -- as a child you don't understand why he's so grumpy and gruff all the time, but as an adult you realize that he's a very stressed man still grieving over his wife, and worried about his children's welfare as he struggles to hang on to the family farm.

The acting (aside from the kids) is quite good in this movie, helped by big names such as Sam Elliot, Cloris Leachman, and Abe Vigoda.  No one overacts or hams it up, but plays their roles realistically.  There's a little awkward dialogue here and there, but for the most part the adult actors carry the film well.  The child actors can be wooden, but I can forgive this -- most child actors tend to be a bit stiff, I've found.

And the story of this film is an ultimately uplifting one, showing how a child's faith and wonder can touch many lives.  It can get a bit sappy at times, but for the most part it's a very sweet and touching film, one that isn't afraid to occasionally dip into grittier subject matter (the danger of walking through the woods during hunting season, Jessie getting injured partway through the film, the family's financial straits, etc.).  And the film doesn't rely on animal-based slapstick to get humor as many modern films are won't to do -- yes, Prancer does wreak a little havoc, but its played realistically instead of cartoonishly.

Despite its flaws, ""Prancer"" is a sweet Christmas movie, and deserves to be recognized as a Christmas classic.  And though the main character can be a little shrill and grating, the film has a big heart and a gentle approach to its subject matter that I appreciated.  There's a few tense parts and some blood from a (simulated) animal injury, but for the most part this film is suitable for all ages.",1513814400,,3545,4.6506410256410255

1628782,5,B00005N7Z0,"Perhaps for an urbanized and increasingly godless American society, the love of Christmas may eventually fade to memory.  Contrary to popular banter, Santa, or old St. Nick, is not a secular icon, but the living spirit of giving even a kid can comprehend.  Movies like this help Chistmas live for those who still believe.  If you love Christmas, I think you'll love this movie.  Sam Elliot and the little star are brilliant.

1628794,5,B00005N7Z0,"This movie means a lot to me. I first saw it when I was about ten years old, and I remember whenever my mom usually put a movie on in the background of the house, I'd maybe skim it and then go back to whatever I was doing. But this movie captured me from the very first scene when the little girl, Jessica, is singing in class.

The movie is about a girl named Jessica who lives with her brother and father, her mother having tragically passed away before the start of the movie. She's in a fragile place in her young life, and everything she knows is being tested at lengths she just can'tand won'taccept. When she gets an opportunity to help an injured deer, she consumes the activity wholeheartedly, hoping to bring peace to more than just herself.

It's so incredibly tender and expresses real relationships between friends and family. There's no sugarcoating in the relationship with her father, and it doesn't shy away from the harsh realities and strained relationships families face after a death in the family. That's why I love this movie because it's not cheesy, and it doesn't lie. I didn't grow up like Jessica did, but I've felt her emotions in some capacity, and she has that childlike, stubborn, hopeful innocence that spoke to me when I was youngereven now. And the actress who portrayed Jessica was simply lovely, she was so amazing in that she could pull the emotions from you. If she was upset about something, it made me feel upset; if she was excited, I was excited.

This film is now a Christmas tradition in my family, and my nieces and nephews love it now as I did, and it's so warming to see.",1495843200,,1618,4.496598639455782

Prancer is a movie that I ahve watched almost every year with my family since it came out.  I never tire of it.  The acting (by most of the actors) is superb.  ""Jessica"" is so believable.  A cast of seasoned actors makes this so enjoyable.  I'm 52 years old, and I look forward to watching this movie each year.  A true Christmas classic that is great for the whole family.  Even older folks who don't appreciate cheesy not-so-great Christmas movies will be drawn into this one immediately, and will stay with it until the end.  You'll shed happy tears at the finish.

My daughter fell in love with it at a very young age as she watched Jessica fight as hard as she could to save Prancer. I fell in love with the outstanding performances, especially by the young actress portraying Jessica. I am especially fond of the scenes she shares with Cloris Leachman. Seeing it the first time as a new mother, I appreciated how it handled the idea of Santa Claus.

1628915,4,B00005N7Z0,"I had never seen PRANCER until about 10 years after its initial 1989 release thinking it was about to become a millennium Holiday staple like Miracle 34th Street; and/or It's Wonderful Life.  I decided to purchase PRANCER when I realized I hadn't seen it, again, for the past 5 Christmas'.  I just couldn't find it on tv anywhere.
So, although there are no extras on my 2014 20th Century Fox PRANCER release, the movie - and the ""Something Magical Is About to Happen"" tag line on my PRANCER cover - was definitely worth seeing, again, during this most magical time of the year.
There is also a nice cast of old pro actors to add to the PRANCER experience.
Abe Vigoda (too bad role not bigger) adds a small good part as small town doctor as does Cloris Leachman as a local old recluse who ""used to have the best Christmas lights..."" in the county.
Sam Elliot plays the dad about to lose the farm while trying to understand his day-dreaming 9 year-old daughter (played - not too cute - by Rebecca Harrell). This movie sometimes 'feels' so real with the portrayal of this rather bleak small, snowy town of Three Oaks (it's Michigan actually) that you kinda wonder just how 'real' are they gonna' end this thing?  Director John Hancock and Photographer Misha Suslov deserve mention for this mood of believe-ability.  It's no wonder the dad is  prepared to send his daughter to live with her Aunt (Rutanya Alda) ""till things get better.""  Even the apple tree that is supposed to help sustain them through the winter looks sickly.

By the way movie buffs may recognize the blonde girl (Arianna Richards) who is best friends with Jessica (Rebecca Harrell) as one of the star children from/in Spielberg's first Jurassic Park (about 3 years after her appearance in PRANCER).  The 9 year-old girls have a mature, priceless scene debating whether there is a God, Heaven, or Santa Claus that creates a rift between the friends.  Johnny Galecki (Big Bang Theory) also has very small role as somewhat antagonistic schoolmate.
And, call me a sap, but Prancer does tug on the holiday heartstrings.  Got me again, especially when the town's people...well, I'm saying too much..  This is a good Holiday movie that is surprisingly realistic in its Three Oaks, farm town portrayal of a little girl struggling to enjoy Christmas as she does her best to mend a ""real"" reindeer...without her mom...
My eyes jut might well-up again if I'm not careful.
Good movie.  It really is (even with one silly the house has to be wrecked THAT easily sequence).  Great performance by ""Boo"" the reindeer.  No puppets or computer graphics in this one.
Happy Holidays Everyone.",1480723200,,2638,4.756578947368421

1628980,5,B00005N7Z0,"Prancer is another one of those heartwarming Christmas movies from yesteryear that have a true feel-good quality about them. Although I watched this movie years ago at the age of 11, I watched it again recently. It almost made me nostalgic for a simpler time before all the craziness of our modern technological world.

Young Rebecca Harrell does a great job of playing Jessica Riggs. Sam Elliot, one of my favourite actors of all time (and one of the most underrated) shines in his role as a hardworking widowed father who while coming across as angry, only wants to protect his children. And then there's legendary actress Cloris Leachman, who adds an interesting angle to the story.

It's hard to believe that 1989 was 27 years ago. What's even sadder is that good wholesome films such as Prancer are rarely produced by Hollywood anymore. Around this time of year, in order to escape the busyness of our modern age, I like to rent or watch on Nexflix an old Christmas flick such as this one. It's nice to relax and go back to a different time. In the movie, kids weren't playing on Iphones or had their heads in front of computers as is the case today. They played outside and with toys. It'd be nice if society could return to such an innocent age.",1453420800,,1252,4.56

Great telling of Prancer and a little girl who lost her mother but gained so much in the end. Rebecca Harrell Tickell is so adorable you can't help but love her! She won a Young Artist Award nomination for ""Best Young Actress Starring In A Motion Picture "" for this- her first role ever. Abe Vigoda is at his best, can't be bothered , but kind and gentle too. The animals are also well trained and are sweet in the storyline. Can't say enough about it, me and my big family all loved it when we were little and treasure it now. Thank you for reading this .

1628994,1,B00005N7Z0,"This is the worst Christmas movie ever.  The story has potential but it's not well realized.  The movie's only redeeming feature is the young actress who plays the little girl.  Everyone else is written and acted in such a stereotypical fashion as to make the whole thing ludicrous.  It has about as much depth as an episode of the Flintstones.  In addition, I have little doubt that the titular reindeer was mistreated during production in order to get her (female reindeer are the only ones to have antlers in the winter) to limp like she's injured.  Avoid this awful holiday cash-in.",1450915200,,586,4.752475247524752

1629109,5,B00005N7Z0,"Young Jessica Riggs could give lessons in believing in Santa Claus and she certainly tries to:  to her best friend, to anyone who will listen and many who will not.  She's always at odds with her father, who is still grieving and confused over losing his wife.  Jessica is sure her mother is in heaven and that one of Santa's reindeer is hurt and living in the woods nearby.  The fact that no one believes her doesn't stop her from looking, even when her father tells her that a hunter could shoot her out there.

  This is another Christmas classic, yes a little darker than the typical kid's Christmas movies, but very good nonetheless.  The musical score was done by the late Maurice Jarre (who did the score for ""Dr. Zhivago"" and many other great films) -- it is different, but fits the mood of the movie.

  The actress who plays Jessica does a superb job and the movie revolves around her -- we see pretty much everything through her young eyes.  The rest of the cast is very good, with some veteran performers playing key roles -- Sam Elliott plays her father and Abe Vigoda, Michael Constantine and Cloris Leachman also have vital roles to play.

  It is a little darker, as I've said, but overall should be suitable for all members of the family and well worth the viewing.",1420588800,,1282,4.489177489177489

1629139,5,B00005N7Z0,"I saw this as a child in 1989.  I loved it then, and still love it now.  This movie includes fantasy, family dynamics, and faith.  There are elements in it that may remind one of ET and Pollyanna.  It is a re-visit to childhood through Jessica Riggs eyes, a child that can touch even the most unreachable hearts, on and off-screen.  A child faced with many obstacles, Jessie still holds onto her Christmas spirit and comes to Prancer's aid when the magical reindeer makes an unintentional stop in her town.  It is a totally original story, not a remake.  So if you are looking for a great Christmas movie full of hope and magic, give this a try.  My kids loved it too!

1629186,5,B00005N7Z0,"This movie came out the same year that I was born. I saw this movie back in elamentry school on the day school let out for Christmas break. I think that Sam Elliot is one of greatest actors. For some reason, the ending reminded me so much of the ending of the movie ""Radio Flyer"" accept that this movie was much better than ""Radio Flyer"".  I recently purchased this DVD as a gift for my sister. Her birthday is coming up next month and I wanted to buy and collect some movies for her. I figured since her birthday comes around Christmas time, Why not get her a Christmas movie as well. I know that she will really enjoy this movie if she has not seen it yet!!!!!!!!!!!! God Bless ""Prancer"". Peter Smith

Update for 12/17/2014 I Bought 3 more copies of this DVD. 2 of them are for gifts, and 1 to keep for my collection. 1, I am giving as a gift to my grandma, and the third one, I had sent as a pre Christmas gift to my aunt and uncle who live all the way up in Montana!!!!!!!!!!!

Without giving away the storyline, let me just say that this movie, about ideals, Christmas, the loss of a mother & a wife, tough economic times, and a special small town, are all reasons to add this gem to your movie collection.

I wouldn't categorize it with the Christmas greats primarily because there is so much sadness and misunderstanding in the plot.  A lonely little girl finds a wounded reindeer, which she believes is Prancer, and nurses it back to health,  She faces one obstacle after another in trying to return the reindeer she believes is Prancer to Santa.  Everyone eventually comes to support the child restoring faith in the magic of Christmas and hope for the future.

However, although I recalled it being just ""okay"", I have to admit that after purchasing this for her (we pickup a few Christmas titles every year), I don't mind it at all. Not a great picture, but definitely a sweet tale of childhood loss and how this is used to bring back lost love. Young actress, Rebecca Harrell Tickell, is who makes the movie work. Definitely worth a look. My wife now watches it every Christmas Eve ... which means, actually, that ""we"" watch it every Christmas Eve. Not too shabby.",1358208000,,568,4.471153846153846

THE FATHER FAILS TO BE A FATHER WHILE HE STRUGGLES TO MAKE A LIVING ON THEIR FARM AND WITH THE ABSENCE OF HIS WIFE. I DIDN'T LIKE THE USE OF OMG SO CARELESSLY SAID BY JESSICA'S FRIEND AND HER LOFTY OPINION OF GOD AND HEAVEN NOT EXISTING. BUT JESSICA PROMPTLY MADE HER RETHINK THAT. ANOTHER ASPECT I LOVED OF THIS MOVIE WAS THAT IT HAD REAL LOOKING PERSONS, WITHOUT MAKE UP, AND DRESSED FOR RURAL AND SMALL TOWN LIVING. THE SCHOOL LOOKED REAL AND SO WAS THE FARM HOUSE WHICH I LOVED FOR ITS QUAINT OLD FASHIONED LOOK. THE SETTING WAS ON A FARM AND AND NEARBY WOODS IN WINTERTIME.THEY EVEN HAD THE CORRECT VERSION OF A  REINDEER.  THE OLD VET WAS JUST LIKE AN OLDER OVERWORKED COUNTRY VET.  CLORIS LEACHMAN WAS GREAT IN HER CHARACTER AS THE OFF BEAT, ISOLATED NEIGHBOR.

1629389,5,B00005N7Z0,"I first saw Prancer in the theatre in 1989 when it was originally released. I love Christmas films, but it is rare to find one that is this well acted. The story is not only heartwarming, it is heartwrenching. Rebecca Harrell's performance as Jessica Riggs is among the finest child performances I've ever seen on film; she's a complete natural - it's as though she isn't even acting at all. While a lot of people would write Prancer off as just another sappy Christmas film, I completely disagree. In my humble opinion, Sam Elliott gives one of the finest performances of his career, as a widowed farmer, struggling desperately to make ends meet and provide for his young daughter, with whom he has constant conflict, doesn't understand, and feels would be better off living with her aunt. Cloris Leachman also turns in a fine performance as a lonely hermit, whom all the children in town are afraid of, not understanding the character has at some point suffered greatly, a multitude of unspoken layers. Young Jessie loves Christmas more than anything in the world and when she discovers an injured reindeer, she is convinced that he is Prancer, that Santa is missing him, and that she must do everything in her power to return the reindeer to Santa before Christmas Eve. Much of the conflict between Jessie and her father stem from this, as he wishes to shoot the deer, thus putting it out of its misery. So it's up to Jessie to not only hide the deer from her father, but nurse it back to health in hopes of returning him to Santa. Even now, as an adult, I cannot watch this film without ultimately sobbing. Not only is it among the finest Christmas films I've ever seen, but it is one of the finest stories I've ever seen about a family struggling through hard times in general, it felt real, the performances were genuine, and I could personally relate to the characters. I remember Prancer being unavailable for many years as it was released by Nelson Entertainment (I believe) and when that company went under Prancer became unattainable. Finally MGM gained the rights to the film and released it. And it's still a very difficult film to find. Netflix does not even carry it, so I was happy to see it here on Amazon. I was also happy to find the film in widescreen. My only real complaint would be that there are no other special features on the dvd. Still, at a wonderfully cheap price, if you are looking for a touching, realistic, heartwarming family film - I give Prancer my highest recommendation.",1356825600,,2509,4.640449438202247

1629426,4,B00005N7Z0,"This is a cute family movie which offers good messages about why familes should stick together & support one another. Not only will the kids enjoy this, but parents will, too. ""Prancer"" reminds us to open our minds & have some imagination, because as we get older, some of us tend to lose that. The film is not depressing, however, it's also not super upbeat, so if you're looking for something fun & happy, you may want to take an alternate route, but I personally feel it's worth watching. I saw this when I was about 5 & enjoyed it as a child & I still enjoy watching it around Christmastime now as an adult.

The DVD: Works very well, I've watched it a couple of times without any issues. It's not HD but the quality is still fine.

It is a wonderful movie, The only thing is that the schools are like they used to be when I was growing up and I am in my 50's. BUT. . . I think that the wonderfulness and magical quality of this movie can be enjoyed by more than just people that believe in Christmas. You have to look beyond just the Christian concept.

1629453,2,B00005N7Z0,"I watched this when my daughter was younger and I really think that my biggest issue with the film, aside from the promotion of the existence of Santa Claus, lies with the depiction of the father as a bad man. I think that, given the circumstances of losing his wife, struggling financially, trying to make ends meet and provide for his family, he was simply prone to the frustration and desperation that come with these types of problems. I don't see him as cold or uncaring, as the film makes him out to be. He became upset with Jessica for wandering out in the woods by herself because he knew that she could have been shot or even killed by hunters. He wanted her to have a mother figure in her life and the aunt was no doubt the closest he could come to providing that. I don't know of too many men who show their emotions publicly on a regular basis, so I don't think he's alone in that regard, either. He was simply trying to do the best he could with what he had while protecting a child who was given to imagination and wanderings into dangerous areas.

Rated G.

Tagline: Something magical is about to happen.

Unique with a touch of magic rather than sappy sentiment.
This is not a commercial Christmas movie. There are plenty of those.
This is a dark fable about redemption.
A lonely eight year old girl named Jessica discovers a mysterious and injured raindeer in the forest and is convinced that it's Prancer, Santa's own. She's determiined  to nurse it back to health by hook or by crook and to return it to Santa before Christmas day.
Her mother has died recently and her father is having troubles with their failing farm, along with now having to raise a young daughter and son all alone in rural Michigan. He has become embittered with his lot in life.
However,  innocent Jessica has a special kind of faith and hope and belief that's all her own during this trying holiday season. And, unexpectedly,  their small town cannot help but sit up and take notice.
This film seems more or less geared toward kids as well as  adults due to the honest grief that's depicted in some scenes.
The winter scenery is lovely to behold.
Jessica never loses faith in her belief, and her father soon rediscovers something about his daughter and himself that he had been too stubborn to admit to her or to even to himself.
It's been said that the magic of Christmas resides in the heart of a child. If this is true,  then there can be no better gift for anyone to behold,  when a 8-year-old girl's spirit shows everyone around her that a miracle can still happen.
This film is truly a holiday favorite for many households.",1330128000,,1631,4.631944444444445

Brought it home, watched it, and loved it. Well, since then we've moved a couple times and somehow the movie just disappeared.

We've thought about it often and I went online to try and find it. But just wasn't able to find it. Then I went to Amazon and was amazed that they had it. I thought for sure, like some other movies I've lost that it would never be put on DVD. But here it was.

I ordered it for a Christmas present for my wife, who was so overjoyed at being able to have it again. We watched it again, reliving both the good times and bad times leading up to Christmas.

1629536,5,B00005N7Z0,"Of all the classic Christmas movies we have in our family collection, including Blu-ray versions, this is one we always return to. In keeping with other classic films like 'It's a Wonderful Life,' the production's realism in 'Prancer' stirs our emotions into repeated viewing and holds our interest, as we escape into someone's else's difficulties other than our own for awhile. We figure, if they can make it through a cold harsh winter, then perhaps there's hope for us, too.

On a subliminal emotional level, hard times effect us all, no matter what our economic, social or familial status might be. Identifying with life's difficulties has become routine, even for those who purportedly have it all. If life were always easy street, then one would just not really be experiencing life. Just like daily consumption becomes boring, it's nice when positive incentives come around now and then to take off the edge and the struggle we all face. Reaping the fruits of our labor lifts us and is well worth the wait. Still, family is more important than money, pleasure, self-indulgence and things.

There are many little glimpses of metaphors during the film and, because they are not in your face, it makes for a compelling piece. The nighttime setting throughout most of the film adds to the sobering, yet opposite homey and warm feeling mood of the film. It symbolizes that, no matter how cold it is outside and how rough it may get, there is always someone, somewhere who will be there to protect you, care for you, and invite you in; even when hope seems like it will indefinitely remain aloof and elusive. Looking outside ourselves by reaching out to others' human need gives us sense and purpose, often healing our own personal grief and hopelessness.",1321833600,,1756,4.869565217391305
1629537,5,B00005N7Z0,"This video is great, full of exterior shots of winter and small town Christmas many may remember in their past as children.

It is a nicely woven story about a family and neighbors and townspeople that shows how nice things can be in life especially during Christmas.

It also does a good job of entertaining young children like my grandchildren so it keeps there interest througout the film, one thing they loved was the sleigh ride down the hill through a not so friendly neighbor's property, who then becomes a more friendly neighbor when her house is done up in long stored away Christmas Decorations as the story progresses around ""Prancer"" more and more throughout the film.

Children will love it and at least ""This"" adult did too, first saw it on VHS many years ago when my wife brought it home and never fogot it and decided to find it on DVD for the youngest grandchildren to view.

This is the 1989 release, the Original but the newer release refers back to this one so purchasing both was the way I went, didn't know about the referring back until I previewed it days from receiving it in the mail [Prancer Returns]..

In short they make a good set for Christmas time viewing for an entire family, exterior shots are breath taking as live scenes show cold weather, snow and even a real town which will be identified by name in the credits in case anyone is curious.

The actors are perfect in their respective roles so I doubt anyone with ""Christmas Spirit"" will dislike this video...

The value comes from the opportunity to help children understand that, despite the ""tinsel"" (flimsy Pollyanna themes) commonly used in Christmas stories, there are real difficulties that families face and are often brought to the surface during the holidays.  There are many teaching moments in the film, including the sensitivity to poverty, seniors, animals, hope and despair in the holidays, sibling conflict, and tender reconciliation and forgiveness.  This film is better for the more mature youngster, perhaps age 9 and above.  Rebecca Harrelson, the brilliantly directed young lead, is showcased in the outstanding light of stars Sam Elliott, Cloris Leachman, and Abe Vigoda.

Not only do I admire it for the acting and the plot, but I also love the atmosphere and the scenery. This isn't a loud, bombastic Christmas tale that's filled with cheer. This is a very tranquil film that's filled with beautiful scenery. The shots of the silent, solemn winter woods is something that you don't usually see in today's family features. The mysterious reindeer is also a sight to see when it slowly wanders in one of the coldest realms of nature.

Rebecca Harrell, who plays Jessica, is still spectacular when seen onscreen. Her chemistry with her father (Sam Elliot) and a veterinarian (Abe Vigoda) really makes the film even better. I'm still wondering whatever happened to the actress after this film was released.

So I would say that ""Prancer"" is a beautiful family film. It's an excellent mix of family & friendship, and stunning scenery. It's certainly better than most over-the-top Christmas films that are seen in today's generation.",1246838400,,1066,4.788043478260869

1629685,4,B00005N7Z0,"It is getting close to Christmas, which means that it is Jessica Riggs' (Rebecca Harrell) favorite season.  The eight-year-old knows things are hard at home.  After all, her mother had died and her father John (Sam Elliott) is having a hard time making ends meet on the family apple farm.

One day, Jessica sees a reindeer roaming through the woods.  She immediately decides it is Prancer since it looks like a picture she has of Santa's reindeer and since she saw the plastic Prancer fall from the town's Christmas display a few days ago.

When she finds the reindeer again a few days later in the family barn, she quickly moves him to the shed and tries to nurse him back to health in time to join Santa on Christmas Eve.  Can she do it without her father finding out?  Is it really Prancer?

I've been meaning to watch this film since it came out 20 years ago and finally sat down and did just that.  I will admit it was much more serious then I expected it to be.  Jessica's home life is pretty serious with John even thinking it might be better if she went to live with her aunt.  Additionally, there is a strong theme about faith and reality, played out most obviously when Jessica's best friend announces she no longer believes in Santa or God.

And yet this movie isn't all sadness.  Jessica's enthusiasm and faith is actually heart warming.  And her spirit rubs off on several characters of the course of the movie.  I especially enjoyed the scenes with Cloris Leachman's hermit of a neighbor.  The ending is completely satisfying.  In fact, I bet it would be hard to watch it and not be moved to tears (in a good way).

If you want something different with a bit of a serious bent to it, check this movie out.  It's an enjoyable Christmas escape with a bit more of the real world thrown in.",1231804800,,1800,4.416413373860182

1.  There is NO Santa Clause
2.  How could Santa go down all the chimney's in the world in 1 night, it's not logical
3.  There also is NO GOD
4.  And NO HEAVEN

This becomes especially upsetting in the movie because the child who is being told this, sadly exclaims, ""this(no heaven)can't be true because what about my mom?"" (Her mom is dead and the child had previously thought her mom was in Heaven.)  This sad, upset child then tells the other child, ""You are not my friend anymore.""

At this point, I ejected the movie from the DVD player.  My kids were bewildered and upset.

OK so that wasn't such a key scene but the last one....when they lead Prancer to Antler Ridge and he flies off up into the moon...that is NOT the last scene. Remember at the beginning they show the town officials decorating with the big santa sleigh and reindeers and one of the reindeer falls to the ground and Jessica says it's Prancer and the town guys say they aren't going to fix it?

1629716,5,B00005N7Z0,"Christmas is merely a backdrop for what is a deeper and well done movie about family dynamics. Sam Elliott gives a masterful performance playing a tough Dad in a tough situation. He's unable to explain or express his emotions - his wife has died recently and he cannot make enough money from his apple farm to support his daughter and her older brother. He has tough decisions ahead and is grittily bound by the realities of his Earthly life.

His daughter, meanwhile, is full of wonder, unbounded joy and optimism. The contrast between her world and his is striking, as Elliott reaches the point where he decides he has to send his daughter away to live with the aunt, because he simply can't provide for her.

Being a father, this hits home real deep.

There are many other layers to the film and many twists and turns along the way. But beyond the magic of Christmas is the father's ultimate realization that he can't live without his daughter - she's the one spark of life left out there for him. She, by the power of her incredible spirit, redeems him, heals him, and let's him break down and grieve openly.

With three kids ages 16, 14 and 10, I watch and have watched many many ""kid/teenage movies."" A big complaint that I have is that in 9 out of 10 of them the Dad is stupid, evil, clueless, or some other form of the bad guy. In this movie, the Dad starts out as uncaring and unfeeling but there is more of a gritty realism to it. (The  film itself reinforces this - it's cold and somewhat grim and often nighttime - you do NOT get the feeling that this is a ""Hollywoood"" movie) These are apple farmers out in the sticks and they are fighting to make ends meet. They are poor. The Dad is mean in alot of the film but because he is down on his luck and broken through circumstance, not cluelessness. His salvation and rebirth is a big part  of what this movie (and  Christmas) is about.

1629758,5,B00005N7Z0,"First of all, before I go on, I must say that the music score in Prancer by Maurice Jarre (father of world famous keyboardist Jean-Michel Jarre) is just superb. The haunting score is played throughout the film, and it gets me every time.

I can't get through this film without totally breaking down (and I'm a 50 year old 250 lb guy). I think it has a lot to do with the music, but also the story of a child's love for an animal. This is the only film I totally cry over, so much so I haven't watched it on over 5 years until I saw it again on TV and it gets to me the same way it did over 10 years ago when I first saw it.

The film is dark (not the story but the film itself) and it really works as I can almost feel being there in the snow covered hills of Michigan where the story takes place. I can feel the cold air as the scenery in the way it's depicted in the film is remarkable. Up until the very end, this is the most realistic film of any genre out there.

I will watch them alone, I will watch them with my kids, I will make my husband watch them with me.  So when I say this is a good family movie, please understand my bias.  I am not talking about the cinematography or the well-crafted plot.  It's just a nice show to watch at Christmas time.  However, I definitely think it is for older kids.  We watched it with our almost-5 yr old and almost-3 yr old and had to talk loudly over several parts so they wouldn't hear.  There is a lot of discussion about doubting Santa (why do they have to put that doubt in almost every Christmas movie ?) and my kids are in the awed belief stage, so I didn't want them to hear that.  Also, the girl's mother is dead, and my kids weren't old enough to quite grasp that, and I didn't see a reason to explain that to them yet.  The little girl definitely sneaks around and lies to her father, too, and he is getting ready to send her off to live with her aunt.  All ends happily, of course, but I think we'll wait until the kids are about 8 or so before we watch this one again.  I'll probably wait until they've already stopped believing in Santa or, at least, they've already questioned it a few times and aren't sure whether to believe.",1196812800,,1300,4.222672064777328

1629761,4,B00005N7Z0,"Not a Christmas tale properly speaking,
but rather a family drama with a vague Christmas setting.
The innocence and faith of a young girl enlightens the lives
of her unhappy father (a widower experiencing financial
and emotional problems), an old woman who has become
a bitter recluse and many other of the people inhabiting
the seemingly idyllic American town they live in.

The young girl becomes convinced that an injured reindeer
is the mythical, magical flying reindeer, Prancer,
that is part of a team of reindeer that pull the sled
of the elf, Santa Claus, on Christmas Eve to deliver
gifts and is committed to nursing it back to health
at the family farm.

It would be best not to give away too much, so I won't,
but I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this film.
It is not specifically a children's film,
but children will enjoy it, as will adults.

This is a well done movie, although not a masterpiece of film art.
The acting is excellent across the board.
Sam Elliot is perfect for the role of the father
as is Cloris Leachman as the recluse old woman.
Rebecca Harrell is totally charming as the young girl, Jessica.
I loved Abe Vagoda as the reluctant, grumpy old veterinarian.

Generally realistic, and not sappy, this is a touching movie that will grab just about anyone's heart.  There is fine acting - Sam Elliot does a fantastic job playing a widowed, apple farming, barely able to make it father, and 9 year old Rebecca Harrell plays a completely believable girl who has found and nursed back to health the injured Prancer.  Her realism is second only to her resolve to make sure Prancer is reunited with Santa before the close of Christmas.  The movie was filmed in and around Three Oaks, Michigan (15 miles from my home).  A small, quiet village of less than 1800 people in an agricultural area, where we do grow apples among other things, and really have a Drier's Meat Market.

1629788,5,B00005N7Z0,"I was reluctant to watch ""Prancer"".  I expected it to be an (another) overly sentimental and unrealistic Christiams movie.  I was wrong.  ""Prancer"" is a wonderful picture, and it brings out everything that is right and good about Christmas.

It's the story about a real live reindeer that, for some reason, has strayed far south from its natural habitat.  An 8 year old girl (Jessica) happens across him in the woods, and she is convinced that he is Prancer ... one of Santa's reindeer.  Later the animal somehow gets wounded and mysteriously turns up at Jessica's home, where her father ... should he ever discover the reindeer there ... would shoot him.  Jessica decides to nurse Prancer back to health (in secret) and then return him to Santa in time for his important Christmas Eve trip.

The reindeer has the title role here, but the girl who plays Jessica (Rebecca Harrell) is the star of the movie.  She gives a very believable and very touching performance, and, if you have a heart ... no matter how small ... she will find it, take it with her, and put it in the pocket of her winter coat ... the very same pocket where she keeps her ... spare halo.

She is surrounded by some pretty good performers here.  Sam Elliott plays her dad, and he is excellent, though a bit scary for the first ... 95% of the movie.  Cloris Leachman plays an eccentric old shut-in whose life is touched by the little girl.  Abe Vigoda is excellent (in a small part) as the veterinarian, and Michael Constantine (in an even smaller part) plays a department store Santa.

""Prancer"" never falls into the ""mushy"" trap ... which would have been easy to do.  Everything is kept realistic and believable, which is likely due to the efforts of the director, John Hancock.  The setting is small town America in winter (Vermont maybe?) and everything that is shown to us rings true.

But ""Prancer"" can legitimately be called a Christmas classic ... a movie that families (and those wishing to have a family) can watch for years to come.",1159574400,,2013,4.609550561797753

Whether the reindeer involved is really the magical Prancer, we want to believe along with Jessica that he is.  Sam Elliott plays the gruff father, a widower faced with losing his apple farm, and who has become embittered towares life.  A glowing supporting cast including Cloris Leachman as a dotty old lady; Rutanya Alda as Jessie's sweet Aunt Sarah and Abe Vigoda as a crotchety veterinarian lends fine mettle to the proceedings.  PRANCER succeeds because it's really an examination of family values, the need for love and acceptance and that childhood whimsy of belief in what may seem impossible.

I was just a selfish kid then and have no idea why this film spoke so strongly to me, but I think often of that moment. With a six-month-old son now I see everything with different eyes and wish for him to be able to live as long as possible in Jessie's world because it is rough work in the apple orchard.

1629824,5,B00005N7Z0,"""Prancer is one of the sweetest holiday movies I have ever seen, and also one of my favorites. It is very sensitive and captures those precious and heartwarming aspects of Christmas that make a good holiday film. I remember watching this with my mom when I was younger, and we still like to pull it out during the Christmas season; it will always be special to us.
The story is simple yet enchanting: a gruff, headstrong, and somewhat distant single father is trying to keep up his declining farm as he struggles to raise his two young children. His 8-year-old daughter Jessica, the evident strength of the family, is a lonely yet faithful little girl trying to cope with her mother's death while doing her best to keep the spirit alive for the approaching holiday season. When she finds an injured reindeer in the forest, she clings to the idea that it is Santa's ""Prancer,"" and she takes it upon herself to bring him home and nurse him back to health so that Santa can come for him on Christmas Eve. Prancer becomes a friend and a source of comfort as Jessica struggles to make believers out of her family and friends; however, when Jessica is injured herself and loses much of her faith in Prancer, it is the people around her who must convince her to once again believe in the magic of Christmas.
The storyline is beautiful, and the acting is strong. Little Rebecca Harrell is perhaps one of the most endearing child actresses I have seen in any film. Her personality and strength of character with the role of Jessica in this movie is different than what you typically see; she will melt your heart and warm your soul. Sam Elliott is also very consistent and good in his very complex and difficult role as Jessica's father, a seemingly hard man with a special softness deep inside that only his spirited little daughter can bring out. The other actors and actresses help hold the movie together and make it the endearing family film that it is. This is truly a very special holiday film that the WHOLE family can watch together and enjoy, and I recommend it for the upcoming holiday season!!!!",1037491200,,2098,4.597333333333333

Jessie has recently lost her mother, and now she and her brother and father are alone.  Because crops are failing, her father decides she is to go live with her Aunt Sarah, but Jessie doesn't want that.  She proves to her father and everyone around her that she is needed at home with her brother and dad, not with her Aunt Sarah.  She further proves the bond between people in a small town and how they stand up for each other in a time of crisis.
Her favorite story is the story of a little girl named Virginia, a true life child who wrote a letter to Santa Claus, and the letter wound up in the hands of a newspaper editor.  She wanted to prove there really was a Santa Claus and the newspaper editor said, ""Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus...""  This true life story happened around 1900.  So when Jessie goes to visit the ""helping"" Santa Claus at the mall, she tells him to deliver a letter to the ""real"" Santa, that she has Prancer and that she wants to meet Santa up on a cliff so that Prancer can be reunited with Santa.  This letter finds ITS way to a newspaper editor, and before long the entire town knows about this loveable reindeer.

1629850,4,B00005N7Z0,"Actually, I give this movie 4 1/2 stars. I enjoyed ""E.T."" as a child, but as an adult I find it slow. This movie follows the same pattern and improves on it. (An innocent child is having a difficult life; a child hood fantasy intervenes; the child's dedication to their childhood fantasy influences the people around them for the better.) The scenery is gorgeous, and the music (without a lot of effects) is perfect. Sam Elliott performs his role to perfection. While he seems harsh and stern, his behavior is understandable. We can see that he deeply misses his wife, and that he is struggling to support his children. The scene where Jessica spends time with her mother's picture is short but well done. It is interesting how Jessica is able to link her faith in heaven with her belief in Santa. Also notable is the fact that even though the people in town probably do not believe (at first anyway) that the reindeer is Santa's, they are deeply moved by Jessica's dedication to it. One deeply moving scene is when Jessica is desperate to make money to feed Prancer. Her fear of Cloris Leachman has already been established, and she dares another meeting to Cloris when she becomes desperate for the reindeer's well being. It is also moving that we get to know Cloris, and she too is moved by Jessica to the point that she reenters society. The ending where the reindeer's role reconciles Jessica and her father is infinitely touching. (In ""E.T."" too much of the plot revolves around E.T.'s role as an alien. In this movie the situation between Jessica and the people around her is more emphasized. The reindeer accomplishes his purpose without stealing the movie. Even when we find out that the reindeer really is Prancer, the scene is done short and exquisitely. We see Santa's sleigh fly by, and the plot returns to Jessica and her father.) My only complaint about this movie is that Cloris Leachman could have been explained more. The author would have done good to tell us (even if only briefly) why she lives the way she does. If the author had done this, I would have considered this an exquisite masterpiece. This is probably one of the best Christmas movies ever made.",976406400,,2178,4.674479166666667

A little girl with the help of a reindeer, named Prancer, renews the Christmas Spirit in an entire town!  Faith is the key here, and when you watch this DVD, your faith will certainly be rekindled.  A box of tissues will come in handy.",1520812800,,320,4.482758620689655
