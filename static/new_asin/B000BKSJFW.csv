8088046,5,B000BKSJFW,"Four episodes from the series, most of them excellently done. Given that this was aimed at a pre-teen Japanese audience, it works very well. Avoid the English hub, since it just kind of riffs on the action, rather disrespectfully.",1488758400,,230,4.923076923076923

8088049,4,B000BKSJFW,Love the satire.  But the earlier series were not as funny as season 4 and 5.  Wait for them to drop under $15.,1367971200,,111,3.782608695652174
8088050,5,B000BKSJFW,"I loved Ghost stories...I saw half this one and half the original at the theatre before this even came out. Of course, as soon as I had the money, I had to get it...this is the most hillarious thing ever put out by ADV, as long as you don't like watching in Japanese. (The original dub sux)",1154563200,,290,4.105263157894737
8088051,5,B000BKSJFW,GHOST STORIES SEMESTER 2: SOPHOMORE SCARES is anime at its best: humor blends with intrigue and zany plots as a little brother is beat up again and Satsuki decides to toughen him up - by helping him outrun the ghost who likes to chop off runners' feet.,1145404800,,252,4.382978723404255
8088052,5,B000BKSJFW,"I was very pleased with the second volume of this anime. First, it is down right funny. Many times, you just don't get the jokes in an anime or they are really dumb. This is not true of this anime. The jokes are very contempary.

Secondly, the story stats strong and they stick to the plot. I can't speak for the Japanese version but the American version, the plot is solid.

Thirdly, if you are a fan of the anime series ""Chrono Crussade"", you will be pleased to know, two of the voice acotrs from Chrono Crussade"" are in ""Ghost Stories"" which are Hilary Hoag(Sister Rosette) and Greg Ayers(Chrono).  It is very easy to identify which character's voices they are.

Another reason I like this anime is because of the extras on the disc. If you go to the extras and clikc the ghost profiles, they give you a summary of the ghosts they use in the anime. These ghosts are famous ghost stoires and legends in Japan. I particullarly like it because I like learning about different ghost sotires from different places. I also like that the characters are becoming more developed through storyline. If you like the first volume of Ghost Stories, pick up the second volume. You won't be disappointed.",1140393600,2,1192,4.582159624413146
