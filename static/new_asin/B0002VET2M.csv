2125097,5,B0002VET2M,"Having watched this set over like 50 times I can now review it! If you are unfamiliar with the show, well get familiar with it. start watching it. You'll figure it out. This set features Attack of the Giant Leeches, Gunslinger, Mr. B's Lost Shorts, and Teenagers from Outer Space.

Attack of the Giant Leeches: Roger Corman executive produced this flick about men in octopus-like ""Leech"" costumes terrorizing residents of a swamp. When irradiated leeches grow huge in a Southern bayou, a local storekeeper sees his chance to be rid of his trashy, two-timing wife--feed her to the leeches!

Rating: 4/5 - The jokes and the comments are delivered experetly and dude is it ever funny. Even the movie itself is hysterical. The short in the beggining is quite funny, ""we're walking really really fast"" it's great. The monsters look like garbage bags with popcorn bowls glued on, the plot line was very hard to any find. A few slow parts, but all in all an enjoyable episode.

Gunslinger: Cult bombshells Beverly Garland and Allison Hayes star in this low-budget panthecolor feminist Western directed by Roger Corman. When the marshal of Oracle, Texas, is killed by a hired gunman, his quick-shooting widow, Rose (Garland), straps on his gun and star, puts on some pants, and aims to find out who did the hiring. The likely culprit is Erica (Hayes), a buxom saloon owner involved in crooked land schemes. When Rose starts getting too nosy, Erica hires another gunslinger, Tombstone legend Caine Miro (John Ireland), to take care of her. Instead of killing Rose, though, he ends up falling in love with her, and the stage is set for a gunpowder-fueled showdown between the women and Caine. Corman's seventh film was plagued by rains during the mostly outdoor shooting, which gives the film a muddy look unusual for a Western. Plenty of gunplay, fistfighting, and surprisingly intelligent dialogue helps, as does the film's strong profeminist stance, with Rose capably shooting bad guys left and right yet losing none of her womanly tenderness.

Rating: 5/5 -

Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo are subjected to THE GUNSLINGER, a Roger Corman cheapie western featuring Beverly Garland as a woman who takes over as sheriff from her dead husband. The jokes are great and are delivered perfectly. This is one of the funniest episodes ever done. They did a really nice job on this one.

Mr. B's Lost Shorts: This is just a collection of shorts.

Ok they are all good and all but the true gem on this is Mr. B Natural. This IS the funniest short they ever did. It was literally a tear jerking, gut busting, totall on the floor laughfest! I loved every minute of us. I hurt after watching this one from laughing so hard. The Spirit of Music ruthlessly stalks a nerdy, awkward adolscent until the lad realizes that his whole life could change the very instant he picks up that trumpet. Now this is suppose to be a guy, but it is in fact a gender confused women who so happy, peppy, and perky it drives one INSANE! The dancing in it is by far the most disturbing thing ever put on film. No joke.

Teenagers from Outer Space: As if those on earth weren't strange enough, these alien delinquints plot to exploit our planet as feeding ground for their humanivorous Gargon herds which, curiously appear as mere lobsters. The space ship looks like a sun hate and is like 4 feet in diameter, but somehow when you're in it, it's like 20 feet. Thew teens look like they're in there 20s and thirties. This insidious force means to decimate our world simply to feed theirs. Only the rebellious Derek second guesses the fiendish plot of his people. Surprisingly the humans are very, well, KIND! Heck, they even rent out a room to him knowing that he couldn't pay for it. They also don't ask many questions about his ""uniform,"" which looks strangely like a jumpsuit belted at the waste. Then the bully from the guide ship shows up and zaps people into skeletons all over town. Will derek finally fess up to who he really is? More importantly, can even he destroy the universe's deadliest shellfish? All this and good ol' teenage heartbreak, too.

Rating: 5/5

OVERALL RATING: 5/5

I quite enjoyed this set and strongly recomend it to any fans of the show.",1106956800,3,4219,4.710990502035278
2125098,5,B0002VET2M,"""Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection Volume 6"" from Rhino is another good collection of episodes. For those who don't know (and since you're reading this review, that's probably none of you), it's basically about a guy and two robots who make fun of bad movies.
The first episode on the set is easily the weakest. ""Attack of the Giant Leeches,"" executive produced by Roger Corman, is a rather dull low-budget horror flick. Though the leech monsters look pretty goofy, it's mostly slow paced, and a surprising number of the peanut gallery's riffs fall flat. On the lighter side, the short, ""Undersea Kingdom Chapter 1,"" is quite funny.
""The Gunslinger"" (directed by Corman) was one of the few Westerns on the show. It's about a woman whose husband has died, and then she becomes the sheriff. While also a lifeless movie, the riffing is hilarious in this episode (which was host Joel Hodgeson's second last).
""Teenagers from Outer Space"" is without a doubt the funniest in the box. Some startingly old teenage aliens come to earth, but one of them escapes and gets a girlfriend, all while being chased by one of his alien superiors. This movie has everything - bad acting, a strangely structured story, poor dialogue, and arguably the worst-looking giant monster ever to grace the silver screen. The jokes are excellent in this episode, and the host segments are amusing (and quite surreal).
Finally, ""Mr. B's Lost Shorts"" is a collection of some of the educational shorts that were tackled on the show. The best of them is ""Mr. B Natural,"" which is probably the ""Manos: Hands of Fate"" of MST3K shorts. Other shorts are ""Design for Living,"" ""Hired!,"" ""X Marks the Spot,"" ""Johnny at the Fair,"" and ""Are You Ready for Marriage."" Riffing is solid throughout (the only exception being ""Design for Living,"" which might have been funnier without commentary).
The DVD set presents the shows in their original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The movie scenes vary depending on the source material, but doing any sort of digital restoration on them would be to miss the point. The host segments don't look quite as bright and sharp as on other releases, but are perfectly acceptable. Once again, uncut versions of the movies are not included as extras (unlike the early MST3K DVDs).",1106697600,2,2264,4.8984375
2125099,4,B0002VET2M,"This 4-disc set includes four movies.  I will rate and review each movie separately.

""Attack Of The Giant Leeches"" (1959) - 5 stars
Set in the swamps of the deep South, the giant leeches are really men wearing wetsuits with suction cups. Playboy playmate Yvette Vickers (Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman) stars as the wife of an obese grocer who cheats on him. She and her boyfriend both end up in the underwater lair of the giant leeches, which Joel dubs the cave of Dr. Calamari.  At one point in the film, we see the scantily clad Yvette writhing in horror at the return of one of the monsters. Crow cracks, ""This must be the swimsuit edition of Leech Illustrated."" This low budget creature feature is high on the laugh scale and one of the best Joel episodes.

""Teenagers From Outer Space"" (1959) - 5 stars
Aliens, who look like their teenage years were spent in outer space, arrive on Earth. They find it a suitable feeding ground for their Gargon herd. The Gargons look a lot like lobsters, whose giant forms are only shown in shadow! However, when Derek discovers that the Earth contains intelligent life, he opposes the mission. His companion Thor has no such qualms, and uses his disintegrator ray gun to melt the flesh off his victims, leaving only a skeleton with a visible hook on its skull. This movie has so many lapses in logic that it inspires a ""Real To Reel"" host segment, in which Joel and the 'bots compare scenes in the film to the way events would have occurred in real life. This is a classic episode.

""Gunslinger"" (1956) - 3 stars
This no budget Western was directed by Roger Corman, and stars Beverly Garland as Rose Hood, who is married to the local sheriff.  When her husband is gunned down, Rose temporarily becomes the town Marshal.  John Ireland plays Cane Miro, a gunslinger hired by the female owner of the local saloon.  She wants him to kill Rose but, in meeting and talking to her, Cane and Rose fall in love.  One scene, in which they both sit in a tree, is especially funny.
Cane Miro: ""Look, you can see the Big Dipper.""
Joel: ""Hey, it's daytime.""
Crow: ""He's not talking about the stars!""
Unfortunately, the movie is so relentlessly boring that, even with their jokes and host segments, I can't give it five stars.

""Mr. B's Lost Shorts"" - 3 stars
Mr. B Natural is arguably the funniest short to ever appear on the show.  An androgynous woman plays Mr. B Natural, the Spirit of Music.  She appears to a young, shy boy and convinces him to take up the trumpet.  Soon, he is playing like a pro and is a big hit at parties.  The jokes about a woman appearing in a young boy's bedroom to help him master his instrument are hilarious.  I can't help but agree with Joel when he states, ""Mr. B, you're hot!""  The remaining shorts range from the mundane (Are You Ready For Marriage?, Johnny At The Fair) to the bizarre (X Marks The Spot, Design For Dreaming).  Including the short Hired, Part 1 makes no sense without also having Part 2.  Personally, I would have preferred a couple of the better shorts being paired with the other movies, and having a fourth movie on the fourth disc.

A total of 16 stars, divided by 4 movies, equals a rating of 4 stars for this box set.",1106265600,2,3201,4.450342465753424
2125100,5,B0002VET2M,"...shows up in your bedroom and tries to coerce you into joining the school band, all the while claiming that musical instruments are her family and that she knew Adam and Eve and your father.  What do you do?

Well, you can be happy that this is happening to gawky middle schooler Buzz instead of you as you watch Mr. B Natural, a vomit-inducing school film turned into comedy gold by our heroes at MST3K.

The 6th DVD box set breaks away from the Sci-Fi channel era and back to Comedy Central for three movies and a fourth collection of shorts.  The shorts include X Marks the Spot, in which a slain motorist is brought before the God of New Jersey who probably won't let him into New Jersey heaven because of his many sinful moving violations, and the mythical Hired Pt. 1 which is just what Manos fans have needed to learn why Jimmy the Salesman doesn't think that sales are an important part of his job.

It also features Teenagers from Outer Space, your usual 50's produced, teenagers-in-their-30's centered hokum about giant lobsters, a ""tohcha"" loving commander and a malicious alien empire ""We are the supreme race.  We have the supreme weapons.  We have the supreme pizzas"".  Gunslinger (which was already released on VHS) is classic Corman about an old west feud betweeen two rough and tumble women with anachronistic access to eyebrow pencils.  Finally, Attack of the Giant Leeches (or are they guys in black rain ponchos, no wait, they're definitely leeches) which features playful murderous bantering between a slovenly hillbilly and his nymphette wife, a main character who pretty much does nothing, and some semi-intelligent human livestock-raising leeches (as Joel hypothesizes: ""They're smart enough to enjoy eating at Chili's, but not smart enough to realize it's a chain).

Unforunately, there are no extras to speak of, but since it has long unseen episodes of the most original, inventive, and aggressively funny shows to ever hit the airwaves, it can all be forgiven.  Fans have no reason not to pick this up and newcomers owe it to themselves to see the cult show that never should have just been cult.  Now if you'll excuse me, I've got movie sign.",1102723200,11,2173,4.811827956989247
2125101,4,B0002VET2M,"Having unfortunately come across this show only through Rhino releases, I've had to wait patiently for new episodes.

This new set isn't disappointing but some of it isn't that special.

Mr. B's Lost Shorts - The ""Mr. B Natural"" short is more than enough to make this one of the best of all the DVDs released.  It even makes it okay that I now own Design For Dreaming for the 3rd time (VHS, MST3K: The Essentials, and Vol. 6).  That doesn't matter much since the near pornographic consumerism and downright absurd plot (schizophrenic housewife hallucinates herself to an autoshow accompanied by Michael Crawford and sells her soul for the fabulous Firebird II) make it funny each time you watch.  ""Hired: Part 1"" is surprisingly much less funny than Part 2.  ""X Marks the Spot"" also surprised me by getting funnier every time I've seen it (the first time I was bored out of my mind).  The kid in ""Johnny at the Fair"" actually must have been a good actor.  It's kind of creepy because you feel like you are watching an unattended kid wandering around the fair.  ""Are You Ready for Marriage?"" is funny but doesn't top the similar ""Is This Love?"".

Attack of the Giant Leeches - BORING BORING BORING.  I used to think Hamlet was the most boring episode I've seen but this beats it hands down.  This movie makes the Coleman Francis films look action packed.  There is no way that Joel, Crow, and Tom could have made this movie funny.  None of the characters have any personality at all, not even enough to mock.  People just stand around wondering whether they should dynamite the bodies out of the swamp.  The only characters with any potential to make fun of is the chunky redneck and his strumpet wife.  The rest are painfully dull, and not even in a ""Skydivers"" sort of way.  The short for this ep (Undersea Kingdom) is just...bizarre.  It starts out with a bunch of sweaty forties-beefcake sailors grunting and wrestling and getting physical examinations.  Then somehow a rocket sub, a guy who dies ala Star Trek redshirts, and horsemen who forgot to stop at the gas stop to ask for directions get involved.  How Indiana Jones, Star Wars, or Sky Captain were inspired by this is anyone's guess.

Gunslinger - Like ""Leeches"" this is a Roger Corman film but is much more enjoyable.  This is an episode that seemed mediocre at first but gets better each time you see it.  The whole movie I rooted for the red-headed madam and her bartender flunkie.  They're much more likable than the blonde buttkicking sheriff and the outlaw she falls in love with.  Some of the best heckling is done during the opening credits and while the sheriff and outlaw shoot each other to death/declare their love.

The only thing is that I wish an episode I hadn't seen yet had been included in this slot.  However, I don't think this episode is available on DVD any other way, only on the probably discontinued VHS releases.

Teenagers From Outer Space - I'd say this is the best of the bunch.  If Mr. B Natural's greatness wasn't diluted by the other shorts it would have been more of a tie.  I've seen this film in it's original version and it is hilarious even without sarcastic commentary.  Many of the jokes made by Joel and the crew are almost the same as what I had thought of.  There's the ""Rock Lobster"" reference, TOR-CHA, ""Terminator 2"" references, etc.  And I knew they'd make their ubiquitous ""Harry Connick Jr!"" remark.  Still, they came up with quite a bit of brilliant, unexpected stuff.

If you're an MST3K fan there is no question that you'll get this set.  Even though one episode was lackluster, and one has been released previously, it's still a great opportunity to get some new MST3K.",1101168000,13,3684,4.62962962962963

""Attack of the Giant Leeches"", ""Mr. B's Lost Shorts"", ""Gunslinger"" and ""Teenagers from Outer Space"" are all great to see again, and it's fantastic that Rhino is putting out ""new"" episodes on dvd, that is, episodes like ""Leeches"" and ""Teenagers from Outer Space"" that have not been released on dvd previously. I like too that we are getting more stuff from the Comedy Central years as my tapes are now 10 years old and wearing out! I know some folks prefer Joel to Mike, and some prefer Mike over Joel....I don't have a preference...this show is just funny and well worth your time and money. If you aren't familiar with MST3K then this is as good a place to start as any. The only drawback to this box set is the lack of extras. I know on earlier releases Rhino often included the Un-Mstied version of movies, they have also included original trailers before, and on the last box set, Mike actually introduced the individual films. Volume 6 has nothing extra. Still, the box set is great, and hopefully Rhino will keep pumping these things out.",1099440000,,1161,4.613526570048309

2125105,5,B0002VET2M,"...with yet another welcome release of a ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" Collection.  This time the episodes are from Season 4 - these haven't been broadcast in almost a decade, and most fans will want these.  Some comments about the episodes:

""Teenagers From Outer Space""  - There's nothing like watching a movie about sullen, snotty teenagers.  This movie's got 'em, and they're dressed in ridiculous spacesuit-type outfits, too.  Our hero Teenage Alien, ""Derek"", is a fugitive from his peers who wield deadly ray guns that turn people into cheap plastic skeletons after an awkward jump cut.  (At least I think that's what the director wanted us to think...)

""Attack of the Giant Leeches""  - Lots of things to recommend about this one.  It starts with a classic 'Undersea Kingdom' serial as the short.  Hilarious by itself, Joel and the 'Bots savage this very bad example of late 1930s pulp cinema.  As far as the feature goes...thing of it as a hate letter to the South.  It involves a giant leech infestation of a Southern swamp, and some sort of love triangle.  It doesn't make a lot of sense, actually....but then again we're not here for the feature.

""Gunslinger"".  Roger Corman.  Beverly Garland.  Actually, it's not that bad a movie, but something about the pairing of Corman and Garland make for an excellent MST3K flick.  Someone once wrote that this dreary western was 'turgid, uninspired, cliched, confusing, and artistically bereft of merit'.....but those are the GOOD points of this classic Corman flick.  This disc justifies the entire price of the collection, and it's great to see this on DVD.

""Mr. B's Lost Shorts""  Fortunately, this shorts collection pretty much is the last of the shorts shown during the last half of the MST3K broadcast run.  The gem here is ""Mr. B. Natural"", a disturbing short in which an androgynous elf convinces a young boy of the power of music.  Jerry Falwell will have a fit when he sees this young boy corrupted by the perky Mary Martin/Richard Simmons/Peter Pan being.  One of the greats.

All in all, Rhino seems to have gotten the message about which episodes the fans seem to want most.  There is a small but vocal cult for this show and it looks like it will continue to grow with a decent collection of episodes.",1096243200,85,2269,4.810880829015544
2125106,5,B0002VET2M,"This release from Rhino Video goes back to the ""classic"" Comedy Central years and some of the best MST3K. Episodes include:

Teenagers From Outer Space: One of the funniest episodes ever, it's a 1959 low-budget b/w science fiction movie about an alien invasion from a planet with a totalitarian regime and the struggle of one sensitive alien teenager to escape and live free as an individual here on Earth. An evil and sadistic alien teenager charged with bringing him back to their spaceship dead or alive hunts him through the picture, while the teenage hero finds love and friendship in small town America. Filled with ray guns, flying saucers, alien monsters that look suspiciously like lobsters, jump suit ""space suits"" and more low-budget fun, Joel and the `Bots have an easy time milking this one for continuous laughs throughout.

Attack of the Giant Leeches: Another b/w low-budget 1959 picture, this one is ""sci-fi/horror"" about some really over-sized leeches capturing rural townsfolk and keeping them around as food stock in their underwater cave. The subplot leading into all the leech-infested fun involves a devoted if unexciting husband (Bruno Ve Sota) trying in vain to keep his young wife (Yvette Vickers) happy. Seems she is steamier than the swamp and looking for someone to cheat and run away with about every 10 seconds. Anyway, there is lots of drama and cheesy horror for the MST3K crew to hurl jokes at, making this one a lot of fun.

Gunslinger: This Roger Corman ""classic"" stars John Ireland and Beverly Garland. Garland is the strong-willed widow of the last sheriff and she is determined to clean up the town, while Ireland is the hired gun sent to kill her who ends up falling for her charms. The good cast make this a better than average Corman picture, and the western setting gives the MST3K crew a nice change of genre on which to launch their humor.

Mr. B's Lost Shorts??!!: The shorts on this disc, previously available on VHS directly from Best Brains, are not to be missed! They are all winners, and the first one in the collection, Mr. B Natural, is legendary among MST3K fans as one of the funniest things ever done on the show. You simply have to see it to believe it and if you've seen it before then you know how much fun this one is to watch again and again. Other shorts include the hilarious, ""X Marks The Spot"", ""Hired!-Part 1"", ""Design for Dreaming"" , ""Johnny At The Fair"" and ""Are You Ready for Marriage? "". These all amply demonstrate the terrific wit of the writers and performers of MST3K as well as anything they ever did. This is truly top-notch material. The only sad thing about having the shorts separated from the episodes in which they originally appeared is that one doesn't then get to see the hilarious host segments based on those same shorts, which followed them in the full episode. For example, Mr. B Natural was followed by a host segment in which the `Bots debate whether Mr. B is a man or a woman; it was an INCREDIBLY FUNNY and terrific follow-up to some of the best humor ever done on MST3K, making the experience even funnier. Nevertheless, don't let that stop you from enjoying this collection because you definitely will.

With three episodes from the Joel/Comedy Central era and a disc full of ""shorts"", this set will keep you occupied for so long, what with repeated viewings and all.

""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" is first on the list, and, well, hardly any attacking ever occurs. Joel and the bots have a good time with this film, although it's not really their best work in the 4th season. 7.5/10

""Gunslinger"", one of Joel's last episodes, is a pretty slow-paced Roger Corman western that adds good fodder for the trio to riff at. It stands on the same level of the Giant Leeches film, though. 7.5/10

""Mr. B.'s Lost Shorts"" happens to be a great compilation of selected shorts from certain episodes. They're all gems here, but the best is undoubtedly ""Mr. B. Natural"". As dull and retarded as an educational short can get, lost of hilarious riffs occur with this one, such ""Joel, I'm scared."", or ""Hey, leave my father out of this!"" Seriously, this is really funny stuff. 9/10

This set goes off with a bang as ""Teenagers From Outer Space"", from the start adds great riffs from the trio. One of the best host segments occurs with the hosts explaining through illustration what happens in movies and in real life. 9/10

2125142,4,B0002VET2M,"Overall I'm really happy with this collection because of the inclusion of Teenagers From Outer Space and the Lost Shorts disc, but I would not have chosen to include Gunslingers, one of my least favorite episodes, and while Attack Of The Giant Leeches isn't bad it's not all that great either.

Teenagers From Outer Space is a new favorite of mine since getting this collection. Aside from being a hilarious episode it's suprisingly watchable as a movie, with a fast pace and a story that actually mostly makes sense, as well as some real emotion too. Of course it's cheesy in the way that all fifties space operas were, with goofy ""space"" suits, rayguns and a forced-perspective lobster for a monster. Seriously, it's a dead lobster. Not even a puppet. Just a lobster. ""The high council will sentence you to TORCHA!!""

Mr. B's Lost Shorts is another gem, with the hilarious and wacky Mr. B Natural leading the way, followed by some old and grainy educational films about driving safety and marriage and a crazy acid-trip of a car commercial from the fifties.

Gunslinger is a poorly-made western which would be unbearable without Joel and the Bots to riff on it, and even with the jokes it's slow and agonizing. It's my second least favorite episode next to Catalina Caper and I wish something like Night Of The Bloodbeast had been included instead.

Attack Of The Giant Leeches is okay, but not a great episode in my opinion. It's drab and boring and the riffing does a lot to liven it up but not enough. The leeches themselves look like guys wearing garbage bags and silly string, so that's funny. But the episode in general disappoints.

On the other hand, in its defense, the plot is more interesting than most bad sci-fi movies.  An alien race is trying to find a planet to grow their herds of meat-animals on.  Which makes the plot better than them just showing up one day and blasting with their silly ray guns.  And, yes, there is blasting.  And God are the ray guns silly looking.
Attack of the Giant Leeches (along with the first episode of Undersea Kingdom) is really bad but at least the leeches don't look TOO much like people in suits.  And the host segments are funny.  Holo-Clowns!
Mr B's Lost Shorts are a series of shorts, some of which are alreay out on tape, some which are not - all are funny.

ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES: This episode starts off with a short serial called ""Undersea Kingdom"", which is predictably goofy (the plot involves the discovery of the lost continent of Atlantis by the crew of a rocket-powered submarine) and the mocking is well up to par.  The opening credits of the main feature will you everything you need to know about it.  First of all is the title, ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"".  Does anything scream stereotypically bad 1950's science fiction movie more than that?  The other thing the credits reveal is the name of the producer: Roger Corman.  Help.

A lot of the jokes come at the expense of the clich&eacute;d small-town hillbilly characters and also the well-meaning environmental protector who's overly cautious attitude ends up providing the monsters with a hell of a lot of food.  And, of course, we have the requisite bad monster costumes, which are exactly as inept as the image that pops into your head when you hear the title of this movie.  There's a really goofy love-triangle that provides much laughter.  This is the type of episode where you laugh at the movie as hard as you laugh at the commentary.

GUNSLINGER: After a marshal in the old west is gunned down by a generic bad guy, his plucky widow decides to take matters into her own hands.  She becomes the sheriff until a replacement can be found, and tries to maintain order in the town while seeking revenge for her murdered husband.  I actually like the sound of that.  Unfortunately, there's a problem.  This is another Roger Corman film.

Camera shots aren't lined up properly.  Actors stand in the background not knowing they're in the shot.  Poor editing means that characters leap from inside to outside in the blink of an eye.  This last flaw makes for one of the funniest host segments I've seen, where Tom Servo teleports himself all over the Satellite of Love to the amazement of his fellow crew.  This quite a fun episode; the commentary is sharp and the movie is hilarious.

MR. B'S LOST SHORTS: A collection of shorts rather than a full-fledged episode.  The show did a number of short films; usually educational films shown in classrooms to captive audiences.  I've been a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan for a number of years now, but I'd never seen the ""Mr. B. Natural"" short which has a fearsome reputation in fan circles.  Now I finally understand that reputation.  There have been a lot of strange films and shorts shown on MST3k, but clearly this ranks up there with the oddest.  A hyperactive, dancing, androgynous woman (Mr. B Natural) wearing blue tights and a suit covered in musical notes pops into the lives of troubled young men and attempts interesting them in music.  The comments from the crew reflect the feelings of everyone who watches this film: utter bafflement and horror.

Also in this collection are MARKS THE SPOT (the highest traffic court in New Jersey is actually a lower court in heaven, where God's judges and lawyers deal out harsh justice to habitual bad drivers), HIRED! (""Well, that's something you didn't hear much of during the Bush administration.""), DESIGN FOR DREAMING (a General Motors promotional film where a woman dreams about all the great things GM will be providing in the future), JOHNNY AT THE FAIR (a little munchkin runs away from his parents at a fair and becomes a proto-Forrest Gump, meeting bemused celebrities of the day), and ARE YOU READY FOR MARRIAGE? (according to this film, the answer is no).  I love these little bite-sized morsels of MST3k.  They're great when you need a small portion of hilarity, but when you're not sure you could survive another two hours of MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE.

TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE: An alien named Derek (yes, really) runs away from his fellow aliens.  He tries to disguise himself as a teenage human, which ordinarily would be difficult given that he looks about 30.  Fortunately for him, he's landed in a 1950's science fiction movie where all the regular teenage humans look about 30.  He meets an impossibly gullible family who let him live with them and naturally he learns what it is we humans call ""love"".  Oh, and there some giant special effect lobsters wandering around.  I actually sort of liked this movie in a strange way.  But the jokes are really sharp.  Definitely a winner.

Overall, this is a great collection.  I've been buying these MST3k box sets as they're released and I've been quite happy with them.  If you're a fan, you simply have to pick these up.  If you're not, then this is actually a great one to start with as the short films are easy to get into, and the long features are entertaining without being too painful.",1116633600,12,4875,4.726303317535545
2125146,5,B0002VET2M,"I really liked this set very much because it has one of my top ten favs, Teenager from Outer Space or as Joel and the 'bots like to call it 'Very old teenager from outerspace'.  Mr B's Lost Shorts was a nice addition for one reason and that was Mr. B Natural which was the story of a very gender confused peter pan charcter and an equally confused 13 year-old.  I also like Attack of the Gaint Leeches and the skit with the Danger to Ourselves and Others song.  I forgot how that can stick in your head.  This is a good set for all those MSTies who missed out on some of the Joel eps.  I wish they would bring out some other classics like Outlaw, City Limits, Final Sacrifice and Soultakers.",1114905600,2,691,4.165413533834586
8032868,5,B0002VET2M,"Want an evening of laugh?  'Teenagers From Outer Space' is funny even for MST3000.  I've seen the original version, but the extra humor provided by the robots doubles the value of this one.",1473638400,,189,4.696969696969697

Nonetheless, these are classic Joel episodes and all of them are very funny.",1375660800,,271,4.787234042553192
8032872,2,B0002VET2M,"I have most of the MST3K DVD Box Sets and this is not one of my favorites.

The three movies are completely forgettable and I haven't watched any of them twice.

The Shorts DVD is excellent and we watch that DVD often.

One out of four isn't great when you're paying a lot of money.",1372809600,,282,4.090909090909091
8032873,5,B0002VET2M,Teenagers is one of our favorites but all 4 of the disc are very good! MST3K at their best time.,1353974400,,96,3.85
8032874,4,B0002VET2M,"Episode 406: Attack of the Giant Leeches with short Undersea Kingdom Part 1
Some guy catches his wife in the act and forces the wife and her lover into a swamp, then some leeches attack, no one believes him though some game warden guy goes on the search for these monsters. There's not much too it but there's bad acting, bad writing oh and like the title says giant leeches. The guys do a great job with this one and especially with the short as they are sharp as ever with the riffs. Favorite Line: ""Thanks for comforting me with a gun""

Episode 511: Gunslinger
After a man is murdered in a western town his wife (Beverly Garland, from Episode 503 Swamp Diamonds) takes over. There's lots of gunplay, fights, saloon dancing and of course horse riding among the very cheap sets, which you should expect from a Roger Corman movie. While not the best episode its certainly a good effort by them. Favorite Line: ""The Pony Express: When it absolutely, positively has to be there... in 3 or 4 months or so.""

Episode 404: Teenagers From Outer Space
A few guys land that look more like 30 somethings than teenagers and a couple of em go to release a creature that will grow in our atmosphere and help enslaved Earth. One of these aliens of course is against this plan, escapes and falls for a woman that takes him into her home, there's also her grandpa who appeared in The Sinister Urge in the sixth season, who provides his own comic relief. The movie is pretty bad, especially the monster thats just a lobster, and the acting and dialogue are very laughable. Its a great showing for the crew though as they just slam everything and everyone. Favorite Line: ""Hello, Uhura!!""

Mr. B's Lost Shorts

-Mr. B. Natural: A young boy named Buzz dreams of being able to play a musical instrument, enter Mr. B. Natural straight out of psych ward and so peppy you just want to scream in terror and run. Its hilarious throughout and boy do Joel and the bots have fun with this one. Favorite Line: ""Well excuse me, sexless man/woman""

-X Marks The Spot: What happens when you have a fatal auto accident? Well for the guy in this short he goes to afterlife traffic court and a judge determines whether he'll end up in heaven or hell. This one is pretty long but funny in parts. Favorite Line: ""If you kill yourself here, we can't kill them over there""

-Hired!: The head of a car dealership hires a new guy who just can't sell a car, no matter how hard he tries to teach him. Its a good and funny one. Favorite Line: ""My failure looks more and more imminent""

-Design For Dreaming: The technological wonders of the future are on display as a woman dances and is carried around by some guy in suit and a mask. Its beyond creepy and weird and Mike and the bots riff away and are often hilarious. Favorite Lin: ""Look, dead racoon of tomorrow""

-Johnny At The Fair: A boy gets lost at the Canadian National Expedition when he parents basically let him wander off. Along the way he meets boxer Joe Louis and other people. Its a very funny short from the guys. Favorite Line: ""Johnny feels dark hands pressing him onward, the voices in his head get meaner.""

-Are You Ready For Marriage?: There's a young couple who wants to get married and they consult a guy whose an expert in marriages. Its very cheesy but very funny from the crew. Favorite Line: The whole part with the rubber band was hilarious.

This is a good set to buy, its nice that the 3 episodes are all Joel ones and the shorts a very funny too.",1311465600,,3486,4.41588785046729
8032875,3,B0002VET2M,"I've got quite a collection of MST3k discs now and I must say this collection as a whole isn't one of my favs. Teenagers is a decent watch and there are some memorable moments during the shorts, although there is also some overlap in play here.

It may be safe to say that fans of Joel may appreciate this more than fans of Mike as I believe Mike only makes a limited appearance during a few shorts.  That said, I don't think these are Joel's strongest episodes and if you're looking to get into MST3K, you may want to put this volume down on your list a bit.",1307836800,,559,4.166666666666667
8032876,5,B0002VET2M,Product is great... it has Gunslinger which is one of the best MST3K's ever! Teenagers from Outer Space is great also and the other two don't disappoint as usual.,1304899200,,162,4.620689655172414
8032877,4,B0002VET2M,"This is a very decent volume -- basically one painful episode, one decent ep, and two must-have discs.

Attack of the Giant Leeches is almost unbearable.  Just a warning: after the first third of the movie you start to hate your life.  Even with all the wonderful wisecracks and hilarious host segments, it's hard not to turn the thing off.  It's just that you want everyone to die and they don't.  I will admit that nothing is funnier than some monster that looks like an evil zucchini in a trash bag, but it cannot save this episode.

Gunslinger is decent.  This is a sub-substandard Western all about Beverly Garland's adventures as lady Sheriff (mostly shooting at random people trying to enter her town).  The best element is definitely the horrible can-can dancers.  ""Get off my ravioli!"" has become a catchphrase around the house thanks to this one.  Unfortunately, the movie slows down midway through.  It's a drag until the last act, when the movie literally commits suicide!

Teenagers from Outer Space!  What a malodorous delight!  The wisecracks only emphasize the hilarity of this film; I love it when Tom speaks for the birds in the first act and adore the host segment ""Reel to Real.""  As for the movie, it's awesome.  Nothing is more threatening than lobsters, right?  Okay, what about levitating shadow space lobsters?  You're right.  It's horrifying.  You'll cry.  Oh, and what does this have to do with teenagers?  Not much.  There are two.  One is a psychopath and one just wants love.  The first one wants everyone to die and rushes about shooting a death ray with his teeth gritted in a permanent evil grin; the second hangs out with Anne Frank and never uses contractions.  At the end of the movie there's some kind of climax involving this space lobster's family eating Earth.  This is bad, obviously, and must be stopped.  Watch it so you'll know what to do in case of an alien invasion.

Mr. B's Lost Shorts.  Oh, what a wonderful collection.  Nearly all of the shorts are side-splitting joyrides.  I take this one to parties to introduce people to the wonders of MST3k; everyone laughs their lungs out without fail.  ""Design for Dreaming,"" ""Johnny at the Fair,"" and ""Are You Ready for Marriage?"" are all great.  ""X Marks the Spot"" and ""Hired! Part One"" are the only lackluster ones.

Mr. B Natural stands out.  It never fails to please; nor does it fail to creep you out. There's a reason this is the most famous MST3k short. When I first saw this I thought there had to be some kind of mistake about B Natural's gender.  When she... uh, he... sneaks into kids' bedrooms to teach them about music... well.  I think it goes without saying.  The constant cries of horror from the guys really make this short for me.  It's the icing on the cake, topping off a wonderful collection of shorts that has few low points.

This is a pretty decent collection overall, and definitely worth the money.  Grab this one while you still can!",1221696000,,2952,4.663424124513619
