I came on to this page to purchase one to return the favour, but there is no useful information on this item at the time of this review, not even from Amazon's editors.

This is a Canadian production, assited by the Chinese where scenes were shot in China.  The scenery is glorious.  Canadian autumn.  Where did they find that antique train.  The scenes of a marketplace in 19th Century China were colourful and I am glad I could upscale the dvd.  Colour saturation was intense.  Cinematography was great.  Period costumes were impeccable.

Sam Neill is charged with building a railroad within a stipulated time, or the bank will foreclose everything he owns.  He sends his layabout son to China to recruit 2000 Chinese coolies from Peter O'Toole to build the railroad.  Tony Leung Kar Wai is the big star on the Chinese side.  Explosives, murder, betrayal, kung fu, naked butts, fraud, brutal exploitation of workers, accidental and intentional deaths, strikes, wandering spirits, are some ingredients of this made for TV movie (I think it is).

This movie looks like a Merchant Ivory production.  A production like this lends itself well to Blu-ray presentation.  It would take Blu-ray to capture all the beautiful detail in this movie.  All we need now is a decently priced Blu-ray.",1255910400,3,1398,4.851694915254237
