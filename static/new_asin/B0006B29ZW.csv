Now the critique.  The amount of money that was spent on this project must be have been extravagant.  If that was case, a little more care should have been added to the video editing.  At times, I felt like I was watching something akin to the ""Blair Witch Project"" with all that cutting, poor focusing, and imagery not in sync with the song.  This may sound a little harsh, but luckily, having seen Israel and New Breed in concert recently...I know better.

Hopefully, his next venture in DVD land will equal his hard work and musical talent.  This one fell short.",1107475200,3,809,4.6879432624113475
2181266,5,B0006B29ZW,"This DVD is definitely worth buying for anyone! I mean musicians will blown away by the musicianship and Aaron Lindsay's arrangements. Vocalists will love Isreal's vocal ability and Daniel's range. Overall the worship is awesome and anointed.

  I love how Isreal is humble and sensitive to the Holy Spirit even in this DVD. He is also sensitive to the individual talents and their personal anointing. He even shares the lead vocal spot with Aaron Lindsay, Michael Gunger, Daniel Johnson (who's vocal solo will leave you breathless) and even Martha Munizzi makes a guest appearance. They BGV's are energetic and their harmonies are right on.

  The musicianship alone will blow you away. Minstrel's Advance will keep you repeating the song over and over. TP's bass playing is smooth, Aaron is killing it on the keys, and Chris Coleman will make drummers cry with his drum solos...that's right I said drum solos which are all over the DVD. He's like a machine gun, you just have to see it to believe it.

  The only dissapointment as said in earlier reviews is the way it was shot. If you watch it on a big screen you may get motion sickness from the first song, but after that it calms down a bit. Also whoever edited this DVD needs to be fired. The vocals in some spots are delayed and the musician chops are also delayed in spots. But I can overlook this seeing as how much more the positive outways the negative. Buy this DVD, it is so worth it!",1104796800,4,1448,4.603112840466926
2181267,4,B0006B29ZW,"If you know Israel & his stellar band, New Breed, you'd know that anything these guys release is guaranteed to be of the highest quality, musically, creatively, an inspiration to the rest of us. Their efforts on this DVD release are no exception, however, the visual experience is let down (at times, very, very badly) by sloppy editing. The playing and singing you see is sometimes painfully out of sync with what you hear.

Having said that, however, the music is spectacular. If you've heard the CD, be prepared to hear even more over the top arrangements carried off in superb style. There is so much more on the DVD - instrumentals, solos, medleys that mix it up without being at all jarring in the transitions. Rather, these inspired changes do indeed take it to another level.

These guys, Israel particularly, are some of the most talented and soulful musicians you're ever likely to hear. Hopefully they release another DVD where the visual element comes up to par.",1102896000,7,974,4.791666666666667
2181268,5,B0006B29ZW,"A True Worship Experience. My goodness if your a musician and you don't have this dvd, hurry up theres still time. Im probably watching it right now. The band is out of this world, that is the best gospel dvd out there. His drummer is off the hook!!!!! Israel and Newbreed is the truth when it comes to gospel music. Go get it cause you are missing out. Trust me!!!!!!",1101254400,2,368,4.271428571428571
2181269,5,B0006B29ZW,"Well If you like the CD, then you'll love the DVD because you're not hearing the CD music over the footage, its all raw sounds that you didn't hear on the CD. I've been waiting for this DVD for so long that I decided to just buy it at my local christian bookstore rather than waiting. At first I wasn't too happy about the way the whole thing was shot... too much camera movement... I wish they would focus the camera on the musicians for a bit =D (so i can learn something!) but what makes up for all this is seeing that the order of the songs are mixed up and you'll hear different versions of the songs you heard from the CD. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY PLAYED ALL THIS LIVE!! ITS SOUNDS SO AMAZING! But then again, they're all pros... You're in for a treat if you get this DVD. And I recommend this to all musicians! (Time to go copy some of the keyboardists on my keys! =D )",1101254400,6,872,4.075581395348837
2181270,5,B0006B29ZW,"This is one of the best products that I have ever purchased. In fact, I have ordered 2 more of these to give out to other people. I would order more in the future. It is fabulous.",1207353600,,179,3.864864864864865
2181271,5,B0006B29ZW,"Israel Houghton and New Breed is my favorite band.  About 80% of the music that my church, Church in the Now in Conyers, GA, plays is from them.  I love everything they have out and this is an awesome dvd!!!  I put it on early every morning and then I get on my treadmill and do between 5- over 6 miles!  Their music keeps me charged and it enables me to finish my workout.  I also like their African dvd.  Both are great dancing music too!!",1188000000,,441,4.069767441860465
2181272,4,B0006B29ZW,"This DVD gives you what you need to mooooooooooove!!!!

Incredible performance, beautiful songs and nice sound and picture quality!!!

I also have the ""Live from Another Level"" CD and just so you know, it's a different recording!!

So even if you have the CD, I suggest to get the DVD as well.

Songs are slightly different played, but it is worth buying it!!

The only thing they could have done better is the syncronisation between sound and picture...",1170288000,,454,4.769230769230769
2181273,5,B0006B29ZW,"This is one of the best concerts I have heard, musicians are going to love this dvd, the music is so well arranged, Terrence Palmer on bass is awesome and really anointed, Israel is so anointed, and all his songs are really great. The cameraman on the dvd wasn't all that good, but the music is really awesome, from beginning to end. I love this dvd, I recommended to all who like Gospel or praise and worship, and I recommended to all musicians.",1125360000,4,446,4.385542168674699
2181274,3,B0006B29ZW,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge, HUGE fan of Israel Houghton and the New Breed.  First of all their music is biblical and God honoring and secondly, they bring something to the worship music table that is sorely lacking these days, real musical talent.  Having said that, I was pretty happy with this DVD (only because I'm such a big fan) but it left me wanting more.  Previous reviewers have already covered the sub par production of the DVD so I won't go there but I will say that this DVD doesn't do a good job of showing the obvious musical talent of this group.  There are a lot of crowd shots and entire band shots but it would have been nice to see more musician shots.  As it is you don't really get to see how ridiculously talented this band is through this DVD.  I'm a musician myself and a big reason why I buy music DVDs is to see how exactly the musicians make the music they do and therefore have my appreciation of the music and the musicians enhanced.  This DVD didn't do such a good job of that.",1123286400,3,1019,4.194871794871795
2181275,1,B0006B29ZW,"First off - don't get me wrong, I LOVE Israel and own his two cds which are awesome but I ordered this dvd and it's so disappointing! I don't understand who filmed this concert but all video cameras are so BAD - it's shaking round and round, terrible details and the whole scene is messed up. So I recommend just to listen to his cds but it's not worthy to watch, trust me :o(",1116720000,4,376,4.094594594594595
2181276,3,B0006B29ZW,"The worship is definitely an experience that is one of a kind.  If you have the CD, you know that the worship is just awesome.  However, I was very disappointed at the way in which the DVD was done.  I brought it for my sister as a Christmas gift, and I was a little embarrased.  The editing was horrible.  I felt like I was watching an old foreign movie that was being translated.  There were times where I literally had to just close my eyes and listen, because it was so distracting to watch.  I pray that then next DVD/VHS project he does is of much better quality.  I don't really watch the DVD anymore, I just listen to the CD.",1115164800,2,633,4.1735537190082646
