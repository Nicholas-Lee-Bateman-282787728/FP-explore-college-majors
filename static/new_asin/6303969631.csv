752168,5,6303969631,"If you are a fan of the film "" The Name of the Rose"", you will love Brother Cadfael

The monk is part Father Brown with Sherlock Holmes. He solves crimes the medievel way and the way he does it will intrigue mystery lovers everywhere.

Derek Jacobi bring an aire of class to Cadfael. He brings the character off the page of the Peter's novels with ease

I recieved this as a very early Christmas gift from a friend going to Europe for a few months, thanks Dan for the gift..it is a great addition to my DVD Mystery library and it will fit in any of yours.

Also all disks have Jacobi audio commaries on all three shows in this collection..worth it for that alone

752169,5,6303969631,"This is one of the best sets in the series. Although I think Sean Pertwee in the first set was a better sheriff, this group of stories is incredible. We see consoling, love, intrigue, lechery, murder, highway bandits, rape, kidnapping, and a host of other acts of love and violence. Some true chivalry, an evil monk but not the one that is accused, and mysterious disappearances of people make this set great to watch. The set contains many sub stories in each story that makes them all the more interesting. We find out a piece of the puzzle in Cadfael's love life while he was on the Crusades. The set does not contain much as far as extra's but the series alone is well worth the price. The quality is comparable with the rest in the series and quite adequate.",1078099200,12,763,4.457142857142857
752170,3,6303969631,"This set has gone a bit downhill from the first series.  These are still enjoyable, but not nearly as close to the world of the books.  The first big problem is the very unfortunate decision to merge the characters of the two sheriffs.  The actor in the first series was a great Hugh Berringer and this one is a great Sheriff Prestcote, but the two were such totally different personalities that their lines can't be combined into a coherent role.  Which raises the question, why weren't the books done in the order they were written so that the two characters could be handled properly?  Secondly, Cadfael loves the world and its creatures, but has a certain detachment, befitting a monk, viewing worldly folly more with sorrow and compassion than anger.  He seems here to be sliding more towards the Last Angry Man with a contempt for the fools around him.  He isn't set so far apart from the rest of the cast in the books.  The quality of costuming varies wildly, with some of the women looking more like attendees at a late 20th century prom than medieval women.  Some of the other supporting characters, notably Brother Jerome and Prior Roberts and the two abbotts are great!",1063584000,6,1180,4.661835748792271
752171,4,6303969631,"... Brother Cadfael is *still* the most unique, complex, fascinating detective out there. Add to that the endlessly treacherous and intriguing setting, and you've found a winner.
The production standard is incredible; visually, it's an impressive effort and very realistic. It manages to be grand and gritty at once.
The acting is likewise superb. I could never have pictured a better Cadfael than the sterling Sir Derek Jacobi.
The only reason I gave this set four stars rather than five is that this particular Cadfael series is not my favorite of the four. All of them are worth owning, however.",1045526400,12,598,4.99

7858366,3,6303969631,Watching Jacobi is a joy on any medium.  These often do not follow the novels very well but you can only do so much in a 90 minute segment.,1520208000,,139,3.793103448275862
7858367,5,6303969631,"I have written individual reviews of each film. This is a review of the Box Set. Naturally it is less expensive to purchase a set. The box case helps keep all the Cadfaels in one location. It also looks better organized. The actual material is cardboard. There is a written summary of the set contents on the back of the box. Bottom line box sets look nicer if you are collecting.

7858370,5,6303969631,"One of my favorite detectives! Brother Cadfael uses crude but effective forensic clues to solve murder mysteries, sometimes even running afoul of his own elders in the abbey. These are the first of Cadfael's episodes that I ever saw, and other than some poor lighting, I enjoyed each one thoroughly. I think I have every episode, I wish that more had been filmed.",1397088000,,363,4.777777777777778
7858371,2,6303969631,"I have read all of the Cafael stories multiple time and was interested when they made them PBS' ""Mystery"".  The first series was wonderful thanks to Derek Jacobi's Cadfael and his opponent/helper Hugh Beringar (Sean Pertwee, son of John Pertwee of Dr. Who fame).  Jacobi is the perfect Brother Cadfael- a stumpy legged former sailor with a rolling nautical gait and Sean Pertwee ""is"" Hugh Beringar- his looks are perfect- he is dark ,intense and aware, with a light, wiry build, and his acting is perfect for this role.  I enjoyed the first series, and so purchased the second.  Much to my horror they had traded intelligent, moderate Hugh with one of his sergeants- a tall dirty man with a long beard which looks like it has never been combed and who now has an adversarial relationship with Cadfael.  This series is not the same series as the books.  Instead of a friend with whom Cadfael sometimes has a conflict in their viewpoints he has a sheriff's deputy who can barely speak clearly and is clearly a low class man.  He is always suspicious of Cadfael's motives and half the time is trying to use Cadfael to set up a trap.  If they went back to Sean Pertwee as the sheriff I would be willing to look at them again, but trading someone who perfectly fits an urbane but military man for a big greasy thug you cannot have the same tale and Cadfael's relationship with Beringar is a large part of the depth and charm of the characters in the books.",1388188800,,1451,4.511450381679389
7858372,5,6303969631,"Medieval murder mystery, perhaps, but I still maintain that Brother Cadfael is wholesome entertainment.  So often these days, the Church is portrayed as hopelessly corrupt, spiritually empty, and an institution of oppression, and those who devote their lives to it as hypocrites, lascivious, prideful, and perpetrators of the worst of sins.  While there are serious sins among the monks and priests with whom Cadfael interacts, there is also deep compassion and real faith.  Moreover, the Church is portrayed (accurately, I think) as an institution in which imperfect people strive to be redeemed and, at times, are.  I have been thoroughly enjoying the Brother Cadfael mysteries and would recommend them to those who are disillusioned with the cynicism of contemporary culture toward Christianity.",1359158400,2,798,5.516393442622951
7858373,5,6303969631,This series of programs is a breath of fresh air.  A monk who is a detective.  Very unusual and novel idea.,1316822400,,107,4.0476190476190474
7858374,5,6303969631,"As a long-time Brother Cadfael fan, I appreciate the excellent character acting, depth of detail and historic settings
for this series and always find something I had missed in earlier viewings. Wish they would re-run it on PBS so I could
get friends and family to watch.",1301270400,,271,4.787234042553192
7858375,4,6303969631,"The Brother Cadfael mysteries take place during a massive civil war in the twelfth century between King Stephen and the Empress Maud. And politics is a driving force in ""Brother Cadfael, Set 2 (The Virgin in the Ice, The Devil's Novice, St. Peter's Fair)"" -- if it's not a civil war causing trouble for Cadfael, it's a gang of crusaders gone bad.

In ""The Virgin in the Ice,"" the monks find poor Brother Oswin almost beaten to dead and half-frozen in the snow... and Sister Hilaria, the nun he was traveling with, has been raped, murdered and frozen in the river. Of course, Oswin is the primary suspect, and it turns out the murder is involved with a a pair of young teenagers who have fallen into the gangs of a roving band of cruel bandits.

In ""The Devil's Novice,"" young Meriet Ashby is brought to Shrewsbury to become a monk. Cadfael is worried about the kid, since he has screaming nightmares every single night.  Then when Oswin and Meriet are sent to gather charcoal, they come across a burned skeleton -- which  is found to be a wealthy, prominent priest who was on a secret mission, and who stayed at Ashby Manor. Is Meriet truly the murderer, or is this something far darker than a crime of passion?

Finally, ""St. Peter's Fair"" opens on a nasty note when several merchants get into a brawl over fair tolls, and the next morning a wine merchant is found dead and naked in the river. Hugh Beringer thinks that the culprit is a cobbler's son who protested the tolls, but  the merchant's niece is dogged by death, theft and general mayhem. Cadfael begins to suspect that she's keeping something secret and dangerous from them. Even worse, she might be the next to die because of it.

""Brother Cadfael, Set 2 (The Virgin in the Ice, The Devil's Novice, St. Peter's Fair)"" is a somewhat darker season than the first one -- aside from the usual murder, there's a heavy load of conspiracy, rape and a gang of bandits burning and looting.

For the most part, the writers accurately adapt Ellis Peters' novels -- every mystery has lots of suspects, moral dilemmas, religious strife, civil war, a murder that only Cadfael can solve, and a bit of cute romance as well. And it has all the blood, grime and sweat of the 12th century, and accurately depicts the strong presence of religion and politicial strife in medieval life (the abbey gathers fair tolls).

Derek Jacobi remains absolutely perfect as Cadfael -- he depicts the herbalist monk as a man of faith, strength, paternal kindness and a formidable intellect. We also discover some rather startling revelations about his life after the Crusades, and a family member he never knew he had... nice twist, and quite well-written.

There are also great performances by Terrence Hardiman as the kind but stern Abbot Radulfus, Julian Firth as the fussy Brother Jerome (who accidentally gets an eyeful of a naked girl), Michael Culver as the haughty snob Prior Robert, and Mark Charnock as the oft-abused but gentle Brother Oswin (particularly brilliant in ""The Virgin in the Ice""). The one sour note: Eoin McCarthy playing a grumpy, brittle Hugh Beringer who keeps bickering with Cadfael.

""Brother Cadfael, Set 2 (The Virgin in the Ice, The Devil's Novice, St. Peter's Fair)"" is a solid trio of medieval mysteries full of blood, conspiracies and the occasional corpse. And Derek Jacobi is flawless.",1281916800,,3351,4.750430292598967
