8123962,5,B000FKP0OG,"Very well produced History Channel DVD. I ordered this for my husband, who has ties to underground mining.  This is WV, after all, with lots of underground mine tragedies.  The beginning covers the Monongah WV disaster one hundred years ago--the most devastating in history.  I will buy more History Channel DVDs this way.",1215302400,,322,5.037735849056604
