8513229,3,B007AB3RES,"More American Graffiti, 1979 film

Years have gone by since the first film. We see what happened as they grew up and went their separate ways. These are character studies of the baby boomer generation (from a humorous point of view). The music is selected to match the activities. [The split screens don't add to the story, they are used too much. Do they represent multiple viewpoints?] Do you remember those songs? Tastes have changed since then (the corporate media has control over what used to be independent stations then). The conversations document the attitudes of that era. An insurance investigator has privileges at a disturbance. [The frequent scene switches can be disconcerting.] Some of the comedy is based on the minor tragedies of that time.

Those women on the bus learn about united action. Do those drag races seem so trivial today? Its a dirty war. The customers provide entertainment at a C&W bar. The insurance agent goes for a bus ride. Milner wins a trophy. Toad goes for a long walk. They celebrate the New Year in different ways. [Will the New Year be the same as the Old Year?] The last scenes tell what happened to some of the characters. Then the credits roll. Some of the actors did better in the future. Some of the songs date after the 1966 time of this drama.

Sequels are not always as good as the originals. This movie seems more complex than the original. Were those the good old days in retrospect? The rapid changing of scenes and years breaks up the continuity. Was this done for a specific reason? Do people want to remember what they want to? This ignores the controversy over JFKs death and the other political conflicts of that era. Was the British Invasion designed to distract people from JFKs death and the war in Vietnam? Is this a musical drama about recent history? Do you have memories about this era?",1447891200,,1853,4.677914110429448

8513233,3,B007AB3RES,I just received it haven't opened it yet so don't know how well I like it.  I saw the movie when it came out originally and liked it then I got this copy because my Wife never saw it.  And then I am looking at the case it came in and realize it is written in spanish or italian or some other language I don't understand so I am almost afraid to open it in case I have to return it.  Be Very CAREFULL What you sign up for. I am afraid it may not even play on my blu ray player because it may be the wrong format.,1375488000,,511,3.669724770642202
