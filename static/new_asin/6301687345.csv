It is a high class proffessional  work and I have nothing but praise for it.  The film made me need to  go there, I want nothing more than to roam around in the unspoilt beauty of  nature at it's most powerful and awe inspiring.  If you are yet to  see this masterpiece, I advise you to do so at your soonest convenience.  My final words on this film: Life changing",939340800,7,535,4.5
