7815009,1,6301798031,I LOVE THIS FILM!  Its the DVD I have an issue with: its been FORMATTED!!!  BEWARE!!  Had I realized it had been formatted I wouldnt have purchased it. I don't like paying for half of a film.,1521158400,,191,4.108108108108108
7815010,5,6301798031,This will always be my favorite movie starring Anouk Aimee. Aimee digs deep into Durrell's character - and comes up with a totally believable Justine.  [La Dolce Vita does not show her off as Justine does.] Kudos for screen-writers: Durrell's Alexandria Quartet is well compressed into this one movie.,1487635200,2,301,5.142857142857143
7815011,2,6301798031,"I hate reading negative reviews. I hate writing one even more. But here I go....
The Alexandria Quartet by Lawrence Durrell  is one of the greatest English works of the 20th century- a masterpiece by a flawed man.
""Justine"" is a severely flawed movie derived from that masterpiece. The roles are all very well acted as mentioned elsewhere, but this project would best have been done as a series- make multiple, connected films. Perhaps Netflix or Amazon Prime could step forward?
.And in this world of download and blu-ray the opportunities to compare the first three works and then the ""capstone"" of the quartet might be remarkable.
But that is not what we have. The conception of the Quartet- a story from three aspects and its outcome-  is abandoned. Alexandria as another character in the movie is abandoned. The hunting scene critical to the first three books, abandoned. Left is a somewhat insipid story of a young man's infatuation with a muse.
Two stars for having made the effort
ZERO stars for destroying the cinematography and presenting the movie pan and scan.",1435881600,4,1072,4.884615384615385
7815012,1,6301798031,"The only good review was that Cukor made superb use of the widescreen. So what does Fox Archive do? They release it in pan & scan. How pathetic! I will not buy this and please, no one else buy it as well.",1427932800,10,204,3.880952380952381
7815013,1,6301798031,"It is unconscionable that any DVD issued in 2015 (even if on an on-demand basis) still presents a film with an OAR of 2.35:1 in the old pan-and-span 4:3 format. Justine's original scope cinematography is absolutely beautiful, but is completely butchered on this DVD, losing almost half of the screen image intended by Cukor (director) and Shamroy (cinematographer). Adding insult to injury, the transfer is barely comparable to VHS quality.",1427932800,22,440,5.3
7815014,1,6301798031,"Yet another widescreen gem being released in pan-and-scan. Do the folks at Fox Archive truly hate their customers? Maybe they should include a buggy whip with each order, or a button hook. Or, as expected, they can just keep asking for our money and then spitting in our faces. Be forewarned.",1427932800,16,292,4.745098039215686
7815015,3,6301798031,"This was a difficult book to bring to the big screen. The casting is excellent and the film is a good summary of the first three novels of the Alexandria Quartet, but you have to pay attention because a lot of information is given in a short period of time. What is lost, is the slow development of the plot from different angles in a non chronological fashion, almost like the film Memento, but 30 years before. It could be redone for the small screen over 8 to 12 episodes.",1407196800,3,475,4.288888888888889
7815016,5,6301798031,"though when it was presented at the theatres,it got very bad reviews,for me then and now,there is a magical atmosphere,which is very close,to the magical atmosphere of the book.anouk aimmee,is an actress ,of apsolute charm.i enjoed it enormousely.",1395532800,3,247,5.526315789473684
7815017,5,6301798031,"Somebody can reply me why there isn't a dvd print of this fabulous piece of retrocinema? Do it now,masters of the film rights!",1121299200,13,126,4.521739130434782
7815018,3,6301798031,"ok it was an almost impossible task to reduce  the brilliant quartet to the screen, but this was just so disappointing. more than anything, it felt, well, cold and claustrophobic.  END",898300800,2,184,4.903225806451613
