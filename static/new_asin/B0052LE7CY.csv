4530105,5,B0052LE7CY,Love this movie...wish more Sandra Brown books would be put into movies.  Perhaps in the future more good books could be put on DVD.,1394323200,,132,4.5
4530106,3,B0052LE7CY,I will give it a three only because of the actors that played in it.  It omitted so much of the book that it was not one of my favorites.,1365638400,3,137,3.566666666666667
4530107,1,B0052LE7CY,"But this movie is terrible.
Not because the acting in it is bad (Jamie Pressly is a pretty good actress) but because whomever wrote the screenplay took liberties with the book and changed what I felt were very important aspects. Also, I didn't like the lead for Raley.",1353888000,2,268,4.604166666666667
4530108,5,B0052LE7CY,"I first saw part of this movie on TV, I was impressed with it then. I am more impressed with it now that I own it and have watched it.",1316649600,4,134,3.5
4530109,1,B0052LE7CY,"A month ago I thought I had seen the worst movie of the year, well I was wrong.

Plot first, the story is about a news reporter who investigates the police and DA's office about a cover up of a police beating. Oh, there's the obligatory chase scene that was so embarrassing that bumper cars would have been more exciting. Yes, that is what we call a tiresome retread. So tiresome that even daytime TV no longer does that script.

Second, the directing, editing and camera angles for the first half of the movie consisted of multiple closeup scenes of teeth brushing and people's faces as they recite the most inane lines that only a freshman high school student could come up with.

Third, and most blatant, was the total lack of any acting skill what-so-ever. And, just to confirm I checked IMDB for past acting credits and almost, without exception, it listed for all of this cast, ""TV Series"", ""TV Series"", ""TV Series"" .... Gawd, they were awful! But, on the positive side their employment does keep the jobless rate down.

Fourth, to whoever wrote and directed this direct-to-Redbox $1 rental needs some serious life experiences and afterwards some serious 10th & 11th grade writing skills instruction.  Twelfth grade would be asking too much.",1314057600,6,1247,4.78139534883721
8453962,3,B0052LE7CY,Grandma is a huge Sandra Brown fan and we had high hopes for this movie but the acting is so cheesy that it's hard to focus on what little story there was to follow. Shipping and DVD great and in perfect condition. Just cheesy movie.,1499299200,,233,4.2
8453963,2,B0052LE7CY,"An originally made for TV low budget movie that follows the formula of using an actor from a former top rating TV show to ensure it gets at least some audience (in this case My Name is Earl's Jaime Pressly).  The problem with this one is it is so slow and boring.  Ninety-nine percent of the movie is talking.  Even a Mercedes that has the ability to magically restore its front bumper in a few seconds can't break the boredom as the story just glosses over this either possessed car or brilliant invention.  The Mercedes really should have been central to the storyline and the script written around it as the plot about waking up next to a dead body for the TV reporter, who lives in a house with a defective alarm system, then goes on the run while trying to solve the crime, really isn't a great one.  Based on a Sandra Brown novel of the same name, I imagine that was more well done than this TV movie adaptation.",1477267200,,918,4.313953488372093
