1730955,5,B0000696I9,"One of Frankenheimer's most satisfying films.  I really like the spare dialogue.  The acting is first-rate, and the filming has a free-wheeling feel lacking in Frankenheimer's later efforts.  Bonnie Bedelia, Sheree North and Debra Kerr bracket the female spectrum in one of the few Frankenheimer films to depict women as interesting as the men.
Gene Hackman's performance is memorable.  Simply terrific.",1031443200,9,403,5.557377049180328

1731006,2,B0000696I9,"I only gave this movie two stars because the plot was pretty tame, but if anyone is interested in skydiving, the film has some excellent footage and great shots.  Gene Hackman is such a fine actor and always believable.  I hadn't seen this movie for several years so was glad to view it again.  And the same week it arrived in the post, it was showing on TV!

1731007,4,B0000696I9,"I've been wanting to purchase the Gypsy Moths for quite a spell now...and just recently found it for sale on Amazon.  This John Frankenheimer Film includes movie greats Burt Lancaster; Deborah Kerr; Gene Hackman; and William Windom.  This 1969 production also features movie newcomers Scott Wilson and Bonnie Bedelia, of which both actors aptly prove to be quite accomplished and convincing in their respective roles.  The story centers around a troop of skydivers, who provide feats of aerial mastery for the residents of a small Kansas community, where the crowds have come to see the three daredevils offer up a menu of near death success or certain demise, should they fail to deploy their chutes in time.  The Gypsy Moths too brings out interpersonal relationships between Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster, an emotionally distraught woman in a loveless marriage with her husband played by William Windom; and the headliner of the skydiving trio whose own personal demons have left him despondent and constantly pushing his stunts beyond acceptable limits. Additionally; love blossoms for Wilson's and Bedelia's characters; the youngest of the skydiving trio, and the young woman desirous of his love. I guarantee The Gypsy Moths to be a keep you on the edge of your chair flick, as you watch the moth fly closer...closer...and even closer yet to the flame, not knowing if the ripcord will be pulled before the ground below writes the final epitaph.

1731008,4,B0000696I9,An old favorite film of mine that should be on DVD. Good performances but limited story that develops characters too quickly and ends too abruptly.,1360108800,,147,4.92
1731009,5,B0000696I9,"This has to me one of my favorite movies of all time. The story line tugs at your heart strings, and the acting is superb. It has to be one of the best character studies I've ever seen! Elmer Berstein's score is haunting. Check out the scene when Deborah Kerr and Bert Lancaster are in the park, and listen to the music.

1731011,3,B0000696I9,"But I couldn't do it. The talent in this film is considerable and the skydiving sequences which were primarily filmed while in free fall were ground-breaking. But the three main plots of the movie and the additional subplots just never seem to jell together. Sure there are breasts in this film, lots of them, but they never seem to make up for the rather confused nature of the film. I was surprised at how slow-paced this film was for a movie about skydiving daredevils. The plot about the Cape is interesting but I never got why they didn't call it a batwing, which is what it was.

Primarily, this movie will be of interest to people who like skydiving scenes. And breasts.",1237766400,2,677,4.549180327868853

1731013,4,B0000696I9,"I watched this movie after my interest in skydiving turned into more of an obsession than a mere hobby.  It is a great movie.  It had a lot more sex than I expected from a movie from 1968, but it was approached in a mature and realistic manner.  The DVD has a cool documentary called ""The Skydivers"" that explains the men behind all the awesome freefalling cinematography.  It also includes an insightful commentary track from the film's director.  Gene Hackman is great in this movie as the hard partying Catholic stuntman.  Burt Lancaster is relied as more of a stoic and recognizable force than a heavy-handed performance.  See this movie.",1221350400,2,642,4.781818181818182

1731015,5,B0000696I9,"this movie was very good. People that did this ""Barnstorming"" it the early years really put their lives on the line. You would really like to jump from a airplane as much as they did.

1731017,5,B0000696I9,"As all the films of this outstanding filmmaker, there's always a personal landmark behind stages; that decade found him betting for extreme sports; Grand Prix and then ""The Gypsy moths"", but with an enormous existential background behind. These brave men who defy the heights, love the danger in a very special way, the aerial acrobatics are fantastic, with a splendid edition work, on the other hand there will be three love affairs along the road which thickens the plot in its central section, but the expected exhibition on July 4th is by far, the essential dramatic nucleus of the movie.

In hands of any other filmmaker this film would have remained bellow the carpet, but Frankenheimer impressed it his author's sign.

Burt Lancaster is terrific in his role, Hackman began to rise and Scott Wilson looks very credible: kudos for Deborah Kerr in a brief but remarkable performance and a very young and alluring teenager named Bonnie Bedelia illuminates trhe scree with her serene beauty.

Mesmerizing flying scenes makes of this movie a gratifying work in a very quiet Kansas town.",1186358400,2,1087,4.994475138121547
1731018,3,B0000696I9,"This movie has special meaning to me as it is about sky divers in the late 1960's; who, like the barn stormers of early 1900's, travel from town to town putting on airial sky diving shows.  The movie was filmed at my grandparents, Harry, Twila Nelson, farm and airport in Benton, Kansas. My grandparents, father Henry Nelson, and I worked and built the airport in 1960. The airport was Nelson's Airfield.  Other parts of the movie was filmed in ElDorado, Kansas.  While filming the movie I was a freshman in high school.  I got the opportunity to meet and visit with the stars, Burt Lancaster, Gene Hackman, Deborah Kerr, William Windom, Bonnie Bedelia.  The movie is a B movie that was made back in the 1950's, 1960,s that was produced as fast and cheap as possible.  The story line is marginal and action is slow.  It is not a bad movie, but not one of the caliber that Gene Hackman and Bonnie Bedelia went on to make later in their careers.  It has some good airial views and sky diving stunts.  If you like flying, sky diving, you will enjoy some of the scenes in this movie, and if you are a fan of B movies with the early careers of some of the stars, then I recommend this movie.",1169337600,6,1186,4.3545454545454545
1731019,5,B0000696I9,"This is one of my favorite movies.  Gene Hackman was pretty much unknown at this time and his performance was worth the price of admission. The rejection Scott Wilson felt was understated, therefore more poignant. The movie was not promoted because James Aubrey(the Smiling Cobra) had taken over the studio and said no one would  be interested in Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr ""pawing each other"".  Sheree North was past her prime and it always seemed to me she accepted aging and took appropriate parts.",1155513600,2,506,4.929411764705883
1731020,2,B0000696I9,"I have to agree with Charles Hall.

Fist of all a great cast like this deserves something better (much beter). This film is ok if you really don't have anything to do and are a fan of Kerr or Lancaster's.

I was mislead into watching this cuasi-movie, again, by the reviews. But who the heck is Frankenheimer? I just wanted to see if by chance (like when the donkey blows into a flute and a wonderful note comes out unexpectedly) a non-first rate director could produce a great movie. Let's give it a chance, I said.

And I watched the whole thing because after one hour I was still expecting something to get started. But no, the whole thing was really the story, not the warm up for the story!

So besides the cast, a nice photography and -I have to say it- Ms Kerr's naked scene there's nothing really told in this thing. Yes, by the end of the movie, I had a hint that the perpetrator of this movie had wanted to tell us something, but I am not sure if it had to do with skydiving, Edipo's complex, phetishism, or what. The funny thing is that there's always going to be people who like it because they have found out there's a message in it, and that skydiving is just a metaphor of it. Well, sure, but of what?

Consume at your own risk.",1135641600,7,1243,4.227848101265823
1731021,2,B0000696I9,"This glorified soap opera is a waste of a great cast. What other reviewers call ""spare dialog"" I call unnaturallly long pauses between phrases, especially on the part of Lancaster and Kerr.

The plot seems to revolve around how these professional skydivers are afraid to jump out of planes and sometimes forget to pull their rip cord (I kid you not).

There are some swell aerial scenes at the beginning and end, plus you get to see Deborah Kerr naked, but otherwise this movie is just awful.",1134000000,3,492,4.64367816091954
1731022,4,B0000696I9,"""The Gypsy Moths"" is an almost-lost, almost-classic by legendary director John Frankenheimer. While I certainly wouldn't quibble with the five-star ratings some other users have given it here, I'd say that it's a very good movie, but not quite great.

This is not to damn ""The Gypsy Moths"" with faint praise. Yes, it's somewhat formulaic (outsiders shake up the lives of folks in a sleepy Midwestern town) and it is a bit of a soap opera. But with the addition of its skydiving story and action sequences, it's also a twist on the standard soap format. And ultimately, it's a story about what happens when characters with utterly different lifestyles and values are pushed into the same room with each other; a story of how, sometimes, envy and contempt become practically the same thing. Add to the mix the commanding presence of Burt Lancaster and a dead-on performance by Gene Hackman, and the whole thing is elevated to a higher level. Hats off, too, to director Frankenheimer for turning what could have been just a soap with some skydiving into something with a bit more substance.

Again, I wouldn't quite say that this is a great movie. The resolution is a bit too simple and the ending a bit too abrupt...at least in comparison to more contemporary standards. But ""The Gypsy Moths"" does indeed fall into the category of the undiscovered gem. And the commentary track by Frankenheimer makes this one well worth a second viewing.",1113264000,20,1436,4.833333333333333

7965265,5,B0000696I9,"Until TCM, one could only see this occasionally on late night TV. Well, late night TV movies no longer exist, but the movie has been released on DVD and it looks good. The story will at first confuse...it seems that we have dropped into a sequel for a film that was never made with two of the central characters reviving a past history of some sort...that's never expanded upon, and perhaps we are just entertaining a past that each of the persons had only fantasized about in the early years of their unfulfilled lives?  Anyhow, the psychologists can deal with that. The action scenes, while dated due to the1970 date and lack of CGI that would be used today, still are pretty good. The sound skydivers are rally doing the parachuting and skydiving. The actors are shown in close up on whatever was used instead of green screen  back then. The airplane they use was a pleasure to see inflight, a 1940s-built Howard DGA! (The actor pilot of the DGA is one of the P-40 pilots from ""Tora, Tora Tora"", by the way.) As went movies of the late 60s and early 70s, the traditional censorship by Hollywood of nudity and language had become extinct. Language was not any big deal...the F-bomb was still a taboo, but there was a bit of gratuitous nudity from the female cast members that was common to these era films...Debra Kerr was about 17 years too late to flash herself...should have been in the beach scene in ""From Here to Eternity"", but it was with her same partner, Burt Lancaster!  Sherri North and Gene Hackman were another such grouping...only Bonnie Bedelia and Scott Wilson (Hershel from ""The Walking Dead"") were youthful enough at that time to be so exhibited..and were not! So, the plot is a bit heavy and the cast is perhaps bit old, but the story is pretty good...and the parachuting is great. Skydivers worldwide will enjoy it for the primitive techniques and equipment!",1487635200,,1880,4.656626506024097

7965268,3,B0000696I9,"With Seven Days in May, Seconds and The Manchurian Candidate firmly ensconced within my personal pantheon of favorite films, anything by the mercurial director John Frankenheimer is always required  viewing. Too bad I ran into 1969's, The Gypsy Moths.

In his lust to make a great documentary about skydiving, Frankenheimer forgot that he was also making a film. A film in desperate need of an equally compelling  dramatic arc that would fully leverage the sublime roster of acting talent assembled in the persons of Burt Lancaster, Deborah Kerr and Gene Hackman.

Clearly, Frankenheimer's energies were engaged elsewhere as his signature elements of taut dialogue and visual acuity reigns all over the aerial sequences but is summarily discarded when his storyline returns to earth and sputters like a hackneyed Peyton Place pitting an aging lothario (Lancaster) against the all-encompassing ennui of the joylessly married, pearl-strewn priestess of manners and breeding  (Kerr.) To put it charitably, their out-of-body, mailed-in performances contain none of the scene-stealing passion of their incendiary collaboration in From Here To Eternity - a squandering of acting talent as unforgivable as it is inexplicable.

So, if you enjoy parachutes and gravity this half-hearted effort from Frankenheimer is sure to excite. As for me, I'm glad I visited the middle of Kansas in 1969 but I am even more gratified that I left.",1473379200,,1423,5.358744394618834
