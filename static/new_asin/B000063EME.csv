1689745,5,B000063EME,"This season's box set will prove to be even more fun to watch than its predecessor. Not only are the episodes much more witty then the first season's, the animators do an excellent job creating a professional look that was not often apparent during the first season.
The writers also enter into more social commentary than they had in the first season. Classic lines like ""That's the problem with being middle class, anyone who really cares will abandon you for someone who needs them more,"" reveal that the writers are not only writing to entertain, but to be insightful.
It's a great season. And with over 8 hours of episodes (compared to less than 5 on the first season's dics) it's a great value. If you were one of the few people disappointed with the first season's episodes, don't write off this season. Granted, season three is when the show really gets ""classic."" That said, these episodes are still better than 99% of today's TV programs. Worth having.",1015113600,14,962,4.732142857142857
1689746,5,B000063EME,"The Simpsons second season is where the writers and producers really began to test their mettle and delve away from the standard ""reality"" that grips most sitcoms.  In short, they realized this was animation and they would be able to do more and push the characters farther.  The focus in the 2nd season was still primarily on Bart, but there were other great moments.
Bart Gets An F -- Bart is in danger of being held back in the 4th grade, so me makes a deal with the class brainiac Martin Prince.
Simpson and Delilah -- Homer finds a miracle hair tonic and scams the nuclear power plant medical insurance into paying it.  He discovers that a full head of hair leads to success.  (Guest voice: Harvey Fierstein)
Treehouse of Horror -- the show that started a grand tradition of The Simpsons Halloween specials.  James Earl Jones lends his voice to read Poe's ""The Raven.""
Two Cars In Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish -- Bart catches a 3-eyed mutant fish in a pond near the nuclear plant, prompting Mr. Burns to run for governor to get the EPA off his back.
Dancin' Homer -- Homer becomes the new mascot of the Springfield Isotopes.
Dead Putting Society -- Bart and Todd Flanders end up as rivals on the mini-golf circuit.
Bart vs. Thanksgiving -- Bart ruins Lisa's Thanksgiving diorama and runs away when he's punished.
Bart the Daredevil -- Bart is enamored with being a daredevil after the family witnesses the Truckasaurus show.  For his greatest trick he decides to jump Springfield Gorge on his skateboard.  (Best episode ever!)
Itchy & Scratchy & Marge -- After Homer becomes a victim of cartoon violence, Marge takes on the creators of the ultra-violent Itchy & Scratchy cartoon.
Bart Gets Hit By a Car -- When Mr. Burns runs over Bart with his car, Homer hires Lionel Hutz (voiced by the late, great Phil Hartman) who hires the phonier Dr. Nick Rivera.
One Fish, Two Fish, Blow Fish, Blue Fish -- Homer eats the wrong part of a blowfish and believes he has 24 hours to live.  (Guest voice: George Takei)
The Way We Was -- Homer and Marge tell the story of their prom night.  (Jon Lovitz guests as Artie Ziff.)
Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment -- Homer steals cable and gets into hot water with Lisa, who believes he'll be going to hell for his actions.
Principal Charming -- Principal Skinner begins romancing Marge's sister, Patty, much to the chagrin of her other sister, Selma.
Oh Brother Where Art Thou? -- Homer discovers he has a half brother who happens to own a successful auto manufacturing company.  (Guest voice: Danny DeVito as Herb Powell)
Bart's Dog Gets an F -- Santa's Little Helper begins chewing up everything in the house, so it's off to obedience school.  (Guest voice: Tracey Ulman.)
Old Money -- when Grampa Simpson's love, Beatrice, dies, she leaves her fortune to him and a vision of her asks him to do some good with it.
A Brush With Greatness -- Mr. Burns hires Marge to paint his portrait for the local art museum.
Lisa's Substitute -- Lisa falls in love with the new substitute teacher.
The War of the Simpsons -- Homer's bad behavior forces Marge to enlist them in a martital retreat, but Homer would rather spend his time trying to catch General Sherman, the revered and legendary 500-pound catfish.
Three Men and a Comic Book -- Martin, Milhouse and Bart all pitch in to buy a copy of Radioactive Man #1.  The problem arises when they can't decide how to share the comic book.
Blood Feud -- Bart donates his rare blood to save Mr. Burns, who shows no gratitude to the Simpson family.
So, those are the episodes.  Special Features on Season 1 included commentary tracks on every episode, and we can only hope this will continue.  Even if it doesn't, let's face it, it's The Simpsons at their best and that deserves 5 stars.",1014768000,190,3778,4.586053412462908

1689773,4,B000063EME,"Season 2 of the most iconic animation in TV history is a big step up from the primitive Season 1. The animation is still done by Klasky/Csupo (and boy do I miss that style) but the quality of writing is sharper, and the diverse characters become more and more refined. With Season 2 the writers knew that this world opened up a lot of opportunities and they were able to go places that no other animated show had gone before them, which is the main reason that the Simpsons became so groundbreaking in the first place.

The animation may be a little cruder than the HD and widescreen episodes kids might be used to now but that's part of the charm. I am usually not one for nostalgia but it would be nice to Klasky/Csupo be given the chance to do this show again, even if for one episode. This season also features the very first Treehouse of Horror episode for Halloween nuts and fans of Kang and Kodos.

The show is presented in 1.33:1 with Dolby 5.1 sound and loads of extras.",1478217600,,979,4.344262295081967

1689785,5,B000063EME,"Season 2 of The Simpsons reaches a healthy, regular stride in multiple ways. Castellaneta, Kavner, Cartwright, Smith, Shearer, Azaria and their supporting voice actors reach a sustainable plateau, having settled into their roles well. Dialogue is smoother and less clunky and stilted as it was in season 1. The animation is also smoother and more crisp. You can compare the animation quality by looking at the pictures given on IMDB. The storylines are still short, cut to the point quickly (which prevents filler from making the episodes a chore to slog through) and filled to the brim with their trademark serious humour while keeping the characters realistic and relateable. This season also showcases the show's first Treehouse of Horror Halloween special, which is famous for its parodies of contemporary horror flicks such as The Shining (later seasons also include Harry Potter parodies).

In a way, every episode of the Simpsons is a fable akin to Aesop or McMurry. In Simpson and Delilah, viewers are taught to question the importance of means and ends when Homer deceives an insurance company to obtain a hair-restoration product. Similarly, when Bart gets hit by a car (but isn't terribly hurt), his father pulls out all the stops to extort money from his boss, while his mother is uncomfortable using immoral methods (lying) to obtain an unfair payout. One of my favourite (and most endearing) episodes is Bart VS Thanksgiving, where his conscience finally awakens after making his sister miserable.",1464998400,,1511,5.16734693877551

1689840,5,B000063EME,"This was a pretty amazing season of The Simpsons, with a ton of totally memorable, amazing episodes. It's also the season where Simpsons mania took off, and where the network switched it from Sundays to Thursday, where it would go head-to-head with The Cosby Show, at that time the number one show in the US. The season also introduced several lasting characters, such as Mayor Quimby, Kang and Kodos the aliens, Maude Flanders, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Roger Meyers, Jr., Sideshow Mel, Lionel Hutz, Dr. Nick Riviera, Rainier Wolfcastle, Troy McClure, Groundskeeper Willie, Hans Moleman, Professor Frink and Comic Book Guy.

The season starts off a bit slow with ""Bart Gets An F"", which is fairly moralistic and not all that funny, but then makes a lot of progress with ""Simpson And Delilah"", one of the classics. Homer grows a full head of hair (and takes a new hairstyle in every scene) as the result of some magic hair goo, and gets promoted to junior executive. Homer gets a gay male secretary Carl, and we get a bit of full male-on-male kissing, probably a first for prime time! Pictures from Mr Burns' family album and a bit more of his history! Then there's the first-ever ""Treehouse Of Horror"" with the classic alien abduction episode that introduces Kang and Kodos, and the voice of James Earl Jones/Darth Vader for one of the aliens. Then, of course, there's the classic re-telling of Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Raven"" with Marge as an ultra-big-haired Lenore, Bart as the raven, and Homer as the enraged/anguished narrator. The third tale, about the Simpsons inhabiting a haunted house, is good enough, but nothing special. ""Two Cars In Every Garage And Three Eyes On Every Fish"" is good fun, as Mr Burns campaigns for governor to out-run accusations that his nuclear power plant is the cause of genetic mutations in the surrounding environment - three-eyed fish. ""Dancin' Homer"" is okay, and we get Tony Bennett singing ""The Capital City Song"" a la ""New York, New York"", to a montage of the not-so-glamorous lights of Capital City. Quite a lot of Capital City Goofball in t his one, and we even hear him talk! ""Dead Putting Society"" has a few good scenes, like Ned's apologetic letter to Homer, and Bart's Zen-like Karate Kid training for a putting tournament. But ""Bart Vs. Thanksgiving"" is a standout, with a gleeful dream sequence where all the Simpsons family accuse him of something (apparently animated by Eric Stefani of the band No Doubt). ""Bart The Daredevil"" has the classic scene of Homer jumping the Springfield Gorge that just has to be seen to be believed. ""Itchy & Scratchy & Marge"" has the classic tribute to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, where Maggie ""kills"" Homer, as well as a Marge cameo in an Itchy and Scratchy episode as an irritating pest (I think you can see where that would go...). ""Bart Gets Hit By A Car"" has that great ""Bart in Heaven, Bart in Hell"" scene that animates a Heironymous Bosch painting, and the Devil working away at an early Apple Macintosh. ""One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish"" shows how Homer would live the last day of his life, plus some classic scenes in a sushi restaurant The Happy Sumo, including Bart and Lisa doing ""Theme to Shaft"" on the karaoke stage. Classic! Mrs Krabappel even makes an appearance!! ""The Way We Was"" is probably one of the best Simpsons episodes, as it shows young Homer and young Marge meeting, dating, boogying to music of the time, Abe Simpson giving his son a heart-to-heart, and the voice of Jon Lovitz doing Artie Ziff. ""Marge, I would appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about my busy hands. Not so much for myself, but I am so respected, it would damage the town to hear it."" There's also a rare appearance of Marge's dad. ""Homer Vs. Lisa And The 8th Commandment"" is a so-so moralistic episode where Lisa pictures the Simpsons in Hell (someone must have liked it, though - it won an Emmy)!! ""Principal Charming"" is about Principal Skinner dating Marge's sisters, it's a riot end-to-end, especially the scene where Homer is trying to figure out who would go out with one of them. Karl? No... too attractive. They have dinner in the ""Sit-And-Rotate Room"", a revolving restaurant on top of Springfield Tower, heh heh... Also the ""Homer sexual"" joke goes out of control! ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a so-so episode about Homer finding his long-lost stepbrother; ""Bart's Dog Gets An F"" is a so-so episode about Santa's Little Helper going to obedience school. ""Old Money"" is a so-so episode about Abe's brief romance with Bea Simmons. ""Brush With Greatness"" makes up for it, though, with Marge getting back into painting - tons of great jokes here, including her paintings of Ringo Starr (!), her painting of Homer passed out on the couch (!!) and her portrait of a nude Mr Burns (!!!). ""Lisa's Substitute"" has one of the best guest voices I've heard so far - Dustin Hoffman; strangely, he didn't want to be billed, so he's credited as ""Sam Etic"", whatever that refers to (Semitic? Semantic?). Great Mrs Robinson reference, and plenty of great scenes with Lisa. ""The War Of The Simpsons"" starts off with some nutty party where Homer gets drunk and makes eyes at Maude Flanders' chest... ouch!! Then it gets silly... although we do have the debut of Nelson's sneering ""Ha-ha"", although here it's ""Ha-ha-ha""... ""Three Men And A Comic Book"" is all about Radiation Man, pretty hilarious, some Richie Rich jokes (""Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money really is and took his own life.""), a flashback to a little girl Marge Simpson and her lightbulb baking oven. ""Blood Feud"" is a so-so season finale showing Mr Burns nearly dying, saved by Bart's blood transfusion. Oh well!

The bonus features are pretty amazing too! There's the totally embarrassing American Music Awards (2:00) that Nancy Cartwright did in full yellow Bart Simpson costume, suffering for her art (amazingly, this comes with commentary from the regular commentary track dudes, mostly talking about what a trooper Nancy is for doing something like this), the video for the song ""Deep Deep Trouble"" (3:38), with lots of ""hair and beard"" commentary. There's the ""Do The Bartman"" video (5:50), with Brad Bird commentary saying that this project, which they did in Budapest, was probably the single-most difficult job he's ever had to do, the video was completed just in the nick of time for broadcast. Apparently Michael Jackson was involved too!! They refer to Rusty Nails being an Oregon reference and the source of Krusty the Clown?! Three Butterfingers commercials (1:20), with Bart reading a book called Electricity Made E-Z. A documentary called ""David Silverman on the creation of an episode"" (6:10), where Silverman narrates the creation of an episode, down to the exposure sheet details, and the collaboration with production companies in South Korea; apparently, an episode takes 7-8 weeks from start to finish. ""Emmy Awards Presentation"" (2:55) is pretty cool, because they animated for TV the Simpsons family going up to the stage and reading out nominations (the audience is laughing because they can see it on the screen, but there was nothing in the actual auditorium obviously). ""Look, Mom, Harry Hamlin!"" ""Interview with Matt Groening and James L Brooks"" (9:??) rehashes the creation of the Simpsons, and is similar to what they put together around the time of Season 1, but with Season 2 footage in it. ""Art of the Simpsons"" has a bunch of stuff: ""Bart Gets An F"" storyboards (20 storyboards, from Page 133-152), ""Bart vs Thanksgiving"" storyboards (4 storyboards and one extra, from page 188, 188A, 198, rooftop long shot). ""Early sketches and drawings"" (39 images: six from ""Bart Gets An F"", seven from ""Treehouse Of Horror"", seven from ""Bart vs Thanksgiving"", five from ""The Way We Was"", seven from ""Old Money"", five from ""Blood Feud"", two random). Then there's 18 magazine covers, which are fascinating because they show the superstar machine in motion, and how initially they were taking on the Cosby Show before they blew the Cosby Show away; there's also my favourite cover - a three-way split of Simpsons, Cosby Show and Arsenio Hall, marking probably the only time Agent Cooper and Bart Simpson have shared space! Then we get a sample clip of Bart and Lisa hooking the three-eyed fish presented in German, Hungarian, Portuguese, Spanish.",1422316800,,8329,4.88967468175389

1689865,5,B000063EME,"""Welcome to Season Two of The Simpsons on DVD - twenty-two jam-packed episodes of malicious cartoon frivolity that helped make 1990 and 1991 such entertaining and annoying years. This is when full-blown Simpsons Mania hit America, and millions of thoughtful young people across the land were either wearing or selling bootleg Bart Simpson T-shirts.

Many of the episodes from this season remain among my all time favs. I'm particularly fond of Bart's pride in getting a grade of D-minus at the end of ""Bart Gets an F""; the debut of the ever-slobbering Kang and Kodos in the first annual Treehouse of Horror episode; Homer almost making it across Springfield Gorge on Bart's skateboard; Mr. Burns taking a reluctant bite of Blinky, the three-eyed fish; Maggie bonking Homer with a mallet after watching an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon; Bart going to Hell in ""Bart Gets Hit by a Car""; and the flashback scene in ""The Way We Was"", when Homer catches his first glimpse of Marge in high school (she was hot).

So put on a ratty old Simpsons t-shirt, grab a bowlful of heavily-salted snacks, and sink into the couch for a marathon of Simpsons classics. Enjoy!

It's still held in with glue, but it seems like a stronger glue as well, but that's just the base of the internal holder, the rest snap into place and turn like the pages of a book.",1397347200,,525,4.26

1689894,5,B000063EME,"Simpsons season 2 brings us 22 great episodes with some holiday inspired episodes as well. Episodes that continue on in the series today like The Treehouse of Horror series (my personal favs) I feel they did a great take on Edgar Allen Poes ""The Raven"". Although they don't have a Christmas episode this season, they do have a Thanksgiving episode ""Bart vs. Thanksgiving"" where Bart runs away after being scolded by the family after he destroys Lisa's centerpiece for the table. This episode has a heart warming feel to it as Bart and Lisa overcome a fight and their sibling bond grows a bit stronger. This season is also the first to have a blast from the past in the episode ""The Way We Was"". This is when Marge first meets Homer in high school detention and Homer tries to win her heart... or at least a prom date at the time.

 The Simpsons also won another Emmy in this season, The Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program for episode ""Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment"". Homer gets free cable in this episode and Lisa protest against it. Feeling like his daughter lost respect for him, Homer does the right moral thing and cuts the free cable. This season also introduces quite a few Simpsons characters that made a permanent home in Springfield such as Comic book Guy, Dr. Nick Riviera, Sideshow Mel, Kang and Kodos, and many others.

Special features include 2 music videos. ""Do the Bartman"" and ""Deep Trouble"" Butterfinger commercials with the Simpsons, The Simpsons presenting at the Emmy Awards and the American Music Awards. There are also interviews with the creators Matt Groening and James L. Brooks. As the earlier season had, the commentaries are here as well on the episodes and are great to listen to as in the first season.

What I didn't like was having to click ""Ok"" several times to get to the DVD Episode selection. When the DVD starts, you are presented with a spinner that each time you click ok, it spins around and mixes and matches heads.

Season 10 and 11 disappointed me so much that I stopped watching them but the first 5 seasons are classics with many unforgettable episodes. 4th and 5th season are the best for their comedy and they used to be my favorite but the first 2 seasons became my favorite eventually. There's a certain edge to the early episodes that the show gradually lost with age. The stories have more serious parts throughout but I still got a good amount of laughs, particularly Bart making crank calls to Moe's Tavern. I'll always look back and remember the show in it's early days with a rough, grainy sketching. This was the real Simpsons and the show was at it's peak here. Two Cars In Every Garage, Three Eyes On Every Fish is my favorite episodes but all are great.

Now I never have to remember a physical object: I just log onto the classroom computer and show this to the students. Perfect! It's not HD, but that's really not necessary when viewing a 25 year old animated TV show.

Regarding this particular episode, I think this is one of the greatest ""Simpsons"" ever, containing some really hilarious lines (e.g., Dr. Hibberts saying ""You have 24 hours to live--well, 22. I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long."" then Homer launching into a riff on Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's five stages of grief) and also a surprisingly profound exploration of what matters in life.

Reminds me of going to visit relatives and watching Simpsons during Thanksgiving or Christmas with the family (before the show got too preachy after season 10) and us genuinely laughing at the animated hilarity together.  It was something I'm glad to have in my heart, and the Simpsons were the emulsifier and the ice breaker for meeting many new friends along my life.  A good barometer for people was to watch an episode of the Simpsons with them.  If they didn't like it, chances were our personalities were just too different.  Unfortunately this trick only worked within the confines of the first 10 seasons, after that they become aimless and a bit contrived.

1689952,3,B000063EME,"Some of the best ever episodes of ""The Simpsons"" are included here as the reason this entire franchise has been so successful is for me because of the intelligent script and the genius of James L Brooks. The drawings of the characters are naturally still raw as they are not the finished product that we have become used to over the years but this is acceptable given the quality of the gags and the great story-telling. These episodes though have been transferred from a poor videotape master as we frequently get the shimmering, crooked lines that you get on a bad video when the tape sticks to the playing magnetic head of the player and this is very evident in every episode which took away a great deal from my overall enjoyment of the dvds. I don't remember seeing these when they were screened on tv and so it's unfortunate that for a ""Collector's Edition"" that we should get such poor dvd picture quality transfer although I have to say the sound quality on Dolby 5.1 surround is pretty good.

Overall, great episodes, sound quality but poor picture quality transfer from what appears to be a videotape with all its inherent limitations.",1256428800,11,1145,4.6683168316831685

Every episode is a winner, but for me the standouts are ""Lisa's Substitute"" (Dustin Hoffman's voices a substitute teacher that replaces Homer in Lisa's affections), ""Three Men and a Comic Book"" (Bart, Millhouse, and Martin buy an issue of Radioactive Man #1, then cannot trust each other alone with it in a hilarious nod to the classic ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""), ""Itchy & Scratchy & Marge"" (any episode with Itchy & Scratchy is great, but here Marge forces them to become kinder, gentler characters), and ""Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish"" (Mr. Burns may be the funniest character on the show).",1224201600,,702,4.801652892561983
1689957,5,B000063EME,"I've heard time and again that season 2 of The Simpsons was where the series really started to show its true potential. And I have to say, I couldn't agree more. True it was still somewhat choppy even here, but the improvement in quality over season 1 is still undeniable. While a blind person like myself can't appreciate the improved quality of the animation, it's cool to hear the difference in some of the character voices from season 1 versus season 2. Homer and Mr. Burns are particularly noticeable in this area as Dan Castellaneta and Harry Shearer became more comfortable with those voices. Even Moe sounds different, although it will be several seasons yet before Chief Wiggum's voice is well-established.
  Now let's discuss the episodes. It's been stated again and again, but this is the first season to feature what will become the annual Treehouse of Horror special. This particular one happens to be one of my absolute favorites. The Bad Dreamhouse sketch is probably my favorite, although it would be followed closely by The Raven. Of course Hungry are the Damned is well worth watching also, as it features the alien pair we've come to know and love.
  Other notable episodes are Bart gets an F, Bart gets Hit by a Car, which is the first time a Simpson encounters god (though in this instance it's only his voice on a Public Address system on the escalator to Heaven), and Oh Brother, where art thou, in which Homer learns of his half brother Herb. This set also features the video for Deep Deep Trouble, which I remember watching when it aired on Fox the first time.
  All in all this is an excellent season. It was the first season I ever saw on DVD, when my sister's now husband loaned it to me to watch when both he and my sister were at work. It provided me hours of nostalgic entertainment on what would otherwise have been long, boring days spent alone in a two-bedroom apartment. The audio commentary is also very interesting, and the fact that the episodes can also be listened to in French is also highly amusing.
  One thing I like about this season and about season 1 is that the menus, though not spoken, are simple enough that a totally blind person could, with a little assistance, learn to navigate the important ones fairly easily. And for me, all you'd need to do would be show me how to access the episode selection menu and the languages and commentary and I'd have it made. To cut a long ramble short though, if you're collecting Simpsons DVD's, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not picking up this one.",1223337600,,2549,4.599118942731278
1689958,5,B000063EME,"Like a lot of longtime fans of The Simpson, i consider season two to be where the show really broke out and started it`s classic era. The main reason why season two is so great is that it showcased more of the other characters beside Bart like Homer(who really came into his own in the season), Marge, Lisa and Mr. Burns. I felt that this greatly helped the growth of the show in terms of creativity and popularity. If Matt Groening had stuck to the formula of season one where most of the episodes are centered around Bart, then i don`t think that The Simpsons would be near as popular and a culture staple as they are today. Favorite episodes: Bart The Daredevil, Itchy & Scratchy & Marge and The Way We Was.

The high point of season two, the real reason to make sure that you own it is that this seasons begins the annual tradition that is the ""Treehouse of Horror"" specials that have always been amazingly done.  This particular episode gives us the amazing creation of the Simpsons doing ""The Raven"" as read by the great James Earl Jones.

I do think it would be nice if you could find this info on Amazon (just like the track list for a CD) but this is one alternative.

Aside from the classics ""Bart Gets An F"", this set also includes the first ""Treehouse of Horror"" epsidoe, which has become an anual Halloween tradition for the Simpsons that still lives on today.

""Dancin' Homer"" is another excellent episode, where Homer becomes the mascot of a minor league baseball team.  However, when he gets ""called up"" to the majors, he realizes that it's not just hard for the players to make it;  it's even harder for mascots.  This has some great satire about pro baseball and the fluff that surrounds it and is a must-watch for any baseball fan looking for a laugh.

The animation is much smoother and with an excellent transfer it shows up well on even the largest screens. The writing is sharper and the first of many wisecracking episodes allow the cast, who have grown into their roles, to shine brightly and sound top notch in both Dolby Digital 5.1 and regular stereo (as well as other languages).

Every episode has an audio commentary, which from previous experience are worthwhile listening to. Look out for the hilarious discussion about haircuts and beards! Various other bonus features include story boards and the often cringe-worthy early promotional material.

Overall an extremely slick and well-rounded package which should appeal to any fan of this animation phenomenon.",1154304000,3,844,5.237037037037037
1689980,5,B000063EME,"Season 1 of the Simpsons was entertaining.  There are a lot of funny moments, and the series certainly delivered from the beginning.  Season 2, though, is when we really start to see glimpses of the creative genius that would permeate the series for years to come.  The first season seems to revolve around Bart, and by the Third and Fourth seasons Homer seems to be the star, but season 2 features every member of the family really coming into their own as clearly defined characters.  This season also marked the first of the ""Treehouse of Horror"" series.

Some of my favorite episodes are from Season 2.  The War of the Simpsons, where Marge and Homer work on their marital problems at a mountain retreat, Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment, where Homer steals cable and faces the wrath of his 8 year old daughter, and Dancin' Homer, which features one of Homer's seemingly endless occupational stints, this time as the mascot for the local baseball team are among my favorites.  Watch this season, see the genius really begin to find its footing, and see the future potential the series had.  These episodes are classic.",1151366400,3,1128,4.748717948717949

In this second offering Season 2, we get to become more comfortable with the charactes.  Homer's voice is much more subdued now, less rough, and Marge seems to be much more motherly.

The kids are pretty much the same.  Bart might be a bit more obnoxious in this season, but you can pretty much say that for every seasons moving forward.

I won't sit here and give you a synopis of every episode, that is not what a review is. But I will highly recommend this season.  I have every season released so far, on DVD, and I proudly display this with the other six seasons of Seasons 1 - 7 on my DVD shelf at home.

1689982,5,B000063EME,"By the times The Simpsons hit Season 2, it was fast-becoming a massive hit in America. Worldwide success would follow in this season and also the next season, but it's not hard to see why when you look back at the number of classic episodes. Season 2 isn't my favourite of, say, the first five, but it's still a near-perfect collection of episodes which just work brilliantly back to back. That's one of the main reasons for buying this DVD box set. Matt Groening's creation was in the early stages of being fully realised in Season 1, but with Season 2, we can actually see the progression of the show's transition through these 22 episodes.

The first episode is ""Bart Gets An F."" Bart is forced to study for a test even though a snow day tempts him to indulge in the street activities. ""Simpson And Delilah"" is a great episode where Homer grows a healthy head of hair. When he meets Karl, his career reaches dizzying heights. ""Treehouse Of Horror"" is the first ever in this now-classic series of episodes. There are three mini-horror stories in this episode told by Bart and Lisa to try and scare each other. ""Two Cars In Every Garage And Three Eyes On Every Fish"" is a truly classic episode in which Mr. Burns runs for local governor and employs a team intent on portraying him as the all-loving citizen he really isn't. In ""Dancin' Homer,"" Homer becomes a famous mascot for the Springfiled Isotopes. He soon realises that a move to Capital City isn't such a wise move. ""Dead Putting On Society"" sees Homer at war with Flanders. Their sons, Bart and Todd, show an interest in miniature golf, which prompts Homer to bet Flanders that his son will beat his. The father of whoever loses must mow their lawn in a dress.

In ""Bart Vs. Thanksgiving,"" Bart destroys Lisa's thanksgiving centrepiece. He runs away from home, but soon realises the true meaning of family. ""Bart The Daredevil"" is a great episode in which Bart becomes obsessed with performing death-defying stunts after seeing Lance Murdock. He becomes intent on jumping Springfield Gorge, but Homer stops him just in time, only to go toppling down the gorge himself. In ""Itchy & Scratchy & Marge,"" Maggie clubs Homer over the head. Marge is horrified and forms a massive protest against violence in cartoons. In ""Bart Gets Hit By A Car,"" Bart is hit by a car that Burns and Smithers were driving. Homer sees the potential to make money, and employs a phoney law suit. In ""One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish,"" Homer eats a poisonous blow fish. He has one day to live, so embarks on a quest to do all the things he needs to before he dies. When he doesn't die, Marge is delighted, and Homer vows to live every day to the fullest.

""The Way We Was"" is the first flash back episode of the show, in which we see how Homer and Marge got together. It was a long and rocky road, but they got there eventually! ""Homer Vs. Lisa And The 8th Commandment"" sees Lisa concerned about people stealing to the point where she vows not to watch cable, which Homer has bought illegally. In ""Principal Charming,"" Marge urges Homer to set her sister Selma up with a man. Homer thinks Principal Skinner would be the perfect guy, but he falls for Selma's sister Patty. In ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Homer tracks down his long lost brother, who is a rich and powerful businessman. Getting involved with the Simpsons leaves him penniless and ruined, though, showing the effect that this troublesome family has on anyone! In ""Bart's Dog Gets An F,"" Santa's Little Helper grows out of control. Homer wants to give him away when he eats his large cookie and destroys a blanket Lisa has been working on.

In ""Old Money,"" Grandpa Simpson hits it off with Beatrice, an elderly widow at Springfield's retirement home. She leaves him $100,000 when she unexpectedly drops dead. ""Brush With Greatness"" is a great episode where Marge is urged by Lisa to take up her childhood hobby of painting. She wins an award for painting Homer on the couch in his underwear. Mr. Burns is intrigued and commissions her to paint the real him. When Marge realises the true nature of his bad attitude, she paints the REAL Montgomery Burns! In ""Lisa's Substitute,"" Lisa becomes smitten with Mr. Bergstrom, a cool, sexy substitute teacher. In ""The War Of The Simpsons,"" Marge and Homer go for marriage counselling while Grandpa looks after the kids at home.

In ""Three Men And A Comic Book,"" Bart, Milhouse and Marten combine their earnings to buy a $100 classic first edition of Radioactive Man. In the final episode of the season, ""Blood Feud,"" Mr. Burns needs a blood donor. He has a rare blood type, and only Bart can donate his blood. The transfusion takes place, but Bart receives nothing in return but a thank you note. Homer finds this unacceptable because he expected a massive pay out. He writes an angry letter to Burns, which is accidentally posted.

The many characters that also infiltrate this classic show become more defined in Season 2. Mr. Burns is a particular favourite of mine, and Smithers is the perfect balance between his humour. Selma and Patty are two timeless additions to the show, and their blunt humour is something I found hilarious time and time again. Flanders, Principal Skinner, Mrs. Krabappel, Barney and of course Krusty are fully developed in this season which is another one of the reasons why it is so essential! The opening credits are a bit messed up in this season with many of the family-gathering-around-the-TV-set moments from each episode repeated a few times. All in all, this is another truly essential DVD box set of The Simpsons. Then again, which box set isn't truly essential?",1150329600,2,5645,4.6797583081570995

----------

The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season is definitely better than the first. They are both worth getting though, but with season two classics such as: Simpson in Delilah, Dancin' Homer, Bart The Daredevil, One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish, Homer Vs. Lisa And The 8th Commandment, and Three Men And A Comic book, this season is a must buy. It has so many great Simpsons episodes; more greats in one season than any other boxset available.

1689995,5,B000063EME,"Season 2 of The Simpsons is when the series really shows why it has become the cultural phenomenon that it is.  Better scripts, more fleshed out characters, and better animation bolstered its appeal, making the show one of the most popular and longest running shows in history (and remember, this show is animated, which, in the early 90's, was thought of as ""kids' stuff"").

In Season 2, many of the memorable side characters are either introduced or fleshed out.  There were only a few characters in Season 1 that would go on to receive the recognition that they have now, and even those that did usually lacked their trademark personalities.  Ned Flanders, the Simpsons' neighbor, was shown this year to be a bible-thumping goodie-good, while Waylan Smithers, Mr. Burns' personal assistant, and Marge's sister Patty started to show hints of their true sexuality.  Some characters introduced this year were the Flanders kids Rod and Todd, Marge's old flame Artie Ziff, and the (until very recently) nameless Comic Book Guy (who was given the name Jeff Albertson in the show's 16th season).

This year also had episodes that truly stood out.  Dead Putting Society, O Brother Where Art Thou, the first Halloween Treehouse of Horror, Itchy and Scratchy and Marge, Bart Gets Hit By a Car (""Just give him a nickel and let's get going!""), Three Boys and a Comic Book, and Homer vs. Lisa and the Eighth Commandment.  Most of them include great social commentary, hilarious paroides of movies/books, and great stand-alone jokes, such as Bart's response to the old question, ""What's the sound of one hand clapping?"".

This season offers a few more laughs than the last season, and the quality has improved.  ALthough it is still not the same side splitting humore and laughs treated to us in later seasons, it is still a worthwhile purchase for the true simpsons fan.  This is where the show really started to come into it's own.  This season was the proving grounds it seems.  ANd yes, though some episodes really become dry and lack in some areas,  it's still  got some real classic moments.  such as the first Treehouse Of Horror and classic Milhouse moments.

1690000,5,B000063EME,"The Simpsons was at the height of their mainstream popularity in 1990/1991; Their second season aired then, and was wildly successful for good reason. These are great shows!

First off, this is a full season - 22 episodes, compared to the 13 of Season 1. So you're getting more bang for your buck (granted, it costs a little more). Secondly, these are better shows than Season 1, which looks a bit primitive today (but still highly enjoyable).

The animation and what not isn't quite up to today's standard, but it's an improvement over Season 1, which looks a bit crude at times. The characters become more developed, as well as new characters being introduced. Bart is still somewhat of the main star (just look at all the episode titles with ""Bart"" in them), but Homer starts to evolve more into the Homer we know and love - that includes his voice and demeanor. He's still not quite as bumbling and moronic as today, but he's getting there.

There's some excellent writing on here; ""Bart Gets an F"" and ""Bart's Dog Gets an F"" are fantastic Bart stories that showcase his childlike struggles. The latter is quite moving towards the end, while funny at the same time - a sign of great writing.

There's too much on here to cover all of them, but lots of highlights. ""The Way We Was"" is a great flashback episode that shows how Homer and Marge met in high school. ""Bart the Daredevil"" contains a famous scene with Homer brutally falling down a cliff (twice). The clip has been shown on multiple flashback episodes to the point where they poked fun at it recently (""No Dad, everyone's sick of that memory!"").

""Lisa's Substitute"" is possibly the best episode on here, and really showcases Homer's rapidly increasing stupidity; also, Dustin Hoffman (uncredited) as Mr. Bergstrom is a great cameo.

There's even a really good Grampa based episode with ""Old Money"". It's not quite the same rambling, senile Grampa we know today.

As a sidenote, there's a blink-and-you'll miss it scene in ""Principle Charming"" where Homer is in line at the DMV. One of the people there is Barney, with a baby! This even goes unacknowledged in the commentary, and it's just a funny thing to see, since Barney was never known to have a kid.

Special features are plentiful; the commentary of course, is always good. Also, Bart Simpson's two music videos are featured on here, as well as his Butterfinger spots. All great relics of Bartmania.

There's tons more classic episodes on here to be found (""War of the Simpsons"", ""Blood Feud"", ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?"", etc.). The humor, character development, and writing was all in top form, and would only get better (peaking around Season 5, IMO). This set is well worth your $40.",1118534400,,2708,4.732484076433121

""Treehouse Of Horror"" is the first ever in this now-classic series of episodes. There are three mini-horror stories in this episode told by Bart and Lisa to try and scare each other. ""Two Cars In Every Garage And Three Eyes On Every Fish"" is a truly classic episode in which Mr. Burns runs for local governor and employs a team intent on portraying him as the all-loving citizen he really isn't. In ""Dancin' Homer,"" Homer becomes a famous mascot for the Springfiled Isotopes. He soon realises that a move to Capital City isn't such a wise move when his new career collapses. ""Dead Putting On Society"" sees Homer at war with Flanders. Their sons, Bart and Todd, show an interest in miniature golf, which prompts Homer to bet Flanders that his son will beat his. The father of whoever loses must mow their lawn in a dress. The boys tie, Homer and Flanders have to both mow the lawn in a dress, Flander's enjoys it, Homer is disgusted!

In ""Bart Vs. Thanksgiving,"" Bart destroys Lisa's thanksgiving centrepiece, causing the whole family to say he's ruined thanksgiving. He runs away from home, but soon realises the true meaning of family. ""Bart The Daredevil"" is a great episode in which Bart becomes obsessed with performing death-defying stunts after seeing Lance Murdock. He becomes intent on jumping Springfield Gorge, but Homer stops him just in time, only to go toppling down the gorge himself. In ""Itchy & Scratchy & Marge,"" Maggie clubs Homer over the head. Marge is horrified and forms a massive protest against violence in cartoons. In ""Bart Gets Hit By A Car,"" Bart is hit by a car that Burns and Smithers were driving. Homer sees the potential to make money, and employs a phoney law suit. In ""One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish,"" Homer eats a poisonous blow fish. He has one day to live, so embarks on a quest to do all the things he needs to before he dies. When he doesn't die, Marge is delighted, and Homer vows to live every day to the fullest - before watching a pro bowling match over the credits.

""The Way We Was"" is the first flash back episode of the show, in which we see how Homer and Marge got together. It was a long and rocky road, but they got there eventually! ""Homer Vs. Lisa And The 8th Commandment"" sees Lisa concerned about people stealing to the point where she vows not to watch cable, which Homer has bought illegally. In ""Principal Charming,"" Marge urges Homer to set her sister Selma up with a man. Homer thinks Principal Skinner would be the perfect guy, but when he falls for Selma's sister Patty, Patty is forced to put her sister first over Skinner's feelings. In ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Homer tracks down his long lost brother, who is a rich and powerful businessman. Getting involved with the Simpsons leaves him penniless and ruined, though, showing the effect that this troublesome family has on anyone! In ""Bart's Dog Gets An F,"" Santa's Little Helper grows out of control. Homer wants to give him away when he eats his large cookie and destroys a blanket Lisa has been working on while she has the mumps.

In ""Old Money,"" Grandpa Simpson hits it off with Beatrice, an elderly widow at Springfield's retirement home. She leaves him $100,000 when she unexpectedly drops dead, and it's up to him to spend the money wisely. ""Brush With Greatness"" is a great episode where Marge is urged by Lisa to take up her childhood hobby of painting. She wins an award for painting Homer on the couch in his underwear. Mr. Burns is intrigued and commissions her to paint the real him. When Marge realises the true nature of his bad attitude, she paints the REAL Montgomery Burns! In ""Lisa's Substitute,"" Lisa becomes smitten with Mr. Bergstrom, a cool, sexy substitute teacher. In ""The War Of The Simpsons,"" Marge and Homer go for marriage counselling while Grandpa looks after the kids at home. Typically, things go awry.

In ""Three Men And A Comic Book,"" Bart, Milhouse and Marten combine their earnings to buy a $100 classic first edition of Radioactive Man. In the final episode of the season, ""Blood Feud,"" Mr. Burns needs a blood donor. He has a rare blood type, and only Bart can donate his blood. The transfusion takes place, but Bart receives nothing in return but a thank you note. Homer finds this unacceptable because he expected a massive pay out. He writes an angry letter to Burns, which is accidentally posted. Burns vows revenge, but is warned by Smithers to think twice. Instead, he buys them a rare of Olmec Indian Head which fills their living room!

The many characters that also infiltrate this classic show become more defined in Season 2. Mr. Burns is a particular favourite of mine, and Smithers is the perfect balance between his humour. Selma and Patty are two timeless additions to the show, and their blunt humour is something I found hilarious time and time again. Apu, Flanders and his family, Reverend Lovejoy, Principal Skinner, Mrs. Krabappel, Moe, Barney, Milhouse, Comic Book Guy and of course Krusty are fully developed in this season which is another one of the reasons why it is so essential! The opening credits are a bit messed up in this season with many of the family-gathering-around-the-TV-set moments from each episode repeated a few times. All in all, this is another truly essential DVD box set of The Simpsons. Then again, which box set isn't truly essential?",1116028800,2,6527,4.68613775065388
1690002,5,B000063EME,"Many consider the Simpsons early seasons the golden years with funny episodes and clever satire. The first season had some kind of bad animation and basic plots while here it started to become the season it is(or was depending on your views). This review contains episode highlights.

The season kicks off with Bart Gets an F where Bart has to cram for a history test but having trouble finding time to study. Then there's the first of the annual Treehouse of Horror halloween episodes with an incredibly well done segment on Poe's the Raven, narrated by James Earl Jones.

Bart the Daredevil finds Bart finding inspiration in the daredevil Lance Murdoch and wants to jump Springfield Gorge. Only Homer ends up doing it...barely in a classic scene. Later on, Homer attends a japanese restaurant and eats fish that if not cut right can be poisonous. So he tries to get all his to-do list items done before his time's up.

Then in the first of many flashback episodes, we get the story of how Homer fell in love with Marge. In the episode Oh Brother, Where Art Thou, Homer finds his long-lost half brother Herb but Homer bankrupts his car company in no time flat.

Even though it aired in the typical season finale May period, the episode Three Men and a Comic Book was the second to last which dealt with Bart, Martin and Milhouse chipping in to buy a very rare Radioactive Man comic only to find none of them wants to share. Then in the ""season finale"" Mr Burns gets ill and needs rare blood from Bart. After getting better, Mr Burns thanks the family in a card, rather than in riches like Homer wants.

It's funny that many classic episodes and characters are all in the second season and it'll get better as it goes on.",1115769600,,1721,4.538709677419355
1690003,5,B000063EME,"Originally a spin-off from a one-minute segment of The Tracy Ullman Show, The Simpsons morphed into the then-burgeoning FOX network's most successful program. As the longest running animated television show in history, and the longest running prime show of any type, The Simpsons is an American treasure - a combination of humor, wit, and satire that examines not just the lives of its eccentric characters, but also the society, culture, and world in which we live. Fun for adults and children alike, The Simpsons is a cutting edge television comedy that, like Seinfeld, changed the television landscape in the 1990's by creating a new genre of TV fun - spawning large network investments in new series such as King of the Hill, Futurama, and The Family Guy.

Like all new things which smash the paradigm of life, The Simpsons is unrivaled by its knockoffs, and the show doesn't show signs of slowing down. If you haven't yet visited Springfield, then I definitely recommend that you pick up The Simpsons DVD (Season 1) to catch a glimpse for yourself. You have no idea what you've been missing...

The Simpsons (Season 2) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which Bart makes a deal with school nerd Martin Prince. Bart will make Martin cool if Martin agrees to tutor Bart into a top-notch student. When Martin reneges on his end of the deal, Bart must pass on his own merit, and his D- earns the respect of Homer and Mrs. Krabappel. In ""Treehouse of Horror"" (#16), Bart and Lisa take turns telling horror stories in an episode foreshadowing the Simpson Halloween Specials which followed in years to come. Other notable episodes include ""Dancin' Homer"" in which Homer becomes the local minor league team's mascot and ""Itchy & Scratchy & Marge"" in which Marge takes on the cartoon violence warping Springfield's youth...

1690006,5,B000063EME,"The Simpsons is truly a magnificent show. I've watched this since I was a little kid and still laugh at the old re-runs played every week, so I went out and bought the season box-sets. This show has really exploded into pop culture and has become a part of our everyday lifes. Anyway, this DVD box set has a lot to offer. It has 22 wonderful episodes from the 2nd season and with audio commentary on each one.

This season has a lot more maturity, great stories, growing gags and family-related issues which started Simpsons mania in the 1990's and setted up what would become the greatest animated show ever!! To me, this season proved to have some of it's most memorable moments in the history of the show. As an avid fan, I love to hear what the writers/producers have to say on the commentaries - about how the show has developed as well as techniques and trademarks that makes the show so special.

Extras involved in this set include music videos from The Simpsons album - 'Do the Bartman' and 'Deep Deep Trouble', a look at artwork and multi-language scenes, interviews, award ceremonies of the family presenting at the American Music Awards and The Emmy's, plus much much more.

The Second Season has some of my personal favourite episodes from 'One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish' where Homer eats a blowfish and is given 24 hours to live. Another all-time favourite is 'Lisa's Substitute' where Lisa develops a crush on her substitute teacher. Both these episodes are very emotional at the end and are ones to show to the sensitive types. But for those who are after a laughing workout then classic episodes like 'Bart The Daredevil' and 'Blood Feud' should get you going.

All in all there isn't a single bad episode in the lot and I recommend that all people who love and watch the show should go out and buy this!! A must for every TV buff.",1104019200,,1858,4.57057057057057
1690007,5,B000063EME,"THIS is the birth of the modern Simpsons as we know them. All the character's quircks (on exhibition throughout the first year) have been worked out and the writing took a QUANTUM LEAP in quality (hint:it was great during the first year) and most of my favorite episodes are here. Unlike the first year that was basically devoted to stories about the family and their dilema's these episodes involve alot of the supporting charaters.

  This is all the year Simpson mania hit-the year the Bart T-shirts got huge and the year 'The Simpsons Sing The Blues' album came out and the 'Do The Bartman' and all that! Can I pick a favorite from this season?Nope-everything on all four disks are a pure masterstroke for the series. For a bonus the hilerious music video to 'Do The Bartman' is here (I remember THAT one) and Bart's 'appearance' on the 1990 American Music Awards. A must have for Simpson nuts everywhere. I suggest you get yourself a groove in your couch,get out the Duff beer and some heavily salted snack treats from your local Quicky Mart and enjoy!",1098921600,,1057,4.672043010752688
1690008,5,B000063EME,The simpsons season two is even longer and better than the first. This DVD contains 22 episodes and again like in the first lots of extras and eggs. The selection screens are definitly better than in the first. The simpsons make another great season. I recommend fans to buy this DVD but not from Amazon because you can find it for less somewhere else. Another great simpsons season you can add to your collection. In other words go buy it now!,1093305600,2,444,4.493827160493828

Even the new episodes, (e.g. ""The Regina Monologues"") where the Simpsons keep on saying, ""MacBeth,"" and Ian McKellen, better known as Gandalf in LOTR.  Like where Lisa says, ""Good luck, Ian,"" and McKellen says, ""It's bad luck to say that, too,"" and gets struck by lightning.  Makes me laugh.  But these are classics.

1690012,4,B000063EME,"Every year when those Simpsons seasons comes out on DVD we would buy them right away and I'm glad that they're finally doing so cause I'm a fan of the older episodes and I don't really care for the newer episodes, I think that the best seasons for the Simpsons are 1-5, 6-8 were good but I was starting to lose interest in them by that time and I pretty much gave up watching the Simpsons afterwards, I only consider myself a casual Simpsons fan but I know what's a good episode when I see it and the only thing what I don't like about the DVD is the annoying menu system where you have to put the heads on the right person and I don't like the idea that you have to go back to the menu just to keep playing the episodes (they improved on that on the next season thank goodness).
My favorite episodes are Bart the Daredevil, Itchy and Scratchy and Marge, Bart Gets an F and War of the Simpsons, those are classic episodes and most of the other episodes are good, if you're new to the Simpsons, I would rather get the DVD's instead of watching them on Sunday nights cause they're not what they used to be and it seems to be that they're running out of ideas and one thing what I like about the extra features is the two videos of the Simpsons, Do the Bartman and Deep Deep Trouble.",1086825600,,1280,4.144578313253012

The real Simpsons hype began during this season. I love the episode ""The Way We Was"" , the only dissapointment in this was ""The Raven"" stoy in ""TTHOH"" ( i hope u know what i mean). So yeah I love this season as much as any other well not really, but it is one grood season!

1690017,4,B000063EME,"I love this set and watch it basically daily--the quality of the episodes and the special features are great.  However, the one thing that drives me up the wall about the set is that you have to spin the characters' heads at the beginning of each disc when you first put it in, before the list of episodes comes up, which is about annoying and useless, and only fun the first time.  Other than that one little thing, it's a great set.  The episode ""Lisa's Substitute"" is my absolute favorite of all time, and that alone makes the annoying spinning worth my while!",1078444800,,563,4.446601941747573

The strange voices and slightly wrong colouring has been patched up since the first season and comes to represent the Simpsons we all know and love.  This season is when it starts to get really good.  Classic episodes like 'Blood Feud' (""Ok Mr Burns, whats your first name? Homer: ""I don't know..."") never fail to get a good laugh.  True Simpsons fans will get a kick out of the extra scenes that somehow got cut from the TV versions.  These extra little segments really help the characterisation and often explain a lot more.  Look for one with Mrs Krebopple and the chef in the episode where Homer goes to the Japanese restaurant... You can never go wrong with The Simpsons.

Other than the very annoying feature of spinning heads before you can easily view the DVD, this is a well done set.  If you like the Simpson's, you'll like the series.  What makes it even more worth buying is the commentary with each episode.  The commentary on the Halloween episode is hilarious.

1690022,5,B000063EME,"The Simpsons' second season continued much along the lines of the first, with mainly down-to-earth family situations, but the humor was growing more absurd, the crowd of characters growing, guest stars popping up all over the place, social commentary becoming stronger. The second season shows the Simpsons beginning to transform into what they are now, and beginning to prove that they've to stay. Some classic episodes:
`Two Cars In Every Garage And Three Eyes On Every Fish' - the episode which Harry Shearer named as his favorite makes powerful social commentary as Mr. Burns runs for governor.
`Itchy & Scratchy & Marge' - Marge starts a campaign against the violence on the Itchy & Scratchy show, and eventually becomes a writer on the show herself.
`Bart Gets Hit By A Car' - the episode introduces Lional Hutz, attorney at law, and features the classic trial scene.
`The Way We Was' - the first of many nostalgia episodes for the Simpsons, this classic tells of the beginning of Homer and Marge's love life.
`Three Men And A Comic Book' - Bart, Milhouse and Martin buy a rare and precious issue of Radioactive Man, and consequently start quarrelling over it. First appearance of the still unnamed Comic Book Guy.
`Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?' - features Danny DeVito as Homer's half-brother Herb Powell.
`Homer vs. Lisa And The Tenth Commandment' - Lisa is concerned about the family's illegal cable hook-up being a one-way ticket to hell.
And finally - `Threehouse Of Horror', the first in a series of glorious Halloween specials that became a tradition. This first contains three classic spook stories, all of which are graced with the presence of guest star James Earl Jones's booming bass voice - `Bad Dream House', `Hungry Are The Damned' (the first appearance of aliens Kang and Kodos, and a clever parody of the `Twilight Zone' episode `To Serve Men'), and of course Sam Simon's classic adaptation of Poe's `The Raven' (one of my favorite moments in Simpson history is Bart as the Raven screaming `Eat My Shorts' instead of `Nevermore').
For the Simpson fan - the second season is essential; it contains some classic and unforgettable episodes and is well worth adding to your collection. Highly recommended DVD.",1064361600,2,2227,4.957219251336898

Bart The Daredevil had a scene from the end completely cut (where Homer falls down the gorge while strapped to a gurney).  Itchy & Scratchy & Marge sinks to even lower depths - for one thing the original reporter on ""Smartline"" (who resembles a popular on-air personality) was replaced with very poorly rendered Kent Brockman - and Krusty and Marge's scenes on ""Smartline"" were altered.

The reason I say this is because the second season of the Simpsons is a perfect example of the show's greatest humor at its peak.
This collection features all the classic Simpsons episodes, including my all-time favorite, ""Bart's Dog Gets and F,"" where Santa's Little Helper (Bart's dog) goes to obedience school and is nearly too stupid to pass. The family faces many follies along the way. Just watch the episode, you'll then know what I mean.

1690039,5,B000063EME,"Alright, I will admit the title of this review is a bit presumptuous.  However, after watching the episodes in the DVD set, viewers will all agree that any collection of Simpsons episodes can not be given less than five stars.
You may ask, ""Why is this?""  And that is a good question.
Season II has many classic episodes which really have defined the show.
There is ""Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish"" which works very well at exposing the character of Mr. Burns.
Also, the past of Marge and Homer is revealed in ""The Way We Was"".
This season was also the beginning of the yearly ""Treehouse of Horror"".  Most notable in this episode is probably the very well-done parody of Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Raven"".
Even in its early years (the Second Season, in this case), the episodes of the show are filled with multiple levels of humor.  Actually, these older episodes are a breath of fresh air compared to some (not all) of the jokes from the newest episodes.  You find more often in these episodes jokes which span all generations because they are so well written.
Finally, each episode has moments which are classic and memorable simply because they occured so early in the show's history.  These are the great memories from ""The Simpsons"" because they are our first memories.  If you haven't seen these episodes, I suggest that you do, so you may have these memories too.  For those of you who have seen Season II, I suggest that you buy it, for who doesn't want to remember these classic episodes?",1050105600,5,1516,4.588888888888889

1690041,5,B000063EME,"There are many other excellent episode by episode summaries here already, so I won't go down that road.  I simply want to add my support for these episodes.
The first season of the Simpsons was, of course, very, very funny, but often uneven.  The characters were cruder (not just crudely drawn), and hadn't yet found the balance of slapstick and sentimentality that became the hallmark of the show.  I highly recommend season one (it's still better than 99% of anything else out there), but with season two, the show begins quite strongly to demonstrate that it can and will dish out ALL kinds of humor, often within one scene (or one line!). You get satire, irony, slapstick, farce, romantic comedy, verbal humor, scatalogical humor, and more.  The Simpsons began to show on a regular basis that animation could cross more lines and chop down more icons per minute than any other medium.  The creators really began to take advantage of the freedom they had.
And quite simply, it's just so .... funny!  What more, really, do you need.  Isn't one laugh every 10 seconds enough reason?!
If you can only afford one DVD box set, get this one.  It'll entertain you and your friends for years!!",1049328000,2,1188,4.733009708737864

1690043,5,B000063EME,"The program review-- The second season of the Simpsons, is not the best season, but certainly is better than the first season and MUCH better than any Simpsons' season after the 8th season.
Like the first season, you can see the social sarcasm about the ""American Way-of-Life""; in this season, you can see a better character development than the fisrt, for example, in this season appears a ""Not so stupid"" Homer (and i like this Homer more than the Today Homer), Marge is, well, the same Marge, Lisa became the most deep character of all the family, Bart is the same Bart (but who would want to see him changed??).
Here you find a bunch of great stories and a better animation than the first season.
The DVD review-- I recommend the Season Set in region 4 over the region 1, because the region 4 have everything from the region 1 (except perhaps the little booklet), plus the Spanish and Portuguesse audio track, then if you like the Mexican-Spanish version of the Simpsons, then buy it in Region 4.
I would like that in this collection appeared the ""Intel"" commercial, but i guess the Fox guys are keeping it for another season set.

Especially here in the second season -  as the writers, actors, animators and directors get comfortable with how to put together a good, consistent product every week  - it's great to hear them comment on the shows as you watch.
Each episode typically has the lead writer, director, and Matt Groenig sitting in to comment. You'll hear plenty of stories about difficulties that the Simpsons had in their first years, with Fox's censors, a new time slot (opposite Cosby), etc.
The comments include jokes that didn't make it (many deservedly), plus interesting facts on the way the show's characters came into being (did you know that Dr. Julius Hibbert was a tribute to ""Saturday Night Live"" actress Julia Sweeny?)..

This being season two, the quality of the episodes are a lot better. Not only are the jokes and the animation better, but the stories also make more sense this time around (In season one, we saw Homer attempt suicide, Marge get drunk, and Homer sell his TV to a pawn shop so he could afford family therapy.) A lot of now-classic Simpsons episodes are contained within this boxed set. There are 22 episodes in all and included with the four discs is a guide to all the episodes, which states when each episode first aired, gives a synopsis for each episode and gives random facts about each individual episode. I thought being able to watch all 22 episodes was going to be enough to contain me, until I uncovered the commentary. Talk about entertainment! Listening to the commentary just enhances the experience. Matt Groening is present on each episode commentary, as are major Simpsons players like Al Jean and James L. Brooks (who are funny enough without their nasal nerdy voices). Some of the stuff they talk about is actually funnier than what is being played onscreen. Even though I have listened to all the commentaries more than once, I keep coming back for more because they are just so hilarious, fun and entertaining. The extras are also nice and a little weird at the same time. Weird doesn't even begin to describe the American Music Awards segment that appears on the extras (just listen to the commentary on THAT one!). All in all, I don't know why I keep seeing people give these box-sets negative reviews. I feel that I definetly got the most for my money. Out of all the DVD's I own, The Simpsons seasons one & two are the crown jewels. If you are a fan of the series or were a fan of the series, you owe it to yourself to invest your money into this set.

1690071,4,B000063EME,"While the first season contained funny moments, there really weren't any shows that stand up to repeated viewings over and over again. The second season shows are denser, much funnier, and occasionally touching. The sly pop-culture references are much more accessible than they have become in the most recent shows, and the episodes are also more coherent. For my money, Seasons 3-8 are the best, but season 2 is approaching greatness.
Personal highlights of this package include (in order of appearance):
1. Simpson and Delilah - where Homer bilks the company med plan for hair-growth drugs, and is promoted to manager. Homer's secretary (the ""other"" Carl) is fantastic.
2. Three Eyes on Every Fish - the Simpson's first extended ripoff of Citizen Kane (I thought the episode should be called Citizen Burns), where Mr. Burns runs for governor. Also the first episode to centre on a non-Simpson.
3. The Way We Was - the first flashback episode, now legendary and oft-repeated. Marge and Homer's first date, and an appearance by John Lovitz as Marge's other prom date.
4. Homer vs. the Eighth Commandment - Homer steals cable TV and Lisa attempts to guilt him out of it.
5. Oh Brother Where Art Thou - starring Danny Devito as Homer's long-lost 1/2 brother, and owner of Powell Motor Company.
6. Lisa's Substitute - probably the most touching of all Simpsons episodes, ever. Lisa's crush on her substitute teacher, starring Dustin Hoffman (although under a pseudonym).
There are many, many other high points and first appearances of characters we come to know and love throughout the succeeding seasons. And all the stories are presented without ads and without edits - there are many scenes I've never seen before, having only seen these episodes in reruns (Fox was not available on my local cable system until Season 3). There are still a few growing pains - Carl has Lennie's voice in one mid-season episode, and Mr. Burns' voice and animation varies randomly throughout. However, they are minor flaws, and the animation and characters have mostly settled into the forms we've come to recognise and love.
The extras are enjoyable, especially the inclusion of ""The Bartman"" video and some interviews with Matt Groenig and others recorded as 2nd-season publicity material. Painful to watch is a pregnant Nancy Cartwright dressed in a Bart suit handing out an award at the American Music Awards. Finally, there's the commentaries, which are not nearly as useful or interesting as those on the 1st season disc, but there are some interesting tidbits, and by the time you've gone through 24 shows (plus the 13 from Season 1), you feel like you are getting to know the regulars in the commentaries.
All in all, a very satisfying package, especially for the low price! At a time when many shows are costing over $100 for a season, the show that Time Magazine dubbed the Best of the Century is offering great deals on its complete Season 2 set.",1035158400,5,2938,4.913480885311872

You will have seen all the episodes plenty of times over the past 10 years, and the extra footage of Butterfingers ads and Emmy awards is fairly pointless, and 'Do The Bartman' is still too embarrassing to be cool in a retro styleee, but don't let that put you off.
The DVD is invaluable for the commentary featuring Matt Groening and the writers and director for each episode.  Here you'll find out more about in jokes and will soon build up a stronger picture of all the movie references you've previously spotted.  You'll also learn more about the tiny guest spots that were not heavily publicised.
As an extra bonus for viewers who have only ever seen The Simpsons on US TV you get access to many of the 'Euro-minutes' that you've previously missed out on in favour of extra commercials.  The commentary sheds light on much of the product development that was still going on at that time, reminding you of many of the changes in style over the years.

Now, more than ten years after the original broadcasts, the shows of the Simpsons' second season are made whole again.
More than whole, actually. Every episode has an audio commentary track with Matt Groening and some of the other creators of the series. They explain some of the more esoteric jokes, and point out funny signs as the camera sweeps past them. They tell about the Fox network's decision to schedule The Simpsons opposite Bill Cosby's hit sitcom. Some tales are told more than once. Sometimes everyone just sits and laughs at comedy bits they created more than a decade ago. They're having fun, and it's catching.
This DVD collection also pulls together ephemera that might otherwise have been lost forever: the Simpsons as presenters at the Emmy Awards; a foam-rubber Bart at the American Music Awards; music videos, Butterfinger commercials, and more.

No. 2-  I like everyone else was disappointed to see edits from the original shows.  It is cool to see some new scenes as well though, which aren't normally on the TV versions.
I think the special features were adequate.  After all, they have to save some for the next 12 seasons.  Commentaries were adequate, but Season 1s were better.

As many reviewers have already outlined the episodes, the bonus  features, and the advantages of owning the DVD, I should probably point out the reasons not to have it.
- The increased DVD picture quality is not essential to watching The Simpsons. The drawings were still slightly crude during the 2nd season (this is not exactly Akira).
- Wherever you live, it is highly likely Simpsons episodes are being rerun/rebroadcast, and hence you're likely to catch the same episodes on TV.
- ""Do The Bartman"" wasn't funny then, and isn't now.
- You and all your friends have seen these episodes numerous times, and use Simpsons quotes in everyday life.
- Is it really necessary to know every little Simpson's fact?

This DVD will not let you stop laughing. The episode ""Dancing Homer"" is a classic, along with ""Bart gets an F."" This DVD takes you back to the second season, where Homer's voice is made-over to be the Homerific voice you know and love. This season also was really edgy especially with some of the role-players like Lenny. I am hooked on this series, and will buy the Third Season as soon as it comes out.

1690087,4,B000063EME,"Everyone knows how the program improved from the first season to the second, so I will spare you the episode reviews that are so ubiquitous on this page.  What is important, however, is that the presentation of these great episodes has gotten better.
In terms of sound and picture quality, there is no question that these are great (as were the first season DVDs).  The packaging is nearly the same, and it certainly looks handsome to have the two as-of-yet-released seasons sitting near each other on my shelf.
As for improvements: The bonus features on this set are, on the whole, better than the first installment of this series.  Especially good were the short films originally distributed as FOX promotional material: interviews with James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, and footage describing the creating of an episode were definite assets.  More foreign language clips were included, which is also a big plus.
A few things are a bit annoying about these discs.  For one: in order to get to the main menu, you have to wait a considerable amount of time.  Of course, I understand and accept the necessity to have a warning from the FBI and Interpol or whatever, but the animation game that requires you to press enter in order to put the characters' heads on their corresponding bodies is irksome--especially since you have to do it three times.  It's cute, but a bit overdone.  Also (and this is a very slight complaint), when I'm looking for a particular episode, I don't like having to refer to the included booklet (or having to pick a disc at random).  Perhaps the main menu on Disc 1 could include a list of all episodes and, when chosen, they could direct the viewer to insert the appropriate disc.  Or, if it wouldn't be too unattractive (or not keeping with the already-released installments), it would be nice to have episode titles written on the discs themselves, or at least in a promiment place on the interior packaging.
All in all, this DVD set is a must have for all Simpsons fans.  I just hope the sets continue to improve with each installment--Lord knows Fox is taking enough time between release dates.  They might as well make them good.",1031184000,,2160,4.730666666666667
1690088,5,B000063EME,"This is a subjective opinion, I realize, but I'm not alone in stating it: ""The Simpsons"" is the best television show of all time. Consistently witty, innovatively animated (just watch Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network and marvel at all the imitators of the animation style), and subversively satirical, the show would already be a top contender without the genuine emotional core the show provides. That, and it's one of the only shows I can count on to be laugh-out-loud funny (in many cases, side-splittingly funny) on a regular basis. If there's anything better than this, I can't imagine what it is.
Thankfully, FOX gave us the DVD collection such a brilliant show deserves. Just as the second season was a huge leap above the first, so is this new DVD even better than ""The Complete First Season."" There's audio commentary with Matt Groening on every episode, and it seems even funnier than the first ones. It's outstanding.
Frankly, if you don't own this by now, you need to. This is fantastic - I can't imagine being even a casual ""Simpsons"" fan and not buying this.",1030924800,3,1070,4.820652173913044

Audio commentarys are back, but, they have COOL features like the UNCUT music videos for ""Deep, Deep Trouble"" and the fondly remembered ""Do the Bartman"". Plus, this is when the show got good, Homer's voice was not bizzare and they went out of doing lame Bart stories! All 22 episodes are there, for example, ""Bart Gets an F"" (the one that started all the school-banning t-shirts), ""Three Men and a Comic Book"" (a funny one), ""Bart the Daredevil"" (c'mon, the one with Homer falling off a cliff twice!) and ""Treehouse of Horror"" (The trilogy episode that started it all: The Simpsons Halloween Episodes). The only thing that decreased this to four stars is a really annyoing thing: When you put one of the discs on, it takes forever to get to the actual DVD. THEN, you have to press ""Enter"" (or the ""X"" button on PS2s) three times to get the characters bodies right! It is truely idiotic.

Among my favorites are ""Bart Gets An F"", ""Bart's Dog Gets An F"", ""Itchy & Scratchy & Marge"", ""The Way We Was"", ""Old Money"", ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", and ""Principle Charming"". These are classic, must have Simpsons episodes. I have been watching since I was 4-5, and now, finally this great show is available to own on DVD. You get well worth your money, in fact, this set could be worth 40 bucks, I'd pay it! It's a whole season that made television history. America's favorite family came into their own with this season. This is the season that made America fall in love with the Simpsons. As bonus features go, I rate this DVD 5 stars. You get two Bart Simpson music video: ""Deep, Deep Trouble"" (such a good song!!) & ""Do The Bartman"" (my favorite of the two). These are great!! Also, the Emmy Awards presenation is halarious, and the interview with the creators of the show is very informative as well as the commentary on every episode and the featurette on the making of an episode. You also get a photo gallery with great photos and magazine covers around the time of the second season. Also hidden among the menus of this set are several Easter Eggs (or hidden bonus features). The hidden features are sketches & one storyboard of a deleted scene in ""Bart Gets An F"". All in all, this is what makes having a DVD player even more fun & entertaining. Not only does ""The Simpsons"" make you laugh, it can make you sad too. This is not just a cartoon, this is ""The Simpsons"".

1690094,5,B000063EME,"I seem to be in the minority, but I think the first 3 Simpsons seasons were fantastic, and then did a long steady decline.  The last couple of seasons are almost unwatchable.  It seems people are sharply divided on this.  Those who watched the season from the beginning prefer the earlier episodes, and those who started watching in the mid 90s like the later stuff.  Anyway...
I mainly wanted to comment on the false reports of editing in the ""Bart the Daredevil"" episode.  The extended scene of Homer falling down the cliff the second time was NOT in the original broadcast.  I know, because I have the episode on tape from it's debut broadcast.
The extra footage was added later, for a clip show retrospective.  My guess is that the ""2nd time falling down the cliff"" footage was fully animated and intended to be used for the original episode, but was cut for time.  (Or perhaps because of a squeamish censor?).  It wound up being added later for the clip show, and that is what most people seem to remember.  Since the extended scene wasn't in the original episode when it aired, it doesn't belong on the DVD.

I bought the first season and was thrilled. Now I purchased the second season and was delighted again, but extremely disappointed.
I went to watch one of my favorite episodes, Bart the Daredevil, and was shocked to find that it had been edited.  They cut the best scene in the episode where after crashing in the ambulance Homer falls back into the gorge wrapped in bandages, IV bag flying and the gurney tumbles after.  This was a crucial scene and the fact that they cut it from the ""complete"" second season is a major let down for any true Simpsons fan.  But you be the judge.
It is worth every penny to have crystal clear picture and awesome sound, but what is the point of editing the most humorous scenes?",1030147200,2,867,4.327160493827161
1690097,4,B000063EME,"There's really not a whole lot to say about this DVD collection; there are plenty of episode guides already out there (I particularly recommend the ""Simpsons Forever"" series) so there's not much point in me rehashing on an episode-by-episode basis.  Suffice it to say that this set includes all of the shows from season two of The Simpsons, as well as a few ""extras"".  I put the extras in quotes, because they are a bonus in name only; like its predecessor, this disc has no particularly interesting special features.
In fact, the so-called extras consist of a few Butterfinger commercials, some embarrassingly bad footage of the Bartman video, and a hodge-podge of old promotional materials.  There are also ""director commentaries, but a significant portion of those tracks are taken up by Matt Groening et al either a. laughing, or b. quietly enjoying their work.
Ultimately, what this set comes down to is the episodes.  They look and sound fantastic, and they contain a lot of material that hasn't shown up in syndication for years.  The series really hit its stride in the second season: the characters are more clearly defined and start to sound ""normal"", the animation improves drastically, and the humor becomes much more sophisticated.  For these reasons alone, the set is more than worth owning, especially to a die-hard fan.  But the fact of the matter is that Fox has been incredibly lazy about assembling these compendiums; considering the overwhelming lack of additional features, there's no reason why they shouldn't have twice as many seasons out by now.  I think most fans would be more than happy to buy each season without any extra features, and pay a little less, especially considering the extras are pretty lame to begin with.
To conlude: buy this because you love The Simpons, not because you are a DVD aficionado who loves special features.

""The Complete Second Season"" is a great example, collecting 22 classic Simpsons episodes and a generous helping of extra material on a mere four discs.  The show has long since lapsed into a comfortable and endlessly repeated formula, but in 1990-91 when these shows were first broadcast, they were considered so controversial and subversive that President George Bush (senior) publicly berated it (to which Bart gave an absolutely hilarious response in the introduction to a susequent episode).  Nothing was sacred on those original shows, particularly hypocritical politicians.
Many of the best Simpson's episodes ever are collected here, from the first Halloween special to Marge's war on Itchy and Scratchy to Mr. Burns running for governor to the flashback episode showing how Marge and Homer met.  Included among the extras are the videos for the songs ""Do the Bartman"" and ""Deep Deep Trouble"" from ""The Simpsons Sing the Blues"" as well as the Bart Simpson Butterfing commercials.  There is also plenty of commentary from the creators of the show.
Overall, a fantastic collection of classic Simpsons that is a must have for any fan of the show.",1029542400,2,1270,5.086538461538462
1690109,5,B000063EME,"COOL! (Name the character and episode of that hysterical line.) Plenty has been said about the technical aspects of this DVD set, both good and bad. Personally I find the color and focus suspect. But all hardcore Simpsons fanatics should let these limitations slide because you may not be seeing the forest for the trees. Here we have the full second season of the Simpsons, and this was the season when the show really took off. Of course during the first season the Simpsons, and especially Bart, became a cultural phenomenon. But the show itself was still developing, with the animators and voice actors still ironing out the kinks of the classic Simpsons style. In this second season, not only are the animation and voices solidified, but you can see the writing and characterizations getting better with each passing episode. Bart was moving into a more complex and subversive brand of hell-raising, the true depths of Lisa's strange intelligence were coming to the fore, and Homer most of all was becoming deeper and more quotable. Also notice that this season was when Homer started to surpass Bart as the true star of the series. The second season gave us great classic episodes like ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" (first appearance of Unky Herb), and the politically subversive ""Itchy & Scratchy & Marge."" A surprising amount of emotional power, which would later become standard for the show, is revealed in ""Bart Gets an F"" where Bart shows true vulnerability, and ""Lisa's Substitute"" in which we start to plumb the depths of Lisa's character.
Some editing seems to have taken place with these episodes, showing that we are watching post-syndication versions. The most blatant example is the deletion of a scene from ""Bart the Daredevil"" - that being the second time Homer falls down Springfield Gorge. This may be anathema to superfanatics. The DVD extras still contain a few throwaways but are generally better than the first season package. Included are the two videos from the ""Simpsons Sing the Blues"" album, which are reminders of what a huge cultural phenomenon the Simpsons were back at the beginning of the 90's. The best bonus offering is an interview with Matt Groening in which he describes the inspirations for the characters and the philosophy behind the show.",1029456000,10,2282,4.960835509138382
1690110,5,B000063EME,"I am a major Simpsons fan.  I grew up on the Simpsons.  I would highly recommend you getting this box set insted of Season 1.  The first season box set was primative and not the most fun to watch.  The second season is when the Simpsons become what they are today.  If you are undecided on the first or second season, GO WITH THE 2ND SEASON! Also, this DVD set contains scenes that were cut out before air on TV, some of them extremely funny!",1029456000,,442,4.152941176470589
1690111,4,B000063EME,"The second season of The Simpsons began at the peak of Simpsons-mania, when t-shirts, key chains, stickers, note pads, buttons, figures, and the infamous bootleg Simpsons t-shirts were selling in large quantities everywhere. Fox took the step of moving the show to Thursday nights at 8 p.m., creating a showdown of sorts with The Cosby Show.
Most people's favorite episodes aired during this season, among them ""Treehouse of Horror"" (the first Halloween episode), ""Bart the Daredevil"", ""Lisa's Substitute"", and ""Three Men and a Comic Book"". So, there's really not a duff episode to be found in this set.
This DVD set of the second season improves on the first. Matt Groening provides audio commentary for all 22 episodes, for one thing. There are a few more extras - two music videos, and clips from the Emmy Awards and the American Music Awards, for example - since there was more ""extra"" type stuff available.
A couple of complaints about the authoring/design, however. First, the animated tricks before you get to the menus are only clever the first time around; it's annoying to not be able to access the menus directly. Second, there seems to be no option that allows you to watch all of the episodes on a disc back-to-back; you must go through the menus (the main menu, plus a separate menu for each episode) every time you want to watch a different episode. And easter eggs are no longer cool. Who wants to spend [money] to have to go looking for stuff that may or may not be there? If you can't be bothered to put it on the menu, leave it out, please.
That aside, this is an essential item for Simpsons fans. Naturally, there will be some duplication if you own any of the VHS releases (or if you've been diligently taping every episode as it airs), but the quality is worth the extra bucks.",1029369600,2,1799,4.660377358490566
1690112,4,B000063EME,"After getting off to a hilarious, but still technically crude start, season 2 found the Simpsons starting to hit their stride. Bart and company were all over the stores and Simpson-Mania had begun. Now it's a given that the Simpsons are popular, but back then, they were still finding their voice. Many familiar characters were introduced, and the first ""Treehouse of Horror"" appeared, marking one of the great running series within the Simpsons that continues to this day.
Technically, the artwork improved and smoothed, and our characters moved a lot closer to their final form that we know and love. Being a guest voice started to become a status symbol for some celebrities. And these episodes are restored to all their glory -none of the cuts we see for syndication today.
To me one of the gems are the two music videos ""Deep Deep Trouble"" and ""Do the Bartman."" These examples help show the branching out of the Simpsons into other areas - here putting out a musical album. I had not seen these in years and it really pulled me back. Just like the old time animated short subjects, it's amazing how much the animators could pack into a simple few minutes of cartoon.
Just a glorious treatment for one of the best shows on TV. Let's get some more of the seasons out!",1029283200,2,1270,4.648888888888889
1690113,5,B000063EME,"Both the DVD and this season is excellent. Its embarassing how much I love and watch the Simpson's and this DVD just puts me a in a state of bliss...as stupid as that may seem. The second season is where Springfield and the characters are starting to flesh out more and of course this season is more hilarious than the first. The characters and their catch phrases introduced in this season are numerous including: Nelson's ""Ha-ha"", Professor Frink, Hans Moleman, Mayor Quimby, Lionel Hutz, and Groundskeeper Willie among others I may be forgetting. I believe this season probably could have either made or broke the Simpsons but the animation, story, and humor bounded ahead in this great season. This season has some of my personal favorites such as: ""The Way We Was"", ""Dead Putting Society"", and ""Bart Gets an F"". This Season has a profusion of guest voice appearances also, including: Dustin Hoffman (uncredited yet suprising), James Earl Jones, Danny Devito, and Tracey Ulman.
As for the quality of DVD, it has also got better since the first season. Although the matching up head to body thing at the begining of the DVD's can be alittle annoying (as some reviewers have already pointed out)it doesn't take away from the DVD all that much. It is also great to see these shows uncut after having to watch them chopped up in syndication for so long. The commentaries, as ussual, are funny and informative, The commentary for ""Dead Putting Society"" is especially funny. All the extra features are great as well.
If you want to own the begining of a great show this is the season to buy. I grew up watching the Simpsons and this DVD brings back fond memories. I can't wait till the 3rd and 4th seasons comes out (my all-time favorite seasons).",1029283200,,1745,4.743421052631579

1690116,5,B000063EME,"The Simpsons Second Season is one of my top favourite seasons. The characters are more developed than season one, and the satire and witty humor hues closer to the Simpsons that fans have all come to know and love. This season is by far better than any other season, except perhaps season five. Some of my favorite episodes in this season are ""Simpson and Delilah"", in which Homer grows hair and is promoted by Mr. Burns, a romantic and relatable reminiscence of how Homer and Marge met and fell in love in ""The Way We Was""; Mr. Burns has hypohemia and recieves a blood transfusion in ""Blood Feude"", and also, in ""Bart Vs. Thanksgiving"", Bart learns a good lesson about remorse and family love. As for the extra bonus features, they're much better than The Simpsons complete season one DVD. This DVD includes classic music videos ""Deep, Deep Trouble"" and ""Do the Bartman"", the Simpsons presenting Emmy awards, an interview with creators of the Simpsons, the making of animation, and more! So, if you're a true Simpsons fan, this would be a great DVD to buy! :)",1029196800,,1060,4.67379679144385
1690117,5,B000063EME,"Okay, that was a terrible title for this review. Fortunately, the same can't be said about this spiffy, super-deluxe DVD set. It's called ""The Simpsons- The Complete Second Season,"" and that's what it is. But there's more!

The second season consists of 22 brilliant episodes. This is the real thing, when the show began to gel, but before so many episodes centered on yet another whacky occupation for Homer. Sure, you get to see Home-boy as a baseball team mascot in ""Dancin' Homer,"" but the other family members get spotlight time, too. Marge takes on cartoon violence in ""Itchy & Scratchy & Marge,"" Lisa gets her most poignant storyline in ""Lisa's Substitute"" (heartfelt, and with excellent guest vocals by Dustin Hoffman, plus a hilarious B-story featuring Bart), and Bart battles his friends and the darker side of comic collecting in ""Three Men and a Comic Book.""

This is your chance to own a full 22-episode season. Your opportunity to learn Mr. Burns' full name, to feel superior to your peers as you recognize sequences lifted from classic movies (""Psycho"" and ""Citizen Kane"" come to mind). You'll gasp as Homer displays shockingly drunken behavior at a party, belch as you enjoy a giant tub of Duff beer during ""Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night,"" then tremble as Bart and Lisa trade horror stories up in the treehouse. Plus, you get episodes featuring Ringo Starr and Phil Hartman, Danny DeVito, George Takei, Tracey Ullmann, and Larry King.

Like the ""Season One"" set, you also get a Springfield-sized load of extras. The commentary alone would be enough, but you also get music videos (did anyone actually DO ""The Bartman?""), Simpsons appearances outside the show (commercials and award ceremonies), a documentary on how a show is made, and interviews. The only negative is the annoying animated menu where you'll have to swap everyone's heads a three times before you're allowed to get on with the show.  You can avoid this by pressing ""menu,"" but that's documented nowhere on the DVD itself.

But that's a minor glitch in a top-notch set. Each episode is beautifully presented, looking better than they did when originally aired. And minus the commercials. For a Simpsons fan, this is definitely the ultimate (so far!) need-to-own item. This is one of tv's greatest shows, on the cusp of gaining its full satirical powers, and I can't recommend this set highly enough!",1029196800,,2423,4.972839506172839

All the episodes from season 2 are here in their original form, meaning they have extra scenes that were cut for syndication.  The video and audio are outstanding, as one would expect from DVD.  In addition to the episodes, there are a bunch of special features and clips, including music videos, an interview with James L. Brooks and Matt Groening, and the Simpsons Emmy appearance.  Better still, each episode has additional audio tracks, including commentary by the directors, writers, Groening, and other Simpsons honchos.  I bought the set for the episodes, but the commentary tracks are interesting enough to warrant occasional viewing.
Season 2 has the greatest number of the definitive Simpsons episodes: Treehouse of Horror, Bart Gets Hit by a Car, Oh Brother Where Art Thou, Three Men and a Comic Book...  the list goes on and on.  These are the first episodes for Lionel Hutz, Dr. Nick Riviera, the comic book store guy... it doesnt get much better.

1690122,4,B000063EME,"As a huge fan of the Simpsons, I bought the first and second season DVD sets more out of duty than desire. Season Two was a huge improvement upon Season One--there are more episodes, the animation is greatly improved and the show begins to take on the satirical attitude that we have all come to love--but in my opinion, the best episodes start to come in Season Three. If I were to compile a list of my top twenty favorite Simpsons episodes, not a single one on the list would be from the first two seasons.
As far as the quality of the DVD set goes, I felt it could have been better. There are a few special features--episodes commentaries, magazine covers, Butterfinger commercials, music videos of ""Deep, Deep Trouble"" and ""Do the Bartman""--but I thought we were supposed to be getting more Tracy Ulman shorts. These mini-episodes are how the Simpsons began and I was under the impression that each DVD set would contain at least one of these, so I was disappointed that this was not an included special feature. Another negative to the DVD set is that in order to get to the episode menu, you have to do this spin-the-wheel thing three times to match up the heads on the outside with the bodies on the inside. It can be kind of funny at first, but when you have to do it every single time, it gets annoying. Aside from these negatives, the DVD set is pretty nice. You get to see the episodes in the original form, including the entire opening credits sequence and segments of most shows that were lost in syndication. Plus there is the obvious benefit of not have to sit through commercials.
Here is a list of each episode from Season Two with a brief synopsis:
1) Bart Gets an F: Bart needs to pass a history test in order to avoid repeating the 4th grade
2) Simpson and Delilah: Homer gets promoted because of his new head of hair gained by charging a hair growth formula to his company health insurance
3) Treehouse of Horror: this first trilogy of Halloween stories started the annual Simpsons tradition. In ""Bad Dream House,"" the Simpsons buy a possessed house. In ""Hungry Are the Damned,"" the Simpsons are abducted by aliens. The third segment is a satire of Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Raven"" where Homer is tormented by a raven resembling Bart.
4) Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish: Burns runs for governor in order to change safety regulations so he does not have to spend millions of dollars bringing the power plant up to code
5) Dancin' Homer: Homer gets a job as the mascot for Springfield's minor league baseball team
6) Dead Putting Society: When Bart and Todd Flanders enter a mini-golf competition, Homer and Ned make a wager on whose son will win
7) Bart vs. Thanksgiving: Bart gets sent to his room after destroying Lisa's Thanksgiving centerpiece so he runs away from home
8) Bart the Daredevil: inspired by a daredevil stunt show, Bart decides to jump the Springfield Gorge on his skateboard
9) Itchy & Scratchy & Marge: when Maggie clubs Homer on the head with a mallet, Marge tries to rid cartoons of violence.
10) Bart Gets Hit by a Car: Homer tries to sue Burns for a million dollars after Bart gets hit by Burns' car
11) One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish: Homer is told that he ate a poisonous fish at a Japanese restaurant and that he has 24 hours to live
12) The Way We Was: after the TV breaks, Homer and Marge tell the story of how they met
13) Homer vs. Lisa and the Eighth Commandment: Homer gets an illegal cable hookup, but Lisa tries to convince him to stop using it after she goes to Sunday School and is told that people who break the Ten Commandments go to hell
14) Principal Charming: Homer invites Principal Skinner over as a date for Marge's sister Selma, but he falls in love with Patty, Selma's twin sister, instead
15) Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?: Homer finds his long-lost illegimate half-brother, who owns a car company and hires Homer to design a car for the common man
16) Bart's Dog Gets an F: Santa's Little Helper gets sent to obedience school after causing problems around the house
17) Old Money: Abe Simpson falls in love with a resident at the retirement home, but she dies shortly after and leaves him all her money
18) Brush With Greatness: Burns hires aspiring artist Marge to paint a portrait of him for the dedication of a new wing at the museum
19) Lisa's Substitute: Lisa develops a crush on her substitute teacher; Bart runs for class president
20) The War of the Simpsons: Marge signs up for a marriage retreat after Homer gets drunk at their dinner party
21) Three Men and a Comic Book: Bart, Milhouse and Martin pool their money to buy the first Radioactive Man comic book.
22) Blood Feud: Homer expects a monetary gift of thanks when Bart saves Burns' life by donating his rare blood.
Those are the episodes from Season Two. The characters are more developed and the episodes are more amusing than Season One, but I am patiently waiting for the later seasons to be released so that I can finally have my favorite episodes on DVD.",1029024000,5,5022,4.501642935377875

My one and only complaint is the need to press the select button three times (until spinning heads line up to their corresponding bodies) each time you put the DVD in for the first time.

By the way, if you think you've seen them all, and can just see the shows in syndication, you need to realize that the shows are up to two minutes shorter in syndication.  They cut them up to fit in more commercials.  (Damn FOX affiliates!)  For example, when Homer asked his brain to help him get Marge to forgive him, his brain responded ""eat the pudding, eat the pudding, eat the pudding, eat the pudding"" because there was a bowl of pudding in front of him.  Homer agreed, but told his brain that after that, they had to get to work.  That whole sequence is gone when I see that episode in syndication.  It's just sad.  Maybe if the people who cut up the episodes had a sense of humor....
Here are the episodes and a quick hit of the first thing I remember about each one:
Bart Gets an F-  John Hancock ""writes"" his name in the snow.
Simpson and Delilah - We find out that family doctor Hibbert is perfectly willing to cheat the health insurance company.  A very early shot at the medical profession, which The Simpsons repeatedly smacked around for years.
Tree House of Horror- In the first appearance of the Kang and Kodos, the tractor beam they use to lift Homer into the spaceship isn't strong enough for his 239 pounds so they need to use two.  Once they have Homer off of the ground, Homer goes back to eating the hamburger he was eating before the rest of his family had been abducted by the aliens.
Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish - See Blinky!  See the epsisode which inspired billionaire Mike Bloomberg to run for Mayor of New York City!
Dancin' Homer -  Homer orders a beer the size of a fish tank and then he and Mr. Burns taunt the minor league ballplayers.
Dead Putting Society - Lots of good Flanders bashing from Homer in this one.  If you can't stand Charlie Church, this is a good one for you.
Bart vs. Thanksgiving - After Homer unsuccessfully tries to light the fireplace, the family sits down for dinner.  Lisa's centerpiece becomes the centerpiece of a sibling rivalry fight between Lisa and Bart, and it eventually flies into the fireplace and goes up in flames.  Everyone is horrified except Grampa Simpson who comments. ""Ooh!  That got 'er going!""
Bart the Daredevil - Lance Murdoch congratulates Bart on his choice of a daredevil career.  Later, when Homer tries, and fails, to jump the Springfield Gorge, see him hit his head on many, many pointy rocks.  Thank God the ambulance showed up to ease his pain....Oh, wait...nevermind.
Marge vs. Itchy & Scratchy - Grampa Simpson takes his underware off without removing his pants.  I'm curious to hear the commentary track on this one to see if this episode was done in response to crack-pots like Marge writing in to FOX complaining about The Simpsons.
Bart Gets Hit By A Car - Dr. Nick takes a look at Bart's X-ray and says, ""Do you see this black mark that looks like my thumb-print, that's trauma"".  (What did I say about The Simpsons taking shots at the medical profession?)
One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue fish -  Fugu Me!  (This is one of my very favorite episodes.)  ""Master, we need your skilled hands in the kitchen.""  Master, ""My skilled hands are busy!""  In addition to many great moments, (like Dr. Hibbert giving Homer a pamplet titled ""So you are going to die"") this is one of those episodes where the syndication version cut out some great moments.  I'll finally get to see Homer tell-off Mr. Burns again.
The Way We Was - ""Sure, 55 miles per hour will save lives, but millions will be late!""
Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment - TV announcer doing a promotional commercial for the upcoming heavyweight fight: ""Drederick Tatum is ready after a 3 year stay Springfield Penetentiary.""  Barney Gumble [watching the commercial at Moes]:  ""Allright!  A local boy!""  (I'm not sure about the quote on the TV announcer, but that was the general idea of it.)
Principal Charming - Skinner falls for Patty when Homer was trying to set him up with Selma.  ""D'oh!!!"".
Oh Brother, Where Art Thou- Grampa Simpson, ""Ooh, I knew I kept the wrong one.""
Bart's Dog Gets an F - ""We've never had a problem with a family member we could give away before.""
Old Money - The lions in the Springfield Safari kill and eat a zebra on the hood of the Simpson's car.
Brush With Greatness- ""WooHoo!!  239 and feeling fine!!""  A personal note, in this episode Smithers brings Mr. Burns some tea, which Mr. Burns sips, says ""Bah!  Too Hot!"" and throws it on Smithers.  It is now over ten years later and every single time I eat or drink something that is too hot, I say to myself, ""Bah!  Too Hot!"".  Fortunately, I don't throw it.  Unfortunately, it is a leading indicator that I am clearly not right in the head.
Lisa's Substitute - For your information, there were lots of Jewish cowboys.
The War of the Simpsons - Mmmm...Giant Catfish.  In the early years, Marge used to worry about her relationship with Homer.  These days, she just nurtures his needs and tries to keep him from doing anything too stupid.  (Homer, why don't you start and emu farm?)
Three Men and a Comic Book- One Muttonchop Yastremski coming up.
Blood Feud- No Maggie, not Aztec.  Olmec.  O-L-M-E-C. (Hey man, don't bad mouth the head!  The head later appears in the Simpson's basement in several episodes.  God knows how they got it down there, but hey, cartoons don't have to be 100% realistic.)",1027641600,7,5629,4.512339585389931
1690146,4,B000063EME,"The Simpsons, a typical american family, an icon for america.  A family that can make cry, and to laugh the rest of the time.  The Simpsons have been able to combine The Jokes of Jay Leno of the tonight show, with a unique cartoon family in a odd little town, where who what will happen.  If you don't laugh while watching the Simpsons, I don't know what will.  Even the most avide anti-simpson fanatics would laugh at one time or another.  Even though they hate it, it can make them laugh.  The simpsons have been able to bring a country together, race doesn't matter, and nothing else does either.  The Simpsons can bring people together to laugh at societies feebles, and people can even come to laugh at them selves.  I could not imagine a world without the Simpsons.  Well, enjoy your latest Simpsons purchase, and remember, if you look at all the clues you can figure out what state the Simpsons live in.  Good Luck, And when you are laughing at one of those jokes, remember there are millions of other Simpsons fans laughing with you.

1690147,5,B000063EME,I have been a fan of The Simpsons for years now.  I have the The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD and cannot stop watching it.  It is great.  I have waited months and months for season 2 and now it is here!  I have seen every episode in season 2 and can assure you that you will never stop laughing.  Season 2 is one of the best seasons.  Buy this item and you will not regret it!,1027296000,,387,3.8974358974358974
1690148,5,B000063EME,"Today the 22nd of July 'The Simpsons: complete second season' was released in Australia, and I can tell you this box set is twice as good as the first, which was amazing. Features are top notch and the box sets are completely the same aesthetically aside from different color-coding.
The first thing that strikes you about the set is now 4 DVD's rather than the three in the first season. Each episode is digitally mastered, looking prettier than ever and the sound has been completely overhauled and mixed into an amazing Dolby digital 5.1 mix. There are 22 episodes overall, each with the fine commentary seen in the first season DVD's as well as language subtitles etc.
The features on the DVD collection are great, 2 music videos 'Do the Bartman' and 'Deep, deep trouble' as well as a series of 'making of' featurettes. Added to this are some excerpts from the Grammy awards, and American music awards presented by the Simpsons. While these are all great features they are fairly novel and really won't dictate continual watching. But that's not why you buy the set, you buy it for the episodes, which are top notch.
The second series was slightly more polished than the first. Groening, Simon and L Brooks had the formula for the Simpsons down and this is evident in episode like 'Dead putting society' and 'Blood Feud' and whilst these episodes do not exude the same blatant comedy of the later series the gags are more subtle, slightly political and very funny.
The only downside of this DVD is that 20th century Fox has adapted a menu style akin to the Harry Potter DVD and Memento special edition. In both these cases features were a chore to get to and while games were at first fun, became very tiresome. Each disc begins with a wheel of fortune like game of heads and bodies. Through this there will be no menu until you spin the wheel three times. This is a very amusing feature at first but soon becomes annoying having to continually spin the wheel before you watch the episodes. This was a mistake, but it doesn't matter the DVD set is great.
In this review I have opted to talk more about the DVD set's construction rather than the episodes themselves. I am a true fan of the Simpsons, I own all the episodes on tape from season 1-14 and I simply have to update to DVD. Everything that has to be said about the quality of the episodes already has by people getting in early reviews, trying to second guess what the set will be like. But take it from me, the DVD complete second season is amazing, this is the greatest way to compile the whole collection of the greatest TV show ever and this DVD set is of the highest quality, just as the first was. Bring on season three!",1027296000,14,2689,4.512295081967213
1690149,3,B000063EME,"Though it's no first season, this collection still lacks that typical Simpsons cynicism.  Most of the episodes end with a large amount of sap, that tends to make you sick.  Though it has it's moments, there's much to be desired.",1027209600,2,228,4.675
1690150,5,B000063EME,"I realize there are people who don't like the Simpsons-- one of my best friends (and I forgive her for this) hates them.  ...  But the Simpsons are a popular culture phenomenon-- where else would you get jokes that combine what we know about our world today with smart satire, social commentary, metaphoric brilliance and pure belly laughs?  ... (If you read GREAT LITERATURE you'll find the same thing, just cleverly disguised by the English teachers who don't let you in on the joke because they don't want to tell you it's always been this way).  People generally like belches & fart jokes better than they like witty commentary on the social condition of the middle class.  But every now and then, something comes along that has both... thus, I give you, the SIMPSONS!...
However-- the Simpsons has all this stuff.  Watch them-- own the whole darn collection.  Some of these you don't get to see on TV.  The Halloween episodes themselves are worth buying every DVD that ever comes out.  Even if you don't think you're really a Simpsons fan, you ought to at least give them a chance to prove that it's not just about Bart-- Homer is the Everyman of the 20th & 21st century, Marge makes [TV homemakers] look like a mere beginner, and Lisa-- ah, poor brainy girl.

1690151,5,B000063EME,"Well, I have to admit that a lot of people don't care for the first two seasons due to the fact that they think that the animation isn't as great as it was from season three on, and that the stories weren't as good as they would become, However, I see Season two differently than most people. I admit season one was rocky, but every new series is, but season two, I feel, was the Simpsons at some of their best. The animation is pretty much there, and I actually like the stories where there is actually some type of Plot and a good message that comes out of it, and just about all of the episodes in Season two were like that, it had its fun sarcastic humor and knocks at people and groups, but they had cute little phrases and one liners that were just wonderful. My favorite is from ""Bart the Daredevil"" at the very end, Homer is in the hospital in a full body cast next to the daredevil that Bart idols, and Homer tells him ""You think your Job is dangerous, try raising my kids"". I love that. It is cute and funny. The simpsons now in their 13th season are still strong, but they have resorted to very low tasteless, sexual humore that I, myself, don't find very funny. It is nice to have these ""Classics"" to go back to and watch over and over. Buy the set, you will love it.",1026345600,6,1279,4.161290322580645
1690152,5,B000063EME,"As good or better than the Season 1 set of discs. These discs are jam packed full of quality entertainment... twenty-two episodes from their 2nd season, commentary, 2 Bart videos (""Deep, Deep Trouble"", and ""Do the Bartman""), 3 different Butterfinger commercials, still photos, DVD easter eggs, and a special Emmy awards presentation. Animation is sharper - even the rougher (Season 1) Simpson's are fine with me. Comic wit is bolder and cruder. Over a decade of prime time animated TV and I still have not seen an episode I haven't liked.

""Simpson And Delilah""
""Treehouse Of Horror I""

Season 2 contains some classic early episodes... a favorite of mine, ""The War Of The Simpson's"". Marge signs herself and Homer up for counseling. They go to a cottage retreat where Homer battles his marriage as well as a giant fish. Season 2 also introduces the 1st Halloween special (""Treehouse Of Horror"")... which is now an annual party for the creators to think outside the box of normalcy. Having so many episodes on a few DVD's is worth it. Quality in picture, dolby sound, and everything else that goes with the incredible technology of the DVD. Only complaint here is it's 4 DVD's... even Homer would want this all on 1-2 DVD's so it's less time getting up off the sofa and having to change the discs in the DVD player.",1025481600,35,1847,4.753894080996885

1. It had a coupon for a lifetime supply of 100 Grand bars and Mountain Dew: Code Red

1690159,5,B000063EME,"Of course, I have not gotten a hold of this DVD, but I have gotten some facts about it... This DVD includes ALL of the Season 2 episodes (22 in all!), and it is, in my opinion, a great season.
It's really when the Simpsons started to gain its style. Plus there were many ""Firsts"" in the second season that are almost in every episode. Such as; the first appearance of Professor Frink and Hans Moleman, the first time Homer argues with his own brain, the very first Treehouse Of Horror, and many more. Below I have made a list of the episodes and put in a brief description to hopefully remind you of these great episodes.
The episodes include:
""Bart Gets An F""
When Bart discovers he might be held back, he makes a deal with Martin to help his grades.
""Simpson And Delilah""
Homer scams his employer's health insurance to afford a million dollar hair growth formula.
""Treehouse Of Horror I""
Bart and Lisa tell each other scary stories in the treehouse while Homer eavesdrops.
""Two Cars In Every Garage And Three Eyes On Every Fish""
When Bart and Lisa find a 3-eyed-fish in the river the nuclear plant is dumping waste into, it threatens Mr. Burns.
""Dancin' Homer""

""Dead Putting Society""

""Bart Vs. Thanksgiving""
After Bart destroys Lisa's Thanksgiving centerpiece, he runs away from home.
""Bart The Daredevil""
After Bart sees the monster truck show, he starts trying his own daredevil stunts, including jumping Springfield Gorge.
""Itchy & Scratchy & Marge""
Marge tries to tone down the violence on a popular cartoon show.
""Bart Gets Hit By A Car""
After a Mr. Burns' car hits Bart, Homer wants to sue Burns, but they will only win if they lie on stand.
""One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish""
After Homer eats a poisonous blowfish and only has 24 hours to live, he tries to make the best of the rest of his life.

""Three Men And A Comic Book""
Bart, Martin, and Millhouse fight over the true owner of a rare Radioactive Man comic book.
""Blood Feud""
When Burns needs a certain blood type to stay alive, they discover Bart has the perfect type.
For my rating, I have seen all of season 2, and almost every single episode, so trust me, your not wasting your money. The season itself earns 5 stars, but with the extras and the great DVD quality, it only gets better.
The episodes alone are worth the money, but the bonus material is more for your money! It would be nice to see some better DVD menus but I'm guessing the menus are going to remain the same it was before. The first DVD has crystal clear quality, this DVD will too, it's just so nice to look at, without those channel logos all over the screen. The extras will be great. The commentary is very informative and entertaining. The price may seem a little steep, but take a look at what you're getting, a WHOLE season of possibly the greatest show on television!
All Simpsons fans will get a hold of this DVD, I have the First Season, and there's nothing better than being able to watch The Simpsons anytime you want in your own home. I myself cannot wait until this summer, and neither can any other Simpsons fan. This, and the next upcoming seasons are really where the good ""Classic Simpsons"" are, any Simpson fan would agree. If we're lucky, I wouldn't be surprised to see the 3rd season out by the end of the year. I would recommend buying the first season as well just so you know the excellent quality your getting.

Season 3 is where you feel the characters finally solidify into their current state - especially Homer. He's no longer just an stupid ape-like loser - now he's a loveable oaf.
Seasons 1 and 2 are an integral part of the Simpsons and as such are priceless. However, Season 3 should be credited for breathing character into the Simpsons themselves.",1020211200,7,543,4.726315789473684

To be honest with you, I haven't seen any of the episodes of this season. I own the complete season 1 of the series on dvd and have most of the episodes taped of season 5,6,7,10,11 and the current season 12, which are equally excellent; but I have the simpsons episode guide containing information on seasons 1-7 and the episodes are fabulous!!!
It seems that the character drawings in season 2 will be as weird as that of the first season, probably a little better, since the show was still pretty new. The drawings get much better from season 3 onwards.
This is a must buy for all simpsons fan, since not only will you get all the episodes from season 2, but there are a LOT of additional features on this dvd, unlike that of season 1 which contained some features. To tell you the truth, they could have added a lot of other additional features on the season 1 dvd if they hadnt occupied so much space on the french and german dolby surround system ( they could have simply added the subtitles or something and put in some extra footage or something of that kind. )
All in all, from the special features listed, this is a great item to purchase, whether or not you know of the Simpsons! Pre order it now and please don't delay the release date any further FOX!",1018828800,5,2264,4.267605633802817

1) Bart Gets an F: Bart fails yet another test and makes a deal with Martin...tutoring in exchange for lessons in coolness.  Martin relishes his new persona and abandons the deal.  Bart tries his and still fails, but he manages to impress Mrs. Krabappel into giving him a D.
2)Simpson and Delilah:  Homer's new head of hair transforms from a lazy slob into a young go-getter...at least Mr. Burns thinks so.  He awards Homer a new position and an assistant named Karl.  Eventually he loses his new hair and new career.
3)Treehouse of Horror: The first in the annual series.  First tale finds the Simpsons in a haunted house that drives them mad.  In the second tale the family is abducted by Kang and Kodos.  The final segment is Homer's interpertaion of ""The Raven"".
4)Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish: Bart catches a three-eyed fish near the nuclear plant.  Despite the bad press, Homer persuades (sort of) Mr. Burns to run for governor.  The fish comes back to haunt him in the end when Marge serves it to him on live TV.
5)Dancin' Homer: Homer is the main attraction at the ballpark as the mascot for the Springfield Isotopes.  His crowd pleasing routine catches the eye of a recruiter for the Capital City Capitals. Homer and the family make the journey to Capital City where Homer finds his dancing is not well received.
6)Dead Putting Society: Bart and Todd square off in a miniature golf tournament while Homer and Ned square off with each other.  Both fathers push their kids to beat the other and make a foolish bet that they both lose in the process.
7)Bart vs. Thanksgiving:  Bart destroys Lisa's centerpiece and is ordered to his room.  Bart runs away and eats dinner in a homeless shelter where he is also put on TV.  Eventually he returns and makes up with Lisa.
8)Bart the Daredevil:  Bart becomes obsessed with risky skateboard stunts after seeing a daredevil at a monster truck rally.  Homer gets concerned and tries to dissuade Bart from performing his next stunt.  In the end, Homer, not Bart, accidentally attempts to jump Springfield Gorge.
9)Itchy Scratchy and Marge: Convinced that violent cartoons negatively influence children, Marge wages a successful battle to change Itchy and Scratchy.  The new shows flounder and kids abandon their television sets for the outdoors.  The show regains its former bloody glory when Marge fails to object to the display of questionable art.
10)Bart Gets Hit by a Car:  Mr. Burns hits Bart with his car, sending him to the hospital with minor injuries.  Lionel Hutz assures the family that they could successfully sue.  In court, the truth about Bart's feigned ailments comes to light.",1017014400,338,2871,4.74949494949495
1690173,4,B000063EME,"This is worth owning just to see where it all began. I actually consider this first season my least favorite. The animation is strange compared to what it evolved into. The characters seem like strangers. I mean, come on, HOMER is the one who sells the TV and takes the family in for counseling while Marge protests? Anyone watching the series this long must know that's like a Springfield in a different dimension. But seeing where it all begins makes you appreciate the show's evolution all the more. Obviously good enough never was for the creative team of the Simpsons. The packaging and extras on these DVD's (priced very reasonably in my opinion) make this set worth owning. You get to see all the opening chalkboard and couch gags, and no 'syndication' editing to worry about. I intend to buy the whole library. Of all the shows that are worth owning and can be watched over and over (there's always something you missed)this one is worth it.",1016409600,6,949,4.688622754491018

Really....the translation to Spanish is so incredibly funny that, to us Spanish speakers, it is even better than the original English version.

However, that's not true with the 2nd season DVD, and I'm eager to see what the Easter eggs on it are.
Most of the 2nd season episodes are terrific...but I should point out this season is the beginning of The Simpsons Halloween specials.  This is a Simpsons tradition that allows for some truly mind-boggling stories, break from character, and surprise/twist endings. It allows the show to explore ideas that would otherwise be extreme or impossible (not words used lightly with this show) for the non-Halloween episodes. The first occurrence of this annual special is a bit tame in comparison to the ones to follow, but it's still great fun.",1015718400,6,876,4.87248322147651

""The Simpsons - The Complete Second Season"" is funnier now than when they are on the commercial-laden reruns. In my town, we can see the reruns three times a day on network TV. However, it is much better to see an episode without the interuptions of commercials.

You've seen these episodes a dozen times each. With the various videos and interviews, it is a great deal.

I fully recommend ""The Simpsons - The Complete Second Season."" Amazon should, however, bundle the DVD with a box of donuts... mmm... donuts.... (Homer understands).

In fact, there are those of us who would like to see the very first copy of this DVD to go straight to the team that has been writing ""The Simpsons"" for the last 3 or 4 years - show them how it used to be done.  If you're hesitant for any reason about purchasing this DVD, have no fear.  It is, for lack of a better word, ""excellent"".",1015286400,8,617,4.0578512396694215

7959133,5,B000063EME,I've had the Simpson's on DVD for years.  The commentaries that you can't get anywhere else worth it.  This is the show at it's best in the awesome first 10 seasons.  Personally my favorite episode from this season is Bart the general.  Bart gets kids who were abused by Nelson Muntz to stop him.  If you like comedy or animation you need this.,1504396800,,344,4.396825396825397
