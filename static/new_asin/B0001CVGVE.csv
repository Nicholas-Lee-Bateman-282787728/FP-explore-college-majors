8010386,5,B0001CVGVE,"I first stumbled across Suesan's tone-up work-out 11 years ago while living in Santa Barbara.  I attended her tone-up class at a local gym approximately 3 times a week.  As a result of the class, I noticed remarkable improvements in muscle definition and muscle strengthening.  The work-out was unlike any other one I had ever done, and the results were fabulous!
As it came time for me to move away from Santa Barbara, I could not leave Suesan's methods behind.  I eagerly purchased a video tape from her and continued her methods in the privacy of my own home in Texas.  For the past several years, Suesan has been a regular part of my weekly work-out routine; hence, you can only imagine how distraught I was this morning to discover that my VCR had shredded my video tape.  Luckily, I was able to find Suesan's products online and ordered my updated DVD version today!
I look forward to many more years of exercise with Suesan.  Thank you Suesan for your innovative approach to muscle toning!",1075334400,2,996,4.6571428571428575
8010387,5,B0001CVGVE,"I tried this workout routine on the advice of a friend and was/am pleasantly surprised with the results.  As a late 40s man who has always stayed in shape with aerobic exercise and weights, I found the Tone-Up workout enhances my other activity, giving me improved energy, muscle definition, balance/equilibrium, and physical confidence. The routine was particularly useful in helping me identify and correct problems in posture and flexibility as I recovered from knee surgery.
Of particular appeal to this DVD are 1)the encouraging, non-stressful approach of creator Suesan (even as she performs the routine with you) and 2)finding you scarcely need more equipment than a chair and some light weights (which your wife or girlfriend probably has laying around.
Guys: show these women you too can be your best body. You will notice the changes and they will too.",1075161600,2,862,5.1571428571428575
