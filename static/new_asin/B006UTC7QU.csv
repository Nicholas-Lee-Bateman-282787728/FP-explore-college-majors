Made the opera come alive, unlike most productions which are stuffy and feel old. Holten is coming to the Israeli Opera in Tel Aviv to direct Don Giovanni (Juan?) in February 2018. Can't wait!",1503100800,,310,4.271186440677966

8504775,5,B006UTC7QU,"This is  very close to the kind of approach to opera on film that I've always wanted, but in some respects it goes a little too far in trying to be like a TV crime drama in the style of 'Spiral' (by far the best example of any TV crime drama since 'The Wire'). This has the result of preventing some of the music from having its full operatic, or even its full musical effect, whether due to distractions or, because when a character is shown alone, the vocal part is presented as happening inside the head of the character. One of the duets is also presented like this presumably on the grounds that showing those characters singing their very different internal thoughts together would have been too unrealistic in that scene.

I have already written some other reviews in which I have complained about the serious deficiencies of all other opera films in which the sound of a previously made studio recording is used and singers are filmed miming to it. My particular interest in this film is how things have been done differently.

Here the main advance on any previous opera films has to do with the fact that the singing was really done live on set and location.  But although  the lip-sync may be convincing,  there is still slightly  insufficient sense of the actual acoustic that might be expected from the scene for the reality to be totally convincing and so you may still have some of the usual problem with suspension of disbelief.
Using concealed wireless mikes would tend to largely eliminate the way voices sound in a particular space, but recording for 5.1 'surround' can supply  the necessary sense of the acoustic environment. Of course the bigger the television screen the bigger the central speaker needs to be to capture the same intimacy but I was surprised by the amount of difference that a good centre made in capturing the acoustic. Before I experimented, I had imagined that this job was being done by the other 4 speakers. But I guess that due to whatever way they were getting the orchestra itself into the singer's ears, and into the sound mix, the front left and right speakers do not participate in  producing the sense of  acoustic space that we need in order to believe the characters are really singing. So it's down to the centre and the two rears. A directional mike with variable focus was probably used in the outdoor scenes for the centre speaker but I would have liked a wider focus most of the time as I was not always 100% convinced by the reality this production aimed for.
This is certainly more successful than any previous attempts to capture opera on film. It has a lot to do with other aspects of the sound engineering and the crucial matter of relating the voices to each other according to proximity, and how the voices recede into the distance or move into the foreground in the context of the camera's view. This again is something that previous opera films have not attended to and another reason why they have never worked due to  the impossibility of achieving suspension of disbelief.

My reservations about this film only concern the minutiae of the very free idiomatic translation. Some of  the recitative passages strike a false note, either because they seem rather harsh or brutal, or on the other hand seem a bit feeble coming from that character at that particular moment; and others indulge in extremes of the vulgar vernacular and produce a jarring effect even for someone quite familiar with such shows as 'The Wire' and 'Spiral'. My other regret is the  decision  to make Leporello  an East European who always leaves out the definite and indefinite article in his English. This makes translation much easier in a number of places but it doesn't do Mozart any favours as it seems to spoil the musical line. But most of the translation, where it matters most, in the arias, is very clever and well fitted to the equally clever adaptation of the story. Even at its most disconcerting and uncomfortable the translation for all its necessary updating in this contemporary setting is remarkably close to the original in the spirit and the letter.  Mozart's Don, being an aristo, could get away with almost anything in the way he treated the plebs, and almost anyone else as well.
Otherwise I just wish they had dispensed with the harpsichord which sounds anachronistic among the rest of the updating and should have been replaced by an orchestral  ground bass.

I look forward to ALL future opera films being made in this way or not at all. The recent film version of Les Miserables  musical also deserves watching and listening to for this reason although much of the singing and camera direction is poor -  too much is shot in close-up and with hand held steadicam. Nevertheless some of the numbers come across very powerfully due to the directness of the  live singing/acting performances.",1442793600,3,4856,4.72189349112426
8504776,4,B006UTC7QU,"I can't really review this film, because I can't see it. It's not here at Amazon. It's not at Netflix. It never made it out here to the San Francisco Bay Area as far as I can tell. It exists only out there on the net, in fragments. WTF?!",1397347200,,237,3.857142857142857
8504777,5,B006UTC7QU,The opera has a modern setting - very modern and is sung in English. What a great way to do opera. I think Mozart would be very pleased. Would love to see more operas redone this way.,1391040000,5,183,3.972972972972973
