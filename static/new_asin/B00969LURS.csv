8536536,5,B00969LURS,"Top notch musicianship. The instruments are clear and very well mixed. Symphonic/Folk are my two favorite genres in prog. I've never liked many prog/metal/syphonic/folk bands fronted by women for a multitude of reasons but usually because their voice just doesn't belong with the music. Hayley is such a beautiful addition both aesthetically and vocally to this band. Her voice can straight up carry a song that's already perfect on its own. Her voice can float beautifully, cut through with an edge or just soar on top the unbelievably well thought out compositions. Great great band and a great watch.",1458172800,,603,5.101010101010101

8536538,4,B00969LURS,"I have become a big Karnataka fan over the past few years.  Rachael was awesome, and Lisa was also excellent.  First band was great, second lineup also great musicians.  I enjoyed watching the guys jam on this dvd as on their first dvd.  I miss Rachael singing though and would have liked to see Lisa for her songs.  Can you make an instrumental version?  Ok I was going to give this dvd 2 stars but after watching a few more times had to up it to 4 just because I really like the music.  So if you are wondering why I did not comment on the new singer, every time I thought about her emotionless (albeit pitch perfect) vocals, her bizarre and unnatural hand and body movements, and her half time wardrobe change... well momma said if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all.  Did I mention how great the music is!",1367798400,,828,4.296774193548387
