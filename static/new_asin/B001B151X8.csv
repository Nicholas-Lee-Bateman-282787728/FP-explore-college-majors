3477713,5,B001B151X8,"Excellent documentary on the Space Program.
The older footage has been remastered and looks good.
The HD sequences of the launches look amazing.
The musical score is great.

The Space Race with the Mercury program. Project Gemini.
The Apollo missions with the massive Saturn V rockets.
The Challenger mission segment has candid admissions (Story Musgrave).
Footage of the first untethered EVA by Bruce McCandless is great.
The Hubble Telescope repair mission puts you in the EVAs.
Construction of the International Space Station.
Disc 4 is a Bonus Disc of original NASA films.

My only complaint with this package is the Blu-ray case. They could have used a better center hub for holding the discs. The one they used makes it difficult to remove the discs for viewing.",1220486400,71,768,5.039370078740157
3477714,5,B001B151X8,"I will definitely purchase the series the day it's released. It is the best series I've seen for NASA and the personal recollections and stories of the astronauts are wonderful. It's a beautifully done series, and I highly recommend it.",1220400000,8,236,4.925
3477715,5,B001B151X8,"Although the discs haven't been released as of this writing, I did watch this documentary in HD when it was broadcast. The astronauts interviewed gave fascinating insights into their individual missions and, in many cases, they were emotionally moving. It's a shame that sit down interviews like this weren't conducted before other astronauts from those early days passed on - like Alan Shepard, Pete Conrad, and Deke Slayton.
The restored NASA film from the missions are beautiful and it's quite a treat to see them again after so many years.
Bravo!",1217030400,24,550,5.054945054945055
3477716,5,B001B151X8,"This might be the most extraordinary documentary I've ever seen; the original archive footage is vivid, and it's especially clear when you play the DVDs on a large screen. The interviews add special insight into what the people involved with NASA's beginnings have really accomplished. For me, the most moving segments were the ones depicting the Apollo moon landings and struggles of the space shuttle program. For anyone with an interest in space exploration or engineering, I would highly recommend getting ""When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions"". It's a documentary from which you can't help getting a sense of awe, even if the actual events seem like boring history now. It's history that can be relived just by watching this incredible miniseries.",1216425600,4,753,5.130081300813008
3477717,2,B001B151X8,"When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions is a great production done by the Discovery Channel on the early years of NASA to today. It has great interviews of the surviving astronauts and members of mission control and NASA. The films and footage from the all the missions and flight tests are great.

The series on TV was so great, I decided that instead of just recording it off the dish, I bought the DVD set. Even though the DVDs had no playing problems or defects, after putting the DVD in the player I noticed several things wrong. These are the reasons that I give the product 2 stars.

1. Contrary to belief, this DVD set is not the same DVD set being offered at Discovery Channel. This set contains 3 DVDs, not the 4 being offered at the Discovery Store or on TV. The 3 DVD set on this page does not include the 4 hours of bonus footage that is included with the set at Discovery Store or [...].

2. The discs are DVD-R. I did not see this when I ordered the DVDs, but the DVDs are really DVD-Rs, the same format that you burn DVDs in your recorder or burner. Plus, the Discovery people didn't even put chapters inside the episodes, so if you wanted to go to a specific point in the episode, you will have to fast forward to it.

3. One big mistake that is definitely the fault of Discovery is that on the DVD case it says that it is 16:9 widescreen. When I played the DVDs, they were all full screen.

As I stated before, the two star rating is not on the content of the episodes, but the way this product was released by Discovery. If I knew that this DVD set had only one of the issues I listed above, I would not have purchased it.

If you want to get the real final version of When We Left Earth, search [...] because I saw that the 4-Disc version will be released in September.",1216339200,21,1787,4.165217391304348
3477718,5,B001B151X8,"The first reason to buy this DVD has already been covered in other reviews.  The picture is superior to previous NASA documentaries.
The second reason is that the makers of the film somehow managed to get Neal Armstrong to contribute on screen commentary of his experiences on both Gemini 8 and Apollo 11.  His commentary ends when program gets to the part where he begins his historic first walk on the Moon.  Still, it is great to finally see him in a documentary of this type.",1215561600,6,479,4.546511627906977
3477719,5,B001B151X8,"This is a great complement to ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and even more can be learned about the space program with this series.  FtEttM, while based on actual events is not a documentary, and actors portray the real guys....  In this series, the real guys are here to tell the story.

I was AMAZED at the ton of new footage and the quality of the film that was remastered into High Def.  Excellent stuff.",1214697600,3,406,4.302631578947368
3477720,5,B001B151X8,"I've seen every NASA/space documentary that I can find and this one is with out a doubt the best.  I expected to see mostly old footage that had been in every other documentary but I was very surprised at how much I had never seen before.

The documentary is basically a history of NASA and covers 5 main areas. The Mercury program which was sending the first men into space to determine if people could survive in zero gravity. Next was the Gemini program which was to learn how to live in space and safely return. Next was the Apollo program which was landing a man on the moon and safely returning him to earth.  Next was the Skylab program, being able to do research in space. Finally, there is the ISS program with the space shuttles. This covers the initial building of the International Space Station, the Shuttle creation with coverage of both the Challenger and Columbia disasters.

Up until this point, I felt that the Tom Hanks narrated documentary, ""From the earth to the moon"" was the best I'd ever seen. I think that this one surpasses it.  I particularly liked all the interviews with past Astronauts and Flight Directors.  The documentary makers did a brilliant job getting so many key people to be interviewed.

Even if your not particularly interest in space travel, I would suggest that this documentary is very inspiring and it really proves that people can achieve the impossible if collectively we try hard enough. It's worth a look just for all the new footage.

Overall, a very well put together and exciting documentary - even for those of us who've covered this subject extensively.",1214438400,44,1608,4.697508896797153
3477721,5,B001B151X8,"I've been watching this series on Discovery and I'm amazed at the clarity of the footage.  I can't wait to receive the DVDs and view all the bonus footage.

This will look great on my shelf next to Planet Earth!

5 stars is an insult...I give it all the starts in the galaxy!",1213747200,4,275,4.150943396226415

3477727,2,B001B151X8,"I am of the opinion that videos should be rated on Amazon solely for their packaging and condition rather than their content.  If you want a movie review, go to Rotten Tomatoes or something.
The problem with the blu-ray packaging, here, is that the discs fit so snugly into the jacket that it is incredibly difficult to pry them out of their seats without bending the discs.  Do this a few times and all of a sudden, your discs won't work anymore.  Terrible packaging design.",1504915200,,475,4.564705882352941

3477731,5,B001B151X8,"As others have noted, ""When We Left Earth"" is an excellent short history of the U.S. space program up to the first set of repairs on Hubble.  It includes SpaceLab, one of the predecessors to the International Space Station, which is rarely mentioned nowadays.  It is an excellent short history because for any program or mission the documentary covers we get the personalities, politics, geopolitics, special technology, and more that were involved.  It does not shy away from controversy, like the Chris Kraft/Scott Carpenter debate over Carpenter's Mercury flight, and the disasters of Apollo 1, Challenger, and Columbia.  For what this documentary claimed to be, it far exceeded my expectations.  Of course, if you are a space nerd, you will want more than what you will find in ""When We Left Earth,"" as excellent as it is.  To supplement this cornerstone documentary series, I recommend at a minimum the DVD ""Moon Machines"" for its coverage of Apollo project technology (although engineers will be disappointed by its broad-stroke coverage of engineering problems --- and no math) and the DVD from the Criterion Collection, ""For All Mankind"", for the psychological and philosophical aspects of humans in space (as conveyed by a thematic and impressionistic presentation of the Apollo missions as if it were one mission) with film footage that had never been seen before because the film was developed only when the director of ""For All Mankind"" asked NASA for it to finally be developed. Don't dismiss the concept of ""For All Mankind"" until you have seen it.  But if you only buy one US space program documentary, of my recommended three or any currently out there, get ""When We Left Earth.""",1499212800,,1695,5.0321428571428575

3477733,5,B001B151X8,"This series is exceptionally good, and particularly so given the price.  The episodes chronicle the evolution of space travel from the first Gemini missions up to the twilight years of the space shuttle program.  We likely all know how all these stories end, but the program manages to create a great sense of tension despite that.  Gary Sinise was a great chose to narrate the program; his tone is perfect to tell the story.  Plenty of interviews are included during the episodes, showing the state of mind of everyone at the time.  I really enjoyed this.",1498003200,,556,4.75

3477740,5,B001B151X8,"I'm a space and aviation nerd and for the price I couldn't pass this up!  It's a very good history of the space programs up until just after the Columbia accident.  The three DVDs are the documentary and the fourth DVD is bonus material.  I haven't seen the latter yet but the doc is great!  There's even some stuff I hadn't seen or heard about so it wasn't the same old stuff repackaged into yet another set of DVDs.  Speaking of which, I'd love to see this on Blu-Ray!  The metal collector's tin is also really cool.  It may not be super interesting for kids but otherwise, I doubt any space enthusiast will be disappointed!",1490572800,6,626,4.391304347826087

3477929,5,B001B151X8,"All of the episodes I have watched so far (1-3) have been excellent, especially when you take note that each one is less than 60 minutes in length. Episode 3 covers some of the enormous difficulties that any Nation faced in trying to land men on the moon. The Apollo 1 tragedy is briefly covered, and how in fact it furthered the program even at the cost of three astronaut's lives. The primary focus is the Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 missions. Apollo 8 sent three men all the way to the moon, even though there was no landing. In some ways it is/was more exciting than Apollo 11, when the first moon landing was successfully made. The excitement and sheer danger of Apollo 8 is poinently conveyed. Many people forget, and many more don't even know, that Apollo 8 was the first time human beings road the most powerful rocket to ever fly; the rocket was larger than the Statue of Liberty and it carried so much fuel that if it blew up it would unleash energy and destruction equal to that of a tactical nuclear bomb. The original Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 astronauts are interviewed and original film of the the missions is shown. How and why the Russians dropped out of the cold-war Race to the Moon is also revealed. Only 12 men, all American's have ever set foot on the moon. No one has been back to the moon or any further into space than low earth orbit since 1972. Compared to the technical challenges that were met and overcome by the Apollo missions, the International Space Station is astronautical child's play.",1403654400,10,1514,4.469314079422382
3477930,5,B001B151X8,"I am a teacher in NYC. We are currently studying Space Science.  We played this DVD as a supplement to our academic curriculum.  It is perfect because it can be viewed within one period.  The DVD is about 45 minutes long. My 5th graders loved it.

The price was awesome as well. Individually priced at Kennedy Space Center the cost would have be $25.00 each IMAX.
 I ordered a bundle of three DVD's for $27.00!
The bundle included:
IMAX Hubble,

This is the mini-series to watch if you like learning about NASA (especially, it's early days when they were basically just strapping guys to rockets... we still do, but you know what I mean...). This collection will never be out-done due to its inclusion of so many interviews and commentary by all the greatest (Neil, Buzz, Frank, Gene... the list goes on and on)

3477947,5,B001B151X8,"I'm the type of person who would much rather watch a well produced documentary on technology or biographical so when I saw the title I was very interested. As the old saying goes who has not wanted to be an astronaut when they grew up at one point or another. Truth be told I still wish I could be.

I know there a number of documentaries out there on our nations first steps into the great unknown but this particular series really instilled a sense of awe, fascination, and honor that should never be dissolved from this great endeavor. One of the aspects I greatly appreciate is the honesty of acknowledging that we were not the first in: Satellite orbiting, launching a man into orbit, or space walking. But this nation was absolutely unmatched in the support given to the men and women of NASA and the admiration for their courage. When they launched, we prayed. When they lost lives, we cried.

When I buy movies, its because I want to see the special features and commentaries and out-takes, and deleted scenes because these things give me more to enjoy about a movie I already like. Sometimes the collection of features add substantial value and insight; sometimes they add none.

3477975,5,B001B151X8,"The NASA Missions is a superbly produced cohesive story of the people and hardware that initiated the United States manned space exploration.  It follows the cast and crew both in the capsule and on the ground while also providing the political backdrop of the urgency to get it done.

The focus is on the manned missions.  You won't hear anything about the many probes sent all over the solar system in the same time frame.

My favorite parts are the interviews with the astronauts decades after the flights that made them famous.  John Young looks like your harmless next-door neighbor and he has more brains and courage in his appendix than most of us have in our entire gastrointestinal system.

I taught an high school Astronomy elective and this series was the semester's capstone.  It's one thing to observe and infer.  It's another thing entirely to go and see.  The students seemed enjoy the series thoroughly.

The sadness comes with the realization that the current capabilities of the United States manned space program is where it was before John Glenn circled the earth for the first time in 1962.  The sadness comes from watching my students realize that we as a country have lost the drive to study space in person. (What do you mean they didn't replace the Shuttle?)  It comes from listening to President Kennedy's words promising returning a man from a landing on the moon and knowing that political will like that simply doesn't exist anymore.

Don't get me wrong, NASA is doing some amazing things.  The rovers on Mars, Messenger, and the new Webb IR telescope are big and bold in their own right.  But I want to know when we're taking golf clubs to the Red Planet.",1387756800,,1685,4.722602739726027

While the footage was dated - this gives a good overall view of the brave individuals who first explored the boundries of space. Many young people do not have a clue - riding on top of a missle was a daring thing in its day!!! My respect for these pioneers is very deep and our world is how it is because of individuals like the original Mercury 7, the ""new"" Gemini 9 and the rest. They took great risk and time to do what still is part of our space exploration legacy.",1382745600,,489,4.147368421052631

I watch it free on my Prime Members account and loved it so much I ordered up the Limited Addition so I could get the 4 hour bonus footage.  When We Left Earth makes you feel good to be an American.

And this series takes you through the progression.....in 6 stages!  I could watch one or two a night.....and looked forward to continuing the story.  A lot of live footage made for not the clearest pictures.....but that is what it was like then!

It does a great job of covering the NASA missions from early spaceflight through the Space Shuttle program. The pace is very good, and it's made to cover a wide variety of audiences, so I think it could be a good choice to show as part of a school program, or to watch with kids. While some of the Hollywood movies on this subject are also quite good (The Right Stuff, Apollo 13, From the Earth to the Moon), this one has a more educational focus.",1382140800,,572,4.40566037735849

3477992,3,B001B151X8,"sold now at an incredibly low price, this is a must-have. It just lacks some informations on the rockets used (Saturn etc.) and is very basic about NASA missions from the end of the 70ies.",1380585600,,188,4.4

3477997,5,B001B151X8,"What is wonderful about this series is that it has interviews with people that were actually there and give insights to what the thought process was during each step. For instance, it hadn't occured to me that when they first started Mission Control, no one knew what anything was about and any tools that were made back then weren't made for space travel, they had to adapt what they had for a whole new type of machine.

Names like Shepherd, Glen, Grissom, Schirra, Lovell, Conrad, Young, Armstrong,Cernan and all the astronauts were to me then and still today true American Heroes of the first degree and i almost tear up watching this splendid film of my boyhood heroes. I still can recall sitting in front of the TV in July of 69 as a nine year old boy and watching in absolute spell bound wonder and pride as Neil Armstrong took one small step for a man & one Giant leap for man kind. We as a people and a nation need more such leaps, more such heroes. Instead of a bunch of jack asses like Justin bieber our young should have men & women like Jim Lovell and Sally Ride to look up to. This film is perfect for that purpose-it should be required viewing at every grade school and high school.

It's really rather sad that most Americans could probably remember that Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon, but could they remember the name of the other man with him on the moon? This series traces not only the Apollo missions, but the earlier Mercury missions and the later shuttle age, with interviews included of the astronauts involved and lots of footage of the period, and it's all very well put together and continuously engaging.",1376352000,,595,4.900990099009901

A time to remember how great this program was for our nation as it brought us together.  It gave us a purpose to fulfill expectations  in space never dreamed of, but accomplished.  To remember the sites on television of them walking on the moon is still to this day unbelievable.",1375228800,,455,4.65

3478023,5,B001B151X8,"While the excellent ""From the Earth to the Moon"" focuses almost entirely on the Apollo missions, this documentary box covers everything from Mercury to ISS.

I was positively impressed about the fact that failures and disasters in NASA programs where not largely white-washed and glossed over, but earnestly covered and explained.
The picture quality of old archive material is surprisingly great, while the more modern is breathtaking on Blu-Ray.

So now this set has to be called the reference in manned space flight documentary!
If you want more detail on the Apollo missions (and the ultimate answer why the US won the race to the Moon), the box set ""From the Earth to the Moon"" is still a fantastic extension.",1374019200,,714,4.941666666666666

I learned a good deal about the NASA missions as well that I had never heard. Well worth watching, and something you'll likely watch again.",1371686400,,254,4.543478260869565
3478038,5,B001B151X8,"Great series about the history of NASA and the missions that changed space exploration in the last 40 years.

The first three episodes are the most interesting in my opinion, because it shows the early missions about how they were able to land on the moon.

3478050,5,B001B151X8,"This is a very comprehensive documentary. It has lots of original footage and  lots of interviews, even with Neil Armstrong. It includes footage from x-15  to Mercury, and the Shuttle.

Just the Gemini Chapter and the Shuttle Chapters are worth the price of the whole series.

In conclusion, this series tries to get the personal aspects of the participants with lots of interviews along with the political hurdles. This is not just the same old low budget documentary with lots of footage and the same monotonous commentary in the background.

Very recommendable.",1368489600,,564,5.086956521739131

3478055,5,B001B151X8,What a series! There is so much to see that has not been widely released to the public before. The interviews with those involved are some of the best around. They captured space exploration so well for the past 50 years. Amazing.,1367020800,,230,4.5

The packaging is great other than the tight fit of the discs. The discs follow the US Space program from start to the shuttle and ISS. Only recently did I finally watch the original NASA documentaries on the last disc. I would have paid for this disc alone as it has so much great original footage. It is the cherry on top!

3478065,5,B001B151X8,I watched this with my 7 year old son.  Each series built upon the last and the narration was not dry.  The progression of the space program is very exciting and I think it is one of man's most triumphant accomplishments.  The series does not just focus on the successes and gloss over the failures.

The thing that this show does best, is depicting just how risky and bold some of the earlier missions were. There are some truly thrilling moments, and they do a great job capturing and presenting that drama. There are many interviews with Astronauts and mission control, and lots of beautiful old footage.

The interviews not only help with the story telling, but give us a glimpse into the personalities of the many exceptional people that work for NASA. In fact, as the film highlights, they have so much integrity that they are willing to admit to their mistakes and get better, which is refreshing when it comes to any large organization. In general it gives you hope that humans can run excellent organizations, even large ones, recover from their mistakes, and do truly amazing things.

It makes for a great story. The way the content is delivered is well thought out.

3478092,5,B001B151X8,As a person who grew up during the Space Shuttle era who is sad to see its end I always wanted to learn more about the origins . I watched the first episode and was immediately hooked and found myself watching a marathon one episode after another. I found ways to share these videos with my science students and to this day at least one was inspired to go into astronomy. I share these with students and family and everyone has the same response AMAZING....Having met John Youg before seeing the videos I know have an even greater respect for him and all former and current astronauts as well as ground control personnel. After loosing Neil Armstrong this year along with Sally Ride I realize that we will be loosing more of these great Heros over the coming years and what better way to honor them than to learn and share their accomplishments with everyone. By doing so maybe inspire the next generation of explorers or those that will support them. There is nothing better than hearing about the stories from those who lived it or we're there to witness it. Excellent work putting this series together NASA and Discovery Channel.,1350777600,,1132,4.63681592039801

3478096,5,B001B151X8,"As some others have said, the footage could have been tidied up a little on the digital transfer, but at the same time it gives it authenticity. The up to date interviews are particularly good, but it would have been nice to have some interviews included from back in the day from those who are no longer with us like Ed White. It could also have spent some time looking at Werner Von Braun and his influence and spent more time on Apollo 1 and less on Nixon using successes as a political tool. For me, the stand out moments are Gemini 4, Apollo 8 and STS 1. One thing I do suggest for anyone thinking about 3D HDTV  - TVs with 2D to 3D conversion makes you feel you're there. I've tried it with many shows, DVDs and blu rays, and I've seen the 3D IMAX Space Station and Hubble blu rays, but this does a wonderful job. Maybe it's 60s film that does it, but seeing a Saturn V and Space Shuttle go up in 3D and Dolby Digital and Ed White floating about above earth is about as close as you'll get to being there. The pre-Mercury exploding unmanned rockets in 3D are pretty fun too.",1341187200,,1080,4.167464114832536

3478100,5,B001B151X8,"""When We Left Earth"" is a wonderful documentary of the American manned spaceflight program, with broad coverage of the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo/Shuttle programs spread across this four-disc DVD set.  One of my favorite features of this documentary is the fact that it makes extensive use of commentary from the original astronauts, mission controllers, and other key figures of NASA from the 1960's forward; it is very much a ""living history"" of NASA from the X-15 program to present day.  I also really enjoy that this program makes extensive use of original NASA footage and audio recordings; it does a great job of presenting the source material for the events it covers.  I've been inspired by space exploration since I was young, and this DVD set excites my love of spaceflight and helps remind me that man is capable of anything, so long as we set our minds and energy to the task.  I highly recommend ""When We Left Earth"" as a primer for those new to learning about spaceflight (young and old), enthusiasts looking for a broad and exciting summary of NASA's manned flight programs over the past 60 years, or those looking to experience the wonder of some of man's greatest accomplishments.

Briefly, I'd like to mention that while this series offers informative coverage of the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo/Shuttle programs, it is by no means all-encompassing.  For those interested in first-hand accounts of these events in MUCH greater (and exciting!) detail, I HIGHLY recommend the books ""Flight: My Life in Mission Control"" by Chris Kraft, and ""Failure is Not an Option"" by Gene Kranz.  These two books, coupled with this DVD set, are a treasure-trove of information which is highly accessible to the average reader/viewer.  Enjoy, and remember, ""We have to continue to move forward.  To stop in space is to surrender."" -Gene Kranz, Flight Director and Director of NASA Mission Operations from 1960-1994.",1334534400,,1905,5.09967845659164

First of all, not every immigrant or resident in this great country of ours speaks or understand the

when the sound or spelling/diction goes in a whisper kind of conversation or way too fast..that, generally
is very much undistinguishable!!! Again to me, that's a very irresponsible and,[ININTELLIGENT and UNPROFESSIONAL]
way to sell an EDUCATIONAL or any movie or video at all!! Period..! I have bought a huge number of videos/
dvds which to my surprise the way they speak at times is so unintelligible!! and, unfortunately no close
caption, no subtitles, or no other language optional. This my friend, is a shame; why?? because is a waste
of money when you pay for an interesting subject/documentary or movie and the way it sounds (spoken) is
terrible and you end up understanding just too little!! When is somebody going to take action and do this

It includes interesting commentary from former and current astronauts, amazing video from NASA archives, and an inspiring soundtrack.  The series starts with the Mercury and Gemini missions, moves onto the Apollo program and Moon landing, and ends with the shuttles. The series covers NASA's proudest moments; the first space walk, Moon landing, space station, and space telescope. The series also discusses the programs worst tragedies; the fire on Apollo 1, the Challenger explosion, and the break-up of the Columbia.

Well, the first EVER space walk was performed by Russian Alexey Leonov on March 18 1965. Please don't get me wrong, as I've just said Ed White is indeed a hero, like any other astronaut.

CLASSIC , EDUCATIONAL and if you even have a SLIVER of understanding of spaceflight , plenty of THRILLS in the recounts and ACTUAL FOOTAGE .

NASA contributes largely never before seen footage and eyewitness accounts and astronaut interviews as well. Each episode is carefully constructed to meet a theme.

The DVD starts from the very beginning of the space program with all the attempts before success. The choices of the first seven male astronauts for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration program better known as NASA. Each episode is well-detailed and explained to the novice viewer.

Even if you're not that into space exploration, this DVD collection offers more than going to the moon. The DVD's carefully covered the Columbia and Challenger disasters carefully without exploiting it. There is a clip of Sharon Christa McAuliffe who died aboard the Challenger disaster and another female astronaut watching another shuttle takeoff about a month before the ill-fated tragedy of Challenger.

If there is one complaint, it's the omission of Sally Ride, the first female astronaut, in this documentary special. She was the first American female astronaut to get to space in the shuttle. There have been others and some are here.",1319068800,,1243,5.267676767676767

The footage is incredible. The story gives you tingles watching it. I was not born at this time, not even close, and neither were any of my friends who loved this series as well. But it really gave us a great sense of feeling of what went on, and the great accomplishments of this country going to the moon.

It covers all the moon missions.  I can usually judge whether I'll like the DVD from the first 10 minutes (if not the first 5), and I loved it from the beginning - could not keep my eyes off it.

Also bits of Chris Kraft,and Gene as in charge of Flight. Later in the forth bonus DVD some video on Gemini.

A truly fantastic DVD set. Recommended for anyone interested in space exploration as well as history buffs. I even enjoyed the older NASA videos on the bonus forth DVD.

3478144,1,B001B151X8,"I saw a deal for this series on a website I frequent where I could download it for free, so I decided to give it a shot. As far as the video content goes, it's fantastic and gives a very detailed look on past space flight and how we got to where we are today.

However, the entire ""On Demand"" process is unnecessarily tedious and limiting. First off, you must use Amazon's video player to watch the videos. This wouldn't be too bad of a problem, but the aspect ratio is completely incorrect and cuts off half of the picture no matter what setting you choose. Secondly, you may only download the files a specific number of times. Now if I had paid for this rather than used a coupon code, that would be the last straw. I am not going to pay full price for a product and not receive a physical copy, then be limited to a sub-par video player as well as be limited in how many times I can download it.

Furthermore, the actual video quality on this series is very low, so don't expect anything you can actually watch on a TV and not have it look extremely pixelated.

The only way I could actually watch the videos in their full quality without any problems is by ripping out the DRM using Daniusoft Media Converter. After removing the dependence on the awful Amazon video player, VLC media player did an amazing job of playing the videos and now I can actually enjoy them.

Amazon, if you are going to require users to use your proprietary media player to watch on demand videos, it better be the best damned video player ever created rather than the sloppy bang-up job that it is now. The limits on the number of downloads as well as forcing people to use your specific software is exactly why piracy is getting bigger every day. People don't want to deal with DRM and poorly coded software. Get with the program, make it easy for the end user, and maybe this ""On Demand"" thing will take off. I for one will never purchase anything again from the On Demand section after thoroughly testing this junk.",1261008000,10,1999,4.365591397849462

I already own numerous documentaries featuring the Space Race, but the title caught my attention during 2009 and the 40th Anniversary of Apollo 11. I first watched a few portions with my daughters and could not wait to show it to my students. The 4-Disc set is worth the relatively cheap price just to clear up misconceptions about Gus Grissom's ill-fated Mercury flight and the sinking of his craft ... misconceptions generated by ""The Right Stuff"" movie. To hear the comments of Gene Kranz at Mission Control as Gus was fighting to stay afloat in the ocean gave me greater understanding of his plight. Each disc has exciting stories to tell, but it is the Mercury-Apollo discs that are most captivating. The first-time-revealed archival footage and interviews from the astronauts and flight controllers are spellbinding. My students sat enthralled through three days of watching when I first unwrapped the set in class. Not a word was spoken and enthusiastic applause followed the final disc recalling Apollo 11's conquest.

3478152,4,B001B151X8,"Being thirty years old and not having lived through the ""Space Race"", i have been amazed by what this documentary brings to light. It is well narrated with great interviews and wonderful original footage that really brings you into what transpired. My wife and i have thoroughly enjoyed viewing this program.

There are some issues with it, which is why i only gave it four stars. First of all, with the information, it sometimes seems like they go too quickly through certain events without explaining everything - of course this is understandable given the scope of what they are covering and putting it in eight episodes. But sometimes i wish there would be a little more information provided about some things.

Also, i did notice the dirt speck that has been discussed. But i also wonder if these individuals actually watched the whole program or only the first 10 minutes of the first disc and gave up on it. After the first 10 minutes of the first disc, i did not notice the spot there anymore through the rest of the program (and i was looking). It certainly was a little annoying while it was on the screen - but i think that's because i read about it here and was looking for it, and when i found it i couldn't keep my eyes off of it. Would i have noticed if i had not been tipped off about it? I'm not sure. It really isn't all that large. And i didn't tell my wife about it and she never complained about it, so i don't think she noticed it. So perhaps unless you're just REALLY obsessive about every inch of the screen every second, perhaps it can be overlooked at just problematic original film (which has been pointed out it is not, but if the mind can explain it away like that, then it becomes a non-issue). And like i said, after the first 10 minutes or so, you don't need to worry about it anyway. I just feel sorry for the people who quit watching it after eight minutes assuming it was going to be there the whole way and missed out on the rest of what was offered.

My final problem is that it is only provided in 1080i and the audio is not HD audio. I understand this was filmed for television to run on Discovery and that HD television broadcasts in 1080i, but they really could have done this 1080p for the blu-ray.

3478154,5,B001B151X8,"This interesting and informative series from Discovery comes highly recommended. The documentaries chronologically cover the history of NASA from the early Mercury missions, through to Gemini, Apollo, the shuttle launches and beyond, featuring new interviews with most of the key personnel (including a rare appearance from Neil Armstrong).

Although nearly all of the archive footage is grainy and cropped to fit 16:9 widescreen format, the benefit in quality of being transferred to HD is evident and many original films have been included as extras in their original aspect ratio.

The discs are all REGION FREE and can therefore be played anywhere. The only annoying thing is the Discovery Channel commercial which appears every time a disc is loaded, as the song gets on your nerves after a while: ""Boom-de-ah-da, Boom-de-ah-da, Boom-de-ah-da, Boom-de-ah-da!"" AHHHHHHHH!!!!!

If, like me, you're a fan of documentaries and films about space exploration I would also make these recommendations:

- For All Mankind (Forthcoming blu-ray release of an older documentary film about the Apollo missions with all the classic footage not featured in the others)

- The Planets (BBC documentary series about our solar system and the exploration that has helped our understanding of it)

- Apollo 13 (Ron Howard & Tom Hanks' biopic about the unlucky mission)

- From The Earth The The Moon (Tom Hanks' spin-off docu-dramas about the Apollo Moon-landings)

- In The Shadow Of The Moon (Ron Howard-produced documentary film about the Apollo missions, with entertaining comments from Mike Collins who is sadly absent from
the When We Left Earth series)

- The Right Stuff (Classic, if slightly over-long, 1983 film based on Tom Wolfe's bestseller that charts events from breaking the sound barrier to the end of the Mercury program.)",1253664000,5,1825,5.309027777777778
3478155,5,B001B151X8,"""When We Left Earth"" is a very strong effort made by the Discovery Channel, presented here on four DVDs with several hours of bonus footage that was not televised. The set chronicles the United States' spaceflight program from its inception during the cold war, through the International Space Station. The Mercury program gets a lot of attention due to all the ""firsts"" and the extremely high-risk nature of the flights, and, of course, Apollo gets the bulk of attention due to the extremely complex nature of the missions, and the amazing imagery of the lunar flights and landings. I was pleased that while Apollo 11 was featured prominently, that other Apollo missions were also discussed (Apollo 15 got the short shrift). I was happy to see Gemini featured so extensively: it's frequently glossed over despite the critical nature of the work performed in the program, which in large part allowed Apollo to succeed.

The shuttle is featured as well, and no account of the shuttle would be complete without a recounting of the ""Columbia"" and ""Challenger"" disasters, which are discussed candidly. The ISS is also discussed in glowing terms despite its tortuously long, political, and convoluted birth. I was especially pleased with the interviews with astronauts (I greatly enjoyed the interviews with the reclusive Neil Armstrong, the soft-spoken John Young, and the laconic Charlie Duke), engineers, and members of Mission Control (notably Gene Kranz), which are extremely illuminating.

The set is not perfect, and everyone would make changes based on personal preferences, but overall the balance between being a complete historical account of NASA, and selecting the most significant events in manned spaceflight is very good. The price for the set is very reasonable, and I recommend it to anyone, and especially anyone interested in a high quality and succinct overview of NASA history.

As of this writing the future of manned US spaceflight is very much in doubt, and I appreciate the effort that the producers went through to present a balanced, concise history of the space program, emphasizing what is possible when intelligent, dedicated individuals are given a goal and the funding to achieve the goal.",1253404800,3,2217,5.187150837988827

I had read his review before ordering the Blu-Ray version and hoped that I wouldn't feel the same way. I don't agree with his negative comments about the soundtrack but I am in compete agreement about the dirt in the archive video scenes. There is a large blob of dirt that is almost precisely in the middle of the picture for a very large percentage of the archive footage. As he says this was not in the original footage but obviously added during the transfer process. Since this series is about one of the most significant periods in U.S. history, and includes interviews with the real participants, who won't be with us much longer, the problem is a great shame and deserves to be corrected.

I was even more excited when I watched the first DVD - the entire production is thoroughly well done, and I highly recommend this set for the entire family.

Lots of movies nowadays are not geared for the family - most of the time there is too much like violence, cursing and sex that takes away from the viewing experience.

3478166,4,B001B151X8,"I have read six books on the space program in the past three months, basically as part of the excitement I feel for the 40th anniversary celebration of the Apollo program, and the current steps now being taken by NASA to return to the Moon.  I must say, this series vividly brings to life the missions I have been reading about for the past several months, with film footage I have never seen anywhere else.  I think it is the only documentary series out there that tells the whole history of NASA from Mercury to the present, or surely there are no others that do it better.

That being said, I did have some problems with some topics neglected in the series.  While I understand the time constraints of having a six episode series, each episode just under 50 minutes, there were still some glaring omissions in missions and topics.

First, the mission omissions.
1) Apollo 15 was jumped over straight to 16. But 15 was the first use of the lunar rover, and it was the mission that brought back the Genesis Rock, perhaps the oldest lunar sample from all of Apollo.

2) Apollo-Soyuz was not even mentioned, when this was the first international space mission and the one that effectively ended the Space Race and led to the future U.S.-Russian Cooperation now seen with the ISS.

3)Two shuttle flights in particular were passed over--Sally Ride's first flight as the first American woman in space, and John Glenn's return to space aboard Discovery.  These were important milestones in NASA's mission history, if for no other reason than PR.

Beyond neglected missions, there was also neglect in the discussion of the people who worked behind the scenes to make the NASA missions work.  The series focuses almost exclusively on the astronauts, and a couple of important people like Chris Kraft and Gene Krantz.  But there were others who also made the whole program work.  Examples-President Eisenhower, James Killian, James Webb, Wernher Von Braun.  And Deke Slayton, who assigned the crews for the missions from Gemini through Skylab, isn't mentioned again after Mercury.  Yes, the astronauts are the exciting guys to focus on, but these others also deserved mention.

Despite its slight shortcomings mainly caused by its glaring omissions, this series is a must have for space enthusiasts.",1244678400,7,2291,4.883720930232558
3478167,3,B001B151X8,"There are some nice things in this portrait of the U.S. trip through space, but I wanted to point out a couple of flaws I noticed watching these episodes. For one, there's extremely little mention of what the Soviets were doing, especially once we get past Yuri Gagarin being the first man in space. I know this is about the NASA missions, but still, you come away with the impression that NASA was doing everything in space exploration until the USSR broke up and work with the Russians on the space station started. It would be helpful to put these missions in some context by talking more about the Soviets and how the U.S. was trying to keep pace with and move ahead of them in the space race.

More seriously, the music that serves as soundtrack for these episodes is highly dramatic and foreboding: you get the constant feeling that disaster is right around the corner. This takes away from your ability to see the missions as triumphs, discoveries, and landmarks in human history. Instead, you sense the atmosphere of the Challenger and Columbia tragedies looming over the entire NASA history. The music became a real distraction in the later episodes, as I got more and more frustrated by its intrusion into the events being shown on the screen. If you're looking for an analytical, plain-spoken portrait of the full history of space exploration, don't get this set of discs.",1243555200,8,1383,4.738589211618257

3478169,5,B001B151X8,"Originally shown on Discovery last year, this 6 part series was released to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the formation of NASA. The DVD promised extra interviews, mission clips and bonus NASA films, none of which had been shown with the original series. It did not disappoint!

The 6 episodes charting manned spaceflight from Mercury through to the ISS are spread over the first 3 discs. Original footage mixed with interviews from those who were there (and not just the astronauts, but mission control, families etc) makes enjoyable and informative viewing. The narrator, Gary Sinise (Apollo 13; Mission to Mars)is easy to listen to and keeps things moving nicely along.

On each of the three discs are the extra interviews and mission clips, again all enjoyable though the choice of music for the mission clips jarred with me; I'd have preferred something 'of the age' or mission communications but that's just me.

The real gem is disc 4. I've watched a lot of space documentaries over time and this was new footage to me. Born towards the closing months of Gemini, I don't remember anything much before the Shuttle. Watching these films made me feel I was actually there at the time, I caught myself holding my breath on more than one occasion! The featured missions are those of Shepard, Glenn, Gemini 7/6, Apollo 8 and 11.

This DVD will appeal to any one with an interest in the space program, and to more besides as it is easy to watch, and will probably bring back a lot of memories for some whilst being a history lesson to others.

3478180,4,B001B151X8,"Believe it or not I probably know as much if not more then anyone in the general public about the space program then many. I kept up with it continually even during the many ""slack periods"" NASA experienced between the Hubble telescope fiasco (covered here in great detail) all the way up to the initial construction of ISS in the late 90's. Basically this documentary is provides us with some of the most incredible NASA footage ever esembled. Much of it,especially from the Project Mercury-through-moon landing era is quite aged and required special remastering and an incredible job. Also the addition of unseen footage is wonderful and NOT just still photo's as is sometimes the case in the ""brand new footage"" issue. Particularly for me as a huge junkie of the glory days of the space program the extended footage of the Gemini rendevous and and showroom new views of the astronauts riding the lunar rover-made me want to jump into the scene and ride along with them,truly! There were some bits of information from the years I stopped paying rapt attention to NASA's missions,especially the very depressing Columbia disaster. But not to close things over,no matter how many times I see it it's those first space walks,the lunar moduale on landing and taking off from the moon and the astronauts training for those historic mission that truly give me goosebumps. As for my personal review of this DVD that is the positive side of it and it's a lot. The negatives here are actually not as big as I am about to make them sound:keep in mind I am also adding history from my perspective. The Discovery Channel and narrator Gary Sinise seem to be intent on making sure there that everything is presented in the most positive light,especially discussing the early years of the space program. Fact is that even during the moon missions (as discussed on Deke Slayton's brilliant but OOP&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moon-Shot-The-Inside-Story-of-the-Apollo-Project-1994/dp/6303126707/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moon Shot: The Inside Story of the Apollo Project (1994)</a>) the US space program was always putting the cart before the horse in order to meet JFK's innovative (but somewhat short sighted) deadline for the moon landing. That is skimmed over,as is the resulting Apollo 1 disaster. Also much of the 70's in NASA is similarly skimmed over;it tends to make everything look as if between skylab and the first space shuttle test flights in the late 70's nothing happened. For more info on the consequences of Nixon's budget cuts and public backlash at the space program after the Apollo project,look for the probably impossible to find 1988 Lyn Shurr ABC News Closeup ""Beyond The Shuttle"" as well Nova's 1989 ""Space Race"";both don't dwell on the negative as much as one thinks and were made to try to bring a renewed sense of hope,seeing as both were made shortly after the Challenger disaster. That brings to mind the next gap-this time the omission of one of NASA's big triumphs;the 1988 shuttle Discovery mission that put the shuttle program back on track after the Rodgers Commision NASA investigation following Challanger. On VHS I still have incredible,detailed footage of that Discovery flight;it was an amazing launch and mission that deserved inclusion. Also the historical mission of Astronaut Mae Jamison is never mentioned,to say nothing of the controversial but historically important Mercury 13,the often neglected first all female astronaut core who,before the feminist era never made a flight into space. Oh and no Sally Ride? I realize this documentary didn't have the time to cover every detail but at I must point out my reason for deducting a star;the historic Apollo-Soyuz mission that represented an important warm hearted gesture during the cold war,not to mention the ground Deke Slayton's very first (and last) mission into space. I can deal with the space race aspect of NASA's missions barely being covered but to me Apollo-Soyuz was the ideal example of world peace in space in the 70's and a definate show of faith to the naysayers of the time who asked why space travel was so much more important then Earthly social problems-the ANSWER was in Apollo-Soyuz!!!!!Sorry but that is a key emission. But hey;the makers of persian rugs always leave one stitch unsewn so their inventions will not be perfect. Maybe that was why there were so many omissions here,in addition to time constraints. But what is presented here is brilliantly essembled and remastered presentation that should be expanded on to include more on these omissions in the future.

It conveys the politics, the public sentiments, the risks, the excitement, the crew point of view, with a great musical score.  When I watched it on TV, I loved it, and I love it even more having the HD version with my new TV and Blu Ray player.  Sure, plenty of the footage isn't HD, but it's still worth it in my opinion to get the Blu Ray because all the interviews are in HD and the newer footage is spectacular.  They also interspersed some small HD clips in the earlier stuff when it was ok to do so and I believe some of the older footage does actually look a bit better but it's hard to say for sure.  Perhaps the musical score could have been a little less prevalent, but I liked it.

3478196,5,B001B151X8,"Of all the DVD sets out there documenting the history of NASA, I think this one is the best of them (and I've seen them all, I think.)

Firstly, the interviews with the surviving astronauts are wonderful. All of them are human, funny, honest, interesting and have new things to say. Neil Armstrong showing us his dry wit and faux-melodrama recapping was a highlight. How amazing that the doco team was able to bring out that side of his personality we've not seen before from a very shy and introspective man.

Other talking heads are of similar quality, Kranz, Borman especially. The conflict between Kraft and Carpenter is not sugar-coated either. You get both sides and make your own mind up.

Look, it's old footage. The sound isn't consistent. For audio/videophiles this isn't a test set. But it's a great history of the space program which focuses on the men and women involved, and how each step was painstakingly taken with great daring and risk, but also with courage and purpose and vision. That sounds overly sentimental, but to me it was inspiring as many other NASA docs have not been. And there is considerable footage that I hadn't seen before and most of it is amazing quality.

For anyone who wants a capsule of NASA's history, this one will do it. There are other supplemental sets which focus more on engineering aspects, or give you the complete mission reports, but this is an overview from the crews' perspective without getting into detail too deeply.

It's very well-edited, paced nicely and nothing is repeated or duplicated so no wasted time hearing the same old stuff again from somebody else, which happens in the older series.

I loved it. Right to the top of my faves list, up there with From the Earth To the Moon, in fact they make a nice couple - the dramatic re-enactment mini-series, followed by the real guys talking about what actually happened.

3478200,5,B001B151X8,"Although I haven't yet skimmed through the extra footage at all, the content used for the main features was excellent.  Sure there are some flaws in the original media that shows through on the conversion but otherwise it's really excellent.  What I found interesting was when the original footage changes from film to tape the quality of the images actually goes down so in some ways the original mercury shots of launches and the centre are actually better.  This changes back once you get some better shuttle and space station footage.

I couldn't stop watching the series, was done in a couple of nights.  It immediately is out on loan to a sequence of friends with Hi-Def.  4 months to completely re-write a mission and add a spacewalk not planned for a year, our projects these days can't agree on a title of the project for 4 months....

For the most part, the images are surpisingly crisp and stunning, especially when you consider the age of the footage.

3478204,4,B001B151X8,"An exceptional look at the space race and beyond, ""When We Left Earth"" provides us with a glimpse of the stars as seen from the astronauts, engineers and those that helped create the massive space craft that put us up there. Extremely well made, ""When We Left Earth"" covers everything from the early Mercury missions, the snafus that we ran into along the way and the tragedies that also occurred along with the triumphs. What's surprising is that the documentary is fair balanced pointing out when NASA failed or in the case of Challenger that there were known problems with O ring that they were advised against the launch.

The images are often stunning--images of space and much footage that hasn't been seen before in addition to the popular footage of the moon landings, etc. that we've seen. The extras are quite good with a documentary on ""Friendship 7"" and John Glenn's historic flight. We also get featurettes on Skylab, the Gemini missions (including an excerpt from a NASA feature film on the Gemini missions)and interviews.

THis is a terrific set for anybody interested in the history of space flight or even someone who wants to find out about when humanity first stretched its wings and looked beyond the blue sky of our atmosphere.",1224201600,10,1248,4.827102803738318
3478205,3,B001B151X8,"Here's why I like this set:

The image quality is (mostly - see below) very good. Even with the 16mm film source the extra resolution of Blu-Ray is apparent and some of the film is staggeringly effective. As has been stated in another review, the modern interviews are pristine.
The variety and scope of the clips is excellent. The makers have sourced every possible movie from private hands (cine films) and NASA and there's a great deal I've not seen despite 40 years of interest in the subject.
The narration is well written and appropriate. This feels like a story with narrative rather than a straightforward documentary.

Here's why I dislike this set and think it's a wasted opportunity:

Despite the quality of the film clips there are some that have clear and very obvious visible and not just minor anomalies but persistent great big black blobs in the same place on the screen. This 'dirt' persists across clips taken at varied times, even months apart and in very different locations, so it wasn't on the original film. That means, logically, that it's a projection fault and that it wasn't spotted during the HD transfer to Blu-Ray. that's VERY disappointing.
More importantly there's the issue of the music. I'm British and (until recently) our TV documentaries used the original audio soundtrack alone rather than additional music. If music was used then it was sparingly and appropriate and it certainly didn't get in the way of the original audio. During this presentation the music is near permanent. It never stops except for a few seconds here and there. It drowns out narration and more importantly it all but removes the original audio. Subtitles are provided for capcom recordings (voices to and from the spacecraft) but they wouldn't be needed if the infernal music would just shut up! Not only that but the music isn't of good quality and is stupidly over-blown, false drama in every moment. The scenes are dramatic enough, leave them alone please. In the extras there are standalone clips of the astronauts training (etc) and I though at least with these there'd be the original audio but no, the music is even worse and there's NO original audio at all. Shameful. I realize that this is the norm for American TV documentaries (Nothing personal, you make the best TV in the world on the whole) but it ruins the experience and should be resisted.

So, a very very good set partially spoiled by the music and some transfer anomalies. If you can cope with the music then don't let the anomalies put you off. It's probably the best NASA footage on Blu-Ray so far but it could have been the best full stop.",1224028800,281,2627,4.767032967032967
3478206,5,B001B151X8,"This is an excellent documentary about the history of space flight.
Even though most of the actual footage is not HD (all interviews seem to be as well as some shuttle footage), it's really enjoyable and very interesting.
It covers all the stages , Mercury, Gemini , Apollo, Skylab, the Shuttle and the International Space Station.  It also offers some insight into the unfortunate Challenger and Columbia accidents.
Highly recommended for those interested in space exploration, not so much for those looking for the ultimate ultra-sharp images on BD.",1223856000,13,551,5.191011235955056
3478207,5,B001B151X8,"WHEN WE LEFT EARTH - THE NASA MISSIONS (BLU-RAY) is a very fine four disc DVD set that documents the entire US manned space effort including: the X-15 Program, Projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, the Skylab Space Station, the Shuttle, the Hubble Telescope repair and upgrade mission and the ongoing joint International Space Station program. The quality, scope and modest price make this DVD an excellent buy.

It featured excellent beautifully edited footage, great music, interesting and informative narratives provided by NASA technical staff, and covers virtually every major step of the American manned space effort.  This film includes some of the most beautifully recorded sequences I have ever watched on Blu-Ray. Especially good was the job of editing and assembling the many visual sequences. I believe the editors made an effort to mix in high definition footage with low so as to really highlight the difference.  NASA astronauts and flight controllers provided the narratives where they had some direct involvement in the sequence.

Spacecraft Films has also produced some excellent and comprehensive productions by offering official footage from the National Archives, US Air Force, and NASA digitally enhanced. However, this collection by the Discovery Channel was superior in every way to anything I have watched to date. I was not dissapointed with this fine feature and feel that every armchair astronaut will enjoy this great DVD available from Amazon for under $40.",1223683200,14,1486,5.364806866952789

This is a must have for every space history buff.  There's so much footage I've never seen before.  And that doesn't include the hours of NASA films from the era.

There are only two issues I have that keep this from being a five-star review.  I'd really give it a 4.5.

1) There's the ""Boom de ya da"" ad for the Discovery Channel that goes on at the start of every disc you cannot skip.

2) The music, while good, gets repetitive and bombastic after a while.",1223683200,11,601,4.4
3478209,5,B001B151X8,"The six hour-long episodes include:

ORDINARY SUPERMAN
NASA selects seven men to become the first astronauts. They're all test pilots, prepared to risk their lives. No one has ever survived a vertical launch on top of a rocket, but it's the only way they know to put an astronaut into earth orbit. The Mercury astronauts and engineers need to figure out how to launch a man into space on top of a converted intercontinental ballistic missile.

FRIENDS AND RIVALS
For Project Gemini, a new generation of astronauts arrive at NASA -- their mission, to test all the procedures required to land men on the moon and bring them safely back to earth. Each Gemini mission launches two men into space, leading to some of NASA's greatest moments -- Ed White's spacewalk, the first orbital rendezvous of Gemini 6 and 7.

LANDING THE EAGLE
The Apollo program is set to achieve the ultimate prize of the Space Race, landing men on the moon. But a fire breaks out in the pressurized capsule of Apollo 1, resulting in the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. But NASA's astronauts and engineers turn tragedy into triumph with the first manned launch of the formidable Saturn V rocket, lifting three astronauts into deep space for the first time. Two missions later and NASA is ready to land men on the moon in the ultimate test of America's spacefaring vision.

THE EXPLORERS
Now that NASA has mastered the lunar round trip, they want to explore more of the moon's mysteries. With Apollo 13, they face their biggest crisis in space -- returning a damaged spacecraft back safely to earth. Undaunted, NASA launches more moon missions and a new lunar rover that allows wide-ranging lunar surface expiditions. Apollo 17 is the longest moon mission and the last time man would set foot on the moon for generations. In a new phase of the space program, NASA converts an unused Saturn V rocket into Skylab, America's first space-station. But by the time it reaches orbit it's badly damaged. For the first time, astronauts will have to work outside the spaceship to save the space-station.

THE SHUTTLE
For its first 20 years, NASA launches capsules carrying a maximum of three people. But new requirements for a bigger cargo bay prompt a breakthrough in spacecraft design. The development of the reusable shuttle leads to a revolutionary approach to space travel, but somebody has to test fly it in space for the first time. That requires a true test pilot, John Young, the man who sat alongside Gus Grissom on the first Gemini flight. NASA's manned programs are again leading the way, but space travel remains as dangerous as ever and tragedy again strikes NASA when the Challenger explodes.

HOME IN SPACE
One of the most complex instruments ever built, the Hubble Space Telescope is expected to transform our understanding of the Universe. But once it is in orbit, NASA discovers a serious problem, a defective main mirror that leaves Hubble short-sighted. NASA sends a team of astronauts to fix the problem, but it won't be easy. It is NASA's greatest and highest profile mission since the Apollo era. It gives NASA the confidence to begin construction on the International Space Station. More astronauts are in space simultaneously than ever before. And despite the tragedy of Columbia, NASA's astronauts are pioneering the way back to the moon, Mars and beyond.",1222732800,45,3360,4.865384615384615

The early films have been enhanced and are visually stunning, especially the incredible Saturn V rocket footage.

3478211,5,B001B151X8,"This is a collection of many of NASA mission documentation, such as photos and films, with the verbal comments of the astronauts that flew them. It covers all the major space flights, starting with the X-15 and Mercury, and ends with the latest Shuttle mission to the International Space Station. It also includes very rare interviews with astronauts that are not seen publicly but were part of NASA's history. My favorites were Neil Armstrong on the X-15 and John Young on the Columbia Space Shuttle.

As with most NASA documentaries, there are some misplaced films placed during certain events. The most famous of these were the Saturn V stagings scenes, where the second stage separation was actually part of Apollo 4 (the first Saturn V launch in November 1967), and the third stage separation which is really the Saturn 1B staging. Only real space nuts, like me, would recognize them.

Not considering these and other technical details, which added plenty to the action scenes, the story in each chapter is easy to follow from the beginning to the end. I saw these chapters first on the Discovery/Science Channel, and I like the DVD version, too, which naturally has no commercial intermissions. For those who only saw the broadcast version of the space missions, this will actually be more entertaining and satisfying to watch. And for those history buffs like me, who collect as much as possible before the NASA films degrade, this is a complete and quite accurate effort from the Discovery Channel, and probably the only place where you can listen to most of the original astronauts who flew these missions and who are still with us on Earth.

As for me, I wish that The Discovery Channel would also release the six ""Moon Machines"" chapters which covers the Apollo missions in much more detail, but with interviews and comments from the engineers and scientists who developed the spacecraft, navigation, and space suits that got us to the Moon. This would be a very satisfying addition to my collection and a recommendation to sell together with the other NASA videos here at Amazon.",1220659200,6,2091,4.901129943502825
