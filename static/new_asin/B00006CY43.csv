7967252,4,B00006CY43,"The first episodes of the series are very cool. It's an old anime but with an excellent level of humor, ecchi, animation and an OK plot. I recommend it.",1326672000,,152,4.275862068965517
7967253,4,B00006CY43,"I'm not sure how many US anime watchers are familiar with the term 'fan service,' which the Japanese use for anime that specializes in the vaguely prurient.  Nubile bodies, plenty of jiggle, and a sense of humor that hovers between salacious and downright bawdy.  This isn't really pornography, but skates a thin line, and if done well, can be quite entertaining.

Burn Up Excess almost makes fan service into an art form.  Set in the same Neo Tokyo that has served as the setting for some very serious anime, this series follows the adventures of the Warrior team, all young, buxom ladies who switch between underwear scenes and police shoot'em-ups without a blink.  One is always broke, another is a gun freak, and there is even one male to act as a foil.  Together, they take on criminals, terrorists, and estranged fathers.

Seriously, this is a better series than it sounds - a lot of lighthearted humor and well done action to remind us that not every anime is either romantic or dire, or both.  If you are likely to be offended by the horseplay, then pass this by, but the average American film is no better, and often has less of a story line.",1115769600,6,1151,4.580487804878048
7967254,5,B00006CY43,"By far the most enjoyable incarnation of Burn Up.  If you were let down by the amazingly bad wrap up of the Burn Up W series, don't shy away from Excess.  No previous knowledge of the Burn Up universe is required, but it certainly doesn't hurt.  The storyline from Burn Up W continues into Excess, but-- again, no previous knowledge is required.
The animation is excellent.  Flawless.  Spectacular direction and execution.  Character designs have been tweaked and the series has a much more ""serious"" feel to it.  If you think you'll miss the silly humor of the Burn Up W episodes, you may want to try before you buy.
As for the rest of us... Excess is dead-on.  A very strong set of episodes.  Extras are solid.  The Jiggle Counter is not always accurate, but we could argue all day. ;)
Oh yeah, and if you like fan service, you just can't go wrong!",1041120000,9,850,4.461038961038961
7967255,4,B00006CY43,"After two to three years of letting the license for this anime sit on the shelf, ADV Films has finally decided to reenact this anime for US commerical release!
Generally, a person would not watch an anime like Burn-Up Excess for any sort of educational value whatsoever. It does not have heart-wrenching drama or a stunning story that makes you sit up and say ""Wow!"" Rather, a person would watch this if you needed something to laugh at. And Burn Up Excess provides lots to laugh about.
Enter Rio, the foremost character of Burn Up Excess (and the one you see on the front cover.) She's broke, she overspends, and her answering machine is loaded with messages from various bill collectors. To pay all this, she works at Policetown HQ. However, what's special about her (or her job, at least) is that she belongs to Team Warrior.
Team Warrior is a small elite crime squad that serves as a police special operations unit. Along with Rio in this unit are Maya, a green haired gun maniac, Yuji, a driver/pilot of all vehicles and part-time pervert, Nanvel, the mechanical genius, Lilica, the hyper computer hacker, and Maki, their boss, who is always cool and collected. Together, they face off against the many terrorist who would dare to take on the law, or Maya's big gun, or Rio's special-issue police baton, whichever is convenient.
Ladies might not be as appreciative of this series as most gentlemen would be. This series is absolutely loaded with ""fan service,"" or raw appeal for men. There is much suggested nudity (nothing concrete), as well as four of the five Warrior ladies have huge chest that will definitely lead to back strain later in their lives. Added to this is ADV Film's patented Jiggle Counter, an extra that can be set to show how many times the breasts of the Warrior ladies bounce during the DVD. This show was obviously created with the male fan in mind.
So, if you feel you are in need of some laughs, then pick up this popular comedy/action anime, as there's a lot of fighting and loads of humor to be served up!",1035849600,11,2038,4.632596685082873
7967256,5,B00006CY43,"Burn Up Excess is a great series.  I enjoyed this disc very much, it was much better than I expected.  The characters are all great, especially the machine gun crazy Maya.  Granted this is a cliche anime.  Pretty girls with big guns but it works.  In my opinion it is worth every penny you spend for it and I can't wait for the rest of the series to be released.",1035158400,3,362,4.114285714285714
7967257,5,B00006CY43,"Team Warrior is back again in the new series Burn Up Excess.  To start off, this is not a continueation of Burn Up Warrior.  This is a whole new series.  It is all around a great series, with just the right amount of action, comedy, guns, and girls to make it almost perfect.  The characters are still the same as in Warrior, Rio with her money problems, Lillica with her techno junk, Maya with her fire arms obsession, and Yuji with his love for Rio and all around stupidity ...  So if you like girls, guns, and a little humor ...Burn Up Excess if the show for you.",1030838400,2,566,4.203703703703703
