8573107,4,B00BRI96FO,"Eye-opening for me. Very informative, in ways I expected and ways I did not. ""Road To Fallujah"" tells the story from both sides of the conflict in Iraq ( The November 2004 battle) and offers non-violent solutions to war.",1369353600,2,220,4.666666666666667
8573108,5,B00BRI96FO,"Offers an eye-witness account at the war on terror from the eyes of those living in Fallujah. Despite all the obvious violence and terror, this film promotes acts of non-violence and peace for the future. In a time where a lot of people shield themselves from unpleasant  worldly news, this film tells an informative tale of what has happened but also gives hope. Highly recommended!",1369353600,,383,4.892307692307693
