Some of the movies in here you won't believe.  This is like Mystery Science Theatre on smack!  I laughed my o-ring clean off!",1089331200,6,327,4.383333333333334
2050116,1,B0001ZZ4O6,At first I thought it was a movie about my Amazon Prime watch list.  Since all I get from Amazon is garbage movies to choose from.  It's getting to the point this service isn't worth even the $10 price tag.  I search day after day and can't find anything to watch.  This movie is a prime (forgive the pun) example of what's on offer.  The occasional show like Bosch doesn't make up for the avalanche of crap assaulting our optic nerves.

2050119,3,B0001ZZ4O6,"Not an altogether horrible list of choices, but the ranking is bogus.  ""Mesa of Lost Women"" should be No. 1, and here it is, incredibly, ranked in the forties.  I submit that Ron Ormond is far more deserving of the top ranking, because he chose to not only confuse moviegoers with a flashback within a flashback, but also drive into an insane rage with his use of repetitive and incredibly incongruous flamenco music.  ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures..."" , OTOH, ranked No. 1 here, is a far more entertaining movie and has much better music, as well has a lot of nice dancing girls, even if the monsters are cheap and cheesy.

Note: ""Troll"" is mistitled, the movie they are showing clips from here is actually ""Troll 2"".

Still an enjoyable if questionable list of the worst. They would have done better making two parts of this and have 25 an episode and doubled the length.

The narrator isn't too bad. He is a bit persnickety. They really don't come out and tell you why it's bad but let you think for yourself why. I had more fun talking to my ex when she was here about it than I do watching it alone now.

Most of these probably ended up on that mystery science 3000 show. I believe it was called.

I love the it's so bad it's good types of movies. I wish to warn that there is some nudity in the clips so take that into consideration if younger audiences might watch.

Admittedly, any analysis would double or perhaps triple the running time, and I guess the producers didn't want to tax anyone's patience.

Second, why turn nasty about Peter Graves' acting? There was no reason to single him out and he was fine in an awful flick. Perhaps Graves didn't sign Larkin's autograph book?

And while most of the films here are dead on, I don't know anybody who would put Spider Baby on a worst list. It's terrific. Odd, but terrific.

I have to say that while I was certainly entertained, I was sort of disappointed by some of the films included in the list. I'm sure that these might be very bad for the people who made the list, but I have to question some of the films that made the list. Howard the Duck is a bad movie but is it really worse than The Final Sacrifice, which wasn't included on the list? My point is that this list seems to be more based on (as another reviewer stated) box office gross & personal preference than actual badness.

There have been so many awful movies in the history of cinema and this program barely touches on a few of them. I question the judgment of attempting to review 50 movies in 60 minutes, especially when for half of them, the narrator describes them simply as ""bad"" or ""very bad"", or ""very very bad."" Not to mention, the videos appear to be stock trailers for the movies, rather than any particular movie footage.

Also, who decided which movies were the worst? This program seems to be the results of some undisclosed poll. I'm noticing a strange absence of ""Manos"". They probably just couldn't get a trailer for it, so they left it off of the list.

One more thing, besides the questionable choice of movies and annoyingly lazy narration, the viewer is treated to a poor computer animation of a movie audience booing and throwing clip-art food at the screen before EVERY one of the 50 entries. Annoying.

Given that proclivity, you would think that this DVD would be perfect for me, but I came away unenthusiastic. Don't misunderstand me: there are 50 wretched movies discussed here, but the presentation is cheap, the commentary is middling at best, and the films selected, while definitely poor, are most certainly not the worst 50 films in history.

Obviously any grouping like this is somewhat arbitrary and subjective, but many of these films (e.g. the German version of ""Snow White"" from 1955) are outclassed in stupefying badness by many other films. Many of the films here are known by virtually everyone interested in B-movies (""Ishtar,"" ""Howard the Duck,"" ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,"" etc.), although some of the films were unknown to me, and for that alone I am giving this DVD three stars. Great films like ""Firebird 2015 AD,"" ""The Great Alligator,"" and ""The Three Stooges in Orbit"" (simply ghastly) are presented here in all their ""glory. For that the DVD can be praised.

Understand that the DVD is 60 minutes long, and features 50 films, so there is not much time devoted to each, and the repetitive linking feature of animated objects being hurled at a movie screen got very old very fast. I have mixed feelings about this project and considered grades of one, two, or three stars, but finally settled on three due to the relatively high number of wretched cinematic morsels that the DVD introduced me to. The concept is good, but the selection of films is questionable, and the execution leaves a lot to be desired. I would find a copy of ""The Golden Turkey Awards"" by the Medved brothers and use it as a guide before recommending this DVD. If you have exhaustively researched all other outlets of cinematic cheesiness, then by all means go ahead and buy this, it's cheap.

Frankly, if this was just a trailer reel, I'd highly recommend it, but it's edited together like any one of the endless VH1 shows of similar title. The only thing missing is the ""funny"" pundits waxing poetically on the subject at hand.

2050213,1,B0001ZZ4O6,"I love bad movies, so when i saw there was a documentary out all about ranking the worst movies i thought i'd give it a try.

Don't bother with this DVD.  Its 60 minutes long.  Now think about that fact. 50 movies, in 60 minutes. Some movies are barely shown for twenty seconds or they use a commercial that reveals little of whats bad in the movie.  SO problem number one they don't show enough of the movies.  Problem 2 is the bad designs of people booing and throwing popcorn at every movie they talk about.  The voice over was also a bit on the annoying side but thats probably the fault of the people who made this.

Its actually very ironic that this being about the worst films is actually a terrible film in itself. Another complaint i have is on what merrits on they ranking these films.  FOr a few, it seemed they put their not cause they were the worst movies made but because they were box office flops. I'm not saying Ishtar or Howard the duck were good movies but they shouldn't be placed on a list of the worst.  There are alot more terrible films, with acting thats unbelievably bad, mistakes galore, poor lighting, poor directing, poor writing,etc.  These were just bad movies that were flops.  I'm surprised they didn't throw Heaven's gate in here if they were doing flops.

So i don't get the criteria they were using.  A lot of really terrible movies were excluded too for some reason.  Manos is sadly missing.  Glen or Glenda is alot worse then Plan 9(despite plan 9 having the fame) yet plan 9 got a lower ranking.

I guess the best thing i can say about this DVD is that they did get a list of some very bad movies.  Robot Monster and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians are amongst the worst movies you'll ever see.  According to the DVD, only Black Belt Jones is a movie so bad its funny but many (If not all) picked are so bad they are funny.  I didn't like how they included the movie Troll only because the sequel Troll 2 was so much worse(For heaven's sake, Troll 2 didn't even have trolls in it.  it had Goblins.  Thats bad!).

So, if you guys want to Watch a List of movies with barely any clips of the films that emphasize there baddness, this a film for you.  those of you who don't, heres a breif list of some of their movies.

Certainly far from a definitive list of Worst movies",1128124800,82,3601,4.534591194968553

8019314,1,B0001ZZ4O6,"It must be just 1 person's idea of what was 'worst',because there are a lot of movies worse than many of the ones listed.",1524700800,,121,4.083333333333333
8019315,1,B0001ZZ4O6,So this is pointless...just an awfully narrated list with info from the film previews.  Shamelessly terrible as any of the movies on it's own list.,1524528000,,147,4.88
8019316,2,B0001ZZ4O6,Most of the list is movies that are in black and white. A lot of the reasons are not valid. It is talking about bad suits or bad props but back when they were made these things were still in the beginning stages of creation. Now we have so many great special effects they shouldn't diss old stuff due to that. My issue is no one really knows these movies that are in their 30's or younger for example. I knew about 3 on the list and I'm in my 40's. I can name MANY more current day movies and movies from the 80s & 90s that were horrible they imply these are the only bad movies ever. It really is a case of opinion too.,1523232000,,620,3.9285714285714284
8019317,1,B0001ZZ4O6,This movie belongs on its own list. The narrator is the worst.,1522972800,,62,4.25
8019318,3,B0001ZZ4O6,"If you have a fondness for ""so bad they're good"" movies, this is an o.k. way to get a quick-moving trip down memory lane, but it will not please everyone.  . As other reviewers have said, there is minimal dialog providing context for each movie, but there is enough here to make it somewhat interesting.

Some movies that often appear on the ""Worst of All Time"" lists are here, plus many you probably have never heard of.  My all-time favorites include ""The Creeping Terror"" (#42), ""Robot Monster"" (#33), ""Bride of the Monster"" (#29), and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (#4).  However I don't feel that ""The Trial Of Billy Jack"" (#17) belonged on this list - there are far worse movies than those.  Like, where's ""Frogs""?  ""Battlefield Earth""?  ""The Incredible Two-Headed Transplant""?  ""The Beast Of Yucca Flats""?  ""Manos...""?  I can think of more, but you get the idea.

Overall if you like the ""Top 10"" style lists by WatchMojo on You Tube, you will appreciate the overall style here, which means:
A)  It moves quickly,
B)  Some movies get inadequate attention, and
C)  You will not agree with some, or even most of the choices.

I did fast-forward through some movie segments that i had no interest in, which is also an option to cut down on boredom.

A word of warning though:  This film contains some disturbing scenes plus some gore and sexual content in some segments.  Proceed with caution.",1522972800,,1393,4.70954356846473

8019322,5,B0001ZZ4O6,It tells you why the movie is on the list and shows you clips to back that up. Pretty funny. It moves along at a good pace as well. I don't know why people are being so hard on this movie. Maybe they do not appreciate grade Z films.,1522540800,,232,3.7551020408163267
