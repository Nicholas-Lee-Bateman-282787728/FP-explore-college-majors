7554565,5,B018TKI4RS,Still the best after all these years. you can't go wrong with Snoopy and the gang.,1461628800,,82,4.1875
7554566,5,B018TKI4RS,We got this to watch with the kids. Secretly though I wanted to watch them after seeing most of these when I was a child. They are still as great as they were then and having them all in one set is a bonus. Quality of the movies was good but you can tell they haven't been enhanced (nor should they in my opinion).,1461196800,4,314,3.921875

7554572,5,B018TKI4RS,"Paramount has finally done something that used to be impossible for many years; putting all 4 original Peanuts movies in 1 DVD set! This is a 4-in-1 reissue of the earlier DVD releases on their own, all in 1 normal-sized DVD case! Despite their being in Faux-Widescreen compared to much earlier VHS and TV prints, this'll still make a great companion to the WB's Peanuts decade sets, even the Emmy-Honored Collection which has most of the half-hour Peanuts specials of the 1980's! Thanks, Paramount, for finally answering Peanuts fans' wishes for this all-in-1-set, after all these years, even if all 4 movies are in Faux-Widescreen, as they were originally filmed in Fullscreen, as the real videotapes and old TV prints on homemade videotapes prove! Good Grief, what an unheard-of collection of, what used to be, Peanuts rarities!",1453248000,16,831,5.072992700729927
7554573,5,B018TKI4RS,Fun collection! Good price,1519948800,,26,5.75
7554574,5,B018TKI4RS,"As a kid in the 80s, I very much enjoyed renting the classic Peanuts feature films (A Boy Named Charlie Brown, Snoopy Come Home, Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown) on VHS from my local library...while the first two films made it to DVD in 2006, it took nearly a decade before Paramount followed suit with the last two in 2015, so for those of you who love these animated treasures as much as I do, this set is a great value for the price and the memories therein:

- ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"" is the same extended cut from the 2006 release, featuring scenes which were deleted/trimmed sometime after the film's 1969 premiere
- While neither Snoopy Come Home nor Race For Your Life contain any bonus material, both have excellent audio/visual quality (as do the other 2 films)
- Bon Voyage also includes the original theatrical trailer, plus 2 new documentaries on the making of the film

So if you're a diehard Peanuts fan looking to snatch up all 4 classic films on DVD at a reasonable price, this is the set for you!",1518393600,,1050,4.463541666666667

7554590,5,B018TKI4RS,"A great addition to my growing Peanuts collection.  I remember seeing these once or twice as a kid, so they were vaguely familar to me.  Now I can watch them any time I want.  My 7 an 10 year olds are enjoying them as well. If you are a collector (and haven't got the 60s & 70s collections) I highly recommend these.",1488758400,3,316,4.064516129032258

7554597,4,B018TKI4RS,"My four-year-old is a bit sensitive to all these PG rated movies they're making for kids now days. Mostly, because someone is eventually in jeopardy at some point in the movie. These peanuts movie ks are lovely because they're all G rated  and he's much more comfortable with them than so many contemporary kid flicks.

A slight word of caution though, the 70s and 80s sensibility leaned a bit more towards one on one ""whack a mole"" type violence. Think Tom and Jerry and the like.  Regardless, they still retain great charm and sweetness.",1485561600,,539,4.712765957446808
7554598,5,B018TKI4RS,"We bought two of these for two of our grandchildren, and they have both watched it over and over.  I remember watching these years ago, and I still like them, too.  They are really classic cartoons with some good messages for kids.",1485302400,,231,4.476190476190476

7554606,5,B018TKI4RS,I grew up watching these as TV specials around the various holidays that the networks liked to re-run them and I'm very happy to finally have them in a set.
