900367,5,6304600402,"In 1995 while reading the New York Times I saw a review for a movie called Zero Kelvin. I think more out of curiosity about the name I began to read it. Kelvin is a temperature scale whose ""zero"" equals -271 celsius. An allusion to the world in which the story takes place. Set in Greenland, it is the story of 3 men and the forces both from their pasts and from within which collide in a squalid hunting cabin by the sea. Stellan Skarsgard is the ""foreman"" of the group and they are charged with doubling the previous season's pelt quota. The two experienced men are joined by a writer who hires on for the experience, but does not count on the realities he finds there. The realities not just of the environment, but also of drunkenness, brutality, his own character flaws and the near edge of madness at which the leader of the group is poised.
A bit of a punk, and unable to forgive perceived wrongs - Larsen, the writer - refuses the opportunities he's given to make peace with the other two men and the anger and mutual retributions are explosive. Finally, their passions lead to all out war with tragic and final results. This has been billed as the thinking man's adventure, which it certainly is. There is psychological and gut-level tension here, finely acted by this ensemble cast. If Jack London or Hemingway suit your tastes, then this fine film will not disappoint. - JK -",1032220800,4,1386,4.503968253968254
900368,3,6304600402,"First off, a movie being filmed in the Svalbard archipelago of arctic Norway (though SET in East Greenland) captured my attention to watch this movie for Svalbard is one of my favourite travel destinations.  I find that this movie has a good story-line, however, for animal-lovers, this might not be the film for you.  It's based on a small fur-trading station in East Greenland where only sources of food are through hunting...and perhaps, of course, their job there is to kill wildlife...as simple as that.  Hunting wildlife has never been my thing and I am an animal-lover, that is why I didn't really like this movie much (but what I did I expect eh), though interesting, showing how the 3 men stuck in a small cabin cut off from the rest of the world, but at the same time, not being able to get along with each other.
Overall, the movie was okay...just the fact of trapping and killing animals hit my weak points (though of course I knew thats what this movie is about).  But I wouldn't say I regret seeing it...",1026086400,2,1018,4.546448087431694
900369,4,6304600402,"A tough, tense, psychological thriller set in the bleak, frozen  wilds of Greenland.
A young writer leaves Oslo and his girlfriend behind and joins a fur-trapping expedition that includes two mysterious men.  Cut off from civilization, the once naive youth must use all his wits to survive the elements and a savage human enemy.
A rare, thoughtful adventure in an extreme setting starring the great Scandanavian actor Stellen Skarsgard.
Directed by Hans Moland from a screenplay by Lars Lundholm.
Visually stunning and mentally engaging.  Highly recommended.
One UK reviewer (Bernard in THE DAILY MAIL) said it was ""a Norse version of 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly.'""
Hard core Arctic adventure that goes all the way.

900464,1,6304600402,"I did not watch this movie after I searched for a way to change the language to English and could not find a way to do that.
I really think it is important to have that in the title information that it is not in English and has to be watched with subtitles.
That is if customer service is important anyway.",1394236800,,306,4.032786885245901

900468,2,6304600402,"Saw the film yesterday. Thought it would be a kind of adventurous trapper-film. It isn't. It's a nervewrecking psychotrip. You won't stop for almost 2 hours wishing for Randtaeds (one of the trapper) death. Hard to stand through the film. I wouldn't recommend it for adventure-film-freaks. Frankly it's boring. Still it's not a ""bad"" film. But I bet: noone ever saw that film twice. One time is more than enough. We're all happy... very happy, that Randstaed finally died. What an idiot. Oh my god.",1290470400,,498,4.870588235294117
900469,5,6304600402,"This film has a relatively limited cast - for the bulk of the film there are only three characters. The essence of the film is how these three characters interact when forced to live together in Greenland. Two are fur trappers who are jaded to the arctic, and have interesting, and somewhat peculiar backgrounds. The third is a writer from Oslo seeking to gain experience for his writing.

Slowly the misalignments of character traits grows, and the tension builds. It is a wonderful study of how vastly different backgrounds and personalities can drive people to extremes that one would not otherwise expect.

Over all of this is the magnificent sweeping grandeur of Greenland. Possibly a film better suited to the big screen (where I saw it), but it being so unlikely that you'll get the chance, you may as well reward yourself with the DVD.",1289001600,,843,4.8068965517241375
900470,1,6304600402,"I saw this movie at the Seattle International Film Festival, and I was embarrassed to be a Norwegian watching this Norwegian film.  The dialog consisted of 90 percent swear words, worse than I ever heard in the Army. I had called earlier to ask if this was a family film, and the SIFF lady said ""Yes, of course!"". So I took my folks, my brothers and sisters, and my aunt and uncle visiting from Montana.  My uncle arrived at the early scene where a woman strips naked, and he turned around and walked out.  The rest of us sat there stunned, unbelieving the garbage we were watching.  I thought it would get better as the movie progressed, but no luck. We should have walked out.  I would expect this to be enjoyed only by the most jaded sadist.  Altogether disgusting.",1190851200,5,768,4.45

900472,4,6304600402,"Moller scores extremely high points once again with Zero Kelvin. Although the movie is supposed to take place in remote, brutal Greenland, the movie was actually shot in remote, brutal Svalbard, Norway.
Moller is particularly adept and assembling, perfectly managing , and directing exceptional actors. Skarsgard is more than first rate as the menacing, moody, sociopathic, and vicious Randbaek. This is certainly a departure from some of Skarsgard's more well known characters, and this role demonstrates his range and amazing abilities to present a multitude of characters in vastly different circumstances.
Gard Eidsvold is superb as a relatively innocent and decent man who is plunged into harsh reality and forced to adapt to survive. His character represents truth, decency, and love, but also represents what men are capable of in dire and seemingly hopeless circumstances where evil rules and goodness is fleeting.
Bjorn Sundquist, one of Norway's best actors, is great as the analytical, no nonsense, experienced scientist. He functions as the mediator between Skarsgard's and Eidsvold's contrasts, but is himself forced to take drastic measures in extreme circumstances.
This is a great film which combines extreme psychological contrasts and contradictions, beautifully filmed landscapes, and the brutal reality of sub zero temperatures where basic survival is the goal. In short, it is a harrowing game of psychological and physical survival with a lot of twists and surprises. Some of the hunting scenes, particularly the scene involving a nasty walrus, are amazing. The sledding with teams of amazingly stout and rugged sled dogs in extremely dangerous and perilous conditions are perhaps unprecedented.
I gave the movie 4 stars for a few reasons. First, although sled dogs and animals are a commodity in the brutal world of the North, I thought the cruelty was a bit overdone. I think a few scenes could've been eliminated. I'm not an animal rights activist, but once again, just a few scenes should've been left out. Second, Skarsgard's performance is tremendous, but I also thought the production went a little too far with some of Randbaek's violent and sexual rantings. We got the point that Randbaek was a vicious, disturbed sociopath, and the character was developed quite well, but we didn't need to have it reiterated all the time.",1075852800,13,2354,5.313672922252011

7874467,1,6304600402,"I honestly did not last more than the first 30 minutes of this film, simply because it's (IMO, folks) crap.  Deep psychological insights?  Spare me.  Exploration of motive off set by dribbling idiots, present and accounted for. . In reality, of course, the filmmakers did not abuse or torture any of the animals shown.  So that's a plus. However, even that tiny grain of awareness does not redeem this film.  The plot is mediocre, at best. Week acting kills the concept of last man standing themes.  I will say the cinematography is splendid, even though bleak and foreboding. If you have ever viewed the ice cap for yourself, you already know what global looks like, up close and personal.  I had that pleasure during a cruise to and from Alaska.  Yes, it can raise awareness. But you have to look for the spirit that drives the story. It just isn't there.
So from my elevated post, I think the only saving grace of this garbage was that I viewed it on Prime, so no charge. That is the only reason, Prime.  Otherwise, I would have passed. Ugh.",1430006400,,1044,4.540106951871658
