8713089,4,B00WFHTYEO,"Very good DVD, nice to see a different area covered. Great match ups and a ton of matches. Lawler in Hawaii is different and great. Also a load of stars.",1452902400,,153,4.133333333333334
8713090,1,B00WFHTYEO,Garbage video quality.  Looks like someone just downloaded a bunch of bootleg YouTube videos and burned them to a disc.  Some of the footage is even in the wrong aspect ratio (i.e. widescreen).  Probably the worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon to date.,1451520000,,257,4.666666666666667
