7673661,5,B01CDT6374,"I actually bought this season directly from the WBSHOP. I love this series and am so glad that they made season 6! Yes, the sound is bad on this one, but I don't care if I have to read lips! Loved this show, not only is it free from most of the things on tv today i love to see the old outfits, and classic cars! Yes, my family laughs and I do not care one bit! This show was showing a time when people did not want to talk about hot issues, they do today but do not do anything about them. Love the acting, at times over acting in this show. You are really missing out if you skip this one!",1461196800,,591,3.813008130081301
7673662,1,B01CDT6374,"Sub-standard viewing quality.  For the price it should be top notch.  It has the quality of a video tape from the 70's, not at all DVD quality.  It's difficult to enjoy the episodes because the screen flaws are so distracting.  And the audio is like someone used a toilet paper cardboard core as a microphone.

So unimpressed after waiting so long.  Seasons 1 through 5 were stellar in every way.  This season is so poor I can't really bring myself to sit through all the episodes.",1461024000,,481,4.523255813953488
7673663,5,B01CDT6374,Love it as do my other seasons,1460937600,,30,3.4285714285714284
7673664,5,B01CDT6374,"I loved this series when I was in Junior High School through High School. When they came out with the first season I bought it to see if I would still love it or if I would find it dated. I think I love it more. I was a Candy Striper back then .... yes with the peppermint pinifore and little striped nurses cap, and when I watch this show once and awhile they have a Candy Striper in the background and it just makes me grin. I have all 6 seasons and I was surprised how much I still enjoy the show. Sometimes I see the old shows from my childhood and can't believe I didn't go wacky with the laugh track in the background but this series was done very well.",1460764800,2,659,3.962406015037594
7673665,4,B01CDT6374,"Just love this series. I don't care how old it is. Great stories with moral complications. Only
reason for 4 stars is that the series was not remastered!",1460246400,,153,4.5
7673666,5,B01CDT6374,"Nothing wrong with Medical Center. Dated in technology since I am in the medical profession, but the plots are great and fun to see old tech.",1459555200,4,141,4.461538461538462
7673667,5,B01CDT6374,"I can't seem to get enough of this show. Being 44 years old, I missed this the first time around, but I'm thrilled to have found it on dvd. To the everlasting amusement of my husband and friends, I am a proud owner of all 6 seasons. If you enjoy any of the following: shows from the late 60s/early 70s, seeing the evolution of medicine since then, slightly over-dramatized but well acted stories, this will be a good purchase for you. Best of all, at least to me, there is no violence in any of the shows. Also, without being saccharine, the episodes typically end happily.
I have watched the previous five seasons repeatedly, and I'm sure to follow suit with this one as well.",1458950400,10,677,4.424
7673678,3,B01CDT6374,Another medical series ... Tv's favorite subject ?  This one is above average despite that with the sixth season the stories weren't as well written as in the beginning . Still interesting though.,1466467200,,196,4.9393939393939394
7673679,5,B01CDT6374,Most exciting episodes.  Worth every penny if you love Chad Everett/Dr. Joe Gannon.,1465776000,,83,5.384615384615385

7673681,5,B01CDT6374,How could a young Chad Everett be bad.  Great episodes and a more mature Dr. Gannon.  Can't wait for season 7.,1463961600,,110,4.190476190476191

7673684,1,B01CDT6374,Warner really cheaped out on this season release.  Doesn't compare in quality to the previous  5 seasons.  Really disappointing.... Looks more like a VHS copy release...,1462752000,,169,5.423076923076923

8752723,2,B01CDT6374,"I love each season of the series, but for the money I paid for each season, you'd think the quality would be better. It's very grainy and does not look restored at all. Very disapointing.",1536710400,,187,4.371428571428571
8752724,5,B01CDT6374,Great Medical Drama with handsome Chad Everett,1488585600,,46,5.714285714285714
8752725,4,B01CDT6374,"Ever since I got the first season, I have been watching the other seasons.  I got Season 6 for Christmas from my mom (thanks) and Season 7 for my birthday from my brother (thanks).

Season six has some  good episodes.  The one I liked the most was the episode where Richard Hatch plays a mentally challenged (i.e. autistic) man who works for his sister at their family owned dry cleaners.  His sister is afraid to let him spread his wings, even though the autistic man is able to hold a steady job, make a few friends, make deliveries for the cleaners on his bicycle, and help out  the kids in the pediatric ward.  This was a time when the mentally handicapped were being more integrated into society.  Quite a few today work as landscapers, busboys, baggage handlers, cooks, etc.

The episode where the nurse (I had no idea Marcia Rodd was an actress in the 70s, since I only remembered her as Dr. Riverside's wife on Trapper John, M.D. in the 80s) gave up her baby for adoption was touching (and somewhat positive - adoption is oftentimes not considered for single mothers, and many families would like to adopt), and I surprisingly liked the episode where the laicized (I guess he had been laicized) Catholic priest came to work at Medical Center as an orderly.  Unfortunately, too many priests between 1965 and 1980 left their Holy Orders, and while the episode brought this to light, the actor playing the laicized priest explained that celibacy was not the issue, which was the main reason I liked the episode.

There was also an episode that addressed pedophilia, which is definitely a crime, and the character had been in jail and was on his way back to prison.  This episode pushed the envelope.  A similar episode about this subject was dramatized on an episode of Marcus Welby, M.D. (the episode was titled ""The Outrage"") circa 1974, and quite a few ABC affiliates refused to air the episode. To my knowledge, ""The Outrage"" was only shown once (I have never seen this episode), since it is not in the syndication packages and ABC was forbidden to re-run the episode.  Anyway, during the Medical Center episode, both Dr. Gannon and Dr. Lochner stood their ground that taking a drug to become impotent would not stop the man from being a pedophile.  Nowadays, episodes like this are common on ""Law and Order: SVU.""

As some other reviewers pointed out, the episode on breast cancer was also good, and it did receive an award.  Back in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, certain cancers related to women did not receive much research funding, and there was also a discussion about insurance and pre-existing conditions.  I have to admit I liked the episode ""Aftershock"", which took place when an old hospital collapses after a gas explosion.  I think part of the idea for the script (and maybe one of the outside shots) came from the Sylmar Earthquake that happened on February 9, 1971.  At least one building at the VA Hospital Complex in Sylmar collapsed, killing at least 60 people, most of them patients.

Per usual, I like seeing the old cars (Dr. Gannon now drives a Corvette) , and I can tell more of the outside shots in these later episodes (at the beginning the ambulance passes a parking lot, and that parking lot is now the location of the Ronald Reagan Hospital portion of the UCLA Medical Center) is stock footage from previous Medical Center episodes, but I do like seeing the old Cadillac ambulances.  I did notice the base station in the third season episode where one of these Cadillac ambulance radioed the hospital.  Season six was the first time I heard the word ""paramedic"" uttered by Dr. Lochner - I was an EMT for six years myself.  I came on in the late 1980s, so my first rig was a Type III van.

Here's a short trivia piece:  by the 1980s, most of the Cadillac ambulances left were only allowed for patient transfer use, or as a backup unit.  New ambulance regulations were passed, and Cadillac downsized the DeVille Chassis by several inches for the 1977 model year, so the two main manufacturers at that time sold very few Cadillac ambulance after the 1976 model year.  The last Cadillac ambulance was manufactured  in 1979.

Looking forward to watching Season Seven.",1486857600,,4192,4.663945578231292
8752726,5,B01CDT6374,"Who didn't love Medical Center and in particular, Chad Everett?! I love watching the series. It takes me back to a time when doctors had more control and time for patients' medical care. Today insurance companies have the control and doctors have to hustle to make ends meet. Watching this series makes me nostalgic for former days. And Chad Everett was a hunk!",1478131200,,361,4.746031746031746
