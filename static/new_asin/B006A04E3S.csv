4981165,5,B006A04E3S,"One of the best if not the best this year. Everyone will find something too enjoy in this one, if not you really hate music. Audio perfect, picture perfect. Variates from vest coast,soul, funk too hard rock. Great main artists with lots of guests and great combinations. If you are going too pick highlights here you have a problem because there are so many of them. Metallica may have put the silkgloves on but that`s a very minor detail. One hell of a gathering if you ask me. Buy it.",1290729600,,486,4.411111111111111
4981166,4,B006A04E3S,"I tried to wait till October 12, when The Rolling Stones' ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" will be released so I'll order ""Rock & Roll"" together with that and a few others. And I could not wait past three days. I had to run to Best Buy to find ""R&R"".

Other than the superb performances and video quality of the disks I find one other thing most pleasing. Disk 1 contains classic rock performances. If that's all you care for you'll find disk 1 very satisfying with no reason to skip chapters.  Metallica is on disk 2.

While the DVD version of ""R&R"" has three disks the B-Ray version has two. If you regularly skip bonus material on disks don't do so with these; you'll miss a lot. Each disk has bonus performances.

It is disappointing to buy a video disk only to discover that the 2-channel audio option delivers better audio than the multi-channel option. That is my experience with this blu-ray release. In this case it's the center speaker that is out of balance with the rest when you choose the M/C option- it's too loud.

Check out Collective Soul's ""Home"" blu-ray disk for a comparison. ""Home"" is the standard in blu-ray audio (in my experience).",1286236800,3,1146,4.543689320388349
4981167,5,B006A04E3S,"Too few hours, & too many great bands.
With that said, RUN, & buy this superlative collection
Yes, lots of premier acts; (Eagles, Dead, Airplane, Floyd, Fleetwood, etc.), weren't present. Whoa; the ones that were, kicked butt!
My highlights; U2/Mick, & Fergie; (Gimme Shelter)
Stevie Wonder/Jeff Beck; (Superstition)
Everything else was phenomenal
Picture quality/Blu-Ray/9.5; ditto for sound; nothing is perfect.
I'll save my 10 for ""Ladies & Gentlemen""/Blu-Ray, next week.
My HD/DVR/HBO version, was almost as good/picture quality
True/HD/DTS sound, is at least a level better, than 5.1
Plus, the Blu-Ray has an additional hour plus, of music.

4981168,5,B006A04E3S,"I still have The 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame Concert on my DVR from when it originally aired on HBO at the end of 2009, and I still often find myself viewing many of the standout performances pretty regularly to this day. I have vowed not to erase it until it is released on Blu Ray and DVD, and finally owning this will be a welcome treat!

If you're wondering why the Blu Ray version of the 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Concert is available at Amazon 30 days after the DVD release date, it's because the Blu Ray version of the package is available only at Best Buy for the first 30 days. Man, I hate that. But I've waited now for a year for this release, so waiting an extra 30 days is no sweat I guess. Anyway....

If you were at The 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Concerts or you saw it when it aired on HBO you already know how awesome these performances were that occurred over the course of two nights in late October 2009. If you haven't seen this and you like music, even just a little, you're in for a great experience. This collection is worth its weight in gold.

The great news is that the DVD and Blu Ray releases include a ton of bonus stuff that wasn't aired on HBO, so it'll be great fun again for me to give this entire release a fresh look.

According to Time Life, following is what's going to be on the release, and I've marked the standout performances with this mark: *****  Rest assured that almost every performance stands out; it's all a matter of musical preference. I like all kinds of music with a preference for hard rock, but some of these performances truly converted me into a fan of acts that I never liked or really paid little attention to prior to seeing this:

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN & THE E STREET BAND (Gotta admit that I was not the biggest Bruce fan prior to seeing him here; his performances with Sam Moore, and then of all people, Tom Morello absolutely knocked it out of the park.)
Hold On I'm Comin' with Sam Moore*****

Personal favorites; U2 - Gimme Shelter, The Boss + U2, Simon and Garfunkle, some of the older rock pioneers. A special favorite is the closing song of Jackie Wilson's (your love keeps lifting me) Higher and Higher starting with Springsteen and adding so many other singers that it became difficult to see them all. The DVD has the complete version, which is rousing. HBO used a condensed version during closing credits.

Simon & Garfunkel's The Boxer will blow you away.  Paul Simon, Graham Nash and David Crosby's version of Here Comes the Sun is simply beautiful.  The harmonies sound like school boys instead of the older men you see singing at the mics.  There are so many more great numbers to like on this dvd.

4981227,3,B006A04E3S,"CS&N, S&G, U2 and Jeff Beck were great.  The Gimme Shelter was clearly top shelf.  Most of the songs in these sets were excellent and I'll listen to them regularly.  The art of harmony is not lost.  It's a real pleasure to listen to Graham and David hit the notes and mix it up with other artists.  Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel gave a very inspiring performance.  The performance by Jeff Beck had the quality of a headliner, even though he was a backup, .

I swear that Bruce Springsteen was playing air guitar.  After watching many live performances of the real masters, I'd rather see an artist pick up a microphone or tambourine if the skills on an instrument are no longer there.  As a fan for years, it's sad to see how much Billy Joel has lost. I started skipping some songs in Aretha's set.

After listening to this several times, I'd still buy in a minute.  The remote would be in my lap as I picked my way through it.",1379894400,5,926,4.294797687861272

There are so many artists that I can't name them all but let me say there's something here for fans of just about every genre of rock.
From roots to metal to straight forward rock this covers the bases well.
Check out Bonnie Raitt & Jeff Beck & CSN & Metallica & Springsteen & Billy Joel & Paul Simon & John Fogerty and many more.
The best surprise for me was all the extras on the Blu-ray that weren't included on Netflix, including several more live performances.
I also have to say that to me it's obvious someone with live music mixing experience mixed the audio.
Let me 'splain...when someone who doesn't have that experience mixes a live music event, you can tell because whoever the camera is on at the moment is the LOUDEST in the mix. For this you hear a true live mix...even if the cam isn't on a certain person you hear whoever is taking lead at the time.
And my hubby who is an audio engineer/musician will probably smack me for saying that Tom Morello's guitar solo on Springsteen's ""Tom Joad"" brought him to tears.
If you're a rock fan...get this.
Small disclaimer: we watch this on a home theater system with 5.1 audio and upscaling Blu-ray player. Worth it!",1374364800,2,1272,4.3940677966101696

Live Aid is definitely an historic landmark that not only bears witness to the generosity of so many but also makes it evident that good music was not a stranger to a vast number of bands and musicians at the time, however big or small they were.

4981255,2,B006A04E3S,"I think the concerts come across exactly like they were planned - let's feature whoever we can get and throw in some representatives of genres here and there.  But the main question the organizers appear to have forgotten to ask is, ""can they still sing well?""

Some can - James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Art Garfunkel, Stevie Wonder, Bono, Springsteen and Jagger, but many can't, and just shouldn't: Paul Simon, Stephen Stills (not at all in fact), Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin (what a shame), Ozzy Osbourne, Billy Joel.  For me, it isn't enough to cough up big bucks for a concert just for the joy of ""seeing"" a former star - I want to hear good music that in their prime they could give.

Instrumentally, everyone in the concert was still excellent, and I really enjoyed that part of it.  I guess that makes sense - the vocal chords will stretch and thin out due to age, but if you can still hear and move your arms/hands/fingers, you don't normally forget how to play.

Thematically I was confused - this was the 25th Anniversary of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which means what...?  The inductees to the Hall include Simon and Garfunkle, Neil Diamond, Metallica, the Bee Gees, Madonna...musicians covering genres like R&B, pop, hard rock, soft rock, pop, jazz.  But the concert was not an attempt to cover each genre (or at least if it was an attempt, it failed).  Obviously more genres meant more stars, more rehearsal studios, more logistics.  But I think more singers with fewer songs each would have been the awesome event originally conceived.  In other words, set up the venue and goal and stick to it - if it doesn't pan out, dump it.  The concert notes say that Aretha Franklin was a royal pain, but yet they headline her with 4+ numbers (and she just doesn't have it any more). Aretha Franklin was big in her time, but that's really pushing the envelope for baby boomers out there - people in their mid-50's and later might have really enjoyed that part, but I sure didn't.

These discs contain some awesome performances (Simon and Garfunkle when Simon's singing harmony only; Stevie Wonder; Jackson Browne; Springsteen), so they may still be worth the price, you'll just find yourself skipping a lot of material.",1340582400,5,2232,4.6923076923076925

4981261,5,B006A04E3S,"I'm more of a rock & roll guy than blues, so disc 2 in itself was worth the price for me. Some of the collaborations here are just outstanding.
Personally I thought U2's set was the best, with 'Gimme Shelter' taking the cake. Mick Jagger's still got it (he brings the house down, no question). Was it just me or did Ferige actually take that song to another level (I know!)?
Tom Morello was superb (again!). I was also very happy to see 2 of my favorites - John Fogerty (Creedence) and Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top) - on stage.
Another personal favorite was Jeff Beck's instrumental cover of the Beatles' ""A Day in the Life"" - It was perfect!

There's really no downside to purchasing this. Most of the artists here are on the wrong side of 50 (or 60), so this might really be the best chance of seeing them rock on stage, let alone together.

Really all the the Springsteen set. Then there's Fergie and Mick Jagger. Sting and Jeff Beck also make a good impression.
I am not a metal fan, but the Metallica set cooked.
If you want to nitpick, you could complain that most of the artists hail from the baby boom generation, getting long in the tooth. Almost all who make it into the hall of fame are going to be in their 50's and 60's, and these artists are featured on this production.

DURING THE JOHN LEGEND SECTION, STEVIE DOES MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL'  HE GETS OVERWHELMED WITH EMOTION AND CAN'T SING FOR A SHORT MINUTE THEN COMES BACK STRONG.  STEVIE MAY HAVE REQUESTED TO REMOVE IT  OR THE PRODUCERS DIDN'T DECIDED NOT TO SHOW THE UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE.  YOU CAN WATCH THE DELETED PART ON YOU TUBE.",1512691200,,397,4.695652173913044
