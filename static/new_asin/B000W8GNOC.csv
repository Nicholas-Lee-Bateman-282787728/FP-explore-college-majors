8221602,4,B000W8GNOC,"The reason I purchased this movie is because I did stunts on it.  I'm the guy that doubles the stagecoach driver falling off of the coach.
The first stuntman broke his arm doing this stunt---I replaced him.
I'm also the guy that runs from the building and tries unsuccessfully (twice) to stop the runaway stagecoach that Veronica Cartwright is frantically trying to stop.  (I may have been tipping a few).
