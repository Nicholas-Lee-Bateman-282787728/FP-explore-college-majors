8034959,5,B0002Y4TWY,"When I bought this DVD set I knew what to expect from it, so receiving the package it was simply the best thing!
I tried the instant download for the content from another source some years ago, which did work but not as well as I expected, so the DVDs for my are just great, and I got into to using them immediately and took them on holiday over the Christmas period, so I could keep up with my leaning programme and for me are easier to use with play back onto a big screen TV with easier controls.
I have other material by  Jorma and the songs on these DVDs compliment this and have expand my repertoire!",1388966400,5,606,4.135593220338983
8034960,5,B0002Y4TWY,"Very well done, informative series. Easy to understand, easy to learn. I would recommend for any average guitar player, not for beginners.",1370217600,4,138,5.318181818181818
8034961,3,B0002Y4TWY,I was really hoping for a breakdown video of how the songs are played. Jorma does go into the how's and whys but not deep enough into the how to. I would like to have complete detailed analysis of the songs instead of abreviated versions.,1358380800,,238,4.311111111111111

8034963,4,B0002Y4TWY,But if all you want is to learn how he does it...he shows you and does a good job too!,1247270400,2,86,3.35
8034964,5,B0002Y4TWY,"The individual performances on these DVDs are worth the cost alone. Jorma's instruction, and explanation of technique, is easy to follow. It really feels like a one on one lesson. If you've ever admired Jorma's playing, you'll be happy to know it's not as difficult to play as it sounds. It will take alot of practice to master though. If you have solid intermediate fingerstyle chops, you'll be able to handle many of the tunes. My only criticism of this series is that the included tab does not precisely match the version Jorma plays on the DVD. The tab is not incorrect, it just has some variations. I would recommend using the tab for reference and studying it later for the variations. I hate to end on a negative note, so I will say that this one of the best guitar resources I have ever purchased.",1105142400,29,805,4.52054794520548
