4859759,5,B005QQGXR2,"We have been enjoying this DVD every couple of days since it came. I like that it doesn't have any filler stuff between the songs. It's fun to hear the sesame street versions of popular songs, and even our 2 year old son seems to like these songs better than the traditional sesame street songs. He asks to watch it ""Songs! Songs!"" I will say before we had this we were getting the same thing from a YouTube playlist we created on Apple TV, but this is portable and has songs we hadn't heard. Favorite tracks: What I Am- Will I am, My Triangle- James Blunt, I got a New Way to Walk- Destiny's Child.",1338681600,2,599,4.217391304347826
4859760,5,B005QQGXR2,"Our baby loves music, and one song he really reacts to is the Sesame Street version of Feist's song ""1234"".  We saw that the song was available on DVD, and after looking into what was included, we decided to take a chance on the other songs.  We weren't disappointed; for the price, the DVD has a decent amount of content.  I really admire some of these artists for appearing on Sesame Street, often singing tongue-in-cheek versions of their biggest hits.  Some of the clips are a little old; a couple that jumped out were Destiny's Child and N'Sync.  As a parent, I appreciated that the songs gave us a little nod and a wink, since we'll probably be listening to the songs over and over again.  Be warned, some of these songs may already grate on you from being overplayed the first time they came around.  James Blunt's ""You're Beautiful"", Jason Mraz's ""I'm yours"", Alicia Keys ""Fallin'"" and Norah Jones ""Don't Know Why"" are represented on this DVD.  Considering the puns and wordplay, I don't mind just yet.  I will admit, Ricky Gervais and Adam Sandler stand out in this collection as not being quite on par with some of the artists, but I don't mind them being on the DVD.",1337817600,10,1177,4.540284360189573
4859761,5,B005QQGXR2,"This terrific DVD is the follow-up to ""Elmo's Music Magic"" which was released last year. In fact, this 2012 release is a lower priced version of the SSSWTS DVD released in 2011 and comes with a bonus CD (more on that in a minute).

While ""Elmo's Music Magic"" -see my review of it elsewhere on Amazon - had a few celebrities performing, this DVD's 17 songs are all by well known pop (and in one case, classical) artists and it's a joy to watch, even if you don't have children. Will,i. Am starts things off with the song ""What I Am"" and anyone watching it - no matter their age - will find themselves getting into the groove. Some of the songs are originals and some are adaptations of big hits by the ""stars"". When Norah Jones sings to Elmo the song ""Y"", it's virtually the same as her hit ""Don't Know Why"" but it teaches children the alphabet. The Black Eyed Peas' Sheryl Crow James Blunt and R.E.M are here too. More Alphabet songs come from The Dixie Chicks (""B""), and Ricky Gervais (""N""), the latter being a lullaby (well, sort of). Personally I find Gervais a bit annoying and the same goes with Adam Sandler (who talks his way through a song about Elmo, but those are the only weak numbers (at least for me). Others on the DVD are `N Synch, Alicia Keys, Goo Goo Dolls, LL Cool J, Destiny's Child, Feist, Hootie and the Blowfish, Jason Mraz and the amazing closer: Andrea Bocelli actually dueting with the red fuzzy Elmo for ""Time to Say Goodbye (Goodnight"").

The DVD has a Karaoke option for 8 of the songs (as a bonus) though you can also chose the ""English subtitles"" option and sing along with all the songs. Other bonus features are aimed at parents with ""Musical Activity Tips"" and a downloadable activity book.

One thing that surprised me is that - as you play the DVD - the ""stars"" are not identified and, in only a few cases, are introduced on the videos. There is a ""chapter"" list of the songs but - even then - some artists aren't listed.

The package cover prominently advertises the included ""Free 5-song CD"". I thought this was great idea, expecting to have the audio of the songs to sing along with and play away from the DVD player. But the 13-minute CD is not the soundtrack from the DVD, but five common children's songs  ( ""Eensy Weansy Spider"", ""If You Are Happy and You Know It"", ""The Wheels on the Bus""). But, hey, it's FREE.

If you are an adult and loved the recent ""Muppet Movie"", you'll get a kick out of this. And, if you are a parent, I can't think of a DVD that will entertain both you and your kids (for 48 minutes) more than this one. Now, I can't wait for more of these Sesame Street music videos to be released.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4859766,5,B005QQGXR2,This awesome DVD has been a lifesaver. My son loves Elmo and really loves Elmo singing! This DVD works the best of both of those and keeps these in a non-data using place. It is hard to take trips with a 2 year old and even harder on my pocketbook paying for data to stream videos on the road. This allows my son to enjoy a great set of songs for 45 minutes and get a great feel of Elmo too!,1475107200,,391,3.8395061728395063

4859784,5,B005QQGXR2,This DVD is my child's absolute favorite by far! Great music and character interaction. He recognizes the faces of his favorite stars with a huge grin and cooing and dances to the songs. And he's still an infant! 5 stars. I would order it 100 times over.,1444262400,,254,4.425531914893617
4859785,3,B005QQGXR2,"I enjoyed this one, as I am familiar with the artists and the songs, but my toddler seemed unimpressed. She typically loves anything Sesame Street, and shows her enthusiasm by clapping, screaming, and dancing to the tunes, which she did not do while this movie was on.",1442275200,,268,4.723404255319149

4859794,5,B005QQGXR2,"We purchased this as a gift for my 18 month old for his easter basket this year and he LOVES it! He will literally sit and watch the entire thing start to finish while dancing and singing along (this is a big deal for him). The DVD is totally over-priced in my opinion. It's like 45 minutes long and really dated, but if he loves it, I love it.",1430265600,,344,4.0
4859795,1,B005QQGXR2,Stopped working after the first watch....very disappointing and a waste of money.,1429228800,,81,5.833333333333333

4859806,5,B005QQGXR2,"Our (at the time) 15 month old was instantly obsessed from the minute Will. I. am (or however he spells it) started singing. I appreciated the parent-friendly guests (ricky gervais, Adam sandler, etc), and the fact that there wasn't a whole bunch of talkee talkee between the songs, which causes our son to lose interest rather quickly. We utilized this as a travel aid while flying to NC and it saved us from meltdowns over and over again.",1419897600,,440,4.653846153846154
4859807,5,B005QQGXR2,This is one of our granddaughter's favorite videos.  She can watch it over and over.  It's very cute and clever.  As much fun for grow ups as the little ones!,1418601600,,158,4.2

4859810,2,B005QQGXR2,"Cute idea but the sound quality on this is atrocious.  Sounds like it was recorded off the radio onto a cassette tape.  I would not recommend this product until they correct the issues with the sound.  Otherwise, it would especially be entertaining for the parents who grew up with many of the guest singers.",1415318400,,308,4.666666666666667
4859811,5,B005QQGXR2,"I have bought about a dozen Sesame Street DVDs, mostly musically oriented because they are the only ones my 2yr old son will have the patience to sit thru. We have actually purchased this particular one twice now because we wore out the first DVD.

I was a little worried about the use of ""stars"" being a little dated and hard for me to sing along with them and my son, since that is always one of the best aspects, but almost all of the songs are easily learned, extremely well written, and catchy. Honestly, I think my son's true love of this DVD in particular is that I do sing along with it and show my own enthusiasm... A couple of the songs he will literally come a pull me to the TV when they are about to come on, namely Counting to Four, My Triangle, and Celebrity Lullaby among others.

If you're a Sesame Street fan and want to have some fun interaction with your child, that is still mildly educational, I would highly recommend this DVD (along with Kid's Favorite Songs 1 & 2).",1414454400,,990,4.288770053475936

4859814,5,B005QQGXR2,"My 2 year old daughter loves this DVD. And the songs are actually very good so it's the only Elmo video I don't mind her playing over and over again.

If it matters to anyone, there are three clips Elmo doesn't appear in. The James Blunt segment (the only one my daughter asks me to skip), the REM segment, or the Dixie Chicks segment. A few others he barely appears in. In the Sheryl Crow segment my daughter doesn't recognize him because he is wearing beach attire but she still seems to like that song.",1409702400,,505,4.315789473684211
4859815,5,B005QQGXR2,My son who just turned 1 absolutely LOVES this.  We have it on the kindle and it has entertrained him in the car on long rides as well as just at home.  If he's fussy this is sure to get him smiling.  His favorites are the NNNN song with Ricky Gervais and Dancin' with Alicia Keys.  I have videos of him going crazy.

4859825,5,B005QQGXR2,"Most children's programming makes me suicidal once I've had to watch it more than 3 times.  Not this one.  My 16 month old loves it and it allows us to travel in the car without major screaming meltdowns.  Bonus that the songs are sung by artists that I know and enjoy, to the tune of songs that I grew up with myself.  I mean, you've got N'Sync, Destiny's Child, Goo Goo Dolls... this is like a throwback to high school.  I get all nostalgic and find myself humming these tunes along with the movie while I'm running errands.  Anything that helps mommy go zen in the car instead of insane is a real win.  Yay!

When the Sesame Street characters are on the screen, she likes it but but I think for a young child focusing on the person makes them lose interest quickly.  Thankfully I rented this from the library before buying it.  The best song I think is the one with Will.i.am, it's very energetic and the Sesame Street characters have a great part in that video.

To Kevin Clash's credit, he did well creating this character.  I guess I'm too old to get it.  I'm glad it keeps my toddler entertained.  The favorite in my house seems to be Furry, Happy Monsters, courtesy of R.E.M., followed by Ricky Gervais and his song about the letter ""N"".  Third is Destiny's Child, ""I Got A New Way To Walk"".

4859839,2,B005QQGXR2,"Considering you can stream each of these off YouTube (for free) I was expecting at least the resolution to approach HD. But the video is no better than YouTube.
If this was the only outlet for these great songs, it would easily be 5 stars, but for ten bucks (I paid 15, I think) I would expect more. Also, it would be nice if the quality would enable fast forwarding by track instead of by position. You can just save the youtubes to your profile and then be so much more modular and capable.

I did notice that there was a lack of reviewing the complete product. The 5 stars is for the Singing with the stars. I didn't wanna drag down the review score based off of one small part you don't necassarily care about so i won't but...

Negative: The CD it comes with is garbage. I, like a few of you, i'm sure, just assumed the CD was of the DVD content. it's not. it's about 5 songs that are about a minute & a half long each song. it is some of the sesame street gang singing  some version of songs like farmer in the dell, etc. Each song was over before you knew it got started.",1358985600,,716,4.0

My 22 month old really enjoyed a select few Youtube videos we would pull for her in which ELMO sang with cover songs with famous artists (Feist, Jason Mraz, Ricky Gervais, Katy Perry, Andrea Bocelli, NOra Jones). But Youtube excerpts are not travel-friendly, so I was thrilled with this DVD that it had these artists and several more (Destiny's child, Backstreet Boys, Alicia Keys, GooGoo Dolls). My daughter loves it,and I am glad we are not tied to the internet.

I bought this for my 20 month old baby daughter she loves it she asks for it everyday. The songs are really quite pleasant to listen to as an adult I find a lot of the children's songs to be a little incessant. This is a musical collection I can have in the background and just enjoy listening to the music. This is not like Elmo's world with little segments stories. This video has a song related to some kind of a letter or a lesson. It's a collection of different clips through the years with different celebrities to sing. I absolutely love it my daughter absolutely loves it and even my husband who hates everything related to children's product marketing and forced joy loves this video.

4859878,5,B005QQGXR2,"I bought this DVD after having watched some of the Sesame Street music videos on YouTube together with my 10 month old baby.  Unlike the Baby Einstein videos which he didn't like at all, I noticed that he responded very well to the music videos.  I searched Amazon for a Sesame Street DVD that had his favorites and found this DVD.  It was a no-brainer purchase, and a great one that I would recommend to other parents.  This is one DVD that I can actually watch and sing along to very happily whereas other baby DVDs just bore me to death.  The DVD is a collection of videos with songs sung by various international stars and different Sesame Street characters.  My baby is very active and he normally can't sit still for a second, but once this is on he is totally engaged by these songs.  He loves them.  Despite my initial plan not to let my baby anywhere near a TV until he gets older, I've relaxed about letting him watch this.  It's highly entertaining for him, and once he gets older, it will have some educational value too.

The DVD Song list:
What I am - Will.i. Am (of Black Eyed Peas fame)
Pride- Goo goo dolls
