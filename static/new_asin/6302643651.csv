488817,3,6302643651,"This is a beautiful telling of the Moses storey.  The antithesis of the Cecile B DeMille's over-the-top (but enjoyable) version.

This is a very understated, and therefore entirely realistic version of how it could have happened.

The edited version is acceptable, but I recall that the full version really conveyed a sense of the epic journey, which this compressed version, simply does not.

Hopefully the studios will give it a good digital clean up and release the full version in the near future.

Furthermore, the musical score is one of Ennio Morricone's best....not to be missed!",1244678400,4,587,5.072916666666667
488818,4,6302643651,"This is an extraordinary production in every respect.  However, I'm only giving it a 4 star rating because it's an abridged version of the full 300 minute original.  If you want to savor every heartfelt minute of the original 300, consider buying Moses the Lawgiver for Regions 1 (US and Canada) and 4 (Central and South America).  This two DVD set plays on American DVD players and has English audio.  At the present time, the Region 1 and 4 DVD is available through Amazon.com.  You don't have to make do with the abridged version, or pay out for a DVD player to play Region 2 (Europe) as one reviewer did.  Stay closer to home and buy this one marketed for Latin America (with the original English audio)!",1242000000,7,708,4.535433070866142
488819,4,6302643651,"What can I say about the Movie ""Moses"" Staring Burt Lancaster other than it does an excelent job of actually following the Book of Exodus in the Bible. THe directors try to keeep the charachter Moses to how he was potrayed in the Bible. Moses stutters so his brother speaks for him to Pharoah. The plagues and the parting of the Red Sea has such realism that you can picture the biblical descprition while viewing it. Mannafalls from the trees like bread from heaven.

I reccommend this version of the story of the Exodus over any other due to its absolute parralelism with the Biblical Story.",1233532800,3,593,4.59433962264151
488820,3,6302643651,"This is a shortened version of a 1970's TV mini series dealing with the story of Moses and the exodus of the Hebrews during the reign of an Egyptian pharaoh.

This movie is not close to the epic of the 1950's classic The Ten Commandments. It can't be really being made for TV. The acting is ok, not stellar, but it won't put you to sleep watching it. The story goes over more than that covered in The Ten Commandments though, and that is something that it has going for it.

Overall it's a good compliment to the de Mille classic and one I recommend watching for what happens after the Hebrews receive the Ten Commandments.",1232582400,2,623,4.362068965517241

I always wanted that and wondered how I could get that.  They have it in Europe but not here in America. and the reason is, they have the miniseries in PAL format and the edited in america's format. so I went ahead and order the edited one. and before it came, I found out that if you have the right dvd player u can play Europe movies.  Then I went ahead and ordered a dvd player that plays both PAL and NTSC formats.  Then ordered the miniseries from Amazon in Europe.  AND IT'S MUCH BETTER!!!!",1125100800,25,625,4.218487394957983
488823,5,6302643651,"Originally aired as a CBS miniseries, this Italian-British-American production features a subdued Burt Lancaster as a man struggling with the heavenly responsibility of liberator of the children of Israel.
Backed by an international cast and a magnificent Ennio Morricone score, this is a rarity as a Biblical epic, one devoid of the big-budgeted special effects and over-the-top acting so characteristic of the genre. It tells one of the most important and essential stories of all time in a poignant and challenging way.
A great film for fans of the actor and great storytelling, ""Moses"" transcends over all others.",1039824000,28,617,5.3061224489795915

488860,4,6302643651,"Moses the Lawgiver (1974)

Burt Lancasters Moses is one who questions God and himself. In this more naturalist version, the voice of God is off screen speaking through the voice of Lancaster, thus making the God encounter an inner, spiritual one.

The burning bush sequence is longer than in the other films with Moses putting up more of an argument, and at the end when the voice stops, looking around as if he is disoriented. The shots of the two miracles to be used as signs of his authority are from his point of view, suggesting that these were inner experiences.

The special effects for the familiar plagues and Red Sea crossing are so-so, but by now the viewer should be are that this is a much more thoughtful, even challenging, approach to the story than it is a spectacle. Before going up Mt. Sinai, Moses explains the need for laws, virtually reciting a list of the Ten Commandments.

We never see the inscribing of the tablets. Instead, the film cuts to a long sequence in the camp where the rebels overcome Aarons reluctance to fashion a god who will protect them now that Moses is gone. The ecstatic celebration around the golden calf is not only the orgy depicted in other versions, but devolves into the seizure of a young woman. What follows when Moses says the people must suffer for their rebellion is too graphic for young children.

We see that Moses can be a harsh leader when a man is caught working on the Sabbath. Moses insists that he must be stoned to death.  Following the stoning Moses utters an argumentative prayer and God answers, telling him that he will not let him go.

This is an excerpt from my article ""Moses: Movie Star"" published by the Presbyterian News Service at https://www.pcusa.org/news/2014/12/12/moses-movie-star/",1419120000,,1762,4.757377049180328
488861,3,6302643651,"Burt Lancaster's performance as Moses is one of the meager reasons to own/view this title.  His portrayal of Moses is far superior than the farce depicted by ""The Ten Commandments"".  The rest of the acting was fair. The movie as a whole left out key moments, IMHO. Like, it never shows when Moses strikes the rock as opposed to speaking at it. However, it does make the referrence to Moses unbelief that keeps him from the promised land. Altogether, if you were teaching your children, it's better than the afore-mentioned alternative.",1418860800,,535,4.868131868131868

An introspective Moses is fine, but the remainder of the cast is underused and underserved.  What hurts most is the anachronistic expresssion of ideas expressed in equally anachronistic language.
