8467302,2,B005DP8CLQ,"I thought it was rather boring. I was sort of expecting him to go to Aberdeen and Inverness, Glasgow and the Highlands, but he wasted a lot of time in too many one horse towns where there was nothing really going on. Didn't watch the whole thing, but was rather boring and shocked when I saw  1978!!",1520208000,,299,4.245614035087719

8467304,4,B005DP8CLQ,"This is an amusing series featuring odd places in Scotland.  It is not professionally done, which makes it all the more charming.  If you're interested in how tiny spots in Scotland, clear to the Shetlands, have survived wars and weather, this is for you.  Most enjoyable.  The interviews with locals are of special interest.",1428883200,,325,4.962962962962963
8467305,5,B005DP8CLQ,"Love Tom Weir, especially the episode on Bonnie Prince Charlie's flight: he makes history feel very close, I want my children to feel this too. It's true the episodes are old (seventies), but does it really matter if the quality isn't blue ray, 3-D, IMAX? Come on, the content is amazing. I love it.",1420243200,,299,4.555555555555555

8467307,5,B005DP8CLQ,This book has lots of information that will prove useful when I plan my visit to Scotland.  Great price too.,1353974400,,108,4.4
8467308,2,B005DP8CLQ,Bad picture quality . Colors not vivid . This is a DVD created from 1970's and found to be so boring I just shut off . Not one of the better ones on Amazon .,1344729600,3,157,3.5142857142857142
