3770450,4,B001QU9RSE,Great show that probably should have run six seasons. Season seven was starting to lag and season eight was just plain weak. If it wasn't for Steven Weber season eight would have been a total flop.,1243468800,2,197,4.5
3770451,4,B001QU9RSE,"Wings is my all-time favorite sitcom. Even though I agree the last season was a bit weak, I still enjoyed it.

I think when the writers took the main plots out of the airport, it lost a lot. In my opinion, the weakest episodes took place in Helen and Joe's home. No matter how hard you try, wings on a vacuum cleaner doesn't work.

I am glad I purchased the entire collection (including season 8). I have already watched them all several times and I am sure I will, many times in the future.

For the entire series, I give Wings a strong 5 stars.",1242777600,15,546,4.180952380952381
3770452,5,B001QU9RSE,"The offspring of Cheers always seemed to produce bigger laughs than its parent as the seasons wore on. I was always enthralled with the main characters and would ever be curious about what they may be doing as the years wore on. Good writing, acting and solid comedy sustains throughtout the run of the show. Wher the heck is Jow, Helen and Brian these days? This inquiring mind wants to know as if they were real. A trinute to everyone on the show.",1242345600,,449,4.421686746987952
3770453,3,B001QU9RSE,"Seeing the final season of WINGS again after all these years reminds me of what I always felt was a strange mystery about the show............ that mystery being ... ""What the heck happened behind the scenes in the final season ?""

My wife and I have a collection of classic TV shows on DVD that we love and would rather watch 100 times over compared to much of the crap on these days. These include our favorites...... WINGS, CHEERS, SEINFELD, HOGANS HEROES, BECKER, STAR TREK TOS, etc......

But this final season of WINGS always seemed very strange.

You know how sometimes a show goes off the air and years later a reunion episode is done -or- they try to bring back the series and it feels wrong -- as though the actors could not connect with the vibe of their old characters ?
(think some of the Brady reunion shows where in their attempt to recapture the feel of their old characters they end up becoming their own spoofs).

WING'S final season seems that way.

Of course the stories were just silly and over the top for most of the last season (episodes like the Vacuum Cleaner episode are just painful to watch).  This is the fault of the writers.

But in addition to this some of the key actors really overplayed their parts and seemed out of character compared to earlier episodes.  This is especially true of Tim Daly and the way Joe behaved in most of the final season's episodes.  Helen was also over animated most of this last season.

Brian, Casey and Roy seemed to stay in character.

WINGS is still among our top 5 shows of all time and of course in no form of art or work can the same standard be maintained forever.
All things in life have their birth, peak period, decline and eventual departure.  TV shows are no different in that regard.

We will continue to watch WINGS over and over many times in our lives in the future, although I think Season 7 will not come out of the DVD case very often.

It would be interesting to know something about what was going behind the scenes during this time, as the changes in this last season were very unusual and noticeable.",1240099200,23,2087,4.443569553805775
3770454,3,B001QU9RSE,"The actors were let down by the writers the last season of the show.  The actors made the best of horrible story lines and scripts and if it were not for their creating magical characters in the previous years then this season would be downright painful to watch.  But being in love with these characters for 7 years it's hard to give up on them during their swan song season.

My motto is even bad Wings is better than most of the cr*p on TV these days.  This season really tests that motto but in the end it's still the characters I love and the actors did what they could with what they had.

I miss the show terribly and am glad that I have the entire collection to enjoy forever.",1239926400,2,684,4.190839694656488
3770455,5,B001QU9RSE,"I will have to agree that this probably isn't Wings' best season, but I love it just the same!  When ""Lowell"" left the show, I thought the show would end with that season as well.  But Crystal Bernard and Steven Weber, along with the additional of Amy Yasbeck as Helen's sister, the show was a riot!  These 3 were definitely what kept the show going!  I love Tim Daly, however, he's not as strong a comedic actor as these 3.  Can't wait to get this video!",1237334400,4,455,4.244186046511628
3770456,2,B001QU9RSE,"I'll be first in line to get this one, but like the others, I think this was the worst season.  Still such a good show - one of my all-time favorites!  I just wish there were some extra features on the other seasons - I would have loved commentaries and outtakes.  John Ritter was in some of the later episodes, and I would bet those outtakes were hilarious!",1235347200,3,358,4.235294117647059
3770457,3,B001QU9RSE,"I will buy this just to complete the set of my all time favorite series, but like so many other series, it should have ended just one season sooner than it did. This is what I consider the worst of Wings, but some of it is still funny enough to enjoy if you were a fan.",1234828800,9,269,3.8214285714285716
3770458,5,B001QU9RSE,it's about time. i was worried if this was going to be released. but finally the gods of sony have answer all my prays. this is the best sic-com ever made. hope you all enjoy the finale.,1234483200,6,186,4.054054054054054

3770480,5,B001QU9RSE,I loved the last episode. It was consistent to the first episode and really tied all of the seasons together. A beautiful way to end a memorable sitcom.,1417996800,,152,4.464285714285714

3770483,5,B001QU9RSE,"What a great group. Always funny and into each other's lives with laughing and crying on how they will always be friends, etc. etc.
I enjoyed all the shows and recommend this one as a keeper. Kudos to the seller for fast delivery.",1393977600,,230,4.372093023255814
3770484,5,B001QU9RSE,"this is a 5 star dvd,espeacially if you own the first 5. It gives me the complete set and Ihave watched it over and over and laughed everytime. I have also loaned it to others who were surprised how much they enjoyed it",1391212800,,219,4.116279069767442
3770485,5,B001QU9RSE,Have the entire series and really enjoy the antics in this show.  Can be viewed by the family and can hold the interest of the grand kids.,1388361600,,138,4.111111111111111

3770487,4,B001QU9RSE,"Nice to see a twist on the happily ever after and Joe does try hard to make Helen happy.  Sorry the series ended, so its nice to have this completing the collection.  Too bad there aren't more series like these (Frasier, Cheers) as they had storylines not just beefcake men and gorgeous women to pretty up the screen.",1386633600,,317,4.448275862068965
3770488,3,B001QU9RSE,It pains me to give the final season of Wings 3 stars but I must be honest with myself.  The hilarious and touching series Wings has such a bland final season.  If you dislike battle-of-the-sexes comedies like Everybody loves Raymond and King of Queens you probably won't like this season.  The stories are uninteresting and the dialogue is unfunny.  The only great episode is the series finale.  It is actually a callback to the very first episode as the brothers continue their late father's wild goose chase and find out their inheritance has been in the airport the whole time.  They squabble over the inheritance but the end is very touching.,1383436800,,647,4.783783783783784
3770509,1,B001QU9RSE,"I've loved Wings since I was in high school and used to catch it while it was in its first run.  It's on Netflix now, so my son and I started watching it together.

Wings went through some transitions over time:

* Season 1 was flat-out funny.
* Season 2, my son pointed out to me (and then he quickly lost interest in the series) was a lot of relationship type drama.
* Later, they returned to Season 1 style writing.
* And then there is Season 8.  Argh.

Season 8 had some really REALLY poor writing.  Watching the lines they gave Brian, always one of my favorite characters, was painful.  Helen became more ""animated"" and very unfunny in my opinion.  Joe vacillated between looking uninterested in his lines and yelling all the time.  Casey and Roy were really the only two that shined during this final season, in my opinion, both from a writing perspective and an acting perspective.

One unusual thing about this season was you could tell they used a lot of ""canned laughter"".  Helen would say something completely unfunny and the canned laughter would come in, quite loudly.  I wonder if they stopped filming in front of a live studio audience for this last season?  The canned laughter reminded me of watching an episode of Scooby Doo or The Brady Bunch.

At any rate, between the poor acting and the poor writing, I wonder if some of the writers left or just no one gave a crap because they knew it was the final hurrah.  Sad, really.  Wings was a real treasure through seven seasons, and I would've thought it would mean more to everyone involved for the last go.

Exception to Season 8:  Dreamgirl.  This epidsode was really, really good.",1373068800,,1649,4.5288135593220336
3770510,4,B001QU9RSE,We decided to watch Wings for lunchtime entertainment fun and discovered we did not have the final season.  Final season completed our collection.,1364256000,,146,5.3478260869565215
3770511,5,B001QU9RSE,"I love Wings, have recently seen it on TV and am happy to have these videos to watch all the episodes I missed",1362355200,,110,3.8260869565217392
3770512,5,B001QU9RSE,"We have enjoyed every season of wings. This has been an enjoyable time for us. Winter time is hard enough having to stay inside the house every evening, but this series has made it more tolerable.",1360281600,,196,4.472222222222222
3770513,5,B001QU9RSE,Final season was great and there were so many ways they could have ended it. I thought the ending they used was very satisfiying and left it open for more. I wish they would bring it back!!!!!,1351555200,,192,4.216216216216216
3770514,4,B001QU9RSE,"Ok, wings was ending. But the show was still going strong imo. Most of the episodes are very good and a few that are average. which is just about what you would expect. I can't say that I disliked a episode of this show ever. And I watch it in hd on reelz satellite or cable network. Wings was one of the better sitcoms of it's era and it still could be a hit today.  This dvd set is bare bones but if you collect the show you want it.",1343865600,,435,3.8333333333333335
3770515,3,B001QU9RSE,"I just watched the whole series for the first time since it went off the air over 10 years ago. I remember the last season being a little weak, and my memory was definitely accurate. This season took a dive in a similar way that ""The Office"" has the last 2 years. The storylines are ok, but the way the characters act are just downright stupid at times. When it was good, it was a show with good characters and a lot of wise-cracks thrown around. That's what made it funny. Lowell used to be the ridiculous one, but it's as if once he left, they turned every character into the ridiculous one. The most painful to watch was Joe....they turned him into a complete idiot. I feel bad for Tim Daly having to go through that.

That said, it's still one of my all-time favorite sitcoms, which is the only reason I'm so critical of the final season. Sucks to see a great show become so mediocre at the end, but I've noticed it happens to most good shows...they go on for a season or two longer than they should.",1305936000,,1004,4.2565445026178015
3770516,5,B001QU9RSE,I purchased this as a gift for my Fiance & arrived within the 2 day shipping period. It was still in the original packaging & shrinkwrap. No complaints about the content or quality of the DVD. Good price for this series - especially because it's so difficult to find in stores now.,1291766400,,281,4.423076923076923
3770517,5,B001QU9RSE,"Great show in its time, why did it have to end the way it did though? I know they could have done it better.",1279152000,,108,3.5416666666666665
3770518,5,B001QU9RSE,"I started watching Wings in 1993 and instantly fell in love with the show and all of the actors. My daughter Janet Lea York was killed on September 19, 2009. I was crushed beyond belief. Wings has been my therapy and my friend for a very long time.
Janet was only 13 and the day we laid her to rest, I received the DVD of the Final Season in the mail. what perfect timing, no one could console me but when I watch Wings, I felt better and that means alot to me.",1269388800,3,461,3.967741935483871
3770519,5,B001QU9RSE,"""Wings"" was one of the funniest, well written shows ever!  It was well cast.  I have all seasons, and watch them regularly.",1267660800,,123,4.545454545454546

3770521,5,B001QU9RSE,"This was a real laugh riot! Some of the episodes are so funny,you'll wet your undies watching them. It is a real shame,this kind of comedy does not have a place on today's television. Today they strain at making you laugh,here,it flows freely. This and the entire set I would tell anyone interested in REAL comedy,make a purchase!",1257552000,,330,4.706896551724138
3770522,4,B001QU9RSE,"I hadn't seen the final season of Wings when it aired originally, and I was worried when buying it that it would be a letdown (considering I found season seven a disappointment). But I was pleased to see that, in my opinion, the jokes and writing had improved over season seven.  I still find seasons 1 through 6 to be the better ones, but this last season did provide some great laughs with some episodes that I'll be watching again and again.",1253059200,,444,4.414634146341464
3770523,4,B001QU9RSE,"Is this the best season?  Probably not.  The characters begin the journey into parody as often happens on sitcoms.  But I can't deny this season was just as fun as the others.  I love Joe and Hellen as a married couple, as well as the sexual tension of the on again off again Brian and Casey.  And of course, Antonio and Roy always made me laugh.  This show was not ever the most popular as others, cheers/frasier, but it was certainly one of my favorites.  It also wasn't the most complicated, but that doesn't make me want to watch it any less.  In short, if you love wings, the last season will entertain you.  If you don't, then why are you even reading reviews of the last season?  To those who like wings, get it, you'll be very happy.",1251331200,,741,4.266187050359712
3770524,5,B001QU9RSE,"Wings was like a fine wine and got better with age.  The ""final season"" was bitter sweet; great season, but sad that it was the last.",1246838400,,133,4.115384615384615
3770525,4,B001QU9RSE,"I'm not sure why this season gets such a bad rap, I found it very enjoyable.  It's somewhat different than the other seasons, yes, but after seeing it I don't think it's nearly as bad as people make it out to be.  Definitely worth buying, there are a lot of moments here that made me laugh out loud.  I thought Casey (Amy Yasbeck's character) was particularly funny this season, and a handful of these episodes rank amongst my favorites of the entire series.  Buy it, see what you think.  If you're a Wings fan I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it.",1246147200,4,543,4.39
3770526,5,B001QU9RSE,"Wings was a great sitcom. I would recommend this whole series including the last season. The only part I did not like was when Joe and Helen were taken by the neighbors and the vacuum salesman. Even so, they do not make sitcoms like this anymore. REFRESHING AND FUNNY!!

3770528,5,B001QU9RSE,"Underated.  Under appreciated (except for it's diehard fans such as I). Badly treated and wholly ignored in promotion by it's own network, nonetheless Wings completed eight seasons that are an excellent example of finely tuned ensemble work by a tightly knitted group of actors in a simple setting.  When you realize that along with Tim Daly, Steven Weber, Crystal Bernard, David Schramm, and Rebecca Schull and their pitch perfect characterizations - the series also introduced us to Thomas Hayden Church and Tony Shalhoub, not to mention featuring Amy Yasbeck (widow of John Ritter).  I never understood why this series didn't find main stream fame like Cheers.  To each his own I guess.  This final season caps the madcap adventures of our cast with style and wit and while I can enjoy the antics of the majors in their post-series roles on Screen and TV I will forever have to dip my toes back into this series to get my fix of Fay Evelyn Schlob-Dumbly-DeVay-Cochran and her antagonist Roy Biggins (who took a skewed Oliver Hardy to new heights).

It's the only season I do not own yet and think it's horrible that people think and justify in there minds that the supply/demand of an item should make it OK to rob people blind with a price of an item that it is no where worth that value. It just makes me even more disappointed in what this world is coming to. I gave 5 stars because I love the show.
