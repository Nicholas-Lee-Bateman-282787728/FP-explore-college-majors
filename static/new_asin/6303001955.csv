7833659,5,6303001955,"This is such a funny movie, and I wish I could get it on DVD. Our family has had so many great laughs watching it. We all quote it to this day. It definitely has some potty humor in it, but not as much as Ren and Stimpy or Sponge Bob. So so so funny!",1292371200,4,250,3.5636363636363635
7833660,5,6303001955,"This is one of the funniest cartoons I have ever seen. Saw it on TV 20 years ago and was thrilled to see it was available on a VCR tape.
The dog in this movie is so funny but it is also true to life, too.
Would recommend this for everyone regardless of your age.",1234742400,,262,3.7818181818181817
7833661,5,6303001955,"Like it says on the cover of the movie, ""Family Dog is a delightfully offbeat, dog's-eye-view of modern family life!"" In Enimy Dog, Family Dog gets into trouble with the neighbors big dog K-10. In Show Dog, Familyu  Dog gets enrolled in a dog show and all he wants to do is get a drink of  water. Family Dog is so funny, it would be a mistake not to buy it!",954201600,8,357,4.014084507042254
