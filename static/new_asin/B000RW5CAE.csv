This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre:  Characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket!

This is not an all-out spoof like Scary Movie, but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies... when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun, silly, sexy, and goofy good time!",1193097600,11,850,5.094202898550725
2875735,3,B000RW5CAE,"So, we have reviews from two people thus far that have not watched the movie at all.  One guy stopped 20 minutes into the film and the other guy is confused or something. lol

STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE is an independent horror flick that is done in tribute to 80's horror movies.  All the classic characters are here, the jock, the rebel, the hot chick and the nerds.  Anybody who grew up watching 80's horror movies can easily see where the writers and director of the movie got their ideas.  Like in those old 80's films, the characters are one dimensional and the acting at times is silly, but isn't that the point they were trying to make?  I sure think so.

The story is simple, a group of teenagers spend the night in a house where a man murdered his family and these kids get the brilliant idea to try to raise his spirit.  As the deaths start to occur, several female characters get naked and the other characters make stupid decisions.  How friggin' 80's horror is that?!  The story sticks to the normal formulas, but there are couple of nice little ideas here and there.  I really enjoyed the possessed/zombie type thing that starts to happen at the end.

As for the film itself, being an indepedent movie that had little to no budget at all, the film does suffer at times.  The sound at certain points in the movie is pretty bad and some of the lighting is terrible.  Sure, all those cheesy 80's horror flicks had very little budgets, but this movie makes those look like they had a Spider-Man 3 sized budget.

However, you shouldn't let these production problems keep you from enjoying the good the movie has to offer.  Sure, it is not perfect, but the movie has some decent ideas, a bunch of good laughs and actress Lindsay Gareth's amazing breasts.",1191196800,16,1762,4.4937106918239
2875736,4,B000RW5CAE,"Honestly, the other reviewer must not have seen this. This movie is a documentary about teen slasher horror movies. It features numerous critics, film makers, and actors discussing how the teen slasher film has affected horror as a genre, and generations of film goers.
This is interesting if you love horror, and if you do, check it out.",1190937600,,338,4.844827586206897
2875737,4,B000RW5CAE,"I was actually surprised at the acting quality in this film, and it seems that while not much money was spent on the video production itself, whatever budget they had was spent on top-notch actors. The fact that this film pulls off its parody aspects and Also succeeds as a horror flick is pretty impressive.

Decent amount of extra features, and the music's pretty good. Hopefully this film does well enough for a sequel.",1190937600,2,422,4.702702702702703
2875738,1,B000RW5CAE,"I saw this one at my local video store and was attracted to the title.  I figured it would be lousy, but good for a few laughs in the so-bad-its good realm and some gratuitous nudity.  I also figured it would be cheaply produced, but, hey, it's at the video store and out on DVD so I never would have expected it wouldn't be a real movie.  It is not.  Some people like to say movies look like home movies as a way to describe how cheap a film looks.  It is usually an exaggeration.  This is actually a home movie!  It is shot with a camcorder!  The first five minutes of the movie is just a shot from a camcorder set up on a tripod.  There are no close ups, the camera does not move or cut.  The scene is poorly lit, poorly miced and the actors are off in the distance.  Every other scene is the same.  Often the lighting is so poor you can't see what is going on.  The sound and voices drop in and out, sometimes the characters sound distant other times they are too loud.  The camera always just sits there.  The picture is grainy.  This is a home movie.  I have seen student films better than this and low grade porn with better production values and better performances.  I don't say that as an insult, again, the way phrases like this are usually used in movie reviews, but as the God's honest truth.  In the YouTube generation I realize everyone has a voice and armature film makers have an outlet to show their work.  But home videos should stay on YouTube.  They should not go into the marketplace as ""movies,"" duping unsuspecting buyers at places like Amazon who think they are getting a quality-made flick (again, no one would be expecting ""Star Wars"" quality filmmaking here, but actual, multiple cameras and Hollywood, professional editing equipment are the very least you expect for a movie being sold as an actual movie).  What if I put some crappy movie I made with my pals up at Amazon and charged $20 bucks for it?  Apparently it would be OK.  I really can't believe this is being sold to the public in actual video stores and on sites like this.  Forget the movie itself (I turned the horrendous thing off after 20 minutes), I just want to warn potential buyers (or even renters) this is as close to stealing as Amazon can get.  And it is way past false advertising.",1190851200,6,2284,4.340425531914893
8202642,2,B000RW5CAE,This one was baaaddddd!!!!!!  A typical teen chop fest.,1510531200,,55,5.111111111111111
8202643,3,B000RW5CAE,"It's the 1980's and a group of teenagers are getting together to hold an seance in a haunted house. All the typical 80's horror movie characters are there: The Cool Hero, The Innocent Girlfriend, The Goth Chick, The Tough Guy, The Beautiful Blonde, The Shy Guy in love with the Beautiful Blonde, a couple of Lipstick Lesbians and Two Big Geeks!",1391731200,,344,4.655737704918033
8202644,1,B000RW5CAE,"Catchy title...and that's about it. I can't even say this is an actual movie. It was shot on somebody's phone, and they didn't even bother to light any of the scenes. It was badly under-exposed, which really didn't help with the poor production quality. The only reason I rented this was because of the promised nudity. However, because the DP didn't bring his light kit, I really couldn't see anything. If you shoot a movie using a cheap camera, make sure it is somewhat lit. Even tacky red or blue gels might of worked. It would of made the images more interesting to look at. Good art direction and cinematography is very essential when making a movie. It doesn't have to be on a high-budget scale.",1377734400,,701,4.571428571428571
8202645,1,B000RW5CAE,"Well this movie was looked like it was filmed by handheld commercial Video cameras from the early 80's, Or maybe low grade security cameras. After that..... IT GETS WORSE.  Very low budget haunted house - possessed teenagers movie, dead comming back to life with terrible makeup, and poor acting and dialog.  But hey, all the money they saved on filming and script was apparently put into a fund to get 2 lesbian girls to get half naked and kiss on the floor behind the bed, and get the blonde (who's not nearly as busty as she appears on the cover) to do a minute long Topless chest scrub down while the group nerd stares at here thru the giant bathroom door peephole, then later as a topless zombie.  This Movie so not worth the effort to watch.",1341532800,,747,4.437956204379562
8202646,1,B000RW5CAE,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews. Being a fan of horror satire (SCARY MOVIE etc) I thought this would be a great addition to the ones I already have. It isn't. In fact, it isn't even staying. I'll give it away as soon as I can find some poor unsuspecting soul who'll take it. It was a waste of my time and money.

We have old looking teenagers gathering at a house that has a bad history. The resulting blood/mayhem is predictable and boring. Couple that with bad audio, non-existant effort on camera work, shoddy sets, amature actors and a script that should be shredded, we have a movie here that should come with warning labels. I'm thinking ""DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE"" or ""IF YOU LIKE MOVIES WITH NO BUDGET, NO TALENT, NO HUMOR AND NO REDEEMABLE VALUE THIS MIGHT JUST BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR""

Normally I try to find something good to say about the things I review, but honestly, this one totally defeats me.",1294444800,2,927,4.415204678362573
8202647,3,B000RW5CAE,"Given the title, it's pretty obvious from the get-go that this is going to be a really stupid slasher film, and the opening credits leave no room for doubt by informing viewers that the film was ""shot and cut to hell"" by Jeff  Smith.  (Smith also directed, co-wrote, and otherwise contributed to just about every aspect of the movie.)  If nothing else, you can't criticize Stupid Teenagers Must Die for pretending to be something it's not.  That's good because even the slightest trace of pretension could well have made this movie completely unwatchable.  Obviously, a good many critics and viewers banish it to one-star hell already, but I believe it does have a few entertaining moments - and the gore isn't half-bad for such a low-budget production (I especially liked the range of arterial blood sprays).

Basically, you have a group of teenaged stereotypes lifted right out of the 1980s (i.e., characters) come together in a murder house to conduct a sance.  Naturally, they pool all of their car keys together so no one can up and leave in the middle of things - this becomes a problem because they keys disappear right about the time that the kids start dying grisly deaths.  Despite their collective knowledge that there is a killer in the house (be it one of them or the ghost of the serial killer who lived in the house), the stupid teenagers keep wandering off by themselves - with predictable results.  As the body count rises, the teens begin to turn on one another and conspire among themselves.  The whole thing gets rather silly in the end, but horror geeks - especially those of us who came of age in the 1980s - should appreciate the spoofy goodness and numerous one-liners this film lays down along the way.  I'm not saying this is a good movie - indeed, some horrors fans will undoubtedly hate it - but it does have guilty pleasure potential for those of us with a particularly twisted sense of humor.  I'll definitely take Stupid Teenagers Must Die! over the umpteenth installment of Scary Movie.",1293408000,3,2018,4.717948717948718
8202648,1,B000RW5CAE,"Gawd awful. Any good reviews here are either from the cast or crew, hoping to cash in on royalties or DVD sales. Bad everything...acting, directing, sound, lighting, you name it. - Low budget ""independent"" films can be entertaining. This is just not one of them. It comes off like a bottle of cheap wine. Looks good on the outside but tastes ghastly. Don't waste your time or your money. You'll feel like an idiot, and I don't want to have to say I told you so. You've been warned.",1232323200,2,481,4.415730337078652
8202649,4,B000RW5CAE,"this is a fun and original take on the 80's slasher movie.  it comes in at about 75 minutes, so there's little filler, and though it is working within the constraints of the genre, it finds ways of being inventive so that you don't get the feeling that you've seen this one before.  the production values are atrociously bad, as has been noted by other reviewers, and if that's important to you, avoid this one.  believe it or not, though, this movie's better than the horror-comedy garbage hollywood has been throwing at us, largely because it doesn't take itself so seriously.  if you enjoy b-movies, i think you'll not only enjoy this one, but it'll even surprise you a few times.  (and yes--i've seen the whole thing.)",1217635200,3,722,4.653543307086614
8202650,5,B000RW5CAE,"In this parody/tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980's - a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious Murder McGee, who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard.  As I'm sure you can guess, things go from bad to worse faster than you can say ""Where's the beef??"" and in typical 80's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody, the dialogue is cheesy, and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get.  Good times...

No clique or 80's horror movie clichd characterizations are left unrepresented here.  In fact, no stone was left unturned at all - we have the cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, the Goth chick, the tough thug (think John Bender), the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt, the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt, a couple of gorgeous half-naked lesbians, and two big geeks.

As you can plainly see, the cast is pretty big.  Usually, larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly, with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel.  Not in this case though.  Not a single cast member left me disappointed.  The acting was very well done.  Everyone from the cool hero in his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith to the grooovy Goth chick played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One & Two played by Cory Assink & Jonathan Brett - they all played it straight, brought their A-game, and knocked it out of the park.  If you're a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science, you'll immediately fall in love with the geeks.

Director/co-writer Jeff C. Smith is a guy to watch for in the future, trust me on this.  If this is what he can do with a low budget, there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects.  The characters were dead on; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughs were huge; the blood flowed, and squirted, and sprayed beautifully - it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980's.  Call this one ""THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets NIGHT OF THE DEMONS""!!!

The tag line says it all, and says it honestly - ""EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE; GRATUITOUS NUDITY; ZERO BUDGET"" - no false advertising here, folks!  As fans of this genre, we have to look to the indies and support these hard-working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales, lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered-down PG-13 'horror' or pointless remakes like The Hitcher.  No, thank you - no more of that for me.

In closing, I honestly have to say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE! is by far one of the best indie flicks I've gotten the pleasure of watching this year.  It's a bloody good time, and holds up on repeat viewings.  From the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe...even the closing love theme over the end credits (which if that doesn't bring back fits of laughter recalling mid-80's power ballads by REO Speedwagon - over-pronoucned R's on every word starting with the letter 'R' - then I'll eat my DVD right now)...bottom line is, if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general, no more hesitation - this flick deserves to be in your collection!!",1193356800,5,3210,4.5190311418685125
8202651,4,B000RW5CAE,"STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films I've seen in quite some time. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-writer, cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of underappreciated 80's horror films with this movie! Anyone who loves the cheesiness, preposterous situations, wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the past.

STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the ""excessive violence"" and ""gratuitous nudity"" that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love. I had a blast watching STMD! From the 80's outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone I just couldn't get enough!",1193356800,11,806,5.296875
