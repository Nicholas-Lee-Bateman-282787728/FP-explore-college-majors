175334,5,1401926436,Very happy to have this valuable information available and all Esther & Jerry Hicks share about the law of attraction.,1280275200,5,118,4.95
175335,5,1401926436,"The topics covered here are very relevant to my everyday living, like illness, romance and so on.  It seems every time I see a new sesssion by Abraham, my understanding of the Law of attraction is so much clearer.

Thank you Abraham and Esther.

175336,5,1401926436,"Listen - Feel - Live.  They have the same answer to every question in so many different words so we can all hear.  I have the same review.  Abraham has the answer you have been asking for.  BE HAPPY.  Just find a thought that feels better.  I highly recommend this DVD and any of the others, you will feel like you are there.  AMAZING!",1268784000,26,335,4.140625
175337,5,1401926436,"I thought number IX was my favorite, but this surpasses it.  Abraham went straight to the people and never stopped.  The why's were discussed like the throat cancer reason.  I hope Abraham and Esther keep doing this.  It seems to me to be very helpful, especially since we seem to be so blind to ourselves--or I should say ""I"" and ""myself"".  I know they say we should just start with accepting where we are and do a focus wheel or a rampage to get to a better feeling place, but after watching the DVD's and listening to tapes I think that ""aha"" moment is totally eye and soul opening for everyone.  Bless Esther and Jerry for their great work.

There seem to be couples, a man and a woman team, breaking through - like in the Course in Miracles or Seth.  Even Cayce had his wife to help him in his trances.  However no previous entities has spoken to me like Abraham-Hicks.

I haven't been to a workshop or cruise but I hope to attend.  Meanwhile these DVDs are my answer.  What a joy they are.  They cause me to be in a state of appreciation.",1268438400,68,1044,4.26530612244898
175338,5,1401926436,I love this latest Episode -- just as I love all of the Episodes! I very much appreciate the work and sharings of Abraham-Hicks!,1267920000,6,128,4.375
175339,5,1401926436,"This is the best one so far,leading edge knowledge,it will change your life,it did mine",1267488000,10,87,4.866666666666666
175340,5,1401926436,"I second Louise Hay and Wayne Dyer when they say that the Abraham Hicks teaching are among the most advanced you will find, it's also however the simplest.  Anybody looking to improve their life in any way will find benefit from this DVD.

It's another fabulous addition to the Abraham-Hicks ""Law of Attraction in Action"" series.

My husband says ""More great insights from Abraham to add to my collection""

I just say - Buy the DVD ! If you are new to the Abraham Hicks material it's the best investment you will ever make...........If you are already familiar with their work, you don't need my words to tell you how wonderful this material is........Enjoy !",1267228800,22,659,4.7043478260869565
175341,5,1401926436,"ABRAHAM - Enlightening. Funny. Smart. Pure Love. Brilliant. Infinite Wisdom. Unequivocally caring. Genius. Superb.... What puny words to describe the wisdom of Abraham!

Numerous authors including Louise. L Hay, Dr. Wayne Dyer and Neale Walsch refer to Abraham as the best teachers we have today.

This material is life changing. That is all that needs to be said.
This DVD along with ALL the other Abraham material is nothing short of extraordinary!

I could go on and on about how this material has changed my life in every area... But, as Abraham says, ""Words do not teach. It is only life experience that teaches.""
But words have the potential to influence... and what better words to hear, than those of Abraham!

Today and every day I have nothing but utter appreciation and love for Abraham and what they have come to remind us of. You will feel it resonating within you. For this is not something unknown they are teaching, but something we have merely forgotten.

It is always such a joy to hear/watch Abraham in action!
Life is supposed to feel good!!! Yes indeed!!! :)

Best wishes to all,
Jonathan ^^",1265587200,57,1112,4.765625
175342,5,1401926436,"I could never give anything but a great review for anything Abraham does and Jerry and Esther publish.  Absolutely fabulous.  Abraham/Esther are funny and bring out some great information.  It brought to my attention what is holding me back, now just to get pass this.",1264032000,11,268,4.911111111111111

Plus: Love, sex, Wall Street Economics, throat cancer, finding love in under 30 days, how artists can get paid for what they do, recovering from ""powerless"" substance abuse, a 100th birthday celebration, cravings, and staying centered in a topsy-curvy world.

""The well-being is stronger today than it has ever been. The question is: how much of it are YOU letting in?""

Pure vintage Abraham!

If you like the ""seminar"" approach, this continues with that excellent method of having attendees ask any questions they desire and Abraham wisely, lovingly and humorously giving insight from their unique vantage point.",1359504000,,298,5.953488372093023

175356,5,1401926436,"This book succeeds at analyzing sociological developments in a way that is entertaining because the authors stray from convention, has a knack for unpeeling layers and layers of assumptions and myth and showing the real causes behind trends. They show the hidden influences on our lives--relating to everything, even education, career paths, crime, even real estate. ; why drug dealing is only lucrative for the dealers at the top of the pyramid; the myth that real estate agents are looking for our best interests. The book is breezy and anecdotal, which is an effective format for presenting a lot of sociological trends without being dry.  The lesson of this book is that we should be leery of trusting society's common assumptions or common wisdom. In other words, the book encourages us to keep our mind alert and break out of the mold in the way we see things. By looking at social trends with a fresh eye, the book succeeds at making trends a fun, adventurous endeavor.",1316822400,,976,4.844311377245509

175359,5,1401926436,"THIS IS ANOTHER MUST PURCHASE for those desiring to take responsibility of their life and self improvement.i have purchased and read several of abrahams materials. i love and appreciate them all. the best about this one is how easy it is to understand the teachings, see how they apply to all that is going on in our life, and how to practice them everyday and get to the point where we really do need to take responsibility for choosing deliberately how we think, speak, and respond because it is all our vibration. and vibration creates manifestation. if we change our vibration, we change our manifestation. i like disk two best. i would suggest listening to it if disk one loses your attention. then go back and listen to disk one. but listen again and again and learn. thank you abraham for reminding me of what i already do know. thanks esther and jerry also. i don't think you would be disappointed in this if you are wanting to continue knowing how to dileberately change your life and your thinking, in return changing what you experience. a must purchase if you like abraham teachings.",1295395200,2,1095,4.678756476683938

I have studied metaphysics and mysticism since 1967 and haven't found anything in ""Abraham's"" teachings that is counter to the broad scope of masterful teachings that I have enjoyed.
