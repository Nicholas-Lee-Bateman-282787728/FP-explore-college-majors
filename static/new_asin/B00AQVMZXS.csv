5472542,5,B00AQVMZXS,"The UK version has much more in each episode than the US version. Downton Abby was wonderful as first seen on PBS, but the additional scenes were even better! I'll watch this over and over.",1394841600,,189,4.428571428571429
5472543,5,B00AQVMZXS,"Unless you been hiding under a rock for the last four years, you already know this show is amazing. A brilliant cast paired with a breathtaking setting gives this show such a rich, full feeling that I don't even possess the vocabulary to paint an accurate picture for you in words. I almost pee my pants with excitement at the very sound of the title sequence. THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.",1394668800,,389,4.416666666666667
5472544,5,B00AQVMZXS,"After hearing rave reviews from the press and a few friends, I still had not heard what I needed to pique my desire to watch this series. However, watching a repeat broadcast of a 20/20 episode on ABC News did the trick. The 20/20 episode showed High Clere Castle, the setting for Downton Abbey, as it exists today, and the family who now lives there and is tasked with the business of keeping a business running to support the upkeep of the castle and grounds. The episode also featured bits of scenes from the television series and and discussed the basic themes of the TV series. I realized then that this character driven, period drama that highlights the social stigma between the classes of people that existed in Britain in the 1920s was exactly what I would love to see. The price on Amazon for the whole series was excellent!

If you have any question before you purchase, you could always purchase an  episode or two to watch. It is available through Prime Amazon Streaming, but not for recording; and if you don't have a compatible device, you will not be able to watch in HD. It WILL, however be enough to see if you like what you see. Also, the special features will not be available through streaming.

My husband sat in the den with me and with his computer, glancing back and forth at the TV in spite of himself while I watched the TV and occasionally him. He commented on the fantastic production values, saying that the Downton Abbey DVDs seemed much more like a series of elegant films than a television series. He found himself watching much more than he had planned.

Downton Abbey has immediately become one of our favorites series that we pull out at least once or twice a year. I promise that you won't be disappointed if anything I've written about appeals to you.",1394323200,76,1789,4.546583850931677
5472545,5,B00AQVMZXS,"Very prompt service,the quality for used videos was exceptional,I was concerned them being UK edition but was pleasantly surprised and delighted.",1393632000,3,145,5.9523809523809526
5472546,5,B00AQVMZXS,"The first thing to be said about this series is that it is British from the very first scene to the very last by the vast range of actors and actresses as for age and the extreme quality of these actors, most of them having parallel careers in theaters, television and the cinema. They are thus able to act with a vast variety of stances and tones and at the same time with a great expressivity on their faces or with their body language. Within that great versatility and mental or dramatic agility there is not one single age that is privileged and the older generation is just as good and as present as the youngest one and the age range, apart from the few children, goes from the late teens and early twenties to the seventies. This is exceptional and no American series will ever be able to do that. A TV actor might turn up in the cinema but then he will never go back to TV, and both will hardly be able to work on a stage. The case of ""Harry Potter,"" or Daniel Radcliffe if you prefer, is typically British who can play on the stage or act in a film. That mobility is not American, and American television sure misses something there, just as much as it misses the use of older actors and actresses, as well as very young ones, leveling the cast within a twenty to thirty years age bracket.

The second element that makes this series beautifully and exceptionally British is the fact it is situated before, during and after the First World War in England and everything is there to tell you, you are in England. The Mansion in which the action takes place, the official Downton Abbey, which is of course not the real name, the village next to it, the array of vehicles and cars, the steam engine and the train, even the London of that time, all is reconstructed the way it was or used to be. Only England can have that Tudor architecture. It is in no way similar to anything anywhere else in the world and if there is something looking like it in the USA, it is nothing but a copy, hence a fake, or maybe, like the old London Bridge, a rejected ruin that was bought over here and brought and rebuilt over there, in a piece of desert even.

The third element is the society it depicts. There is the upstairs of the aristocrats, lords, ladies, duchesses, earls and so on that is so English in its vanity, social exclusiveness, social segregation, social racism even. And there is the downstairs of the servants, the copy cat hierarchy of the service from the butler at the top to the housekeeper at the top too, then to the valets and the footmen on one side, and to the maids and kitchen hands on the other side, and with some hierarchy within each echelon of this social descending ladder. To be in the service was a great honor and privilege and one could spend one's whole life in it and climbing the rungs of that ladder one at a time over the decades. But this series is exceptional because it goes far beyond that simple capture of social stratification.

The main lady, the wife of the Earl has an American mother, and brother (not very much present in the series), and this American line is always the source of some humor more than anything else, though of course it is also the source of a lot of money and opportunities.

The chauffeur of the estate is Irish, a republican socialist what's more, and he falls in love with one of the three daughters and she would have eloped if her father had not accepted to change his mind. This daughter will die in childbirth and the Irish socialist ex-chauffeur who is thus the father of a little girl who is a blood relative of the family is accepted in this circle but as the one who is going to take over the management of the estate, hence a full time job, and yet he does not feel at home really. But he finds a real position because of what he is doing: saving the English aristocracy from being bankrupt and run over by the capitalists, by becoming capitalists themselves, with the help of a new generation of non-aristocrats who break all kinds of rules just because they can since they are not aristocrats.

The heir of the estate is a non aristocrat (he inherits the estate but not the title) but his fate is tragic though he provides the family with a very much desired male heir. His wife, the oldest daughter, is a very strange character though she might be able to change and evolve with the world, especially after the war because England has to change fast if they want to avoid some social upheaval.

The general picture here is fascinating.

In the same way what is happening downstairs is fascinating with love and hatred, with spying and plotting, of all sorts, even a rape here and there to pepper and salt the scene, a few violent crimes too, well disguised if possible. Not to speak of a possible divorce that is not brought to its fulfillment because the woman dies in the mean time. Bleak and dark, and yet some women in that set of servants are outstandingly honest and humane. This world is a world of its own and that too is interesting.

All together this series is a lot more fascinating than I have said because of these numerous and varied levels of social norms and taboos that are broken or challenged by a set of extremely good actors and actresses that make the show a real gem of television production. Note the way the Prince of Wales who was to become a king who married a divorcee and was obliged to abdicate because of it is ridiculed, is absolutely funny, though that more or less covers his bad political reputation since he was on Hitler's side, more or less, and to show him as having the most careless and freewheeling morality you can imagine for a future king justifies the fact that he was nicely pushed aside. It could not be done with more humor, though very cruel humor for that prince who has to acknowledge what could have been a scandal and his obligation to owe one to a set of aristocrats who used the skills of their servants to salvage a situation that was desperate. The London season is really funny then.

5472547,2,B00AQVMZXS,I watch the first two seasons and when I went to watch seasons 3&4 they were for Europe only. How can you reason this I bought all four seasons in a box set and it said that you could view it in the US.  What a pain had to send back etc.  I know that they offer 3& 4 for the US on PBS should have stayed with them.,1390780800,13,314,3.536231884057971
5472548,5,B00AQVMZXS,"Firstly two things to note before you buy this one. This is a Region 2 (European) box set and is only going to play on a Region 2 or Region Free DVD player. Secondly, this does not include the 2013 Christmas Special as it has not been aired at the time of release. However, if you wait for the Region 1 (North American) which will presumably released at some stage it will be included.

A new series of Downton is an annual treat, and as usual this year it is followed by the DVD compendium released just in time to give as a very welcome Christmas present. This includes the 33 episodes to date. There are seven episodes from the first series, eight each from the second, third and fourth, plus the 2011 and 2012 Christmas specials of which the first was a dramatic masterpiece, but the second did not deliver in the same way in the opinion of most people although it ended dramatically.

The four series so far have taken us from 1912, just after the sinking of the Titanic, up to 1922. Each of the four series to date has had a slightly different background. Series 1 takes us to a very formal setting within the household with much concern about match making for the Crawley daughters to find them suitable partners which will secure the financial future of the estate. However, those above stairs are generally shown in largely a sympathetic light in their relationship with their servants below stairs and this sets the scene for the whole subsequent series.

The second series takes us through World War 1. Downton Abbey has been converted into a convalescent home for servicemen injured in the conflict. This quite different scenario provided the script writers with some interesting stories and the series runs from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 up to the end of the war in 1918.

The first Christmas special and the third series take place from late 1919 into 1920. The first features a very dramatic trial and this was probably the single best episode so far. In the third series the household is far more back to the life of an aristocratic family as it was in the first series although the estate faces major challenges in the post war period and a need to embrace change if Downton is to survive.

The second Christmas special sees most of the action move to Scotland, and a tragic conclusion which shocked most viewers and rather put a blight on Christmas Day for many. The fourth series takes us a little further into the 1920s and some relaxation of the divisions between those above and below stairs is obvious, although it still all looks like a rigid division to our contemporary eyes.

A major source of story lines for the script writers has been the interaction between those below stairs and those above stairs. Quite a few of the main characters in both groups have been in Downton from the beginning and there are some very strong performances. However, I am not sure things would be the same without Maggie Smith as the matriarch of the family and she continues to dominate any scene she is in.

If you are interested in the additional features, this DVD set includes all the extra features which were on the individual season releases. These amount to several hours of additional viewing.

Personally I have been an avid follower of Downton Abbey from the first series and have seen every episode to date. I have now started to enjoy reruns of the earlier episodes. However, if you have missed out so far, then this DVD set is an excellent introduction to probably the best costume TV drama in recent times. Prospective purchasers should be aware that there will be a further Christmas Special later this year which is not included on this DVD set and there will inevitably be further seasons of the show, so whilst this is the definitive box set to date it will not remain so.",1384646400,27,3807,4.588235294117647

5472771,5,B00AQVMZXS,"Downton Abbey has got to be, IMHO, one of the finest TV series shows ever produced. As you watch, season to season, the characters become more and more real and, for many, much more complex, and everyone I know who watches Downton has their favorites, for a variety of quite different reasons. There are definitely scenes that will make you quite happy, and, conversely, quite sad. The series, at one time or another, touches on about every emotion that a person has. This is one of two TV shows that I own the entire lot on Blu-Ray (the other being Game of Thrones) so that I am able to watch whenever I want, but also so that I may loan to others to enjoy. This four season Blu-Ray package is very highly recommended, great quality visuals and sound.",1441756800,,752,4.456521739130435

Accustomed privileges based on a birthright are perfectly applauded by movie-makers by instantly showing merciful, gentle, caring elite accommodating generously plebs born to know their place near dirt while creative intelligent, requiring intellect jobs are for a genetically-predetermined upper class.

Each frame of the video for Blu-Ray was sharp as expected (that is why I ordered the Blu-Ray version) but the action was presented in a jerky manner.  It was like short pieces of video were cut from a complete video and then put back together with many short pieces missing. The video was so jerky that it cannot be watched for even a short period of time.  I stop after 5 minutes and repackaged it to be returned.

Whether this is defect affecting all Downton Abby in the Blu-Ray product or just this copy  I do not know.  However this copy is not watchable and is to be returned.",1430784000,,776,4.384615384615385

5473302,4,B00AQVMZXS,"I have watched and enjoyed Downtown Abbey on PBS' Masterpiece Theater since the beginning. However, a dear friend of mine mentioned in passing that she'd never seen the show and was interested in ""catching up"" on seasons 1-4 before watching season 5. As her birthday was coming up, I went into Amazon and bought the boxed set, and presented it to her as a gift; she was delighted. I just heard from her the other day; she says that she's been watching the shows and has proclaimed the Downton Abbey boxed set (seasons 1 through 4) the ""best birthday present, ever!""",1428624000,,565,4.603960396039604
5473303,5,B00AQVMZXS,"Not enough pleasant adjectives for an accurate declaration of my opinion.  Great period piece!  Magnificent characters and character development.  One minute I'm caught up in what I'm sure is very serious business, the next I'm laughing at the sheer nerve it took to be so campy.  Mr. Fellowes is a master storyteller, and cudos to him for not taking himself too seriously!  A complete pleasure from Episode 1 of Season 1 straight through to the end.  I love all things DA.!  Not just the films, but the books for each season are marvelously filled with Julian Fellowes footnotes and anecdotal notations.  I'd say this series has to be one of my true pleasures of this decade.",1428624000,,676,4.767241379310345

5473326,1,B00AQVMZXS,"I used to love Downton Abbey.  But in season 4 they spent who knows how much to bring in Kiri Te Kanawa the famous opera singer to play Nellie Melba the famous opera singer who was too big a star to play house parties to play a house party, the only dramatic purpose of which was to drag everyone into one room so that Anna Bates, a beloved character, could be brutally raped in the kitchen of a house where otherwise no one ever had any expectation of privacy and her screams couldn't possibly not be heard.  That's just cheap, sleazy soap opera emotional manipulation, not respectable drama.",1428537600,,593,4.481481481481482

These were two very significant scenes to be excluded.  I feel that I purchased an incomplete set. I don't understand why there are so many renditions of this popular series. Very confusing for the consumer. I did read other reviews and was aware of similar complaints.
