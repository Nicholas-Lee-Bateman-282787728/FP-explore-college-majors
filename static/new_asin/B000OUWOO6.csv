Of course, now they define 'super star' as 'super hero' and he's been cast in many bad man/dark movies since this. So the fresh innocence, raw talent and ability of the way he connects with his viewers and reaches into your heart is apparent and much loved here. This movie is 'dated' but somehow still hits the mark. Light movie overall.",1465603200,,468,4.650602409638554
8186778,5,B000OUWOO6,"This excellent movie get 5 stars, but this edition does not have subtitles. I mistakenly assumed it did, since it's being sold to a US market! I had to send it back.",1445385600,,165,4.1875

8186781,5,B000OUWOO6,I see now why it is also one of Shah Rukh's favorite of his films. Yes I think it was one of his best performances also. And besides being so talented in every aspect he was and is a very handsome and charismatic man/actor. So glad i bought this film.,1383609600,4,251,4.04
8186782,4,B000OUWOO6,It is a lesson on selflessness. I a sure this movie does not appeal to Westerners much but it has a very profound message.,1379462400,2,122,4.125
8186783,4,B000OUWOO6,"You can find movie reviews elsewhere - just in terms of the disk itself, I was afraid the image quality might be bad since the movie is older, but the transfer is fine and subtitles are available in English.",1370476800,2,207,4.333333333333333
8186784,5,B000OUWOO6,"Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa is a treasure, if you are a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. As is typical of his earlier films, Shah Rukh Khan is young and full of energy in this film. This film is cheery, pleasant and will be fun for all ages of viewers to see.  This is one of my favorites!",1334880000,5,272,3.7719298245614037
