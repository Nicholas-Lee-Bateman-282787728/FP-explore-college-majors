1379882,5,B00004Z4SO,"This one has my favorite episode on it... #7, ""Unexpected Partings,"" I believe. Ah! I just love that one. I mean, how can I resist Dilandau-sama destroying a city while screaming ""moecha"" (burn) at the top of his lungs? *grin* Okay, okay, serious review. I reccomend this series highly. It's a very beautiful show with exquisite animation and a very complex plot. It's amazing that it all fits in 26 episodes, I think. The characters may have noses the size of the Empire State Building, but I'm willing to overlook that fact because half the characters are so darn GORGEOUS anyhow (like Folken or Dilandau or Allen or Yukari [yes, you heard me, Yukari =P]...yumminess... ^_^). This show is very detailed in a way most anime isn't, even showing little things like the citzens' reaction at having their houses shoot up in flames...come on, do you see that in, say, Sailor Moon? Anyway, it's easily my favorite anime ever, even topping Evangelion and Mononoke-Hime (both of which I also love). I'm glad that it's finally been released comercially with subtitles, and it's obviously a goldmine for the company that did so...",980553600,5,1121,4.87434554973822
1379883,5,B00004Z4SO,"One of the best anime's I've ever seen, and one I can't recommend enough. My wife and I saw this at a local anime convention and stayed up all weekend to catch the 8 episodes shown. Buying the box set beat out the grocery money, ramen for a week was worth it. A great story, great animation, and an amazing soundtrack. I'm waiting for the boxed DVD set before I go out and buy it on DVD. If you like NGE, this'll be right up your alley. Avoid the Fox version, they should be charged with assault for what they did to it. My only complaint is the pinnochio syndrome, what's with those noses? The previous reviewer was right on target, Yoko Kanno's work with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra is simply awesome, John Williams should give this a listen so he could relearn how soundtracks should be done. I've also heard that this was ""in response"" to NGE, Escaflowne actually predates NGE, and besides, what's the problem with having 2 great anime series about mecha?",980467200,2,965,4.52
1379884,5,B00004Z4SO,"To tell you the truth, the only reason I bought a DVD player was because I heard that Escaflowne and Slayers were being released on DVD! Having Bilingual DragonBall DVDs released didn't hurt either (you'll never catch me with a English only DBZ DVD! =P). These three series are my all-time favorites. Anyway, I think this DVD has some of the interesting episodes of Escaflowne. For some reason I just really like the episode where Van is taken prisoner by Zaibach. I don't know why... Anyway I think that it is GREAT that we can finally see Escaflowne in practically perfect quality(you want perfect, get a laserdisc), and I can barely wait for the whole series to finish being released. I guess there is some benefit to having an English dub after all... if it weren't for the dub, the DVDs would have never been released...",978134400,,825,4.657534246575342
1379885,5,B00004Z4SO,"Oh Migel Labariel, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways....This review is slightly off-topic. Escaflowne is a gorgeous 26 episode Anime show. The official english name is ""Vision of Escaflowne"". The girl on the cover is Hitomi (she's a pretty cool 15 year old from Japan who is transported to a world called Gaea seemingly accidentally) the boy is the hero of the series, the brave and sometimes fool-hardy young king of Fanelia (I'm so mean to him!) His name is Van Sleazer de Fanel, oops, it's actually ""Slanzer"" ;-) and behind the two of them is the powerful and mystical mech, called Escaflowne. Let me just take this oportunity to say that Esca. is so wonderful because of its complex and fascinating characterizations. The villains suffer at the hands of the hero, but the heroes are hurt physically/emotionally by the villains...and somewhere in between obsession turns into passion...or not--don't flame me! Perhaps what makes Escaflowne my favourite is that it has a character named Dilandau Albatou. He, like Van and Hitomi, is 15. Dilandau (Dilly) is quite simply, insane...and gorgeous beyond description. The intense hatred that Dilandau has for Van and vice-versa is electrifying and breath-taking. I love Esca (and trust me, I'm the ONLY nutcase out there) and I have no doubt that you will too. BTW, have I mentioned that the Escaflowne men are heavenly handsome? Very drool-worthy ;-)",978048000,,1406,4.987234042553191
1379886,5,B00004Z4SO,"""Club Escaflowne""! One of the things I really love about the DVD format is the little extras that usually come along with it. The first Escaflowne DVD had a set of beautiful music videos set to music from the series. This disk as a really fun interview with the Japanese voice actors for Merle, Hitomi, Van and Folken called ""Club Escaflowne"". (Warning to people who haven't seen the whole series yet, they do reveal a major plot point that may ""spoil"" some things for you) The actors really have a lot of fun joking and teasing back and forth as they chat about the series, funny stories about themselves, and more. Even if you have the series on VHS already, I consider this feature, along with the durabilty (escaflowne is a series you'll watch over and over) and beauty of the DVD format to be a reason to get this disk.",977443200,3,824,4.4635761589403975
1379887,5,B00004Z4SO,"If you have never seen an anime before, then this is the one to fall in love with.  The Vision of Escaflowne is a powerful animated series that filled with action, suspense, and plenty of philosophical dilemmas.  The story revolves around an average girl named Hitomi who travels to Gaea, a mystical world where the Earth is the moon.
The reason that this anime stands above all else is the musical scores composed by Yoko Kanno that falls perfectly with every scene and every battle.  Each movement is composed with the perfect form to help motivate the characters, or set a perfect scene.  (I bought the soundtrack and listen to it everyday)  The story and animation behind Escaflowne is also one of the best in anime series.  The Guymelfs look awesome in the combat scenes that seem to be lifelike.
I already have the original series plus the Movie on VCD, but I am still going to purchase the DVD's.  Its really that good, and I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.",971308800,5,970,4.508571428571429
1379888,5,B00004Z4SO,"Let me just start by saying that Escaflowne (Visions of Escaflowne) is not your typical anime TV series.  If you have not yet seen the original uncut version and are only watching the FOX version, you are really missing out.  This series has drama, incredible action sequences, and the music that will pull you completely into the story.  Oh yes, and the animation is better than most other TV series, especially during the mecha battle sequences.  The characters are extremely interesting, and they seem to display emotion and react as real people would in their various situations.  This series is also very deep and sometimes may seem a little confusing to you.  The plot has many secrets and surprises in store for you.  However, trust me, no matter how confusing the series may get, everything will come together in the end.  This is the second DVD release for Escaflowne which will continue the excellent story, and I can't wait to get my hands on it.  This is the original uncut version with all of the video and music in its right place.  And it's on DVD, which means that it will last you a lifetime, and you will get to see the crisp animation as it is meant to be seen with sharpness that only DVD can display.  If there has ever been a reason to buy a DVD player, this series is it.  I would reccommend Escaflowne to any anime fan, and especially fans of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gundam Wing, or other mecha series.  I think that fans of those series will love the medievel spin put on the mecha in the Escaflowne series.  So, do yourselves a favor and make sure that you have some money reserved for this DVD when it is released.",969753600,16,1642,4.503378378378378
7928028,5,B00004Z4SO,Arrived in great condition and is ust a wonderful throwback to my childhood. I missed this show and for a long time didn't remember its name from its short run on For Kids. So glad that I can watch the whole series whenever I want. The characters are cute and the tension is always there. A fast paced story with lots of action that is almost always going on. I just love this series!,1418601600,,384,4.202702702702703
7928029,4,B00004Z4SO,"Van is captured by the Zaiback Empire. Allen, Hitomi, and the rest of the gang make a rescue attempt. When they arrive, they manage to set Van free. On the way out, they encounter Van's brother. This raises questions about Van's past and future. The group retreats to the country of Astoria, where Allen is reunited with the infatuated Princess Milerna. Her relationship and honesty about her feelings for Allen make Hitomi jealous. Her heart is confused, she is torn between her budding feelings for Allen and her old crush back home.

This volume gets a little better than the 1st. The characters gain more depth, and the story gets more complicated. There is also much more action. I think that there is something here for every anime fan to love. I am watching it again after almost 10 years. I have become spoiled by the super amazing animation we have seen in the past several years, so it's taking time to get used to this again. The story is still great though. I think every anime fan should give this series a chance.",1358726400,,1027,4.581521739130435
7928030,5,B00004Z4SO,"One of the things I will probably mention in several of my reviews of this series is that it is really a 'series,' not just a string of episodes with a dramatic ending.  Themes and characters are developed over time, story arcs weave together, and each episode builds on the previous.  With the kind of production effort that has gone into Escaflowne, success is a forgone conclusion.  Not just success, but the kind of richness that makes for greatness.
When Van turns Escaflowne into a dragon and leads off Allen and Hitomi's pursuers it puts him face to face with his brother Folken, who failed the Fanelian test for kingship and fled to the Zaibach Empire.  We discover that, as unappetizing as Folken's agenda is, it springs from honorable motives.  This dichotomy between to forms of duty will haunt this series, providing as it does the seeds of redemption.
Eventually the flurry of rescues and escapes leads everyone to Palas, the capital of Arturia.  But, there is no peace there.  The Asturian king is squirming in the grasp of Zaibach and quickly proves his own untrustworthiness.  Hitomi discovers that Allen, whom she is falling in love with, has some kind of pre-existing relationship.  While this is unclear, Hitomi's confusion over her feelings for a boy back on Earth, Allen and Van is completely apparent.  Thus will fate, desire, and duty play repeatedly in these relationships.
Art, animation and music continue to be top grade.  I was struck in this DVD with the fine work done to bring Escaflowne to life, reminiscent of Evangelion, but a notch better.  The kind of choreography used isn't just a delight to watch, it is expensive to use, underlying Kazuke Akane's commitment again.  There is an interview with many of the lead voice stars that, amidst a lot of kidding around, reveals that Akane is not the only one who is determined to make something special of this series.",1050278400,2,1898,4.820987654320987
7928031,5,B00004Z4SO,"With the first four episodes of ""Escaflowne"", ""Dragons and Destiny"" captured our imaginations and prepared us for what could possibly be a monumental anime series. The second DVD, ""Betrayal and Trust"", expands upon the first DVD in every way and yet still hints that there is much more to be explored along the way.
By now, Hitomi is pretty much a part of the turmoil going on in Gaea, whether she likes it or not. On the run with Allen and Van from the sinister Dilandau, her mysterious powers begin to grow and play a much larger role than with her simple Tarot card readings. And while Van has to contend with the fact that his long-lost brother Folken has betrayed his country, Hitomi tries to deal with her possible love of Allen, who already appears to have a lover in the form of Princess Millerna. And all the while, Dilandau schemes and acts rashly in his unstable and almost insane mood.
Like the previous four episodes, the next four episodes play out at a very reasonable pace. Things slow down enough for back story and characterization to take place, but the plot moves along somewhat faster than most other anime series. Thankfully, the overall effect is a finely balanced series that doesn't sacrifice one thing for the other. And considering there are still 18 episodes left in the series, one can only guess what extraordinary and imaginative ideas this series can come up with next.
Visually, ""Escaflowne"" is one of the better looking series on the market today. While colors may not be as sharp as many of the series that are coming out these days, the series still manages to hold up on its own with its unique art direction and wonderful character designs. And when the series wants to look good, it can look good. Definately something anime fans demanding quality eye-candy can enjoy.
Audio-wise, you know you can almost always expect greatness when Yoko Kanno does the soundtrack. With her eclectic and mastereful genius, she has crafted music that is a league of its own. From orchestral to choral and back again, she truly knows how to make a great anime series even greater.
As for the English dub (provided by the Oceans Group of ""Gundam Wing"" fame), this set of episodes reveals where the dub actually starts to get good. While the dubbing of the first set of episodes wasn't terrible, the voice actors failed to completely develop their characters and thus sounded stale at times. With ""Betrayal and Trust"", they finally manage to get into their roles, and by episode eight they sound emotional and vibrant. Sub fans may argue about certain choices of VAs for some characters, but dub fans and sub fans with an open mind should find the ""Escaflowne"" dub acceptable.
As for extras, the second DVD has a set of interviews of the four main Japanese voice actors. Any fan of ""Escaflowne"" would be insane to pass this up, but be forewarned. These interviews contain many spoilers (the DVD even gives a clear warning of this) so it would be best for newcomers especially to watch the entire series before even looking at this.
Overall, ""Betrayal and Trust"" in an excellent continuation of the first four series. The story is progressing nicely, characters are developing marvelously, and the dub is starting to sound more enthusiastic. Die-hard anime fans would be insane to pass up this epic, and even casual anime fans need to look into this show at least once. There is a reason, after all, why many people call this the ""Saving Private Ryan"" of anime.",1038960000,,3479,4.733113673805601
7928032,5,B00004Z4SO,"This is a fun series to watch.
You kind of feel sorry for Hitomi, your sucked into a mystical land where people fight in giant suits of armor called Guymelefs and there's constant fighting and people are dying and theres animal people to.
It took me awhile to get this whole set. I would of prefered to get it as a box set, but still I really enjoyed this series.
My favourie character is Dilandau he's one bad guy totaly vicious he mows through guys on the battle battlefield just to get to Van his main anemy the only one he cares about fighting.
I really recomend this series for all to watch.",1017187200,4,596,4.283185840707965

7928034,5,B00004Z4SO,"The first episode I saw of Escaflowne was episode 4 and my first impressions weren't too gr8 but my brother bought this DVD so I decieded to watch it anyway. After we watched the whole DVD I thought too myself ""Hey this anime is pretty good after all"" so it was this DVD got me into the Escaflowne series. Episode 5 is where Van finds out who his brother is, Episode 6 is when Hitomi meets Milerna and she believes that Allen and her are a couple until the next episode when we find out Milerna is getting married, but not to Allen. Hitomi thinks Allen is available until she is heartbroken from what she see's (it's sad that bit) and to make matters worse, Hitomi is sold off and Van rescues her but then Dilanduo appears, but Escaflowne changes into a dragon and flys them to safety. In episode 8 Hitomi wakes up from a strange dream and near the end of the episode, the angel in Hitomi's dream saves her from near death and so the DVD ends. My fave episode is probably 8 and I recommend this DVD to any1! Go buy it!",996105600,4,1018,4.198979591836735
7928035,5,B00004Z4SO,"If you haven't seen it, folks, you MUST! I first encountered Escaflowne while flipping through the channels on TV one afternoon. This was when I did NOT like anime. I saw that Escaflowne was on and I thought to myself, ""Oh, great! Another anime show that they are making me avoid!"". But one time, there was absolutely nothing else on and I was tired from a long days work, so I just sat down and watched it. It was the episode where Hitomi first meets Allen in the forest when he 'rescues' her from Mr. Mole. I was hooked. I mean, who wouldn't be? The plot moved fast and it was exciting and made you want to find out what happened and Allen was a babe, right? So then I watched it without fail every Saturday morning. Then stupid Fox takes it off the air right after it was getting to its peak! At least you can buy the dubbed version now. And they just realeased the last videos! Aren't you glad? I personally favour the dubbed version of Escaflowne because I watched it on TV that way and I didn't want to have to readjust to the subtitled version halfway through the series. Escaflowne is one of the most emotional, violently exciting and epic animes ever created. Even my parents agree that it has a plot to rival that of the best movies (and they hate anime!). So why not give it a try? I did! And now I am an otaku (anime fan) and have many other animes that I love! Go for it! What are you waiting for!?",992822400,,1411,4.210332103321033
7928036,5,B00004Z4SO,"Escaflowne has all the snippits of my favorite animes arranged in such a way that I couldn't resist falling in love with the series.  The story is complex, the scenery is rich, and the characters will sweep you off their feet with their swordplay and romance.  Of course, those large fighting machine lovers are pleased as well.  Escaflowne itself can satisfy your taste for a splash of violence here and there.  Mix, serve, enjoy!  Collect all the Escaflowne!",990662400,,460,4.846153846153846
