We can watch here in the USA on Lifetime,  so what  is the problem?  For heavens sake  make  this available please...it just doesn't make sense.",1391299200,7,275,4.2745098039215685
3966761,4,B002QD9RIK,"Sarah Wynter plays the wife of a prison governor who has his eye set on becoming Mayor and thence State Governor. A prisoner, Jack Carlson, called to fix Melanie's car abducts her and takes her to a cabin in the woods. The dynamic of the relationship between captor and captive changes when Carlson tells Melanie that her husband arranged her abduction as a part of a plot to have her killed. Melanie is increasingly attracted to Carlson and no longer poses any kind of threat to him. Now Carlson is in prison for murder, but he was framed by his ex-wife and her lover. The supposed victim is in fact alive and well, and Carlson has broken free from jail to find him and expose the truth. The action and twists in the plot make this a romantic thriller well worth watching.",1362268800,8,773,4.450704225352113

8377685,5,B002QD9RIK,"I love this movie!  Have it permanently on DVR, unless something happens to the player....(knock on wood).  Have been searching and waiting for this movie to be available on DVD for REGION 1.  I saw this and thought OMG, finally, until I noticed it was for region 2.  I was willing to spend $24.95 for this movie and I never spend over @$10 for a dvd.  Great movie plot, wonderful performances by some really great actors.  Please start selling this on a Region 1 dvd for those of us waiting so patiently.  I am not the only one.",1392336000,7,529,4.336734693877551
