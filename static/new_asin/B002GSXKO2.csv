### ABOUT THE 4 FILM FAVORITES SERIES ###

Warner Brothers/New Line's ""4 Film Favorites"" is a line of two-disc sets consisting of four films that are part of a series/franchise or center around a common theme.  Each disc is dual-sided, with the contents of each side being a bit-for-bit copy (a ""disc image"") of a previous DVD release.  Usually the very first DVD release of a film is used as the master for each side, which could be either single-layer or dual-layer.  If the DVD master that is used first came out at the infancy of DVD production (the late 1990s), there may be little to no extras, and even a poor film transfer when compared to a later re-release.  Also, if that original release was a two-disc set, or a dual-sided disc (see: Lethal Weapon 4), only Disc 1 or Side A will be used.  The ""4 Film Favorites"" line is priced with the budget-conscience consumer in mind, with Target having the lowest price at 9.99 each (occasionally on sale for 8.99).  Other stores will inevitably be priced higher, though I don't recommend paying more than ten dollars for each two-disc set.

3925195,5,B002GSXKO2,"So far, Chris Tucker and director Brett Ratner have collaborated together on four wildly entertaining action comedies, which are included in this collection.  Money Talks (1997), Rush Hour (1998), Rush Hour 2 (2001), and Rush Hour 3 (2007), are each on a separate DVD.  All four discs are mounted to a single spindle in the center of the case.  If you care about the condition of the discs, you will probably want to find an alternate way of storing them, as they tend to get scratched up when mounted on a single spindle.

Chris Tucker's outrageous onscreen persona, usually works best when paired with a more conventional type personality.  Charlie Sheen has this role in Money Talks, playing an investigative TV reporter, while martial arts superstar Jackie Chan, is Tucker's partner in the Rush Hour trilogy, films which took the ""buddy cop"" genre to a whole new level.

Each of these films is a winner.  Tucker is a more loose and raw in Money Talks, but his comedic talent is clearly evident.  In Rush Hour, Tucker clearly demonstrates that he is ready for stardom.  His partnership with Chan is a unique symbiotic relationship, which brings out the best in each performer.  Their chemistry together is special, and just so much fun to watch.

Having appeared in only one non-Rush Hour film since 1998, at this point in Chris Tucker's career, the Rush Hour series has come to define a significant section of it.  His growth and maturity is evident in the later films, as is an improvement in Tucker's fighting skills.

Jackie Chan's physical abilities are near legendary, but despite making movies in America for many years, Chan's lack of fluency in the English language has been an impediment to his achieving greater success.  The partnership with Tucker, creates new comedic opportunities, and expands the fan base for each actor.  Employing a similar formula, Chan would later team with Owen Wilson, in the action comedies&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shanghai-Noon-2000-and-Shanghai-Knights-2003/dp/B00BIKY0HK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shanghai Noon (2000) and Shanghai Knights (2003)</a>.

This set is a great buy for casual fans of Tucker, Ratner, Chan, or the Rush Hour franchise, as you get four movies at a very low price.  Unfortunately, the versions of Rush Hour 2 and Rush Hour 3, are stripped down with minimal bonus features.  Serious Rush Hour fans, many want to consider either the Bluray edition of the films, or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rush-Hour-Three-Film-Collection/dp/B004H83IOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rush Hour: Three Film Collection</a>, which features DVD editions of Rush Hour 2 and Rush Hour 3, that contain additional bonus features.",1411344000,,2774,5.548693586698337

3925235,4,B002GSXKO2,"This was a real deal -- 4 movies, and for about $11.  So if 3 of them are at least pretty entertaining (and with Jackie Chan & Chris Tucker, it's difficult to miss), then it's definitely worth it. I loved the Rush Hour Movies, and had only seen #2, a long time ago, on the big screen(and still bigger than almost everyone's huge flat screen monitor).  And 1 & 3 were really fun as well. I'm not very good at rating; other people have different preferences, and it's tough to recommend a flick. But I'd certainly watch any of these over again, in maybe 6 months to a year, depending...  And ""Money Talks"" wasn't a bad movie, either; just not my taste so much. Overall, this seems like a really good deal.",1372291200,,703,4.3106060606060606

On top is rush hour 1, then rush 2, 3 , then on the bottom is money talks.  My had no scratches and no lag what so ever when I watched rush hour. The quality depends on your own opinion but you have to buy it in order to see it.

Was it worth it??
Yes. Simple :) Jackie Chan is a great actor and all time favorite for me! If you want to watch all rush hours then this is a must!",1360800000,,552,3.5833333333333335

The Rush Hour Trilogy gives you comedy and ""kung fu"" in three action packed areas from Los Angeles, to Hong Kong, to Las Vegas, and Paris. Money talks brings you back to a good U.S. based situation with 2 guys stuck in the middle of a smuggled money/shootout situation where more than one group wants the money. This is a great deal. The one problem is that some people may have trouble with these discs since the 4 of them are stacked on top of each other.",1344211200,,541,4.262135922330097

Unlike the former sets (which had 2 double sided discs in a flipper case), the discs included in this one are from the original releases (four regular discs on a long spindle).

The Rush Hour movies are nice ""popcorn"" flicks; a good mix of action and comedy (with funny blooper reels at the end of each), and have some consistency too (same director, musician, actor playing the captain, etc). I haven't watched Money Talks yet...it's gotten pretty bad reviews but DOES have the same director (Brett Ratner) and musician (Lalo Schifrin) as the RH movies, and thus is a good addition to the set.",1328140800,,734,4.825396825396825

Classic Rush Hour is worth the price alone, then you also get the second one which is almost as good, and the 3rd one which is definitely worth watching, but not as great as the first.  Money Talks was a surprise!  I hadn't seen this movie in years and it was surprisingly funny and action packed!  All around, this is a great package, with a great price.  Buy it for you, or someone you know.  Comes on 2 disks, front and back of course.  Quick shipment too.",1292976000,,568,4.242990654205608
