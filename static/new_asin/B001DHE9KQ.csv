3529666,5,B001DHE9KQ,"I'm surprised by the critical reviews of Karita Mattila's performance as Manon Lescaut although I've never seen her before, so I had nothing to compare her to.  (Wrong!  She is the star of my favorite production of Fidelio!)  I thought she was perfect!  She held nothing back in her acting or singing and during the entire performance I kept thinking she is the best I've seen.  Admittedly, she is too old for the part but so is Marcello Giordani, who was excellent also.

I was impressed with all the singers.  Dwayne Croft was excellent as Lescaut and Dale Travis was great as Geronte.  I could picture him as Baron Ochs in Strauss' Rosenkavalier.  Sean Panikkar was the best Edmondo I've ever seen.  I even thought the lamplighter, Tony Stevenson, was good.  The chorus was also good.  No weak links anywhere.

The sets and period costumes were excellent. The music was perfect.

This is a great production.  I've seen many Manon Lescaut's and this one is one of the best.",1231977600,13,975,4.686390532544379
3529667,1,B001DHE9KQ,"The previous reviewer has said it all, but in a much kinder way.  This is a terrible perversion of Manon Lescaut.  I can't think of anything as bad, except that awful M/22 Seraglio, but at least that was well staged and sung!!!  I thought Astrid Weber was barely competent as a singer and a horrible actress.  She displayed no innocence from the outset.  On her way to a convent?  Oh, come on!  Geronte was played by Kouta Rasanen, who looks like he's barely old enough to vote.  Zurab Zurabishvili, Des Grieux, would be okay as a concert singer, but his acting skills are poor.  No one in the cast was the least bit likeable.  The updated staging made the whole thing even more absurd.  Does France still ship her harlots to Louisiana?

The only good thing I can say about this production is that Puccini's music was still excellent.",1231891200,5,834,4.523489932885906
3529668,4,B001DHE9KQ,"For me, there is just something about Manon Lescaut that is deeply moving.  So I admit that I am hard to disappoint when it comes to performances of Puccini's first big hit.  Still, I consider myself to be pretty critical and picky, even if I get a little sentimental.  I personally think this version easily competes with other DVDs available, and not just because of the musical performances.

I attended this performance live at a local movie theatre and was quickly drawn into the compelling, unrelenting melancholy of this opera.  It took me a while to warm up to Marcello Giordani's initially wooden Des Grieux, but his portrayal gradually relaxed and took hold, imparting passion and depth to the role.  His beautiful singing is full of emotion, even if it is imperfect (whose isn't?).  I had high hopes for Karita Mattila as Manon, and she does not disappoint me.  I have no trouble believing this is a teenager who cannot manage beauty, love, wealth and an untimely death.  Granted, not every note Mattila produces during this performance is beautiful, but that is not necessary to be effective and compelling in verismo opera.  Like most of Puccini's heroines, this is a treacherous role, but Mattila handles it well and her singing is lovely when it needs to be, which is most of the time.  Her characterization is what I find the most impressive.  Levine in the pit is thoroughly absorbed in the gorgeous music, and he clearly loves every note Puccini wrote, bringing to life all the suffering, sorrow, and remorse that fill the score.  My favorite moment: the soaring duet in Act IV where Des Grieux, Manon, and the orchestra reach a most thrilling, devastating climax.

All of these recordings of the Met HD broadcasts offer so much more than just an audience seat at the opera house.  True genius has practically created another art form out of the genre, with everything from a birds-eye to a fly-on-the-wall view of everything going on, before, during, in-between, and after the four acts, both on and off stage.  We follow Maestro Levine to the pit and the singers on and off stage, and hear insightful and entertaining interviews given by the esteemed Renee Fleming (maybe the beloved soprano could have another career in broadcast journalism?).  We also learn in this production about how animals are trained to be creatures of the theatre and get glimpses of the detailed work that goes on when the curtain is down.

Taken as a whole package, this DVD production of one of my favorite operas is a welcome addition to my collection, one that I will surely return to again and again.",1226275200,10,2602,4.7959641255605385
3529669,3,B001DHE9KQ,"Puccini's beloved MANON LESCAUT is generally given a lace-valentine, sentimental production; here, the production team at Chemnitz substitutes a whole new set of opera cliches with their present mounting, to fairly tedious effect.  There's a basic romanticism to this luscious material that the drabbest production can't completely kill, but director Ansgar Weigner certainly gives it the old college try.  (Actually, I may be maligning him unfairly; there's a ""conception"" credit, whatever that might be, for one Dietrich Hilsdorf, who had the good sense to depart Chemnitz for happier climes somewhere along the way.  There's a series of supplementary interviews on this dvd with personnel chiming in about this situation, and expounding on their various brilliant ideas; frankly, I wasn't impressed enough with the work on display to sit through any of them.)  The singers are competent, if somewhat charmless.  Astrid Weber acquits herself well-enough vocally, but looks lacquered and hard (what's with that soggy-potato-chip wig someone's thrust upon her?), and lacks the necessary girlish naivete; she's pragmatic from the git-go, which takes the edge off the final act.  Speaking of which -- whose bright idea was it to present Puccini with a huggermugger escape for Manon and Des Grieux at the third act curtain?  This confusing scuffle leads to the production's biggest groaner; the lovers don't make it to Louisiana, heading instead for their date with destiny deep inside a Paris sewer.  Or subway platform.  Or whatever -- some subterranean hellhole we've seen three dozen times before.  The set's such a cliche, the viewer expects Jean Valjean or Patrice Chereau's Lulu to wander by.  And -- hello???? If they're beneath the Parisian streets, what's to stop Des Grieux from fetching a couple of croque monsieurs and a nice, unassertive red to revive his inamorata?  The costumes are the usual thrift-shop muddle (impossible to tell if we're in the 40's, 50's, or 60's; perhaps Manon's ankle straps are a clue); the conductor and orchestra emerge unscathed; and, in general, this opera's better served when Gerente looks older than either Manon or Des Grieux, which is not the case here.  Nothing about this production's truly terrible, but nothing's special, either.  Puccini completists only.  For the rest of us, it's deja vu all over again.",1225411200,12,2356,5.295698924731183
3529670,4,B001DHE9KQ,"When I first started watching this DVD, I became very apprehensive.  The two stars are among my favorite performers, yet unpleasant sounds often came out of their mouths and their acting left much to be desired.  But in the third and (particularly) fourth acts, both Karita Mattila and Marcello Giordani were singing and acting beautifully.  I think it just must have taken them some time on that day to settle into their performances.  Both were producing some exquisite singing and very convincing acting.  Ms. Mattila's performance of ""Sola, perduta, abbandonata"" was perhaps the best I have ever heard or seen.  She sang with tremendous musicality and intense emotion, but the performance was not overheated and never did she sacrifice beautiful tone for dramatic effect.

Of course, close-ups filmed in HD will do nothing to hide the facts that opera singers are typically old enough to be the parents of the characters they portray and must sing and must act in a way that will, in fact, reach the Family Circle, but watching the DVD is nevertheless a moving and satisfying substitute for seeing the performance live -- particularly when the principals (including the ever-reliable Dwayne Croft as Lescaut) are as good as they are here.",1222041600,11,1242,5.029268292682927

8293246,2,B001DHE9KQ,"A 5-star reviewer admits Karita Matilla is too old for the part and then shrugs and says, So what? The male lead is too old as well, so forget it.  Such may not matter in Aida or Turandot, but these are fatal flaws in a dvd production of Manon.  Alighting from the coach in Act 1, she looked for all the world like a maiden aunt chaperone and I kept searching for Manon.  It took me a while to catch on and no wonder.  Karita Matilla is 32 years older than (three times the age of!) the alluring 16 year old she is supposed to play.

Another 5-star reviewer is downright dazzled and writes, ""I have no trouble believing [Karita Matilla] is a teenager. . . . ""  This assertion astounds me! At 48, she is cruelly miscast for a young DVD role. Her game mannerisms and gestures only emphasize how securely she belongs in an older generation. The younger she tries to be, the more pathetic the result --- as when we see her,  almost 50, coquettishly bouncing on the bed in Act Two!  Matilla was cruelly treated by this assignment.  It's not her fault she ends up closer to Gloria Swanson in SUNSET BOULEVARD than Manon.

Marcello (""Stand & Deliver"") Giordani as Des Grieux is also 25 years too old for the part and reenforces the middle aged hue that's cast on the stage, despite the lovely, period stage sets that, unlike the casting of the two leads, are true to the story.

In many cases, I'm for kindness, gallantry and Look For The Silver Lining, but this production is too far out.",1335830400,5,1482,4.352727272727273
8293247,5,B001DHE9KQ,"For the most part this performance is smoking hot.  You couldn't ask for a better cast vocally. Karita Mattila has everything you want for this role.  I was afraid her Scandanavian timbre wouldn't mesh with Puccini but she's making a big healthy sound here and shows excellent attention to all the dynamic markings in the role.  Giordani is almost a completely different singer here from the one I've seen in other broadcasts.  He's so engaged and it's apparent he enjoys the role and working with Mattila.  They play with and off each other beautifully all the way through and his Act III outburst to the captain of the prison ship is very good.  He's the best thing we've got now as Domingo slowly fades away.

Dwayne Croft is excellent as Lescaut with just the right sneer in his tone and leer in the eye.  The rest of the supporting cast and chorus are spot on at every entrance and really seem to be enjoying themselves.

My biggest caveat is with the production which, is almost as old as I am. I'm an enormous fan of the designer Desmond Heeley and I think he's done some stunning work in the theater. This production needs a new paint job for starters and a serious re-think on the color scheme for the Paris boudior in Act II. It looks like green mold growing on glass. The first act and the last two acts are nearly perfect. The forced perspective on the Port of Le Harve is a knockout. You actually see them setting up the Act IV set and it's economy is pretty brilliant.  I have a feeling this is it's last outing.

James Levine obviously enjoys this opera and he whips the Met Orchestra into a frenzy.  Seriously some of the most beautiful playing I've ever heard on any recorded performance.  Lescaut is early Puccini and it's written in a slightly disjointed way that ensures that the players and conductor have to stay intensely alert and you can hear it.  The fine attention to detail, the speed and precision of articulation and the overwhelming warmth that this orchestra gives over and over. They are the real stars of this production.

Also Auntie Renee does the backstage color commentary and there's an amazing interview with the animal wranglers at the Met with some very surprising information on behavior of the horses.

Pay no attention to the crusty old grandad who gave this a single star and complained about the age of the singers and then made the preposterous recommendation of the Covent Garden with Te Kanawa !  'Cause what you don't need in Manon is a sleepwalker who can't get her pulse above 40.  The original telecast from this production back in the day is still very good even if there are a lot of technical problems with the cameras but, this is the Lescaut to own if your a fan of this work or anyone involved here.",1311465600,4,2759,4.539393939393939
8293248,4,B001DHE9KQ,"This is the most original production of one of Puccini's best and certainly most complex for singing operas.  It is a total opposite of another fabulous production of Manon Lescaut by The Flemish Opera conducted by Silvio Varviso, with Miriam Gauci in the title role and Antonio Ordonez as des Grieux.  If The Flemish Opera made a Cinderella story, this one is ... Verdi's Traviata?  Berg's Lulu? It is absolutely a fresh way to interpret this work like way, and to me very viable - Manon here is a beautiful, highly valued courtesan, and it is actually strange that it was not staged like Traviata or Lulu before.

The opera opens in some dusty provincial country tavern; in fact, anyone who has ever been to Amiens would smile to the verisimilitude of this dcor to the actual heavy provincial atmosphere of that town.  The timeline is probably around early 1930s - the movie ""Cabaret"" comes to mind.  We see cynical, vulgar, tawdry crude crowd;  the ugliness of these people is stressed by deliberately made repulsive local sex professionals.  The spirit is of an angry impoverished crowd of petit bourgeoisie before WWII.

Amidst all the swinery suddenly Manon appears, incredibly elegant and powerfully captivating.  Here one wonders if she is femme fatale, a  Lulu.  Her appearance is accompanied by thundering and ominous music.  Puccini's genius at affecting emotions with his unique talent is here at full force already.

The singers are very good, but they are far from Mirella Freni and Placido Domingo ; yet this production makes them shine.  Astrid Weber is expertly in both singing and acting; she plays an experienced courtesan.  In her dialog with des Grieux ""Vedete, Io son fedele"" she is becoming a Violetta, mocking des Grieux  (Alfredo) innocence and sincerity.  This scene in this production is alluding unmistakably to ""Sempre libera"", almost if this Manon would sing Violetta's part ""Oh! Oh! Amore! Follie! Gioir!"".  Very witty and interesting!

Zurab Zurabishvili as des Grieux is an excellent companion to Astrid Weber.  He sings with expertise and acts well; his appearance is very suitable for the role of a young romantic lover.  I like him better than Jose Cura, but he is not Domingo and he struggles with high notes and demands of his role sometimes.

There are many gems in this production.  I find it a great idea that Geronte is also a young man;  here Manon's valuing her position of wealth and comfort with Geronte is made the most clear; in fact, the whole quarrel with Geronte seems like an fatal accident that she comes to regret immediately, but must stick with des Grieux now.  The scene with Geronte's retinue also depicts so well the decadence of the time.

The last scene in the Fourth Act is assigned much importance by the director Ansgar Weigner, who gives an extensive interview, explaining that at the end des Grieux does not even try to find water for Manon, since she has been destroying him and he lost his love for her.  I profoundly disagree with the director on this interpretation.  It seems as Ansgar Weigner never bothered to read the actual book ""L'Histoire du chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut"" by Abbe Prevost (1731); otherwise it is not clear how he could have arrived at such conclusion.  One can already see from the original title that des Grieux takes the first position in the story;  Manon is an episode in his life, however significant.

The libretto, which is closely derived from the book, makes it apparent that it was des Grieux who ruined Manon; all the troubles could have been avoided first if des Grieux had just married Manon at once after the elopement.  But the author (Abbe Prevost) makes a vague excuse that ""before"" there wasn't enough time and ""after"" it was no longer necessary.  Of course, if they got married, we would not have the story.  But since the director attempts to interpret it, he should contemplate more; then it becomes clear that perhaps the original Manon loved des Grieux initially, but for whatever reason she was happy to leave him - obviously he could never give her what she wanted.  Most likely, it was sexual; it could be wealth as well, but - the point is that it was Manon who was always fleeing des Grieux and he would chase her, tearing her away from her rich keepers,  persuading her into his designs of robbery and theft of her patrons.  However, she was happy to be a mistress of rich men; yet, as the first lover, des Grieux exerted powerful influence on her, and she was weak enough not to resist his constant ruinous proposals, which eventually led to her demise.

Even in the famous scene ""Tu, tu, amore?""  it is des Grieux who comes to Manon, not vice versa.  Why then such a  strange idea that Manon destroyed des Grieux?  The young nobleman could not reconcile his pride and ego with her desertion of him; and at the end, she dies but he lives!  But apparently this simple fact is not enough for this director's logic.  And accordingly, Traviata died while Alfredo lived, and so perished Lulu.  Perhaps a better idea would be to say that des Grieux realizes with Manon that he was a failure in the world of men, and  as a consequence he becomes a self-loathing loser, full of self-pity simultaneously, hating the woman he victimized and himself.

Thus I think it is obvious that des Grieux could not accept the idea of being rejected by this woman;  it was obsession, not love.  des Grieux is too full of cruelty and selfishness for love.  Yet the director is probably full of self-loathing and self-pity himself; I always suspect that these directors fit something very personal into such amazing conclusions; maybe in this case it is also German misogyny reminiscent of Puccini's era  - Freud, Franz von Stuck, etc.

In any case, I still find the bonus track very interesting, with the interviews of  the conductor Frank Beermann, the director Ansgar Weigner and others, although I disagree with many psychological conclusions they made for Manon Lescaut, and I think Weigner completely misunderstood the characters of both Manon and des Grieux.  Some points are simply ridiculous - WHY must Manon grow up? She probably wants to stay a pretty carefree girl, a woman of pleasure, leaving by pleasure, like Handel's Semele...  She is not Ariadne, not Medea - why can't a woman be what she wants to be, even if it is Traviata?  This director just can't accept the idea of a woman free in her will, doing what she wants, just as des Grieux could not,  as it is actually des Grieux who could never grow up and remained a selfish cruel boy.

All in all, the singing is competent to the end, but I feel Astrid Weber simply did  not have enough voice to make ""Sola, perduta, abbandonata"" freeze the blood in your veins.

It is also so incredibly surprising to read negative reviews of this comparatively modern opera, depicting people with shaky morals - a woman for sale and a fallen noble who lives by gambling and fraud.  To me, this production was quite believable - they are all young and attractive, and one can see reckless passions at work at self-destruction.  It is much more difficult to believe in many other productions, dull and perpetuating the same stale idea, with overweight aged past their prime prima donna(s) and primo uomo(s),  passing vulgarity for youth in their interpretation, as with Karita Mattila at the Met.  Plus, thinking of how sublime noble pompous Handel's operas are staged now in extremely controversial productions, it is hard to see such disapproval of this one - after all, this is not a love story, but rather a story of male selfishness, inferiority complex and misogyny, as des Grieux so splendidly demonstrates.  He methodically destroys Manon until her total perdition.  Thus it is really a harsh story, and not a sentimental sugary syrup that many seem to expect.  It is somewhat ironic to see innovative approaches being lauded with Handel and conservatism taking victory with Puccini's Manon! - as if Poppea is preferred to be seen as a harlot while Manon as a chaste princess.

Singing-wise, the best for me has so far been a recording of Mirella Freni with Placido Domingo, with the direction of Sinopoli.  That comparative production was quite traditional.  Since then it is interesting to see and hear new interpretations, and this is a very fresh and innovative;  I recommend it to those interested in Puccini and verismo music.

The singers are very good, but they are far from Mirella Freni and Placido Domingo ; yet this production makes them shine.

8293249,1,B001DHE9KQ,"With this performance, and the DVD, the Met has taken a new step towards its reputation as the most atrocious opera house among the rich and famous.

It seems that for the roles of young lovers in this performance anyone younger than 50 was disqualified. That would be somewhat excusable if the protagonists sang well, but both Karita Mattila and Marcello Giordani were frightening in their squeaky voices and obvious strain with parts they performed.  Indeed once again Met seemed to excel to engage the fading stars, it seems, rolling on big names who can't sing anymore - and it is especially awful that this DVD is only from 2008, so quite new.

Not only their singing leaves cold and rather shivering from displeasure, the acting in the Madrigal and Dance scenes is just so vulgar and low-taste; how can believe that Manon is a young and beautiful gentle lover, when this older woman behaves like a fish seller at the peasant market?  The whole production impresses with crudity and lack of any tenderness;  the singers were a caricature on their roles, and perhaps they would resemble bored libertines from Les Liaisons Dangereuses if they acted with more elegance. The production also lacks any imagination as it was done in the old traditional style, yet one can hardly imagine these people as refined French - but rather as American trailer park dwellers in disguise.

In addition, the inserts with Renee Fleming also impressed with a TV soap opera style comments, which intruded in the fabric of the work - these should have been left to bonus materials, but not interwoven into the performance itself.

This DVD is a huge failure - both as an opera performance and as a DVD production.  One could compare this with an earlier Flemish Opera production with Miriam Gauci and Jan Danckaert or with Covent Garden one with Placido Domingo and Kiri Te Kanawa for an evening of enjoyment.",1262217600,12,1892,4.817901234567901
8293250,3,B001DHE9KQ,"I love Puccini's music in this opera--what he writes for the voices and for the orchestra.  I'm also a big fan of the Met's video productions of their many operas; not just the ones done recently in high definition, but those done on video tape since the 1980s at least.  They are well-directed;  thank you, Brian Large, director of this one.
Overall, I enjoyed Karita Mattila in this production; I thought her acting was absolutely right for what is, after all, a stage production (not a film).  Her voice isn't perfect at every moment, but she won me over.
I find tenor Marcello Giordani uneven, based on a couple of performances I've attended and when I've heard him on the radio, and in this video;  I mean this re: his voice and his acting.  I find it a bit painful to watch and listen to him.  I agree with another reviewer, though, that he is better in the final acts than in the first two.",1250553600,3,897,4.4
8293251,1,B001DHE9KQ,"Ditto the two reviewers above. I just this moment finished viewing this mess, and though I am still reeling from the beauty of the music, I cannot forgive the production. The first act ensemble staging antics were embarrassing to watch. The second act was a jumbled mess. What was with the intoxicated singer in male drag? The third act was almost passable until the final moments when Manon became a murderess at the last moment!! And the last act was so flawed I don't even want to open that can of worms or I'll be here writing all night, and I have much better things to do. One other thing, I think our other two reviewers were much to kind as to the singing abilities of Des Grieux. His ""money"" notes for me were actually painful. They were unsupported and almost shouted. I still have a bit of a sore throat after hearing them.

I don't mean to be mean spirited - but, come on!! This, to me, is Puccini's masterpiece. To see it so boldly desecrated infuriates me.",1236988800,4,970,4.418994413407821
