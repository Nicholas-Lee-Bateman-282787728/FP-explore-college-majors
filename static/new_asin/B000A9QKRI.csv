2380199,5,B000A9QKRI,"I call it a postmodern sitcom.  It definitely has taken sitcoms to the next level.  It's so simple, yet so complex.  I adore this show so much.  It is clever, brilliant, and hilarious.  I loved the first season, was terrified that it was going to get cancelled, and then when it got renewed I was terrified that it was going to go completely downhill.  I never would've thought it possible, but the second season was even more brilliant and funny.  And when I found out it was renewed for a third season, I breathed a sigh of relief.  Everyone should watch this show.",1121731200,7,567,4.436893203883495
2380200,5,B000A9QKRI,"The fact that I'm this excited about writing a review for something that doesn't even come out for another 3 months should tell you two things.  One, that I really need to get out more.  Two, ""Arrested Development"" is the finest television being produced right now.  Try to focus on that second one, and get this show.  You won't regret it.  Can't wait for season 3!

ps-This is out now, and worth every penny.  Absolutely brilliant show.  And it may be hard to imagine, but things get even better when you can watch 5 or 6 episodes at a time.  Hooray DVD!",1121731200,7,556,4.372549019607843

This will be a must have come October, and will be a great companion to the new episodes of Season Three come this fall. Huzzah!",1121299200,6,333,4.6440677966101696

Each time it's like a Cracker Jack box, theirs a new surprise, you didn't get the first time.  The only disappointment was Season 4, which seemed forced and contrived, due to the fact he wasn't able to gather the cast together at the same time,hence, it seem fragmented.

I watched all 3 seasons so far on here, and also read the 'trivia' for this show on IMDb in general and for each episode and realized the gags are so much deeper than I ever realized. Finally, a comedic show for the intelligent, and it gets cut from tv. Go figure.

The absurdity of the storylines pale in comparison to the front page of any newspaper... thus it's closer to reality than most would like to admit.  I admit it's not a show for everyone, and for those there are a myriad of alternates to consume. So... move along... move along...",1411084800,,617,4.3304347826086955

Michael Bluth continues to attempt to keep his family together while facing many other problems including a blind lawyer and a loose seal. If you enjoyed the first season, you will surely love this one. On the other hand, though, I also found that the witty humor can sometimes get tiresome; I therefore like to balance the show with other, more simple, primitive media that use mostly raunchy humor.

They really push the limits on absurdity!  But not in the purely absurd way that Monty Python did (which not everyone likes I realize) - they push it to absurd within a nomn-absurd setting, meaning, the dysfunctional family is normal and common-place.  But they push it to the absurd level and beyond.  Absoultely great.  You'll love season two and won't be able to stop....",1400112000,,561,4.683673469387755

2381131,5,B000A9QKRI,"This is truly one of the best comedy shows ever. I've been a fan of Seinfeld, The Office, 30 Rock, Modern Family, etc, but this one tops it. I only hope that you put more seasons out on Prime. We are already into watching Season 3. I can't get enough. For comedy lovers out there - this is a must see!! Tons of stars as the main characters and tons more stars make appearances. This is my favorite!! Keep them coming!!",1391990400,,418,4.172839506172839
2381132,5,B000A9QKRI,"Arrested Development Season 2  is even better than the first one. From hilarious blind lawyer played by Seinfeld's Julia Louis Dreyfus to Tabias auditioning for blue mans group second season leaves no one without a laughter.
Absolutely amazing",1391731200,,243,5.394736842105263
2381133,5,B000A9QKRI,Missed it the first time around; glad I found it on Prime.  Must watch comedy if you enjoy satire or frankly just need a good laugh.  No current TV sitcom can compare.,1391731200,,167,4.1875
2381153,5,B000A9QKRI,"I wasn't sure if the writers could maintain the comedy hilarity from Season 1, but they have.  Season 2 continues on with great characters, creative story lines, and big laughs.  I look forward to season 3.",1391558400,,206,4.694444444444445

2381156,5,B000A9QKRI,"Couldn't recommend more highly ! Seems a classic to me, the entire series; marvelous cast, mercurial wit, & relentless comedy. Preposterous characters in zany, yet cohesive story, infectiously funny..what a ball the cast & crew must have had in production",1391040000,,255,5.4
2381157,4,B000A9QKRI,I was unable to watch AD when it was on TV before.  So I really enjoy watching it now--when I have the time and no commericals..  Roku and Amazon Prime are the best!!!,1390953600,,167,4.03030303030303
2381158,5,B000A9QKRI,"I watched most of the series when it originally aired, it was really fun to cruise through the entire season in a couple weeks. I love the off the wall humor and laughing when I think something is funny (instead of when the laugh track producers usually use to let us know what's supposed to garner a laugh). The cast is all-star, Will Arnett is one of my favorite sitcom actors and of course Jason Bateman and Michael Sierra are great well know actors as well.",1390867200,,461,4.372093023255814

Thanks Amazon Prime for introducing me to this show.",1390867200,,128,4.16
2381160,5,B000A9QKRI,Because this is one of the best shows to grace television though sadly it was not as appreciated as it should've been. Likely reasons are the majority of America are morons who can't pick up the smart or subtle humor.,1390867200,,217,4.45
2381161,5,B000A9QKRI,"BRILLIANT comedy. But hey, Fox cancels everything decent, right? Too bad even as an Amazon Prime Member you've got to go to Netflix for the new episodes, which were thankfully (and absolutely justifiably) picked up.",1390780800,,215,5.171428571428572

2381184,5,B000A9QKRI,"So brilliant. Every scene has three or four things going on around the key action that are hilarious in themselves; in fact the running gags continue from scene to scene, episode to episode, and season to season. So if you've only seen one episode, you're missing out on half the humor. The only show that will make you want to drive a stair car. The cast is packed with  phenomenal comedians. This is a one-of-a-kind treat in American TV.",1389225600,,439,4.556962025316456

2381188,5,B000A9QKRI,"I thought the first season of Arrested Development was a winner.  Didn't know how the producers would duplicate it.  But they did!

2381210,5,B000A9QKRI,"Gives a whole new meaning to dysfunctional family!!!  All the actors are great in their respective parts and play so well off each other.

2381250,4,B000A9QKRI,Even better than the first season.  Chronicling the tales of the Bluth family while having tons of side story's with each character make it a great season to watch.,1384992000,,164,4.655172413793103

2381255,5,B000A9QKRI,"Goofy, goofy,  goofy and delightful.!  Far out and whoever has the imagination to write something as imaginative as this has a genius screw loose.  It reminds me of the utterly impossible and yet amusing but perhaps possible work of Carl Haasen.  If you are a serious person you'll think this is nonsense,  but if you have an uncontollable sense of humor, this is for you.!  The more I looked,  the more I got addicted.  Zany would be a description !",1383696000,,450,4.5375

2381294,5,B000A9QKRI,"This is definitely a series that you must watch and pay attention to from the first episode of the first season. The second season dives into the deeper depths of outlandish scenarios and characters, but might leave you scratching your head if you don't understand the inside jokes that were developed throughout season one.
The humor is smart, dry, dark, and punny at times (Lucille, Loose Seal) and never fails to spark laughter. The comedy is balanced with moments of sincerity that explore human nature, family, and life lessons in a way that anyone can relate to. This is a continuation a a masterfully executed series that will leave you wanting more.",1382659200,,657,4.875
2381295,5,B000A9QKRI,"I love watching this series but this one episode has to be one of the funniest ones.

2381549,5,B000A9QKRI,"This is really edgy comedy for intelligent people with mainstream values. Most of the characters are extreme versions of someone you know. But the writers don't take it so far where it's not funny. Also, the characters are very self-centered but somehow, the writers keep enough warmth and soul in the family where you're not turned off. You like them, but you still laugh at their extreme antics. You must watch from the beginning or you'll miss a lot of the humor and inside jokes. Enjoy!",1375056000,,490,4.709302325581396

2381639,5,B000A9QKRI,"My kids turned me on to this...specifically my daughter.  One of these ""friend told a friend"" things.  The Bluth family, which is the subject of this series, is at the same time the funniest and most dysfunctional family ever grace the airwaves. The show lampoons a lot of different things, the humor is sometimes silly and broad, other times so intelligent you almost miss it (and that's sometimes the funniest of all)
Although you could start anywhere in the series, I would urge you to start with  Season 1, Episode 1, and work your way through.  My daughter and I started with Episode 1 at the start of her summer break (she's in college).  We watch it sporadically,, as we're both pretty busy. But, when we do sit down to watch it, we watch about 3 episodes at a time...and that seems about right.  I can only take so much funny at a time!  Sadly, we're already 1/2 way through the 3rd season...which will be all we can watch, unless we spring for a subscription to a competing service that sponsored a 4th ""revival"" season just recently.  We enjoy it so much, we might just have to break down and do it.
If you enjoy intelligent, clever, laugh out loud lampoonery, you should sample a little Arrested Development....but be careful!  You'll probably end up hooked!",1371945600,,1269,4.604444444444445
2381640,5,B000A9QKRI,"Arrested Development is in a league of its own as far as comedy goes. I love how the characters stay true and take themselves seriously, which makes everything outrageously impossibly engaging and entertaining. I am addicted.",1371945600,,225,5.277777777777778

2381644,5,B000A9QKRI,"I began watching Arrested Development when it first started airing. I bought the DVD sets when they first came out. I always recommended the show to friends and new people everywhere I went. I let friends borrow it and at some point I let someone borrow the second season and by the time I needed it again I couldn't recall who had it. It took a long time, but I finally got around to buying the second season. It's still as great as I remember! I'd recommend everyone purchase AD for their DVD collection.",1371772800,,506,4.3936170212765955

2381680,5,B000A9QKRI,"Unique, imaginative writing. Acting a constant delight. Layers of humor and meaning as well. Insightful. Hours of enjoyment. Unforgettable moments. Great escape. Worthwhile and delightful -- edgy and risky. Not politically correct.  Streamed a comedy odyssey so far 2013 -- began with ""The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret"" on a whim (David Cross & Will Arnett). Hilarious, physical comedy, witty.  Blake Harrison great in ""...Decision"" so led to ""Inbetweeners"" which is amusing but limited.  Along the way sidetracked to ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" which is tops for physical humor, over-the-top approach, themes and acting.  All around Arrested Development is THE series. Surprising, hilarious and entertaining.",1370995200,,733,5.822429906542056

2381758,5,B000A9QKRI,This season is my favorite mainly because Tobias is blue.  I also like the move away from prison towards the more appropriate comedic setting of suburbia.,1369785600,,154,4.923076923076923

2381795,5,B000A9QKRI,For anybody who like subtle humor. This series does not follow the common patterns of comedy. This contains dark humor and jokes that usually would not be on TV. But it is done in a way that is not so obvious making it a puzzle and entertainment at the same time.,1368662400,,263,4.176470588235294

2381838,5,B000A9QKRI,This is a hilarious show that should have continued. You have to watch from the beginning to get to know the characters and their quirky lives. I'm now part of the cult. Definitely worth watching again from the start,1368576000,,216,4.564102564102564
2381839,5,B000A9QKRI,Surprisingly caught several running jokes that I missed the first two times around. This is a heavily layered comedy that is best watched repeatedly. I loved having Amazon Prime so I can go back and rerun my favorite shows.,1368489600,,223,4.743589743589744
2381840,1,B000A9QKRI,Not really my thing I didn't care for any of the actors and the humor was more repulsive than funny.,1368489600,,100,4.05

2381870,5,B000A9QKRI,"I watch ""Arrested Development"" once per year.  I am *still* picking up little bits and pieces that I hadn't noticed the first half-dozen times I've watched the series.  When it first aired on FOX back in 2004, I just knew that 99% of it would go over most people's heads.  I had the DVD's but gave them to a friend so they can experience the sheer brilliance of this show.  Often, second seasons (or movie sequels) bomb, but not Arrested Development!  The second season keeps right on rolling with the great, zany humor.  I simply can't gush enough about this series!  You will either connect with it or you won't.",1367712000,,614,4.527272727272727
2381871,5,B000A9QKRI,"If you don't already know why you should love Arrested Development, then I don't know what my review can do convince you, but here goes:

Arrested Development is one of the funniest TV shows of all time.  The cast are masters of a smart kind of deadpan humor that you don't see elsewhere.  The writing is tight, weaving several ongoing stories into a single episode that works on it's own, but is always building a much bigger plot.  The show is unapologetic smart, and not the forced smart you got with Frasier.  The smart on this show is knowing when to be high brow, when to be low brow, and even when to be no brow.  This is one of the shows that if you don't like it, we can't be friends, and I may have to slash your tires.",1367712000,,729,4.171428571428572
2381872,5,B000A9QKRI,What's not to love? The dialogue is witty and fast. The jokes are ridiculous and you find yourself repeating them to other AD lovers.,1367712000,,133,4.583333333333333

2381874,5,B000A9QKRI,I enjoyed every second of this show.  I watched every show from every season.  Great show to watch while recovering from surgery.,1367539200,,129,4.818181818181818
2381875,5,B000A9QKRI,"The whole series rocks. If you've never watched it, start at Season 1 Episode 1- its the only way many of the jokes in the rest of the series make sense. Great humor",1367452800,,165,4.03030303030303
2381876,5,B000A9QKRI,Holy moley. I love this show. This is just so funny. I resisted watching this for a long time and I don't know why- it's awesome.,1367366400,,129,4.0

2381896,4,B000A9QKRI,Still a highly entertaining show with a sitcom sensibility all its own and excellent acting. But the 2nd season seems to rely more on plot contrivances than story lines that feel like a natural outgrowth of the characters' actions. There's also less of the ongoing tension between the family members' innate selfishness and the affection they occasionally display toward each other.,1366416000,,382,5.278688524590164
2381917,5,B000A9QKRI,"Even after being off the air for almost seven years, Arrested Development still entertains. It's the thinking man's comedy. Good stuff.",1366156800,,135,5.476190476190476

2381921,4,B000A9QKRI,Season 2 is a continuation of short episodes in the life of a very dyfuntional family where all ot the children are grown and mainly live together. It is funny and non-thought provoking. good entertainment when you wish to relax,1365811200,,228,4.725
2381922,5,B000A9QKRI,We love arrested development and would highly recommend it to anyone. Great humor. Great casting. Overall just a well done show. Hoping another season comes out like we've heard rumors of that happening.,1365811200,,203,5.181818181818182

2381956,5,B000A9QKRI,"It is a relic of the past but it was too advanced for its day. The problem it wasn't a popular for its day (2003-2006) was because it had a style of writing that wouldn't succeed on a weekly basis. This show has to be watched from the beginning to get all the jokes and gags. They would set up a joke in one episode and it would pay off 3 weeks later or 3 episodes later. What is even better is to watch it in a couple of sittings.
I often find myself laughing every 2 minutes. This dysfunctional family has a way of making your day with their sometimes crude but funny jokes, crazy stunts, and sub-plots that would be resolved many episodes later. I do warn you that you have to watch the show from the beginning to get the overall concept and the running gags. You might also be able to catch all the easter eggs that are scattered about.",1364083200,,840,4.128048780487805

Everyone knows, of course, that the essential ingredients for successful TV sitcoms are in the writing, the cast, and the timing of the show's release.  Arrested Development no doubt met both the former criteria; the writing is so clever, so offbeat, and so layered with wonderfully bizarre motifs (chicken dance, Tobias' ambiguous sexuality, George Michael and Maeby's on-again-off-again flirtation) that it begs repeated viewings.  And the cast is absolutely stellar.  Each individual performer is spectacular, but it's the way they riff off of one another that truly creates the show's magic.  The only problem with the show, I suppose, was in its timing.  It was cancelled after only three seasons, which signifies that its handlers didn't know how to market it, or perhaps that most viewers are not interested in TV that requires steadfast attention.

So we are left with 50 or so episodes that are, more or less, representing some of the funniest and best TV moments in the last twenty or thirty years.

All three seasons STRONGLY recommended!",1334361600,,1303,5.075117370892019

I know that AD wasn't getting the viewership (according to the Nielsen Media Research Ratings) it needed to be financially successful, but I think that the Nielsen ratings are not accurate anymore; how many people do you know who watch shows online, either free or one's purchased? What about on their Droid's, IPhone's, IPad's, etc? Arrested Development is such a smart, witty, funny, extremely well-acted, before it's time/as it stands up well with what's going on today in the world, several years after it's been off the air. I just hope that the AD is made or that some channel gets all these actors back together and start where they left off--I bet the viewership would be millions more now, especially if the Nielsen group started calculating viewership correctly.

Not every joke works, but as it gets weirder and weirder (and funnier and funnier), all I could think is ""how

The Bluth family continues in its selfish demise, even after Michael makes an attempt to escape the family, but they do not notice.  Tobias attempts to join the Blue Man Group, while Maeby stumbles upon an after-school job as a movie producer.  George Michael continues to be awkward with Bland, I mean Ann, while Michael's desperate attempts to save the family and the company get side tracked once again for the ladies.  Buster attempts to make a bold move by joining the army.  More hilarity ensues in this season, too much to be contained here!

Guest stars include: Liza Minnelli, Martin Short, Ed Begley Jr., Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Ben Stiller, Zach Braff, and Christine Taylor.

2382154,4,B000A9QKRI,"""Arrested Development"" is one of the funniest and most inventive shows in history. While I adore everything about season one, season two had a couple of flat moments among the genius. I was particularly amused with the concept of Tobias joining Blue Man Group, and found the reappearance of George Senior and Kitty, and the appearance of Oscar (George Senior's brain-fried hippie brother) likewise hilarious. I also thought the treason angle with Saddam Hussein was cleverly handled, but I found the characterization of Christianity to be unnecessary and inaccurate, even for a satire. Likewise, I found the characterization of the military to be less than comedic gold, although I do think the undercurrent of wealthy American's sense of entitlement and condescension to the military to be generally accurate.

The acting is, once again, brilliant, and the scripts consistently deliver unpredictable and hilarious plot twists. I was extremely amused by the interactions of Gob (Will Arnett); and Buster (Tony Hale) which led to Buster's hand being bitten off by a seal, and the interactions between Lucille and Lucille Two to be wonderful. The presence of Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Maggie was also a strong point, as was the cameo by Dick Van Patten. By far the best of the guest appearances was by Ed Begley, Jr., who, thanks to alopecia gets to wear a hilarious assortment of wigs and fake eyebrows which detach at the most unseemly of times.

The DVD set has a variety of extras including deleted scenes, a blooper reel and several commentaries, which are, in some places, overtly hostile and condescending to conservatives (the ""Red State"" discussion is particularly revealing of the views of some of the cast members, notably David Cross.) The blooper reel is definitely rated R for language and is far coarser than the intelligence of the show would have you otherwise believe.

Overall I think ""Arrested Development"" is great, and should still be on the air. While this is not my favorite season, I still recommend this DVD set with the caveats that it is somewhat cruder and more politically inflammatory than the peerless first season.",1240358400,,2142,5.079545454545454

Season Two builds on jokes started in the first season, builds jokes that resolve in the third season, and delivers punchlines to jokes that haven't even been told yet - something that makes repeated viewing enjoyable and worthwhile.

The second season of Arrested Development starts off where the first ended. George Sr. has escaped, Michael is getting fed up, Tobias' sexuality isn't getting any clearer, etc. You know, the usual. I won't spoil what happens, so you'll just have to find out for yourself.

The extras for season two are about the same as for season one. There are just as many hilarious deleted scenes that you can tell were cut for time, not quality. There are another few goodies you'll find as well (including a Tobias easter egg).

2382196,5,B000A9QKRI,"As a fan of Get Smart while growing up, I learned to appreciate subtle wit and clever writing.  In a sea of reality television and endless cable channels, television has become diluted and a poor entertainment source over the years.  Arrested Development was such a pleasant surprise.  I accidentally came across it while fishing for a sporting event and was hooked within the first few seconds.  It was a bit where one familiy member mistakenly assumes the blueman group to be a therapy group for men who are feeling a little down.  In taking it to an obsessive level, Tobias makes himself feel better by painiting himself blue.  The random blue stains left behind and awkward interactions will make your stomach muscles get a workout.

The casting is brilliant and the comedy is nonstop.  It is a mixture of intelligent, sardonic wit and sight gags.  It's a show that each time you watch an episode again, you discover something new to laugh at.  It's obvious that the writers loved working on this project.  All of the seasons are wonderful.  Be warned though, once you start watching, it is REALLY hard not to advanced to the next episode.  It's addictive!

2382201,5,B000A9QKRI,"Hands down I am so impressed with this program.  I hate to come right out and begin by giving praise to a particular series without a proper introduction, but with Arrested Development the excitement just bubbles over the top.  To begin, the first season was above the word phenomenal.  There was something unique, original, and compellingly humorous about the cast, the concept, and every small detail surrounding the show.  Now, with the second season behind me, there is nothing more to say than simply, ""Bravo"".  With any second season you have your worries, will the studio give more money ... will those characters we love return again ... or will the humor falter for a more visually stimulating program?  As any repeat viewer sits down for the second season, these compelling thoughts will race through your mind, but I am here to assure you, Arrested Development, remains (even today - well after it has been released from FOX) the best situational comedy this decade.  I would even have the gumption to say that it rivals that of Seinfeld with its bold, dark humor and strangely compelling cast.  The envelope was pushed hard with the second season, and I must admit that I am excited to go back and revisit it anytime.  Sure, I know what will happen in each episode and the eventual outcome of our cast, but their emotion, their realism, their (dare to be repetitive) comic timing was AMAZING.  Every single aspect of this program, from first season to this season was nothing short of perfection.  I have never seen a program work this well on so many different levels.

This review will sound a bit like my original review for the first season, but it is only because I cannot stop myself from praising the little feet this show walked on.  As always, it was dropped well before its time, but thankfully we had the opportunity to see developing characters like Tobias and Lindsay work together their marriage, Gob work through his ""unsealed"" marriage, Michael try to continue to save the company and his family, and Buster deal with going into Army and his loss of powerful appendage.  These few key phrases only begin to scratch the surface of this show, surprisingly the producers went deeper and created a larger Arrested Development universe that did not fail or rock the foundation of that model home.  Gob's marriage situation was hysterical because it actually dealt with his real-life wife Amy Poehler, while Buster kept me in stitches trying to overcome his obsessive mother.  At first I was hesitant with Michael's relationship with Julia-Louis Dryfuss, but by the end, it worked for me.  She was a perfect counterpart to the lifestyle that Michael boasts.  Tobias' use of language in this series demonstrated the sheer brilliance of this show, and everyone else just fell into place.  Kinda like kissing cousins ... right?  I know I am failing miserably at really gauging the power of this show, but one could talk for hours about the genuine crispness of this program and again, never quite scratch the surface.  All one needs to know when reading this review is that this is what perfection feels like.  This is what happens when you combine clich characters, in over-the-top situations, with a strong cast, and phenomenal writing.  For those of us watching this on FOX, we knew we were witnessing a cult classic in the making.

Overall, I cannot speak more highly of this show.  I give this series out to friends and family as random gifts, I speak about this show anywhere I go (even if the conversation isn't headed in that direction), and I would happily sign my name on any sheet asking for a revival.  FOX, again, dropped the ball on what could have been a hysterical series that lasted for a very long time.  Could another station pick this up, sure, it would continue to bring in ratings and reach even more fans.  I could wake up in the morning listening to Gob's magic (or is it illusion?) music as he continues to inspire me to work harder every day (it actually more enjoyable to do things without getting punched in the gut).  I would love to walk next to Tobias every day with his eagerness to please his family and wife, while enjoying daily breakfast made by Mrs. Featherbottom.  I would be friends with George Michael, listening to his stories about Maeby and his girlfriend ... what is her name ... strange ... I can't seem to remember and I have seen this series four times?  Odd.  I would love to live in the Bluth condo, hang out with Buster's brother Anyan, and question the relationship between Buster and Uncle Oscar.  There were just so many memorable moments in this series that I could go on like this forever.  There are lines that I still quote from this series around friends and myself whenever I need a laugh.  I was continually impressed with the pop culture references (who didn't like the Peanuts, head down with piano music, moments) as well as current events.  George Sr's Iraq connection ...

I cannot, and now will not, speak any further of this show on this review.  I believe you know my stance on this program and that no matter what anyone would say I will stand by it.  It is the BEST (next to Firefly) that I have ever seen on television and will continue to curse those on FOX who dropped it.  I will suggest to everyone reading this to go and buy this IMMEDIATELY because no matter the price, you will enjoy every last drop of it.  Go now friends, you have Arrested Development or Girls with Low Self-Esteem to watch. (either one will be worth a great laugh!)

2382202,4,B000A9QKRI,"I could write one line to decribe this show. Hilarious. However I love this show so much that I'm gonna write more. I highly recommend watching season 1 before this, as many of the jokes carry over to this season (one of the many reasons I love this show).

As I said you should watch season 1 before this, so I'm not gonna go into explanation about the shows storyline, instead outline some of the incredibly funny moments. There was an awful lot to choose from, but the funniest for me was Buster using Gob's puppet exclaiming to his mother ""I don't want to go to no country club you freak BITCH!"", or Maebe's job and catchphrase ""Marry me"" and then switching it up in a priceless moment ""BABYSIT ME!"". The season long gag of nobody remembering Ann, George Michaels girlfriend, was great as well.

The cast is wonderful. Each character has so much depth its amazing. The show as a whole is near perfect because of everyone. I think if one was missing the show would lose impact because all the jokes bounce off of each character. I found myself loving Maebe's storyline, as well as her as an actor. Incredibly funny along with George Michael. Buster is my favorite though. He plays a potentially annoying character very well and hilariously.

I cant give this as high a rating as season 1, because I felt that was better, but this one is no disappointment. The only critique I have is some storylines seemed to not wrap up. That may be due to the season being cut down a few episodes. Either way you'll laugh, a lot, in this wonderful season to a wonderful show.",1171670400,2,1564,4.480701754385965

2382216,5,B000A9QKRI,"It's impossible for me to pick a favorite season of this show.  Every episode in the series is so well crafted and stylized that they are able to continue building upon old jokes throughout the whole season.  It's incredible how many jokes this show can fit into  such a short amount of time, that it makes the rewatch value that much better.

This season features some of my favorite storylines, as well as some of the best guest stars.  Christine Taylor, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Liza Minnelli, Ed Begley Jr., Ben Stiller (who I usually find annoying but is great as Tony Wonder), Zach Braff, and Martin Short all make appearances this season and Henry Winkler returns as the family's lawyer Barry Zuckerkorn.

Michael continues to try and keep the family business from falling apart while his fugitive father hides in the attic of the model home the family resides in.  Tobias continues to pursue acting this season, and continues to be one of the best characters in the show.  Between the blue man group, ""scandel makers"", and Mrs. Featherbottom, the writers always give him something entertaining to do.  This is the season where Maybe begins her double life as a movie producer which makes her character that much more interesting, while George Michael struggle between his feelings for his cousin and his religious girlfriend Bland... I mean Anne.  Buster joins the army and loses an appendage.

There's far too much to tell, you just have to watch it to understand what you're missing.  Start with the first season if you haven't seen it already and then continue on with this.  The quality never diminishes.  This is by far one of the best original, ensemble sitcoms to come along in a long time and should not be overlooked.",1168732800,2,1730,4.800675675675675

Like showtime's Dead Like Me, the narrated shows delivered us something that we have enough of in our lives but can always stand to watch more of. Chaos. If that isn't enough the cast acted out their shallow characters as well as possible, only offending people half of the time. Despite that it put a face on corporations and showed that everyone even crooks are human. I own every season and pride my self on recently reviewing each delightfully hilarious episode and finding each episode better than the next.

Season two produced some amazing comedy, and jokes I still laugh about to this day with friends.  Such as Tobias' infamous line ""I just blue myself"", Buster's ""Unlimited Juice!?"" comments, and many others.  This show will likely remain one of my favorite comedies for many years to come.

There's not much to say that's not already been said. The special features are so-so, but that's not the only reason to buy a DVD series these days, and honestly, the quality of the episodes more than makes up for it.

The bottom line:
Buy this if you enjoyed the other seasons, or if you're a fan of twisted and dysfunctional family comedies, ala Married With Children, the Family Guy, etc.",1165622400,2,813,4.704225352112676
2382262,5,B000A9QKRI,"There's so much to say about Arrested Development that it can't all be said in this review box alone.  As the second season of the critically acclaimed but low rated show picks up, Michael (Jason Bateman) learns his father George (Jeffrey Tambor) has broken out of prison, and is soon forced to rejoin his dysfunctional family.  After that, there's loads of insane and hilarious moments peppered throughout this season, as Gob (Will Arnett) tries to get his magic show off the ground again, by any means necessary, and learns he has a long lost son, Buster (Tony Hale), in an act of defiance towards his mother Lucille (Jessica Walter), joins the army and eventually gets his hand bitten off by a seal (yes, you read that right), Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) and Tobias (David Cross) get seperated as Tobias auditions for the Blue Man Group, Lucille gets involved with George's twin brother Oscar (Tambor), George Michael (Michael Cera) tries to move on from his crush on his cousin Maeby (Alia Shawkat) by getting a pious girlfriend, which leads to even more hilarity (gee, imagine that).  There's a horde of guest stars this season too, including Julia Louis-Dreyfuss returning as a fakely blind lawyer who Michael had a one night stand with, that leads to something more unexpected, Henry Winkler as the family's dirty lawyer, Zach Braff, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, Alan Tudyk, and must see performances from Martin Short as an aging fitness guru, and the return of Liza Minelli as Lucille 2.  The cast is as excellent as ever, particularly Bateman who links everything together, and the hilarious and deadpan Cross who does his best work here since his run on Mr. Show.  All in all, by the season finale, you get the feeling that the show won't be around for much longer (and you'd be right) but Arrested Development managed to provide the right mix of laughs and smarts while pushing the envelope for what you can see on network TV.",1164240000,,1938,4.807807807807808

2382266,5,B000A9QKRI,"One thing about Arrested Development that I forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years.  What I found funny last year when I was watching the show is JUST as consistently funny now.  In fact, now that I understand the style of humor better, I think the show is even funnier now.

Fox had something good cooking with Arrested Development.  It seems whenever a show doesn't get the ratings a network wants, a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings.  It VERY rarely works, and sadly Arrested Development is another example of this.

I can't blame Fox for pulling the plug.  After all, they tried their hardest to promote the show.  I remember Sunday nights watching the Simpsons and during the commercials the people at Fox REALLY wanted viewers to tune in.  The writers of the show should be proud that Fox tried very hard to keep it on the air.  It's just unfortunate people didn't want to watch it.  I still believe if more people were willing to pay attention to the characters on the show and made a solid effort to get involved in the twisted storylines instead of assuming the show should be like a regular laugh track comedy, Arrested Development would be around today.

As it stands, 53 episodes are all we have of this great show.  Honestly, it's not enough, but will have to do.

Do we really NEED anymore laugh track comedies?  Aren't there more than enough of them on the air now?  Most of these shows people won't even recognize when they hear the name of them because there's so many.  Most comedies that feature a laughing audience are exactly the same, and they blend together.  One plainly obvious joke after another.  I'm bored just thinking about it.  We've reached a time when television has changed with all sorts of reality shows and whatnot, and changing the format of the comedy genre to a direction similar to Arrested Development is the right move, in my opinion.  The times need to change.

People make a big deal about Arrested Development because there's really NOTHING else like it on television.  That's why the show deserves all the 5-star ratings it has received here on amazon.  People wouldn't be praising the show so much if there wasn't a good reason for it.  Trust me, there's a reason for all the positive reviews.  Buy one of the DVD season sets, pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave, watch the show *carefully* and experience the joy so many people are raving about.",1160611200,,2509,4.594594594594595
2382267,5,B000A9QKRI,"If you loved the first season then you will love this one as well. Some of the characters  and plots are a little bit crazier than the first season. It doesn't get old or stale like some shows do. It seems that the show kept on being way out there compared to other shows instead of trying to copy them for better ratings.

Anyways, like I said if you were a fan of the first season then you will also love this one so hurry up and buy it and tell'em you heard about it from me. Not that you will get a discount or anything but it would be nice to get some recognition every once and a while.",1159920000,,592,3.925
2382268,5,B000A9QKRI,Fox seems to come out with some of the best shows and then for some reason they start changing things around. Every Sunday night my family was sure to be watching Fox.

2382269,5,B000A9QKRI,"Arrested Development was the funniest television comedy I have ever seen.  It is the only show I have ever cared enough about to be depressed when it was cancelled.  The ensemble that was put together for this show is amazing, the writing is stellar and the pace and lack of a laugh track were such a breath of fresh air.  Season 2 is impressive because it gets even more manic than the debut season and yet never goes over the edge into unwatchability.  I was going to say it never jumps the shark, but those of us who watch know that it did. ; )  I hope this translates into continued success for everyone involved, because this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I am glad to have been one of the paltry 5 million or so that embraced this incredible series.  Both seasons 1 and 2 will hold up to repeated viewings - I've seen every episode at least 3 times.  I was going to talk about my favorite characters and actors, but since that changed every week, it's difficult.  I do love that Jason Bateman had a sort of career renaissance on this show - I would not have realized how comedically brilliant he is without his dry wit and impeccable delivery in the role of Michael.  He was always spot on, and provided the perfect foil for the more eccentric rest of the family.  If you never watched AD when it was airing, do yourself a favor and rent it from the local video store or Netflix.  You will probably either end up completely confused or you will buy the whole set.

One last note: seeing some of the drivel Fox broadcasts, it makes me sad that their one phenomenal success couldn't stay on the air.  ""American Dad?""  ""The War at Home?""  Please.

Since it just gets exponentially better and better from season to season, it could theoretically been good enough to tear a hole in space-time about mid-way through season five.

The best thing about this season is the new sad walking-away music.  It totally blows the Hulk's theme out of the water.

There are some good summaries already posted here on Amazon, so I'll focus on how I think the DVDs are worthy of purchase.

Season two of Arrested Development is terrific. It is a bit bawdier than season one, in my opinion. The cancellation axe was wielding over the show through much of the season, and the writers decided to push the envelope a bit, even making fun of Fox and the show's fate in several episodes.

Arrested Development is about as perfect as I could imagine a comedy ever being. It is witty, fast-paced, bawdy and brilliant.

The Season Two DVD set includes a lot of background and information. It is definitely worth purchasing, as it his highly entertaining!

Some of the jokes are very subtle, some are very obvious. This show demands that you watch each episode more than once, as many of the jokes become more apparent in a second or third viewing. You just can't catch them all the first time. Also, there is a lot of very subtle foreshadowing in many episodes.

I will never tire of watching this show. It is guaranteed to give you many belly laughs and funny one-liners you'll never forget. There are jokes in this show that make me laugh so hard that I get tears in my eyes, even the third or fourth time I've seen them.

Every time I loan AD DVDs to friends to watch, they are instantly addicted and mesmerized by the brilliant comedy - the writing, acting, and production.

Alas, the show officially ended its run today - creator Mitch Hurwitz announced that he will not continue with the series. Fortunately, the show was wrapped up brilliantly in the final episodes on this DVD set.

Arrested Development is by far the funniest and smartest show on television. I do not know if it is your lack of desire, or a fundamental inability to promote worthwhile television, but your decision to cancel Arrested Development is thoughtless, ignorant, and downright irresponsible.

It is extremely shortsighted for you to blame the show itself for its failure - everyone I know who can find the show on your constantly in-flux schedule watches it religiously. It is your job to inform the audience of show, let alone promote it properly, and give it a permanent time-slot so that it is accessible.

Arrested Development was my last bastion of thoughtful, intelligent, and clever programming on network television - if you cancel it, I am done with Fox, as with the rest of the networks. Further, I will boycott your sponsors just on principal. I will take my viewership and consumer spending to Amazon.com to purchase the television shows you cancel, and the Comedy Channel and premium cable and their sponsors, who give their audience credit for being able to digest more than just reality TV garbage, recycled sitcom insult-a-thons, and videos of when things attack.

2382433,5,B000A9QKRI,"If you're not sure you wish to purchase this DVD then don't. BORROW the DVD from your local library or a friend or co-worker who is a fan. Give the show your undivided attention and I promise it will all be worth it. After going through the first two seasons (the only 2 seasons on DVD at the time this was written) you'll want to buy yourself a copy.

I wrote an almost identical review for season 1 so if if you've read something like this before you can skip onto the next reviewer who will more likely than not, have excellent things to say about this brilliant show.

I am a big fan of the show, and I believe it is on the same level if not better than Seinfeld. Most would argue this is an insult to Seinfeld, but I like to think that it's a comment on how great this show really is.

Some have said that this show has ""zero re-watchability,"" but this is entirely inaccurate. I've gone through seasons 1 and 2, and some of season 3, and went back and started over and many who have done so will notice so many more jokes they may have missed before simply because this show is layered with jokes, some of which cannot be understood until you've seen more episodes. Perhaps some may feel this is where the show's weakpoint lies: instead of episodic one-time jokes the show sets up these long joke-arcs -- but if the audience is patient they'll be rewarded with a much bigger payoff (also this style is conducive to loyalty to the show, as you'd have to watch more episodes to understand it all).

I find the show to be unbelievably funny, every minute something funny is going on. Sometimes I don't catch onto it but I usually watch the episodes two or three times, not because I want to but because I have to simply to catch things I missed.

Some argue the cast is ""no-name"" and has no talent, and as a result the show is forced to bring on guest stars. Although most of the cast is new there are some regular cast members who are well known (Tambor, Cross, Rossi). The new actors are every bit as talented in their roles -- anyone who has seen the show must admit the young Michael Cera (playing George Michael) is a delight, his comic timing and acting are superb. My guess is the guest stars were brought on as tools to bring more viewers into the fold. Yet these guest stars each played a memorable role, not some 1-episode stint (except season 3's Andy Richter, well at least so far). Will Arnet's character, GOB, was briefly married and the woman was played by Will Arnet's real-life wife Amy Poehler. There are a couple of jokes which make reference to this and of course they're funny.

There are many jokes on the show which may not seem obvious at first but with a little research you'll be surprised by how much you might've missed. (example: Tony Hale, as Buster, doing the 'Robot' in his car in season 3, which was a throwback to the actor's Mr. Roboto dance in the VW commercials).

Please don't think this show is too much work, not worth the effort -- you WILL get the jokes, and you'll get them better if you re-watch the episodes.

This show has no laugh track and, to the best of my knowledge, is not taped in front of a live studio audience, and that is good: the reason this show is so good goes beyond the excellent acting and timing of the actors .. the writing, directing and editing of each episode is near genius.

I'm sorry to hear the show's been cancelled but in my opinion this is one of the best comedy show's ever made. If any of the show's crew or staff read this, all your efforts were not in vain, you've made many laugh and fall in love with The Bluths.",1136764800,11,3596,4.299852289512556
2382434,5,B000A9QKRI,"Season 1 of ""Arrested Development"" was something like a television Brigadoon. It appeared out of the fog of failed and dying sitcoms and lasted a full and funny 22 episodes. At the end of that season many fans and critics assumed that the low rated show was doomed to fade back into the mist, but a second and eventually third season would be had.

The following two seasons however would be reduced to 18 and 11 episodes respectively. The second season specifically is a little weaker and uneven. The comedy also tends to be broader, and sillier. Despite this, the show still shines as the best comedy on television.

In season two the Bluth family is recovering from the lost of their father, George Bluth Senior. A lost that took Bluth all the way to Mexico as he fled from federal custody for a number of white collar crimes he was accused of in the first season. Michael Bluth, the middle son, tries desperately to keep his father's company afloat despite the petty selfish medalling from the rest of his family.

While George Sr. is on the run, brother in law Tobias Funke becomes obsessed with The Blue Man Group, 16 year old Maybe Funke cons her way into a job at a Hollywood production company, George Micheal (Michael Bluth's son) falls hard for fundamentalist Christian, and Buster Bluth, the youngest and most sheltered of George Sr.'s sons joins the Army. The whole show plays out like a twisted comedic version of Dynasty.

We are also introduced to,  Girls with Low Self Esteem producer  Phillip Lit (played by Zach Braff)... funny, rich but not related by blood Uncle Jack (played by Martin Short)...not that funny, and Stan Sitwell (played be Ed Begley Jr.) a competitor of the Bluth company..weird but really funny. Plus many recurring characters from the first season are back to confront and confound the Bluth's.

Currently the show looks like it will now fall back into the fog. The latest word from FOX is that ""Arrested Development""  will be canceled. Unless cable comes to the rescue, it appears like this Brigadoon is about to be lost forever.",1136764800,2,2069,4.727777777777778

This DVD of Season Two has a moderate amount of special features, but the most important aspect is the show itself, and this season is brilliant.

2382436,5,B000A9QKRI,"How can FOX cancel this show ??  UGGHHH!!!!!!

It looks as if Arrested Development's development has finally been arrested after two and a half years. Despite multiple Emmy nominations and wins, rapturous reviews from critics and fans, and a change of airdate, audiences continued to stay away. The network seemed to blame the producers for making the series too smart, while the producers implied that it was our fault the show was failing. I'll throw the blame directly at Fox. In Fall 2004, the company released the show's first season on DVD in an attempt to drum up interest in season two. I immediately became hooked, watched the set practically in one sitting, and vowed to watch season two when it was broadcast on Fox. This became easier said than done. Because of the vagaries of Sunday afternoon football schedules, Arrested Development never ran at its regularly scheduled time. It was impossible to even tape the show. I gave up, deciding to again wait for a DVD release. Now I've finished watching the brilliant Arrested Development: Season Two just in time for the series' cancellation.

For those of you unfamiliar with the series - Arrested Development focuses on the Bluths, a family of California eccentrics (to put it kindly) who have amassed a fortune in frozen bananas and real estate development. In season one, family patriarch George Sr. (The Larry Sanders Show's Jeffrey Tambor) was thrown in prison for using the businesses' funds as his own personal bank till. His wife, Lucille (Jessica Walter), doesn't much care, as long as her line of credit at the liquor store is still good. Eldest son George ""Gob"" Bluth Jr. (Will Arnett) is a failed Segway-riding magician who more often kills his animal assistants than makes them disappear. College educated Michael (Little House on the Prairie's Jason Bateman) is seemingly the most normal of the Bluths, but the fact that he wants to run the family company throws his sanity into question. Michael's twin sister Lindsay (Ally McBeal's Portia de Rossi), is a self-styled social activist whose latest cause is having an open marriage. Youngest son Buster (Tony Hale) is so emotionally and mentally stunted that he brings new meaning to the phrase ""mama's boy.""

At the end of season one, Michael became fed up with his ungrateful family. It didn't help that his father escaped from jail, adding to his headaches. Michael decides to gather up George-Michael and head out of town, but is horrified to learn that his father signed a deal to build a subdivision in Iraq for Saddam Hussein. The scandal would, of course, ruin the family. And as president of the company, Michael would be held responsible. Will he stick around and help his family out of its latest mess?

Arrested Development does not have the look or feel of a traditional sitcom. Its rhythms are closer to those of animated shows like The Simpsons and ""mockumentaries"" like The Office. The actors and writers can take the wildest material imaginable and make it seem perfectly reasonable. Tobias sees an audition flyer for Blue Man Group and attends, thinking it's a support group for depressed men. He gets hired to become an understudy - or at least he thinks he does since no one involved in the troupe actually gives him the job. He walks around for the rest of the season covered in blue body paint, leaving blue blotches on every surface he comes near. (As he tells Michael, ""I blue myself!"")

And that's not even the weirdest stuff that goes on. Lucille enlists Buster in the Army after being confronted by filmmaker Michael Moore. Buster swims in the ocean for the first time, is attacked by a bowtie-wearing seal, and loses his hand in the process. He spends the rest of the season alternating between menacing his family with a hook and a wax hand. In true Arrested Development fashion, Gob was actually responsible for dumping the carnivorous seal in the ocean. One of his tricks went bad, a feral cat jumped into the seal's trunk, and now the creature has a taste for blood for animals larger than fish. Buster runs into his ex-girlfriend, Lucille 2 (Liza Minnelli) at a drag club called The Queen Mary. Lucille fires her maid and ""hires"" a Roomba to take her place.

Season two is also fixated on Peanuts. In ""Good Grief,"" a depressed George-Michael shuffles down the street to the tune of ""Christmas Time Is Near,"" walking past a giant red doghouse with a beagle sleeping atop it. And Buster, for some unknowable reason, refers to his genitalia as his Linus and Charlie Browns. An odd tribute, perhaps, but funny nevertheless.

The season isn't quite perfect. Sometimes it tries too hard. Martin Short's appearance as Uncle Jack in ""Ready, Aim, Marry Me!"" reeks of unfunny desperation. Ben Stiller as a pretentious magician in ""The Sword of Destiny"" is also a bit tiresome. These appearances detract from the show and its regular characters. Admittedly, the producers obviously did this to help goose ratings. It didn't work, though, so hopefully it isn't employed too often in their abbreviated season three.

Other guests in the second season include Henry Winkler (Happy Days), Thomas Jane, Martin Mull, Malik Yoba, Ed Begley Jr. (St.. Elsewhere), Andy Richter, Jeff Garlin (Curb Your Enthusiasm), J.K. Simmons (Oz), Christine Taylor, Julia-Louis Dreyfus (Seinfeld), Amy Poehler (SNL), Carl Weathers, Dave Attell (Insomniac), Dan Castellanta (The Simpsons), Ione Skye, Alan Tudyk, Mario Joyner, Dick Van Patten, Zach Braff (Scrubs), and producer Marc Cherry (Desperate Housewives).

Be sure to watch the ""Next time..."" bits at the end of each episode. They have nothing whatsoever to do with the episode that follows. Instead, they feature funny gags that continue that episode's storylines.

The eighteen episodes that make up season two are divided onto three discs. The discs are housed in slim, clear keepcases. The front covers are predominantly prison jumpsuit orange. The back covers feature episode titles, airdates, writing and directing credits, and brief synopses. Also included are a few stills from the series and a listing of the extras found on the discs. The interiors are simply white. The three keepcases slide into a cardboard sleeve, each side decorated with group photos of the cast. The cardboard case cleverly slides into a plastic outer sleeve. As with the first season, the overall design is simple and appealing.

The DVD menus are also chic and stylish, mimicking the series' opening credits. Clips from the series play in windows on the main menu. From this menu, viewers can choose to play all episodes, access the extras and languages menus, or access the episode selection menu. The episodes are divided into chapters, but there are no scene selection menus.

But, let me speak based on what I've seen. I've gathered that this is by far one of the funniest shows ever. I have never seen a show more well-written, and well executed on FOX. I was surprised. This show is an emmy award-winner, and deservedly so. The use of ""The Final Countdown"" is extremely hilarious.

The fact that this show is being cancelled is a travesty. What is FOX going to replace it with? Another ""quality"" program like ""Stacked"", or another lame wife-swapping crapathon?

2382438,5,B000A9QKRI,"Warning:  Some spoilers below

After a debut season that saw ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT win the Emmy for Best Comedy and just generally demonstrate that it was the most original new American comedy series in years, the show continued with a brilliant second season, more awards and critical acclaim, but still astonishingly few viewers.  Fans of the show wonder why everyone isn't watching it.  It has one of the most brilliant ensemble casts in memory, vastly higher production values of virtually all other American comedies (most are filmed before live audiences and minimal sets, which means few camera set ups, relatively inexpensive sets, and all around lowered costs), and brilliant writing that is genuinely funny.  I don't ever remember laughing at an episode of FRIENDS or EVERYBODY LOVE RAYMOND or countless other American sit coms that elicit smiles at most.  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is one of the few truly funny shows American TV has produced.  Typically, as I write this review the show has had only 13 episodes ordered for the 2005-2006 season and although it has not been officially cancelled, no one imagines that it will be back on FOX for the 2006-2007 season.  The hopes of fans of the show have been bolstered of late, however, by the fact that both ABC and Showtime are interested in picking up the show.  While there is ""many a slip between the cup and the lip,"" this interest in a rational world seems not merely good news but inevitable.  What network wouldn't want to pick up the best comedy on TV?  On various boards fans are already lusting at a scenario whereby ABC pick up LOST and puts it on immediately before LOST, thereby creating the finest hour and a half of television of the week.

If the show is not back next year, at least we have these brilliant DVDs.  I never fail to be astonished at both the marvelous creativity of the show's writers and the wonderful executive by the production team.  Just consider one thing:  most comedies are shot on stage and feature two or three cameras situated to capture the performances.  The notion of montage is irrelevant for such shows.  But ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT can feature a three-minute segment with a montage of 7 or 8 completely different set ups.  The time spent on producing a single episode must be extraordinary compared to a show like FRIENDS, where virtually all of the cost of the show is expended on salary, as opposed to ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, where the production costs are as large as the time expended making it.  If the show does go away after the painfully truncated Season Three, these DVDs will still be there to remind us of what a high quality production that we lost.

And the cast!  I've played a game with my friends who are fans of the show.  I've asked them both to name their favorite cast member and the one they think was most expendable.  In each cast they found the first task difficult and the second impossible.  A couple said they perhaps liked Jason Bateman as Michael Bluth the most, but not especially more than the others.  But no one is dispensable.  Take away any cast member and the show would be diminished thereby.

One thing I especially like about the show is the way that it continues a trend in television, a trend that a large number of the best shows on TV hold in common.  More and more shows are engaging in longer and longer story arcs, so that now the stories can extend over several seasons.  In this case, George Bluth, the head of the Bluth clan, has been imprisoned for financial wrongdoing at the Bluth Construction Company.  To make matter worse, it appears that he may have committed treason by building inside Iraq during the embargo.  At the end of Season One George escaped from jail and in Season Two he is ensconced in the attic of the model home many of the family members live in.  This overarching narrative holds the show as a whole together.  Along the way we get a host of ongoing jokes, such as Gob's (pronounced like Job, as in the Book of Job in the OT) countless pathetic magic tricks, the icky relationship between Lucille and her son Buster, and George's secretary Kitty flashing her artificially enhanced chest (so that she can appear on the video series ""Girls With Low Self-Esteem"") with the warning, ""This is the last time you'll see these.""  George-Michael has transferred his romantic intentions away from his cousin Maeby (who despite being 15 and in high school has somehow managed to become a Hollywood movie producer) to a Christian fundamentalist named Ann (whose minister father was played by the versatile Alan Tudyk, who in one calendar year played the robot in I, ROBOT, a pirate imitator in DODGEBALL, and a space ship pilot in SERENITY).  Tobias, meanwhile, striving to become an actor, has aspirations of joining the Blue Man Group (throughout the season, one sees random smudges of blue on the walls of the model home), while his wife Lindsay and he have agreed to have an open marriage, though neither manages to have a successful encounter with anyone else.  And poor Buster has his hand bitten off by a seal in the ocean, a seal that was accustomed to the taste of mammal flesh by none other than Gob.  The great string of guest appearances continued through out the season, with Season One performers such as Henry Winkler, Liza Minnelli, Carl Weathers, Judy Greer, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus joined by actors like Ben Stiller, Ed Begley Jr., Christine Taylor, Martin Short, Ione Skye, Dick Van Patten, and Zach Braff.  All this nuttiness has created what is for me the lone ""must see"" comedy show of the past ten years or so.  I just hope that after this year it hasn't become ""can't see"" TV.",1135641600,19,5661,4.708629441624366

Every episode presents solidly strong comedic writing, acting, and production.  So, join the cult and buy Season 2 of A.D.  You won't be disappointed.

I can understand to an extent why A.D. struggles on TV.  The jokes in the episodes assume that you watched previous episodes.  One has to understand the traits of each character.  The plots build on each other.  So, that's why A.D. works so well as a DVD.  A.D. is a show where the episodes flow well together, and with the DVD one can follow the Bluth family adventures one at a time, or watch  numerous episodes together.

The extras on the DVD are limited and not impressive.  The commentaries are uninteresting (too many cast members with nothing special to say) and the other extras do not add much to the DVD.  However, the episodes are so strong that the DVD is simply a must-get.

2382441,5,B000A9QKRI,"Only a brilliant show like Arrested Development could have one of its main characters lose his right hand to an angry seal and make it not only work, but help the show. The character is Buster (Tony Hale), who gets out of going in the Army because of the seal attack. Oh yeah, and the addition of a hook and the catchphrase 'I'M A MONSTER!' make it work even more.
 So why isn't anyone watching the show? (If you're a loyal fan and reading this, skip this paragraph) Why is Stacked getting more viewers, and the O.C.? And Desperate Housewives, people? Maybe these shows (except Stacked) are a guilty pleasure, but they're not in any way, shape, or form as original and funny as Arrested Development. Where are the O.C.'s Emmys? Who got the writing awards for comedy? Who has an executive producer and narrator named Ron Howard, who's made Oscar-winning movies? DAMN YOU!
 Okay, that's done, now the good part.

(Okay, Charlize Theron's 3rd season, but that got your attention, huh?) The whole cast is in fine form, and they have these characters down beautifully.
 So there you have it: great casting, clever writing, big name stars doing plotlines, uniqueness, Emmy-winning, Oscar-winning producer. You're right, Stacked deserves your attention.",1134950400,6,2206,4.8773333333333335
2382452,5,B000A9QKRI,"I'm as big a fan as any of the popular sitcoms out there - from Friends to Scrubs to Everybody Loves Raymond - but I have to put my love for those aside and give attention to the one sitcom that stands head and shoulders above them: Arrested Development.

Comedy is a skill, an art, and a craft. It takes patience, timing, and intelligence to produce something truly witty. It is clear from Season 2 that the cast and writers of Arrested Development have the synergy and vision to do it together.

I guzzled down the first two DVDs in a marathon overnight session. I sorely missed the show in the yearlong gap between the DVD releases, and I wanted to know what happened after George Bluth Sr. escaped from the hospital. Would he be found? Was Michael really leaving the family? And what incredibly bizarre situations would the Bluths find themselves in?

I can't count the number of times I had to pause the DVD because I was laughing too hard to catch the rest of the dialogue. From the abundance of puns (""Watch out for loose seal!""  ""I'm not afraid of Lucille!"") to the presence of over-the-top guest stars (Ben Stiller, Martin Short) to the little attentions to detail (blue hand marks around the house during Tobias' Blue Man phase), this show demonstrates time and time again a genuine love of humor. The audience will appreciate it too.

I think the most telling part of my reaction to this show is how impossible it is to pick a favorite character or episode. Each character is so well-acted, each installment so well-written, that picking a favorite is folly. I love every moment of this show. Two too-short seasons and I'm already a fanatic.

I've purchased 4 more copies of this DVD as gifts for my friends. I am voting with my dollar on this show. Fox, keep Arrested Development alive!",1134777600,4,1798,4.585669781931464

Arrested Development is, without question, the most clever, witty, and flat-out hilarious show on television.  Please, let's all pitch in to keep it alive by purchasing the DVDs.

2382458,5,B000A9QKRI,"The second season of ""Arrested Development"" was just as rewarding as the first. While I appreciate that Fox kept the show on as long as it did, it's clear that there was a marginal promotional effort to make this critically acclaimed show a success (in fact a columnist from the S.F. Chronicle confirmed as much when he spoke to unnamed sources at Fox). That's too bad because the funniest show on TV has now been cancelled due to the dysfunctional family at Fox who are almost as bad but not as entertaining as the Bluth family.

During the second season Michael(the droll and funny Jason Bateman) resigned as president of Bluth Homes not because he didn't feel he could pull the company together (which his family constantly sabotaged)but because his father broke out of jail and disappeared. When evidence comes up that his father George (the very funny Jeffrey Tambor)signed a contract to build homes with Saddam in Iraq, Michael could be put in jail because he was head of the company and there's no proof he didn't sign the documents. Meanwhile Gob (Will Arnett) continues to use magic to mystify and destroy his own life. When George is pronounced dead, Gob is determined to be buried in his place and ""rise from the grave"" to acclaim so he can make the cover of Poof magazine (the magazine for magicians). Meanwhile Lucille family matriarch (Jessica Walter) finds herself rekindling an affair with George's twin brother (also Jeffrey Tambor).  Buster (Tony Hale) is enlisted in the army at the after Michael Moore confronts Lucille about her patriotism and supposed involvement with iilegal stuff in Iraq. Sounds as convoulted as a soap opera doesn't it? That's what makes the show so darn funny. ""Arrested Development"" is the ""Soap"" and ""Seinfeld"" of its day redefining without the respect and audience it deserves.

At least Fox Home Video has done right by the show. Nicely packaged in a see through sleeve with the discs housed individually within slimline cases, the packaging is only the tip of the iceberg for how this terrific show is presented. The extras include commentary tracks by cast and writers/directors, deleted scenes and a blooper reel, the first seaon in three minutes, ""The Immaculation Election"" campagin videos. Oh, and all 18 season two uncut episodes.

""Arrested Development"" is a great package at a gret price. Like ""Seinfeld"" it's one of those comedy shows that you'll never grow tired of. The image quality is excellent with rich colors and hardly any issues with compression artifacts. The soundtrack is crystal clear throughout this season set.

My wife had pity on me and gave me an early Xmas gift and let me relive the second season just as the third (and final) season is winding down. Between this, ""Supernatural"", ""Battlestar Galatica"", ""24"" and ""Desperate Housewives"" (even with a weaker second season) we have the top five TV shows currently on TV.

The show is so witty and fresh that the writers have to take jokes out when scripting episodes. AD is the best show on television on right now; it is certainly worthy of the title as Greatest Comedy in television history.

Too bad I've already bought the two seasons because I would go out and buy them specifically for the reason of supporting this show. This show is absolutely hilarious and so awesome, I would watch it if it remained on for 10 seasons or more. The jokes are great, and the way the cast interacts with each other, the chemistry is great! I can't wait until they bring the 3rd season to DVD, because I will be standing in line at the check-out with my copy. Absolutely brilliant. I cannot say enough good things about it.

Okay, well it's actually been about three weeks now and i have had time to move now onto the third disc.  But it is true I have shown this show to all of my housemates, my friends and made new friends because of enjoyment of this show.

It's very well written, acted and edited.  There's so much that happens, but you can still watch a random episode or two and enjoy it thoroughly.  I would recommend watching a string of episodes in a row when first watching though, to get used to all the characters and pacing.  But once you do, you'll be hooked.

I haven't even seen the first season yet, and I bought and loved this DVD after seeing a minimarathon of four episodes.

Ive got my entire house of 5x 21 year old guys, a slew of our friends and my 50 year old parents all loving this show.  One of us in the house is watching this DVD almost everyday.  Especially because of the fastpaced nature of the show, you're bound to miss something and there are needs for second and third viewings.  I notice a new joke everytime.

Now whats really important to know is that FOX is thinking of cancelling the show.

A baffling decision seeing as its already won Emmys, and has a great cult following.  But hopefully if people do buy a lot of these DVDs they will realize this following and keep it on the air.  Also make sure you sign any petitions you see for keeping the show on the air!  Please!  Don't let shows like this fade away.",1132272000,5,1655,4.300970873786408

BUT BE WARNED!!!  You are going to have to check the date and time on the fox website, b/c they are NOTORIOUS for moving the show all over the schedule.

1. Check the Fox website frequenly for updates.

2. Watch the show.

3. Laugh your butt off.

2382475,5,B000A9QKRI,"This is by far the funniest show I have ever watched, and I have watched a lot of TV. What distances Arrested Development from other comedies so well is that it GETS BETTER upon repeated viewings. It doesn't matter if you know what happens in the plot - the writers are just so brilliantly fantastic that they seemingly not only cram a joke into every LINE, but also into the background. The simplest throwaway lines have made me crack up in laughter upon second viewing a countless number of times.

While the partly-slapstick nature of this show might make characters or events seem over-the-top, once you get engaged in the world of Arrested Development, you won't even notice. It's simply magical. The show is so ridiculously layered, it's unfathomable. Each episode is absolutlely chock-filled with every type of comedy, from the silly, to the subtle, to the oh-so-VERY-dirty. I have loaned my DVD set or bought new ones for many friends, and not a single one has not fallen for this show. The unfortunate problem I encounter is people who have not watched the series from the beginning often feel confused when tuning in to a current episode, and don't really ""get it"". But boy, does that change in a hurry once they start from episode 1.

As for what FOX has just done, I want to go on a profanity-laced tirade, but I can't. All I can say is that they are making a huge mistake - a disappointment of gargantuan disappointments.

Arrested Development is not ""too smart"" for the average viewer; there is plenty of obvious humour to complement the transcendental subtle variety. The characters are cast perfectly, to a tee.

The Nielson ratings are a TOTAL SHAM. The people in charge need to take a rudimentary statistics course to understand that extrapolating data from 5,000 households whose viewing habits are tracked ONLY BY CONSENT is most certainly not representative of a population of around 300 million people. Additionally, as AD is a show that relies on re-watching to fully appreciate its sublimity, many people rely on Tivo or DVR to record the show - and these aren't factored into those bloody Nielson ratings!

I am a university student myself, and literally everybody I know is a fanatic of the show - talking to my friends, this is the case for their friends' friends, and so on. Arrested Development might not gain big numbers from demographics that include low-income households or over 60s, but WHO CARES? These are not people who will be purchasing many of the products companies advertise during the show anyway. Data from last year placed Arrested Development in the top percentiles of viewership in high-income households. My point? Viewership ratings can be interpreted in any which way because they are so horribly flawed, and for a show of this calibre, boasting more critical acclaim and award nominations than any show in a LONG time, this is simply not a good enough reason for cancellation. Hell, Stacked, Bernie Mac, That 70s Show, and Malcolm in the Middle are still airing on FOX? Un-freaking-believable.

I should note that the cancellation is NOT official - but as quoted by Jason Bateman, ""the writing's pretty much on the wall."" However, we can still do the most we can to save the show, and buying DVDs is a great way to chip in. Right now, Seasons 2 and 1 are ranked as the #1 and #2 best sellers out of ALL of Amazon's DVDs. That kind of loyalty to a show is unrivaled; AD has been selling better on Amazon than Family Guy for quite a while now.

Folks, make it such that despite the ratings, FOX will have an incredibly difficult time officially cancelling this show once they run out of time and have to make an official, public decision. Until they officially say so, there is still a sliver of hope, and if you haven't watched the show yet, please trust me (how many other DVD sets have not only 5 star overall ratings, but so few under 5 stars, and virtually none under 4?).

The show is REALLY that good. If you haven't heard of it by now, it is probably because FOX inexplicably refuses to promote it (compare that to NBC's marketing of the most definitely inferior My Name is Earl).

Word-of-mouth is basically the only way people find out about Arrested Development, and it's a real pity.

We can all do our part to try to save this show--by writing letters to FOX (or even other networks encouraging them to pick it up if FOX cancels it), by spreading the word about this show, and by buying the DVDs.

Buy the DVDs for yourself and for everyone you know who would enjoy a hilarious, creative show this Christmas.  Trust me, this show is the best!",1132012800,2,578,4.415094339622642

My hope is that HBO will pick it up to pair with Curb Your Enthusiasm or Extras. 2)Like Family Guy, dvd sales are enough to justify ordering more episodes. With that in mind, here's what I propose, if you love this show, make the Season 1 & Season 2 dvd sets the only gifts you give your friends (who would enjoy the show, but may or may not watch it already) this christmas.

It is so densely layered that it gets funnier and funnier every time you watch it, which makes it perfect to own on DVD.

The cast is brilliant. Who knew that Jason Bateman was such a genius at dry humor? Every member of the cast is superb, but my favorite may be Michael Cera as George Michael Bluth, the awkward teenage son of Jason Bateman's character, Michael. It is remarkable to see a teenager actor who is so keenly aware of the subtleties of teenage awkwardness.

Arrested Development's current season has been cut down due to low ratings, virtually assuring the cancellation of the show, but as we learned from the miraculous comeback of The Family Guy, it is possible to turn this around. The Family Guy's comeback is owed to stellar DVD sales. If you are a fan of this show or of intelligent comedy in general, please buy the DVDs... and soon, before Fox sets up its next schedule.

2382514,5,B000A9QKRI,"Now granted, when I first heard that Jason Bateman was fronting the cast of Arrested Development my first thought was that this was a financial blessing.  I already owned his poster from his ""Family Ties"" days, so I had that going for me.  But where to hang it?  I certainly couldn't move my ""Guffman"" cast photo, reposition my ""Remains of the Day"" lunch box, or adjust my snap of Jeremy Piven and me hugging it out (I love photoshop).  I was in a quandary.  I tabled the decision pending my review of the Season 2 DVD.

Enter Tobias and the Blue Man Group, Lindsey's ""Volvo,"" Buster's Army induction and discharge, ""solid as a rock,"" hermano, a great Saddam Hussein thread, Charlie Browns, Ice (bounty hunter and party planner), Ann, Kitty, and Gob turning 100 dollars into a hundred pennies.  With the notable exception of the Entourage team, no other TV writers expect so much from their viewers and reward them so well for their loyalty.  This is a can't miss DVD.

So where did I hang my poster of Jason Bateman?  That, my friends, is for British eyes only...",1131580800,2,1064,4.582010582010582
2382515,4,B000A9QKRI,"I thought Season 1 of this show was the most hilarious thing I'd ever seen on TV.  Never had I sat on my couch and actually laughed out loud at a TV show.  Unfortunately, Season 2 is not QUITE that funny.  The jokes seem a little more crude and something just falls short.  It's still a lot funnier than a lot of what I've seen on TV and several cuts (or seal-bites perhaps) above other shows but it simply doesn't live up to the first season, which is one of the reasons I have to regretfully remove one star.

Another reason is because not all of the promised extras are actually included.  The packaging promises ""Campaign videos from the 'Immaculate Election' episode"" but after looking in the Special Features section of all three discs, I didn't find them.  Maybe they're an easter egg?  I was extremely disappointed by not finding them, because I think that's one of the funniest episodes in the season and would have liked to see those videos.  (A third reason, albeit a minor one, is the packaging itself -- having to remove the entire boxed set from a slipcover before getting to the individual discs is pretty annoying.)

And my final reason is that a lot of things are dropped with no explanation or warning.  What ever happened to Anyung?  He just disappeared and none of the characters ever mention him anymore.  What the heck is THAT about?  It's even more baffling than when they abruptly replaced Marta last season with another (far less attractive) actress.  Things like that happen a few times (I don't want to give too much away but you'll see if you watch.) and they also introduce major things with no real explanation.  Gob is Steve Holt's father???  Hello, when are we going to hear more about THAT?

In spite of the problems, several episodes stand out and still made me laugh out loud, including ""Immaculate Election"", ""Good Grief"", ""Sword of Destiny"" and ""Meet the Veals"".  There's a lot to love about this season -- Tobias' stint in the Blue Man Group (and the streaks he leaves around the model home for episodes afterward), all the clues leading up to Buster's accident, Ben Stiller's cameo appearance as Tony Wonder, Franklin the puppet and all the Liza Minelli scenes, just to name a few.  Zach Braff and Christine Taylor also make appearances, and Carl Weathers pops up as well.  Hopefully the show won't become entirely dependant on its guest stars for humor as it ages, a la ""Will & Grace.""

Bottom line: still better than any other comedy currently on television, even if it ISN'T funnier than last season.  Well worth the price of the DVD set (only $30!) even if it doesn't have all its promised extras.  Four happy yellow stars -- even if they aren't really that happy.",1131148800,4,2707,4.626834381551363
2382516,5,B000A9QKRI,"I was listening to a radio interview with the creator of this brilliant, critically-praised, ratings-challenged show, and the subject of his Emmy acceptance speech came up.  When ""Arrested Development"" won, he said something like, ""The Academy says it's great, so why isn't anybody watching it?""  During the interview, he also mentioned that while the ratings are poor, the DVDs sell well.

I was thinking, ""Here's another great show, like 'freaks & geeks,' that's just going to go down the tubes.""  But then it occurred to me, *I* don't watch the show.  At least not when it's broadcast.  Between time-slot shifts and baseball delays, I'm not even sure I know what night it comes on anymore.  During the first two seasons, I kept missing it until finally I just wound up catching them all when they hit disk.

That got me thinking that ""Arrested Development"" really benefits from the DVD format.  Stripped of commercials, each episode is really just under 20 minutes.  And with such detail-heavy, in-joke-oriented plots and characters, this is a show that improves when you can sit down and watch three episodes in an hour, rather than watch it week-by-week, shot through with ads and Fox pop-up promotions.

Given the popularity of TiVo and DVR's, and the continued endurance of VHS (as I can't afford most modern technology, I actually don't watch any shows as they're broadcast, but tape them and watch them afterward, so I can pause, skip commercials and rewind stuff I might watch to scrutinize), we may one day see the advent of shows that are produced to go straight to DVD, if they can figure out how to siphon profits from sources other than advertisements (though considering the staggering profits made from, say, ""Chapelle Show Season 2"" dvd's, they may not need other sources).

If we do see such programming, I hope it's as smart and funny as ""Arrested Development"" which, in its second season, has only grown more complex and brilliant.",1131148800,4,1952,4.9176829268292686
2382517,5,B000A9QKRI,"Other than the recent onslaught of random late night cartoons, no other show, especially no other ""real"" show has ever come close to the genius of Arrested Development.

Every actor seems to perfectly fit their character, and every actor is atleast funny sometimes. I can't even compare it to anything for you-almost like Family Guy randomness with Curb Your Enthusiasm's sarcasm and everyday life scenarios. It has this appeal that kids and adults could understand....while Gob is my favorite character, the very real and deliciously evil grandmother is my parents. I'm just glad this show isn't going to go unnoticed and taken off the air like other greats. If you like Adult Swim, Family Guy/Simpsons, Seinfeld, or really if you like laughing at your own families dsyfunctions like most do....Buy this DVD",1130112000,2,922,5.112582781456954

Bateman is without peer in his portrayal of Michael Bluth, and David Cross is over the top(and I am not really a fan of his, but Tobias is such a perfect character for him).

2382519,5,B000A9QKRI,"When this show first aired a couple of years ago, I enjoyed it more than any new TV show in YEARS.  I would say there was a good, solid laugh every 30 seconds or so.  When Season Two started (and thank good ness it did...I'm amazed Fox actually keeps renewing this low-rated masterpiece), I hoped it would live up to same standards.  I was concerned that the creators may have poured all their best ideas into the first frantic year.

Well, my fears were quickly set-aside.  I would say that now the laughs come every 20 seconds.  And again, the availability of this show on DVD is almost essential for the fan of AD.  You can finally get every joke.  So often, the best lines are practically mumbled by the actors...they seem to be toss-offs, but in fact they are rich in comedic meaning.

One great thing about the show is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to pick a favorite character.  For awhile, I thought it might be Tobias Funke, because the stuff when he tries to join Blue Man Group is priceless.  Some of the jokes around this subplot will stick with me for life.  But then we get to see Buster joining the army and all the ridiculous shenanigans involved with that.  Then there's George Michael (can I just say that the young man who plays this nervous teen is absolutely brilliant...he has found the comedic and emotional heart of his character with the lazar beam perfection of a seasoned pro), who's clueless relationship with his new girlfriend Anne is absolutely hysterical.  And we can always rely on Gob to mess up anything he touches.  I just can't decide who makes me laugh the most...which is great...there's never a moment when you say to yourself, ""oh, this guy, well hopefully this scene will be done soon so we can move on with the laughs.""  It's all good.

There are many terrific guest appearances, including Martin Mull as a private detective, Henry Winkler as the family attorney, a hysterical Ed Begley Jr. as a business rival (and an alopecia sufferer...no hair anywhere on his body!), Christine Taylor as a love interest for Michael, and of course, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as a blind (!?!), pregnant (?!!!?!!) attorney.  Also, Martin Short turns up for one episode playing what some call the funniest and others the creepiest character of the season.  They're both right...it's an amazingly zany performance.

And the anchor holding it all together is Jason Bateman, who has the part of ""straight-man,"" yet has the best comedic timing and some of the funniest lines in the cast.

The show is simply a brilliant achievement in TV comedy, and the DVD is a must-own...believe me, these shows hold up to repeated viewings.  I still laugh out loud the third time through! (The moment when a banana-suit clad Gob is lifted in the air by a crane operated by Buster never ceases to amaze!)

The DVD set is attractive.  The extras are relatively few (some deleted scenes and bloopers...nothing unforgettable or indispensable).  I haven't listened to the commentaries yet, so can't really offer an opinion there.  I was sorry to discover that season 1 had 22 episodes and season 2 only 18.  I hope the current Season 3 doesn't drop to 14 or something!!  BUY THESE DVDs!!!!  TELL A FRIEND!!  SAVE THE SHOW!!!!!!",1129852800,10,3218,4.704830053667263

I just wanted my coffee and some mints. When a dude came up and put his arm around her, even going so far as to put his hand in her jeans pocket. The tone of her voice changed to a more businesslike one, and she quickly ended the call.

2382540,5,B000A9QKRI,"There's one way to watch season 2 of ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT-in two 9-episode marathons. I'd say all at once, but, by no fault of the show's, most people (including myself) just get antsy sitting in the same spot for so long. So why watch it all at once? Because that's the only way to appreciate everything that this show has to offer. In order to appreciate each episode, every other episode must be fresh in your head. Every joke, every offhand comment, everything. In fact, you should make a point of watching season 1 before season 2 arrives in the mail (or before you go out and buy it), especially if you haven't already watched each season 1 episode over 5 times (chances are, if you're buying this DVD you're already a fan and you already own season 1, so you should have...if you haven't, then I should tell, what they say that each time you watch it you find something new...is right. At least until around the fourth time, and then you occasionally find something new, but it's still worth watching anyway).

Season 2 has tons of classics ...G.O.B. and Franklin, Buster's loose-seal ""accident"" (another reason why you should always go back and watch past episodes), Mae Whitman as the notoriously dull Egg, or, um...Anne-hog...er...um...Anne (whose school picture says underneath it ""NOT PICTURED""), Tobias and Lindsay's open-marriage, Buster's trip to Mexico, Martin Short as Uncle Jack, the return of Carl Weathers, G.O.B.'s constantly expanding  array of expensive suits, Tobias' return to being a never-nude, George Sr.'s tea parties and other attic expeditions, Gene Parmesan (AAAAAHH!!!!) and his many costumes, ICE, the bounty hunter/caterer, Buster's many dramatic realizations that he is in fact a monster, Motherboy XXX, the return of Liza Minnelli as Lucille 2 (I mean, Lucille Austero), Oscar's hints that he is really Buster's father, Barry Zuckerkorn (Henry Winkler) jumping the...I mean...A shark, the return of Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Maggie Lizer (as in Maggie ""lies her"" ass off), who comes back packing a whole new set of lies for she and Michael to rekindle their built-on-lies relationship with, Stan Sitwell, Sally Sitwell, Tobias signing a release for the family to be featured on a show called ""Scandal Makers,"" which leads to Tobias getting panned by critics for his portrayal of George Sr., Dave Attell getting praised for his daring, cut-off-wearing performance as Tobias, and ARRESTED's narrator pointing out how sad that show's narrator is compared to his own gloriousness, the literal doctor (we lost him, looks dead, all-right), ""Meat the Veals"" (my personal favorite episode of the series), Ben Stiller as Tony Wonder, ""Good Grief,"" the episode that leaves everyone depressed, Maeby's new job, the return of Kitty, Buster's brief affair with Lupe, his mother's housekeeper, which leads Lucille to fire her, Lucille's new maid, Robot, whom Buster also sleeps with (""What did you expect mother? I'm half-machine!""), and of course, Tobias' British nanny alter-ego...Mrs. Featherbottom!!!!

The extras on this set are sparse, which is somewhat of a letdown compared to the first season's set. My favorite extra from last season was all of the original songs by David Shwartz, and I'm pretty sure the music that plays whenever Oscar hints that he is Buster's father is new. The deleted scenes are nice, overall, the blooper real is better than most show's, and the ""Season 1 in 3 Minutes"" feature is nice, albeit running past 3 minutes (it has a 3.12 minute running time). The box layout is...well, it comes with a plastic case around it, and I hate those because they're not sturdy...in fact, I have a small collection of plastic cases that couldn't fit back around the DVDs. Underneath the plastic case however, is a cardboard case that's pretty much designed like the last DVD set but the back cover is just another picture, and the logo on the front is all orange, versus ARRESTED in orange and DEVELOPMENT in black. I like consistency, so I'm slightly peeved by the outside case, but hey, there have been many worse scenarios (my largest sum of rage is directed towards the difference between the PENN & TELLER: BULLSH*T season 1 and 2 sets).

Overall, aside from two, that's it, TWO not-as-good-as-the-others-but-still-brilliant episodes, this is one terrific, excellent, spectacular, hilarious, witty, sly, and down-right great collection. In fact, this, in my opinion, is the single greatest season of any TV show ever.

According to the ratings for season three, they are much better than last year's, so the chance of getting axed I think is not a problem anymore. But that doesn't mean you can't stop telling your friends. Tell your friends, tell your neighbors about Arrested Development. Tell them to buy season one & two to get caught up. This way, the show can move on to syndication on some channel that is known for great comedy like TBS (just a suggestion).

***Regarding the hidden special feature that a reviewer below me could not find. You need to highlight ""The Emmaculate Election"" in the episode listing (as if your going to watch the episode) and left click your dvd remote to get to the special feature. It must be an easter egg or something.***

Anyway, buy this DVD set, you won't regret it!",1129161600,2,988,4.544943820224719
2382555,5,B000A9QKRI,"I love Arrested Development, it's one of the best if not thee best well-written laugh out loud sitcoms to ever come out on tv. I can't stop recommending this,and it figures that something so perfect is so underappreciated, we'll be lucky to get all of the season 3 episodes, but with the fans help maybe we could get more than that, much more. (...)",1129075200,,349,4.46875
2382556,5,B000A9QKRI,"I am a huge TV fan in general. My favorite show of all time (before Arrested Development) was The Simpsons. I thought that I would never see a show that works on as many levels as The Simpsons did. I admire how the show could have such broad comedy and such nuances, often in the same joke. However, as wonderful as The Simpsons was, Arrested Development has eclipsed my wildest imagination of what a comedy could be. I have never seen a TV show be so consistently funny. If one were to compile a list of the 22 greatest episodes of TV ever, I would happily compare them to the 22 episodes of Arrested Development Season One and I would contend that the latter group is better. Furthermore, never has such an amazing group of actors been assembled on one program. Each actor is perfect in his or her role. I was watching a program over the weekend counting down the 100 best TV show characters of all time. If Arrested Development remains on the air for a few more seasons, I predict that the entire Bluth clan will wind up in the top ten. The wonderful performances (including, by the way, narrator Ron Howard) and the incomparable writing have elevated this program to my favorite ever.

That was what I wrote for the first season.  And it's still completely true.  If anything, this second season has further enriched television and is at least as brilliant as the first season.  The way each episode is built upon the past episodes of wonderful.  And lest you think that I haven't seen many comedies that you may have, let me dispel you of that myth.  Some of my other favorite shows include Seinfeld, The Office, Buffy, Angel, Coupling, Friends, Frasier, Futurama, Freaks and Geeks, the Adult Swim shows, South Park, the Practice, and many more.  I have regularly watched many of the comedies that people consider great--The Honeymooners, I Love Lucy, M*A*S*H, Three's Company, The Cosby Show, The Family Guy, etc.  And Arrested Development is considerably more funny than the best of those shows.

As a comedian, I do consider comedy an art form.  I may be in the minority, but I still believe it.  Having said that, each of these episodes, with not one single exception, is a masterpiece.  This is easily the funniest three DVDs you will ever buy (with the possible exceptions of the season 1 DVDs and any other Arrested DVDs that may come out in the future).  This show is funnier and better than any other show or movie or performance I have ever seen.  I have never been as passionate about a piece of pop culture as I am of this marvelous witty show.  Buy this DVD set; you will not be disappointed.",1129075200,4,2610,4.5588865096359745
2382557,5,B000A9QKRI,"I just purchased my season 2 DVD today and, I must say, I am impressed. The packaging and pictures are very nicely done and I love the orange/white/black color scheme. The blooper reel alone makes this DVD a must have, as well as the brilliant episodes.

I suppose a summary of the show is in order: Arrested Development chronicles the everyday lives of the Bluth family. The Bluths used to be rich and snobbish, but, after the patriarch of the family, George Senior, was arrested for using the company as his personal piggy bank (along with some...light treason), they've lost everything. Michael is the lone sane Bluth (for the most part) and he does all he can to keep the failing company afloat and his family members (a terrific ensemble, some of the greatest actors in the business) from tearing each other apart.

In the second season, Michael's about had it with his family and tries to move away from Orange County to Arizona with his son, George Michael. Just as he makes this decision, however, his father breaks out of prison and escapes to Mexico. Michael is now being threatened with arrest for helping his father and must go back to California (and his family) to clear his name.

The great thing about this show is it's continuity. Every episode calls back to a past one in some small way and the tightness of the plot and characters makes it very rewarding to watch. The second season has some of the strongest episodes of the series ('Afternoon Delight' and 'Righteous Brothers' are by far 2 of the funniest shows I have ever seen). I don't see how anyone cannot love this show; the dry comedy, the smart humor, the hilarious characters, the rewarding plotlines, they're all brilliant.

Arrested Development is a one of a kind show. It's a gem, and you shouldn't miss it. If you're thinking about buying this, take the plunge. It's amazing and I guarentee you'll enjoy yourself.",1128988800,5,1896,4.701807228915663

Instead I just want to level to all non-watchers out there, though the intelligent dialogue is always commented on, it must be mentioned that the humor on this show is capable of reaching all senses of humor.  For instance, though I am not particularly a big fan of any other recent sitcoms, I obviously love the show.  My friends, the few I have convinced to watch the show, own the entire Friends series between them, and yet the show still reaches them, though typically on a different level.  Without the vast range of characters and styles of humor on the show I can't imagine anyone, from an intellectual, to those who just love a good fart joke, not falling in love with this show.",1128902400,5,838,4.597315436241611

I could understand that you might never have heard of Arrested Development, or that you live in Amish Country, but if you know the show exists and your too busy watching Dancing with the Stars, f*** you. This is the greatest show in the history of history. Seinfeld can't live up to Arrested Development's feces. It has the greatest writing, acting, directing, cinematography, narration, bad magic, frozen bananas, awkward cousin-on-cousin action, seal incidents, Oedipal attractions, the dude that played Fonzie, the dude that played Opie, the dude that played Teen Wolf Too, and evreything that's good in this world. I beg of you (I'm on my knees), please watch it. Because if you don't and it gets cancelled, I'll hunt down Ryan Seacrest and castrate him. No, that would be doing you a favor. I''ll  get creative. I'll hunt the Fab 5 from Queer Eye and obligate them to have sex with all of the Desperate Housewives. I'll use their vomit to drown the cast of Lost and cut of their arms to beat the cast of The O.C to death. I'll use those young, beautiful, and rich bastards' money to start my own television network dedicated to airing Arretsed Development 24/7.

2382584,5,B000A9QKRI,"Watching Arrested Development on TV is great. Being able to re-watch it over and over again on DVD is even better.

I had never seen an episode of this show until my brother talked me into watching Season 1 which I bought him as a gift knowing he was a big fan.  After a couple of episodes, I was 'hooked', just like Buster's left hand.

That was midway through Season 2, so I had some catching up to do.

I've since seen all of Season 2's episodes more than once, but soon as we were able to pre-order this bad boy, I put my money down for it.

I can't wait for the 11th.

The thing that gets me is -- Why aren't more people watching this show?

Here's a tip if you haven't seen it and want to try and get into it because you keep hearing good things: Rent Season 1 and start at the beginning.

It's not a show like Everybody Loves Raymond or Friends (both great shows) where you can pick up in the middle of 1 episode and everything makes sense to you.

To make this show as thoroughly enjoyable as possible, you need to know more of the back-story of this dysfunctional family.

Start with Season 1, Disc 1 and I don't see how you can possibly be disappointed.

Then watch Season 2 in order and what may have seemed inconsequential early in the season really comes together later on. You'll love it!",1128556800,4,1302,4.188755020080321

2382586,5,B000A9QKRI,"Arrested Development, even if it were to (tragically) end this very day, would still be hailed as a classic sitcom.  It is the new ""Seinfeld"", without-a-doubt.

The show is brilliantly written, with an all-star cast that also includes many big-name guest stars.  Everybody who watches this show falls in love with it.  I heard such good things about the show at first that I bought Season 1 without seeing a single episode, and I in no way regret that decision what-so-ever.  So why not do the same if you havn't checked it out already?",1128470400,5,536,4.659574468085107
2382587,5,B000A9QKRI,"Five stars does not accurately reflect my appreciation for this show.  I had been a fan of David Cross from Mr. Show, so I tuned into this series and was pleased to discover that he is only one of many reasons this show is great.  The entire cast compliments each other to produce the most talented cast of any comedy I have seen.  The first season was amazing and the second season just improved on the groundwork the first season had laid.  Most of the running jokes returned and many new ones were added.  My favorite involved George Michael's girlfriend whom nobody would ever remember her name or even meeting her.  (For example, it said Ann Veal (not pictured) under her yearbook picture!).

I think a large part of the reason it does not have the ratings numbers that it deserves is that it takes a while to get the rythm of the show and to understand the many running jokes that the series depends on.  If someone where to tune in halfway through a random episode, then I could see how the show might not grab them the way it has myself and the other reviewers.  That is why the DVD format is perfect for a show such as this one.  It gives people an opportunity to catch up and appreciate the funniest show on television.  If you own the first season then you don't need me to tell you to get the second.  If you are new to the show, then get the first season and the second.

There have been comedies, but none like this, while it does take a viewing or two to get up to speed on what is going on, this show piles on the laughs one after another. TV latley has been very un-funny, with the notable exception of ""Scrubs"" and the FX channel recent short-run shows ""Starved"" and ""It's Always Sunny in Philly"".

Please watch it on TV so they can continue to make new seasons.  This is history in the making people!  If you want laugh tracks to tell you when to laugh or weak attempts at satire and 'smart' comedy, go watch Yes, Dear or Desperate Housewives or some crap.

2382604,5,B000A9QKRI,"Over the past few years there has been much talk about the supposed death of the sitcom on network television. And if those preparing to mourn the genre consider Friends or its ilk to be the standard-bearer, than perhaps they are right.

But maybe, just maybe, with Arrested Development we are seeing the future of the situation comedy... and if that's the case, things are looking up!

Arrested Development isn't your standard ""set up a punch line, deliver punch-line, listen to the studio audience roar"" show. In fact, rarely is there a set up or punchline, but rather keenly written and expertly delivered dialogue. And rather than the standard ""Joey and Phoebe get stuck in an elevator while Rachel and Monica plan Thanksgiving dinner"" storylines, Arrested lets each episode unfold in an intricate and intriguing manner with humor that ranges from subtle to sublime.

The basic premise? We're spending time with the Bluth family, who, to borrow a phrase, put the ""fun"" in dysfunctional. The characters range from maniacal (especially the Emmy-worthy turn by Jessica Walter as matriarch Lucille Bluth) to misguided (perhaps best exemplified by Will Arnett's desperate-for-attention-at-any-cost Gob). These aren't cookie-cutter cardboard characters as you'll find on other comedies. Each is a fascinating character study, with flaws and faults and quirks unlike those seen in other television households.

Best of all - and perhaps the main reason to purchase the DVD - the show is (gasp) laugh-out-loud funny and will be whether this is the first or one-hundred-and-first time you view the episodes.

Comedy, dead? Not as long as the Bluth family are around!",1126915200,29,1661,5.2293233082706765

Decades from now, our descendents will look back on Arrested Development as our greatest contribution to culture. The pinnacle of comedy is reached with this show - a point which God himself did not think was attainable by man until this show first emerged.

What I will say is that this is a show that is so outside of standard television that I'm suprised that it doesn't have others trying to copy what it has done. Arrested Development makes tv worth watching again, for every bad American remake of a great British classic, or horrible ""original"", using old jokes and older situations, A.D makes up for it, with original humor and wit. You will never know exactly what direction the show will  turn in the next episode, or even in the next two minutes.

A.D. uses what maybe the greatest TV cast since Seinfeld to bring life and caring for the charactures, they are so off the wall that at first it may seem totally unexeptable to ever care for them, but you start to, and that is the shows greatest strenght.

Everyone is aware of the fantastic writing, but another angle of the show is the fact that the actor's grasped their roles from the beginning.  I hate when shows change characters around to match the writing, and luckily this show is consistent where it needs to be and unpredictable when it has to be.
  I am not one of those people who throw ""greatest ever"" around on a daily basis becasue it really bugs me. For example, someone wrote that ""Perfect Strangers"" was the best show ever. Yes, the one with Balki. Look it up.  Anyway, I think season 1 is the best one seasons worth of shows I have ever seen.  Of course, in my opinion, the Simpsons still beat them out in the long run with hundreds of great episodes, and I hope dearly that the writers of A.D. didn't empty their chambers.

2382622,5,B000A9QKRI,"In the second season of the critically acclaimed Arrested Development, the show continues to display the clever wit, stellar acting, and overall insanity that won multiple Emmys, including the award for Outstanding Comedy Series, in the first season. The show is set in Orange County, California, and follows the exploits of the Bluth family. While they were once one of the richest families in the country, they lost nearly everything when George Bluth, Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) was arrested for white collar crime. However, at the end of last year, it was revealed that he had also committed ""light treason"" by building houses in Iraq for Saddam Hussein. George's son Michael (Jason Bateman), who is basically the only sane member of the Bluth family, was forced to take over, while the rest of his clueless family continued buying, mooching, and acting as if nothing had happened.
The year starts off as Michael and his son George Michael (Michael Cera) are driving to Arizona in order to once and for all escape the greed and corruption of their family life. However, Michael soon learns that, since his father had escaped after faking a heart attack, he is next in line to be prosecuted. His family posts bail, so while Michael is allowed to go to work, live at home, and for the most part live his life, he is banned from leaving the state, forcing him to once again help out his family. With Michael under investigation, his older brother GOB (Will Arnett), short for George Oscar Bluth, Jr., becomes the new president of the Bluth corporation, while Michael secretly pulls the strings. This of course leads to many catastrophes due to GOB's greed, arrogance, and overall incompetance (remember, GOB is one of the world's worst magicians, yet he believes himself to be the next Copperfield).
Meanwhile at home, Michael's mother Lucille (Jessica Walter) restarts an old affair with George's twin brother Oscar Bluth (also played by Tambor), and she sends poor Annyong (Justin Lee), her adopted Korean son, away to the Milford Boarding School. Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) and Tobias (David Cross) decide to try an open marriage in an attempt to save their marriage. At the same time, Tobias decides to try out for the Blue Man Group (the stage show, not the depression focus group). And Maeby (Alia Shawkat) becomes jealous that George Michael is spending most of his time with his new (and very religious) girlfriend, Ann Veal (now played by Mae Whitman). Lucille is confronted by a Michael Moore lookalike, she enlists Buster (Tony Hale) in the army, unaware that there is a war going on in the Middle East.  Finally, Ron Howard is absolutely brilliant as the show's narrator. He often fills us in on references made by the family members, and he even picks on a few characters.
Early on, George, Sr. returns home, and spends most of the season hiding out in the attic of the model home, with Michael as his confidante. He observes many of the going-ons around the house, many of which go way beyond bizarre. The stories this year involve Buster going AWOL from the army in order to play the crane game at a small carnival, GOB playing AGAINST the Bluth company in a corporate softball game against a rival developping company, Ann getting left in Mexico by Michael, and a dishonest campaign to try to get George Michael elected to Student Body President.
The single-episode stories are all hilarious (I can't think of a single bad episode), but it's the multi-episode story arcs that make me laugh the hardest. Buster's army training is hilarious to watch, seeing as how he is a mama's boy who is prone to panic attacks, and it gets even better when he tries to put his training to use. GOB's puppet Franklin is utilized incredibly well, especially when he tries to make a CD of his act called ""Franklin Comes Alive"". When Maeby conned her way into an executive position at a movie studio, the results were all hilarious, and Michael's undying dislike of Ann, as well as his inability to remember her name or what she looks like were great. Unlike most comedy shows, Arrested Development is fairly serialized, and it foreshadows many of its plots and jokes (pay extra attention when, in an early episode, Buster says, ""I never thought that I'd miss a hand so much,"" when he refers to an old hand-shaped chair).
The season is consistently funny; I can't remember a single dull episode. In fact, the quality of the jokes increase as the season goes on, leading to the season finale, which actually had me falling out of my seat, because I was laughing so hard. Make no mistake, the early episodes are great and will make you laugh out loud (the second one features what I believe to be the greatest game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in history), but as the story develops, and there are more and more things to reference and build upon, things just explode at the end.
While the main cast are all hilarious and extremely talented, the weekly guest stars should not be overlooked. The family attorney, Barry Zuckercorn (Henry Winkler), returns and is more incompetant than ever. George, Sr's old secretary Kitty Sanchez (Judy Greer) makes a welcome return and is involved in a few very unexpected plot twists. Also, a few other great side characters return from Season 1, including Liza Minelli as Lucille 2 and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the dishonest attorney Maggie Lizer. But this year, we are introduced to a bunch of new and very hilarious characters. Gene Parmesan (Martin Mull) is a private investigator who is terrible with disguises, but he is always able to fool Lucille. Tony Wonder (Ben Stiller) plays one of GOB's rival magicians, while Stiller's wife Christine Taylor plays Sally Sitwell, one of Michael's old flames. We are also treated to Zach Braff, Alan Tudyk, Iona Skye, Dave Attel, Tom Jane, and Martin Short.
Sadly for the show, the ratings are not very high. Despite a rabid fanbase and nearly unaminous critical acclaim, Arrested Development is struggling (the fact that it is extremely self-referential may be a factor, and I advise everyone to see Season 1 before this, or at least a quarter of the jokes will go over your head). In fact, there are only 18 episodes this year because the network wasn't sure if it was worth keeping this show on. However, even in the face of adversity, the show was still able to joke about its predicament. At one point, Michael is shocked to learn that a customer had reduced his order from 22 to 18 houses, and in real life, FOX cut the episode order from 22 to 18. Also, a popular website was plauged by Family Guy pop-up ads (another reason the show was cut short was to get Family Guy and American Dad on quicker). Also, the show gets in a great jab at its more popular competitor Desperate Housewives.
I guess the one gripe that I have with this set is the fact that the episodes are in broadcast order as opposed to production order.  Seeing as how the show is very serialized for a comedy, episode order matters more than it would on a show like The Simpsons.  The good thing is that only one episode was aired out of order, and that is The Sword of Destiny.  It is supposed to be the second to last episode (right before Righteous Brothers), but instead, it comes a few episodes early.  While continuity isn't messed up too terribly, there are a few things that someone wouldn't understand if they didn't know about the order problem.  For example, something that happens at the very end of SoD (in the ""On the Next Arrested Development"" segment) isn't ""fixed"" until Righteous Brothers, which makes sense since RB should have been the next episode (hint: look for the band-aids on GOB's fingers).  But, if that is the worst problem, then things aren't so bad.
Fortunately, the FOX executives are smart enough to realize that this is an amazing show that will win them plenty of awards, and they decided to give it a third season even though its numbers continued to be poor throughout two seasons (the fact that Arrested Development won USA Today's Save Our Show poll and came in second in the E! poll probably helped a lot).
This is a collection that no Arrested Development fan should be without. And if you're not a fan, definitely start watching. No other show on television is this funny, clever, or just plain fun. Do yourself a favor and get arrested.",1124409600,23,8318,4.7245179063360885

2382645,5,B000A9QKRI,"""Arrested Development"" is probably the best new series of the last few years. The show, along with other Laugh-Track Free shows like ""Scrubs"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", reinvented the sitcom world after many believed the death of ""Seinfeld"" meant the death of sitcoms.

In it's second year, the show doesn't disappoint, and IMHO it gets better. I found myself caring for characters I didn't really was fond of in the first season, like Buster. And my love for already-favorite characters like GOB and Tobias continued to shine.

Aside from the gut-busting and side-splitting aspects of this magnificent series, the thing I found to be most unique about this show is it's great continuity, along with foreshadowing. What other sitcom foreshadows events that will occur 10 episodes later? In an age where even serialized drama shows like ""24"" don't plan ahead, it's refreshing to see a comedy show that also has a great thought-out plot. This is all credited to Mitch Hurwitz, the creator and show-runner, whose attention to detail is extraordinary.

The continuity and call-backs to previous episodes are extremely rewarding to fans, but after watching the Season 2 episodes I could understand why the show may be hard to follow if you didn't watch the first season. That's why this DVD will be great aside the Season 1 set.

Fox atypically renewed the show despite the not-so-great ratings, so I hope the show will find its viewers next season like other classics found theirs in their third year. If it won't, the sitcom world would find itself in an arrested development of it's own.",1123372800,16,1586,4.973584905660378

We taped each season II show, but can't wait for the release of Season II on DVD. It's just that much better than taping it from TV. I have already ordered the season II and can't wait until October 11 for the release date.

FYI... Did you know that AD has 11 Emmy nominations this year!?!?!? The show is just that good.

2382648,5,B000A9QKRI,"Arrested Development is currently the best show on television.  Every aspect of this show is top notch.  Great humor, great writing and great acting.  Perhaps what makes this show so great is that there are so many layers to the storylines and jokes, that you could literally watch an episode five times and still find something you hadn't noticed in the previous viewing(s). This ain't your traditional sitcom...

That said, Season 2 begins where season one left off (obviously...), with Bluth Family patriarch George Sr. having escaped from prison. The family has no idea where he is and son Michael (the ""sane"" one) is once again determined to leave his family and start over with his son George Michael.  He is prevented from doing so, not only by his family, but by the police.  From there, the Bluth's build a second model home, hire a bounty hunter to find George Sr., have an office holiday party turn a bit incestuous, play softball against a rival construction company, one family member loses a limb, they crash a mother-son dance, George Michael runs for student body President and engages in a smear campaign thanks to his Uncle Gob, Michael and Gob try to recover documents that may clear George Sr's name, and George Sr turns himself in to the police...(or does he?)

Again, this is great programming on Fox's part.  Buy the DVD's, keep the Bluth's on the air!",1122508800,12,1375,4.772151898734177
2382649,5,B000A9QKRI,"Seven days before my birthday, the second season of the best show on television is arriving.  This show, this masterful show is with certainty, the most brilliant, most watchable, and most satirically on cue, a hundred and ten percent of the time.

Television as a device, as well as a faucet to drain the mind has never had to deal with something so groundbreaking, so...aware of itself and the ironies that it perpetuates (At least on Network TV, the BBC and HBO are about on the same level in terms of craftmanship that goes into Arrested itself).  Even a classic show like Seinfeld is still a Sitcom of that same three-camera mold, even if the content was different.  This show never plays dumb with the audience, it is always aware that is is ""just a show,"" as much as the characters are not aware of such.

Watching the short documentary, ""The Breakthrough Season"" on the Seinfeld Season Four DVD, they talk about how the show was brilliant and very popular with a small group of people, then exploding like it did.  In the show, they began parodying its own actual creation.  The show proved to the audience, growing rapidly, that Seinfeld was not just about such tedium as co-male airport transportation and the phantom parking space.  This proved there was the glimmer of hope for network television, because it was not trying to escape its own foundations, not trying to pry the viewer from the gravity of reality.

If this move in Seinfeld was such a glimmer of hope, Arrested Development gives us the horizon, a full-bodied, articulate, rich, insightful, but even moreso skewering, farcical, satiric, perfect.  The second season, at...uhh...first glance, might have seemed inferior to the first season, but watching them the second...third...so on...proves that this is the most excellent show, and the second season is the best tag to the first in the style of Godfather Part II or Empire Strikes Back to their respective bretheren.

The episodes of this second season are of quality difficult to fathom.  The first episode sets the viewer right back into the current swing of the family.  Michael Bluth (played to the marrow by Jason Bateman, giving a Cary Grant dominance of this show a Keatonesque flair of comedic rhythm and gusto under the short hair of a man wondering how normal slipped out and when the began their collective occupation of insanity), the leading character in the series is finally leaving the family, only to return when they refuse (unknowingly) to acknowledge his absence.  Of course, George, the Patriarch of the family is currently on the lam from his ""light"" treason charge.  The chain of events is set in motion, and the show follows through as a winner.

In this season, the viewer will soon learn why Steve Holt is a Bastard; why Annhog is under the impression that Michael gave her and his son/her boyfriend permission to do it; why GOB borrows ten thousand dollars to fund an album of him singing to his hand (and not in a mutual fund); why the Business Model is a person, not an plan, and why she has rabies; why Frank Wrench is carrying off Lindsey, in fur and tranquilized; why Lucille crashes into the giant Banana, full of ""Afternoon Delight;"" Why Tobias should record himself for a day; why Buster and the seals, loose or otherwise keep confronting him; why Maeby is chasing after an idiot demographic; why Tony Wonder (A deadpan Ben Stiller playing the role) is Using his Allusion, despite the pop-up ads; why the narrator (Exec. Producer Ron Howard in...like...his fifth Television Show Role) knows better than any network ""Desperate"" for ratings, how to narrate a show; and especially why Oscar being unfairly equated with his hairless counterpart.

Buy the DVD, but even moreso, the show just edged into its third season, fortunately for us all Fox is keeping it alive, and placing alot of stock in the success of such.  Now go out and watch it.  The fanbase for the show is the most rabid, simply because the fans know what this show is, and how good it is.  All we fans need are a million more people watching; the Emmy Board is, with Eleven nods for this season.  Now with a second DVD set, the perfect show is all the more accessable, and can only survive.  And now, altogether: ""You know it's true...everything I do, I do it for you...Michael!""",1122249600,14,4307,4.760752688172043
2382650,5,B000A9QKRI,"Normally I hate it when people (including myself) write reviews for DVDs that haven't even come out yet. But I'm so excited for the 2nd season of Arrested Development to come out on DVD that I'm going to write one anyway! (Don't worry, I'll come back and update the review once I actually get the DVD.)

This is, in my opinion, the funniest show on television. My favorite thing about this show is how it is a ""comedy for smart people."" If you like dumb and ""easy"" humor, then there is probably still some stuff in here that you'll enjoy... BUT if you like clever/witty humor, you'll LOVE this show. The more you watch it, the more jokes you'll understand and the more funny the jokes will be. There are even jokes foreshadowing other jokes several episodes down the road (e.g. Buster's ""I never thought I'd miss a hand so much"" when looking at his old hand chair in ""Amigos""). There's no way you could ever catch everything on your first viewing, and that's why the DVDs are so great.

While the 1st season is incredible, I'd have to say that the 2nd season might be even better. The jokes just keep building (so it's even funnier if you've seen the 1st season). The running storyline of Tobias as an ""on call"" understudy of the blue man group is great... even at the end of the season (well after that story has ended) you can still see blue smudges on everything in the house. The whole thing about Buster losing his hand is hilarious and contributes greatly to my favorite episode of the season, ""Motherboy XXX"" (which has one of the funniest endings I've ever seen). I could go on and on: the Veals, Gene Parmesan, Mrs. Featherbottom, GOB's wife, Maeby's job, ""Scandalmakers""... it just never stops!

FOX cut back this season's original order of 22 episodes to only 18 (allegedly so they could introduce ""American Dad""...  but there are even jokes about the cut, like when the Bluth Company's order for homes is cut from 22 to 18). While it's disappointing to think we could have had four more episodes, I'm more than willing to trade those four episodes for a whole 3rd season. This is the funniest show on TV!",1122249600,245,2116,4.531413612565445

Unlike Seinfeld it didn't take four seasons to hit it's mark, it found it early on and kept hitting it for two very strong seasons.  I certainly hope this is only the beginning and we will be comparing it to some of TV's all time best down the road.  If you haven't seen every episode you owe it to yourself to buy both sets and just enjoy.  The shows have so much material it takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate and you'll find yourself laughing at different jokes each time you rewatch the same show.  As I wait in anticipation of what they are going to do with season three, I hope they throw in some good extras on this set, although the shows alone are enough to get my hard earned cash.",1122076800,9,765,4.284722222222222
