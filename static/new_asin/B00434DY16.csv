It hasn't left my mind since and I've been searching high and low for a place to watch it. I find it's highly underappreciated and impossible to find on the internet, save for a couple obscurely hidden clips on Youtube. But luckily Movie Mars was selling copies of the DVD, which I happily pounced on. And as an added bonus, I got Momo alla conquista del tempo, a movie I've never seen before! I have yet to watch it but I'm excited to see another Italian animated movie!

Unfortunately the version of the DVD I've gotten does not have the English audio, only Italian. This obviously isn't a bad thing as this movie was made in Italy and came from there but all other DVD versions I've seen came with English audio. It might just be that this is one of the most recent printings of this movie and they've decided to stop adding the English dub to save money. It's difficult to say... And if you're looking for special features, you won't find any on this copy (or at least copies from Movie Mars) as there are only two options: ""Play Movie"" and ""Scene Select"". This is unfortunate, as I would have loved to have known more about the development of this movie, as well as hearing the high quality English dub I remember from my childhood.

Maybe someday I'll find a DVD with the dub or just the audio to put over my DVD, but for now I'm happy to have at least gotten to watch the movie all the way through, even if I didn't understand what the characters were saying most of the time.

I give this a 4 outta 5 stars because the movies themselves are great! I'm only knocking off a star because of my disappointment in the copy I received.",1470009600,,1786,4.325373134328358
8414112,1,B00434DY16,"I remember watching them as a kid, but they had an English audio track in the movies and hoping that this would have them as well. When I played the movie in my region free blu-ray player, the movies didn't have subtitles or an audio track listed as an option. ONLY ITALIAN. Just be aware of this before making a purchase. I was unfortunate to have to discover this myself and disappointed that I can't watch this movie in English.... Still searching for an English version of these movies...",1454630400,2,492,4.53932584269663
