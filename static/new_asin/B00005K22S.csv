7942766,5,B00005K22S,"funny little independent, with Howard Stern, the voice of Jackie ""The Joke Man"" Martling, and Bob Nelson as Eppy Epperman, one of his stand up comedy characters. Worth a look for the Howard Stern scenes.",1503964800,,203,4.828571428571428

7942769,2,B00005K22S,"How this waste of time and talent survived long enough to get released on DVD is a complete mystery to me.  Enjoyed Bob Nelson in ""BRain Donors"", but this was poorly conceived, poorly written, poorly directed, and woodenly acted.  Yikes!",1435104000,,237,4.9
