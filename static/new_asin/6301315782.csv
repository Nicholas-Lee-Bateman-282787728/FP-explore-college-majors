8157949,5,6301315782,It was a good homey movie.  I've seen this movie at lest 5 times.  Like it every time.  I went through this process twice in my life.  Two dear wives died very suddenly.  It was a tough transition going from married man to widower.  I watch it at least once a year.,1481068800,,265,4.0

I think John Ritter at his best and Sharon Gless outstanding too.",1317600000,,127,5.0476190476190474
8157951,5,6301315782,"I adore this movie, it is funny, sad, and romantic and shows how even the worst of situations can turn out great.

Unfortunately I only have the movie taped off the TV and would love to own an original copy. But I live in New Zealand and these sorts of stories are not available in this country. If you manage to get the opportunity of seeing this movie go for it you will love it. The late John Ritter and Sharon are great together.",1099008000,,433,4.154761904761905
