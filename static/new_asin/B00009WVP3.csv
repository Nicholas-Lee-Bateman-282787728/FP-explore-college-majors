7993741,4,B00009WVP3,"My overall thoughts about this documentary is that it is worth watching and will be enjoyable to any snake enthusiast. It is not, however, better than other snake documentaries such as ""Snakes and Crocodiles"" or ""Reptiles"" from the Nature series.  Rob obviously has a passion for snakes and is excellent with them.  The snakes covered in this video are mostly Australian and are covered in pretty good detail.  Rob is not the best in front of the camera but does deliver all in all.  What makes up for this is that Dr. Bryan Fry is also in the documentary.  Dr. Fry may as well come out with his own documentary series about the evolution and natural history of snakes and snake venom, and the hell with anything else.  I contemplated giving it 5 stars just for his appearance, but to be honest it really gets just the 4 because it is a little cheesy at times and does not quite live up to other documentaries of its kind.  It's only 45 min. and doesn't really give you too much ""new"" information if you are pretty familiar with the basic info. on australian species such as taipans, eastern browns, and tiger snakes (etc).  All said and done, I would recomend this documentary for anyone who enjoys this subject matter, or if not for anything else, because any message discussing snakes from a positive perspective makes it worth all the while.",1153958400,14,1345,4.598326359832636
