641930,4,6303419763,"""Woman's World"" is a fun and likable comedy with a first-rate cast, and it deserves to be put out on dvd.  It also has funny and pointed dialogue, probably from Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse, the celebrated playwriting team who wrote ""Life with Father"" among other hits, and who have an ""additional dialogue by"" credit on the film.

Clifton Webb brings 3 married couples to New York City to decide who should take over a major job in his auto factory.  Cornel Wilde is the good guy with the square, awkward wife June Allyson.  Fred MacMurray is the troubled one with an ulcer, and Lauren Bacall is his wised-up wife, agreeing to pretend she's not about to divorce him.

Van Heflin is the ""still waters run deep"" candidate with the gorgeous wife Arlene Dahl (with a Texas accent?), who sends out hilariously over-the-top sexual vibes to everyone including Clifton Webb.  (Doesn't she know he's probably not interested?  Of course, this is the 50s.)  Miss Dahl is both charismatic and funny in this film.

The six actors playing the husbands and wives are all fun to watch.  MacMurray and Bacall have the meatiest material, since they're dealing with a genuine problem marriage.  I love their introductory scene, driving through the Lincoln Tunnel.  As they're about to get out of the tunnel after a bitter exchange, he says ""looks there's the light,"" and she says dryly, ""I saw the light a long time ago"" in her best Bacall drawl.

A fun side story has Bacall's character generously taking Allyson under her wing, since Allyson's character seems incapable of dressing herself or choosing an appropriate wardrobe.  (Having blown her budget on a gruesome barbecue ""chef"" outfit for the whole family back home, very 50s.)  Bacall, always playing someone savvy, takes her to a bargain basement kind of place that carries dicarded originals, and the scene of pandemonium of women ransacking the disorganized racks of sale price clothing is hilarious.

Anyway, it's an entertaining movie, and a fun capsule of 50s America, with good location shots of New York City.  Doesn't deserve to disappear.",1207353600,15,2093,4.934285714285714
641931,5,6303419763,"This has been one of my favorite movies since I was a little girl.  It's lighthearted and fun.  It has an all star cast that includes June Allyson, Lauren Bacall, and Fred MacMurray. The story is also very good.  June Allyson is so funny.  This is really a great classic that should be released on dvd.",1178582400,5,302,4.339285714285714
641932,4,6303419763,"Three men are up for a major promotion in a car company and the man in charge (Clifton Webb) decides that each are fit for the job. He plans to make his decision based on the men's wives, and each are very different from each other. The problem is that not everyone wants the job. Bill (Cornel Wilde) and Katie (June Allyson) care about each other too much to sacrifice seeing each other often. Sid (Fred MacMurray) and Elizabeth(Lauren Bacall) bicker constantly, but Liz wants her husband to worry about his health rather than the satisfaction of a prestigious job. Jerry (Van Helfin) and Carol (Arlene Dahl) seem to want the job too much, which is obvious by Carol's constant advances toward the boss.

Woman's World is fun to watch because of the characters. Not much happens as far as plot goes; it is basically the same the whole time. The character interactions are the most interesting and the most interesting of them are Allyson and Bacall. Their friendship together comes off as sweet and genuine and on their own they are highly respectable but different women.

It is a shame that the film was cut so badly for the VHS release. The opening credits announce Cinemascope quite proudly with a widescreen format. However, the film itself is presented as a full screen film, leaving off about half on the sides. This is quite noticeable in several scenes when key actors are only seen by their hand or their pant legs. As this film relies so heavily on the characters, in widescreen it might be even more enjoyable because it would be possible to study the reactions of the more quiet characters.",1150243200,7,1603,4.680851063829787

641936,4,6303419763,"...you'll probably like ""A Woman's World"", because it is similar to those two movies.
Like ""Three Coins in the Fountain"", we have three sets of romances, although this time the folks are all already married: Lauren Bacall and Fred MacMurray, Van Heflin and Arlene Dahl, June Allyson and Cornel Wilde. All three men have been invited out to New York to be scrutinized by Clifton Webb, who is going to promote one of these guys to the Number Two position at the auto company he runs. Along the way, folks fall in and out of love all over again while trying to figure out whether or not they really want this job in exciting New York after all. It would mean changes to your life, you know!
Like ""A Letter to Three Wives"", we have a suspenseful climax: Who is going to get the big job after all? And the movie has a twist to the ending, just like ""Three Wives"". Unlike ""Three Wives"", we get to see about an equal amount of each couple, so we can get to like/dislike either or both partners. In ""Three Wives"", the husband of Jeanne Crain is not in it enough to make an impression.
Of course, seeing my fav, Clifton Webb, is always a joy, though I wish he could have been in even more of the movie! The Bacall/MacMurray sequences are the best, as is the storyline of that bit; I found June Allyson's character overdone. Still and all, a good entrant to the Lush Life movie set.

Lauren Bacall is at her best sparring with  workaholic husband Fred MacMurray and the calculating competitor Arlene  Dahl. June Allyson and Cornel Wilde shine as the midwest couple a bit out  of step with New York society. The plot may seem a bit dated when  contrasted with the current state of business politics.

641986,5,6303419763,"Womans World focuses on Ernest Gifford (Clifton Webb), chairman of a large automobile company, who has to fill the position of general manager and believes that an executives wife is crucial to her husbands success. Three couples  Jerry and Carol (Van Heflin, Arlene Dahl), Sid and Elizabeth (Fred McMurray, Lauren Bacall), and Bill and Katie (Cornel Wilde, June Allyson)  are brought to New York so Gifford can size them up and decide who is the best fit for the job.

The film explores each of the three couples, with particular focus on the wives. Each couple has its own problems, and each of the husbands has admirable qualities and negative aspects. Gifford, like God, sits in judgment as he watches their interaction and gets to know the wives.

Twentieth Century-Fox production head Darryl F. Zanuck hired Jean Negulesco to direct the CinemaScope film after he had recently directed two very popular pictures for the studio  How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) and Thee Coins in the Fountain (1954)  and approved the highest budget ever for a Twentieth Century-Fox modern drama.

The film is very much a product of its era. The script makes clear how a familys income and social life are directly dependent on the husbands employment. One couples marriage has suffered because of the amount of time he spends at work. Another is simply unsuited for the demands of the job. The third is dominated by a woman who will push boundaries to put her husband in an advantageous position.

The main reason why I really liked this movie is because you see a number of excellent Ford Motor Company 'Dream' cars !,  models they never actually made for sale.  I was an Automotive Designer in the Styling Studio of Ford Motor Company in England from 1960 to 1980 so this movie has a special interest for me,

However,  nothing infuriates me more when buying the DVD of a 'CinemaScope' movie to find the widescreen format has been altered.  CinemaScope and all very wide screen movies were the movie industries finest achievement and with today's wider and very large TV screens I don't understand why they destroy these movies.

642016,5,6303419763,"This is a very interesting presentation of the 1950's management class in the ford motor company as the retiring General Manager, Mr. Gifford, seeks his replacement.  He has three men in mind from different parts of the country who have been area sales managers and are reaching that certain age of do or die.

As one older woman says, ""all men reach that age"" in referring to their lack of sexual drive ... But also their ambition for power later in life and that mad dash to grab the biggest of the brass rings, the top position at Gifford Motor Cars (using the offices of Ford Motors in New York),

Mr. Gifford knows that a man's character is revealed in his relationships, so he invites These three candidates to come with their wives so that he can observe them in action at his Long Island country estate.  The three women are played as 1. Eager to please and not too savvy Midwesterner June Allyson, focused on her kids and in love still with hubby; 2. Lauren Bacall as an unhappy big city cool character who wants to divorce Fred MacMurray, who has worked his way up the ranks from the assembly line and doesn't care so much for Family life, and Finally 3, a luscious buxom sexpot from Texas who tries using her sex appeal to get to the big boss when her husband is not ambitious enough.

You will find it an absorbing plot with plenty to look at: handsome characters, beautiful clothes on the women, lovely hotel rooms and restaurants and street scenes and cars and a boat ride on the Hudson, skyscrapers seen from a deluxe convertible's vantage point, a madcap bargain basement department store scene of battling women in slips stealing each other's precious finds of designer dresses, an unctuous Italian waiter, and a surprise twist at the end of the final choice.

What one could conclude perhaps is that the man who wins is he who rejects his wife, with whom he had no kids anyway, and so he can devote himself full time to the overwhelming task.  Somehow the self centered now discarded wife is seen as the problem and thr handicapp.  But once he dumps her, then he is perfect.

That only says that either the job is ridiculously overloaded with time demands or that women can only be of interest in this man's world if they have children, not for themselves alone.

Actually the surprise twist at the end is an interesting philosophical question about amrican and modern Western living.  What is the role of the women, only childbearing to make the man want to work for the women?  Perhaps so!  None of these women work but Lauren Bacall reveals that she was once a dress fitter.",1453334400,,2595,4.554838709677419
642017,5,6303419763,"I didn't know anything about this movie when I began watching and for some reason expected that it would be boring. It wasn't. To my surprise, it quickly drew me in.

The premise is simple. Clifton Webb, the president of a big automotive company, brings 3 top men from branches around the country to NYC to interview (and compete) for a top management job. He wants to get to know them, interact with them, discover their character and talents. With this goal, he has them also bring their wives. We see them arriving and realize each of these couples has issues.  As Clifton Webb sums it up after a couple of days, ""Right man, wrong wife. Right wife? Wrong man."" His wife and (adult) son also get involved in social situations that will help him observe and select a couple.
\
Each couple brings significant star power to add to Webb's:dilemma.  June Alysson and Cornell Wilde are from Middle America--wholesome, honest, in love, happy in their city with their three children. But she doesn't want to live in New York--and keeps putting her foot in it as she interacts with the sophisticated Webb. And Wilde shows himself to Webb as a very honest man--perhaps ""honest to a fault"" for the boss.

Arlene Dahl and Van Heflin are a couple with marital tensions. He's a smart interesting guy --describes the kind of leader to Webb that he thinks he wants and then tells him he's not sure how he measures up himself. Meanwhile, his wife, a glamorous social climbe r and flirt, wants to move to NewYork and is willing to flirt with Webb in the hope of landing the promotion for him.

Fred McMurray and Lauren Bacall  are the third couple and their marriage is in bad shape. He's become a workaholic--with an ulcer--and she feels neglected and resentful. McMurray is the boring, safe choice for the job, a man who doesn't say much but knows how to tell Webb what he wants to hear.

It's interesting to see the way Webb invites them to situations and observes them. The script is sharp and it isn't long before you start to care about these couples, root for one or the other of them and really become curious which it will be. The interactions between the men are well developed, very believable and the women's stories get interesting, too. It's filmed in a lighthearted way, but has some interesting ithoughts about what we really value.",1453248000,,2332,4.618357487922705

I also took note of the style of management of the late manager, finding out the interests of those he interacted with to create a common ground.

AMAZON, I hope you are reading this review as well as dozens of other reviews that ""hammered"" the washed out color picture quality, picture size viewing problems, etc. of this DVD!

* Attention AMAZON Instant Video - You can fix the picture quality. You did with FAIR WIND TO JAVA.
Get ahold of WOMAN'S WORLD, clean it up and make it available for your Prime Members. After all, you are in the movie business now. In a big way I might add! As I pointed out, AMAZON Instant Video did an excellent job of restoring the 1953 action adventure FAIR WIND TO JAVA, which starred Fred MacMurray and Vera Ralston. Watch it right now on Amazon Instant Video. It wasn't originally filmed in Cinemascope, so you get 4:3. It has a HD type picture quality, plus good sound. It is clinic on how to restore a vintage Technicolor Movie! I reviewed it on AMAZON back in April of 2013. AMAZON Instant Video has done great restorations with many other movies from the 1940's and 1950's. Check them out.

* The Video Transfer - of WOMAN'S WORLD is just dreadful! A MINUS 5 STARS if that was possible!
As mentioned before, an embarrassing transfer to DVD by 20th Century FOX CINEMA ARCHIVES. Absolutely no effort was put into quality. A 4:3 Letterbox transfer? What were they thinking? Fortunately, I was able to adjust the screen to a typical Letterbox view by using first the Widescreen prompt, then the Zoom prompt on my LED TV. Worked out fine. You get the Widescreen/Cinemascope effect. At least it can be watched in Widescreen/Cinemascope.

The long out of print VHS version is a mess too. You can still find it on Amazon, but don't bother. The picture is chopped up and blurry. No Widescreen/Cinemascope effect. At least you can tweak the DVD to get the effect. No such luck with the VHS tape.

MOVIE REVIEW

* The Movie - WOMAN'S WORLD itself is 5 STARS PLUS!!
I can recommend it despite the DVD transfer being botched up. My 3 STARS rating is obviously for the picture quality, not the movie. Make the screen adjustments I outlined previously and put up with the inferior picture. I still enjoyed it and think you will.

WOMAN'S WORLD is supported by an all-star cast. Lauren Bacall was never prettier and Clifton Webb was perfect in his role. Fred MacMurray, Van Heflin, Cornel Wilde, June Allyson and Arlene Dahl were all great. Margalo Gillmore, who plays Webb's sister in-law, gives a fine performance too. As does Elliot Reid who plays his nephew. The iconic New York City skyline serves as a back drop to the movie and is quite atmospheric.

An interesting story about how getting to the top (in this case the #2 position) in the corporate world is not as glamorous as you might think. It can take both a physical and emotional toll on those going after the big prize. Their loved ones too. Each person has his or her own personality. Each entirely different from the other. The three men (MacMurray, Heflin and Wilde) Webb brings to New York are well qualified. The challenge for him is to select the best one to be his #2 person. We are shown how the decision making process can sometimes be complicated, taking many twists and turns along the way. Everything can change in an instant. Like it does here. The wives (Bacall, Dahl and Allyson)are equally important in the process. I suppose the title of the movie kind of gives that one away, doesn't it? WOMAN'S WORLD will hold your interest from beginning to end. If you like movies from this era, don't miss it.",1423180800,7,3595,4.5800933125972

But Fox Cinema Achives made to order DVD (similar to Warner Archives products) is very subpar. Anyone who purchases it is being ripped off (I watched a copy from my public library).

The film is presented in a shrunken letterbox format with wide black areas around the borders; the sort of thing they sometimes used to do when formatting widescreen movies for square TV screens. In fact the video transfer they used was obviously done decades ago. The film looks grainy, colors washed out, and it's not presented in the full Cinemascope aspect ratio, so sides of what picture is shown are cropped. Given what many films of the same era look like when the DVD company spends even a moderate amount of money to do an up to date video transfer (I'm not even talking about a restoration here) this is not acceptable.

This is the first Fox Cinema Archives DVD I've seen; if this is typical of the product they put out, I'd pass up all of their products.",1420243200,,1145,4.658415841584159

What more can you want?  Clifton Webb as the erudite President and owner of a privately-held auto manufacturer in the days of inexpensive gasoline, when men worked, women entertained, and everyone had Martinis before dinner.

This film is worth the time, if only for the scene of June Allyson on the boat while cruising upriver to Clifton Webb's country ""home"" -- (mansion, of course).

Well written, well acted, sophisticated AND tons of fun .  Add a nice little travelogue of New York from back in the day, and it is definitely worth the time to watch.",1410912000,,733,4.879032258064516
642173,3,6303419763,"Great Movie! Lousy Transfer to DVD!

This is a review of the DVD version of WOMAN's WORLD. This Movie deserves 5 stars and I would have given it 5 stars if it had been enhanced for DVD. It has not been cleaned up in any way, shape or form. The VHS I bought used a few years back looks easily as good as this DVD. That's why I am only giing this 3 stars. At $20.00 or so, Fox is not doing you any favors. The Images are often muddy and colors bleed. They have some nerve!

The movie itself is a trip back in time. An Automotive Titan named Gifford (Clifton Webb), patterned after one of the Fords has just lost his right hand man and General Manager to a heart attack. Mr. Gifford has invited three candidates for the now open job of General Manager in New York. (How long has it been since they made cars in New York?). They are there to be scrutinized by Mr. Gifford during an all-expenses paid top drawer weekend.

The couples are played by Cornel Wilde and June Allyson, Fred MacMurray and Lauren Bacall, Van Heflin and Arlene Dahl.

A the time this movie was made, June Allyson was the go-to girl for playing All-American houswives. Cute and petite, June was anything but average. She was more like an idealized version of the American Housewife. She doesn't really want this new job for her husband but has decided to make the best of it. Unfortunately, she's a klutz, forever sticking her foot in her mouth or spilling someting on her clothes. We loved her.

Fred MacMurray is a driven man who has climbed the ladder to success with brains, elbow grease, and the midnight oil. His marriage to the elegant Lauren Bacall is strained to the breaking point. She loves him but cannot watch him kill  himself any longer.

Flame-haired beauty Arlene Dahl is a scheming ambitious flirt in love with New York and intent on securing this job for her husband, Van Heflin.

There's lots of footage on New York in the 1950's, the women are beautifully gowned and coiffured and the sets are lush and splendid. No. I won't tell you how it al plays out. You will even hear the Four Aces sing the theme song. As much as I like this movie, I can't recommend that you purchase it because of the poor transfer. Rent it instead.

P.S,.The automobiles, concept cars, Style studios and other automotive acoutrements (did I misspelll that?) are all courtesy of Ford. Look for a cameo by Elinor Donahue in a Bargain Basement fitting room.",1408924800,6,2419,4.45475113122172
642174,5,6303419763,"This is a very enjoyable movie, an engaging story of three men competing for a top job at an auto company and their wives' strong influence on their chances.  All set in the heart of 1950s New York, with a great cast featuring Clifton Webb, Fred MacMurray, Lauren Bacall, June Allyson, Van Heflin, Cornell Wilde, and Arlene Dahl.

So what's wrong with the DVD?

Fox has, for some unknown reason, negated the 1950s wonder of their CinemaScope process by putting this in a 4:3 letterbox format.  That means that the widescreen picture is only displayed in the 4:3 center of a widescreen TV, rather than using the whole screen.  I've tried everything I can think of to adjust the display, but it just can't be done while keeping the image in its intended aspect ratio.  (I'd be very happy to be proven wrong.).  It's better than pan-and-scan, but it could have been done right, as the Warner Archive does with its widescreen releases.  (The picture quality is also pretty grainy, not nearly as sharp as Fox's exemplary releases like DESK SET, but maybe they don't have a better print.)

So, this is definitely a movie worth watching, and it can be enjoyed on this less-than-perfect DVD.  But it's a shame that Fox didn't do it right.",1408665600,11,1230,4.652777777777778
