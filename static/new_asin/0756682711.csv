7788375,5,0756682711,"Whether you are looking for travel guides or books about science topics, DK has the very best books, hands down.  They present difficult subject in such a way that even young people can grasp the basics and are not only entertained but engrossed by it.  DK also understands that time honored adage that ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" and they make certain that their text is liberally accompanied by the most beautiful pictures that you can imagine.  All in all, any DK book that I have ever purchased, and I have purchased over 45, has been a true pleasure and never a disappointment.",1402704000,,592,4.619047619047619
