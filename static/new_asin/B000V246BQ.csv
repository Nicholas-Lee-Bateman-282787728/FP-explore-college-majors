8216294,4,B000V246BQ,I like this video because of the cute kids and for what it tries to do.  It shows one little kid on screen at a time pronouncing alphabet letters and numbers to the best of their ability. The numbers and letters are sometimes spoken in rhythm combined with body movements which I am sure enhances learning. My criticism is that sometimes I could not understand what the kids were saying and the choice of words during the phonics portion.  My 2 year old grandson repeats the letters and numbers right along with the kids.  This is short simple DVD for ages 18months to 4years in my opinion.
