8209813,5,B000TJLGFK,No one person should have to endure torture in any country! Torture can be physical and or psychological. Any one person who tortures another is just that...a torturer! I feel awful for the prisoners who suffered. This video reminds me why freedom of thought should never be taken away from the people. Thank you for making this DVD!,1444435200,,333,4.758620689655173

8209817,5,B000TJLGFK,"This is an excellent film about the Romanian experience of Communist torture. The interviews will inform the viewer of the depths of horrible physical and psychological methods used by the Russians. These stories need to be told because Communism committed even more crimes than Nazism, but has cleverly concealed these atrocities.",1358553600,5,331,5.509803921568627
8209818,5,B000TJLGFK,"This is a documentary about the gulag (in Romania) that students interested in Cold War Era history, or students exploring religious persecution in the 20th Century should definitely put on their viewing lists.

The documentary is not too long, but it is very well narrated and two of the survivors interviewed, Fr. Roman and Fr. George of the Orthodox Church, offer a perspective that is probably hard for some to imagine could even be reached by the very victims of this horrible system. Nothing in this short documentary is superfluous.

To say ""I love it"" is not exactly true.  One does not love such a film, but one can truly value and recommend the film to others.  This documentary deserves praise and wide circulation.",1232841600,11,726,4.830645161290323
8209819,5,B000TJLGFK,"Communism is at its root nihilistic. Ignoring the dignity of humanity, it seeks to subvert what is unique to the personality and replace it with the bland generality of the prefabricated ""new man"". This DVD traces the horrible and failed communist experiments on psychlogical manipulation and brings forth the light of human dignity as found in the image of God, the God Who is love.

What is most interesting is that such insanity not only produced great evil, but great good. A few of the interviews are those of Orthodox priests who have great love and forgiveness for those who committed such evil against them, recalling the words of Christ, ""Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do.""

The jacket describes it as follows: ""When you said, 'I still believe in God,' in five minutes you were full of blood. - Roman Braga. Many of us died, many of us became mad, but in some of us the good triumphed. - George Calciu. These chilling words from two survivors of a brainwashing prison in Pitesti, Romania are sad reminders of the legacy of Stalinist communism. Beyond Torture: The Gulag of Pitesti, Romania documents the persecution of Romanians under the communist regime. Electrical shock, hallucinogenic drugs, near starvation and fatal beatings were daily rituals in the prison of Pitesti, Romania. But this sadistic story goes beyond torture: this was an attempt to totally destroy a people's culture and faith.

In 1949, Stalinist Soviets began a systematic sweep of Romanian college campuses. Their purpose was to imprison and transform young Romanians into a communistic way of thinking. One prisoner describes this re-education as the most vile tortures imaginable. Orthodox priest Father George Calcui says, They tried to destroy our souls. But he and others survived this gulag, lived to tell their stories and even forgave their captors.

In this documentary, you'll meet three survivors from the prison of Pitesti and see shocking paintings that capture the essence of the extreme torture. This DVD also includes an in-depth one-hour interview with Father Roman Braga: prison survivor and spiritual leader.

Outside of Romania, this DVD is the first major historical documentation of the Pitesti experience.

Not recommended for young children.""",1231632000,10,3537,7.077803203661327
