8092849,5,B000BUHEZ8,"""Where is Everybody"" endearingly introduces the running theme, the very spirit, of what defines the Twilight Zone. A man alone (Earl Holliman) finds himself totally isolated in an unfamiliar town, yet with very familiar surroundings found in any ""Hometown America"" setting. But, who is he, where is he and why is he there?

""Nick Of Time"" from the Second season aired on November 18, 1960 and was written by Richard Matheson. Traveling newlyweds William Shatner and Patricia Breslin stop in a luncheonette while their car is being repaired. While in a booth an ever-confident Shatner puts a coin into a fortune-telling machine adorned with the bobbling head of a smiling plastic devil. Each question and answer begins to make Shatner question his fate to the point that he becomes unraveled about his future. Thematically this is similar to THE FEVER where just one more coin in the machine may give you solace. This is a fascinating episode that bears repeated viewing just to observe the ease at which one can be drawn in. However, the denouement makes the morality of the story clear.

""Perchance To Dream"" with Richard Conte is a classic. It is horrific in nature and the image of Suzanne Lloyd as Maya the mysterious woman is haunting to this day. Definitely written by Charles Beaumont. Richard Conte plays a man terrified of falling asleep. If he succumbs to the alluring and spellbinding mysterious woman he meets in his dreams he fears she will murder him in his dream and simultaneously kill him in reality. He must never fall asleep again.

John Dehner is excellent in ""The Jungle"" another psychological drama written by Charles Beaumont based on irrational fear. I like this tale of a rather sophisticated and educated contractor (John Dehner) who has violated certain African tribal lands. This episode plays on your own personal paranoia for what is seen and unseen, what is written and unwritten, what is natural and what is spiritual. When two opposite sides of the coin meet then we come face to face with our fears. The episode is timeless.",1379721600,,2058,4.908045977011494
8092850,4,B000BUHEZ8,"This videotape in ""'The Twilight Zone' Collector's Edition"" starts off with the premier episode of Rod Serling's celebrated television anthology series and ends with one of my favorites, which is sort of known as the ""other"" William Shatner episode.  Serling only wrote one of the four episodes, which simply reminds us that one of the reasons this is a classic television series is that it had a bunch of great writers coming up with journeys of imagination each week:

Episode 1, ""Where is Everybody?"" (first aired October 2, 1959), was the first of those journeys.  Serling tells the story of Mike Ferris (Earl Holliman), who finds himself wearing an Air Force jumpsuit in a deserted town.  He has no clue who he is, where he is, or how he ended up there.  Of course, all will be revealed in the end as we are introduced to the ""Zone"" twist for this first time.  While this episode was obviously good enough to get the series on the air and to introduce it to the viewing audience, it ends up being a lesser effort given what is to come.  Still, having the pilot episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" on tape counts for something.

Episode 9, ""Perchance to Dream"" (November 27, 1959), was written by Charles Beaumont from his own short story.  Edward Hall (Richard Conte) tells his psychiatrist (John Larch) about nightmarish dreams in which Maya (Suzanne Lloyd), a carnival dancer, is trying to scare him to death. Because of a heart condition, if the dreams do not kill Hall, trying to stay awake will. An okay first season episode, Beaumont's exploration of dreams is much better in his later episode, ""Shadow Play.""

Episode 77, The Jungle"" (First aired December 1, 1961) is also written by Beaumont based on another one of his short story. Engineer Alan Richards (John Dehner) has returned from a project in Africa under a voodoo curse. It seems the local witch doctor took exception to the hydroelectric dam he built. Alan's wife slips him a protective charm thinking that could help, but unfortunately he leaves it behind in a bar one night. A nice little tale of suspense which works well with minimal special effects, but by no means a classic.

Episode 43, ""Nick of Time"" (First aired November 18, 1960) was written by Richard Matheson and stars William Shatner and Patricia Breslin as newly weds Don and Pat Carter. The honeymooners are waiting for their car to be repaired in Ridgeview, Ohio when the superstitious Don becomes obsessed with a table top fortune-telling machine that dispense little cards answering yes or no questions. This is a classic ""Twilight Zone"" episode, which takes the simple premise of what is basically a Magic 8 Ball from Hell and makes it all perfectly plausible.  It also has a wonderful performance from a rather restrained Shatner who is always remembered for doing ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" a couple of seasons later, but this one was first and is better.  If you really love this episode be aware that there is a t-shirt for the episode is out there along with instructions on how to build the fortune-telling machine from scratch (no pun intended; really).  Is this a great country or what?",1135123200,,3134,4.768946395563771
