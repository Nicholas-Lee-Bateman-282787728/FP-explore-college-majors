8515373,2,B007EQQS4A,"This documentary features plenty of female musicians that are too young to remember when punk rock was a dangerous, non-middle class phenomenon.  To be fair, a few of the best of the best are featured:  Tribe 8, Blatz, Bikini Kill, etc.  I don't want to seem insensitive, but it seems like the younger female punk bands featured in this film want to distance themselves from the very pioneers that defied punk's penchant for testosterone-fueled posturing.  Watching this made me feel sorry for the younger ladies, because they seemed to be unaware of the uphill battle plenty of ladies had to fight in order to defy punk rock's tendency to be a neanderthal sausage party.  It's good to have plenty of critical voices, but most of the bands featured in this documentary border on extreme superficiality.",1389398400,7,802,4.911111111111111
8515374,5,B007EQQS4A,"This has been a great documentary that highlights real women's issues and contributions to the punk scene from the ladies themselves that have put so much effort into changing their scene, why they did it, and what it meant to them. As someone who grew up in the DIY punk scene who met a lot of resistance being a woman, it was refreshing to hear real influential punk women's point of views on how they first were introduced to the scene, the issues they have confronted, and what they have done to impact their scene. Highly recommended for anyone interested in built from the ground up feminist movements and fans of the punk scene in general. SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SCENE!",1388534400,2,672,4.608333333333333
8515375,5,B007EQQS4A,I really wasn't expecting to see this on Amazon Prime. Saw the premiere in a DIY venue and actually know a few of the Midwest gals. Hopefully this will inspire women and girls to do what they want to do and play HARD.,1379894400,,217,4.069767441860465
8515376,4,B007EQQS4A,"So I'm reviewing again. This documentary took awhile to grow on me. These ladies are not the usual suspects from the 90s music scene. I was bored until they started talking about real life and how it doesn't stop even when one is in their comfort zone. Most of these  bands are hardcore and that is a genre I personally don't like, but in the end this doc. is about much more than music...its a call to arms. Its about not caring what others think and doing things for yourself. That's a message we all can use in our daily lives.",1365724800,5,530,4.247524752475248
