2148329,5,B0002YLCGK,"When we purchased Aladdin the preview says that The return of Jafar/ Aladdin and the king of thieves will be released on Jan. 18, 2005.  Not only is this my oldest son's 14th birthday, it's NEW MOVIE TUESDAY so can you imagine what a big deal this day was in my home?  I seriously doubt it!

Iago finally sees that it's sink of fly when it comes to selfish, greedy Jafar!  As Iago does what he cans to convince Aladdin that he was sincere we get the chance to see Iago become a genuine friend to Aladdin as he saves him from Jafar.

Aladdin and Jasmine are getting married!  FINALLY, well they have to survive the 40 thieves who are there looking for riches.  Aladdin is suffering from the blues of not knowing if he's the right husband family material.  He was orphaned so young.  Watch as Aladdin travel around and finds anwsers to his unanswered questions.

I am so happy that this movie was re-released and trust me Jade, and Marquis are getting our money's worth from this dual disc collection.",1106438400,5,999,4.43956043956044
2148330,3,B0002YLCGK,"Disney suddenly recognized the marketing potential of direct-to-video sequels in the 90's. The 1994 sequel to Aladdin entitled The Return of Jafar had none of the style that made Aladdin so memorable. With second rate songs, a second rate story clearly designed as a pilot for the TV series The Return of Jafar could have been produced by any studio and the generic quality of the film is one of its principle flaws. On a scale from A to F, I'd have to rate Jafar as a C-. The animation has little of the character one expects from Disney and has bottom of the barrel production values. The only redeeming qualities are the return of actors  Jonathan Freeman, Gilbert Gottfried, Scott Weinger, Linda Larkin. Dan Castellaneta stands in for Robin Williams who got into a royal pissing match with Disney when they used his voice without permission for toys and marketing purposes. In ""The Return of Jafar"" the evil sorcerer returns to try and take over the kingdom and get revenge against the ""street rat"" Aladdin. Even a guest appearance by Jason Alexander can't save this from being strictly mediocre at best. The songs are second rate and can't hold a candle to the brilliant material written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman from the first film. This film is in a standard aspect ratio meaning it was designed for a square TV screen. ""Thieves"", on the other hand, has been presented in a 1.78:1 widescreen format so it will play well on 16x9 widescreen TVs. I know the original VHS version of ""Thieves"" was in a standard format and this is the first I've seen of the film in 1.78:1 widescreen (although it might have been in that format for laserdisc).

""Aladdin and the King of Thieves"" improves on Jafar.  With a larger budget, smoother animation, better production design and the return of Robin Williams as Genie, the third film almost approaches the majesty of the first. Aladdin goes in search of his father and, with the help of an enchanted septer found among the King's treasures, he finds him only to discover that his father leads the 40 Thieves. With appearances by the late Jerry Orbach and the return of the principle cast from the first film, Aladdin and the King of Thieves rates a solid B. Although the songs aren't quite up to Menken and Ashman standards are improved with a variety of songwriters contributing material.

The vibrant colors and slick production design bring the third film closer to the original although it can't quite match the first film for sheer invention. John Rhys-Davies (""Lord of the Rings"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Sliders"") turns in a great performance as Aladdin's father. It sounds as if the director had Sean Connery in mind as Rhys-Davies' performance sounds quite a bit like Connery. Likewise, the late Jerry Orbach's performance as one of the villans of the film is a highlight as well.

 Both films come with games that can be played by tykes. Careful What You Wish For and Disneypedia are the two extras included with Jafar. The former make keep tykes interested one or two times but will lose them with later viewings. The latter discusses different wishing traditions from around the world and is pretty decent although short and very sketchy in terms of details. The best featurettes are saved for Thieves. Loot in the Liar and Bag the Bad Guys are the two games included here. Again, like most Disney games designed for their DVD releases, they'll keep kids interested a couple of times at best. Both of these are at least equal to if not better than the single game on Jafar. Behind the Microphone takes us on a visit with the people who did the voices for Thieves.  It's a solid featurette and once again better than that included on Jafar. There's also a song selection with lyrics that pop up on the screen. That feature will come in handy when the kids want to sing along with the songs for both films. As I mentioned before, none of the tunes can hold a candle to the Menken/Ashman songs but the superior material in Thieves at least has a sense of melody (although Orbach's In or Out song from Thieves should have been left out as its probably one of the worst of the bunch).

Jafar will provide an entertaining diversion for kids who loved Aladdin. While the film compare to the original or the third film Thieves its enjoyable. Thieves, on the other hand, could have been a contender. If Disney had chosen to put a bit more effort and money into it I have no doubt that they could easily have created a classic equal to the original. As it is, Thieves is very close to the quality of the original film with a witty script. The film is hampered by the same limited animation (although superior to Jafar) and by songs that can't hold a candle to the Menken/Ashman songs. The image quality, transfer, sound and extras are all exceptionally good given that these were created for the video market only.",1106006400,39,4870,4.648083623693379
2148331,3,B0002YLCGK,"Being Disney's first direct-to-video/DVD sequel, the animation of ""Return of Jafar"" is understandably lacking compared to the modern DTV's such as ""Lion King 1 1/2"" or the upcoming ""Lilo & Stich 2"".  However, for what it was, it's quite an enjoyable film and a must-buy for any big fans of Disney's Aladdin franchise, or of the villain Jafar.

Jafar is likely one of Disney's most popular villains; and as such the third film in this trilogy, ""Aladdin & the King of Thieves"" is somewhat lacking without him.  This movie does have one thing going for it, though, and that is Robin Williams returning to reprise his role as the Genie, who was voiced by Dan Castellaneta in ""Return of Jafar"".

As for those reviewers complaining of the lack of a widescreen release of these two movies; neither of these movies were animated for widescreen.  Being direct-to-video products of the mid-1990's that never achieved theatrical release, their original aspect ratios are 1.33:1, the same as most television programs.",1106006400,9,1005,4.994011976047904

2148333,3,B0002YLCGK,"Aladdin has proven to be one of Disney's more popular modern classics and is the only Disney animated feature to spawn two straight-to-video sequels (until Lion King 1 1/2's release).
The first (and the first ever Disney DTV sequel) is Return of Jafar. Actually four episodes of the TV show, this mainly suffers from inferior animation (although not bad for TV) and a distinct lack of Robin Williams (Dan's great as Homer but is no Genie!). The character of Iago (one of my favourites but not everyone's cup of tea!) gets a much bigger part and swaps over to the good guys. The plot nicely compliments the original and expands the story without obviously being a cash-in. The songs are surprisingly good and the Song Selection feature allows for the words to appear on screen. The rest of the 'special' features are pretty poor and include the weakest Disneypedia to date and a couple of games that hardly hold the attention never mind challenge the mind.
More successful as a film is King of Thieves. Being better animated and seeing Williams return as Genie (what happened to his vow never to work for the studio after the original film?), the irony is that Genie has very little to do with the plot which concerns Aladdin and his reunion with his father. Williams adds his improv skills to the script and comes up trumps with several stand-out scenes including the opening wedding scene and a wonderful cameo by Hope and Crosby. Again the songs are surprisingly good (better than Return of Jafar's) and this DVD also has the Song Selection facility. The rest of the extras on this disc are even more bland than the last and neither deserve their 'Special Edition' tags.
King of Thieves makes up for Return of Jafar's short-comings but neither are a patch on the original.",1099008000,15,1774,4.725806451612903

Return of Jafar

This is the second Aladdin movie. It is isn't the best of the series because this movie was created solely to launch the TV series. The story-line, new voices, and changed Arabian Night's song was purely to set up the story-line for the TV series. Having Aladdin having to prove himself to be able to Marry Jasmine, and the 1st episode of the series dealing with the follow up aftermath of Abismol surviving.

2148348,2,B0002YLCGK,"Of course, this series is a classic from our time; and when I was a kid I loved these movies.  To be sure, there's absolutely no profanity, violence, or sex.  That is not where I feel like this movie gets into trouble.

As a Christian, I believe firmly in the scriptures command that magic and sorcery is evil and is not to be accepted in any way whatsoever, and in talking to friends who were enjoying more serious forms of it, I've even had Aladdin brought up as a way of justifying how innocent it is.

I believe this series does nothing more than dull our senses and make us comfortable with ""magic"" by believing it is innocent, and, even, ""child's play"".",1378944000,,659,4.377049180327869

2148368,3,B0002YLCGK,"This two disc set is the only official way to get the direct to video sequels to Aladdin.  While they have their moments, they are worth it only for die hard fans.

Up first is ""Return of Jafar.""  In it, Jafar and Iago manage to escape from the Cave of Wonders and set out for the palace.  Iago wants to get back into the palace, but Jafar is intent on revenge.  Can he ruin Aladdin's new life?  And how do you kill an all powerful genie?

Rounding out the trilogy is ""Aladdin and the King of Thieves.""  Aladdin and Jasmine are getting married, but their wedding is interrupted by a band of thieves.  Once Aladdin learns that his supposedly dead father is the leader, he takes off to try to find and reform him.  Can he do it?  And what kind of problems will this family reunion hold for all involved?

The movies are okay, but they pale in comparison to the original.  The majority of the voice cast is back (Robin Williams is painfully absent from ""Jafar."")  The stories and fast paced and move along well.  Unfortunately, Aladdin spends a lot of time lying in both of these films.  You'd think he'd learn nothing good ever comes from that.  And the animation, while good, isn't at the same level as the original.

The biggest strike against these movies is the songs.  They never capture the magic of the original and actually slow both stories down.

These movies are diverting and aren't a complete waste of time.  However, they also aren't nearly as good as the movie that spawned them.  Proceed with caution, but get them if you are interested.",1208649600,,1551,4.464285714285714

2148370,5,B0002YLCGK,"I don't understand why these movies are so panned by everyone. I actually like the sequels just as much as the original, infact, in the case of ""The Return of Jafar"" I like it more than the original classic. Why?

They are incredibly FUN movies. Fun to just get lost in and have a blast with the characters. ""Return of Jafar"" features some of the best Disney songs ever to sing along too. ""Forget About Love"" actually has the honor of being my FAVOURITE Disney song of all-time. It starts off very humourous and fun to just sing along to, then slows down and takes a more romantic spin. If you haven't heard this song... I'd reccommend seeing the movie for it alone. ""Only Second Rate"" and ""Nothing like a friend"" are also fantastic songs.

As for ""King of Theives""... Robin Williams back as the Genie just works so well. I think the Genie is at his comedic BEST in ""King of Theives"". A story of greed, family and love. Fantastic family film. Kids will love it... Hell, anyone that likes good dumb fun and cartoons will love it.

Bottomline is... People love the original so much that having sequels to it ""have to be blasphemy"". But if you open your mind, you'll see these are adorably fun movies that not only kids would love... You could too.",1204675200,10,1245,4.451754385964913
2148371,3,B0002YLCGK,Again these were a couple titles that I didn't have in my Disney DVD collection yet and wanted. I enjoyed them for the most part!,1204416000,,129,4.2
2148372,4,B0002YLCGK,"This was Disney's attempt to capitalize on the hit of the original.  As we know from High School Musical, Disney does not always know when they have a hit.  Unfortunately much of THe Return of Jafar is way below the standards of the original.  The characters are pale imitations of their originals, even though most of the same actors are playing them.  The Genie (not Robin Williams) was barely okay.  He isn't awful, they just play him down in favor of Gilbert Gottfried's delightfully obnoxious Iago.  Some of the animation is quite wild and wonderful (such things as the psychodelic final sequence where Jafar meets his doom.)  But other sections are ho-hum.  The Sultan seems actually to be paler in color than other characters.  THe animation was apparently done in Japan, judging by the list of animators.  The songs are half-hearted at best.

The King of Thieves is a major step up.  The music is not quite up to the standards of the original, but the songs are far above Jafar.  One moment I actually thought they might insert the ""Proud of your boy"" song they deleted from Aladdin.  The characters are all back to standard Disney level, and the story is actually interesting, too.  Robin Williams is held in check - a little bit - but still manages to create the great blue genie in true technicolor qualities.  I'd rate King of Thieves a 5 star and Jafar 3.  The quality is that noticeably different.",1193443200,,1411,4.670731707317073

2148378,4,B0002YLCGK,"A lot of the other reviewers have been rather harsh on what are, ultimately, cartoons. Not that I dismiss these as solely ""kid movies"" -- but they aren't live action, and such cutting criticism is unwarranted. Movie sequels almost never live up to the originals, and certain qualities always suffer -- in animated films, the depth of the art is the first thing to go. There's no reason that a movie can't still be enjoyable in spite of that, though.

I do think, however, that these movies need to be considered separately. Return of Jafar is, in fact, little better than an extended episode of the TV show. Not that I think there's really anything wrong with this, but it does show -- the animation quality and the vocal acting simply aren't up to movie standard. The plotline, while amusing, is a little flat. There isn't a lot of dimension to any of the characters, and I feel Jasmine most cheated. From the independant, strong, and charismatic heroine of the original film, she becomes far too girly and weak in this sequel. I confess, though, I wasn't as bothered by the lack of Robin Williams here as many reviewers seem to have been. I think there's more to fault with the script than with Dan Castellaneta's skills. For all its flaws, though, this movie is still entertaining, and far from painful to watch. It's a cut above a lot of Disney sequels, that's for sure, and while casual viewers may not delight in it, for a hardcore Aladdin fan like me, it's a fun addition to the saga.

Aladdin and the King of Thieves approaches the quality of the original film. The animation is much closer to feature film standard -- there are still corners cut, most notably in backgrounds and crowd scenes, but the use of shadows, the subtleties of colour and movement, and the expressions of the characters are all of high quality. Where this film really wins out, though, is in the heart -- the story has real emotion to it, and the characters regain the depth they had in the original. Jasmine, it should be noted, returns to her strong and active self, and the new addition to the cast, Cassim, is enchanting (helped in no small part by the vocal acting of John Rhys-Davies, who is doing his best Sean Connery impersonation here). The plotline is not only interesting, with a return to rollicking adventure, but rather touching as well, and the script regains some of the wit and dynamic of the original. This is by far the better of the two sequels, a true joy to watch.

Ultimately, though, these are both far and away the best of the Disney sequels -- certainly much superior to the DTV ones being put out today, as Disney feels compelled to milk every movie it ever made for secondary material. Getting Return of Jafar and King of Thieves together in this set is definitely the best value -- and definitely worth the purchase!",1141344000,5,2829,4.586956521739131

The Return of Jafar lost me when Robin Williams didn't return as the the lovable guinie. He is what made the first so great. It has a good story line but just wasn't the same.

With Aladdin and the King of Thieves, I did enjoy the return of Robin Williams, but it is just hard for any movie sequal to keep the magic in it.",1128643200,,408,3.9036144578313254

King of Thieves was quite okay. I have a copy of it, actually. But, it's nothing special and just a normal Disney sequel. The songs are decent but compares nothing to what Alan Menken and Howard Ashman/ Tim Rice wrote. Owell, at least Robin Williams was back as the Genie so that was nice.

I compared the DVD to the VHS of Thieves and realized that for the DVD, they added a black bar at the top and bottom OF THE FULLSCREEN VERSION!  So you're seeing EVEN LESS of the movie with the new DVD version in comparison to the fullscreen VHS version!  I can't tell you how ticked off this makes me.  MGM recently got in trouble for pulling this type of tactic and it looks like Disney is heading down the same slope.  BTW, the best part of the movie for comparison is during the Brady Bunch part of the 'Father and Son' song.  Chopped off at the top and bottom.  Nice.

Plus Gilbert Godfrieds horrible singing as I AGO was catchy all the songs were catchy. I heard on the DVD and BLURAY versions of RETURN OF JAFAR that DISNEY edited out JAFARS flashing skeleton after IAGO kicked his lamp into the lava seriously WHAT THE HELL DISNEY have we become so puss whipped we can't show any violence. If you still have a good working VHS copy of RETURN OF JAFAR keep for this reason Another thing that endeared RETURN OF JAFAR was ABIS MAL hilariously played by SEINFELDS Jason Alexander. THE KING OF FORTY THERES also has bad animation though it is much improved over RETURN OF JAFAR the overall story can stand up against the original even though the animation and songs can't these are not complaints I LOVE THE HELL OUT OF THE WHOLE TRILOGY. There are a few scenes where the animation in KING OF THERES can stand up against the original. any scene with THE ORACLE is animated BEAUTIFULLY probably because DISNEY used CGI a new technology that DISNEY and PIXAR started with TOY STORY another one of my FAVORITE TRILOGIES. The scene where ALADDIN, ABU, IAGO, and CARPET follow the thieves to their secret hideout and ALADDIN'S Dad shouts OPEN SESEME and the waters part like in EXODUS where MOSES parted THE RED SEA. The scene where ALADDIN'S father shows him that sunken pirate ship turned to solid gold and finally THE VANISHING ISLE and THE GOLDEN HAND OF MIDAS those scenes had as much SPLENDOR as THE CAVE OF WONDERS. One final thought there were two scenes in THE RETURN OF JAFAR that were WONDERFULLY ANIMATED. The scene where ABIS MAL and JAFAR kidnap THE SULTAN on HORRIFYING BLACK DRAGON HORSES and the CLIMAX where JAFAR turns the ground into lava. The lava looked just as real as the lava in the original ALADDIN in THE CAPE OF WONDERS",1420243200,,2224,4.576441102756892

8034974,4,B0002YLCGK,"With Return, the animation was very poor, and hearing Iago sing was hard to handle, but it wasn't bad. With King of Thieves, most of these issues were corrected. Aladdin's back story was interesting, and the Genie was hilarious, as usual. The voice of Aladdin's father, some swear it's Sean Connery, but his name wasn't in the credits, so I don't know. The songs in these two, were overall, a lot of fun. With Return though, some friend of mine spoiled the conclusion, luckily w/out too much detail, so it's no big deal. Even though Iago can't sing well, if at all, some of his lines were pretty funny. And Dan Castellanata as the genie could've been worse. King of Thieves was a good wrap-up, even though a few scenes were a tad over the top.",1390262400,,743,4.470588235294118
