8460690,3,B0057GUCPU,"A rather depressing look at young relationships ending.  We don't really get to know the characters very well, and the continual change of scene from one pair to another is jarring and, at times, confusing.  One element that adds to the interest, though, is that all the relationships are interracial, involving several races overall.  Perhaps in the world of cinema, there is room for a film that just looks at breakups, but the lack of a larger story line here leaves this film a real downer that seemingly has no point.",1414195200,,522,4.714285714285714
8460691,3,B0057GUCPU,I liked this especially since it's different from the rest of gay movies. I had previously watched Rebound by the same director. I like this one more even if I gave 5 stars to the other one. My main complaint would be that it was short. It's a great film for the price though.,1331683200,2,276,4.12962962962963
8460692,1,B0057GUCPU,At  57 minutes this is hardly a feature film. However  I  found  myself having to fast forward it at times  as it was so tedious. They try to sell the film as a gay film by putting a  very pretty  man on the  sleeve of the dvd. Don't be fooled as he is only in the film for a few minutes. This isn't a gay movie- some of the  characters are gay and some are straight. There is nothing in this film to warrant you wasting your time  and money  in buying a copy. One has to ignore  people who rate  5 stars  for boring films on Amazon as they are probably  connected with the films.,1317168000,7,580,3.8793103448275863
8460693,5,B0057GUCPU,Apart is short with only 60 minutes but it's very sweet. The characters are very different from each other and they are all facing the same challenge. If you're looking for a big budget film you will be disappointed but if you can look beyond the technical challenges you will find a great film in Apart. Got the DVD from TLA Video!,1315612800,3,332,4.370967741935484
