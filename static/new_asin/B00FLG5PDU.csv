8616702,5,B00FLG5PDU,"I bought another DVD player that would play all regions (around $60) ---worth every penny to see this & others that won't play on US players. I bought this series for less money through E-Bay. Excellent actors, animals, photography, story line. VERY sad when we saw the last episode. But in a few years we'll watch it again as we're doing now with Downton Abbey. You will not be disappointed - unless you like sex scenes, nudity, filthy/raw language, violence, macabre, spirits. It will be absent from this series.",1503100800,,514,4.786516853932584

8616704,5,B00FLG5PDU,"Saw season 1 on Netflix and since the rest of the series wasn't available I decided to purchase the entire series.  Previously I purchased an inexpensive DVD player from Amazon to watch non-region 1 DVD's so I was able watch this set.  I really enjoyed it - great family entertainment - enjoyable plots, characters, location, etc.",1443571200,3,330,4.875
