7852441,5,6303668372,"This is just a great video which shows the true Morrissey show. Of course the shows aren't like this anymore. Too many people have thrown things at him and he is not that approachable anymore. That is a good thing. It was just good to see ""fatty""  live on video.",1183161600,,262,4.24
7852442,5,6303668372,"It may take a devout Morrissey fan to want to buy a live performance on VHS - but Introducing Morrissey is so expertly crafted that you know the film-makers are treating you with as much respect as they do Morrissey. His band is hot and rock solid, the sound is superb & powerful and the performance is beyond any expectations. This is a very special live video experience - by the end I was in tears from being emotionally rocked. You want to reach through the screen and give Morrissey a great big hug - as so many of his live audience succeeded in doing.

This is just about the best live film I've seen of any band - ever.",1100476800,2,626,4.216666666666667
7852443,5,6303668372,"Introducing Morrissey... It's a must-be-owned Morrissey Video that gives the brief description of all of the tours and gigs he had made so far. The great editing of 2 nights makes the audience cheer for Morrissey. Watch it, and Morrissey will be your living idol.",994809600,2,263,4.866666666666666
7852444,5,6303668372,"Morrissey is the Savior. There is and never will be anyone like him and his music transcends time and fads. You can always count on Morrissey to fix what's wrong or make you feel better because......he understands. This video, filmed on his '95 tour, is full of the best songs off of ""Your Arsenal"" and Vauxhall & I"" and it's a fantastic concert film. Morrissey and his band sound absolutely fantastic, and it's not doctored at all. I can testify that because I've seen Morrissey live and he always sounds like the record.....and even better! This is a must have for any Morrissey disciple.......but only, if you're really interesting........we'll let you know.",972518400,7,661,4.910714285714286
7852445,5,6303668372,"Although it doesn't contain many classic songs it is pretty much the video version of the ""world of morrissey"" cd, which is a compilation of superb b sides and notorious cuts from ""vauxhall and i"" and  ""your arsenal"" , his most celebrated albums. Morrisey's live act  is decent (his shows have never been visually appealing except for die-hard  fans, whom you see storming onstage to touch their hero as is their  custom), however its superb musically both for the themes of some of his  songs (which can give you an idea of his obsession ridden lyrics and his  almost mythical pessimistic genius) and the gorgeous melodies of the tunes.  I love all of his songs so I can't quite criticize him but this video is  contains some of his best solo work....",959126400,4,752,4.643939393939394
7852446,4,6303668372,"Either you like Morrissey or you don't.  If your reading this its probably the latter. In that case, I wouldhighly recommnd this video.  Shot live in concert, except for a couple songs, all are from the Vauxhall and I and  Your Arsenal CD's. Two of his better CD's.  His band is no Smiths but  pretty good, sounding just like the record, but you cant see the band too  much as  the camera lingers on Morrissey alot.  It's worth the 20 bucks,  though, just to hear Morrissey sing ""youre the one for me,  fatty,"" to a live audience.  He has this ""Im more clever than  you"" smirk the whole time. By the end of the show, assorted fatties  and others of both genders storm the stage, one at a time (it almost looks  staged) to politely touch their hero. The irony (and presumption?) of it  all is pure Morrissey!  Overall, a video you can pop in instead of a CD  and listen while your cleaning the house, etc.",952732800,2,904,4.317365269461078
7852447,5,6303668372,"Absolutely wonderful live footage that catches Morrissey looking and singing at his best. Plenty from ""Vauxhall"" with great additions from his beautiful ""World"". A must for any true Morrissey fan.",921888000,4,196,5.566666666666666
