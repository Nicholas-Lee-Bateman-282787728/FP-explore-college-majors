8463772,3,B005AZSJSA,"I was looking forward to watching this, Byron was quite a character and his exploits were anything but dull. I'd imagined that a gay actor retracing his footsteps would be fun to watch and full of all the cutting wit and clever insight so many gay guys have. Unfortunately in places it was more like watching Southpark's Mr Slave follow Byron's footsteps embarrassing strangers with constant inappropriate references to everyone's anus. If I had a dollar for the number of times he repeated that the Turks were into sherbet and sodomy I'd could have paid for the DVD.  I cringed as he dry humped women he was interviewing and they forced laughter to defuse what was obviously an uncomfortable situation. He greets Turkish guests at an embassy by telling them how much Turks enjoy sodomy. Some no doubt do and that's fine, but the poor people in question looked like they couldn't get away quickly enough. I know Byron was outrageous, and Rupert is a fine actor who I think was perhaps trying to pick up on that. But for me it was a bit cringe-worthy in places for a 21st century production.

But notwithstanding that, the series is well filmed and interesting. It offers an insight into Byron's grand tour and some of the events that shaped his life. If you're interested in Byron I think you would enjoy most of this!",1379894400,,1318,4.652360515021459
