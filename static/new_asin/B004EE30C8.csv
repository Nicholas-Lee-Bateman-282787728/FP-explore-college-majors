4336599,5,B004EE30C8,The adaptation of  this comic book series(All star superman) into the movie form that was given is brilliant. The comic book story is quite honestly made to be only read in its original context....a comic book. You can not expect a traced outline when you view this movie. Purism only devalues crafted work. All star Superman the movie is a must see and i would say the best story ever done for home viewing......best story ever done for superman for the home that is available on dvd.,1297728000,11,485,4.574712643678161
4336600,2,B004EE30C8,"This movie had way to much going on. It lacked the focus of the comics, graphic novel or other movies. This is by far one of the worst DC movies made. It may be that they tried to sum up a story in 74mins. But this movie is at best a rental via Amazon. Animation was great I didn't like all the character designs but Lex in Green Superman in red blue and yellow was fine. The writer Dwayne McDuffie and director Sam Liu did what no villain could ever have done killed Superman.",1297641600,11,477,4.085106382978723
4336601,2,B004EE30C8,"I never read the comic books this is based on but as entertainment this
is pretty weak.
It's incoherent,disjointed and in many sections just plain silly.
It has some mature scenes and others that look like they were written for 8 yr olds.
Much of it didn't make any sense.
I suspected it could end up like this because Superman isn't the deepest character out there.
Can't recommend this at all.
This is 2 duds in a row for DC as the Shazam/Superman one was lame as well.",1297641600,9,471,4.363636363636363
4336602,2,B004EE30C8,"I've read the All Star Superman comic series and loved all of the DC Movies featuring Superman/Batman.
However, this particular movie is a real Disappointment.
It had no real cohesion to the comic's story and the unresolved ending was terrible.
I agree with other reviewers who think that DC should focus on other characters especially
if they are going to put out drivel like this one.",1297641600,11,386,4.863636363636363
4336603,2,B004EE30C8,"I would recomend not picking up this Special Edition since Technically it is only one Featurette and a pair
of Eps of Superman.

Not even the commentary track is on this just the one little handout of an extra... two disks for this?
just get the single version or upgrade to BR for the extras... these guys are wasting our money with
these DVD S.E. just cram one disk with what you can its a 75 min movie.",1297555200,16,405,4.1923076923076925
4336604,4,B004EE30C8,Saw this and loved it. It's a bit of a weird and quirky superman story but it feels genuine enough. The art is more realistic than normal but what ties this movie together is the development of scenes between Lex and Clark Kent. the story seems to flow quickly from one event to the next and not everything is explained. I think the story speaks for itself it's much better than the apocalypse story.,1297555200,21,400,4.418918918918919
4336605,3,B004EE30C8,I really love the look of it. It kept close to the comic. But it also got rid of so much story that made the comic special. This movie jumped all over. Did we really need the Kryptonian astronauts and no Bizzaro? His father dying and seeing his future self was also left out. I love these DC movies and I would watch it again but it's my least favorite. I also wish they would do some movies other then Batman and Superman. They already did a Green Lantern. DC has such a wealth of stories. Wish they would try some other heroes. A Teen Titans movie with the 80's cast that introduced Nightwing would be fantastic. There were talks of it but nothing. You have done the Superman/Batman thing. Move forward.,1297468800,12,705,4.348484848484849
4336606,4,B004EE30C8,"I am going to preface this review with a fact.  I love comics and superhero stuff...but loathe DC's Big Blue Boyscout..SUPERMAN.  I despise him for very geeky, and humanistic reasons.  I believe in the train of thought that suggests that Superman is a God among men, a would be tyrant that only finds acceptance because of his shear strength and powers and the fact that he is a 'small town boy made good'...humans love stuff like that. I believe that Superman not only despises human beings..but thinks we are weak, bumbling, socially awkward, and a bit naive.  All of this is evident by the way he chooses to 'blend' in with the human race...by pretending to be  weak, bumbling, socially awkward, and a bit naive...that is how he sees humans..it's what he thinks of you.  I hate SUPERMAN!  (granted...this argument is similar to Lex Luthor's view of him..but...does that mean it's incorrect?)
Anyway...to the review of the DVD.
If you have read any of my reviews, then you know that I love the direct to DVD animated movies that have been coming out from DC and MARVEL in the last five or so years and this offering is another stellar addition to my DVD collection.
The story is excellently translated from the comic, and brilliantly animated.  I know one of the reviewers was balking on the voice talent..but they all did a really good job in my opinion.  The characters where tweaked a little to bring them up to date..or modernize them...and while at first I did not know what to think about this...it works and was a good idea for those of us who aren't the biggest Superman fan.  The story is another of those where Lex Luthor tries to defeat Superman stories.  We have all seen Lex try this countless times before...and it does sound a little cliche...but it is surprisingly fresh, made so by the clever writing and character development.  What I really like most about this DVD is that the characters really shine.  Lex IS an evil genius bent on world domination and the destruction of Superman.  Superman is a god like alien who is obviously ego centric and arrogant but pretends not to be.  The only down side I can mention for this DVD is that in my opinion they spent too much time on the romantic teasing between Lois and Supermen...but the story overall is a good one and works.
I won't give the whole story away..as the devil is in the details and this one is chock full of minute little instances of brilliance that the viewer will enjoy discovering on their own.

There is also a very cool sneak peak at the upcoming ""Green Lantern Emerald Knights""...Henry Rollins plays Killowog...I can't wait.

Anyway...If you are a lover or a hater of the Man of Steel...this DVD will deliver a great story for the guy who can probably be called the ""FIRST SUPERHERO""..go out and buy it..if not for you then for your children...or that special comic geek in your life.",1297123200,22,2873,4.624015748031496
4336607,2,B004EE30C8,"In general, I love the DC animated series and movies. I've always been a DC fan, and for most of my life have had to suffer through a largely inferior Marvel cast of heroes getting an undue share of the spotlight. The DC animated empire, starting in the 1990s with Batman TAS, has consistently delivered amazing and enduring quality; I work with kids and every once in a while, as a special treat, I am able to show them old episodes of Batman and Superman. And they eat that stuff up.

I'm consistently disappointed, though, that the movies aren't able to retain the stellar voice cast that, in large part, made the animated series so memorable. For instance, I almost can't watch a DCAU Batman film if it doesn't have Kevin Conroy as the Dark Knight. And while I'm neutral with respect to the performances of Tim Daly and George Newbern as Superman, I think Clancy Brown's Lex Luthor is nearly as distinctive and irreplaceable as Conroy's Batman.

It's Brown's absence from this film that is striking to me. I realize that, at times, working actors aren't always available to reprise roles, especially voice actors. But it does sometimes make a difference to the audience, when they have come, over the course of several years, to develop expectations of a certain character's performance. It doesn't matter, in the end, the quality of the replacement: the best voice actor in the world couldn't fill in what's missing if an expected and familiar voice is missing.

Still, I wouldn't simply dismiss this film out-of-hand just because the voice cast is not to my liking. I may end up picking it up, and I may even end up liking it. But, at this time, I'm just sighing wistfully and shaking my head, silently wondering how good this movie could possibly be without Clancy Brown doing his nefarious best as Luthor.",1296604800,14,1813,4.712933753943218
4336608,3,B004EE30C8,I must admit i was disappointed with this movie i'am a huge superman fan and i was hoping for a better movie then this somewhat disappointing movie. This movie is a step above superman returns another sorry movie that was and i do stress was a sad movie in the superman movie universe. If you want a movie that expores superman humanity and has little action in it then this is the film for you. but if you want a knock out slugfest filled doomsday type battle like in the superman doomsday movie then stay clear of this. the final battle were he fought lex luther was ok (lex luther gets the same powers that superman has) I just hope that the new superman movie that is coming out in the future ( i do not know when it is coming out) will be able to bring renewed life and bring fans back to one of the most beloved superheros of all time.,1292198400,13,841,4.1656441717791415
4336619,4,B004EE30C8,"A note here about the Amazon listing.  When I purchased this, it was because it was listed as being Multi-format, DVD and Blu-Ray.  What came was just a Blu-Ray.  After a long conversation with Amazon customer service, I kept this, even though it's not what I was buying it for.  I like getting multi-format (DVD + Blu-Ray) for convenience, especially when there's a minimal price difference.

The movie itself is fantastic.  It's a clean and strong story that is about characters first, which is nice to get from DC.  Well voice acted, strongly animated, it's one of the best Superman stories out there.",1483660800,,604,4.805825242718447

4336642,5,B004EE30C8,"I can honestly say that this take on the superman story is the best iv'e ever seen. both emotionally and suspense wise the movie fully delivers on all fronts. Iv'e been away from superman the comic for quiet some time - but have seen all of the DC movie material that have been available, but non of the other renditions of Supermans story comes close to this one - This knowing that most of the material is from Morrison's: All Star Superman Comic series - the movies overall style is true to the Comic version with bright colors, light humor and great scenes.

The Drawing are fabulous reminding me of the Japanese Anime style, at some points but still with a strong American pen style, voice overs are very good and believable, poses etc. are just wow - there's simple so many good moments in this Movie that its hard not to get surprised on every new picture frame. At one point i was thinking: "" all this goodness must end soon"" but no the movie kept going on with some new cool stuff to marvel over. i guess this movie has all the trademarks of good old solid craftsmanship, teamwork and love towards the superman legacy - witch are very visible when handling old classic elements from other alternative superman comic stories that have been weaved nicely into the story.

end note: i felt a closure to the superman epos, witch was nice.

This is the superman i want to remember..

thank you DC for making this possible",1461024000,,1425,4.4903474903474905

4336647,5,B004EE30C8,"Just finished watching, along with Jeff H., ""All Star Superman"" released by Warner Brothers.
""WOW, these DC animated movies would do really great in a movie theater,"" Jeff said as ""All Star Superman"" closed on a hopeful note.
""I agree, but it all probably comes down to the profit margin line.  It's easier to recoup an investment in a direct-to-DVD release as opposed to what you'd have to spend promoting a movie in theaters,"" I replied.
And it's rather a pity that the DC animated movies are not at least given a limited release run in theaters.  To date, Warner Brothers has done such a good job making these movies - many of which are far superior to the current crop of live action ones.
""All Star Superman"" is a faithful adaptation of the comic book series, which was later released as a graphic novel.
During a rescue mission of manned orbital mission of the Sun, Superman is poisoned by an overdose of solar radiation which is slowly killing him.  Lex Luthor put the mission in peril in order to achieve his life's goal of being the one who killed Superman.
Given the news that he has only a few weeks, if that to live, Superman decides to fulfill a few dreams of his own - revealing Clark Kent as Superman to Lois Lane, finding a home for the Bottled City of Kandor, and giving Lex Luthor an opportunity to redeem himself.
What makes ""All Star Superman"" a special part of the Superman lore of the multiverse is that it rings true to what makes the character of Superman so unique, even as he's facing his own demise.  He only looks back once with regret before saving the world one last time.  It would be interesting to see a live action version of this animated movie.
Strongly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1452297600,,1714,4.516129032258065

Now this particular Superman movie is all about him. He is stricken with an overload of radiation and is going to die. So he prepares for such and opens up his secret life more to Lois Lane. Revealing his true identity and really gets down to the true nature of where he came from. Shares every conceivable detail with her. There are also several types of other adversaries Superman has to face in this movie but in the meantime the plot thickens around Lex Luther and has a grand fight scene in the end when the two face off.

Where the comic story was meandering and disjointed, this movie cuts out all of the tangents and keeps things more focused. And it focuses on the right things too: The relationships between Superman, Lois, and Lex. After watching this, the comic story made a lot more sense to me.

The setup for the tale is this: Lex has tricked Superman into getting overexposed by the sun's rays. This triples his power, while also poisoning his cells. Superman is going to die, and there's nothing he can do about it. In the seriousness of this situation, Superman sets out to ""get his house in order"", so to speak, and accomplish his last-day tasks. There is also a nicely epic confrontation with Lex Luthor.

Good take on the Superman mythos. And I really enjoyed the conclusion of this story. As I said, to me it made way more sense than the comic. Recommended!",1404000000,,929,4.590361445783133

4336704,2,B004EE30C8,"This is an adaptation of a story by Grant Morrison. The story begins with a scientific trip to the sun, a trip that is sabotaged by Lex Luthor, who had previously been released from prison to work for the government on scientific research. Superman saves the mission but the real target of the sabotage was Superman himself. Luthor has engineered events to over-saturate Superman's cells with solar radiation, more than they can handle. In a word: Superman is dying. The remainder of the movie consists of small vignettes dealing with how Superman handles his last days on Earth.

Vignette 1: Superman finally reveals himself to Lois as Clark Kent. And, for her birthday, gives her a potion that gives her super-powers for 24 hours.

Vignette 2: Samson and Atlas, musclebound clowns, arrive to court Lois since, as time travelers, they know of his impending death. After a series of events, Superman settles things with an arm-wrestling contest.

Vignette 3: Clark Kent shows up at Luthor's jail cell for an exclusive interview with the condemned scientist. In the process, we find out more about Lex's antipathy towards Superman: ""Doesn't his very existence diminish you? Diminish us all? ... Next to Superman, even Lex Luthor's greatness is overshadowed."" Unfortunately, as they pass by the Parasite's cell, the Parasite manages to absorb some of Superman's power remotely and breaks free.

Vignette 4: Superman reveals to Lois that he's dying and takes the bottle city of Kandor to a remote planet, leaving the Earth for a few weeks. When he gets back, he finds that matters have changed and that Earth has new ""protectors,"" a couple of astronauts from Krypton who were lost in space for decades. They have a decidedly different idea on how to behave, a belief that might makes right, that Earthmen are little more than apes, and that Superman is a deluded, ineffectual dreamer. Their goal is to create a new Krypton and if that means getting rid of everyone on Earth, then so be it. The vignette ends abruptly as the pair find that they are dying. They repent their arrogance as Superman sends them to the Phantom Zone until a cure can be found for them.

Vignette 5: Superman visits Luthor in prison but Luthor remains unrepentant. Luthor is subsequently sent to the electric chair but he has a surprise for his captors, as he has imbibed a 24-hour super serum of his own, a serum he stole from Superman's fortress. Luthor has made a bargain with Solaris, a stellar super-computer from the future who eats suns. Solaris has put himself between the sun and the Earth, turning the sun's rays red to de-power Superman. Unfortunately for Solaris, Superman has a baby sun-eater. Between Superman and the sun-eater, Solaris is defeated.

Meanwhile, back on earth, Luthor is taking advantage of his super-powers to attack Metropolis. A dying Superman takes him on but is overpowered by Luthor. Superman has one final trick up his sleeve, though, as he speeds up Luthor's clock, so that the 24-hour serum expires in just a couple of hours. Unfortunately for everyone, Solaris had double-crossed Luthor, and has turned the sun blue. Only one person can halt that chain reaction, as Superman, now visibly showing the signs of his affliction, flies off to perform one final (?) heroic deed.

I have to confess that I'm not a big fan of the original source material. Luthor's plot was an interesting idea but the various vignettes don't really hang together and some of them just strike me as rather silly. The movie is relatively faithful to the original source material, although a few stories were omitted (a Bizarro story, a Jimmy Olsen story where Superman is exposed to Black Kryptonite and Olsen has to turn himself into Doomsday to stop him, a story where he teams up with future Superman to take on the Chronovore); the only problem it is that they had to compress the stories down to make them fit.

The animation is pretty good and so are the voice actors. Nobody really stands out as exceptional but there aren't any weak players here, either. As noted, the story just isn't that good and the ambiguous ending is really unsatisfactory. I really like the DC Universe movies from the Warner Brothers animation team but this is probably their weakest effort and I just can't recommend it.",1392076800,3,4290,4.851092896174864

This, based on his 12 issue 'out of continuity' series, which has so many ideas, it might take other writers a decade to think of them, is a brilliant adaptation of that comic.

4336708,5,B004EE30C8,"The Man of Steel is dying after receiving an extreme dose of solar radiation. Trying to live out his last days and wrap up all loose ends, he spends it with Lois and gives her a special serum that grants her superpowers for twenty-four hours. When unexpected twists and turns arise, the two must save Metropolis together. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor has plans of his own and when he gets his hands on the serum that granted Lois superpowers, he becomes as powerful as Superman.

Can the Last Son of Krypton stop his arch nemesis while also saving the Earth from a damaged sun before he perishes?

When I think of classic Superman, I think of this story. The reason is because this story involves all of the classic elements of Superman lore, everything from the basics like Lois Lane and Lex Luthor, all the way to the Fortress of Solitude, the bottle city of Kandor, a full array of superpowers--and in the case of this story, some new ones, which reminds me of the ""bonus"" powers portrayed in Superman IV (though they're not silly in this one like they were in that flick)--the Phantom Zone, Superman using not only his super brawn but also his super brains, Lois having superpowers (which has happened quite a lot in Supes's history--she's got a cool costume in this, by the way), and a ton more.

Based on the graphic novel by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, this flick asks the hard questions about Superman's mortality, if such a thing is possible, and if it is possible, then how would that possibly play out? Unlike Superman's death when the Man of Steel went up against Doomsday, this story isn't about a giant slugfest, but about a slow death caused by the very thing that gives Superman his powers: the sun. It's about him coming to terms with his own mortality and setting things in order before his final moment arrives.

One of the great things about these direct-to-DVD super flicks from DC is they're all stand-alone features based on a graphic novel and by being so, they also carry with it the same art style from the book. In this case, it's Frank Quitely's art animated. I admit it took a while for his art to grow on me. Perhaps because it's so simple and clean, yet by being that way, he's able to create some pretty realistic-looking superheroes. Seeing it animated like we do in this flick brings Superman et al. to life and makes this comic book fan very happy.

Out of all the Superman adaptations done thus far, All-Star Superman is one of the greats and gets high props for being an awesome animated flick with a great cast, great art direction, a great story and, most importantly, having the greatest hero of them all, one who's definitely an all-star: Superman.

The concept is great, but unfortunately, the execution was poor.  If I were to read the script, it would seem amazing, as it delves into several inner aspects of Superman's truly unique perspective of the world that have never been showcased before.  And then I might think it would be difficult to adapt into an animation.  Sure enough, the directing was found wanting.  It had all the elements of a good flick, but it just lacked all the potential magic that an animation has over a bare script.  Even the voice actors somehow seemed to lack life in their lines.

Subplots includes Lois Lane (Catherine Hendricks) temporarily becoming a Superwoman, and Lex Luthor temporarily becoming superman.

While I haven't read the source material I can tell you that this animated overview story of Clark Kent/ Kal El is a flash-in-the-pan flipbook approach to an absolutely huge story and the quickness of the tale, with a slightly sad Superman, robs it of its emotional depth and of its appeal.  The animation is great, the central idea of Superman giving himself over as an ultimate sacrifice to get Lex Luthor see the error of his ways and use his genius to better the world, is a great one.  There is just too much stuffed into this 75"" feature so that the movie cannot do the themes the justice they deserve.

4336730,2,B004EE30C8,"All-Star Superman is the second animated Superman film in the DC animated movie lineup. Like with Superman Doomsday this movie had much potential. However, like Superman Doomsday, I do not think the movie really lived up to that potential. When I first watched the movie I did not care for it much at all. However, viewing it again, I liked more the second time, though I still think it is a bit of a lackluster film. I liked this film more than Superman Doomsday mainly because unlike Doomsday, this film did not ruin a story that I am a big fan of. I am not too familiar with the All-Star Superman comic. I only know what I have heard about it online.

This movie has many of the same issues that Superman Doomsday had. The pacing is too fast and things were changed or cut from original comic from what I've heard. All-Star Superman story, like the Death of Superman, is much too long to fit into an hour and fifteen minute movie. Plus, I found the film to be very boring during the middle half. The beginning and end of the film were exciting, but the middle portion nearly put me to sleep, especially when I first saw the movie.

I did not care much for the voices either. James Denton as Superman/Clark Kent is okay but nothing special. The same can be said for Christina Hendricks (Lois Lane), Anthony LaPlagia (Lex Luthor), and the rest of the cast.

The art of the movie took some getting used to, but after-a-while I grew accustomed to it. The animation is also very smooth. The art and animation are easily the best parts about the film. The action was also fairly entertaining. The action is not as explosive as Superman Doomsday's, but it is above average.

Overall this film, like Doomsday, is a film that does not live up to its potential. It is worth one viewing, but it is nothing you need to rush out and buy.",1370649600,,1827,4.41246290801187

This film is very different in detail but has the same character and themes.  It's a 4.5 star film, but I'll round up.

The pacing, especially in the opening scenes, is a touch slow as they introduce you to the world of a very experienced Superman.  Some of the relationships and characters seem flat, given the tiny amount of time they can afford to spend on them.
Despite this, the crew managed to create a world that moves on without Superman, but is forever changed by his actions.  The character arcs are rich, and the final scene with Lex is unique and satisfying.

The book is awesome and this movie does a great job of recreating the artwork and story. I've read reviews saying it's too scattered or there's parts that serve no purpose to the story but the book wasn't this graphic novel like say dark knight returns. It was an ongoing comic series, loosely linked with an overall story arch which eventually leads up to the death of Superman. Because of this it has great rewatch value. Finally the end. This movie's ending vastly surpasses the book's. Every once and awhile you get that. It's always refreshing. This is my second favorite movie of all time. Second only to Dark Knight Returns parts 1 and 2. ""I had parents that loved me. Good friends. I got to help people while living an incredible adventure.

4336746,4,B004EE30C8,"All-Star Superman is a pun on words.  Here's a hint: it involves Superman as a superstar and Superman as a super star, literally. In a carefully orchestrated Lex Luthor plot, Superman is manipulated into being overexposed to the sun's rays with a special kind of cancer unique to his physiology.  Superman is dying, and this animated film is an opportunity to look at Superman/Clark Kent's legacy.

With nothing to lose, Superman starts working on wrapping up loose ends.  He tells Lois whom he really is, a truth she doesn't believe for a second.  Being that this film is firmly rooted in the history of the Superman comics, it's easy to see why.  Clark Kent has been ""outed"" multiple times with dozens of excuses as to why he's not really Superman, such that even when Superman plainly states his secret identity it's no longer believable.  Nor is it really relevant in the big scheme of things.

What ""All-Star Superman"" does well is emphasize that Superman isn't an alien, but a god among men.  What does a god do in his spare time?  Collect dangerous but endangered alien creatures, synthesize super-power formulas, and rebuild the Titanic.  This is Superman as a comprehensive being who is both endlessly compassionate and terrifyingly powerful.  It's hard to conceive of Superman without his Clark Kent personality to ground him -- a fact brought into stark contrast by two Kryptonians who revel in their newfound power on Earth and carelessly abuse it.

There are other plots, led primarily by Luthor as an architect of destruction on death row that sees Superman's existence as an affront to humanity's destiny.  But it's not until Luthor truly gets a chance to walk in Superman's shoes that he sees the world as the Kryptonian sees it -- and realizes how much he has wasted his life in trying to thwart someone who has only tried to help.

Although ""All-Star Superman"" doesn't have the luxury of truly digging into every plot point (there are two time travel superbeings who show up that feel out of sync with the rest of the film's tone) it culminates in a critical question: When you can witness the suffering of even the smallest blade of grass, wouldn't you do everything in your power to ease it?

Luthor -- and by extension, all of mankind -- realizes only too late how pitifully short we fall of our noblest goals thanks, in part, due to the limited perceptions of our humanity. This is powerful stuff.",1361836800,,2419,4.764988009592326

The primary reason I didn't connect is that movies worth watching need more time to develop (especially one that attempt serious subject matter). Big reveals are meaningless when there's no time to let them sink in, and react naturally. How can you seriously appreciate anything with rushed progression?

That being said I think this is one of the very best DCAU movies to date. I didn't think I'd like the look of this movie (felt the preview art was soft, etc), but quickly took to it and the voice acting was excellent (including the first Lois Lane I liked that wasn't Dana Delany). Overall, in good company with Under the Red Hood, BB Return of Joker, JL Doom, and Wonder Woman.

I would have loved to see how Dwayne McDuffie could handle the subject with more time, but considering WB seems to find little merit in the storytelling benefits of longer DCAU features, this will be a about as good as they get. Recommended.",1335657600,9,1096,4.7631578947368425

4336769,4,B004EE30C8,"If you ever wondered how Superman could possibly die?  If he did die, what would happen to his essence? Is it possible for Superman to have children?  Would Lex Luthor ever use his intellect for the good of humanity?  Who would write Superman's obituary for the Daily Planet?  Would the meek and mild reporter named Clark Kent perform a heroic act?

All Star Superman answers those questions and many more.  It is a love story.  It's a hero story with some nasty villains besides Alexander Joseph Luthor.

The main story takes place on Lois Lane's birthday where Superman whisks her off to the Fortress of Solitude.  There she discovers more about Superman and Clark Kent.

The Fortress is a museum, workshop, laboratory and most of all a homage to an ancient planet known as Krypton.  This hermitage is where Superman pursues his various interests and vocations.  Except for his robot helpers it is a lonely, isolated place.

Perhaps this is the core of the film--Superman's unique loneliness and isolation.  Growing up in Smallville he had his earth parents and special friends like Lana and Pete.  In Metropolis he had Jimmy and Lois, but all in all Superman's existence was a lonely plight of a strange visitor from another world untouched by humanity's mortality.

The various battles, the inspiring music and the sad overtones of a demi-god facing his end are wrapped into a neat package.  The poignant conversation between Superman and Lois about their genetic incompatibility is touching.

The conversation between Clark and Lex as they fight for survival in a prison riot reveals how Lex feels about Clark and how Clark feels about Lex.  Lex and Superman could have been great friends.

There are many elements in this film as well as many characters.  Bottom line: it's a great story if you look pass certain plot and voice nuances.

The ending leaves one speechless and saddened, but a special book holds the promise.  It is that promise which makes what went before easier to accept--that the cosmos has a plan for its special beings, its protectors of planets.",1328486400,5,2073,4.876790830945558

OK voice acting, nothing that gets the viewer involved (no interesting dialog, not much emotion besides saying the lines. 2. Superman and Lex characters are very weak, no real tension. 3. Story lines feels fragmented, too many things going on, which can be left out and dedicated to the central story line. 4. Central story line is also weak, with one of the weakest ending, not at all satisfactory to the viewer's expectation, no real conclusion.

Having own just about all the DC movie collections, this one is probably near the bottom of my list, just right above the Superman/Shazam The Return of Black Adam. Good thing I saw it on Netflix first, didn't even buy that dvd.

I have to say, DC have been going down hill with the last few releases. I'm not a die hard fan but enjoys the super-hero genre from any vendor. DC - good animation quality (used to), Marvel - good live-action movies (recent releases).",1327276800,4,1046,4.588235294117647

4336775,1,B004EE30C8,"I'm a huge comic book fan and a big fan of big and small screen adaptations of comic book heroes. A couple weeks ago I almost bought this movie to add to my collection. Boy am I glad I didn't. While the animation was fine, the voice acting was some of the worst I can remember. The actors who played Lois and Superman had very generic voices. Not only were they generic sounding, but also emotionless, which gave much of the dialogue an unintentionally creepy feel. James Denton particularly sounded like he was imitating HAL 9000 for 2001 a Space Odyssey.

Aside from the voice acting, All Star Superman had a lot more wrong with it With so many competing plots it fealt like I was watching a medly of scenes from a dozen unrelated episodes of a Superman cartoon. And some of what was on screen just seemed silly. In one scene Superman is using old fashioned blacksmith tools to work on a miniature sun. Then there's Lex Luthor who, despite being on death row, gets to build devices in a special prison lab, work out in an olympic style gym, enjoy visitors, and generally wander around while escorted by 4 terrified armed guards. Seriously...? Even in the DC univere, event with Eric Holder as attorney general, would anyone really allow a super-villian on death row to wander around prisons and build scientific devices that can be used as weapons?

Then there's the time travelling strong men who want to challange Superman to a contest of strength (winner gets to keep Lois Lane). And finally there are reptile men who live in the Earth's core, that look so silly I expected Space Ghost to make a cameo appearence. All in all...the worst Superhero movie since Superman Returns.",1322697600,6,1681,4.6375838926174495

And surprisingly, it was very good though I still consider New Frontier and Under the Red Hood best of the bunch.

The animation was very good, though I'm used to how Parasite looked from the animated series rather than how he appears here. The story feels very episodic, almost reminding me of Gotham Knight but that movie's story was all over the place, while still maintaining continuity. But I feel they could've dropped the bit with the other Kryptonians. They add nothing to the story except a brief obstacle to overcome after Superman left to find a new home for the city of Kandor. Though I'm sure the comic handles this a lot better than what the movie could (I've never read it), stringing together separate issues of a storyline vs. one that had a straight-forward one (Under the Red Hood or Doomsday) could prove difficult if not handled correctly (which this was). It just felt like the movie ended one bit (like with Samson and Atlas) and picked up on the next part (which was Clark visiting Luthor in prison I think).

The voice casting was fantastic! Though to be honest, I've never heard of James Denton (Clark Kent/Sueprman), Christina Hendricks (Lois Lane) or Anthony (I hope I spelled that right) Lapalgia (Lex Luthor) but all were very good, second only to the actors from the animated series, and were much better picks, I think, than the actors who voiced them in Doomsday.

I feel that the people behind these films did a far better job here than the last film but not everything can be A+ material.",1320537600,3,1801,4.639498432601881

Directed by Sam Liu

Producers Bruce Timm and Bobbie Page, Co-producer Alan Burnett and screenwriter Dwayne McDuffie, brings writer Grant Morrison's graphic novel to the screen with great animation. Voice acting is quite good pulling panels and pages and inserting into this animated movie.

Being a fan of animation regardless if DC or Marvel, love when each reintroduces characters from the GOLDEN AGE OF COMICS.  Film was quite good considering the area it must cover in this 76 minute adaptation, just couldn't fit the entire novel. cause they only have so much time.

Superman shows he's just as smart as Lex, which in some comics it is not shown...good to see it in this story.  You can see that he connects with the rest of the world, showing why Superman is so well received on this planet.  Great scene with Superman and Martha Kent (his Mother) --- Lois Lane plays her character as an equal to Superman, when she receives special powers from her MAN OF STEEL.

The graphic novel on which its based was a hit (though I really don't know why.)This video tries to mimic the graphic novel's art work which was boring, then throws in useless characters and odd unrelated actions (Jimmy Olsen in drag for no reason?) WTF?? Some of the fighting action was very good, I'll give it that, but the story line (or lack there of) is what killed it for me. Not even sure what to make of some of this huge turd of a movie. A lot of it could have been cut out like the whole Atlas and his buddy, and the necklace and the riddle. Seriously? How did that advance the story? Also the two people from Krypton (wearing the most ridiculous outfits I have ever seen) also could have been cut out as well and...no one would have noticed. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!

No other Superman film has ever captured the essence of Superman as well; nor has Lex Luthor ever been portrayed nearly this well.  Never has Lex Luthor's obsession over defeating Superman been portrayed on film nearly this well, or how it has blinded him to all other reason.  Never has Superman's belief that maybe someday Luthor can get over his jealousy and finally do the right thing.  Many other films simply have Lex Luthor as the bad guy who wants to destroy the world, and Superman as the only person who can stop him, which does not do either character justice.

A few of the events were fairly unnecessary to the entire storyline, but were still entertaining enough.  I will still give it a 5 stars.",1314662400,3,766,4.595588235294118
4336783,3,B004EE30C8,"Allow me, for the sake of justifying my complaints about this piece from the onset, to say that I am a subscriber to the theory that the DCAU crew is responsible for the absolute best incarnations of the DC comic characters of all time.  Whenever I begin to burn out on the whole animated comic hero industry, a trip to my Batman the Animated Series collection or through a few Justice League Unlimited episodes are all it takes to remind me of everything that is right about the concept of turning static comic panels into animated life.

That said, I've noticed many of the crew responsible for the aforementioned properties (Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, the late Dwayne McDuffie and company) have since shifted gears from weekly serial production to animated feature film work exclusively.  While a few of these features have been pretty darn impressive (I enjoyed Batman: Under the Red Hood, Superman/ Batman Public Enemies and Justice League Crisis on Two Earths to mention a few) but All Star Superman is one of the oddest animated films I've encountered, DCAU or otherwise, in quite some time.

All-Star Superman, on which this picture is based, is a twelve-issue comic book series featuring Superman that ran from November 2005 to October 2008. The series was written by Grant Morrison, drawn by Frank Quitely, digitally inked by Jamie Grant and published by DC Comics.

The film incarnation is actually the tenth in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies line released by Warner Premiere and the first in the line that is rated PG (as opposed to the usual PG-13 rating).

The plot goes like this: Dr. Leo Quintum and his P.R.O.J.E.C.T. Team are exploring the Sun when they are sabotaged by a booby-trapped, genetically enhanced Lex Luthor clone. Superman saves the doomed crew, but it turns out that in the process has been overdosed with radiation that, while responsible for increasing his power initially, is actually slowly killing him. Luthor, having orchestrated the death of Superman while under the employment of General Sam Lane, is arrested thanks to Clark Kent's article and sentenced to death.

Playing off the unique angle of the arch nemeses responsible for the inevitable death of the other, there is a lot of potential in this plot structure.  Sadly, I felt as though the delivery of these ideals never manages to live up to the possibilities.

For starters, this 76-minute film suffers from the undeniable feeling of trying to fit entirely too many key moments from the 12-issue book run into a little over an hour's worth of narrative.  As expected, this mash of plot threads often comes off as completely disconnected from one another.  Characters appear frequently, do something completely contrived, then vanish for the duration of the film.  Detours like Superman's encounter with Samson and Atlas and even the Kryptonian scientists will leave even the most diehard fans of the franchise scratching their heads in ""what in the world was that?"" theatrics.

These threads work out in the books on which this film is based simply because they are given due time to develop.  Perhaps had they been integrated here more subtly earlier on and allowed to play out in the background to the seriousness of the larger issues at hand, they may have worked out here as well.  Instead they come off as unnecessary plot devices.

However, in all fairness there are a few qualities here that prevent this one from sinking like a cinder block.  Among these are the opportunity to witness Frank Quitely's bright crisp art work come to animated life and a modern take on the Lois Lane character.

In all though the end result here is quite a muddled mess.  The story itself is interesting and arguably tragic enough to warrant looking into the mini-series but the film will most certainly under-whelm both fans of the books and of past DCAU efforts alike.",1314489600,24,3867,4.903374233128834

4336785,5,B004EE30C8,"I am writing this review to just clarify something to a lot of the people that didn't understand about the idea of the All Star Superman. It has to be understood that this is a stand alone series that is supposed to encapsulate Superman as a whole mythos, as opposed to being just a single battle or story from the main continuity. Which is why some people are confused as to why there are characters that aren't fully developed or segments that seemed short. Its because they aren't full stories of their own, but are supposed to reveal an different aspects of Superman that the whole series is trying to reveal. An example is when Clark interviews Lex in prison, it could have been a whole 20 min fight scene but is written to reveal the complexities of trying to maintain the Clark Kent persona while saving everyone (including Lex).

With those ideas in mind, watching it is much more enjoyable because you don't worry about a antagonist and how Superman will beat him like in every other story, but you get what Lois is given early on, a look into the life and complexities of being Superman. That being said, I give this 5 stars based on the risk taken producing something thats is beyond just a cookie cutter story of good guy fights bad guy and wins in the end and actually turning out a enjoyable product.",1313625600,2,1314,4.497907949790795

There was so much here that it would have made more sense to turn it into a full-fledged season of a TV show or a longer mini-series at least.  I don't want to get into spoilers, so I will simply say there are definite breaking points throughout that could have been developed into full-fledged features on their own.

""But the rest of it turned out to be quite conventional. It wasn't even a satisfying ending since you don't actually see the big moment, so to speak:  there's all sorts of room for back-pedaling on the finality of that.  Even worse, all the adventures leading up to the ending were quite random and seemingly disconnected.

""Near the beginning, right after Superman said something like ""the radiation"" has increased my curiosity!  I just want to read and learn!""  I was thinking that that was why you had recommended it for someone like me:  in other words, that Superman, driven by desire to knowledge, was going to sit around in the Fortress of Solitude reading philosophy while Metropolis burned.

All-Star Superman on Blu-Ray looks fantastic!  The score is pretty good, the voice acting is really good, and the animation is just plain incredible.  The problem with the film is that it does not live up to its premise.  Early in the film it is stated that prior to his death, Superman will perform his most incredible feats yet.  While the feats were remarkable, he has done much better in his decades of existence.  However, the biggest problem with the movie is its pacing.  It is simply a roller coaster that should have been re-designed before coming into service.  The fun parts do not last long enough and the needless parts/exposition last far too long.  There are simply too many battles without any proper build-up for us to even care.

Despite these complaints, the pros vastly outweigh the cons.  While this may not be Superman's greatest adventure, it is definitely worth watching.",1311552000,,922,4.883870967741935
4336789,1,B004EE30C8,"I think I clicked ""thumbs up"" on every single 1 star reviewers' review.

I was watching this movie and several times caught myself thinking, ""What the crap does this have to do with the story? Who are these guys? Where is this going?  What's the point of this?""

All of those questions swirling through my head like turds in a toilet, which culminated into a clogged drain of boredom and indifference and the ONLY ANIMATED MOVIE FROM DC THAT I EVER JUST TURNED OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF.

Wait, does Invincible Ironman count?  No no that's Marvel.

Anyways there was absolutely nothing ALL*STAR about this film.  The plot line is incoherent, the characters are just plain boring.  Nothing seems to come together, like a stretch of puzzle whose pieces don't connect, but you try to get away with just stacking the edges over each other and hope they look ok.  Well it doesn't look ok.  It looks like a crappy puzzle.

Man I'm really nailing it with the analogies in this review.  Too bad i have no more left.  I don't care that this came from a series of comic books, it's not worth watching.",1311033600,3,1086,4.507692307692308

Now after seeing what a huge disappointment Superman Doomsday was, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about All Star Superman.  But wow what an incredible movie.  Lex Luthor is the main antagonist in this movie and he really tests Superman.  This is making me want the next DC animated movie to be a Superman one.  I recommend you read the comic this is based off of.  I read it once I had gotten the movie and that was one of the best comics I've read.  Two thumbs up and five stars here.

4336791,5,B004EE30C8,"This is quite a two disc set!

Disc one has the main story, All Star Superman.  Superman and Luthor clash when Luthor plans to give Superman cancer.  This does not stop Supes from making it all go right in saving the planet.

Several points of interest:  He wants to do a few things before he dies so he gives Lois Lane a super serum so she has powers for 24 hours.  He has a hard time revealing his true identity as she says ""great that you impersonated Clark.""  Hilarious.

Another point is the Fortress of Solitude -- a doctor friend of his grants it that name.  A key that ways many tons and it's under a floor mat!

Finally, his run-in with Kryptonian astronauts that want to save the world from the ""human apes"" but then discover the minerals in their bodies are turning into kryptonite.  This is new from Morrison.  I never heard of that possibility though it makes sense.  These two are never saved either, but are placed into the Phantom Zone.  That part of the story ended quietly but no further development.

The ending was a bit  of a puzzle to me, as Luthor hands over the genetic code of Superman.  Were they planning on making a new Superman?  Ends on a question rather than give more answers but that can be satisfying to some.

And whatever happened to Kandor?  Superman stated he found a planet for it to colonize, but they left that plot hole open.

I did enjoy Superman's run-in with Samson and Atlas and Superman's handling of the unaswerable question of the Sphinx.  Smart guy!

Disc two has its positive points too.  Two episodes, parts one and two, ""Blasts from the Past"" about the discovery by a professor of the Phantom Zone and in his experiments finds a woman there who has said her time is up and that she should be released.  But when Superman in his kind-hearted way releases her, Marta finds she has powers and that there is no reason why she cannot rule Earth.  She releases Jax-Ur, another mad scientist and military genius and off we go!  This animated feature reminds me a lot of the original movie Superman II and the release of Kryptonians.

Why is it that whenever we meet Kryptonians that they want to take over the planet?

Some features that I enjoyed included the interviews with Grant Morrison and Dan Didio as well as the previews for Superman/Batman Apocalypse and Green Lantern Emerald Knights.  These are actually ""sneak peeks"" that don't have the animation in place, but do have the rough sketches and voice actors going through the paces.  I always liked original art and this is no exception.

The interviews with the producers and writers are really interesting as well.  What is their mind-set?  This is what I like best about Bruce Timm and his intentions and how that translates into animation.

And the Emerald Knights interviews and sketches is great fun.  Arisia is the new GL and she's learning about all these stories and new characters in her first visit to Oa, complete with stories about Kilowogg, the martial arts expert Laira and a great Mongo story!

The overall package is a five star package, though the All Star Superman main event didn't really end well for me, despite being very entertaining and in line with the original comics series.

4336792,3,B004EE30C8,"I had already read All-Star Superman in both serial and collected form , so I had some high expectations for this cartoon adaptation. I thought the Warner Animation team made wise choices on what elements to include or exclude from author Grant Morrison's 12-issue epic. The only way to shoot All-Star Superman frame-by-frame from the source material would have been to produce a mini-series and that wasn't going to happen.

Plot-wise, the last labours of Superman intermixed with interactions with Lois Lane, the Daily Planet staff, and Lex Luthor worked quite well. Unfortunately, I didn't think the cartoon sold the emotive aspects at all. I realize it's impossible to transfer artist Frank Quitely's human figure style to the screen, but it's up to the animation professionals to ""ham it up"" and communicate the intense feelings of the characters. They nailed the subdued portrayals and perhaps that's why James Denton's vocals of Superman were so flat - the Warner Animation team wanted it that way.

In summary, I thought enough worthy elements were lifted from Morrison's comic saga to make watching the cartoon enjoyable, but I docked a star because I thought the animators didn't adequately convey the pathos and intensity of Superman's journey.",1306800000,,1255,5.177339901477833
4336793,2,B004EE30C8,"Lets face it the comic movie adaptions have their winners and losers.  I'm a diehard superhero fan and have watched almost every movie series, tv series and more.  All Star Superman sorry folks, is a loser.  The voice overs ARE monotone and really just done seem to fit the animation or characters.  I feel like I am listening to the voices in a muffled office cubicle more than characters in a movie setting.  Doesn't compare close to the the Tim Daly/Kevin Conroy/Clancy Brown voices that have grown the franchise and become icons.  The premise itself is weak.  The story flow disjointed and the pace vague.  I was hoping for some hero hoopla with this movie.  I quietly turned it off halfway through.

The finest, recent, Superman movie is without question Superman/Batman Public Enemies. Hard hitting story line, unprecedented hero action with a compelling pace that keeps your undivided attention.  It's hero action (numerous heros I might add) at its finest when we want our momentary fix of capes, powers, gizmos and battles.  In any superhero movie the only limits should be the writer's imagination.  Not a Lois Lane that looks like she just walked out of a dance club and takes a ""magic potion"" to instantly become a superwoman.",1306108800,5,1238,4.866028708133971
4336794,5,B004EE30C8,"Not another half-baked retelling of the origin story, ""All-Star Superman"" is as good, and arguably better, than any of the live-action films.

With fewer ""stunt-guest"" voice talent than usual, the viewer can concentrate on the art and the story - and what a story. Superman is not pummelling his foes into submission as is distresingly typical in both the comics and many of the films (animated or otherwise). This is a much more thoughtful presentation in which real risks provide unusual tension and some remarkable plot development.

Whether or not you have read the comic on which this is based (longer, equally impressive and with many additional story arcs), if you have ever enjoyed Superman in any of his 70 years, I believe you will find this to be one of the best portrayals of the Man of Steel ever put together.

Hooray for Bruce Timm and his animation team, who do these things with such careful story development, not to mention loving care.",1305849600,,955,4.810975609756097
4336795,5,B004EE30C8,"Superman has been the focus of several movies, both animated and live-action. Although, almost none of them since Superman 2 has been able to capture the pure joy and out-of-this-world splendor of the comic books. Granted, Superman Returns was a great return to the idea of the original 70s-80s films, but still steered pretty clear of some of the main comic book ideals. However, as part of the DC Universe series of animated movies, it was decided to take one of the best maxi-series ever done of the Man of Steel and turn it into a great made-for-video production. All-Star Superman was originally one of two titles that DC Comics was doing as their answer to Marvel's line of Ultimate series that did a fresh modern day retake of existing characters without having to be familiar with decades with of backstory. The other comic done for this was All-Star Batman And Robin by Frank Miller & Jim Lee, but has been universally panned as being one of the worst comics about the Caped Crusaders ever made(and is still incomplete!), while the Superman one though took place seperately from that storyline in its own universe and dealt with an updated version of the super-science Supes from the 50s. Grant Morrison of X-Men and JLA fame, and drawn by Frank Quietly who is currently doing Batman And Robin(not the All-Star one).

The movie starts out with billionaire scientist Dr. Quinton(an original character from the book)who is in jeopardy as his spaceship is in danger of crashing into the sun after Lex Luthor has rigged one of his clone workers into sabotaging their star trek. Superman shows up and saves the ship, but his exposure to the sun's solar radiation has increased his strength and given him some new superpowers. The down side is that this is far beyond Superman's capability to process solar energy from Earth's yellow sun, which is what also gives him his powers. Realizing that he only has a short amount of time before this ""solar cancer"" eats away at him, he decides to take care of alot of things he's always meant to do. He reveals his secret identity to Lois Lane, and gives her a special 24-hour formula that gives her Kryptonian powers. While stopping an invasion from subterranean dinosaur man, they run across the original time-travelling heroes, Atlas and Samson, who Superman fends them off from trying to pick up Lois. Then, Clark Kent goes to interview Luthor in jail on death row, but the Parasite begins to mutate after being exposed to Superman's new power boost, and causes a prision riot. Clark learns that Luthor planned Superman's solar infection, so he resolve another of his longstanding issues by taking the shrunken city of Kandor to another planet far out in space. Superman returns two months later to discover that Earth has been visited by a couple from Krypton. They tried to influence the Earthlings at first and plan on taking over, but unfortunately succumb to Kryptonite poisoning, so Superman sends them to the Phantom Zone where they won't be affected by Kryptonite. Superman then begins writing his final journal, but the Earth is invaded by the evil artificial sun Solaris. It turns Earth's sun blue, and Superman and his army of robots take him down. While this is happening, Luthor makes his own version of Lois' super-formula, and breaks out of prision. Superman uses a special gravity gun to speed up Lex's 24 hours. Just as Superman's body is about to give into the solar energy he's absorbed, he heads out into the sun to repair the damage that Solaris has caused. In the wake of Superman's apparent death, Luthor give Dr. Quinton the means to create a Superman clone that Lois would give birth to.

All-Star Superman is definatley so far the best adaptation of a comic story amoung the DC Universe movies. There were a few things from the original comic left out, like the Smallville and Bizarro chapters, but it was pretty spot-on with the rest of it, even though Luthor's redemption at the end was slightly tagged on. The late Dwayne McDuffie wrote the screenplay for this, and it was produced Bruce Timm. James Denton from Desperate Houswives plays a very sympathetic Superman, and Anthony LaPaglia brings the megalomania back to Luthor in a slick way. The animation is really top notch, and up there with theatrical quality. For only even the passing Super-fan, this splendid sci-fi spectacular is an epic look into the life of a hero and his impact on the world he leaves behind.",1305763200,,4448,4.8054830287206265

It has a great, unique story concerning Superman's pending ""death"", due to Lex Luthor's machinations,  and the things he does and reflections he has on his life on Earth as a heroic protector and his legacy. Like the comic book storyline, this film has a big heart and goes a great way in revealing the humanity that has always been the cornerstone of Superman. He's not just a hero because he has to be, but because he wants to be...and thats the nobility he carries, and it inspires those around him. Anthony LaPaglia does a good job bringing a sense of malice to his vocalization of Luther. James Denton has been criticized for his seemingly lackluster portrayal of The Man of steel, but I thought he did a very credible job bringing him to life, and Christina Hendricks is fine as Lois Lane.

4336804,3,B004EE30C8,"First, let me state my perspective. I am not a big comics fan, although I was as a boy. So I know nothing about the official Superman canon, nor of any story lines or character changes, other than what gets reported in the news. I don't know the artists and writers, and I'm not going to read a trade paperback. I am just a guy who likes animation for the freedom it allows the storytellers, and who likes a good story.

All-Star Superman falls flat for me. First off, that whole Samson and Atlas detour served absolutely no purpose. It did not advance the story in a significant way, nor did it provide any significant insight into the characters of Superman or Lois Lane. I use the ""significant"" qualifier because it did do a little bit of each, but not enough for the amount of time spent. The reviewers who identified this flaw are absolutely spot on.

Nor did I love the appearance of yet more Kryptonian survivors. Seriously, DC? That's almost as hackneyed as ""It was a dark and stormy night""!

Having said that, I must say that otherwise, All-Star Superman would have been a good effort.  With the exception of the Samson/Atlas business, this was no mere meat-headed fistfight between super-powered beings; it was a  thoughtful exploration of what would Superman do if he knew he was dying.

By way of comparison, I would suggest viewing Superman: Apokalypse, or Batman: Under the Red Hood. Each of those had a good mix of action, character development, plot, and yes, pathos. I believe that the success of characters like Batman and Spiderman is due to their having to carry some heavy burdens, baggage which goes far to offset the coolness of their skills and abilities. Superman as depicted in Smallville gets this, and I think this animated Superman is getting there.

So, go ahead and watch All-Star Superman; as I write this, it is being carried at my local Redbox, so you can rent it rather than buy it. Just don't hold it to a very high standard.",1302048000,4,1961,4.617816091954023

this movie soars with sucha abundant synergy of intelligence and sophistication, somewhat laking in the live-movie superman return, but also showing us a deeply connected with human emotions type of storyline that will be enough to warrant repeat viewings....

This is, in my opinion, the worst DC animated film to come out of their franchise.

While I can learn to appreciate the new voices and the new illustrated 'look' for the characters, what I don't get is how the foundation - the story itself - could be so botched.

It's like Director Liu couldn't decide what was essential and hedged his bet by incorporating *everything* - throwing it all into a pot and hoping something good would come out. It wasn't and it didn't.

By incorporating four different mini-stories using a weak thread to tie them together, Liu essentially derailed the project. Instead of a steady, strong build-up to an unspeakable climax - we're left grateful that the blended mishmash was finally over.

Example:

What's the point of the entire Atlas and Samson sub-plot? Watching something that has NOTHING to do with what Superman is dealing with - to prove what? That he's stronger than the two egocentric arrogant jackwads? And if this was a display for Lois Lane that she ""picked"" the right guy - seriously - that's a huge insult to her character. That she needs convincing at this point about her love suggests she's a weak silly skank willing to take off with any super strong knucklehead that passed her way. Really?

And hey, guess what, another bunch of Kyptonians survived the death of their planet, made their way to Earth and tried to conquer it. Inane retread anyone?

Shockingly, we aren't able to feel connected to anything, despite our collective investment in the characters we know so well. What should've been A Grand Testament to Ol' Supes is instead turned into a weak soap opera-ish melodrama.

It was not a good idea to compress Morrison's 12 issue maxi-series that ran for almost 3 years into a movie. Watching this movie you miss out on a lot UNLESS you have already read the series. 76 minutes is no where near enough time to even grasp this new vision of Superman.

4336808,4,B004EE30C8,"I wasn't so sure about buying this one because the reviews I read were not very flattering.... Make no mistake this is a very good adaptation of Grant Morrison's and Frank Quietly series so If you are wondering whether you will like it or not, at least browse the comics.  If you like the comics chances are you are going to enjoy the movie, if not, please don't even watch the movie because as movie goes... Its a good comic book adaptation.
The comic was written by Grant Morrison, who happens to be famous for his complex out of the box story telling, so the comic is complex and pulls the superman lore to that complexity. The comic is not your typical Superman story, so the movie IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL SUPERMAN MOVIE.
Both the movie and the comic occur outside normal comic book continuity and revolve around the premise of Superman dying. Specifically, they try to answer the question: What would the Man of Steel do if he knew that he was dying from some weird decease?
As any of us would do if dying from a conical decease, Superman says his goodbyes and make preparations for the last trip, so the movie will be ""episodic"" as the series was (in the series we saw Superman taking care of a different issue with each episode or couple of episodes of the series).
That does not help for the flow or the rhythm of the movie, but doesn't make it a bad one.
Animation is really quite good on its own style (which tries to emulate Frank Quietly's art in the comics) but don't be expecting anime like quality or drawings. Again, browse the comics to see if you like Mr. Quietly's style because although I love it, many people hate it... Beware.
Now... the movie is only 70 minutes long so not everything that happens in the comic will appear on screen. However, if you liked the comic you will like the movie.  That I guarantee.",1301443200,2,1828,4.421364985163205
4336809,5,B004EE30C8,"This movie takes 7 of the 12 comic book episodes and creates a spell-bounding poetic story, that Superman deserves. Sticking 95% true to every word of dialogue. It's almost as if the comic was the story board for this film (ie.it is the story board for the movie). True fans of the comic will really feel the loving detail that was taken to preserve as much as possible from the original comic book all the way down to the very frame of the very comic it is based on. Author Grant Morrison's bonus feature commentary on this Blu-ray film is very intuitive with regards how he feels about this adaptation of this film. Grant Morrison gives it a 5 out of 5 stars in his commentary with Bruce Tim (ie. so that should be enough to satisfy any lover of Grant Morrison writing). So you can't beat the rating of the author himself.

The art style fairly closely captures Frank Quitely's art, not perfect but near to it. (obviously nobody can beat the actual illustrator himself he has is own unique style but the animators do achieve a similar style that you can see they took all design from Frank Quitely).

Dialogging is ripped directly out of the comic book bubbles with a little cutting and adjustments in two scenes so that the film can flow better in a 80 minute period. Though I do wish the film kept every single panel of the comic and to extend the film out to 2 hours and 30 minutes but hey this is a direct to DVD feature. So for that alone the retaining of story dialog and comic book frames should make this to be considered the best DC animated feature ever made.

In my opinion there is the Richard Donnor Superman Film and All Star Superman on the top of my Superman movie rating love 5 out of 5 stars all the way. If you have a problem about my rating too bad because Grand Morrison is the king of comic book writing and this film is the best film adaptation of any of his work ever made into movies period.

Andrea Romano who is known as the best voice actor director in the industry, totally dropped the ball on this one.

I am sure there was more material in the 12 issue run of the series (It is not a Graphic Novel! It was a mini-series. Get it right people) and things needed to be cut for a 75 min. movie. But some events in the movie just seem silly or pointless to have in there. It is bad writing to add a random line of ""Robot 7 is malfunctioning."" And then 40 min. later say ""I expected something was wrong when Robot 7 was malfunction."" Maybe show Robot 7 doing in between or mention it in between. This is just being lazy to try to cover all your tracks in a short amount of time given.

Keeping with the tradition of sticking with the source material, we get see what Frank Quitely's artwork would look like animated. Not being a fan of his interior work, all the character and set designs was an eyesore, but on a plus, at least none of the characters had the facial structures of a toad. This is something to be expected from the DCUA movies. Superman/Batman: Public Enemies had Ed McGuinness' artwork and think it was across the board nobody was impressed with what they saw visually. But then again Superman/Batman: Apocalypse had Michael Turner's art style and that was beyond amazing and beautiful.

For people concerned whether Grant Morrison's material could be adapted due to his very bizarre but unique writing style, do not fret. All-Star Superman was easily transferred to this new medium. It is just ashamed that this was one was done over many other great stories, and was done so quickly, instead of the proper time to be perfected.

All-Star Superman following the comic by the same name (loosely but since it is a short animated film they have to do so) is the latter. It shows Superman as he should be shown as a Godlike being. The film is beautifully animated and perfectly voiced and really captures the essence of the comics and shows superman how he should be shown, a super-powered, perhaps over-powered being that is so powerful it strikes awe in everyone.

It is a throwback story to the Silver Age Superman and so must be viewed in light of that. There are several scenes throughout the movie that are utterly ridiculous unless you decide to go ahead and enjoy the style of the Silver Age of comics. Because the story is so long and there is so much to fit into such a short time frame, it can feel a little forced and fast paced. There are a lot of secondary characters that arrive and leave in short periods of time. There isn't a lot of action like the previous Bruce Timm movies, but the overall story is told so well that I did not miss it. It's not what I was expecting, but it is a very good movie and I would recommend it for anyone who likes comics, superheroes, Superman, or just enjoys a good throwback style movie.",1300665600,2,873,4.265060240963855

And, honestly, I find the source material extremely overrated, to the point where I doubted I could write an unbiased review. But, I am absolutely floored with the end result, it's actually good!

That said, the film has a few missteps.  James Denton plays a honest sounding Superman and that's good. Lois lane, played by Christina Hendrix, is so light and easy going that it's almost unbelievable. Then, Anthony LaPaglia as Lex Luthor has too deep a voice. Those are just my opinions on how they sound, performance wise, they're flawless. I don't like the writing in the source material, but when the cast speaks it, I find it genuine.

Also, part of my gripes with the voices are tied into the animation. At the beginning of the movie, Luthor says he's getting old, but you can't see it in anybody's face. Clearly, Superman has been around for 10-20 years, but everyone still looks like they're in their mid-30s. Lois isn't that shocked when things happen around her, because it's implied that it happens all the time, but she doesn't look like she's been doing it for years.

On the positive side, I know I'm not the only one who thinks Frank Quietly makes people look puffy and fat. That's all been fixed in the animation. One-third of the Graphic Novel is cut out (Doomsday, Time Travel, the Bizarros), and what they kept boiled down to it's essentials. Unfortunately, if you cut it down to the story of Superman, Lois, and Luthor, it wasn't enough for the film, so they kept the Kryptonian Astronauts.  They leave almost as quickly as they show up, but at least they try to tie into the theme of the story.

From looking at other critical reviews, I thought I was going to hate this movie. I wasn't just ""pleasantly surprised,"" this movie left me energized. It made me feel good. By itself, All Star Superman is a solid 4, but what makes it perfect are the extras.

Commentary with Grant Morrison and Bruce Timm. And, yes, Morrison is in love with the movie, and I'm happy to see them bring back commentary tracks.

""Incubating the Idea"" is a 10-minute piece with Grant Morrison, the writer of the Graphic Novel, showing his initial concept drawings of what would become All-Star Superman from back in the late 90s.

""Superman Now"" is a 30-minutes of Grant Morrison going on about his approach to Superman, and going over parts of All-Star Superman. Clearly, a lot of heart went into the creation of the book.

Sneak Peek at Green Lantern: Emerald Knight. Looks good, and slight hints they might adapt the Sinestro Corps War one day.

Two Episodes of Superman the Animated Series, Blast from the Past parts 1 & 2, which is a nice parallel to the Kryptonian Astronauts.

A ""virtual comic book"" version of All-Star Superman #1. This means the comic book shows up on your TV screen. I didn't like it.

And trailers for Superman/Batman and Under the Red Hood pad out the disk.

So, for a really good adaptation, great animation and acting, and over-all a lot of heart, (I can't believe I'm saying this) I give All-Star Superman (on Blu-ray) a 5 out of 5.",1300665600,3,3324,4.860176991150443

They did tease with images of the future Supermen, however they never really followed through with that part of the story.  As a whole, It's good, and It's a nice translation of a comic book...

If you are human being who cares about those in your family or those around you like I do, you can't miss this film.  If I could nominate this film for an Oscar, I would.

The story begins with Superman saving some astronauts from going into earth's sun.  As usual he saves them from distruction.  However,Luthor has something terrible planned for him as a consequence.

The voice performances were excellent and unusually good for this special DVD release.  It was good to hear Ed Asner (Lou Grant from Mary Tyler Moore) as Perry White.  He did portray J.J. Jameson in the Spiderman cartoon of the 1990's.  It's too bad this wasn't a live action film.  The budget would have been well over the hundred million dollar mark.

The pace is fast, with an exceptionally large cast of unusual characters. But this is also a complex, meditative, and deeply emotional Superman story.

If you haven't seen it yet, I have two pieces of advice:
1. Do not read a synopsis of the story before you see it; give yourself the gift of NOT knowing where this story is going. Savor this one.

In the comics that these are adapted from, it spends time and space explaining who everyone is and why they are in the story, the movie unfortunatly either doesn't have time, or doesn't make time to explain anything.  There are things to like about it, Anthony LaPaglia is brilliant as Lex Luthor.  He brings a power and brilliance to the part that Lex needs.  The main story revolves around Lex's plot to kill Superman by poisoning him with over exposer to the sun.  This would be fine but then it meanders around with Lois Lane, 2 time traveling characters that aren't so much as introduced as dropped in out of nowhere.  Then after these two charcters are left behind, 2 more charcters are dropped in even more out of nowhere and then dropped out with even more bizare and rushed story telling.  Finally, Lex makes his long awaited move, battles Supes and Superman flyes off into the sunset. If they would have just stayed with the main story and fleshed that out, it may have been a good movie, or even a great movie but they chose to just try to stuff too many unrelated events into it and just call it a movie.

This video is a fairly decent adaptation of Grant Morrison's 12-issue limited series.  It's an ""Elseworlds"" story, which is DC speak for ""doesn't fit in with the current continuity of our characters.""  The plot lines up with the original series, with certain deletions.  Issue by issue, it goes like this:

1.  Save the sun ship
2.  Superman and Lois in the Fortress of Solitude
3.  Superman, Atlas, and Samson vs. the Lizard People
4.  Superman vs. Jimmy Olsen (deleted)
5.  Clark, Lex, and the Parasite
6.  The future Supermen (deleted)
7.  Bizarro world pt 1 (deleted)
8.  Bizarro world pt 2 (deleted)
9.  Superman vs. the Kryptonians
10.  Kandor and the microverse (deleted)
11.  Superman vs. the Tyrant Sun
12.  Superman vs. Lex

As far as the original comic series goes, one of the following must be true 1) it is the best Superman story ever told, 2) I have amnesia, or 3) I haven't read the best Superman story yet (I still don't have ""Superman: Secret Identity""  or ""Supeman for all Seasons"" yet). Even more than ""Watchmen"", even more than ""Dune"", I feel very strongly that you should not see this movie until after you have read the original series, because I believe it would ruin your appreciation of the original (see the 1 and 2 star reviews).

Why is this?  The story was told originally as a comic book, with nearly each issue being both a complete story, yet with themes and subplots running through it.  Each issue is in its way its own little movie.  Converting this directly into a movie doesn't quite work.  When in the movie you jump, for instance, from Superman kissing Lois goodnight to Lex Luthor on trial, you've just jumped from the last page of Issue #3 to the first page of issue #5.

Another problem with the movie is the essential unreality of it all.  Back in the ""Silver Age"" (the '50's and '60's) you would get a wacky plot like ""Lois Lane temporarily gets superpowers.  Atlas and Samson travel through time to compete with Superman for her affections.""  This could even be straight out of ""Lois Lane issue #53"" for all I know.  The genius of Grant Morrison is that he can take a wacky plot like this and make you believe it.  In the COMIC.  However, in the MOVIE, you just aren't going to buy it.  You aren't used to this.  You didn't grow up reading this kind of story, you don't see this on TV, they wouldn't even do it on a Saturday morning cartoon these days.

So, I'm cheating.  I really think this is worth about 3.2 stars.  The animation is okay, but not outstanding.  It does capture the feel of Frank Quietly's art, though.  The voice acting...well, how do they record these things?  Does each actor come in separately and record his/her dialogue and then leave?  It never feels as though the characters are actually talking to each other.  But, I'm rounding it up to 4 stars because I love the orginal series so much.  And with the 2 disc set you get a nice 30 minute bit with Grant talking about the comic.

4336830,3,B004EE30C8,"When Scottish writer Grant Morrison was invited to reboot the Superman franchise, making it more relevant for the 21st century, his vision became the foundation of a 12-issue Limited Edition collection, ""All-Star Superman"". On a positive note, after viewing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dcu-All-Star-Superman-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B004EE301O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dcu All-Star Superman (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, I'm looking forward to reading the series...but unfortunately, without having read them first, I found the video confusing, stilted, and surprisingly uninvolving, a disappointment after several terrific previous video entries.

The Bonus Feature, 'Superman Now', on Disc Two, is a must, to understand what Morrison (in a wonderful, if nearly incomprehensible brogue) was intending; the concept of using classic myths of solar-influenced Gods (such as Apollo and Helios) as an inspiration, and returning to the Man of Steel his nearly God-like powers of the 1950s-1960s (reversing the 1980s make-over, and attempt to 'humanize' him), is intriguing, if more than a bit retro, for a 'new' look. The idea does allow two elements I really enjoyed; Lex Luthor, complaining that, while HE gets older, Superman DOESN'T (an idea straight out of Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" that I always liked), and the concept that Supes could 'overchage' on solar radiation, increasing his powers dramatically, but inevitably resulting in an overdose that would kill him. Things, unfortunately, get pretty mixed-up, beyond this...

Supes tells Lois they could never have children, as their DNA is too different...but he possesses a 'future telescope', allowing him to chat with his descendents(?)...um, who was the female ancestor? Wonder Woman? Lex has an offspring (Nasthalthia)? And he LIKES Clark Kent, sort of? Fellow Kryptonians Lilo-El and Bar-El appear and disappear abruptly, as do super-powered(?) Samson and Atlas; the whole Krull subplot; events jumble up, and the time-frame gets muddied; a way to recreate Superman through his DNA is offered by Lex, but now it WILL take Lois (or another human woman's) DNA, to complete to task...Huh??? And Lois waits, expecting Supes to launch out of the Sun, cured...HUH???

I accept that the 12 graphic novels probably puts all this into perspective, but the video can't, in just 74 minutes.

I was disappointed by James Denton's vocal interpretation of Clark/Supes, also. Perhaps he was aiming for Godlike and aloof, but it seemed one-note, and flat, which was a shame, as Christina Hendricks (Lois), Anthony LaPaglia (Lex), Ed Asner (Perry White) and Finola Hughes and Arnold Vosloo (Lilo-El and Bar-El), were all superb.

I am a 25 yr vet of the independent comics Industry, having worked on dozens and dozens of titles.......I know a good story when I see it. A shortened version of the 12 issue mini series, but like Snyder's Watchmen, there's only so much you can pack into a hr or 2.",1299196800,4,928,4.383720930232558

I have a first generation PS2 that I use as my DVD player and the copy protection on the disc prevents the movie from playing in my primary DVD player.  I was able to watch it through my computer but I generally don't like watching movies through my computer.  I also bought ""Toy Story 3"" and ""Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths"" and both played perfectly.

Warner Bros. and the other studios are only making it harder for people who buy legitimate copies to fully enjoy their purchases.  People who bootleg movies have access to working around the copyright protection given that the Internet is online.  If I had known beforehand, I would have not bought this DVD despite the quality story-telling and animation.  I'm actually considering returning it.",1299196800,,825,4.7272727272727275
4336844,1,B004EE30C8,"This movie just didn't live up to it's cool cover. I didn't research the ""All-Star"" storyline in the comics, wanting to see something fresh and new. I'd had hoped this would be a precursor to the new upcoming Zach Snyder Superman film. If it is, there goes my high expectations. The lackluster story is just not worth owning on dvd.  Presenting Lex Luthor as the villain for the umpteenth time is a major flaw makes you feel like you've seen the movie before. A different villain or threat would've made the movie better. It's not really entertaining until ""guest stars"" appear or until they show Lex and Clark escaping together. I HATE the wimpy voice of Lois Lane. She's always been annoying, but also aggressive and strong, her best quality. Also, the animation gets really bad once Superman wares the white custome with the CHEAP CHEAP looking ""S"" on the front. Plus there's no resolution. It's sinceless that a 60/75 minute movie does not have an ending. What's to carry over? This is not Lord of the Rings. Like the previous Superman movies (Doomsday etc), this is only recommended for the diehard fans.

The single disc edition features the feature film, a Superman/Batman Apocalypse preview and one for the upcoming Green Lantern ""Emerald Knights"" animated feature which looks decent, as they are introducing a Supergirl-like character for Green Lantern.",1299110400,3,1362,4.943231441048035
4336845,5,B004EE30C8,"This movie has magic for everyone, it contains action, romance, comedy, and most important it leaves you with a feeling of hope in the human race! This seems as a simple achievement, but if you stop and think about it, how many animation movies from superheroes out there today accomplish the same? I would argue none.

The plot has been described in other posts in this site, so I would just add that for all fans out there that loved the comic, this DVD is an incredible rendition of the original work (the author himself, Grant Morrison, has say so many times in different interviews!).

If anyone reading this review knows a second or third language, you will enjoy this DVD even more! The single-disk and two-disk editions come with several audio tracks (English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Thai) providing the viewer with additional hours of entertainment. Even thought the plot is the same in all the audio tracks, the translations makes you feel that you are watching a brand new movie every time! When playing the movie with the Portuguese track, it seems that the movie develops in Brazil, when playing in French it is like everything was happening in Paris, etc.

Listening to the different audio tracks one can easily understand why Superman is one of the three fictional characters best known worldwide. Anybody around the world can identify himself/herself with the Superman's story. This movie was made so families all around the world could share the magic that a good Superman story always brings.

Also there is a scene where superman goes to Jail to meet Lex, telling him that now he wins and this is his opportunity to do something good for the world. Could of been a great scene but lacked any real feeling. Could of really captured emotion to what is going on. But felt that the 2 scenes above were put in for filler. I am glad they stuck to the original story but could of done more with both.

Now for the good part of the review. After the scene with lex in jail. The movie really picks up. You start to feel the passion Superman is feeling about moving forward even though he is dying. The ending was great.

If you are a DC universe fan of the DVD's you should buy this. There are others that were produced much better but this is by far not the worst in the collection. The justice leage ones are great. The Batman/superman ones are great. This one is worth the money.

Nicely done adaptation of Grant Morrison's graphic novel is an emotional and exciting Superman animated adventure and one of the better DC animated movies. The designs are quite different on the characters as if they appeared to look more like Peter ""Aeon Flux creator"" Chung's designs and i also like how this was the first appearence of Superwoman to appear. The animation is very good and so is the music, there is plenty of great action here and a great ending.

beaten up way too much and doesn't fight as much as he does in previous movies that he is in.

This is one of the best, if not THE best, DC animated movies to date and that's saying a lot, considering how much I liked Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, of which I rate this as better.  For one thing, Superman's powers are utilized properly here as the movie makes excellent use of his less frequently shown/mentioned abilities like freeze breath, telescopic sight, and the personal ""field"" extension that keeps his suit from tearing apart so easily.

Of note is the adult atmosphere being portrayed here.  When Superman is weak, he is weak... period (no lifting Kryptonite islands here out of shear will power).  If it take 3 weeks to reach an alien planet, he's not going to make it in 2 1/2, just because he was really confident.  In one scene, a woman makes a sexual comment about a window cleaner and people clearly die on screen.  Bad, terrible things happen to enemies that wouldn't normally happen in a DC cartoon.  There's even an instance of Luthor insulting a priest for his religious beliefs.  Superman's death is handled well; actually, it's handled so well that I think it's the way Superman (an immensely powerful, solar-powered alien being) should actually die.  And what they did with the Parasite is just greatness.

Some of the acting is a little hammy, (for example, when the doctor gives Superman his diagnosis, or when Lois learns the truth), which I think is a product of time-constraints.  And there's an incident with the Phantom Zone being portrayed as some sort of Heaven just for an emotional grab that I totally didn't accept, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

For all the good things I can say about this movie, some will not enjoy it, simply because it's more about characters instead of mindless action.  This is a story about Superman, the people he loves, the heroes that envy him, and the man that hates him the most.",1298851200,5,1886,4.798761609907121

4336855,4,B004EE30C8,"Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's All-Star Superman series is a modern day masterpiece of the graphic narrative, which kind of makes it a no-brainer to be picked for the next direct to video release of the animated DC Universe films.  All-Star Superman finds the Man of Steel (voiced by James Denton) facing his own mortality as his arch nemesis Lex Luthor (voiced by Anthony LaPaglia) has finally managed to find a way to kill Superman.  With his death imminent, Superman embarks on a journey that begins with declaring his love for Lois Lane (voiced by Christina Hendricks) and ending with a last confrontation with his greatest foe.  What shocks me the most about All-Star Superman is how faithful it winds up being to Morrison's comic.  Though there is a good deal lost in translation here (they are squeezing a twelve issue series into one 75-minute feature after all), this adaptation remains a great achievement regardless.  The animation is great, though not as detailed as Quitely's artwork, but it works nonetheless.

4336858,3,B004EE30C8,"All Star Superman the movie pales in comparison to the 12 issue story arc written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quitely. Although Dwayne McDuffie ( R.I.P.) tries to recreate the magic from the pages of the comic book he can't within the limited run time of the film. The film feels disjointed for that very reason . It has a stop start feel to it and leaves the viewer a bit confused at points. Morrison's All Star Superman was his big tribute to the character and really told the story of the most powerful man in the universe becoming even more so at the ultimate cost.

We get glimpses of how Superman spends his final days but we really don't get into his head the way we need to , to understand what all this means to him . Again this is not an indictment on McDuffie. The assignment to recreate this story was always an onerous one.

Not everything is bad about this film, i do love the recreation of the Superman theme as well as the animation. McDuffie also captures a small fragment of the Lex/Superman dynamic that does make for a few fun scenes in the movie. Also there is a line uttered by Lois in the film that is a simplified version of the one Morrison thought up for the book that resonated for me . It reflected Superman's selflessness and that eternal love they share. I used part of it in my review title.

I really tried to love this film because Superman is one of my favourite characters and Dwayne McDuffie one of my favourite creators, however, the movie really does not soar. If you liked the book and just love Superman buy it to see how it was executed. Otherwise you can skip it.",1298678400,6,1614,4.32013201320132
4336859,5,B004EE30C8,"Superman is one of the most recognizable icons in the world today. He has many adoring fans of all his media. He has been seen in comic books television and films and heard through radio serials and word of mouth.  In the mid 1990s Bruce Timm, after much success with his animated series of Batman, decided to move his talents to Superman. What he gave us was a true strait off the page Superman that was yet to be seen in visual media. This was a Superman that showed weaknesses just as deep as his strengths. His ability to care as well as his ability to slug it out with super natural threats. Most importantly this was a Superman that the fans have wanted to see brought to life Still, over time this vision remained in the shadow of its film counterpart which lacked his characteristics we still had yet to see that were as authentic as Bruce Timm's vision.

Bruce Timm's DCAU film projects have featured Superman doing what he does best, saving humanity and punishing evil.  Now we have the newest film `All Star Superman'. This was a film I was eager to see much like all the others, but what I got was something I never would have expected. I was aware of the plot and aware of the films basis, but this was the first time I have ever seen a specific side of the Man of Steel . That was a side of his I always knew was there, but this film brought it right out into the open and that is the Man of Steel's heart of gold. This film is very different from all the other films as a matter of fact, it is a work of art. The film touches on Superman's want to love and care for others. In the moments where he feels the most vulnerable are the moments he wears his heart on his sleeve for all to see. We see his relationship to Lois taken to brand new heights, his caring for his parents and even the urge to save the fallen like his arch nemesis Lex Luthor. Of course we are not without some amazing battles, but even in the bloodshed there is a deep emotion thrown into every punch that Superman throws.  The voice cast for this film is amazing. While so many want the regular voices of the DCAU greats, they are not always perfect for the films. Anthony LaPaglia was a perfect Luthor for this film because he was able to show a heartless Lex as well as one who seeks redemption. Christina Hendricks brings a brand new spunk to Lois with her perfect comedic timing as well as her most vulnerable of moments. James Denton could not have been a more perfect Superman for this project. He gave his all to bring out the Superman you see in this film. He gave Superman a heart and made this Superman so real and that is why I think I enjoyed this film.

There was a lot of negative feedback about this film so far, but I think it's because in order to love this film, you need to have a true love for Superman. You have to remember all the major factors that made him who he is from his origin story to the legendary quote ""Look...up in the sky!"" You have to have know, not just the names Clark Kent or Lois Lane, but Christopher Reeve, George Reeves and Teri Hatcher.  This is a movie that will lift you possibly make you cry, and make you feel emotions of love, loss and hope. 'All Star Superman', is a film that we Superman fans have secretly been waiting for, because it shows us fans of the DCAU and its creators that there is so much more than can be brought to a superhero besides the powers and flashy costumes. Because under the mask and the symbol, we all share the most important similarity of all, we are all human.

Also this was a perfect final project for DCAU writer Dwayne McDuffie who passed away one day after this DVD release. He gave us some of the DCAUs best work and this is couldn't be a better send off.",1298678400,9,3728,4.212885154061625
4336860,4,B004EE30C8,"The announcement of this movie left me a little ambivalent. Grant Morrison's All-Star Superman is probably the single best Superman story ever told, and while I'd like to see how it translates to film, I didn't really expect WB to do it much justice. Not to mention that Superman has starred in so many of these DVD movies already. Can't they focus on some of the other heroes of the DCU? Can't they make a sequel to Wonder Woman already?

Ultimately, I was pretty pleased with the film, knowing from the beginning there would be no way it could live up to the source material. The relatively short length of all these DVD projects proves to be a shortcoming yet again. The movie trims about half the material from the comic. The Bizarro storyline from issues #7-8 made sense to cut, but I really wish they had left in issue #6 and more of issue #10, as those two were the highlights of the series. The fact that Superman's fight with the Kryptonian scientists was left in while better material was cut is a little perplexing. But the story remains enjoyable, and that material which remains is surprisingly faithful to the comic in look and feel. A lot of the dialogue is pulled directly from the comic, and it turns out that Morrison's writing sounds better in spoken form than I would have thought.

The film also tries to replicate Frank Quitely's shot framing wherever possible. Unfortunately, his general style and character designs don't shine through so well. These movies tend to boil the original art styles down to a more similarly simplistic and generic regardless of the source material. I'm seeing a lot of complaints about the voice acting in other reviews, but I didn't have a problem with the voices. Yes, every interpretation of Superman and Lex Luthor will pale in comparison to Tim Daly and Clancy Brown's, but that's just how it is. The new voice actors do a respectable job with the material.

Abridged or not, I enjoyed this adaptation. It ranks third on my list of favorite DC animated DVDs so far (though admittedly I don't really care for any of them beyond Wonder Woman and New Frontier). When you factor in the always solid slate of bonus features on the disc, this isn't a bad purchase at all. Hopefully WB really manage to impress with the upcoming Green Lantern: Emerald Knights DVD.",1298592000,5,2314,4.666666666666667
4336861,3,B004EE30C8,"I agree with reviewers who felt that the movie tried to cram too much into this animated feature. The fact that the original comic book series takes up two volumes says something about that. As such, I felt that the movie didn't carry the same impact that the comic books did. It would take several episodes or maybe a two part feature, I feel, for it to have the same emotional and intellectual impact that the comic books have. Also, some reviewers noted that it lacked a plot and felt random. I believe the intent of the 'plot' is to chronicle significant moments of Superman's life which is why, from my perspective, it carried a somewhat episodic feel. This is what I felt when I read the comics, and I think it was captured by the movie's seemingly absent plot. I felt that the viewer was supposed to appreciate each event, each moment that Superman experiences as the movie builds up to the climax.
That being said, I did enjoy the film for what it was, a super compact version of the original series. As a whole it did a pretty decent job of capturing the essence of the comic books, but fell short in certain areas, making it an imperfect movie. Thus, 3 stars.",1298592000,3,1169,4.441860465116279

Totally opposite of what the comics, movies, toons - everything has put forth. The movie was just a collection on unrelated stories crammed into a single storyline. The animation was average, voice acting sub-par, plot awful. So why release this movie? Because it will sell a few hundred thousand copies, letting DC milk the franchise even more.

If you can stream it of Amazon or Netflix for free, then watch it. Pay for it? Never. Fans have slammed my review because it based on a new, alternate story line. Here's some news for you - NO IT IS NOT. All these story lines can be found in the comics in the 1960's and 1970's.

While reading other Amazon reviews every time someone mentioned a character I was thinking who? This movie jumps from one plot to another every two minutes which makes it impossible to really remember what was going on in this movie in the first place. I was facepalming my way through most of this. A lot of characters are introduced that serve absolutely no purpose in this movie and the final battle is just ridiculous.

4336865,4,B004EE30C8,"I feel like there's a running theme in these reviews of DCU animated stuff that is basically the equivalent of giving a product one star based on Amazon not shipping it fast enough, which is to say people who loved previous voice actors seem to have no room for new performers taking on the roles they've already decided should have been voiced by by the same people from Justice League Unlimited or something.  Here's the thing, especially with translating a book like All-Star Supes, it is completely fair game to use new, hot or otherwise available actors to do the voice work.  Just like Morrison and Quitely spun Superman (brilliantly, in my opinion) in a new direction, so did the artists and voice-actors who made this film.  To my mind, that's what the form is really good for, but at the least I say judge the piece on its own merits, not based on your love of previous voice actors.  I think Hendricks really nails the interesting and playful Lois that was written by Morrison, and Lapaglia conveys both Lex's brilliance and brutality quite nicely, for instance.  Bottom line, I think Warner Bros. has basically been embarrassing Marvel's animation for years, and this movie is the coup de grace.  If you love the comic it is pretty close to a best case scenario, even if you don't stack it against something like the Ultimate Avengers feature.",1298505600,6,1354,4.716101694915254
4336866,5,B004EE30C8,"It will be difficult for Bruce Timm and Co. to beat three of their last four: ""Batman: Under The Red Hood,"" ""Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths"" and now, this, the adaptation of arguably the best Superman story in the character's long history.

Even Timm admits that this 12-chapter-but-each-issue-stands-alone tale was hard to adapt. Dwayne McDuffie (now an Ancestor) did a great job, focusing the often metaphysical, mythological story on the main three (four): Superman/Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Lex Luthor. Lovers of the amazing story by Grant Morrison (one of the top writers in comics because even when he falls short, his work is more interesting that others' successes) will be disappointed to know what was cut--the Bizarro storyline, the Jimmy Olsen issue, the ""Earth Q""/What-does-Superman-mean story and the Smallville/Supermen Squad story. But what was kept in was extremely faithful to what Morrison and artist Frank Quitely created.

Contrary to many opinions here, the voices, in my opinion, are great and appropriate to the project. James Denton (Superman) is strong and vulnerable, Christina Hendricks (Lois Lane) shifts from caring to flirty to cynical to faithful, and Anthony LaPaglia (Lex Luthor) is consumed by jealousy and power. Luthor just wants to win, regardless of the costs. And he does. Then he loses more than he ever thought he would. And under McDuffie, involved in an ending/beginning that is as thought-provocating as it was under Morrison.

The Two-Disc Special Edition includes a documentary on Morrison's ideas about ""All Star Superman,"" the now-standard ""sneak peek"" into the forthcoming ""Green Lantern: Emerald Knights,"" and ""Blast From The Past,"" the ""Superman: TAS"" two-parter about Kryptonian fascists who fight Superman after leaving the Phantom Zone.

A great effort that more than makes up for ""Superman: Doomsday,"" which, like the live-action ""Superman Returns,"" doesn't work no matter how many times I watch it.",1298505600,7,1961,5.37785016286645
4336867,1,B004EE30C8,"This is a horrible movie.  Do not watch it.  It is barely possible to understand what is going on.  Every five minutes the story jumps somewhere else without any transition.  Random characters pop in and then go away five minutes later.  The plot is virtually non-existent.  The story was apparently (very badly) adapted from the comics - this pacing may work in comic book format, but not in a movie.

This could have worked if the movie was spread out over a dozen 30-minute episodes.  However, as things stand, this is unwatchable.  People that loved the comic this is based on may like it, but if you like movies you will almost certainly hate this.  This is like somebody stuffed loosely related random scenes on a DVD and sold them as a movie.

The voice acting is not that good either.  Most of the characters sound like they are reading lines from script without any understanding of what is going on.  Almost a monotone in places.  Not that they had much to work with, considering the dialog they were presented with.

The only good thing about this movie is the art.  I liked it, but then again I am not an expert.  Seemed pretty good to me.",1298505600,6,1151,4.483091787439614

And I really didn't feel any chemistry between her and Superman. I know this is an animated film, but I'm sorry, it just felt fake to me. I loved the Lex Luthor in this one though.

4336872,3,B004EE30C8,"Let me say this first: I've been following the DC direct to DVD animated films, and I never read the comics ""All-Star Superman"".

Now, I really found this film pretty hard to follow. In fact, I think there could've been 3-4 separate films made just on some incidents in this film.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

So, Reptile People who are descendants of the dinosaurs living at the Earth's core invade Metropolis and Superman gets help from a time traveling duo of heroes. That could've been an entire movie.

Two Kryptonian Astronauts who survived the destruction of Krypton find Earth and try transforming it into a new Krypton while Superman's been in deep space trying to free the shrunken Kryptonian city of Kandor. That could've been an entire movie.

Clark Kent and Lex Luthor trying to escape a prison break together turning into one really odd buddy film between arch-enemies in a bad situation. Definitely could've been it's own film, if done right.

Lex Luthor gets Superman's powers for 24 hours. That could've been it's own film if done right.

Yet instead we get all these things, Lois Lane not believing that Superman and Clark Kent are one and the same after he reveals it himself, and a Superman death story without Doomsday.

In other words, the narrative isn't exactly very tight. There's so much going on that's interesting, but then you just keep moving on instead of exploring any of these elements that could be worthy plots of their own films or at least TV episodes if nothing else.

Both ""Batman: under The Red Hood"" and ""Superman/Batman Apocalypse"" were much better films, tighter storylines, and a lot better action as well. ""All Star Superman"" tends to leave you a bit unsatisfied at the end. I mean, it's alright, it's better than nothing, but the direct to DVD animated films have done much better in the past and after two films that raised the bar in quality this one sorta limbos too low below those bars for my taste.

The documentary ""Superman Now"" is actually quite boring as well. If you liked the ""All Star Superman"" comics you'll like the documentary, but it really didn't do much for me, and I'm pretty big on the documentaries.",1298419200,3,2156,4.7560321715817695
4336873,2,B004EE30C8,"As others have said, the voice acting was a bit subpar.  Lex Luthor was very well done, and Perry White actually wasn't bad, but everyone else sounded like they had the ""let me read this script in a microphone and get a check"" attitude.  Very little chemistry.

The scenes with Clark Kent weren't too bad and probably the saving grace of the movie.  They kind of eluded to the reason that Clark acts so clumsy is to allow for distractions while he covertly uses his powers.

I'm not a fan of the ""old school"" Superman, which is portrayed in this film.  He's the ""all powerful, unlimited strength, unlimited intellect"" version.  It makes him a fairly boring action character, so you have to rely on emotional challenges.  Since the acting is played with very little emotion, you end up with a dull mess of a story.

Disappointed.  Glad I only rented it from Amazon :(",1298419200,4,866,4.564935064935065
4336874,5,B004EE30C8,"Watch this movie:
There has been some criticism of this film, let me address that.
All Star Superman was the best comic adaptation of Superman in decades, and this film is hardly different from that. Due to time constraints (though I don't know why they didn't just make it the necessary two hours), the story is a little jumpy and not enough is made of Superman's great feats/challenges. A lot is changed and dropped, subplot-wise, and the voice acting is acceptable but not the best I've seen. I say this is 4/5 stars for a casual fan, and to give it less than three is unnecessary hyperbole. For me, it's a no-brainer five stars. I just love this Superman. The source material is brilliant, the adaptation is acceptable, the animation is the best in a DC movie you've ever seen, the acting is solid, the ending is truly great, and is different from the comics.
If there is a flaw with this film, I already touched on it. The disjointedness of all the little subplots is confusing, and it ends up feeling like you're watching a few 15 minute episodes in between the main story. Still, that isn't to say those stories are unenjoyable.
Again, 4 stars when taking into consideration its imperfections. For me, this is an instant favorite simply because I adore the take on Superman that this embodies.",1298419200,9,1300,4.632034632034632
4336875,2,B004EE30C8,"I own every Timm/DCAU project, and at first had no idea how to rate this movie.

It's a goldmine of frustrated potential.

It's beautifully animated.  The story, although oddly episodic compared to their other adaptations, is well-written and carries an amazing emotional wallop...

Or, it would have.  If it had been cast well.

In a story that completely and totally hinges on Superman's heart, James Denton plays it so stiffly that at first I thought he was going to turn out to be a robot.
(I hadn't read the Grant Morrison comic, obviously).

I did love his Clark Kent moments, but that had more to do with the change in animation style.  I enjoyed the way Kent was written and drawn far better in this movie than the other DCAU stuff, so I was more forgiving of the voice acting.  They did Intentionally Hapless really well.

There's little to no chemistry in the big emotional beats for Superman and Lois.  I love Christina Hendricks, so I'd like to lay all the blame on Denton, but she lacks subtlety here.

Anthony LaPaglia's voice would be excellent in a battlefield and completely out of place in a boardroom.  LaPaglia plays Lex like Sergeant Rock.  There's no slickness or snake oil to the character at all.  In fact, he sounds a lot like Perry White.

I was still tempted to give the movie three stars, just because there are so many little moments that convey the true awesomeness of Superman.  He has a freaking atomic anvil, for pete's sake!  Timm has admitted to dropping the ball in characterizing the Man of Steel in the past, and this story works as a love letter to the strength, determination, and kindness that make the character so iconic.

I honestly could've counted it among my top 3 DCAU films.

If it had been cast well.

In a way, that made it even more disappointing.",1298419200,12,1799,4.59433962264151
4336876,3,B004EE30C8,"I feel mixed about this movie.  I've been a fan of DC animated movies and in fact own most of them. Do I regret owning this?  No, I'm a big fan of Superman; therefore, seeing the big man in blue in action is always a treat for me.  However, this movie felt half-done to me.  The story was so-so.  It just simply is not very deep or memorable.
The animation is great, and the voice acting was believable.  This just lacks re-watchability factor.  At least in Superman/Batman Apocalypse, the action scenes were somewhat epic particularly the fight with the Furies.  This movie just lacked oomph.
Overall, decent movie.  I'm just afraid that future DC animated movies might be heading in a downward slope in terms of entire movie-making quality.",1298332800,6,742,4.689922480620155
4336877,5,B004EE30C8,"I went into this movie not expecting a whole lot, mainly from the negative reviews I've read, but I was happily surprised with this film. I only read the first volume of the graphic novel and thought it was an interesting tale for Superman. I never did get volume 2, but after watching this I really want to. It's one of my favorite DCA movies yet. It's right behind ""Batman: Under The Red Hood"" for me. I thought the animation complimented the graphic novel nicely, actually thought they improved on it. The beginning and end are definitely some of the best parts of the film. I loved the scenes with Clark and Lex, and when Clark visits Jonathan's grave site. It definitely has some emotional scenes in it, which I thought was great.

Can't wait for Green Lantern: Emerald Knight & Batman: Year One!",1298332800,7,801,4.5625
4336878,5,B004EE30C8,"Superman may be my favorite hero, though in recent years my young adult cynicism has had me leaning towards the Dark Knight who is in a veritable golden age of creative expression due in no small part to Nolan and Grant Morrison himself. With the constraints that a 75 minute animated film affords, this tale explodes in this format with some of the finest hand drawn animation I have seen from the DCU films and quite comparable to the slick action of Young Justice. That being said, this film is fully aware of its unique yet timeless take on the man of steel, and the spirit and style of the Morrison/Quietly comic is all here. As a fan of the big blue boy scout, I found this to be a very satisfying feature and an indispensable addition to not just the DCU library but the grand picture and myth of the last son of Krypton.
Did I mention the wonderful extras? It includes some insightful interviews with Dan Didio and Grant Morrison that give insight not just into this story but the creative process

I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of them including the recent Batman Under the Red Hood and Superman Batman Apocalypse but this movie is just plain terrible. It feels horribly rushed and disjointed and the plot is incoherent. The plot lines with Samson and Atlus, the krypton astronauts and that talking red star were  ridiculous. These story arcs amounted to nothing and came out of thin air. They tried to cram all of the story arcs from the All star comic series run but it leaves it feeling contrived.  There is not much more to say except skip this mess. Its kind of a shame since the works of Bruce Timm  and the DCAU line are usually exemplary.",1298332800,13,763,4.397163120567376

Denton did not sound heroic, just his usual ""guy next door' charm which worked very well for Clark Kent but not for Superman.  As for Hendricks, her Lois Lane was completely cold and unlikable. Save for the very end, I could not detect any trace of emotion in her performance.  Only Anthony LaPaglia brought it for Lex Luthor.  He's a talented actor and his Lex was fantastic.  Otherwise, the movie is worth a solid watching and that's about it.",1298332800,11,591,4.59047619047619
4336882,2,B004EE30C8,"I will admit I am a big fan of the DC Universe Animated features.  However, I did not like this product, at all.  The story is weak and it seems to be written by someone who does not know the Superman character, or just started reading him after DC started competing with Marvel for more ""in depth and personal"" views of their characters.  Please note, this applies to the comic as much as the feature.  As someone pointed out, Superman is not everyone's favorite because he is always the boy scout, always comes out on top and even in death, you know he will overcome anything.  So, for this to end as it did, it shows that even the story teller is trying to make his mark more than he is carrying on the tradition of Superman.  But let's not stop there...the flaws with this film go beyond the bad subject story.  The story itself is told very poorly.  I have stated my biggest complaint, but there is also too much going on in this piece to have a cohesive timeline.  I get that they want to include as much as possible from the All Star series, but at least those books made sense (as much as comics make sense).  And they made sense because there was some sort of order and reason behind what occured.  Not here.  Kryptonian Astronauts only as a 5 minute aside?  The Parasite chases Clark Kent and Luthor and Lex is too obtuse to figure that the being of immense power the Parasite is pursuing is not him?  Come on now.  Once again, a bad story being poorly retold by someone who does not know the characters and is more interested in making his own mark, and does so at the expense of the story, the icons about which he writes and the viewers.  The only reasons it gets more than one star is because I am a fan of Superman and I cannot ""hate"" anything with him in it.",1298332800,4,1774,4.250746268656717
4336883,3,B004EE30C8,"If I hadn't read up on All-Star Superman before it came out and knew it'd be based on the comics, I'd have been very displeased with this entry.

As such, knowing which comic line of Superman it's based on helps. As an animated adaptation of the comics, it's not bad, they did manage to find and create a common thread throughout the story, but it still creates a largely episodic feel and you can really pick out 4-5 major episodic moments or shorts all tied together. When Superman creates the serum for Lois Lane so she can experience what it's like to have superpowers, I'm very much reminded of a series of comics from the early career of superman where there were some off the wall stories between superman and lois.

I wouldn't reccomend the 2-Disc feature just to get the two Superman the Animated series episodes. If you've collected up the complete Animated series prior to this, you've got the episodes already. Stick with the one-disc, that's more worth the time and money.

I will give kudos towards the end of the movie, when Luther has drunk the super serum, the line of dialogue he has and ""This is how Superman sees us?"" when talking about being able to see atoms and how everything and everyone is connected, we're not separate. That's good and makes for a redeeming factor to this movie.

So disjointed, episodic. It is good for someone who knows Superman, but doesn't know him that well where history and continuity are concerned. If you get it, just don't try to force it into the DC Universe continuity.",1298332800,3,1525,4.6162361623616235

I had it automatically downloaded to my TIVO from Amazon, and I don't know that the 2-disk SE DVD would be worth adding another two episodes of the old animated series (how many special-edition caliber Superman fans don't already own them, anyway?). But this was well worth the regular price to download and watch the film. I thought the voice acting was good (a good job differentiating between supes and clark, but not my favorite luthor), the music was very good, and the plot was unique and poignant. I'm also glad this wasn't another origin story. It didn't dwell on that at all, which is good because I'm getting sick of seeing that done over-and-over for DC and even Marvel (also why I still think the Green Arrow ""Supermax"" movie sounds awesome, but I digress). This gives you like a 10 second reminder, and then hey, it's superman, he can fly...where have you been, a cave? This story is totally a stand alone, and clearly outside the normal continuity.

I'd give it 4.5 stars, but since that's not an option, it gets the full monty.  If you liked the Batman/Superman/JL series, you'll like this.",1298332800,8,1235,4.609090909090909

It has some nice moments: some interesting, some touching.  But its plot varies wildly from interesting to the bizarre to borderline incoherent.  It really is all over the place.  Rather than a film with a central story-line, it's really more of a series of episodic vignettes, loosely strung together with a central theme, which is...(spoiler alert)...Superman is dying.  One thing that is interesting, even nice, about this film/story is that it is a different take on Superman facing his potential mortality--different than say, ""The Death of Superman""/Doomsday slug-fest of which more people are familiar.  It shares some similar romantic ques cues with the animated ""Superman: Doomsday,"" (i.e. Lois having to come to terms with loosing the man she loves); unfortunately All-Star's execution seems haphazard by comparison.  If anything, it feels as silly as a *bad* episode of the 1970's ""Super Friends""--a series I remember quite fondly.  Indeed, I would have gladly enjoyed a cameo from the Wonder Twins, rather than have to suffer though the two moronic Hans & Franz characters that pop into this movie out of nowhere, with little explanation as to who they even are or why we should care about them.  I freely admit I have not read the ""All-Star Superman"" comic, which I'm sure explains all; but that should never be a requirement in order to watch and understand a movie based upon it.  If you've read it, it's nice to able to pick up on the various Easter eggs an average viewer might miss--but that doesn't mean that an average viewer should end the film asking, ""WTF did I just watch??""  I have to agree with what appears to be a fairly common criticism of this film: that the producers tried to pack way too many elements from the comic (which I'm sure is excellent) into 70 minutes--which resulted in an incoherent mess.  That said, it has some nice themes and sparks my curiosity enough I may actually pick up the actual comic and give it a read.
