It's an American International picture, but it truly has the quality of a big budget MGM film.  To me, even the way the film was edited was outstanding..  Ronald Sinclair did such a marvelous job of taking the scenes of the tight spaces of a submarine and editing them in such a way that the audience doesn't feel claustrophobic.
This is a must watch for all fans of war dramas!",1426723200,,562,4.384615384615385
7827518,3,6302479541,"I thought that I had seen every WWII submarine movie ever made until this one turned up on AMC the other morning at 6AM.

While it breaks no new ground, the plot is fairly predictable and the characters, if not the actors, seem to have appeared in numerous other films, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Given the technology, special effects (as they are) are pretty much standard for the era. Underwater scenes seem to be out of scale, and it does take some suspension of disbelief.

The acting is only average and I did not recognize a single actor. However the film flowed nicely and kept my interest.

I believe that the film is based on (more or less) historical fact although I'm sure that liberties were taken.

I was looking here for a DVD version but can't seem to find one. I pretty much consider what's left of my VHS collection to be more nostaligic than anything else and really want to see this movie released on DVD so that I can add it to my collection.

If you can live with VHS in this age of Blu-Ray and HDTV, go ahead and buy this version as the movie is certainly worth watching.",1207094400,4,1092,4.354679802955665
