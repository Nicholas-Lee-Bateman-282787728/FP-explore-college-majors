2919545,2,B000UAE7LS,"Buried Alive revolves around a group of college kids who soon learn that the demonic spirit of a woman murdered in their vacation house is out for blood, and guess who's in her axe-wielding sights?  Robert Kurtzman, best known as partner to gore effects gurus Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger (hence, KNB Effects) and the original scripter for From Dusk Till Dawn, directs Buried Alive, and sadly it comes off as another derivative, uninspired slasher flick that provides little in the way of scares or suspense.  The acting is atrocious and the story is cliche and oh so predictable (for the most part), but Buried Alive does have a few good moments of note, including some nifty gore effects and a small role from Saw's Tobin ""Jigsaw"" Bell, who himself up's the creep factor just by appearing on film.  All in all, Buried Alive may be worth a look for die hard slasher fans, but those that don't see it won't be missing much at all either.",1196553600,7,940,4.616766467065868
2919546,3,B000UAE7LS,"With the element of surprise being paramount in the success of scaring you in a horror film, this one does not succeed.  It's fairly predictable.  I kept reading how great the special effects were going to be in this film, but I was disappointed in that aspect the most.  The film does have some unique moments and Tobin Bell gets more screen time than I was first led to believe.  It did not exceed nor fall behind my expectations.  In my opinion, the actors did a respectable job with a weak script.  There wasn't a lot to work with.",1194825600,4,535,4.353535353535354
2919547,3,B000UAE7LS,"This film certainly isn't anything to write home about.  It's fairly derivative and has an almost shockingly anticlimactic finale.  Having said that, there are some decent scares, some gorarrific death scenes, nice production values, and a few unexpected twists.  The film would have benefited from more interesting actors, writing, and direction to distinguish it as it certainly doesn't stand out from the pack. However, I'm being slightly generous by awarding it three stars, in part due to some well executed special effects.",1193616000,5,529,5.426829268292683
2919548,3,B000UAE7LS,"But I've also seen a lot worse.  The movie had it's fun moments.  The problem is it's a YRV movie trapped inside an R rating.  It was boring at times, and the ""plot"" didn't really make much sense, but it had it's moment of being a little scary.  Maybe it's just the other horrible movies I've seen (*cough* Rest Stop *cough*) but I didn't think this was that terrible.

Then again, it definitely wasn't that great.",1247529600,,414,4.394736842105263
2919549,3,B000UAE7LS,"This ones about a group of college kids going away for the weekend up to a supposed haunted house. The house is owned by two of the kids who are cousins. The girl has gone with two of her pledging students for there hell week type of initiation c rap,
And the other is interested in finding gold that his great grandfather supposedly according to what was thought to be myth has left gold up there.
Also tagging along is a geek who was promised he could come for helping the main guy with his school work, and the other the other cousins boyfriend.

They unravel a bit about there family history and the male cousin wants to find them gold in them hills he granddaddy found, only something strange is happening in the house.
Also there is the cooky old uncle who is that guy from Saw, and he has plans to find the gold too.

Overall, it wasn't a bad film. Worthy of a rental at least, the acting is decent, the FX are pretty good, but the ending could have used a bit more of a kick to it.

You may like it if you liked ""April Fools"" (the original, not that newer crappy one)

*Spoiler* the big thing that makes no sense in this movie is the stupid incest scene between the cousins, if you decide to watch this, try to ignore it happening and the crappy start to the movie, and you might just somewhat enjoy the rest of the film.",1246320000,,1329,4.1796875

If you're hardcore about your large film collection and pick up just about anything you can find for next to $ nothing, you probably already have or seen this one.  If not, there are 100's of thousands of other movies out there to explore.  The movie just doesn't work.  My tastes run far and wide - but this one is added to the list of movies I can't seem to enjoy on any level.  These sort of movies embarrass me.

I never write reviews but this is sooo heinously poor that I must warn others not to plonk down $3 to rent this unmitigated disaster. Horrible. If you see it, pass and never look back.

2919553,2,B000UAE7LS,"First off lemme make clear this is NOT the 1990 film starring Tim Matheson & Jennifer Jason Leigh or is it Sony's 2007 misuse of the title either. This is Dimension Extreme's 2006 Buried Alive Unrated that spouts above the title starring (starring? He's in just three scenes!) Tobin Bell from Saw. But like those other films with the same name, you yourself might feel a little underground when watching this movie too.

Take a group of six college kids: two cousins, the girl cousin's boyfriend, the boy cousin's nerdy computer friend, and two fraternity-pledging bimbos off on an adventure to stay one night in the cousin's great-great grandparents home where many years ago ole grandpa offed his first Indian wife over gold found on the grounds. Unfortunately though for that family tree, now the ghostly spirit of that first wife wants to kill any member of that bloodline and is just awaiting them to come on down to the ranch for a visit. Along the way the group runs into the groundkeeper (played by Bell, who's acting is still top-notch and deserves better than this), and figures out that he's not the only one looking for all that lost gold that started a number of murders on the property years ago. Eventually strange things start happening, axes go flying, and we get a history lesson into ancient Indian beliefs and curses.

Directed by legendary special effectsman Robert Kurtzman (who's resume is a mile long with Horror highlights like Evil Dead 2, Phantasm 2, Bride Of Re-Animator, Halloween 5, the impressive list goes on and on) you'd figure after all this time making Horror films would be a piece of bloody cake. However, it's awfully surprising the lack of gore within this story. Don't get me wrong, the few scenes that have it (all practical:aka rubber) are quite impressive, but they're too quick and not enough. In fact, this movie outside of one early shot really doesn't get the frights started till almost the hour and ten minute mark! However, Kurtzman's visuals are nice with desert backgrounds, full up-high shots, and creepy house views, but the story is more like a ghost thriller than a typical Horror film, like the script was from the 70's or something. Also for a major studio title, to be completely bare-boned other than a few start-up previews doesn't help the overall purchase either. Might be worth a rent for seeing an older ""female"" slasher in this usual male-driven genre, not to mention a couple of cute nudity set-up's, but overall for a guy with a resume like Kurtzman's, he really should have came up with something more exciting and to the bloody point than this.

2919555,4,B000UAE7LS,"Buried Alive promised so much on the write up on the back and to a point it did deliver.

Basic story of amorous college girls and guys go away for a good time and are unfortunate enough to walk straight into a scenario involving a dead chick out for blood and a creepy Tobin Bell. The axe-welding maniac from the grave manages to wreck havoc and along the way we get to see some nakedness so, no complaints really.

Some of the kills are done off-screen which to me is not a major problem as there is a decent amount of gore still on offer. All in all I enjoyed this film and was happy enough to pay the 12 bucks to add it to my growing collection of b-grade and a-grade horrors.",1206403200,3,680,4.105263157894737
2919556,1,B000UAE7LS,"Buried Alive boasts 'legendary effects wizard Robert Kurtzman' in the director's seat, but that fact only seems to make the movie more of a slap in the face. In the director's seat, but obviously asleep most of the time, Kurtzman's effort here is a simple exercise in missed opportunities. Not to belabor the point or anything, but the gore is cookie cutter (when there is any at all), and it almost seems like the director is reluctant to kill off any of his characters. Half of the deaths occur off-camera. Weak.

What could have been a sleazy, trashy, and brilliantly gory (given Kurtzman's other work), if not necessarily inspired, tribute to 80's slashers ends up being not much fun at all. One star for not really trying.",1202256000,,727,4.724409448818897
2919557,3,B000UAE7LS,"buried alive, was okay. i figured there would have been more to the story, and a few more jumpy scenes. but for what it delivered i gave it three stars. a few college kids going out to this old place where story goes it's haunted by some woman that was buried alive there. well, it's just stories right? so they take off planning to make this two inductees to a frat house to be there slaves for a weekend. while the owners great grandkid has plans of his own. to uncover some gold that's suppose to be buried there. well the caretaker of the place, tobin bell, is already a creepy man, so that just adds to the place. well, everything doesn't go as planned, the stories are true. there's a few good killing scenes, and the dead woman, looks pretty creepy. that was all good. just needed a bit more to scare you. i think they tried to hard casting these college peeps and making them run around nude. that doesn't add a bit to the scare factor. other than that, pretty good. one or two of the actors were pretty good, and that tobin bell, what can i say. great actor, and that voice is a creepfest all it's own.",1197158400,,1111,4.245283018867925

8212694,1,B000UAE7LS,"I ordered this DVD thinking that I was getting the Jeff Blum version. Instead I got this creepy but senseless horror movie wannabe.  As it turns out, the version I really wanted appears to be a recycled, slightly altered version of the one I got. Amazon has added to the confusion by carrying the SAME REVIEWS FOR BOTH DVDS. I KID YOU NOT! There really isn't anything to add to what the other reviewers had to say.  However, when one of your party goes outside and disappears for who knows how long shouldn't someone look for him or check to see if he is OK when they do find him? No sir. Not in the world of titillating horror films.

Here are a few lessons to be learned from this movie aside from the fact that you shouldn't have watched it in the first place:
1)Never turn your back on your bathtub while looking in a mirror wearing ear phone plugs while the water is coming in.
2)Never ever go down into a basement in a horror movie - surprise, surprise - you might get locked in.
3)Don't admire any of the presented eye candy. It's not going to be around very long.
4)Always be suspicious whenever you see a necklace or a tatoo.
5)The obvious bad guy is not really going to be the murderer because it IS too obvious.
6)Beware of any movie that begins with someone bathing in a bathtub.
7)Beware of any movie where you have ""kissing cousins"".
8)Beware of any movie where the first major scene turns out to be an hallucination.
9)Beware of any movie with the title ""Buried Alive"" in it.
10)Don't be shocked if anyone gets buried alive in a move titled ""Buried Alive"".
11)And finally, don't wonder how you can hear someone screaming through all the dirt heaped upon them when buried alive.
12)Double finally, Beware of any movie where it has the same reviews for it as another movie with the same title.",1421193600,,1806,4.4174174174174174
8212695,2,B000UAE7LS,"Buried Alive (Robert Kurtzman, 2007)

Robert Kurtzman's 2007 effort The Rage has garnered accolades from any number of people whom I otherwise believe to have some taste in film. I have never understood what they see in it. Buried Alive, his 2007 follow-up, has never received those same kudos. That made sense even before I saw this movie, but now, for some horrible reason, I have seen it, and the best thing I can say about it is it's not the worst movie I saw today. (That dubious distinction goes to the dreadful Machine Gun Preacher). But if you're looking for a decent horror movie, this is not the way to go.

Plot: cousins Rene (Going Down in La-La Land's Leah Rachel in her screen debut) and Zane (Green Street Hooligans' Terence Jay) attend the same college. Rene's sorority has a couple of pledges to haze, and Zane, who's on academic probation, is looking for an alternate means of living if he gets kicked out of school. Both of these things lead to the two of them packing a car full of young-and-beautifuls and heading out to the old ancestral pile, where grandpappy it a huge gold score a long time ago, much of which seems to have mysteriously vanished. Zane and his research assistant Phil (Here Comes the Boom's Germaine Scott Grimes) have come to the belief through scouring old newspaper clippings that grandpappy hid the rest of the gold somewhere on his propertya belief shared by eccentric old housekeeper Lester (Saw's Tobin Bell, whose taste in scripts continues to astonish), who's been doing some digging in the basement when not practicing his taxidermy. They, and tagalongs Danny (Latter Days' Steve Sandvoss), Laura (Repo Men's Erin Reese), and Julie (Lindsey Scott in, to date, her only feature appearance), soon discover that what grandpa buried in the basement may not have been a precious metal...

And hey, here's a surprise for anyone who's seen The Rage, or come to think of it anyone who's seen more than a half-dozen random DTV horror films made in the past quarter-century: nothing that happens in this movie is something you haven't seen before. (I should note that the surprise in that last sentence was intended sarcastically.) This is about as standard a supernatural slasher film as supernatural slasher films come, to the point where you have most likely identified the Final Girl(TM) within five minutes of the movie starting. I gave it two stars because Art Monterastelli (Rambo)'s script does have a few genuine chuckles during the middle stretchonce they have gotten to the house, but before anything really starts happening, at the point where most movies of this strip drag like the killer's victims on their way to the meatpacking plantbut those moments are not nearly enough to carry this movie. **",1400716800,,2754,4.85531914893617

You always know what you're going to get, it's usually a happy ending, or it's an ending that leaves room for a sequel, or it's a surprising ending that you see coming a mile away.  Buried Alive, is different.  The plot reminded me of Philip Zimbardo's prison experiment, and the Milgram experiment.  It's one of the stories that looks at human reaction to events, etc.  The acting was good, and I love seeing movies with up and coming actors/actresses in them--so overall, it was a good flick.  If you're looking for a big Hollywood movie with tens of million dollar budget, go elsewhere; however, if you're looking for a good independent movie, check it out.",1312502400,,715,4.725806451612903

A great story, great acting, great sound design, and great direction. I watch just about all the mockbusters around so I know a little bit about how these things work, a fast lazy version of the major motion picture so I was suprised to see a version on Buried that was just as intense as the theatrical version. Buy it, rent it, just watch it.
