8763251,3,B01GP4HSHC,"""The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell and a hell of a heaven."" Jason (Chatwin) is the type of guy that lives life to the fullest. No regrets and no over thinking. When his friends show up for a weekend full of fun and excitement they head to a trendy new bar, and get more than they bargain for. When a mysterious man (Brosnan) gives them access to a new drug the entire group is affected and things begin to change, and not always for the better. This is a decent movie and is worth seeing. It does have moments of tenseness and is a very well written thriller, but the real reason to watch is for the message of the movie. Essentially a drug is taken that allows people to reveal their true selves. If this type of thing truly existed I think this movie would end up being true, and that is both scary and sad. Jason doesn't really feel the effects of it and that says a lot about how he lives and makes you wonder if his lifestyle is really the way to live. Overall, a very good, sexy type thriller that surprisingly has a message. I give this a B.",1470182400,7,1081,4.07981220657277
