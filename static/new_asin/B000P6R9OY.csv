2811868,5,B000P6R9OY,The Ultimate review: it made us pee with laughter. This is the funniest show that nobody knows about. Laura Kightlinger is a truly original comedic voice. This series is a combination of Ab Fab and Curb your Enthusiasm but funnier. The comedic writing is on a consistently high level with some of the best lines since Fran Leibowitz. these discs are Season One and originally aired on the IFC channel. I'm definitely tuning in for Season Two.,1185840000,16,442,4.753246753246753

at a great rate!  Thanx :)",1290038400,,135,3.6551724137931036
2811875,5,B000P6R9OY,"This item was so hard for me to find stores so when I found it on amazon I was so excited.  The price was better than anything I could have found in stores.  And not only that, but I had it delivered to my door, so I didn't even have to leave the house.  It was delivered before the date suggested and in the original wrapping.",1258848000,,327,3.9242424242424243
2811876,4,B000P6R9OY,"IFC's The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman isn't always a laugh out loud send-up the movie business (like, well, IFC's other send-up The Business), but where it succeeds are in some small moments of pure brilliance that really make the show something special.  The criminally underrated Laura Kightlinger stars as Jackie Woodman; a would-be screen-writer stuck writing for a Hollywood rag.  Her best friend and frequent driver Tara (an all grown up Nicholle Tom) is along for the ride, as Jackie finds herself getting wooed by a graphic novelist (Giuseppe Andrews) and then having to work with him, along with experiencing the ""joys"" of peyote, and finally getting addicted to a prescription drug and becoming even more addicted to an uber-conservative radio host (Ray Wise).  The characters are richly brought to life, and while the show isn't instantly enjoyable right off the bat, it still comes off as something special to behold.  All in all, The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman is a show that deserves your attention, and this is a DVD worth picking up to boot.",1213574400,5,1082,5.061797752808989
2811877,5,B000P6R9OY,"This show is one of the funnier things I've ever seen- the writing is great and the characters, wonderfully played by Laura Kightlinger and Nicholle Tom, are believable people, making the show all the more worthwhile.  The comedy is bitter, but really well done, and the plot lines don't get old- an easy pitfall for shows about Hollywood.  Overall, a great effort, can't wait for more!",1212537600,4,386,4.833333333333333
2811878,4,B000P6R9OY,"This is a subversive, funny, and smart t.v. show that too few people know about.  Laura Kightlinger and Nichole Tom are an amazing duo--a classic pairing of friends like Lucy and Ethel or Laverne and Shirley!  Only drunk on martinis or high on peyote.  This is the other Los Angeles that only people who live here know is the real one!",1210809600,3,335,4.459016393442623
2811879,4,B000P6R9OY,This is a great series - A very updated spin on the old MTM show - Unfortunately the 3rd season became a victim of the writer's strike and the series was not renewed.,1209859200,,166,4.0606060606060606
2811880,5,B000P6R9OY,"Laura Kightlinger and Nicholle Tom are today's Lucy and Ethel--or Laverne and Shirley--if those characters were getting drunk, taking pills and swearing like truck drivers (no, these gals swear worse than truck drivers).  The basic premise of the show is writer Jackie (Laura) and her best friend Tara (Nicholle) are trying to find fame and fortune out in Hollywood, but nothing ever seems to go right for them.  These two ladies are a hoot.  You will laugh out loud.  You might even wet yourself so be careful while watching this hilarious series.  I loved that two of my favorite actresses--Sally Kellerman and Colleen Camp--both show up in episodes and join in the fun.  I also have to mention the wonderful Azura Skye and Patrick Bristow who play Jackie's co-workers (I wanted to see more of them!).  The humor is very dark and twisted--just so you know--but if you've got a warped sense of humor like I do, you will probably fall head over heels for the lovely Jackie Woodman and the delightful Tara Wentzel.  I want to party with these ladies--or at least buy the DVDs of the second, third and fourth seasons of their terrific show.",1201132800,2,1138,4.741116751269035
2811881,4,B000P6R9OY,"I usually dislike TV shows and films about the ""business"" (ironically, that's a title of another IFC show about the film business that is mean, cruel, crass, and obnoxious), but I am really liking this show.  Yes, it's about the film business, Hollywood, L.A., and the tons of crap that you have to put up with, but it's not so inside that only people who work in the business can understand.  It's not filled with gratuitous celebrity cameos either.  Some ""insider"" shows, like The Larry Sanders Show, had this smug, ""aren't we corrupt, let's indulge in it"" attitude.  Most of the celebrity cameos were celebrities just playing themselves, which wasn't particularly creative, and most of the character in Sanders (sans Hank, brilliantly played by Jeffrey Tambor) seemed more like caricatures than anything else.  Here, the 2 main characters, played by Nicole Tom and the show's creator Laura Kightlinger, feel like real people.  The series is actually quite funny, only occasionally resorting to lame shock humour or childish behaviour (even though when it does, it cheapens the series).  It's also nice to see Laura Kightlinger get some overdue recognition.  She was a standup comedienne in the 1990's who hosted several shows on Comedy Central.  All she was really known for was a stint on SNL, a consulting producer on Will and Grace, and being Jack Black's girlfriend for 5 years or so (before he dumped her just when he got big).  I used to watch the her standup show because I had a HUGE crush on her (and still do).  I don't remember any of the comics I saw, I just like to look at her.  She still is beautiful, and this series is very good.",1186876800,5,1649,4.747368421052632
2811882,5,B000P6R9OY,"This is a brilliant irreverent comedy.  I love the writing, acting, and directing.  It is an absolute scream and I am so excited Season 1 has been released on DVD. I can't wait for IFC to start airing Season 2.  This show is brills!!!! Don't miss it:)",1186185600,5,251,4.297872340425532
2811883,5,B000P6R9OY,"""I am really precognitive about these kinds of things...""

or something like that, what a painfully funny wonderfully spiteful show..... don't watch it if you are a lame idiot, cause you will so see yourself skewered!! My feelings got hurt at least once an episode and I never missed an episode!!",1186012800,6,296,4.803921568627451

8189380,5,B000P6R9OY,The writing in this show is so frank and original. I love the performances and the subject matter of each episode.,1402444800,,114,4.476190476190476
8189381,5,B000P6R9OY,If you're a fan of dark comedies you'll love this twisted take on the two zany gal pals making their way through the demented world of Hollywood. It's a shame IFC didn't release the second season too but I guess even they have bean counters in suits declaring comedicgenius is not profitable. A must for anybody involved with Hollywood.,1394582400,,336,4.711864406779661
8189382,5,B000P6R9OY,I can be a bit of a nut myself - so these episodes totally crack me up.  It's totally girliee - about the stuff two best friends get into.  I just wish they had the other seasons too!,1377907200,,183,3.789473684210526
8189383,4,B000P6R9OY,A rather humorous satire. Sometimes a little slow but definately different than many other ideas. These two are quite the team.,1377734400,,127,5.095238095238095
8189384,5,B000P6R9OY,"This show was on IFC years ago and was pretty funny. Not hysterical funny, but written well. I live in LA and deal with different aspects of the entertainment business. This show is spot-on at times with the sheer lunacy of this town vis a vis celebrity worship and no talent idiots who got lucky. This first season is good. Second season was better, though not available on DVD yet for some reason. Comparable to ""The Comeback"" with Lisa Kudrow or ""Episodes"" with Matt LeBlanc as far as a low-key, well-written comedy that not many have heard of. Highly recommended and keep an eye out for season 2.",1377043200,2,600,4.564814814814815
8189385,5,B000P6R9OY,I miss this show. It's funny as hell and I keep looking for someway to get a hold of Season 2 but I can't get it from anywhere!,1367798400,,127,3.5714285714285716
8189386,5,B000P6R9OY,"Sorry for my weak review here. I love this show, it's one of the only ""TV show"" DVDs that I watch on a semi-regular basis.

I can't for the life of me understand why this show didn't proceed into a season 3, or why season 2 isn't on DVD.

The writing is too good to let fall to waste. Even the credits segment is funny (the theme song rocks too).",1307836800,6,346,3.9285714285714284
8189387,5,B000P6R9OY,"This is by far the funniest show you will EVER watch about living in Hollywood .Every Character is perfectly written and I never get tired of watching !
