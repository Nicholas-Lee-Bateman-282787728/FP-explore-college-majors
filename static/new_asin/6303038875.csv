539351,2,6303038875,"One reviewer was watching this DVD for Vivian Blaine; another, for Perry Como. I was watching for Dennis O'Keefe. Now all we need is a review from someone watching it for Carmen Miranda and we'll be set.

I have to agree with the other two reviewers: the DVD is horrible, although I am watching the Critics Choice release rather than the Alpha version. Evidently both were made from the same poor quality master. The sound is obnoxiously loud, and the picture is contrasty and uncomfortable to watch, even though the package says ""Digitally Restored."" Nevertheless, all the actors are good, and I love Como's songs. O'Keefe is good, but this is not one of his better roles.

If anyone else is interested in the films of Dennis O'Keefe, this is the first one out of about ten I've ordered recently that had poor quality. It's also the only one in which I've been disappointed for any reason. I'm hoping O'Keefe will be rediscovered at some point, and more of his films released, because they are wonderful. His range is broad. He does excellent dramatic work in Film Noir classics like T-Men and Raw Deal - both by Anthony Mann - and in Fighting Seabees with John Wayne; comedies like Up In Mabel's Room and Getting Gertie's Garter; detective pictures like Dishonored Lady and Cover Up; and family films like The Great Dan Patch.

I think if a company releases a DVD on which the movie is substandard, they should state as much in their write-up, instead of waiting for people to get the film and then be disappointed. They aren't helping themselves by releasing substandard product. I wondered why Critic's Choice Video, a company with an extensive catalog, had a 92% satisfaction rating. Now I know.

539352,4,6303038875,"Pretty fantastic musical, enlivened no end by vivacious Vivian Blaine in the title role along with some memorable tunes (""Walking in My Dreams"", ""Here Comes Heaven Again"").

The story is straight-forward:  burlesque star `Doll Face' Carroll (Vivian Blaine) publishes her autobiography entitled `Genius De Milo' and then goes on to star in a Broadway show based on it.  Perry Como and Carmen Miranda sparkle in fine supporting roles but for fans of the sorely underrated Vivian Blaine this film is a sheer delight.  This was based on a book written by Louise Hovick (aka Gypsy Rose Lee, the legendary burlesque artiste and raconteur).

Blaine is perhaps still best-known and remembered for two roles: as Miss Adelaide in the 1950 original Broadway production of GUYS AND DOLLS (which she subsequently got to reprise in the film version); and Emily in the 1945 film of Rodgers and Hammerstein's STATE FAIR.  Blaine had a very successful career as a nightclub and cabaret artist, but Hollywood fame strangely alluded her.  Fox initially tried to market her as their next big musical leading lady when Alice Faye announced her retirement.  Audiences sadly never quite latched onto her, more's the pity.

My only gripe is the horrid sound quality, which is muffled and full of hiss.  The picture quality is average (seems to be taken from a VHS master) but from Alpha what else can you expect?

539354,4,6303038875,"In a way an interesting film about the world of drama-entertainment in New York, with the strict division between  noble  musicals and  unmentionable  burlesque, except that burlesque ? being a lot more fragile and a lot less valorized by the  worthy  audience, is a hothouse for all kinds of flexible and at times very creative shows, songs, ideas, artists. When one is hungry and poor one has a natural tendency to move on, to invent, to attract attention, to be what one has never been and what others have never been either. Whats more the film is also about some social issues, particularly women and their position in the confrontation they live every day with men. Men appear as being ruffians, a little bit rough on the edges and definitely tactician sexual climbers taking advantage of any opportunity appearing in their vision. Women are depicted as more faithful, more attached to permanence and deeper feelings. This little film is in many ways one of the roots of the theme developed in  Moulin Rouge  though a lot less dramatically and emotionally. A good entertainment that shows how the burlesque can take its revenge on upperclass showbusiness.

539424,5,6303038875,"I purchased a VHS version of this movie some years ago because I was doing some research on Carmen Miranda around the time of her Centennial - 2009. That was the first time I came across this film which had Carmen in a small role, compared to her other wonderful musicals. At first I was somewhat dissapointed, yet after watching the film again, I realized that there was something special and vaguely familiar about the story line. Hence I did a Wikipedia Search and found out something quite significant about this movie. Here is the scoop:

The story was actually a stage ""play"" written under the title ""The Naked Genius"". Wikipidia continues:
""The Naked Genius is a 1943 American play written by Gypsy Rose Lee, produced by Mike Todd and starring Joan Blondell as Honey Bee Carroll. The play was performed 36 times between 21 October and 20 November in 1943 at the Plymouth Theatre. The play was later adapted into the 1946 film Doll Face directed by Lewis Seiler and starring Vivian Blaine.""

In the story, there are some of the same elements that you find in the dramatic life story of Miss Gypsy Rose Lee. Those elements we, whom love musicals will remember: ""Gypsy"", the famed musical based on her 1957 memoirs by Jule Styne, Stephen Sondheim and Arthur Laurents. Gypsy is once more back on stage and will be opening in another week (February 2014) at the Chicago Shakespeare Theatre. Wouldn't it be a fantastic experiment to take this piece written by Miss Gypsy Rose Lee and turn it into a Broadway Musical Stage Play today! Hope someone get the idea and do something with it!",1390694400,,1586,4.681003584229391

539478,4,6303038875,"I've always had a soft spot for DOLL FACE, Twentieth Century-Fox's 1946 musical treat starring Vivian Blaine, Carmen Miranda and Perry Como.  So when I heard that Fox was finally going to release their own pristine print on DVD, I was thrilled to finally junk my old Alpha public domain copy.

The plot for DOLL FACE was derived from a story entitled ""The Naked Genius"" written by renowned burlesque legend Gypsy Rose Lee (aka Louise Hovick).  Vivian Blaine stars as stripper Doll Face Carroll, whose ghostwritten autobiography ""Genius De Milo"" becomes the catalyst for her talents to shine on Broadway.  Along the way there's a rivalry between the two men in the Doll's lovelife (Dennis O'Keefe and Stephen Dunne); and some fun musical numbers with Carmen Miranda (""Chico Chico"") and Perry Como (""Here Comes Heaven Again"", and his classic ""Dig You Later (A-Hubba Hubba Hubba)"").

After enduring fuzzy, washed-out PD prints for years, it's a revelation to finally watch DOLL FACE in it's authorized studio version.  This is Vivian Blaine's show all the way, and she has an infectious, fun-loving role as Doll Face Carroll.  Carmen Miranda's a hoot as well.

Bonus features include Carmen Miranda's deleted musical number ""True to the Navy"", a mini commentary track from historian John Cork, photo galleries and the trailer.  Welcome home, Doll Face!

Available separately or as part of Fox's Carmen Miranda Collection box-set (which also boasts ""If I'm Lucky"", ""Greenwich Village"" and ""Something for the Boys"" in addition to a colour-corrected remaster of ""The Gang's All Here"").",1244592000,2,1579,5.1568627450980395
539479,4,6303038875,"Doll Face is a fairly good movie musical from Twentieth Century-Fox. The acting is rather convincing with the exception of Perry Como who appears rather stiff and uncomfortable; I just get the sense he held back a lot when he was on screen. The plot moves along at a good pace and the musical numbers are staged and choreographed very well. The cinematography is also very well done. The print quality is excellent although I am left wondering why they didn't film this in color.

When the action starts, we quickly meet Mary Elizabeth ""Doll Face"" Carroll (Vivian Blaine), a burlesque queen who comes to a ritzy Broadway theater with her boyfriend and stage manager Michael Francis ""Mike"" Hannegan (Dennis O'Keefe). She's trying out for Flo Hartman's (Reed Hadley) new operetta called ""Park Avenue;"" but even though they like her Hartman won't hire her because she's a burlesque queen. Naturally, Doll Face and Mike are upset--until Mike gets the idea that Doll Face should write a book to prove that she's got class, ""true"" cultured talent and loads of sophistication. When Doll Face expresses her doubts to Mike that she can write such a book; Mike simply says they'll hire a ghost writer and pay him off to make it look as if Doll Face had truly written her autobiography.

But trouble starts when the ghostwriter, Frederick Manly Gerard (Stephen Dunne), sees Doll Face; he begins to fall for her. At first, Doll Face refuses his advances and keeps everything strictly business even though Mike starts to feel threatened. Mike also gets sporadic advice from Chita Chula (Carmen Miranda), who also works in Mike's burlesque show. For a while things go fairly well--until Fred and Doll Face get stuck on the water in a boat when all Fred and Doll Face wanted to do was get to the publisher who lives on a small island off Jamaica Bay. Naturally, Mike misinterprets all this and he dumps Doll Face; she's pretty angry too and a romance does begin to blossom between Doll Face and Fred.

Of course from here the plot can go anywhere. At one point, Mike thinks that maybe they can put on their own show after Doll Face's book comes out; maybe they don't need to be in any Hartman show to be on Broadway--will this work out? Especially with these complications, that could be dicey. Will Doll Face ever patch things up with Mike--or will she accept Fred's offer of marriage and remain with Fred after all? And what about Nicky Ricci (Perry Como) who wants to go out with chorus girl Frankie Porter (Martha Stewart)--will he ever be able to catch her eye? Watch and find out!

The DVD comes with a few extras. There is a deleted scene with an optional commentary for that scene; and the stills gallery is very nicely done.

Doll Face is a ""B"" movie musical that could have been an ""A"" rated film if only Fox had given it its due. The musical numbers, especially the ones that feature Carmen Miranda and Vivian Blaine, are very good but without color they lacked that certain ""something extra."" However, this film isn't all that bad; and we do get fine acting from all except Perry Como who really sings much more than he acts or dances. If you like classic movie musicals, you should at least consider adding this one to your collection. Of course, fans of the actors in this movie would do well to get this DVD.",1243382400,,3308,4.628620102214651

539482,3,6303038875,"The 1946 movie Doll Face has finally been released by 20th Century Fox in pristine form. I have seen this movie many times(too many)on tv in either trincated and/or very washed out form. This print however is crisp and very clean and 20th Century is to be congratulated on its' efforts here.
Having said that however the movie itself is not one that holds up very well. There are countless others of this time period with as trivial a plotline as this that DO hold up very well(see ""Down Argentine Way"" or ""Weekend in Havana"").However ""Doll Face""'s plot unfortunately falls flat more often than not and in the end is not as satisfying as it might otherwise be. Also Dennis O'Keefe's tough guy persona overwhelms the rest of the casts'characters so much that at times he proves to be a distraction from the others,dominating every scene he is in. The rest of the characters seem to just react to him and there are no others that come across quite as strong to balance things out. Besides this was a lower budget film and there are no actors of the caliber here of a Don Ameche or Alice Faye to give the film the extra pizzazz it so badly needs .
The film,based VERY loosely on a Gypsy Rose Lee book,involves the story of a burlesque queen(pronounced ""burly-Q"" by O'Keefes' character).As the film opens she is auditioning for a legit stage show. When she is turned down because of who she is(burlesque houses were considered by many of the time to be just a hop,skip and a jump from Satan's door!) her manager/sweatheart gets the idea of writing a book to make it appear she has as much class as anyone. They enlist the help of a rather snobbish writer who though reluctant because of its' subject matter eventually agrees to do it when he meets his subject(matter).The writer and subject get stranded when their boat stalls and the manager tracks them down and of course ends up with the wrong idea. He spilts with her on the spot and leaves the writer to finally getthisclose with her. Farther along she tries to stage a show based on her bestselling book but it seems her old boyfriend has to relinquish some of his previous control of her re their old contract. In the end the two get back together and the show goes on.
There are some very good musical numbers throughout but of course I give the inimitable Carmen Miranda the first prize here. She has only one number but was a joy in every number she was ever in and this one was no exception. There is also an extra Miranda number included in the special features section that was excised from the movie that is great to see. There is also a precious moment that has Carmens'character reacting to the mention of someone getting one Carmen Miranda to play a part.
The others in the cast also sing quite respectfully here and there and of course there's Perry Como. Perry had a wonderful voice and does sings his numbers well but he looks too stiff and self concious which unfortunately detracts from his performances and does nothing to enhance the picture.
All in all this picture,while worthy to film buffs,is not one that stands up well for a general audience today. If this picture did not have Carmen Miranda in it I doubt whether the film would be worthy of much interest at all. Also some might find today,mentions in the dialogue by O'Keefes'character of men having to use their fists to keep their girls in line,a little testing to say the least. The film has been restored wonderfully and does have some good moments,mostly with Miranda,but it was a B-grade picture then and it is still one now.",1228694400,,3560,4.555382215288612
539483,4,6303038875,"This post-war musical marked the eventual end of CARMEN MIRANDA'S contract with FOX. Once the highest paid actress in Hollywood in the early 40s, she was now reduced to B&W and just ONE Production number. In the height of her fame and popularity at FOX she had 3 musical/production numbers many with lavish sets and costumes and...in TECHNICOLOR!! However after the war,her novelty begain to wear thin with the public...with the ""GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY"" with tropical/Brazilian themes over, Fox had less interest in promoting her in future films. Her contract had a few years to go so she did two B&W ""B"" type musicals for FOX. This one ""DOLL FACE"" has been beautifully restored, and after looking at all the bad prints that were in Public Domain this transfer is superb!...like a totally new film...more detail and so much 1940s Nostalgia. As in other of my reviews I'll not go into the story line. There are many good songs in this film which showcases VIVIAN BLAINE(she herself now reduced to B&W). PERRY COMO has some great songs...lots of beautiful showgirls as well. The one production number for Carmen and the only time she sings in this film is called ""CHICO"" a somewhat lavish production number(how great if it had been in COLOR!)with Carmen singing and dancing her heart out in a tropical setting. She put so much into this number that she fractured her ribs, also getting a splinter in her bare foot (no platforms here!)that became infected. There was to be two production numbers...the other ""SHE'S ALWAYS TRUE TO THE NAVY"" was unfortunately cut from the film. It must have been cut late in the pre-release as most all the advertising, lobby cards and photos shows Carmen in her risque costume with the lighthouse on her head. Trivia has stated that the reason it was cut was due to the song rights owned by PARAMOUNT and they would not allow FOX to use what was Carmen's most'campy'production number. However, another and more acceptable reason was with the censors that felt that Carmen's number was too 'risque' and showed the U.S. Navy in a poor light...also Carmen's mis-pronounciation of the word ""GENTLE""...hilarious!!!! MAY HAVE ALSO CAUSED A PROBLEM, HOWEVER, I THINK IT WENT OVER THEIR HEADS! Check it out! Only from CARMEN! This 'lost' complete production number unearthed from the FOX vaults is fortunately inserted in the 'SPECIAL FEATURES' on this disc as are some wonderful production and portrait stills.

The scenario has as its primary business a rocky romance between Doll Face Carroll (Blaine), a burlesque queen, and her manager, Mike Hannegan (the stalwart Dennis O'Keefe), along with the latter's efforts to boost his proletarian prot&eacute;g&eacute; into the realm of operetta. Seiler manages to remain faithful to the story line while seamlessly blending in the many musical numbers which, interestingly enough, prove more of a showcase for the perky Stewart and smooth Como than for the top-billed and certainly very pleasant Blaine; the production number for Miranda is a wild one, indeed.",1156809600,,974,5.456953642384106

7835238,4,6303038875,"Accept only the official 2008 ""Marquee Musicals"" restoration of DOLL FACE, where the visual elements are crisply luminous B/W and the sound elements sound freshly minted for the solid but short Adamson-McHugh score. Most Fox musicals are interchangeable with the predictable artistic components Grable-Faye-Payne-Ameche (and the artistic freer spirits Carmen Miranda or Busby Berkeley as big bonuses), but this optimistic postwar programmer directed by Lewis Seiler, while definitely non-PC and datedly hip, is a unique standalone with its modest Foxiness accredited only by Carmencita--playing a Brazilian Eve Arden wisecracker--and Vivian Blaine, playing an autobiographical variant on Gypsy Rose Lee.

The source is Rose Hovick's stageplay NAKED GENIUS (recall that Bill Wellman had already filmed Gypsy Rose's whodunit as LADY OF BURLESQUE) which had starred Joan Blondell. Blaine is fetchingly bright but not bawdy in the title role, and Dennis O'Keefe--here at a career peak with parallel and lovingly crafted films for Allan Dwan and Anthony Mann--is funny and brash, a burlesque impresario who learns along with Blaine and Miranda that their grubby bump-and-grind performance genre actually has classy roots in commedia dell'arte and possibly even a connection to the classical tragedienne Eleonora Duse, who was not known to bump or grind.

O'Keefe does not sing, but the barebones five-song score is very competently handled by Blaine, Miranda, Perry Como and Martha Stewart in her film debut. Carmencita's fully staged production number ""Chico chico"" is a knockout, particularly when the film frames are very slightly speeded up for her manic dance routine. (This restoration reinstates her dropped showcase ""True to the Navy,"" famous for her lighthouse headdress.) The remaining four songs, including Como's nerdy-hipster hit ""Dig you later,"" are variously recycled among the principals as solos and ensembles, making economical use of the short score-in-progress and emphasizing the O'Keefe troupe's morphing from 14th Street Minsky disrepute into Broadway respectability and pricier Todd/Shubert/Ziegfeld showmanship circles. ""All the world's a stage,"" per the Bard, and only the stage configuration (a Minsky runway vs. a Ziegfeld stairway) truly distinguishes burlesque from legit, these theatrical class distinctions beginning to blur even in Gypsy Rose's era.

There are bargain-basement themes of failed Broadway tryouts here that prefigure the much greater BAND WAGON, and the Rose Hovick connections are particularly intriguing, with both Blaine and Stewart presenting respectable runway turns (in picture hats and body stockings but no bumps or grinds) in song presentations that mimic Gypsy Rose's tastefully teasing stage exits clawing the Minsky draperies. Carmen Miranda is even more irresistible still, reliably stopping the show (whether burlesque or legit) as the brightest lighthouse ever to illuminate the noirishly bedimmed Fox soundstages. Carmencita was a unique ensemble comedienne, as memorable in this lustrous b/w context as in the much gaudier GANG'S ALL HERE or SOMETHING FOR THE BOYS, and DOLL FACE with its rarer cast roster is equally collectable in this vault-quality restoration.",1468713600,,3224,5.754716981132075

7835242,3,6303038875,"Doll Face (Vivian Blaine) is a ""Burleycue Queen.""  She wants to improve her status and her boyfriend (Dennis O'Keefe) willingly encourages her out of his theater and into someone else's.  As pal Chita Chula (the incomparable Carmen Miranda) points out, why are you trying to give your star performer to another producer!?  The lack of logic where the script is concerned is galling.  Naturally, it follows a well-worn pattern as boy loses girl and star to a shallow schmuck (Stephen Dunne as Frederick Manly Gerard, a writer with a bloated ego).  Toss in a few forgettable tunes and waste the considerable talents of Carmen Miranda and what have you got?  A run of the mill musical that keeps using the same songs ad nauseam.  Everyone and their dog sings Somebody's Walking in My Dream!!!  As for the tune Dig You Later (A-Hubba Hubba Hubba), with the immortal lyrics: ""It was mighty smoky over Tokyo!  A friend of mine in a B-29 dropped another load for luck, as he flew away, he was heard to say:""A hubba-hubba-hubba yuk yuk!""  Ouch.  But not nearly as problematic as the advice O'Keefe keeps giving Perry Como.......that you need to ""sock"" a woman to keep her in line.  ""That's the way to handle women, treat them rough!""  Welcome to 1945.

For all that, the worst offense was not utilizing Carmen Miranda.  They gave her only one number late in the movie (her other number was cut in favor of Vivian Blaine warbling the same tune!).
