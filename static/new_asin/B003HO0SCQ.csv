8541609,5,B003HO0SCQ,Easier to buy these then collect off cable. Getting them in order helps the series make more sense. Looking forward to getting the rest,1355788800,,135,4.666666666666667
8541610,1,B003HO0SCQ,poor fulfillment of my order. i would not buy from amazon again. all three dvds i ordered were listed as in stock and should have been sent at the same time. that is not happening. i cannot review the dvd if they haven't correctly fulfilled the order. the three dvds were ordered as a birthday present.next time i will try walmart and see if they are any better. i cannot easily find a way to complain to amazon so i guess this is the place to post my disappointment with amazon and say i will not order from them again.,1305676800,,520,4.21
8541611,5,B003HO0SCQ,"This movie is based on the early morning cartoon Bakugan Brawlers, and resolves many of the questions my grandson had about Bakugans.  He throughly enjoyed watching this movie, and will watch it many times over.  Well worth the price in entertainment value.",1282003200,3,257,5.095238095238095
