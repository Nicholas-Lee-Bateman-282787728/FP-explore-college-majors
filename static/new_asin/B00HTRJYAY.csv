8635703,5,B00HTRJYAY,"Paul Wilson is one of the best golf instructors, especially when it comes to the full swing. I am not saying that the others are not good but Paul Wilson presentation is great in the ""Swing Machine"" videos. If you check out his videos on YouTube, Revolution Golf or his site Ignition Golf you can get a good sample of his style at no cost.

His concept is based on ""Iron Byron"" using circular rotation, unrestricted hinge and constant forward tilt. He teaches you how to apply this to your full swing. Paul explains the 3 elements of Iron Byron with emphasis on staying loose, relaxed and swinging easy without tension (unrestricted hinge). The other things are lower body movement in the downswing (circular rotation) and staying on plane (constant forward tilt).

Most of what he teaches is the classic swing but maybe presented in a more simplified way. He does not teach impact because he feels you should always swing from point A to B and the ball should just get in the way. I resisted this for awhile and found I was making to big a deal about weigh shift (lateral movement) and ball compression. This exist his swing style but he doesn't want you to think or worry about it. I think this is a good idea for the full swing for beginners and some seasoned amateurs.

He does talk about restricting your hips on the backswing which I read a similar things in Ben Hogan ""5 Lessons"" and Jim McLeans ""X Factor"" but I don't restrict my hips at all (I'm an over 50 golfer) and maybe this is OK since it gets my shoulder to 90 degrees.  They key is torque or tension created between your upper and lower body. In Jack Nicklaus book ""Golf My Way"" he said ""the hips must turn"". I am not sure which is correct but turning my hips with no restriction on the backswing works for me. I can say there is some hip turn on every backswing but how much is not clear to me, so I guess it depends.

The presentation is very good and his knowledge is of the highest order. Paul will ""beat you over the head"" with ""3 Elements of Iron Byron"" in the videos but if things are going wrong for you it is because one or more these elements are missing in your swing.

I learned a lot from Paul Wilson and constantly refer back to his principle teaching of the full swing. When I am having problems on the tee I refer back to the three element and I can get back on track.",1402185600,9,2351,4.295711060948081
