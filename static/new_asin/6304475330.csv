8323793,5,6304475330,I loved this video so much as I kid.  I checked it out from my local library more times than than I can remember.  Does anyone know where to find it on DVD nowadays?  I don't even own a VHS player anymore.,1440979200,,205,3.8333333333333335

8323795,5,6304475330,"This video is a must for train buffs!  It has everything a train  enthusiast wants in a video:  solid information coupled with stunning  footage of some of the most interesting train runs in the world, as well as  clips from ""the good old days"" of railroading.  The video  provides a good historical perspective of railroading and the advent of  steam engines, moving along briskly to bring the viewer up to modern times.  Because it was produced in the early 80's, some of the material may be a  little dated, but a true rail fan won't be bothered by this aspect.  The  video is produced in the classic informative and easy-to-watch style which  is the hallmark of National Geographic Videos.  If you love trains, you  won't be disappointed.",962668800,29,742,4.732283464566929
