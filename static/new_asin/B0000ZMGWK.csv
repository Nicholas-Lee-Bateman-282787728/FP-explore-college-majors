1964284,5,B0000ZMGWK,"I read the book years ago, when it was not my usual reading material, the place I bought the book might even be considered trashy, but it was new, I wanted something hot, and *irony* was a word that it used on the first page in an interesting fashion.  The more I read, the more I kept looking for humor, and the more humor I found.  My hearing is not great, so some noisy movie scenes in the subway might have had whispering women's voices saying things to each other like, ""That man--he's a trisexual,"" a comment that was overheard on a train in the book.  I didn't hear it when I saw the movie today, but a lot of things in the movie reminded me of the book.  The subway cars actually had excerpts from poems, instead of just ads above the windows, and the main character is an English teacher who is as interested in words as in the book.  Being bombarded with romantic messages helps move the plot along at a nice clip.
Being a teacher is an aspect of her character that is emphasized so much, most of the minor characters seem to be trying to get the part of teacher's pet.  The most ironic moment in the movie for me was watching a hyper, stressed Kevin Bacon play a character that asks her if she could take care of his dog, since he has to be at the hospital 18 hours a day as an intern (he used to be an actor playing a doctor in a soap opera, so he decided to become one).  The request is as psychotic as any student trying to get his teacher to take a pet off his hands, if not more so.  Who wouldn't feel morbid if a teacher asked, ""When are you going to put the dog down?""  If you can't tell what Kevin Bacon would think, go see the movie and he'll tell you.
I shouldn't be giving away so many high points, but the effort to solve some serial murders seems to be creepy enough that it might even involve using the teacher as bait.  If the detective was trying to use the teacher as bait to get enough circumstantial evidence to convict the killer, the movie is almost as crazy as if the killer would have gone after her anyway.  Reading the book, the teacher seemed to be as clueless as the reader until the evidence takes the form of fear which must be more real than fake.  This is a frightful movie, and the squeamish might be squirming through messy parts in the beginning, middle and end, but the end makes more ideas, themes, and things fit together and fall into place on this movie's learning curve than would be likely in real life.  So many scenes were thrown together too quickly for comfortable cogitation, but the really great scenes come back later to be perfectly explanatory.  Though the silent scene on the skating pond in which the teacher's father proposed to the teacher's mother (and gave her a ring) is initially far removed from the main plot, the final recap of that pond scene is chilling in a frightening way, providing an unexpected emotional parallel to the main story.",1067558400,2,2911,4.29798903107861
1964285,5,B0000ZMGWK,"I just came back from watching this movie about an hour ago and wanted to write a review while it's still fresh in my mind.  Before anything else, let me just say, Meg Ryan's performance is SPECTACULAR!  It's nothing short of breathtaking.  I think this is the performance of her career.  Ryan boldly sheds her previously earned image as ""Amercia's Sweetheart"", and completely reinvents herself for this movie.  This time, Ryan plays a quiet, sullen, reserved inner city schoolteacher; her character is a contradiciton, introverted and subdued yet at the same time just SEETHING with dark, delicious, pent-up sensuality.  I mean, if you're a heterosexual male, you just GOTTA see her!  Dayam!  Ryan's character ""Frannie"" is complex and multifaceted, as is the film; it was a risk, but it works.  As Eber said, Ryan's performance is utterly flawless.  It by itself is completely worth the price of admission, and will direct all attention away from any inadequacies in the plot :-)
Okay, Meg Ryan aside, the movie was a solid thriller that kept me guessing all the way to the end.  The obligate murders are gruesomely described, but actual gore on screen is kept at a tasteful minimum.  The plot at times border on derivative and uninspired for this genre, but by and large it was tight enough to serve as an adequate vehicle for Ms. Ryan to burn the screen with her presence.  (I know, I promise to stop ranting about her).
Director Jane Campion did an outstanding job with the cinematography and the general feel of the film.  For example, the camera is deliberately out of focus around the edges during certain scenes, giving the film a surrealistic, dreamy yet visceral feel.  Again, this was a risk that surprisingly worked for me.  Symbolism in the film is rich and beautiful, especially the poetry written on the subway train walls, read by Ryan's sultry voice in her mind.
And finally, I'd just like to mention that Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is also a dangerously skilled actress (just watch ""Single White Female"" or ""Washington Square"") was tragically underused in this film.  At her best, Leigh is every bit as good an actress as Ryan, but she simply wasn't given the chance to shine in this movie.  For the role of Frannie's sister Pauline, a lesser actress would have done the job, which could have been done instead of wasting Leigh's precious time :-)  But I'm still always glad to see her on screen as well.
In closing, if you're even remotely a fan of Meg Ryan, go see this film now!  Don't wait, do it now!  You WON'T be disappointed.  Oh man, Meg Ryan will be in my dreams tonight... ;-)",1067558400,88,2604,4.7272727272727275
1964286,4,B0000ZMGWK,"In the Cut is only for those who adore Jane Campion's creations.  This film should have never been released to the general movie audience.  It is meant for the so-called intellectually  elite cappuccino crowd willing to pretend that they enjoy endless Freudian style dialogue.  Campion's forte is the making of  movies where women get in touch with their sexuality.  The now 41 year old Meg Ryan is obviously desperate to abandon her previous good girl roles.  Not only does she appear nude, but Ryan engages in a number of simulated sexual scenes.  In the Cut is borderline pornography.  Sigh, why do so many actresses approaching middle age opt to put themselves through all this abuse?  Is keeping together a career that important?
Campion, however, must be credited with putting together a visually beautiful work.  This murder mystery  concerns a perpetrator who obviously has unresolved sexual issues.  Only attractive young women are selected to be dismembered.  All the men in Frannie Avery's (Meg Ryan) life are strange to say the least.  This woman is a magnet for every weirdo in the neighborhood.  Even her soon to be lover Detective James Malloy (Mark Ruffalo) seems capable of psychotic mayhem.  An actress who never disappoints, Jennifer Jason Leigh, is splendid as a loser who finds love in all the wrong places.  Kevin Bacon portrays a guy who requires a lot of therapy. Unfortunately, never for a moment do we believe that Frannie would have given this over-the-top character the time of day. In the Cut needed to be shortened by about ten minutes.  The pace is far too slow.  I can only give it 3 1/2 stars.  Jane Campion is too heavy handed with the theme of sexuality.  A lighter and more subtle approach would have have been more appropriate.",1067558400,4,1764,4.8686868686868685
1964287,2,B0000ZMGWK,"""In the Cut"" is an excruciating ""erotic thriller"" (or that's what it was at least going for) about a college professor who becomes involved with a New York City homicide detective investigating a string of grisly murders.
Would have been great to see Meg Ryan change her chick-flick love-comedy stereotype for something more meaningful, but this unnecessarily coarse script isn't it. Not even with the same stylish visual rubric that ""The Piano"" was wrapped in (same director.)
Sadly, helped by an unremittingly cheerless script, this urban-noir tale suffocates under the weight of its own self-importance. Sleaze does not make substance, and outright lewd banality cannot be shrugged off under pretense of faux weightiness -- the obvious poverty of this script is still evident through the liberal dose of raunchy sex scenes and pretentious dialogue.
May be a worthwhile rental, but I wouldn't cancel any plans for it.",1067472000,3,919,5.258503401360544
1964288,5,B0000ZMGWK,"To be honest, I kind of thought the movie was going to be bad (I didn't like the book), but I went to see it anyway, since I learned that Jane Campion was the director. Having seen and loved her ""Angel at my Table,"" ""The Piano,"" and ""Holy Smoke,"" I was interested in finding out why exactly this independent New Zealand director left Australia and went, so to speak, ""Hollywood."" Well, it turns out that Campion was only doing a favor for Nicole Kidman, who was going to play the lead role (Nic decided against it later on, and became one of the executive producers instead).
The film itself is gorgeous to look at, although the camera work is a bit shaky, and there are like... hundreds of meaningless close-ups that can drive you totally crazy. And guess what, Meg Ryan DOES take her top off (if you're interested in that sort of thing). But this movie is also very violent and brutal; I heard it almost got an NC-17 rating (our censors cut out a seven-minute chunk of footage with most shocking sex and violence and rated the film R).
Basically, the story is about a somewhat attractive English teacher named Franny (played by Ryan), who suddenly finds herself in the middle of a police investigation when a girl is found murdered near her house. The lead detective working on the case meets and talks to her, and she's instantly attracted. Then, to make things even more complicated (as if the sexually unruly relationship between her and the police officer wasn't enough), Franny remembers that she saw the dead girl somewhere before.
The story is quite interesting, though the ending is fairly simple and predictable. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who loves ""romantic thrillers,"" but don't expect much from it. The acting is excellent (especially Ryan's), the cinematography is beautiful, the music is good, and the plot won't make you wanna yawn, and that's the important thing.",1066780800,93,1890,4.7477203647416415

Meanwhile, an unknown serial killer is slicing and dicing up chicks semi-linked to the main female character.

There was full shot nudity of Meg Ryan and there was no mosaic or cut at all for that shot. I think the governer must have sleeping by the time that shot was playing since Korean govenment are so notorious for censorship.
I bought this dvd like three years ago and didn't saw it untill last night.
This movie is not so good in terms of screenplay. The story is shabby and full of cliche. The murderer came out to be someone from nowhere and that was not even a pleasent surprise at all.
The relationship between Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo was kind of interesting and they did their job pretty well.
The sex scene was beautifully shot. I think Meg wanted to leave and preserve her beautiful body forever before she really become old through this movie by shooting her entire nude shot.
The color of each shots are carefully made by using all kinds of objects and the result was this beautiful mis-en -scene.

1964375,5,B0000ZMGWK,"I was very surprised by how much I liked this film. Reviews were mixed.
But the film is beautifully paced, and directed, by a master of the
medium. This is a worthy addition to Campion's oeuvre. The night- time
scenes outdoors in NYC are visually striking, especially when it is
raining. Meg Ryan's insecure, withdrawn, armored character was the
perfect foil for her ""charming"" sex-kitten roles. In this film she is a
mature woman coming to grips with issues of repression and sexuality.
Jennifer Jason Leigh's role as the wild sister is masterfully done as
well. And Mark Rufallo's hard-boiled detective is played to perfection.
The script is great as well. Nothing gratuitous occurs. The nudity and
sex scenes are believable and are erotic without being needlessly prurient or
overtly violent. They are believable and lovely. Perhaps this is because it is a woman who is directing the action in bed. Mark's character learned about sex as a teen, from an older woman who he regards kindly. He is respectful and caring
despite being 100% macho cop. Kevin Bacon is wonderful as a scorned -
and neurotic - lover. Sharrieff Pugh as a black student of Franny's is
both sensitive, aggressive, and compelling to watch. The only flaw that
I have with the film is that Franny (Meg) doesn't ask certain questions
that to the viewer seem obvious. But if she did ask them early on the
film would have been much shorter, and that would have been a shame.
While the plot has some obvious turns, there is enough tension to keep
the viewer involved. I won't answer the critics who didn't like the
movie. If you are a fan of film noir and don't mind nudity you will
love this film. I certainly did. I have no qualms about recommending
this to aficionados of the genre.",1443830400,,1752,4.691558441558442

She finds it with a police detective named Malloy, played by Mark Ruffalo, with a 3 of Spades tattooed on his wrist. Frannie secretly watched a man with the same tattoo get a very graphic bj from a woman who later is murdered. Malloy is assigned the case and Frannie suspects he might be the murderer. The initial sex scene between Frannie and Malloy is nice, and you get to see both stars naked, but the movie goes down hill from there. Little, if any, character development exists so it's hard to comprehend why Frannie and Malloy are attracted on each other. Frannie is so insular and Malloy so secretive that you never get to know either character so you don't understand their motivations or care what happens to them. This is not an action movie nor is it spellbinding. As mysteries go, it is a snoozer. To add insult to injury, there's nothing to explain or suggest what the title refers to.

Even the plot that is woven through a series of grisly murders couldn't hold one's attention when so heavily wrapped in the quasi-neurotic angst of a single woman in New York.

The oh so predictable ""surprise"" ending was absolutely worthy of a half-hour segment of a television cop show from the 70's.

1964433,3,B0000ZMGWK,"I actually liked this movie more than most of Meg Ryan's popular RomComs -- ""You've Got Mail,"" in particular, which I believe should have been called, ""You Have Mail,"" or rather, ""You Have Email"" -- which doesn't mean that this film was good.  It just means that her previous works were really overrated.

I met Dennis Quaid very briefly a long time ago at Parkers in Seattle, back when I was young enough to care about silly little things such as autographs.  (For the life of me now, I can't imagine waiting in line for anyone's autograph today, even if it were a line of one.)  He was playing with his band ""The Sharks"" perhaps.  The show was OK, but people were there to see a movie star, not a rock star.  A few people asked him about Ms. Ryan after the show, and he kept fairly mum about her.  We can surely guess why.

Well, it surely wasn't that he disliked this film, or his wife's performance in it, since ""In the Cut"" released quite a bit later.  In reality, I think that Ms. Ryan gets a bad rap a bit with regards to this film though.  If this film breaks into the standard three acts, then I would say act one falls flat.  I almost gave up.  But act two is actually pretty good.  Act three provides the standard switcheroo that I hate, but that was the fault of the writer or the director, not Ms. Ryan.  But I am a fan of Mark Ruffalo's; I really liked him in ""Zodiac.""  And he's fairly solid here, as usual.

Where I think that this film fails:  1.  It just seems that Ms. Ryan wanted to play against type so much that she took a film that wasn't the greatest vehicle to do that.  2.  This film tries to be quite ""artsy"" at times, and that didn't really work for me.  I think that the story was mildly interesting and I believe that they could have played it more straight.  3.  The standard switcheroo, discussed above, which bores me.

Too bad.  Ms. Ryan seemingly wanted to show that she could be more than ""America's Sweetheart.""  (And yes, I DETEST that little phrase that gets thrown around way too much.  Feminists, where are you to shut this one down?!?)  I just think that she should have chosen a better movie to go against standard type for her.

Everybody walked thru this film like they were zombies.  As far as dialogue--there is mostly silence, or short, very short sentences-- The screenwriter wrongly thinks this is way cool,BUT all appeared to be in a stupor of some kind.
Not one truely snappy,coherent personality. Strange.
  The camera angles made me want to turn off the movie,un-nerved because we see the back of their heads more than their faces.  Maybe this was supposed to be ""art"" ot something. So what we see is a lot of silent shots and the backs of heads. Come on! It was, to me, just dumb. Fire the director!
  In a few words, this was sex for the shock factor, while the story may have held your attention. Mainly tho, we are trying to figure out what the heck is supposed to be going on. And  we wait, hoping for clues to piece together this puzzle. What is it we view & hear? It doesn't really jell. Of couse in the last moment we know ""who dunnit"".
  We make assumptions, a plus for thrillers. But mostly we murmer ""huh""?  We are supposed to be kept somewhat ""in the dark""--Prepare for pitch black with this thiller.
  I'd say blame the director for Meg Ryan's worst performance to date, and Jennifer Jason Lee in an early performance suffered again having been subjected to horrific camera angles and direction..I wondered if the camera-man fell periodically asleep.
  Uncredited(!) in a decent portrayal as sort of a nut is Kevin Bacon!! Go figure.
  The supposedly ""sexy"" detective having a odd-ball relationship with Meg Ryan is an actor unknown to me, Mark Ruffalo--which a reviewer said in essence--any woman would fall into bed with.  Well, not this woman.  Nor Meg Ryan, no chemistry with her either.
  Many times watching this I said to myself ""Why am I watching this movie""?  Bottom line.  I think this probably was a GOOD story in book form, but WHY the director decided to mess it up signifigantly as a moody-mess of a nasty grungy flick is anybody's guess. Well, serial murders are hardly upbeat,I know--but this does NOT let up, not one moment of levity or anything but the  black-pits.
  This is just my opinion, of course! Anyway, from this female point of view, ""In The Cut"" touted as ""erotic"", (altho leaving nothing to the imagination,) was too ugly-sordid to set anything in motion.",1356134400,2,2410,4.625

1964446,3,B0000ZMGWK,"""In the Cut"" aspires to moody, up-scale literary neo-noir, but ends up as a cross between chatty chick flickery and warmed-over formula ""suspense."" Take some of the steamy elements from ""erotic thrillers"" like ""Never Talk to Strangers,"" ""Taking Lives,"" and ""Killing Me Softly,"" add a bit of urban grit and grime from just about any run of the mill police procedural, throw in a bunch of superfluous supporting characters with inscrutable motivations and dialog out of the most conventional produced-for-Liftetime TV movie you've ever seen, make it about forty minutes too long, and ""In the Cut"" is what oozes forth. While their all too brief encounter in the bedroom is incredibly steamy, what's left of the relationship between Ryan and Rufalo seems contrived and unconvincing; I cannot honestly see any educated self-respecting professional woman falling for such a foul-mouthed cretin. As to the plot? The Scooby gang could have cracked this ""mystery"" in a half hour; the red herrings are insultingly obvious and the ending--after nearly two hours--is pure pot-boiler, nearly bordering on brain-dead. This simply confirms my belief that Jane Campion is one of the most extravagently overrated directors of the last twenty years.

But Ruffalo steals the movie as tough detective who knows his way around the streets and women.

1964448,2,B0000ZMGWK,"I like a good movie for late night entertainment. As one of my sources of movies, I shop at Ross. Yes, I know it's a clothing store, but they have all sorts of things and one of them is a bargain basement DVD rack. It can have up to a hundred or more movies on it and the movies typically are under four dollars, sometimes much less. Well, in order to shop successfully in such an environment, you have to know a bit about movies and my knowledge is minimal. So, I make a guess and some of my big successes include ""Rock and Roll High School"" (funny, I've now watched it three times), ""Milk"" (excellent!), ""Motorama"" (weird, but fascinating), ""Mamma Mia"" (wonderful!), ""Steel Magnolias"" (excellent), ""We are Marshall"" (wonderful movie) and a variety of Clint Eastwood movies (all good). Of course, now and then there's a clinker.

One of my latest acquisitions was ""In the Cut"" (R-rated edition). I'd never heard of the movie. However, in looking over the DVD case, I discovered that the director was Jane Campion, the director of ""The Piano,"" a truly outstanding movie. That little fact got me to purchase.  Well, I lost on this one, folks. ""In The Cut"" is a dreadful movie and I had a hard time sitting through it. The local for the movie was New York City, and everything bad about NYC was amplified tenfold. The noise and the trash and the crowded conditions and the decrepit buildings were just overwhelming. I suppose this was intended, but I go to movies for entertainment not to look over somebody's absolutely dreary living conditions. Oh, and I didn't even mention the language. Do you like hearing the F-word used as a noun, verb, pronoun, adjective and adverb? Or there's loads of other dubious words. What's the purpose? Or is it just a way of creating a really dreary setting? Did I mention the meaningless sexual encounters?

Well, the story had to do with multiple murders of women who were then dismembered and cast about and two sleazebag NYC cops who were in charge of the investigation to capture the perpetrator. In the investigation, sleazebag one (Mark Ruffalo) meets up with Meg Ryan and the two have a sick affair as the investigation goes on. Doesn't it figure? Is the story exciting? Yaawwwnnnn! How can stuff like this get so acclaimed? The cinema was just awful, but I suspect that was intended, in which case they did a wonderful job of it and deserve an award. The sound was atrocious and I kept having to turn it up to get over the NYC background noise. The visual landscape was cluttered, to say the least. Yet, look over and read the reviews and you'll find some five-star awards. I have no quibble with that. It's artsy. Some people like to view artsy movies and the more dreary they are the better they are. Thanks, but no thanks.

1964449,2,B0000ZMGWK,"I saw this film on regular tv in the UK and wanted to buy a copy for a friend back in the States as I thought it made a real statement about women, how they think and feel, how they are seen and perceived and a lot about the women who made the film.  In the version I saw it was extremely explicit but very sensual and these scenes helped create the plot and atmosphere.  I was SOOOO disappointed with this R rated version - it was cut to ribbons and if you blinked you'd miss an essential plot point - it wasn't even worth giving to my friend as it is a travesty of the film I saw.

Perhaps I should have had the Director's Cut - but not being familiar with the differences, I assumed an R was what I had seen - if this is an R I can't help but wonder what the non R is like and how little it could offer in terms of nuance and atmosphere.",1323388800,,840,3.8439306358381504

1964451,3,B0000ZMGWK,"Maybe the full frontal of Meg Ryan and a little of Mark Ruffalo is what puts some off here. I found it a breath of fresh air, compared with most Hollywood thrillers. It's the usual murder mystery, and you know that all the red herrings put before us are just that, until the end, until the real killer is revealed as the one with the least amount of screen time. It was refreshing to see perky Meg Ryan looking her age here, though she reverts to her old self in the extra feature. No more baggy eyes and mousy hair and sagging breasts. Jennifer Jason Leigh, as far as I know, plays her real crazy self here. I have seen Mark Ruffalo in a number of his films and I really appreciate his acting. Very subtle. Kevin Bacon's small role as a rejected boyfriend who is losing his mind is actually the scariest thing in the movie. The soundtrack helps us know when to be scared and when not. This is off the beaten path for these people, so for that reason it's worth watching.",1305590400,,971,4.254054054054054
1964452,4,B0000ZMGWK,"I just want to thank Jane Campion for taking this ridiculous film and making it so erotically artsy and, in the same breath, giving Meg Ryan a reason to continue acting.  I mean, in all honesty, this movie really boils down to those two factors; and without either the film would have been dreadful.

Let's just get the bad out of the way.  The plot is preposterous.  The ending is terrible (not the `ending' ending, but the way that the whole `killer' thing is handled) and the situations conceived here are a total mess.  The characters dwell within stereotypes that the scripting couldn't weed out.  In the end the film SHOULD have been a total failure; a Lifetime movie waiting to be forgotten, but instead the film kind of works.

There is only one reason as to why, well...two to be exact.

Jane Campion is one of the greatest directors working today.  I keep putting off this piece for my blog I've been dying to write about her, so maybe this review will kick me into `writing mode'.  The point is though, Campion knows how to elicit a gut reaction from the audience.  She plays with sex like it was her best friend, and she knows how to bath scenes in enough erotic abnormality that we become entranced with each scene.  This film LOOKS amazing.  The way that she uses needless (as some would classify them) close-ups and sporadic shots of inanimate objects in order to lather the scenes with the glow of intimacy is outstandingly realized here.  Just watching people touch, no matter how innocent and unimposing the touch may be (I'm still haunted by the way Jennifer Jason Leigh drunkenly stroked Meg Ryan's wrist with her fingers), can find a way into your emotions.

Meg Ryan is one of my favorite actresses, but she has had a really bad decade.  In fact, her rising star and all that it promised has, sadly, been all but forgotten in light of her more erroneous film choices.

What she does in `In the Cut' is amazing.

As Franny, Ryan gets underneath the perverse naivety of her character, the curiosity that keeps her inching forward despite holding herself at bay when considering the inevitabilities of her situation; and the way she makes her characters preposterous fascination with the situation VERY believable is a testament to her commitment to the role.

While the film will hold onto your interest, mostly because you'll want to figure out just what is going on, it also fails to really deliver the goods.  The plotting and script work felt very amateurish and, in the end, felt like a `young adult mystery novel', which is never a good thing.  Still, Campion and Ryan sell this like hot cakes, elevating my better judgment and earning this film a B- grade from me.

Honestly, I wanted to keep watching it.",1298246400,4,2732,4.647916666666666
1964453,5,B0000ZMGWK,"I saw this last night. Some movies are meant to challenge. If some people can't handle adult material then they're welcome to insulate themselves, though it's more than likely they've already seen more objectionable material on the net.

This movie is not porno, it's not perverted; it's about as sick as real life itself is sometimes sick. The alienation of the two main characters is something they are facing within themselves so they can start living again... truly living. It's a gritty and realistic love story and it has a happy ended within the context of their lives. The sex is not sick, but the grisly murders are. Worse murders have happened in reality but this was bad enough and it's reflection of what can happen in real world situations. Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo's performances are outstanding. So is the direction and the cinematography. It's a film for adults who understand eroticism, emotional and physical hunger, alienation and loss... and Jane Campion does her usual outstanding direction in handling such adult material. It's a Five star film for those who can set their usual prejudices aside to watch how the two main characters learn to love, heal and understand each other under conspicuously tragic circumstances. Jennifer Jason Lee is outstanding as Ryan's sister, but let's not mistake the sometimes unsympathetic and unappealing nature of their roles as bad performances or a bad movie.

Quite simply the entire film is horrifying and exploitative- how can something be so seedy, violent, potty mouthed , scummy , exploitative ,cheezy and gross and yet still be unprovocative, uninteresting, and annoying ? Imagine for no reason whatsover you were dunked into a cesspool a few times , for no reason whatsoever, it was entirely random - enough that your clothes and hair were saturated with filth and yet you sustained no injuries and you were able to shower and change into fresh clothes immediately afterwards. No great disaster - but it gives you the creeps to think that that happened to you. That's how I feel about being in the same room with the media device while it played this film.

Frannie suspects Malloy, but Kevin Bacon's John Graham is a weird freak who she should also suspect.

1964459,2,B0000ZMGWK,"Two of the things that made ""Collateral"" such a success help this movie out considerably as well. They are  the gritty and grainy cinematography of Dion BeBe and a great performance from Mark Ruffallo. He plays a sexy detective named Malloy who may be as dangerous as he is seductive. He's on the trail of a serial killer who likes chopping up the bodies of his female victims and littering their body parts all over town. When severed limbs show up in Frannie Avery (Meg Ryan)'s garden she meets Malloy. He wants to question her regarding any strange or suspicious noises she may have overheard on the night of the murder. Before Malloy leaves he asks Frannie if they've met before. She tells him no even though she's convinced she saw him in a smoky bar receiving oral sex from a mystery woman. That woman is the murder victim in question. Frannie remembers him by a distinctive tattoo on his right wrist. Malloy begins following Frannie and she becomes so excited by his advances that she forgets about the mutilated corpse that was dumped outside her window. Frannie's half sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) does nothing to dissuade Frannie and pushes her to go out with Malloy. The two embark on a steamy affair but Frannie still has a lot of unanswered questions about her new lover. As more victims pop up and the people closest to Frannie start turning  violent she doesn't know who to trust. I wasn't that impressed with the film. Meg Ryan was certainly fearless in her performance and the sex scenes were good but I didn't find this film to be as erotic as it's made out to be.  I appreciate Jane Campion's attention to detail and stylistic choices even though they slow the movie down at times. However thanks to BeBe there are some gorgeous images in this film. One thing that I really enjoyed was the odd casting of Kevin Bacon as a man who is stalking Frannie. The two had a one night stand some time back and his obsession for her didn't end that night. He follows her every  move and a case is made that he could be the killer.

1964473,1,B0000ZMGWK,"I did not have any preconceived notions in mind when I picked this film up.  After reading the back, I figured it would be ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" with a thriller twist to it.  But frankly, it was just bad.  It went on too long.  It is never good when you think: When will this be over?

Meg Ryan gets kudos from me for trying something outside her rather limited range, but it was just weird.  She is supposed to be a sexualized, intelligent, loner teacher living in NYC.  Oxy moron?  She sees too much of a couple one afternoon, and then this woman ends up ""disarticulated.""  From this heinous act of violence, the story unfolds: woman meets cops, cop becomes infatuated, constant red herrings pop up all over.

Mark Ruffalo, is surprisingly convincing as a sexually degenerate cop (or maybe he was just supposed to be 'one of the guys'?).  Aside from the bad mustache, he was the shining light in this film.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is Meg Ryan's sister in a strange part, where frankly she never really fits in.  Kevin Bacon has a frightening 3 minutes, which are easily lost in the shuffle.

The film has too many red herrings, making it easy to figure out who the actual murderer is.  And frankly, the ending was boring.  It was predictable and has been done many, many times before.

I will leave you with this: if the idea of this film intrigues you, watch some old NYPD Blue episodes and then watch ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" both are head and shoulders above the acting and plot of this film.",1212624000,8,1500,4.476014760147602

Meg Ryan's talent was virtually nonexistant, and Ruffalo followed closely on her heels. And while the explicit sex was supposed to be erotic, the only thing it did was turn me off the entire movie and hate the indiviual actors instead. I've never really been a big Meg Ryan fan, but if this had been my first movie that I watched of hers, it is doubtful I'd ever give her a second chance. Quite simply, this is trash.

1964477,4,B0000ZMGWK,"Meg Ryan puts together an amazing performance that is up there with Linda Fiorentino in The Last Seduction, but this is not a movie to watch for a thrill.  It has a college English professor as the protagonist who quotes poetry at every opportunity.  If anything, it's film noir from the female perspective.  Instead of a femme fatale, the (possibly fatal) interest here is the detective who comes looking for Frannie.  Frannie doesn't trust him from the beginning (her first comment is ""Is that badge real?"" and she makes him wait outside until she can check with the station) but she'd like to.  Maybe.  Or maybe she'd like to believe he's a fake.  Her past choices haven't exactly been playing it safe.

So from the beginning, there's a question of trust, and how the dream of the other in a relationship can obscure the real person standing there, to the point where it's possible to accept the dream over the reality.

Frannie has no real connection to the world around her.  She loves, but can't really empathize with her sister.  Her father (seen only in her dreams) is thoughtless and carried away with romance.  And her relationships with men in general are fraught.  Frannie is so surrounded by damaged, dangerous men that the prospect of a serial killer is far less intimidating than a one night stand who has the key to her apartment and thinks he's her boyfriend.

So.  Awesome movie.  Not something anyone else is likely to do again, and although it's worthwhile, it's not exactly ""feel good.""  Unless you count the boobies.",1188518400,2,1538,4.743396226415094

1964482,3,B0000ZMGWK,"Jane Campion is a very interesting director of some substance and style.  In the Cut is a good trashy entertaining summer read, not great literature.  The combination of the two results in a rather puzzling movie where the two elements wind up undermining each other.  The movie winds up being nowhere near as fun as the book and nowhere near as compelling as Campion's other films.

Susanna Moore's thin book goes by very quickly hinged on a very filmsy rudimentary thriller plotline and structure, the same as countless other relatively lazy suspense films of recent decades: protagonist meets sexy mysterious but dangerous other person amidst a pattern of killings.  Protagonist is attracted but suspicious that the object of their desire is responsible for the murders; who will turn out to be the killer?  Of course scattered throughout are red herring suspects and clues to send you in various directions and draw out the revelation of the truth as long as possible.  While the book had not much to recommend it with regard to the weak mystery or police procedural material at the core, it had a wonderfully oversexed quality and brazenness keeping you turning the pages and was well written enough in the details.  What presumably attracted Campion to the material was the book's clear-eyed and overt engagement with the tropes and types of male-female relationships in the mystery genre; an opportunity to cast a feminist eye on a dynamic of violence and victimization, of the nature of attraction to danger (read masculine danger) and sexuality as self-expression.

An adaptation that recognized that the inherent weakness at the core of the book's mystery fatally undermines its deeper themes, and that instead played this material up for its lurid and sleazy qualities might have been truly fabulous and riveting.  But the choice of Campion in trying to pursue the serious side goes in the opposite direction and I think is the wrong choice.  She renders the world of New York and the characters with a tremendous amount of seriousness and gravity despite the fact that the plot events are completely farfetched and terribly silly; adding touches of realism to a completely unrealistic storyline and dialogue doesn't produce a more realistic movie, just a confused one.  Campion adds a few personalized moments here (like a new backstory about the main character's father with some surreal fantasy imagery, a half-sister dynamic missing from the book where the same character is just a friend) but not enough of her own material to move the film away from the formulaic main storyline into a deeper examination of the supposed themes.  Ryan is shot and made up to look as average and mundane as she could be genetically; while such a strategy makes sense to me in a movie like Monster, in the fantasy land that is this implausible storyline, what is to be gained by this approach?  Ryan's purposefully unglamorous look winds up almost a distraction, as is an extended cameo from Kevin Bacon, where it's hard to think anything else besides ""Oh there's Kevin Bacon.""

The ending of the book is, as you might expect, tampered with; besides the box office reasoning, it was hard to imagine Campion ending the film the way the book does.  The book's sex scene in the police station is also missing, perhaps unsurprisingly.  Otherwise, the film is perhaps too faithful to the book really.  Either Campion should have dispensed with pursuing the rather lame whodunit at the heart of this film and gone totally serious doing a film about lonely people looking for sex or someone else should have done this movie as pulpy sleaze noir; it just winds up with too little of everything to be really successful.

Although I assume that potential viewers already interested in this movie are unlikely to be prudes, you should be aware that the unrated cut of this movie contains a graphic and very real depiction of a sexual act not usually allowed in mainstream films (and it does not involve Meg Ryan incidentally).  I appreciate the motivation for including the sequence, since the moment is pivotal to the narrative and the change in Ryan's character, but the very real shot of a sex act did have the odd effect by its inclusion of making the subsequent sex scenes between Ryan and Ruffalo seem rather staged and fake in comparison.",1170028800,5,4332,4.916323731138546
1964483,3,B0000ZMGWK,"The first few minutes are not impressive at all, just another story about a serial killer and a scared woman meant to another victim, but surely escaping certain death in the last moment. A was about to turn it off,  just was curious to know who the bad guy is. Surprisingly, the story was so twisted, I couldn't figure it out right away. The plot is surreal. Some things look familiar but the whole scenes make no sense. Some touches like a girl sleeping in front of the open working fridge are quite puzzling. Pretty much all male characters are worthy serial killer material and the victim turned out to be not that scared either.

After I made it to the middle of the movie it became obvious that depsite of all blood and killings, it's not the cheap violence attracting attentions. Actually, the plot is quite absurd and can be summarized in a couple lines (I won't do it of course) but it is really creative in details and the actors play is quite sophisticated (but has nothing to do with realism).

Overall, if you like ""true story"" movies, this one is probably not for you. If you find surrealism or modern art attractive, give it a try. The movie is not an Oscar level by far, but it has bright sides.",1168819200,2,1211,4.42152466367713

More bodies appear and Frannie has reason to be suspicious that the cop she is attracted to is the killer.

In the Cut is a dull movie. The mystery of the killer's identity is spread out so thinly over the whole movie, there is no suspense when you figure out who it is. The sex scenes between Ryan and Ruffalo are gloomy and forced. I didn't believe the supposed attraction between the two. There are a lot of arty set pieces in the film to try and trick you into thinking there is some important subtext here, but there isn't.

1964485,4,B0000ZMGWK,"A good thriller but lacking the police expertise we expect from thrillers today. It all hinges on one detail that the main woman knows and does not communicate to the main cop : a tattoo that this main cop wears. She is of course right to believe this is a detail that identifies the killer, but she is wrong because there is nothing more or less common than one particular tattoo. And she causes at least one death and puts herself in jeopardy. The rhythm of the film is intense and intensely punctuated with sex, or sexually explicit scenes, though they remain tamed in spite of this explicitness. The point is to know why she makes this mistake of not telling the cop the element that identifies the killer. Because she thinks that particular cop is the criminal ? That's too simple. In fact there is in her the common reaction that leads most people to not telling the cops what they know because they do not trust them, what's more if there is something ambiguous about one particular cop. But that has to be still a lot more deeper with this particular girl. She is typical of a mature woman in one big city like New York : to be autonomous and independent from men, not to be afraid of anything, particularly danger, etc. In a word to keep one's business to oneself, one's thoughts secret and one's doubts or suspicion unrevealed. This kind of internalized feeling and attitude of independence and freedom can become extremely dangerous, particularly for women, and that is the message of the film. Luckily she had the gun of her cop-friend at the right minute and time. But besides this warning to women, the police work of the film is reduced to little because of this coyness that blocks any kind of standard police investigation : it is true that if the cop had known that little detail the case would have been closed in about two quarters of one hour, i.e. in ten minutes on the screen.

1964486,1,B0000ZMGWK,"In the Cut (Jane Campion, 2003)

There is one valid reason to watch this debacle of a film, and that is that the soundtrack was done by the wonderful Hilmar Orm Hilmarsson. Well, kind of; when I saw his name spin by in the credits, I was expecting a rather more experimental, dissonant soundtrack than I got.

If you've read Susanna Moore's novel, you'll know that ""experimental"" and ""dissonant"" are perfectly valid expectations in a soundtrack of its adaptation. The story concerns Frannie (Meg Ryan), a college English teacher who in her spare time is compiling a dictionary of street slang. While out with one of the students helping her in that regard one evening, she makes a wrong turn looking for the bathroom in a bar and witnesses an intimate act. The woman involved later turns up dead, and a detective named Malloy (You Can Count on Me's Mark Ruffalo) comes around investigating the murder. Frannie and Malloy find themselves drawn into a relationship neither seems to want, but both seem to need.

First off: Campion, who also wrote the screenplay, made the unforgivable mistake of changing the ending of the novel (but then, this is a Hollywood movie, I should have expected it), which changes the entire tone of the film in retrospect. The way the plot unfolds points to one inevitable conclusion, and we are cheated of it. Also, the characters-- who weren't exactly bottomless wells of characterization in the book-- have been stripped as far down to their prototypes as possible while still keeping them recognizable human beings. There's nothing here to grab onto, giving the whole thing the feel of Sex and the City with a serial killer on the loose. Important pieces that connect bits together have been tossed away, leading to scenes seeming disconnected from everything else (the title really does have a meaning, in the book anyway, though here it just gets blurted out with no frame of reference at all). And, really, who was it that first decided Mark Ruffalo can act?

I'm willing to concede that much of the reason I hated this movie as much as I did may have come from my committing the cardinal sin of seeing the movie within a year of reading the book on which it's based, but to be honest, I can't imagine I'd have liked it a whole lot more if I hadn't read the book.

She wasn't perky and spunky like she is in other movies but the way she plays down the role proves that somtimes less is more.

First, there is Meg Ryan.  Never again will I view her as a bubbly air-head blond, but now respect her as a very talented actress.  She is a teacher, tormented by many demons and living life her own way in a gritty part of the city.  She is lonely and stuck in a personal deadend, but her career as a writer and teacher keeps her going.  She is also very good as an erotic actor, so if you want to see her that way, this is your film.  Yet her whole demeanor is different in this film:  she is kind of dowdy, if attractive in an untraditional way.

Second, there is Leigh.  She is a troubled half-sister, kind of an exagerrated version of Ryan.  While I already saw her as a great actor, her performance in this is brilliantly succinct and dense, implying a very complex psychlogy in just a few brief moments.  Quite stunning.

There also ought to be a special Academy Award for movies whose cast and crew include very talented people who, between them, have amassed a string of hits, and yet are still second rate, at best.

Here's another potential category - - movies that are produced, directed by, and star members of underserved groups, African Americans or women, maybe, and yet still manage to present dismal depictions of African Americans or women.

Had there been such an Academy Awards, ""In the Cut"" may have taken all three awards in 2003.

""In the Cut"" wants to be a newer, bolder ""Klute,"" instead, it's an exercise in headscratching.

Why did Jane Campion, maker of woman-friendly ""The Piano,"" make a movie where the two female leads are, alternately, droopy, sleepy, drunken, stupid, self-sabotaging, and/or naked? Where the serial killer is more appealing than they are? The male characters here are lively, fascinating, and/or sexy, by turns. The women? They are so under realized, so . . . fungal - - as in fungal life forms, creatures that reveal little personality or motivation or locomotion or thought - - that, while you aren't actually rooting for the serial killer, you do wish you could jump up onscreen, smack these women hard across the face, get them into a cold shower, and inject them with some B 12.

And, aren't there already enough B-grade slasher movies out there where women in skimpy dresses and high heels make moves so stupid that the audience screams at the screen? Do we really need an artsy version?

This movie doesn't just punish its fictional characters; it also punishes the very fine actress, Meg Ryan. There are scenes whose whole point seems to be, ""Look! Meg Ryan has bags under her eyes!"" and other scenes that revolve around, ""Look! You get to see Meg Ryan's private parts!"" There are similar scenes with Jennifer Jason Leigh, but she's made a career out of this kind of thing, and I wouldn't want to object to her bread and butter.

If a male director had made this movie, women - - I - - would be braying.

There is something very much worth seeing here, though. It's Mark Ruffalo as a police officer cum sex fantasy cum suspected serial killer.

Ruffalo is so excellent here, sexy, earthy, smoldering, vulnerable, alternately, as the plot needs him to be, eminently believable as a dedicated New York City cop who learned how to make love to women early in life and has been collecting lessons ever since, or as a suspected Serial Killer who likes chopping up female bodies - - he's so one hundred per cent fine and memorable at all this that you really want to invent some new video technology that can extract him from the drek surrounding him and insert him into a much better movie.

Let's hope he finds his way to a much better movie, very soon, in which he gets to do everything he does here, and more - - serve a worthy plot.

Kevin Bacon, as an unhinged medical student and owner of a hairless dog, steals his few brief scenes from a nearly catatonic Meg Ryan. He's scary, loud, and fun. Sort of like a car wreck, you can't look away.

About mid-movie the family history is touched on and the connection made. Mark Ruffalo plays Detective Malloy and does so quite well adding a nice sense of realism to the role. Malloy is investigating a series of violent murders and the story is basically a psychological thiller and Director Jane Campion makes good use of this genre. It is a very dark movie not only visually but contextually and as with all movies this setting alone may not be for all people. Kevin Bacon is in the movie as a current-former lover of Frannies although checking the credits twice I'd not found him listed. His character adds significantly to the overall intertwining of the story. Based upon Susanna Moore's novel. A good movie for a rainy, dark evening! Similiar in its violence to films like Se7en.",1120780800,,1263,4.851851851851852
1964500,3,B0000ZMGWK,"After many years as a popular main stream actress, Meg Ryan, in this film, decided to show us what she's got and whats she's got ain't bad. It's almost but not quite worth the price of admission. Ryan, playing the quiet, somewhat apathetic English teacher, Franny, gets romantically involved with Detective Mallory, played by Mark Ruffalo, during a murder investigation.

Director Jane Campion does a comendable job of develing the hot and cold, sometimes steamy relationship between Ryan and Ruffalo but at the expense of the overall story line. Apparently she decided to exploit the erotic aspect of the story and concentrate on that rather than properly develop the suspenseful angle to it's full potential.

She does try to create more of a thriller feeling toward the end but it hasn't been properly set up and it falls short in that respect.",1117929600,2,847,4.957746478873239
1964501,3,B0000ZMGWK,"I know that Meg Ryan feared the typecasting system, and she's worried that if she was to make another ""crowd-pleaser"" romantic comedy, audiences would get sick of her being the American sweetheart again and again. So she really deserve the credit for having the courage to surprise her fans with this provokative and daring sexual thriller. She goes to the dark side so that she can broaden her range as a actress. Everyone who had seen Jane Campion's films such as The Piano(Holly Hunter) or Portrait of a Lady(Nicole Kidman), were eager to see how she managed to transform Ryan into a different kind of woman. Afterall, she's so good at creating brilliant female roles. Unfortunately, the result is rather mediocre, not that Meg Ryan didn't submit herself emotionally and physically(she had some nudity) to this film, but it's because the script is weak, and it's hard for a viewer like myself to feel any sympathy towards her character.

It's a kinky and mysterious experience for Ryan to endure in this film that covers murder, sex, manipulation(head game played by the twisted and highly sexualized cop/Mark Ruffalo). She's drawn to the mysterious and dangerous aspect of love and vulnerable to explore despite the dangerous consquences she might encounter. This film is dark in terms of the story and the lighting as well. It really doesn't have the artsy look of The Piano at all.

Jennifer Jason Leigh is inappropiately cast as Ryan's sister, and she had little to do with minimal screen time. Mark Ruffalo tried his very best with his corrupted character, but I can't see him in this kind of roles, especially when his You Can Count On Me performance is so heartbreaking and totally opposite of this film.

I know this film has been somewhat of a failure for both Campion and Ryan, because it bombed at the box office, and didn't have good reviews from critics and viewers, but it will always be the movie that had changed the way people see Meg Ryan.",1115769600,,1960,4.792899408284024

However, if you accept this unrealistic setting for the sake of the love story, the film unwinds beautifully. After the movie's rather slow start, I began to take an interest in Meg Ryans cool character and her obsession with the un-sophisticated Mark Ruffalo. Their attraction works perfectly and believably on the screen. This is what saved the movie for me, especially since they (as well as the rest of the cast) act so well.

I thought Meg Ryan has finally been given a vehicle to show her acting versatility, to show us the dark side.  That's what this genre is all about.  If you frown a little to your self when you think about it and, at the same time, can't get it out of your mind, then it has done it's job.

I don't think there is anything wrong with her pursuits and her performances are not THAT bad, but overall... why mess with a good thing? One word comes to mind with regard to this film: gratuitous.

It loses sight of the fact that there is really no basis in the story for the attraction between their two characters apart from Ryan's apparent frustration and Ruffalo's apparent directness.

It has absolutely no value whatsoever.  I had never heard of this movie, and I will be trying very hard to forget it.  And that is unfortunate, because this is one of the worse movies I've seen in a very long time.

  Basically, the story revolves around a woman named Frannie, who teach high school english.  Her character is very boring and very unappealing.  She has not even the slightest drop of personality.  You don't quite know whats on her mind, or what is her motivation for even existing.  Overall, she is a very forgetable character.

  About 30 minutes into the insomnia killing movie, we find a young detective by the name of Malloy.  He is investigating a murder, which adds a(very little) plot dimension to this movie.  Apparenly there is a man, with the same tatoo as Malloy, who killed a woman.  Of course, the plot is SO predictable.  But the bad plot is not the worse part of this movie.

  Apparently the movie is meant to emphasise the relationship with Malloy and Frannie.  This relationship is based off of nothhing, no logic, no real emotions, it is just some ad hoc relationship meant to appease a more shallow audience.  I am old enough to buy porno, so I don't care about seeing a naked Meg Ryan in an R-rated movie.  I buy movies for great character devlopements or a great plot.  This movie has neither.

  The problem is that Malloy is very unappealing.  This makes Stiffler from American Pie, look like a feminist sypathizer.  Yes, this guy is foul mouthed, obnoxious, and plain stupid.  I am almost amazed that alot of women reviewers find this guy appealing.  Did I miss something here?  I thought this was the type of guys women didn't like.  Well trying to make sense of women is alot like trying to find something good about this movie.  It will probably never happen.

1964513,2,B0000ZMGWK,"I remember back when ""Piano"" came out and everyone was talking about this exciting new film-maker, Jane Campion, who was clearly destined for great things.

Well, those great things never happened. ""Holy Smoke"" was as awful as its title, and now we have ""In the Cut,"" a second-rate hacker-slasher murder mystery with a pseudo-psychological edge and Meg Ryan breaking with tradition by playing a really depressed, lonely, sex-starved middle-aged woman who spends most of the movie looking like total hell.

On the one hand, I admire Meg Ryan for taking such a risk with her career. And, in fact, she does as good a job as one could hope for, given the film she's stuck in. The problem is that this relentlessly gloomy, oppressive, miserable movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities. There are no moments of hope or love or humor or even the possibility of joy for any of the characters. Everyone is screwed up, and most of them viciously so.

So, as we run through the characters, trying to guess who the killer is, it quickly becomes apparent that it really could be any of them and, more importantly, that it doesn't actually matter who the killer is, because we have nothing invested in any of these characters.

Gloomy and depressing, ""In the Cut"" has no insights to offer, aside from the fact that men and women oftentimes don't get along very well and that there's a lot of misery in this world.

1964515,3,B0000ZMGWK,"***1/2 Meg Ryan gives what may well be the breakthrough performance of her career in ""In the Cut,"" a violent, erotic thriller from maverick filmmaker Jane Campion.  Ryan plays Frannie, a college English instructor who is instinctively drawn to the seamier side of life.  When women in her Manhattan neighborhood start falling victim to a grizzly serial killer, Frannie, as a possible witness, becomes a prime source of interest, both professionally and personally, for a homicide detective named Malloy, who has some troubling sexual proclivities of his own to deal with.  Attracted by his edgy darkness and smoldering sexuality, Frannie succumbs to his advances, fully cognizant of the possible danger he represents.  Is the law enforcement official as much of a threat to this young woman as the psychopath going about town decapitating and dismembering the local ladies?  It is this kind of moral ambiguity that informs the entire movie.

From the very outset, Campion makes it clear that we are not in for a conventional police procedural.  She is obviously more interested in character and mood than in the niceties of a well-oiled plot and streamlined exposition.  Frannie is far from being the helpless victim or plucky heroine one usually finds at the center of such tales;  she is a complex, moody, taciturn woman who seems to be drifting passively through life, with little passion, conviction or purpose to make any of it worthwhile.  Even when it comes to her sexual obsessions, it often feels as if she is just going through the motions.  It is hard for us to get a bead on her, for she is a perfect reflection of the world she inhabits, a world without a clear moral compass - so much so that we often don't know what we are supposed to think of her or the other people with whom she comes in contact.  The script plays up the sense of dislocation by having characters appear and disappear seemingly at random throughout the movie, sometimes serving as little more than red herrings for both the story and Frannie's life.  This often makes it so that we in the audience feel clueless as to where exactly the film is headed and what the overall purpose of it really is.  It's often hard for us to get our bearings, yet, it is this very ambiguity, this sense of being rudderless and confused, that lifts the film above the tired conventions of the genre.  In fact, the film is at its weakest when it concentrates on the intricacies of the plot - the resolution is remarkably mundane - and at its strongest when it merely records the eccentricities and passions of its two enigmatic characters.

The sexual content of the film is highly charged but not overtly offensive, with one glaring exception, at least in the ""unrated"" version (I assume this does not apply to the version released to theaters).  Early in the film, we are treated to a graphic, hard core close-up of an act of fellatio that clearly is not simulated.  Consider yourself forewarned.

Ryan has never been better than she is here.  She plays Frannie almost as if she were one of the urban walking dead, just right for a modern woman who feels no real emotional connection with the world and the people around her.  Mark Ruffalo is excellent as the cop who may be more of a threat to Frannie than the killer who's terrorizing the area.  Almost as an afterthought, Kevin Bacon makes little more than a cameo appearance, overacting in the role of Frannie's stalker ex-boyfriend.

""In the Cut"" is a subtle little mood piece that is more about observing behavior than it is about searching for a killer.  Those looking for an intensely plotted thriller may not be as intrigued by this film as those searching for a psychosexual character study.

It's a feminist take on a serial killer movie, which seems to argue that the way women's sexuality is seen/treated by our culture causes a segmentation of the body from the mind -- a psychic vivisection that is, in this piece, echoed by what the serial killer does to his victims.

Sadly amazon.com reviews cannot contain spoilers. I would really like to write about what I think is unsaid, underplot of this film, since so many people seem to be missing.

Now in 2013 I see that there is no ban on spoilers in the Amazon review guidelines, so here below is my review CONTAINING SPOILERS.

""In the Cut"" was co-produced by Nicole, very intelligent woman,  Kidman, who worked on the film for five years using her own money, and meant to star herself. Due to her divorce it ended up starring then still A-List Meg Ryan (who had recently divorced also), who appeared naked for the first time on film. Despite being backed by two highly intelligent mega-stars, it flopped. I think that it may have been a bit too clever for the audience.

Not only due to the choice of lead actress, In the Cut has a confusing genre bending feel to it. On the one hand it was an almost schmaltzy romantic comedy with a happy end, and on the other it was a murder suspense mixing it with many of the films already mentioned in this thread.

The most striking thing for me, is the way in which it features an unreliable narrator. The film is seen from Meg Ryan's character's point of view, but her point of view is cranky and called into question. Ryan's character is surrounded by murders, clues relating her to the murder are found in her yard, her sister is murdered, and the whole film has crazy parallels with the book that Meg Ryan's character is teaching (by a subsequently suicidal authoress) ""To the Lighthouse.""

So if the preceding paragraph hasn't spoilt the movie already for you by now, putting it plainly, I think that real murderer is in fact Meg Ryan's character (look at her eyes in the poster above, look at the catch copy). The ending we are shown is too schmaltzy to be true, and it isn't. The final scene is the fiction that Ryan's character foists on herself, and -- after killing everyone and anyone that is close to him --- her captive lover.

The truth of the movie was, as the otherwise inappropriate title suggests, ""In the Cut."" If so then it is in the vast minority of  movies. Movies almost always give the game away. [As far as I know, only Mulholland Dr, doesn't, and some say that it does.] In the Cut  may go further and actually finally obscure the truth, and the identity of the  murderer. If so it was a really revolutionary film, but perhaps a bit  too much so.

Perhaps In the Cut can be seen on more than one level - as happy end fun-flick - and as something much more personal, much deeper.",1097452800,2,2901,4.299082568807339

Meg Ryan has stepped to an all time low by starring in this movie based on nothing. Her character teaches literature but only shows her teaching in one scene for a brief moment. Other than poetry the only other thing on Ryan's mind is sex. Sadly cute little Meg Ryan just doesn't cut it as a sexual predator who falls in bed at the drop of a hat with homicide detective Mark Ruffalo. Her character is just not fathomable or believable and what did she do to her pretty little face? Ruffalo comes across as just a perverted pig cop looking for a thrill and not smart enough to figure out a crime that exists right under his nose. Maybe it's more than alcohol that rots ones brain! Appearances by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kevin Bacon don't add any depth or understanding to this picture either. As for the sex scenes.....so what! I guess if you like mousy brown colored women who sneer a lot you might get a thrill but Meg Ryan just did herself a complete injustice in my opinion.

Director Jane Campion filmed this movie without a drop of any color; every scene is filled with a smog colored hue that almost makes you sick after a few hours. I am not sure what Campion was trying to accomplish with this project, her characters were horribly mis-cast, her script haphazard and lacking in substance and her camera angles only emphasized the worst in her actors. Someone should have been shot for making this movie but I am not sure who to blame more the actors, the director or the scriptwriter.

The movie was fantastic, Meg Ryan is anything but one dimensional in this film! she showed a depth as an actress that I think we rarely see.  Mark made his character Giovanni, increadibly erotic and sexy - and I was hooked watching to see how this unusual (yet far more realistic than most hollywood love affairs) love affair would progress.  The thriller side of it I found also very enjoyable, I loved the way that the tension is built.  All the characters were either suspects or potential victims, although I knew from the begginning it couldn't be the student, I oscillated around suspecting all the characters at some point.  Jane Campion is a fantastic director, and has handled her debut into film noir with grace and sophistication.  Even the much talked about fellatio scene was well lit and very artistic.

I mean, I'm sex starved at the moment but I'm not always talking about sex. Not to mention, how could a guy like Ruffalo's character possibly woo the English teacher. I mean hopefully her knowledge goes beyond text book smarts and would include a little conventional wisdom, or at least some common sense. This guy was a complete @ss, I don't see why any girl with one eye and half a brain would even consider being in the same room with this guy.

The only reason I'm giving this piece of bad film making 2 stars is because of Meg Ryan. Her acting here is sub par, definitely not her best, and she doesn't look her best here either, but she's still hot enough to keep me watching. If you're looking for a good story, don't get this. If you want a soft core porn and you want to see Meg Ryan in the buff, I would probably still suggest American Beauty because Mena Suvari is hotter, and the movie is ten times better.",1095984000,4,1143,4.219178082191781
1964526,2,B0000ZMGWK,"This film is obsessed with sex, much like it's protagonist.  The problem with this is that the director doesn't successfully dilineate between the story and the subjectivity of the main character and she ends up taking over the film.  Because of this the other plot elements about her sister, memory of her mother's story, and serial killer sideplot are given the rightful respect they deserve.  You could call this a character piece instead of a thriller, but it doesn't quite reach that level, either.  Each character is given good introductions and we get an essence of who they are, but we don't know them,which is what character studies do.  I understand that the director probably wanted to bring a kind of personal tone to the formulaic sex thriller, but making a very subdued woman as the head of it is a bad mistake.  It was based on a book, however, not all books were made to be transfered to film.  I believe this was a mistake on the part of the director, but a stylish one.  Unfortunately, the overall effect of the film is numbing without impact, and without any thought-provoking content relating to the story.",1095811200,,1126,4.709183673469388
1964527,3,B0000ZMGWK,"Having read Susanna Moore's novel back in 1996, viewing this film was an exercise in curiosity more than anything else. The novel itself is powerful and intense, exploring the dark, irrational sexual aspects of our natures. Moore's novel is indeed atmospheric, building erotic intensity until the last page, revealing the vulnerability of women in general, who exist in a predominately male world. Male vulgarity and aggression is depicted quite well in the novel and the film as Moore co-wrote the screenplay. As far as film adaptations go, this film hardly strayed from the novel, and managed to capture its many themes.

As has been mentioned many times, this role is a far cry from Meg Ryan's usual fare. Her performance as the brooding, intelligent, sexually inhibited literature teacher living alone in New York City was indeed believable. The highly charged scene in the bar, where she witnesses a sexual act that later connects to a gruesome murder, is gratuitous. In writing and in film, my philosophy has always been `less is more', as this scene could have been done without the graphic detail. However I do understand that this particular scene was intended to set the mood and basic themes of the story. The book was intended to be shocking thus Campion needed to put it in our face to ensure this happened. In my case, a subtle nod would have been enough as opposed to stinging slap across the ears.

After reading the novel and viewing the film, one is not too proud to be the male of the species. We're depicted as beer swilling, foul mouthed, manner- less and aggressive. And a woman exploring her erotic nature, her sexual desires, is at dire risk in a world full of Neanderthals. To a certain extent this is perhaps true.  But there is no subtlety in this film and I suppose Campion thought it necessary to beat us over the head.

If you enjoy erotic thrillers with gratuitous sex and violence that depicts the dangers of women living amongst vulgar aggressive men, by all means see this picture. If you prefer something more subtle and less in your face, move to the next shelf.",1094860800,3,2098,4.7554945054945055

 This film would be lurid and haunting if David Lynch had made it, but Jane Campion should have done what she does best, and paid more attention to the dynamics of the women characters, something she's proved adept at in Sweetie, The Piano, and her other works.

 The word ""lurid"" continually comes to mind in trying to describe this film, but it really never gets there. It is slow and somewhat confused in some places, without the dream-like quality that would have justified these adjectives.

 It is still worth watching. Mediocre Jane Campion is still better than most of what comes from Hollywood.

 Meg Ryan is worth seeing. She is stretching out here, and succeeds most of the time. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who should have more screen time, is magnificent. She can communicate a complex character in just a few gestures; as Ryan's sister she is appealing and heart-breaking even while playing a character who doesn't make grand entrances or turn heads.

I think it would have been horrible if it was completely true to the book. The additions are what make this film. The poetry in the subway. The garden outside her window. Meg Ryan playing against type. Mark Ruffalo is wonderful in his role, not giving the end away. And I loved the ending. I felt unresolved at the end of the book, and this ending made me happy.

Browsing through earlier reviews I noticed people either seemed to love this movie, or hate it with very little moderation on either side of those extremes. I didn't LOOOOOOOOOOVE it i.e feel it was a cinematic masterpiece. However I did really enjoy it and felt some reviews were a little harsh, personally I have nothing but respect and admiration for Meg Ryan for portraying a character so far from her usual cutesy funny mould. She as usual did an excellent acting job as did Leigh and Ruffalo. Meg just gets more judos due to the risk she took. If it helps her hinders her career may be open to debate but I for one would like to see her in more edgier roles as she proved with aplonb she can handle them.

1964538,4,B0000ZMGWK,"The key to understanding and enjoying this film is understanding its Academic Feminist underpinnings.  Basically: that we live in a deeply phallocentric and patriarchal society in which men are free to be wolves and women are ultimately, inescapably condemned to be two-legged lambs who like to imagine that they are free, liberated and ""equal""---and while resistance might be heroic and psychologically necessary, it is hopelessly futile.
Bah humbug, you might say---however, both the film and the movie are very effective at getting that perspective across.  This is the kind of stuff that makes me think to myself, if I were a woman I'd definitely want to be a lesbian.
At least that's how the book reads; about 90% of the film is like that too, except for the last 5 minutes when Campion (and/or her producers) tinkers with it to create a somewhat happier ending.
I liked the book better for its refusal to compromise, but it was a dull read.

Between the explicit love scenes (and in the unrated director's cut there are aplenty) and the gruesome crime scenes, one is left to wonder what else this film can breakthrough with; but such things as character development and actual suspense aren't to be found.  Fans of the book will notice how closely the film follows it's source material's events up until the final quarter of the film, and all together In the Cut is worthwhile entertainment, up until it is rendered utterly pointless.

The brilliance of director Jane Campion in taking the cast, including Meg Ryan, Mark Ruffalo and Jenifer Jason Leigh out of their respective comfort zones is really well done.
Much has been said about the felatio scene, but this scene is pivotal to the whole film, in the sense that it gives the viewer the important clue that forshadows the puzzle to come. So please get the uncut version on DVD if you can.
From the opening scene, we see Jennifer Jason Leigh standing in her own little garden appearing lost and confused, together with the ambient music of China Forbes (of Pink Martini) singing Que Sera Sera. This is what sets the tone for the movie. This film really is about a series of mistaken identities of perception.

Now, coming from a guy that owns over 500 titles, let me say that the above mentioned motivators fell depressingly short of my minimal expectations. The movie had the potential for intrigue, but didn't pursue it. Jennifer Jason Leigh didn't really need to be in the movie at all. There was a student that Meg meets with periodically to do research for a book on urban slang(?) who made absolutley no contribution to the plot. Mark Ruffalo strikes me as a grungy low-life. Don't see anything that resembles handsomeness in him. Speaking of which, his tattoo, let's talk about his tattoo. In the beginning, it is shown in the movie as an identifying mark that Meg keys on periodically. However, its relevance is never explained other than, ""It's an exclusive club that I belong to"", or some silly Bu#& S-@*%! Kevin Bacon has no reason to be in this movie. His character as a neurotic obsessive ex-boyfriend of Meg's, never goes anywhere. To date Kevin Bacon has been in 52 movies, and this part seemed like an excuse to give him his 53rd title, ya know? Very odd. There's an appropriate phase to sum up this movie - ""Very Odd"". It is my sincerest hope that the book was much more enjoyable than the movie (although I didn't read it - and won't if the movie is any indicator). Maybe the book just doesn't translate to film - sort of like Stephen King. Don't know, still shaking my head over this one.

1964545,3,B0000ZMGWK,"A film by Jane Campion
I had fairly low expectations going into ""In the Cut"" that I couldn't help but enjoy the movie more than I thought I would.  The critical reaction to the movie has been negative, and though I see the point of the critics, I only partially agree.  The problem, as I see it, is that the buzz on this movie is that ""In the Cut"" started being seen as ""the movie where Meg Ryan gets naked"" rather than anything about the actual story.  There is a bit more to ""In the Cut"" than that buzz.
The story is that Detective Malloy (Mark Ruffalo) is investigating a brutal murder and evidence was left outside the apartment building where Frannie (Meg Ryan) lives.  Malloy questions Frannie, and they end up in a relationship based almost entirely on the physical.  The focus of the film stays on the relationship at the expense of the murder plotline.  How this mixes together is that Frannie starts to suspect that possibly Malloy is the killer.  Yet, Frannie stays in this intensely sexual relationship even with her doubts.
The trouble that I had with this movie was that I wasn't sure that director Jane Campion ever decided on whether this is an erotic love story or a murder mystery, and the film suffers a bit because of that.  At no time did I feel that there was nudity for the sake of nudity, but if it was also meant to be sensual and erotic, it wasn't.  The sex and the nudity in the movie were just there.  It was nice to see Meg Ryan in a dramatic role, as she is a very capable actress (""When a Man Loves a Woman"", ""Courage Under Fire""), but I am left with mixed feelings on ""In the Cut"".  I didn't feel much chemistry between Ryan and Ruffalo.  Oddly enough, the best chemistry (and sexual tension) comes between Frannie and her sister, Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  To use Roger Ebert's rating system, my thumb is wavering between up and down, and that would tell me to go with thumbs down if I can't honestly recommend ""In the Cut"".",1084147200,,1963,4.404432132963989

The detective she falls for is such an obnoxious lout that I lose sympathy for her character for just hooking up with him.

I hope this doesn't discourage her from taking roles like this.  She's great.

1964554,1,B0000ZMGWK,"I was expecting great things from this movie.  I'd been anticipating it's arrival in theaters for months.  The previews looked good, the description sounded very interesting, and I'm a Meg Ryan fan.
Unfortunately, the movie stinks.  I kept thinking ""maybe it will get better"", so I kept watching.  It didn't get better.  It was SLOW, the characters were completely empty (Meg's character had no expression on her face throughout the movie...maybe her character was supposed to be on extremely high levels of anti-anxiety medicine..??), and then there were the completely odd subway scenes where she'd be fascinated by strangely worded ""advertisements"".  Maybe I just don't understand independent films, but those scenes just struck me as ignorant and out of place.
Jennifer Jason Leigh has never come across as a good actress (at least in my opinion) and this movie proved just that.  Her character spent most of her time bawling her eyes out and complaining she couldn't get enough sex or a husband (hmm...I wonder why).  ""Pauline"" was annoying, at best.
Meg Ryan can do MUCH better than this.  She's always plays sweet and cute characters, but this movie basically turned her into an unemotional, foul-mouthed sleeze.  The movie just looked like a pretty lame excuse to get naked on the big screen.
The ending was unpredictable (notice I didn't say ""good""), but it didn't make up for the rest of the movie.
I was highly disappointed.  Seems like a lot of other people were, too.  Don't waste your time.",1081296000,5,1504,4.972
1964555,1,B0000ZMGWK,"Meg Ryan, it is said, showed another side of her acting ability in ""In The Cut.""  Like its suggestive title, the film is not actually about murder mystery, but an exploration of sexuality of women.  All right, but director Jane Campion should have known that Meg Ryan has already done it, in much better form, in ""When Harry Met Sally..."" 14 years ago.
I am talking about the fake orgasm scene at NYC diner.  That was natural, lovely, and convincing.  ""In The Cut"" is none of them, pretentious and preposterous.  The story is not important, but it goes like this.  Meg Ryan is teaching English literature (this week, Virginia Wolfe) at college, and collecting slang for her research.  A murder happens near her room, and a detecive Mark Rafallo knocks on the door.
The detective comes back again and again while investigating the case, trying to seduce her.  She refuses, then succumbs to his charm while another murder happens.  And another.  Jeniffer Jason Leigh and uncredited Kevin Bacon also appear.
This is not a thriller in a traditional sense.  Campion borrows the film noir form for her own exloration of sexuality, and that is not a bad idea.  There is no thrill at all; the ending is telegraphed from miles away; but that is not a problem.
The preblem is, Jane Campion does not understand men and women at all.  Her characters are unnatural, and as lifeless as marble statues.  No woman in the 21th century would pander to the sexual desire of a stranger as the film shows.  No woman would mumble her past (like, ""When I was a child..."") when after the terrible event happened as the film shows.
And nudity does not mean sexuality, or even sex.  It is known that Meg Ryan took off her shirt for the film, but keep this in mind.  The sex scenes are passionless because the camera (Dion Beebe, of ""Chicago"") is emotionally cold, being often out of forcus.  I don't see the point of shooting like that, and if there is any, I just missed it.  Maybe Jane Campion is far more intelligent than us.
Some may disagree, but I think Jane Campion severely damaged the career of Kate Winslet with ""Holy Smoke.""  Now the same thing is happening to Meg Ryan, who seems dissatisfied with the genre of romatic comedy.  My sincere advice to her; the problem is not romantic comedy itself, it's bad romantic comedy.

1964559,4,B0000ZMGWK,"""In The Cut"" is an adaptation of Susanna Moore's excellent novel of the same title, published in 1995. Director Jane Campion has departed significantly from the novel in several places, especially with the ending, but has managed to capture much of the book's eroticism, dark edginess, and palpable suspense.
Frannie Avery, superbly acted by Meg Ryan, is an attractive 35 year-old divorcee who lives in a two room apartment on Washington Square. She teaches creative writing at NYU to a group of inner-city teens. She is also a connoisseur and scholar of language and is writing a book on street slang and its derivatives. Frannie takes chances. She is a sexual risk taker. However, she lives in her own private world where she spends an incredible amount of time pondering the nature of language, which leaves her vulnerable to her surroundings...and reality. Frannie is not at all street savvy. And her nearsightedness allows her to disengage even more from the potentially dangerous world in which she lives. One late afternoon, in a neighborhood bar, she makes a trip to the ladies room and inadvertently walks-in on a couple engaged in an intimate act. The man's face is obscured by shadow but she does notice that he has a unique tattoo on the inside of his wrist. A few days later a NYC homicide detective, James E. Malloy (Mark Ruffalo), seeks Frannie out for an interview. There has been a brutal murder in the neighborhood. The victim is the woman Frannie saw performing the sex act in the bar. The evening Frannie saw her was her last.

Malloy takes risks also. He totally defies all rules about relationships between a detective and potential witness and acts on the tremendous sexual attraction between Frannie and himself. Malloy epitomizes the ""tough guy with a badge,"" his frank blunt language adding to Frannie's turn-on. From the first, however, she knew that Malloy had a tattoo on his wrist - a tattoo she had seen once before.
Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Pauline, Frannie's spacey, obsessive half-sister and the person Frannie is closest to and loves. She lives above a topless bar in downtown Manhattan and the affection both women feel for the erotic dancers, the entire ambiance of the club and its proximity to their lives, reestablishes the sense of careless oblivion to danger. Together the two ponder the ups and downs of being female, discuss sexuality and romance and their father's many foibles.
Kevin Bacon is Frannie's off-the-wall ex-boyfriend who stalks her and maintains a threatening presence throughout. And Sharrieff Pugh is excellent as one of Frannie's brightest students who is fixated upon John Wayne Gacy.
Jane Campion, an extraordinary director, has not given us a typical mystery thriller about a vicious serial killer. ""In The Cut"" is more an exploration of the sexuality and inner life of an intelligent, creative, emotionally starved women approaching middle age. Detective Mallory's aggressive masculinity and the threat of the physical danger which surrounds her jar Frannie awake. The films portrays an urban environment of muted violence just waiting to explode and the colors and sounds of Campion's New York add to the building tension. There are some superbly staged sequences which give a hallucinatory, almost nightmarish quality to the scenes. The intense and honest performances really compensate for the movie's flaws. I found myself totally absorbed. Recommended - but be warned, this is not a movie for the sqeamish or faint of heart!

1964561,5,B0000ZMGWK,"Two thumbs up for Meg Ryan! Having seen her for so long as the typically nice, witty, and pretty girl in romantic comedies such as ""When Harry Met Sally"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""You've Got Mail"", and ""The French Kiss"", I would say that she really cut it in ""In The Cut"", a psycho-thriller based on Susanna Moore book. That's the sole reason why I give a five-star rating.
However, the storyline is not that special. I aggree with one of
the previous reviewers that the movie is more psychological than typical thriller. The grim and bleak atmosphere reminds me more of ""The People I Know"" (starring Al Pacino), which is, by the way, not a thriller, than ""Seven"" (Brad Pitt), which is one of the best thrillers I've ever seen on the screen.
Mark Rufallo, as the no-nonsense NYPD Detective Malloy was well cast to boost the never-before-seen-side of Ryan's screen personality. The erotic scenes between Ryan and Rufallo are great. Really first rate. In my opinion, it could only be achieved by a female director. And those scenes are really worthy of Jane Campion. (Even now I can still recall the erotic sparks between Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel in ""The Piano""). Under Campion direction in this film, Ryan appears as a totally new personality, even better than her characterizations in ""Courage Under Fire"" and ""Proof of Life"".(*)",1080518400,2,1335,4.834061135371179
1964562,3,B0000ZMGWK,"Simply put, if any man tells you that they either, went to the theater, purchased or rented this film because they thought that it would be a great thriller of a murder/mystery type movie is telling a tale of their own.  I, like most others, simply wanted to watch this movie as for the first time ever; Meg Ryan who is one of Americas Hollywood sweethearts of so many great films was finally going to do a nude scene, plain and simple.  That being said, yes there are some fairly ""interesting"" scenes with Meg in this film but as a whole, the story is horribly predictable and the nude scenes are exhibitionist at best and really do nothing to further the film other than show that her character is an isolated, lonely woman that becomes attracted to a cop.
Performance wise, Meg Ryan in this film is so totally different than any other character she's ever played before, which in part may be why she wanted to do the part.  Overall, the part and the film do more to detract from her body of work than to actually enhance it, no pun intended!  Mark Ruffalo's performance is a very good one when considering any previous minor roles he might've been noticed in on other films.  Jennifer Jason Leigh's minor part in the film doesn't really give her an opportunity to shine as she's quite capable of.
""In the Cut"" is the first film that I've watched that Jane Campion has directed and unfortunately this film doesn't leave an overwhelmingly satisfying impression of her work for me.  Whether it's the script or the directing, this film is almost entirely flat, one dimensional and is clearly relying on the fact that it's the first time Meg Ryan does nudity to make any money whatsoever!
The Premise:
Meg Ryan plays Frannie Averey, a lonely high school teacher living in New York City who is also trying to write a book on slang words.  Very early in the film she's in a bar with one of her students who is teaching her some of those slang words and when she excuses herself to go to the restroom, she's afforded the opportunity to spy on a couple doing what couples do and she notices a tattoo on the mans arm.  Later that week, Detective Giovanni Malloy shows up at her door wanting to know if she'd noticed anything strange as there is a serial killer loose and that killer left one of his victim's body parts in her garden, she notices that he has the very same tattoo and believes he was the one in the bar...
What follows from there is a fairly tedious film that relies much too much on sex scenes to carry the story and not on good screenwriting and scripting!  I would only recommend this film to fans of Meg Ryan's who just ""have"" to see it for what it is, but to those interested in seeing a well made thriller, looking elsewhere may be the best option!  {ssintrepid}

The camera focuses in and because....actually, there is no good artsy fartsy reason for this distracting device.  The only thing worthy about this DVD is the extra feature of a series of interviews with Ryan, Campion and Ruffalo.  Campion says she spent two years reading up on detective myserty and pornography.  It looks like she spent one day on the mystery part and the rest on the porn.  For some reason Kevin Bacon is not listed on the credits - his character provides a whole lot of uneaseiness to the Ryan role which fits the film but again, his character is not one you end up caring about.

Boy was I surprised..
The story revolves around Meg Ryan who is a school teacher in a crappy part of some city (probably New York).  She is stopped by a police officer one day because there was a homicide in her neighborhood.  What goes from there is a typical serial killer flick with a number of sexual situations.
Surprisingly though the sexual situations are far and few between.  There are moments but that is the max of it.  When it came down to it the movie actually featured less than expected (however this is the rated I watched).  In fact the only scene I could see in which this title could be pushed to un-rated (NC-17) was a sex scene in about halfway through (that was fairly explicit).  Some call this soft core porn, I just call it a typical erotic thriller.",1080259200,2,1044,4.350515463917525
1964566,4,B0000ZMGWK,"A few years ago I read the book upon which this 2003 film is based.  I hated the book and never thought I'd ever want to see the movie. However, I saw the DVD last night and changed my mind, not only because it's really a good story, is set in a neighborhood I can relate to, the characters seem real and the erotic scenes are really hot.  All these elements were in the book and I still hated it.  But the film is different because the story is tighter and -  mostly, because the ending has been changed.

Meg Ryan stars in a unique and challenging part.  She plays the role of a English teacher with unfulfilled romantic desires.  Her half-sister, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh is more outgoing, but just as needy as has her sister.  And some of the best scenes in the film are between the two women and the way they talk about men.  Mark Ruffalo is cast as a homicide detective.  He's rough and tough and very crude.  There's been a murder and he's doing the investigation.  Soon, he and Meg Ryan are having a fling.  His role was a difficult one because its always unclear if he's telling the truth or lying and there is a possibility that he is the murderer.  He's a good actor and does the best he can in the role.  My only problem with his performance, however, is that his New York accent didn't seem authentic.

The film is fast paced and scary and the couplings between Ryan and Ruffalo were outstanding.  And even though it seemed unlikely that in real life the characters would act in the way they did, during the time of the film, I found it believable enough to keep me intrigued.  This was not what I would call a truly great film, and it certainly isn't for everyone.  But I liked it and do recommend it.",1080172800,,1721,4.272445820433436

It's always puzzled me that Campion cannot.
This is another mess. One that like certain European films (Catherine Breillat's ""Romance"") tries to sell entirely on the basis of raunchy sex but actually claims to have more going for it.
It's an awful ugly grainy looking mess, and although I fervently believe Ryan is a much more tough lady than she ever admits to being on screen, I didn't buy the too self-conscious image change.

I can't comment on the film's middle section  since I dozed off for a bit -- when I asked my friend what had happened, she said ""Nothing!"" -- but from what I did see, I would call IN THE CUT tedious and disjointed.

First of all, the plot is nothing special and its details are unreal. (Jennifer Jason Leigh, as a low rent stripper in Manhattan, keeps her key in a flowerpot outside her front door. New Yorkers do that all the time, especially in rough neighborhoods.) Meg Ryan is all wrong for the supposedly sexy lead role, and I'm sorry, but Botox or something seems to have immobilized her face. She has very little expression here, and she's adrift temperamentally as well. Ryan doesn't come across as hip and reckless whenever she drops her clothes to embrace some new man, but like a frozen librarian hesitantly embarking on her first one night stand. Consequently, the star's onscreen chemistry with Mark Ruffalo is nonexistent and this further flattens out what's already a slow pace.

Aside from the key-in-the-flowerpot business, the story is dotted with other ridiculous plot points. (SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT) For instance, the heroine glimpses a mystery man across a shadowy room in an early scene: why is it that she can make out a tiny tattoo on his wrist, but not his face? And when the killer brings Ryan to a lighthouse at the climax, why does she meekly follow him inside? All of this is just unreal.

Nicole Kidman was excited about doing this film for years and it's hard to understand why. Perhaps one has to read the book. (Doing so might explain the title, for starters.) While I'll always have a special place in my movie-going heart for sordid thrillers, IN THE CUT is too stiff to be either truly dirty or thrilling.

1964574,2,B0000ZMGWK,"Meg Ryan took a big gamble by taking a role that casts her against type in a dark film that uses her in a number of semi-porn scenes.  She lost the gamble, but it wasn't her fault.  The blame rests squarely with Jane Campion, who directs this movie with no clear vision of where it should go, how it should affect the audience, or even what it's about.  It contains a rudimentary serial-killer plot line wrapped in a moth-easten blanket of psychosexual sleaze. The camera work is annoying and self-concious, adding tedium to a movie that's already a chore to watch.
Many reviewers here have applauded Mark Ruffalo, the male lead.  I can't understand why.  He seems like a second-string actor, with an uncharismatic screen presence.  Meg Ryan looks beautiful, and she really is quite sexy, but her beauty and sex appeal are defiled here, not because her body is exposed, but because it's exposed in a hopeless attempt to legitimize a crummy movie.  All this film will accomplish is to alienate Meg's fans.
When we finally find out who the killer is, it's a let down, just like everything else in this film.  I think Jane Campion has a facination with the mutilation of women (remember the piano?)and she uses it in spades here.  The one scene with Meg clutching that object (which I won't identify here)wrapped in a shower curtain should win the stupidly tasteless award for the year.

See what I mean? I couldn't tell you one tiny bit about what I remember of the storyline, aside from dismembered bodies, and nudity aplenty. This movie is pivotal in reinforcing the beliefs of many....
""Yes,Virginia..."" the world IS going to hell in a hand basket. This piece of crap is going on Ebay.
It's a sad day. Now that I have seen our quirky but adorable Meg Ryan in a different as well as disturbing role, it's hard to go back to the heart-warming days of ""shop-girl"". If changing public opinion of her was indeed her goal, I think she may have been successful, unfortunately. If you loved Meg's roles in the romantic comedy genre, a'la I Love Lucy sweetness, and you don't want that image marred, DO NOT watch this movie. You'll be sorry you did.

how did she see the tatoo on the cop's hand in that dark basement , of this filthy bar ?? For me Meg lost it all.

The movie is about Francis Avery (Meg Ryan) a loneley school teacher who meets a homicide detective named Giovanni Malloy when he is investigating a murder that happened at her apartment complex.
She is attracted to him at first sight and the two begin a love affair before she discovers he could be dangerous. But things heat up when she is mugged and she is forced to shack up with her sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh).Now like I said it was entertaining but it dragged in the beginning and it had a terrible ending. It also had some much un-needed characters like Frannies student Cornelius who has a strange obsession with executed serial killer John Wayne Gacy. Also,this movie isn't a movie prissy parents wanna let their kids watch due to a very graphic sex scene between Francis and Malloy. But if you want to let your kids watch it,go ahead.

I will, however, give praise where praise is due. Most films taken from novels fail to translate the novel's language and resort to turning the film into mush. This film isn't one of them. Director Jane Campion captures the darkness and starkness of a New York that is seldom illustrated in films. The cinematography is excellent. And the acting is superb. I loved Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Detective Malloy. He really brought the character to life. But the biggest surprise in the film is Meg Ryan. She's branched out of her America's Sweetheart image with a bang. She's proven that, above all else, she is an actress, and a versatile one at that. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kevin Bacon also do a great job. The ending was disappointing though.  The book's ending was far more gripping and disturbing. Then again, the film cannot be identical to the novel. All in all, Hollywood managed to capture this dark erotic thriller without sugarcoating the events.

The only person I really feel sorry for is Kevin Bacon. The guy is woefully underused as Meg Ryan's ""intense"" ex boyfriend. He gives the film a brief glimmer of hope but is then gone for almost the rest of the entire film.

The movie definately progresses at a slow pace, but that is part of the dreamy, slightly surreal quality that I enjoyed. What I loved the most was the visual aspect. This is a GORGEOUS movie to look at. The colors, the set design, the way her apartment looks, the way the city is shot, even the camera movements and the lenswork is wonderful, contributing to a strangely dark, fairy-tale like feel. (the best is the opening scene, with a the haunting, slightly discordant music, and the leaves falling through the garden outside her window, and the camera focusing hazily, as one would coming out of sleep.) The constant presence of the color red in every scene was a great touch, as were the words and quotes throughout. It was a sensual, evocative movie, a lovely little piece of texture and color and sound.
The sexual elements are explicit, and the violence, while never really on-screen, is alluded to in all its terribleness. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, and I understand, but for me that's what this movie was about. An exploration of those dark spaces in people's minds, and that sometimes there is something truly beautiful within, or between those spaces.",1077753600,,1412,4.674698795180723

They take such labored pains in creating false murder suspects that it comes across forced and faked.  The ""mystery"" is not set up by good storytelling, but by contrived brute force machinations.  I found the Mark Ruffalo character so extremely unlikable that I had a hard time believing Meg Ryan's character would even give him the time of day.  Also, was ANY explaination EVER give for the killer's motives, or had I just ceased caring by the time the aweful ending rolled around?  It seems like the screenplay was written by a college student who was probably thinking they were being very cleaver with all of this hoghwash.

1964595,2,B0000ZMGWK,"It takes a lot to shock me, but I was shocked by this film and disappointed that Meg Ryan's career has come to this.  Sure, she was probably a little tired of all of the fluffy romantic comedies, but to do a film like this was probably not the kind of exposure (wink, wink) her career needed.
The movie is unnecessarily dark and explicit, as the graphic sex and language do precious little to contribute to the plot.  The Supreme Court knows pornography when it sees it, and so do I.  This, my friends, is essentially mass-market porn with a thread of a plot.
Other than Ryan, few of the characters are particularly interesting, especially Ruffalo's tough-guy cop and Jennifer Jason Leigh's whiny half-sister.  In fact, Leigh's character is so annoying that I felt relief instead of pity when her character met her fate.  The only other character of interest is an all-too-brief appearance by Kevin Bacon as a disturbed ex-boyfriend trapped in a storyline that doesn't go anywhere in particular.  Bacon deserves better.
Even Campion's filmmaking is poor in this outing.  The pace of the film for the first hour will have you constantly checking your watch and wondering if the film will ever make any sense.  To its credit, the film does redeem itself somewhat in the final act, leading the viewer convincingly down one path and then changing course dramatically and abruptly.  If not for the hour and a half of lasciviousness leading up to the ending, the film might actually be reasonably good.  As it stands, it comes off as an almost porn-noir attempt at an art film.",1076976000,32,1571,4.742647058823529
1964596,1,B0000ZMGWK,"First, the plot here is non-sensical. It is choppy, inconsistent, and highly unoriginal. The director attempts to mask this by over-stylizing the film. What is the point behind even having a serial killer here? It is really just a subplot to a twisted romance. Then, to add insult to injury, the violence is graphic and sensationalistic. What is the point behind having a killer that ""disarticulates"" his victims? Why does he put an engagement ring on their fingers? Why is Meg Ryan's character even attracted to this cop who she suspects to be a killer with a fondness for prostitutes? Why is Mark Ruffalo's character such a complete and utter jerk with a disgusting mouth and all the charm of a pencil? There are so many ""whys"" to this film that I could go on forever!
Second, there is not one likeable character in this film. Ryan's character is cold and obnoxious. Ruffalo's character, along with his partner, is a slimy, stereotypical, crude police officer, right down to the mustache. The relationship between these two is so lacking in chemistry or believability it is funny.
Third, Ryan's performance is trash. Just because it is different for her, doesn't mean it's good. A mannequin could have played this role with equal effectiveness.
Fourth, Jane Campion's directing abilities are highly overrated. If a ""nobody"" would have wanted to make this film, they wouldn't have gotten the chance. Campion's attempts to add a feminist undercurrent to everything is hackneyed and ineffective. This film is not only an insult to women and feminist ideaology, it is an insult to humanity. Anyone who tries to intellectualize this film is wasting their time. It's garbage-- plain and simple.

1964597,3,B0000ZMGWK,"""In the Cut"" is provocative director Jane Campion's (""The Piano"", ""Holy Smoke"") attempt at a mainstream erotic thriller. The result is a beautifully executed, well-acted movie that just can't overcome the mediocre material.

The performances in this film are all really very good. Meg Ryan, playing totally against type, is terrific as Frannie, an icy, repressed schoolteacher who finds herself caught up in the investigation of a local serial killer. Mark Ruffalo is also excellent playing the creepily charming homicide detective investigating the case, who also becomes Frannie's love interest. Jennifer Jason Leigh has a supporting role as Frannie's doomed, promiscuous sister, and she's terrific as usual (although wasted in a role that an actress as good as she could probably play in her sleep). Ryan and Ruffalo do have good chemistry and generate plenty of heat together.

Unfortunately, the script of the film is just not very good. The murder mystery/psychological thriller aspect of the film isn't nearly as interesting as the chemistry of its leads, and toward the end of the film the story descends into typical, by-the-numbers serial killer fare, complete with a cartoonish, evil villian and all.

1964598,3,B0000ZMGWK,"Jane Campion's In the Cut is very hip, great ciematography, interesting story, but all in all it just kind of lulls around for 2 hours.  Since this movie is in the erotic suspense genre, one would expect that it would be the type of movie that keeps you glued to your television screen with interest.  However, despite Meg Ryan's allure, and the hipness of the film, something seems a little disjointed that didn't capture my full attention.  Namely, the plot can't make up its mind whether the movie is about sex, or if it is a thriller, and the two don't work together as well as Campion intended.
This was a great role for Meg Ryan.  She wore brown contacts and dyed her hair brown to ditch her All-american blonde hair/blue eyed look that has won her the title of queen of romantic comedies.  She showed that she is quite capable as a sex object, and not in the cutesy ""Sleepless in Seattle""/""You've Got Mail"" way.  Her acting is really top notch, and hopefully this role will allow her to break free from her typecast to a wider spectrum of roles.
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Ruffalo did a fine job as supporting cast.  However, as I said before, the main problem with this movie is that as a thriller it ultimately fails.  Thrillers main goals should be at least to keep the audience's attention, and this movie was unsuccesful in achieving this goal.",1076889600,,1354,4.54320987654321

1964600,2,B0000ZMGWK,"IN THE CUT, as a movie, is just another movie. It tries to be more, with artistic camera use and dramatically quiet moments that lull you. Camera shots with focus adjustments to give you an uneasiness. Camera angles that are a little off kilter. Poems displayed on the subway that intend deeper meaning.
Not to mention, a level of erotica that probably hasn't been attempted since the 70's. The movie is very explicit and exceedingly perverted in its dialogue. THIS is the most important thing about IN THE CUT. Not the level of explicitness, but the fact that goody goody romantic comedy sweetheart Meg Ryan is the subject of this explicitness.
This was a very risky and successful turn for Meg Ryan. If she is to escape her reputation and try to find a niche in some different, more meaty movies, then IN THE CUT can most certainly do this for her.
As far as the movie goes though, all the artsy pretentious melodramatic moments aside, this movie has no story. Bottom line, all the creativity that went into the camera direction and its attempt to be VISUALLY and MOODLY creative, should have been put into putting together a more unique and worthy story to tell.
Take all the fluff and camera tricks away, and you have just another movie with the same ending we've seen a hundred times, with unappealing characters, and an empty feeling of a movie that didn't really have a whole lot to offer.",1076803200,,1396,4.633064516129032
1964601,5,B0000ZMGWK,"Jane Campion had the courage to transform Susanna Moore's novel IN THE CUT into one of the more challenging and risk-taking dark movies in some time.  Co-writing the screenplay with Moore and directing as well, Campion shows that she knows her way around the Grand Guignol oeuvre, and the result is a terrifyingly real depiction of the madness of serial killing - well, murder - in any form.
Meg Ryan is well cast as Frannie, a fragile woman who teaches English in a seamy section of New York, who is unpartnered, physically frustrated, and has a sister (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who is as opposite to her as they come.  Ryan accidentally views an sex act in the basement of a bar that sets her on edge when a body part (that's right, a portion of a disarticulated dead murder victim) is uncovered in the garden by her building, and that body part belongs to the woman she viewed at the bar. She is questioned by a detective (Mark Rufallo, showing us further that his range of acting is enormous) with whom she has an approach/avoidance conflict.  Ryan slowly becomes physically involved with the detective, who protects her when she is mugged. More bizarre murders occur and the suspense as to the  identity of the killer mounts. The story unfolds so gradually and heinously that offering any more clues might destroy the impact of this taut thriller.  Suffice it to say that Evil is not unveiled in identity until the end.  The supporting roles are all handled with conviction by Nick Damici (as smarmy a cop as has ever been drawn), Kevin Bacon as a borderline sicko medical student, among many others.
This is a very dark film that explores outer reaches of sensuality and death.  The cinematography is brilliant in making the darkness of the city and the story radiant with composed silhouettes of buildings against harsh and mysterious skies.  Not a movie for the faint of heart but for those who appreciate the macabre, this is a first rate slice (!) of it.",1076544000,3,1961,4.680232558139535

Meg Ryan actually chose a decent script and did some acting that contained depth, probably the smartest move that she has ever made. Who wants to be America's Sweetheart, anyway? I am not sure why people would think this movie is slow or lacking any kind of plot, it actually has a fairly solid foundation and  thick, interesting plot points compared to most movies out there. It isn't just a serial killer flick either, it is incredibly dark and sexy. I also have an incredibly huge crush on Mark Ruffalo now, he really took charge of his character and is really, really, really sexy.

I read where she wanted to get away from her ""america's sweetheart"" image.  But my advice to her is to go back where she started.  She looked like a washed-out has-been in this movie, and I always thought she was kind of cute.

1964606,4,B0000ZMGWK,"Pay attention to the fact that this is the ""unrated and uncut director's edition"" of ""In the Cut,"" because when you get to the part that merits this distinction you will either do a double-take or your jaw will just drop (or both).  Actually, there are two scenes with added footage, but the first one is much more noticeable (and graphic).  I can just imagine some Meg Ryan fan is going to pop this into the DVD player with the kiddies in the room and suddenly find themselves wishing they were watching something safe like the halftime show at the Super Bowl.  You were warned.
""In the Cut"" is the movie where Meg Ryan gets naked, which is apparently the easiest way to refer to this 2003 film, which is directed by Jane Champion and adapted from by the director and the writer from the novel by Susanna Moore.  The nudity is appropriate because Meg Ryan's character, Frannie Avery, is a sexual creature and the motivation for most of which she does in this film is sexual in nature.  Besides, Frannie looks and acts differently enough from her other roles that I had no problem thinking this was Frannie naked and not Meg Ryan.  You can argue that her nudity should have been in the service of a much better film (i.e., something on the level of ""The Piano""), but I do not think you can fault its honesty in this film.
At its core ""In the Cut"" is a slasher flick, but one that pays little attention to the slasher when they are doing their evil deeds.  The focus is on Frannie and the way that she insists on treading into dangerous waters because apparently that is where there is really great sex.  After a woman is brutally murdered and ""dearticulated,"" Frannie meets homicide detective James Malloy (Mark Ruffalo), who is investigating the case.  She thinks she has seen him and he is interested in her.  He is rather crude, but it turns out he can deliver in the bedroom and the fact that Frannie is suspicious about who he really is does not matter anymore, even as the killings start coming closer to home for her.  Apparently great sex or even the possibility of great sex is worth dying for in the world in which Frannie lives.  The most real relationship Frannie has is with her half-sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and while they have some realistic and earnest talks about their sex lives, her sister only serves to enable Pauline to walk on the wild side.
The relationship between Frannie and Malloy (the term ""romance"" does not apply) might be strange and weird but it at least feels real.  The problem with ""In the Cut"" is in the thriller part of the equation, because the obvious answer is so obviously wrong that figuring out the mystery part is not that difficult.  Fortunately the slasher part of the equation is ultimately the less important part of the story, which is a strange and weird statement to make, but watch the movie and it will make sense.
Actually, the part at which I thought the film went too far was, oddly enough, a pivotal scene set at the Little Red Lighthouse beneath the George Washington Bridge.  When Captain Kangaroo died I reviewed that book, because of the strong association I had with it and the beloved Captain, so seeing it as a setting in this movie was one of those things that inspired sudden visions of grave spinning.  Of course, if I had seen this film a month earlier I would not have had that reaction.",1076457600,6,3371,4.528830313014827

1964609,5,B0000ZMGWK,"New Zealand's Jane Campion is one of the few directors around still to have a vision and a texture of their personallity in their work . 2003's In The Cut finds her mixing dark visuals of poetry and lust with gore in order to tell the story of Frannie , an english teacher who starts a relationship with a cop who investigates a series of murders of beautiful women in the area .
  As one would expect , Campion wouldn't get out of bed just to direct a typical "" erotic thriller "" . She prefers to focus more on her central character's psychological potrait than to the mystery itself . Despite the fact that Frannie is a sensitive , closed-to-herself female , here we watch her chose passion over safety . Campion's nightmare-like , beautyfully crafted touches are simply ravishing : the bride waiting for a wagon in the metro station , the scenes with the two lovers skating ...somehow she manages to create something so ethereal and haunting at the same time . Furthermore the acting is truly exceptional with Ryan giving a brave , quiet perfomance  - certaintly her most amazing yet while Leigh and Bacon offer precious supporting turns .  Ruffalo delivers a good perfomance as well although an actor with more poisonous charms than his ( Viggo Mortensen perhaps ) would have been a wiser choice .
  Yes , there are some plot problems in the script but still , In The Cut should be checked out by everyone who loves good cinema . It has more atmosphere and spirit than the rest of the thrillers of the last few years add up together .",1074038400,3,1538,4.475
1964610,3,B0000ZMGWK,"Frannie (Meg Ryan) is a depressed and homely (in a beatifully and naturally, potentially untapped sorta way) English teacher troubled by emotional issues and demons of the past. She fantasizes and dreams of passion to escape her everyday dreary existence. She almost represents the saint by day sinner by night persona who soon becomes sexually involved with a hard edged,uncouth, take no crap detective investigating a series of gruesome murders. Malloy is overconfident, cocky and arrogant yet has his soft side or spot for Frannie. She is questioned by detective Malloy after a ""piece"" of evidence ends up in her garden from one of the murders. As the investigation progresses, the two embark on a relationship that will raise eyebrows and pulses. However, as the story advances or relationship progresses there are clues that begin to make Frannie suspect and accuse Malloy of the murders.

Despite it's strong sexual nature, there is a plot or story. Albeit a very predictable one that is overshadowed by the strong and disturbing performances by most of the cast. This is a good thing because this will anchor viewers to an otherwise Hannibal Lecter or Seven wannabe film. Seems everyone in In The Cut has some serious psychological, psychosexual or emotional issues that need working out. This is a film where it is very difficult to feel compassion for any of the characters despite their woes or troubles. They have become bitter, hardened, lonely and isolated in some ways with a dark and brooding unseething nature. This is not one of those films where you can say ""I like her character or persona""---Beware, most of these characters are not likeable in the least sense of the word. What director Campion of In The Cut accomplishes is to show that the characters do not live polished and perfected lives by Hollywood glamorized or perfect family American value standards. It shows human beings with serious and traumatic emotional and psychological problems (this is past Psychology 101---more like 102).  It shows human beings in their most vulnerable and somewhat tortured existence...Therefore , this will be a disturbing film to some.

Other than making viewers develop vertigo from the camera lens jumping around, In The Cut served more as a vehicle for Meg Ryan to finally shed her ""America's Sweetheart"" image (or is that Julia Robert's title). Dark and dreary doesn't even begin to describe the atmosphere of the film. More like morose. Did I mention bloody or gory?  Is the plot or story predicatble and simple? You bet. Don't try to read or search for a deeper meaning because there is none other than to see some fine acting talent. The acting is what will entice the viewer to see Ryan's tremendous performance and character live out her almost obsessive psycho-sexual indulgences or fantasies as an opressed and depressed English teacher. Trust me, Ryan sheds more than her upbeat usual acting gig in this film. This project's atmosphere and characters are best described as grimy and grungy and all seem to have a sleaze factor and some sort of emotional or psychological issue/s. The sexual nature of the film and language is very candid or explicit and not at all what most people would think of as a thriller with a soft romantic or passionate side between the two main characters. Still, I will give In The Cut 3 stars for the excellent performances by it's own stars. As for the story or plot many will be disappointed. What disapponted me the most is the lack of depth of the psychological thriller/mystery portion of the film and it's high predictability simplistic level. It just wrapped up suddenly, too neat and tidy in the end (though it was bloody)...",1071273600,16,3688,4.933977455716586
1964611,5,B0000ZMGWK,"The movie was a great surprise to me and my friends when we went to see it. At first it appeared to be a typical independent type movie, with the usual expectation of a rather depressing outlook on life accompanied with a very raw cinematography, and usually little hope for a happy ending. However this is the first film I've seen that successfully incorporates the rawness and up front honesty of the characters lives, combined with the great, well written storyline and wonderful acting. And the cinematography, although raw, provided some beautiful scenes, and the symbolism and use of focus put the viewer in Franny's mindset of a very creative person, who doesn't see life through typical eyes. It was quite `trippy' and I found it to be very original.
The movie centralises around Franny (Meg Ryan) and her encounter with a police detective (Mark Ruffalo) after she witnesses something that might be important to a murder that is committed. At first it seems that it would be impossible for a relationship to begin between the two but as the movie progresses a surprisingly sweet love story plays out. I first thought that the writers had resigned to a predictable `who done it' in order to focus on the relationship that was blossoming, however I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't realise who the killer was, till it was actually revealed to the audience.
Meg Ryan's performance was brilliant and she really pulls off the change of image well!! And Mark Ruffalo was so magnetic, you can really fall in love with him. His character has a rough surface with a sweet caring middle and Mark Ruffalo really portrays this perfectly.
In The Cut was very dark, yet very enjoyable and satisfying. It has a beautiful balance of eroticism, romance and thriller. My friends and I honestly couldn't stop talking about it for at least three days and we've seen it many times since and still love it!! I've recommended this movie to all my friends!",1070668800,50,1946,4.794642857142857
1964612,5,B0000ZMGWK,"from what has been mentioned in the reviews, this film, most probably will receive PWC rating(meaning pass with cuts like shocking, explict sex, violence and brutal will be history).

1964613,2,B0000ZMGWK,"What is amazing about this terrible movie is that the movie itself was well-executed.  There was suspense, and the acting was well done.  However, the story line was...non-existant? There was zero character development, and the audience was not compelled to care about anything in the movie even momentarily. And then, the movie just ended...stupidly.  This was so bad that it's not even a rental.  It is just breathtakingly terrible and is completely irredeemable.  So so bad.
Everyone leaving the theater was making fun of the member of their party who had chosen the movie.  People were saying things like, ""Was that as bad as I thought it was?""  and ""J-Lo should have been in this one.""  That pretty much says it all.",1068336000,3,721,4.852459016393443
1964614,5,B0000ZMGWK,"if looking for mr. goodbar had been made in 2002, you might expect to see something similiar to jane campion's in the cut. as always, just forget everything you know about psychological films or erotic thrillers so you can truly enjoy watching in the cut. before we get started, this is NOT your typical meg ryan vehicle as there is nothing light-hearted or cute here. if you're still interested, keep reading because this film is definately for those of us who want a little something different at the multiplex nowadays. unlike most thrillers in this genre, in the cut is more of a pyschological statement about sexuality as viewed by thinking women & some men or perhaps just a very dark poem. either way, i believe it's a terrific film by a genius director who gave us the piano nearly ten years ago. just like the piano, there are scenes of eroticism which will either entice you, haunt you, or just somehow linger in your head for days. most of the scenes aren't as graphic as the reviews might suggest but still are very deserving of a medium rare R-rating. no, most parents won't be taking their kids to see this one. also, there is a great deal of graphic dialogue describing sexual activity of all kinds so you may not want to watch this one in mixed company. again, very atypical of your average run-of-the-mill meg ryan vehicle. one of the greatest things about this film is the lighting & the jerky camera movement which you usually don't see in the mainstream films. trust me, the film makers here knew exactly what effect they were going for & the visuals add to the already gritty plot & the overall disturbing atmosphere of in the cut. as i can't really comment on susanna moore's book, i can only say that i do believe the film would  be atleast a decent adaptation of her story considering she was involved quite a bit with the maing of the movie. i have been told(which i cannot substantiate) that the movie is actually more graphic than the book which may also shock some viewers. one more interesting trivia piece is that evidentally the film was so graphic that nearly 7 minutes had to trimmed from the original submission just to obtain the R-rating. for those of us who can only see the unedited versions of controversial films like this, we are hoping dvd world will release a special edition sometime down the road. the film starts out with one of the visually stunning openings i've seen in some time & will hold your interest until the last scene. unlike most films, everything you see here serves a purpose in the grand scheme of things. yes, even down to the charm bracelet gift & the wedding rings story told by our protagonist. watch for clues because everything here fits somehow & interlocks beautifully. for those of you who don't like artsy films, you will not be overwhelmed because most ends are tied up neatly when all is said & done so this may have a broader appeal than the piano or other great campion films in this repect. it's difficult to say more without giving away too much of the plot & the overall viewing experience but i will say that this is one of the best films i've seen in my local theatre in sometime. happy viewing!",1068336000,6,3176,4.542757417102967
1964615,1,B0000ZMGWK,"I will not be trying to describe the plot - other reviewers will tell you, in enough detail, what happens in the film. There are generous helpings of blood and nudity - and there is very intense camera work, partial-focus shots and plenty of dark color. The trouble is, there is very little else.
It is true that sometimes films that make you think have a lot of violence, and nudity, and sex, and disturbing scenes. I have no problem with that. Regrettably, not every film full of nudity and chopped body parts makes you think, and this one does not.
It does get you depressed, it makes you realize how much Meg Ryan's charm is dependent upon her hairstyle, and the cops do admirable Noo Yawk accent. Is that enough to justify two hours in a movie theatre? Don't think so.
As for camera work: yes, it makes you realize that some things are better in small doses. What works for 30 second clip, gets annoying in two-hour feature. The pumped-up dense ultra-arty camera CAN get on your nerves; there CAN be too much of a good thing.
And finally, the use of the opening and closing credits tune (Whatever Will Be Will Be) is unoriginal: after Heathers (another disturbing film, which however is clever and thought-provoking; one of the best roles of Winona Ryder, incidentally), you kinda know that a childish, cute and melodic tune is an introduction for a couple of hours of sickening tension and horror.",1068336000,4,1403,4.616
1964616,3,B0000ZMGWK,"IN THE CUT has Meg Ryan doing sweaty, naughty stuff with Mark Ruffalo that she never did in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE. Oh, lawdy, lawdy!
Meg is Franny Avery, an English teacher/writer in New York that evidently spends her days dreamily writing down poetic sayings she notices on the adverts posted in subway cars, and her nights sweating through fevered prurient dreams. She also spends a lot of time with her half-sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh), another sexually needy woman, who rents an apartment over a strip club.
One day, Franny is approached by homicide detective James Malloy (Ruffalo). ""A piece of a murdered girl was found in your garden. Have you noticed anything unusual lately?"" Avery did notice a distinctive tattoo on Malloy's arm. Disconcertingly, she'd seen a shadowy man with the same tattoo in the dark recesses of a bar's basement doing kinky things with a woman. The woman that was ultimately carved up. But, girls, does Franny have the good sense to avoid an emotional entanglement of the type your mothers warned you about? Nope.
As a keen fan of Meg Ryan from her appearances in romantic comedies, I admit to being raptly attentive to her eye-popping and stereotype-busting role in this film. But, after slapping myself in the face with a cold, wet towel and saying, ""Steady on, lad"", I realized that IN THE CUT really doesn't have much to offer besides Franny's nudity and her fooling around with Malloy's handcuffs.
Ruffalo is effective as the unpolished and often boorish Bad Boy detective. Even Dirty Harry had better manners.
Admittedly, director Jane Campion adds some really nice tactile and sensory touches, like the opening sequence, which includes a ""snowfall"" of flower petals and the haunting sound of wind chimes. Or the close-up of Franny's fingers on Malloy's creased and worn business card. However, as a suspense drama, the film is oddly listless; I never felt that Avery was in mortal peril, not even at the end in the Final Confrontation.
IN THE CUT is a hard, gritty, totally unromantic piece about as far from the SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE genre as one can get. Perhaps that's why Meg did it. You go, girl!",1067990400,4,2148,4.887671232876713
1964617,3,B0000ZMGWK,"With `In the Cut,' Meg Ryan decided to take a bold step.  She completely shatters the ""nice cute girl"" image she's maintained for years in films like `Sleepless in Seattle' and `You've Got Mail.'  This time, Ryan plays a New York school teacher who's bored to death and basically looking for sexual fulfillment.  She accidentally witnesses a couple in a bar and later discovers that the man brutally killed the woman.  When she is questioned by a local detective, she suspects that she may be in more danger than she thinks.
`In the Cut' begins as a smart thriller that doesn't act like a typical thriller.  The lack of thriller clichs early on is refreshing, and the performances, direction, and feel of the film give an eerie, satisfying experience.  For awhile.
Without giving away the plot, I can tell you that all of the characters in the film lose about 50 IQ points after the first hour.  You begin to wonder what motivates these characters and question why some of them are in the film at all.  Holes in the plot abound and some scenes will just plain leave you shaking your head.
I felt really bad for Meg Ryan.  She really risked a lot to play this role.  It's unfortunate that it wasn't in a better film.  This performance may surprise a lot of people.
One final note.  The film is loaded with sex and violence (although most of the violence occurs off-screen).  Throughout the film, director Jane Campion focuses on the American flag for several seconds at a time.  She seems to be saying that sex and violence are part of who we are as a country.  For me, this was the most thought-provoking aspect of the film.  Too bad the story wasn't as thought-provoking as the flag.",1067990400,2,1684,4.5633333333333335
1964618,4,B0000ZMGWK,"The New York City of ""In the Cut"" is the NYC of tenements, Spanish Harlem, West Broadway and sweaty Strip joints with almost naked performers. It's summer, It's Hot and a murderer is on the loose.
Into this jungle comes an English Teacher, writer and fish-out-of-water, Frannie Avery (Meg Ryan). But Frannie may seem out of place in this environment, what with her sensible below-the-knee skirts, her floral blouses and flat sandals, but she's not. Because what Frannie really is, is a domesticated cat that has learned to roam this jungle with the wild. untamed lions and tigers. She is very similar to Isabel Archer in Campion's ""Portrait of a Lady"" in that she is refined, educated but just below the surface there breathes a sensual, fully realized hedonist.
Until about 1/3 of the way through ""In the Cut,"" Ryan's performance as Frannie is problematic. She chooses to lower her voice to a whiskey and cigarette snarl that spells fakery not acting. But after that, her performance evens out, her voice gets closer to its natural register and we start sensing that there is truth and honesty in her performance. In a lot of ways, Ryan's performance reminds me of Diane Keaton's in ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar,"" in it's intensity and abandon. Oddly enough, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Frannie's sister, Pauline could have probably played Frannie with her eyes closed but here she plays a stripper with a heart of gold.
Mark Ruffalo is the real revelation though, playing a hard nosed, though pretty-boy NYC detective and Frannie's lover who fulfills and plays into all of Frannie's fantasies. Ruffalo has never been more virile and sensual on screen and for once he doesn't play the sensitive loser that everyone wants to protect. He's the protector here and he's first rate.
New York City has never looked more beautiful and the camera work is gorgeous capturing all that is ugly and garish while also capturing all that is lovely and breathtaking. Campion has stuck her neck out creatively and not every thing she does succeeds but at least she understands that she must risk the ridiculous sometimes in order to achieve the sublime.",1067904000,7,2130,4.886740331491713

At the start of the film there were 15 people in the cinema, when I walked out after around an hour there was only one person left, she followed me out straight away (apparently I woke her up!!)

I have seen B movies from the 60s and 70s that were better than this choppy piece of nonsense. Those who think this mess of a film was artistic must have watched it under the influence of something. A snail moves faster than this movie. It moved very slowly with characters that had no moral compass and seemed to care only about casual sex. I was not offended by that; I just found it unnecessary and boring. The script was a snoozefest. There was no character development in this movie and few redeeming qualities in any of the characters so, as a viewer, I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them. The plot was also predictable. It was obvious from the beginning that there were 3 characters who could be the killer. However, for anyone who has ever watched a murder mystery, you know to immediately scratch off the obvious one as the killer. So, that left two possibilities and it didn't take long into the movie to figure out who the killer was. Watching this dud is time (and money) wasted I will never get back.
