Unfortunately I can't speak German, so I can't understand what Mr. Latsabidze is saying, but I do understand his masterful playing and the gift projecting from his eyes! His technique and colors are just unbelievable! It's worth to buy and add to your classical music dvd collection.",1298764800,,297,5.081632653061225
