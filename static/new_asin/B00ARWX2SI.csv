5495065,5,B00ARWX2SI,"I loved this series! Gave it 4 stars only because I hated the abrupt ending with Calvin. Poorly done. Maybe a season 11 would be nice in order to clear things up abit? But, then, too much time has passed. Well, Tyler Perry brought them back on 'The Paynes'! Curtis cracks me up! Glad I bought the entire season show. Always good for a good laugh!",1361404800,8,346,4.257575757575758

5495088,5,B00ARWX2SI,Great show however I am not happy to be stuck on a cliff hanger for two years not knowing what happens next. I don't understand the two year delay in releasing the remainder of this series to complete my collection and finally find out what happens. I called Lionsgate shop customer service at 1-877-230-2756 (last known company affiliate) and was told that there has not been that high of a demand to release the remainding episodes. The reps advice was to call and demand the release on DVD of the  remaining episodes. I hope we don't have to wait years like the jeffersons.,1446076800,14,576,4.592233009708738

There was nothing I dislike about it, I loved it and it was inspiring. when i watch this show; I take a part of me and put it in place of the character that I want to be like to better myself, including attitude and all. Instead of frowning everyday, I want to smile. Instead of throwing tempers, I want to find a way that will help both parties/better the situation. Instead of judging, I want to help.
