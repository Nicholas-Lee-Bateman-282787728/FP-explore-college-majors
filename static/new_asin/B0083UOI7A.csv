8524809,4,B0083UOI7A,"In STARS FALLING FROM THE SKY, a twenty-five year old uncaring female Korean insurance salesperson has her unruffled life ruffled beyond belief when her parents are killed in an auto accident that later is revealed may have been no accident after all. Before their accident, her biggest problem had been mooning over a five year crush she has had on her boss who is a surly sort and does not see her as anything more than a working woman. After their accident, she is faced with caring for her five young siblings. She has no experience with decision making but has to grow up in a hurry and learn how to care for them. The thrust of the movie is on her transformation from a woman of few values to one who is consumed with providing a stable home life for her siblings. Everything else must take second place including her own love life. She is forced to take a series of menial jobs including one as a ""hostess"" in a sleazy bar to make ends meet. Eventually she finds work as a live in maid/cook/housekeeper for her boss. Slowly she develops feelings for him even as he cannot understand why he is even mildly attracted to her. STARS FALLING FROM THE SKY is an odd mixture of gritty realism with some hokey comedy and goofy characterization by her boss's nephew who loudly proclaims his love for her. There are several subplots of misguided love which meander throughout the series before the finale which suggests that grit and determination can overcome financial issues even if matters of the heart are less easily solved. I had a problem with the last few episodes which seemed to leave unanswered some basic questions of how and why the heroine's parents died but the series is a compelling look at how one family managed to bring order out of chaos.",1400112000,,1757,4.563291139240507

Besides their biological and oldest child, Pal Yang, (Red) they also have five adopted children, whose ages range from 1 to 14 and are named after the colors of the rainbow. One night something terrible happens that changes there lives forever, Jin Pal Yang's parents are killed in a car accident. She is forced to take care of her five young siblings, but they are soon kicked out of their home. Life becomes too difficult and uncertain and Pal Yang almost abandons her siblings at an orphanage, but ends up making a promise that they will stick together no matter what. She makes the painful decision to live no longer as a woman, but as a mother from there on.

After much discussion, they are able to stay in the house, but fighting, incidents, and many misunderstandings happen. But Pal Yang also finds out that her parents deaths were no accident. And their killer is someone associated with Won Kang Ha. But during all this chaos, love triangles form, secrets are revealed, and justice is served. The siblings come to realize after working through their hardships that ""family"" is what you make for yourself, not what you're born into.

This is a great romantic comedy about love and family. There are so many charming characters in the show. There is plenty of laugh-out-loud comedy, as well as realistic hardships that can leave almost anyone teary-eyed. This is a great, creative, and fun drama that I recommend giving a try.

(Amazon is currently out of good copies of this DVD. Until they get more in, this show is shown on Amazon, HuluPlus, and Netflix.)",1390089600,3,2375,4.715662650602409
8524811,2,B0083UOI7A,"Do NOT buy this version of Stars Falling From The Sky. It is a bootleg all the way! There are not just one but TWO constant annoying logos running through the whole print! As if they weren't annoying enough, in addition there are NEWS TICKERS running on the bottom of the screen at times!!! Someone in Korea obviously recorded this off television and used a common lay person's program called TMPEG to even make the cheesy menus!!!

The show itself is adorable and is available in excellent quality on Instant Netflix, without all the ""bugs"". I hate spending this much money for a boxset only to find that I've been ripped off by bootleggers on Amazon! Amazon should PULL this product without delay. It is ILLEGAL.",1377734400,2,714,4.666666666666667
8524812,5,B0083UOI7A,"I love Korean drama, and this is one of my personal favorites. It's about a young woman who is forced to grow up when her parents die and take over the responsibility of her younger siblings. The acting is believable, and I laughed and cried my way through the drama along with the main character. If you liked Playful Kiss or Tell me Lies, then you'll probably enjoy Stars Falling From the Sky.",1349740800,5,395,4.424657534246576
8524813,5,B0083UOI7A,I saw this on Netflix and loved it.  It is one of the better Korean Dramas I have seen.  I laughed and cried. I really want to buy this . Am so sorry that Amazon is out of it.  Hope they hurry and get it back soon,1339027200,3,213,3.4893617021276597
