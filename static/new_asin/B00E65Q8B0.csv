8601774,5,B00E65Q8B0,"I loved this dvd. Metallica plays a song at the golden gods 2014 with Rob Halford of the Mighty Judas Priest! Riff after riff and solo after solo, not to mention the hashly barked and bleak growling vocals of James Hetfield are a sight and sound to behold as Metallica dominate the metal stage as usual. Contains fantastic rarities such as Disposable Heroes, Orion and All Nightmare Long.  Sound and picture quality is quite good.  A must have for any Metallica fan. Buy it now!",1531094400,,478,4.6117647058823525
