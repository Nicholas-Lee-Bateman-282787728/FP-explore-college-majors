5819296,5,B00DJ44NUW,I never seen a DVD horror collection like this one! It has great picture and sound quality which is good especially that the movies are old! I strongly recommend any one who likes horror to get this collection!,1390608000,9,210,4.552631578947368
5819297,3,B00DJ44NUW,"I like a variety of different movies-this was at a low price- so I ordered - to watch on a ""rainey & nothing elso to do day...",1390435200,4,126,3.7037037037037037
5819298,5,B00DJ44NUW,"Make sure you've got a bullet to bite on while viewing these babies! This is schlock in its purest, most lethal form! MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE takes us right into the deep waters of the sludge pool, exposing us to ""The Master"" and his waddling henchman, ""Torgo"". Beware the Master's brides and their idiotic fight of doom! One of the most heinous movie non-productions to ever mold the screen! TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST gives us an unbridled dose of ultra-dullness w/ a hilarious monster-on-the-loose. BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS is guaranteed to cause substantial brain-smoothing! Tor Johnson lumbers through the desert, looking dazed (as usual), while nonsensical narration corrodes the mind! THE APE MAN features Bela Lugosi looking unlike any ape ever filmed, sporting a very Amish-like beard. He does sleep in a cage w/ his gorilla friend though! THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN is about a secret group that breaks a criminal out of prison, so they can use ra-di-a-tion on him and make him invisible. Its one saving grace is the inclusion of the ever-lovely Marguerite Chapman (FLIGHT TO MARS). THE ATOMIC BRAIN contains mad science! An old woman wants her brain put into a young body. Beware the hideous dog-man! DEMENTIA 13 is one that just might rise above the others in this collection. It's dark, grim, and foreboding, w/ only a slight hint of cheeeze! Still, it does have its moments of sublime idiocy! It's an axe-murderer movie after all! UNKNOWN WORLD has a team of adventurers using a huge machine to drill their way to the Earth's interior. No monsters or mutants here, just rocks and the occasional flood. Even so, this movie is far less ridiculous than any other on this set! THE TERROR has Boris Karloff and a very young Jack Nicholson. Not bad for a Roger Corman epic. MESA OF LOST WOMEN returns us to true schlock country. A mad scientist (Jackie ""Fester"" Coogan) is using his secret serum to turn beautiful women into deadly spider women! Includes the infamous ""Tarantella"" dance performed by the character, ""Tarantella""! Also has a soundtrack resembling a hammer-handed baboon banging on a piano! INCREDIBLE PETRIFIED WORLD is another soul-scorcher! A group of deep sea divers find an underwater cave system. They spend the majority of the film's running time wandering around aimlessly! THE BEST OF THE WORST 12 MOVIE COLLECTION is a masterful selection of cinematic agony, designed to test the mettle of anyone brave enough to make the attempt...",1383523200,23,2458,4.9396135265700485

5819308,4,B00DJ44NUW,"Finally a movie collection that has the ""Gravatas"" to call it like it is.  And that's EXACTLY what you have here, Mill creek Entertainment's The Best of the Worst.  Many of these were in other collections put out by Mill Creek prior to this.  But never in just a collection like this.
  So do yourself a favor.  Get this collection, grab your popcorn bucket, and sit down to watch ""The Best Of The Worst""",1405123200,8,404,4.391891891891892

8593660,5,B00DJ44NUW,"Who doesn't love old B Movies?!  These are great for all generations.  Older viewers remember these features at the drive in, younger people remember them from Mystery Science Theater or late night creature flicks, and kids love the campy, silly nature.  For this price, why not own some painfully bad, but nostalgically good old movies?!",1487548800,,338,5.109090909090909
8593661,3,B00DJ44NUW,These movies are so bad I'm surprised they stuck to the disc. I give this Three Stars because the case can also be used as a coaster for your drink.,1485993600,,148,3.966666666666667

8593666,1,B00DJ44NUW,"TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST has passable color, is between VHS and SD quality picture. 1.37:1 picture, only available in this collection and there is nothing to compare it to. MANOS THE HANDS OF FATE has washed out color, 1.37:1, looks cramped, dubbed and if you really want this, buy the restored BD version.

EEGAH has washed out color too, is 1.37:1 and the picture looks okay. and there is nothing to compare it to. BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS runs 53:44, 1.37:1 picture, good contrast and picture. Almost as good as the Image version, except the beginning has some of the nudity removed. Buy the Image version.

Only buy this collection for those 3 movies (not BoYF) I just mentioned, all the rest are garbage prints!

Oh, and buy this for THE ATOMIC BRAIN because it starts with that title. The Something Weird Video version starts with no title, with credits and at about 1:52 minutes it shows the title, MONSTROSITY. This version doesn't have that at that time mark. So, you have to get this collection to have both versions.

The other discs to get are:

Roger Corman Horror Classics Vol. I
Image, Wade Williams Production
Something Weird Video
Sci-fi Invasion
Movies 4 you, More Sci-fi Classics",1452038400,10,1193,4.716346153846154
