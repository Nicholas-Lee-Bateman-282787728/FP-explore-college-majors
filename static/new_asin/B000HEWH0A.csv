2637238,3,B000HEWH0A,"Considering that the stories on which this series was based were written by an American lady, the programmes are excellent. Both stars are well drawn; particularly Sharon Small, and the scenery alone makes the series worth watching.

Agatha Christie it may be not, but an entertaining, beautifully filmed series it is.",1184025600,3,318,5.235294117647059
2637239,4,B000HEWH0A,"My husband and I love British mysteries.  I read many of the books years ago and was delighted to find them on PBS.  We have now started to purchase sets. We really enjoyed this series but found Inspector Lynley to be overly harsh to Havers, his DS.  I don't remember him being quite so rude in the books. We were not happy with the abrupt ending of the series - many plot lines left unfinished and we're disappointed to not have answers to our questions.  The quality of the series was great - well photographed, great dialogue, good plots. I'd buy it again.",1183420800,,559,4.398058252427185
2637240,5,B000HEWH0A,"I've been a long time fan of the good inspector and the Inspector Lynley Mysteries are a cut above the rest, because it really concentrates on the complex relationship between Lynley and Havers.  It's not just who dunnit, but more about how Lynley and Havers go about solving it that makes it compelling  viewing.

This dvd set, with 17 dvds ( including a Great Deliverance) is like a  big box of chocolates -  watching it is an absolute treat.  If you watch in order, you can see how their relationship evolves from their first reluctant pairing to the genuine friendship that develops.

The acting is  sublime - Nathaniel Parker really shows Lynley to be a complex character ( as is the protagonist in Elizabeth George's books) and he captures Lynley's emotions well.  Lynley is unlike other British detectives who seem fairly one dimensional and rather wooden. Sharon Small is also outstanding as Havers  - from the ugly duckling  early days to the assured, s  strong character she becomes.  Both characters seem very real, again, unlike other detective series and to get these two fine British actors sparring off each other for over 25 hours is television heaven.

All in all, a great DVD collection to own.  Bring on Series 5 and 6 please!",1181606400,3,1245,4.779342723004695
2637241,5,B000HEWH0A,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inspector-Lynley-Mysteries-Vol-1-4/dp/B000HEWH0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Vol. 1-4</a>&nbsp;British murder mysteries are considered by most to be the most sophisticated, and the Inspector Lynley mysteries are second only to Midsomer Murders in quality.  The acting by Nathanial Parker (Lynley) and Sharon Small (Havers) is convincing and their intereactions with each other consistently provide a secondary but interesting subplot within the main mystery.  The only tiresome part of this series involves the trial and tribulations created by Havers demented mother who is as annoying as she is unlikeable.  What realism and character development this might provide is offset by the distraction.  Fortunately, this sideshow diminishes in importance with each episode.  And each episode is outstanding with enough clues provided to help give the viewer a fighting chance to solve the crime, but enough false clues to make it difficult (and for this reviewer, almost always impossible).  The end result is that you can watch these episodes 3 or 4 times and catch nuances that were missed the first time, and enjoy the acting, which is consistently excellent.  If you like Midsomer Murders, you will like these mysteries as well.  And these are a much better deal.",1180828800,8,1368,5.97948717948718
2637242,4,B000HEWH0A,The Inspector Lynley mysteries have a certain level of complexity that is not found elsewhere.  Modern and realistic with a very real human side adds up to great entertainment.,1179014400,,176,5.068965517241379
2637243,5,B000HEWH0A,I liked this British Mystery Series very much. Would recommend it to anyone.,1178409600,,76,4.923076923076923
2637244,4,B000HEWH0A,"I really enjoy all the of dvd's in this collection as well as the discounted prices however i did not have to purchase the ""a great deliverence dvd because it was already inclued in the vol 1 thru 4...i can't wait until series 5 & 6 come out....",1174435200,3,245,4.125
2637245,5,B000HEWH0A,I have long loved the Inspector Lyndley series because the focus is characterization rather than just 'who done it?' which makes this detective series very special.  Watching these videos at my leisure and in sequencial order allows me an immediacy in tracking the development of the characters.  Also I have enjoyed going back to the novels and studying how and why changes were made for the film versions. I highly recommend this series for any serious mystery and/or film lovers.  Writers can find much to learn from them as well.,1168300800,12,533,4.9
8139549,3,B000HEWH0A,"Love the show. The dvd's... some play on my player, some not. At your own risk.",1484438400,,79,4.0
8139550,4,B000HEWH0A,"I'm delighted with this series and am glad that I bought the whole thing.  Nathaniel Parker is the perfect Lord Asherton-Inspector Lynley combination.  Great contrast to the definitely non-aristocratic sidekick Sgt. Barbara Havers (Sharon Small), who dismisses the upper classes and their pretensions in a way that helps Lynley see things from a completely fresh perspective.  Havers, on the other hand, doesn't seem likely to alter her impression of the silliness and arrogance of the old families wiht their old houses.

The murder stories are intriguing and the production is top-notch.  In my opinion, the only drawback is mopey Helen, the woman with whom Lynley seems inextractibly entangled in spite of the fact that she never seems willing to give him any certainty, one way or the other, about their future.  When she appears on the scene, Lynley also becomes mopey and wishy-washy.  He seems much happier when at work with Havers, with whom he spends almost all of his waking hours.  Their relationship is work-oriented, with a gradually developed friendship.",1409616000,2,1068,5.204678362573099
8139551,5,B000HEWH0A,"Inspector Lynley is in the finest tradition of BBC Mystery. The stark constrast between Lynley and Havers works ""perfectly"". Plots are well crafted. I only wish they packaged all 6 series in one. That said, this compilation is a gem!!!",1336262400,,235,4.9
8139552,3,B000HEWH0A,"i enjoyed watching this series tho i have not read the books. the series gets better as it goes along. only later did i realize that this coincides with the end of susan george's novel adaptations and the beginning of made for tv 'based ons'. this is interesting because usually it works the other way round. the prime reason for the improvement i feel is the diminishing role of class conflict in the relationship between lynley and havers once the stories move away from the books. i feel this was a weakness from the start.  class conflict in british society does not work the way the tv shows depict it. it is not overt but oblique. a glass ceiling. havers might bitch to a colleague in a pub about her boss' high handed ways but never to his face. the supposed conflict isn't helped by the fact that  lynley actually is a pretty nice guy, he doesn't flaunt his lordly ways at all which makes her protestations seem somewhat dumb. another weakness in havers' character is her insubordination.  it defies belief. no officer would last five minutes talking to his/ her superior the way she does. plus she routinely disobeys orders but never seems to get punished for it. it is not a credible characterization. this is all down to authorial desperation- the need to create a superabundance of conflict in the belief it will make the relationship more interesting. more is less.  it would have worked better to dump both the class angle (and sharon small's rather cheesy london accent) and the insubordination angle, which in any case has been worked to death in other similar shows, and have the two of them express their differences in the way they think the cases should be investigated. add in the gender difference- he could be a little crusty, she could be more women's lib- and you have more than enough character conflict. the rest is down to plot and acting. they are both very good actors. the plots are adequate tho there are a good few 'i don't believe that!' moments (where poor screenwriting takes liberties to make the plot 'fit') . the production values of the show are excellent.",1280620800,,2096,4.6567567567567565
8139553,5,B000HEWH0A,"It is a crying shame that what I truly believe is the finest show on television may not be going forward unless the campaign being waged by fans of PBS's ""Mystery"" to persuade the BBC to keep producing it is successful. Nathaniel Parker's Inspector Thomas Lynley and Sharon Small's Barbara Havers are certainly the finest duo to come along in ages.

The Inspector Lynley series is smart and atmospheric, Debbie Wiseman's opening music setting the tone for each intriguing installment. Based on Elizabeth George's characters, the BBC show has grown and matured beyond the books, which has frustrated some yet delighted others. The dashing Lynley was originally paired with Havers because it was taken for granted he would not be distracted by her in a romantic way. He was Oxford and she was from the other side of life.

The clashes that came in the first two seasons due to those differences became less important as the two quickly found there was more to each other than their reputations. They proved a great team and became quite close, their deep friendship and affection for each other rarely dwelled upon but always there beneath the surface. By season three when personal crisis hit both of them hard it was each other to which they clung.

Havers has softened some over time and Lynley has become more accessible, both due to the influence of the other. Parker and Small are fabulous in their roles, giving carefully nuanced performances in mysteries both intelligent and entertaining. If not for PBS and its ""Mystery"" this marvelous British series might not have garnered so many fans.

Those wanting to either catch up with what has transpired before season five, or just enjoy once again at their leisure this fine mystery series will be well-advised to get this set. It includes all those episodes from the first four seasons as shown on PBS in America. Those episodes are as follows:

SEASON ONE /  Well-Schooled in Murder --- Payment in Blood --- For the Sake of Elena --- Missing Joseph  SEASON TWO /  Playing for the Ashes --- In the Presence of the Enemy --- A Suitable Vengeance --- Deception on His Mind  SEASON THREE /  In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner --- A Traitor to Memory --- A Cry for Justice --- If Wishes Were Horses  SEASON FOUR /  In Divine Proportion --- In the Guise of Death --- The Seed of Cunning --- The Word of God

Fans of quality television and especially mystery lovers will find a bonanza in these 16 installments starring Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small as Lynley and Havers. Fans truly cherish this show as much as Lynley does his cars. Hopefully we have not seen the last of our favorite British detectives and can once again look forward to ""Mystery"" knowing at some point we can enjoy their company once again.",1214092800,4,2759,4.722916666666666
8139554,4,B000HEWH0A,"We started watching this series on television well after it had begun, so we missed the first four series.  It's a very enjoyable mystery program, and it has been good to watch it from the beginning whenever we want.  Being a British show, sometimes it's hard to understand the dialect, but we can rewind and relisten, or even watch an entire show again to catch all of the subtle nuances which abound in addition to clarifying some words.  I bought this for my husband's birthday because I knew he was a fan, and we have enjoyed every show.  I would have given it five stars except for the fact that we could find no closed captioning availibility that would help clarify some British mumbling.  Great set! Can't wait to buy 5 and 6.",1202688000,,734,4.488721804511278
8139555,5,B000HEWH0A,A very enjoyable series of well written and performed British mysteries (by an American writer) that engages AND holds the viewers mind from the first call to the solution of the case.,1193702400,,184,4.78125
8139556,4,B000HEWH0A,"Major elements in this series are uneven; this may stem from the books, the series or both. The strength in this series lies in the relationships and resulting dialog. The two main characters evolve from stiff Brit and psycho cop into real people who are admirable, likeable, identifiable. (Ironically, the relationship that's supposed to be the strongest, that of Inspector Lynley and the cadaverous Helen (ref: series 1 & 2), rings very false. And that romance lurches along between episodes.) But the relationship between Lynley and Havers suffers a major setback when a conflict is imposed (ref. series 3). Now, conflict could evolve their relationship further, but this one puts the competent Havers ""in her place"" (socially, gender-wise) - totally contrived. Instead of reinforcing that relationships between men and women can have sexual awareness yet still have a strong platonic bond, the outcome is non-sequitor, sad and just plain uncomfortable. Beyond that, the plots sometimes are good and sometimes have major holes. It comes across that this series was developed by different people at different times. But the dialogue and scenery make the series a nice escape after a long work day.",1191110400,,1199,5.25
8139557,3,B000HEWH0A,"As a fan of the Elizabeth George novels, I was impressed by the initial quality of the series. As the series moved beyond the novels, the plots became  irritatingly predictable.  George had the sense to expand the narrowness of a two character lead by adding four other central characters.  We are left with Helen, interpreted as so neurotic that one wonders why anyone would spend more than ten minutes with her.",1189123200,,413,4.788732394366197
8139558,5,B000HEWH0A,"What a great way to spend hot summer evenings, in front of the tv watching good mysteries with great acting and plot lines.  Fantastic to watch the character development between Lynley and Havers.  The English scenery shots are fantastic, almost feel like I am there.",1185408000,2,267,4.911111111111111
