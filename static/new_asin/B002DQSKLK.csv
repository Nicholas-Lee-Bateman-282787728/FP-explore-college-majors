WHAT'S MISSING:  Although I'm a big fan, I'm not a completist, so to be honest, I'm not sure.  Most notably, I think his HBO special ""Banned"" is missing, and I'm not sure whether this set has all the extras from the other dvds or not.  I'll leave that to the other hardcore fans to fill in.

I do know that at $7.87 plus shipping, it's far and away the best Kinison value currently on Amazon.",1262217600,17,1072,5.045714285714285
3912594,5,B002DQSKLK,"While i've seen most of the shows on this package there were a couple of really nice surprises. I had never seen the Las Vegas show,so that was a huge bonus,plus the extra material in New Jersey at Rascals were awesome as well. The Tribute section was basically his best routines from his best shows put all together with some added commentary from his brother Bill and Rodney Dangerfield at the beginning. Still great stuff. If your not familiar with his work this would be a perfect introduction as it is almost a complete compilation of his work. And at the prices i'm finding for online it's a downright steal. Over 6 hrs. of Sam!!! Hard to believe but true. Most fans of Sam would probably already have most of this material,but diehards will want it for the Rascals alone. Hard to believe he's been gone for so long....Sam,you are missed.",1255132800,32,844,4.596026490066225

3912608,5,B002DQSKLK,"Sam Kinison was the original crazy comedian.  He yelled at the audience as though they were merely buddies sharing a wild, drunken party with him.  This disc contains his great routines ""Breaking All The Rules"" (1987); ""Outlaws of Comedy"" (1990); ""Family Entertainment Hour"" (1991) -- and it's definitely NOT family material! -; ""Sam Kinison Live in Las Vegas"" (1991), and ""Brother Sam: A Tribute"" (1993.)  He loves to talk about sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll, so leave the kids with a sitter!  It's the perfect DVD for a snowy weekend trapped at home when your kids are staying with friends.  OR, if you WERE a little kid during his TV performances and were not allowed to see this, you are now old enough!  Enjoy!  There is also dress rehearsal footage, just as funny, and a photo slide show.  His comedy is bawdy, mostly timeless, and was way ahead of his time.  Take a chance and go over to the wild side with ""Wild Child.""  You'll like it!",1388620800,,943,4.559523809523809
3912609,5,B002DQSKLK,"I bought this because I remembered Kinison from years ago. I actually forgotten how foul he could get. If you're offended easily, you may not like Sam's style. An Ex-Preacher, turned comedian. It's too bad he didn't live longer. If your open-minded, then I think you'll want to check this out!",1381190400,2,293,4.764705882352941
3912610,1,B002DQSKLK,"I ordered this because of the great price.  I love his ""World Hinger"" bit and figured that the rest of his comedy would be in keeping with that.  I watched the first show on this dvd and it's just not for me.  I didn't find it funny at all and I don't think you need to be a prude to not appreciate this type of humor.  Sam Kinison was a very funny guy but his main line of humor is just way over the edge  for me.",1379462400,,414,3.7126436781609193
3912611,5,B002DQSKLK,This dvd brings together performances from different times with Sam K.  I think that he was always funny.  You know that he wanted to get straight.  It bothered him.  He was on a comebak path....,1374451200,,195,4.485714285714286
3912612,3,B002DQSKLK,"There are two discs to this set - the first one was great, the second not so much; it was a disappointment.  Filmed in the years immediately before his death, his delivery was sporadic, nothing made sense, and he tended to focus on obscenities
rather than content.  Number 1 disc is older and more of what we expected of Sam Kinison.",1372291200,3,333,4.442622950819672
3912613,5,B002DQSKLK,"For Sam Kinison fans--as well as fans of aggressive-angry-insulting comedians from Don Rickles to the Comedy Central Roasters to Howard Stern--this nearly complete 2-DVD set is definitely worth the inexpensive price. Covering Sam's too-brief career from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, it contains Sam's first HBO special 1987's ""Breaking The Rules"" and 1991's ""Family Entertainment Hour"", both of which are great shows.  It also contains 1990's ""Outlaws of Comedy"" and 1991's ""Live In Las Vegas"", the latter of which is mostly redundant in terms of comedy material.  My only real complaint is that Sam's breakthrough performance from the 1985 HBO ""9th Annual Young Comedian's Special"", hosted by Rodney Dangerfield, appears on the 2nd DVD ""Brother Sam: A Tribute to Sam Kinison"" in a poor quality, edited video clip.  Truth be told, I prefer Sam's earlier work from the 1980s when he was still a hungry comedian on the rise, more than his later work in 1990-92 when he was already famous and adopted his ""Rock-N-Roll"" comedian persona.

The most glaring omission from this 2-DVD set is ""Banned"", which was recorded in 1990 as Sam's second HBO special, but was not aired on HBO.  ""Banned"" is difficult to find on DVD and contains all three of Sam's music videos--cover versions of the Trogg's ""Wild Thing"" with Jessica Hahn and various 1980s heavy metal stars; the Rolling Stones' ""Under My Thumb"" with Ozzy Osbourne and David Faustino #aka Bud Bundy#; and Mountain's ""Mississippi Queen"".  I suppose a completely comprehensive DVD set of Sam's comedy career would also require video from his appearances on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and Late Nite with David Letterman, his two appearances on Saturday Night Live, his cameo role as the history professor in Rodney Dangerfield's film ""Back To School"",  and his role as Al Bundy's guardian angel in the two-part ""Married...With Children"" Christmas episodes.",1371945600,2,1916,5.161290322580645

3912616,4,B002DQSKLK,This DVD was a good buy for me. My boyfriend loved Sam Kinisons crazy standup and the DVD did not let down. We shared some good laughs watching his comedy.,1357689600,,155,4.2
3912617,3,B002DQSKLK,"I remember when Sam Kinison first became one of the most popular comics around during the 80s. His comedy was funny at first, but over time he seemed to buy into his own hype and somewhat lost his way. Too bad he died in such a senseless way.",1342828800,,242,4.0625
3912618,3,B002DQSKLK,We ordered this disc with great hope.  Only one of the segments appears to be professionally done.  Does not include some of his great early work.  Somewhat disappointed.,1325635200,,170,5.0
3912619,1,B002DQSKLK,We though Sam was funny when he first began his career.  But these are NOT funny.  Just hate against everyone and everything.

If you like to laugh and can laugh at yourself cause your not easily offended please consider this DVD package.  If you've ever had your heart broken by someone (male of female - a cheater is a cheater) then you'll laugh your butt off.

If you are familiar with him, then this will likely be a favorite of yours, as it has come to be for me.  If you are new to him, you should know that this guy was known for nasty, put it in your face humor about sex:  having sex, giving sex, sex in marriage, sex, sex, sex.  This would probably be rated X for language.  He does not beat around the bush!  If you are easily offended, this would not be for you.  But, if you like this type of humor, you will always be laughing.  I saw him in person, in Atlanta, at the Fox Theatre, before he was killed in a vehicle wreck, while on his way to a gig.  Sam's timing is impecable and his words are carefully chosen to deliver a great laugh.  This man rolled with traveling preachers in his humble beginning which gave him a great start getting and keeping the attention of his audiences.  At the end of his life, he also rolled with heavy metal bands.  And, in this performance, Sam shows that he can also play guitar with them.  He is also known for making fun of marriage and the women who gave him heartache.  He tells about life as we know it...at any age...at any decade of time, his remarks are relavent.  Since he is gone, this is the best way to remember him.  Rock on.",1299110400,2,1386,4.6460905349794235
3912622,3,B002DQSKLK,"The dvd arrived in a broken case with both dvds rattling around loosely together. They arrived with lots of scratches, and I fully intended on returning them, but thought I'd see if they worked first. I haven't watched the whole thing, but the little I did watch seemed to be working. I put them in a new case and decided to keep them.  There is a lot to watch on each dvd, and the picture quality is good for how old the footage is. Overall it's a great product, they just need to add a little more protection to the package before it ships.",1294876800,,542,4.211538461538462
3912623,4,B002DQSKLK,"Once again...........Sam was perhaps the funniest, most striking comedic character of the past fifty years. His comedy was timely, visceral and most importantly, very human. Most of what parades about today as ""humor"" is boring, sophomoric and generally very predictable. Sam wasn't boring, wasn't sophomoric and early on wasn't very predictable.",1294617600,,346,5.803921568627451
3912624,2,B002DQSKLK,"I love Kinison, but only glimpses of his brilliance are afforded in this 2-CD set. This is mostly latter career big stage rock and roll and cursing crudeness, not the dazzling originality and brilliance he exhibited early on in clubs. There is far too much of same material, different day here as well, with many versions of the same (and certainly not his funniest) routines over and over again.",1293494400,6,396,4.753623188405797

8365959,5,B002DQSKLK,"Sam Kinison is my favorite comedian of all time. This 2-DVD set is a great deal, especially if you don't want to shell out for the new box set. Wild Child contains
Breaking The Rules - HBO special from 1987
Family Entertainment Hour - HBO special from 1991
Outlaws of Comedy - 1990 performance released posthumously
Live in Las Vegas - 1991 performance released posthumously
Brother Sam - A compilation of clips, interviews, and tv footage that originally aired on the Playboy Channel
plus there's a bonus performance from 1987 at Rascals.

The Rascals show is worth the price alone. An unreleased performance from Sam at his peak? Hell yeah! (and its not on the box set either). He's testing out some of the material that would end up on Have You Seen Me Lately. Absolute must have for any Sam fan.
The other stuff has been released before but this is a great way to get it all at once for cheap.",1480723200,2,897,4.5030674846625764
