8531815,5,B008XAT12M,"Father Hood is one of the late and yes great Patrick Swayze's most underrated movies. Swayze (R.I.P.) never got the credit he deserved as an actor. Sure he had bombs but what actor hasn't? This is one of his best performances and movies. Father Hood is highly entertaining, funny, exciting and touching. I highly recommend it especially if you are a fan of Patrick Swayze in the least bit. The blu ray quality is very good. Just wish it was by itself instead of a double feature.",1473206400,,479,4.517241379310345

8531817,3,B008XAT12M,"Im a fan of the fox man, but this one was a swing and a miss for me.  I think it was the casting to blame more than the story.  there was no chemistry between the actors and it showed in there performances.  plus there were time they could have went for more laughs but held back to keep the movie sappy and kid friendly.",1436400000,,321,3.9076923076923076

Both were not bad. Patrick Swayze did a great job.",1361059200,,117,4.130434782608695
8531819,3,B008XAT12M,Got the movie because my husband and I both like Michael J. Fox and Patrick Swayze.  In our opinion Fatherhood was much better than we expected and Life with Mikey did not meet our expectations.,1356393600,,194,4.542857142857143
8531820,5,B008XAT12M,"This two-fer blu-ray from Mill Creek is two family flims.

Father Hood starring the late Patrick Swayze (Road House,Ghost) is PG-13, so I might not be suitable for younger viewers.
Halle Berry (Monsters Ball) , and Michael Ironside (Scanners) co-star.

Life With Mikey starring Michael J Fox (Back To The Future Trilogy/Spin City) is PG.
singer Cyndi Lauper, Nathan Lane (The Birdcage), and David Huddleston (Blazing Saddles/The Big Lebowski) co-star

Me and my nephews enjoyed both of the films.

The PQ and AQ on both of these look great IMO, both  are in anamorphic widescreen.

There are no special features on the discs, just the films, but still this disc is a great bargain for the price!

Great job Mill Creek!",1353974400,4,718,4.884297520661157
