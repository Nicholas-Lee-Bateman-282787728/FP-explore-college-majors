8005282,2,B00011ZBV6,"I really had big expectations going into this series.  Reading the other reviews on here I thought that I was in for something fanstastic, but my expectations were not met.

Crying Freeman starts off with a lot of promise.  There's a mysterious charachter, a love connection, and then a destiny met-- all things that give the series a strong foundation.  After the initial introduction to the story and main charachters, the series falls apart.  Enter killing after killing, mission after mission that seem to lead to absolutely nowhere, sensless nudity, and you get an absolutely rediculous and humerous plot.

Before I watched this series, one thing that a reviewer said stuck into my mind ""the charachters seem to drop their clothes for no reason."" Boy was he right.  The amount of nudity in this series gets so over the top that you have to wonder why it was put in.  Weere the producers looking for a crime-drama or were they looking for a hentai(anime porn)?  The amount of times that the charachters just casually take their clothes off makes one wonder.

The sketching?  hmmm, Crying Freeman is an early 90's anime so you can't expect it to have the level of excellence of today, but some of the charachter sketches are very amatueristic.  There is one scene in particular that will make you laugh.. It's a certain decapitation scene in the latter part of this movie--look out for how the blood spurts lol.

All in all, Crying Freeman has too many flaws.  There is no build up of the charachter Freeman.  In the beginning of the movie, he talks about leaving Japan and moving on with his wife, yet, as the story progresses he remains a brute killer.  Also, where exactly does his story lead to?  The only thing that occurs in this movie is a bunch of run ins with rivals and a bunch of deaths.  Where is the progression of the charachters and their lives?  There's none.  Despite it's shortcommings, Crying Freeman is a VERY entertaining anime.  The death scenes are artsy and flashy, and the women (yes, I actually got turned on by these anime women--hard to believe) and sex scenes that they're involved in are pretty steamy.

I'd say to give this one a shot.  Don't go in expecting some Godfather bit, though.  Just approach it with an open mind and heart.",1147305600,,2267,4.666666666666667
8005283,3,B00011ZBV6,"Warning: this anime is not for kids!

Crying Freeman is a an anime series about the chinese mafia and the rise of their best assassin named, Yoh. Yoh once used to be an artist but was later forced into the mafia called ""108 Dragons"" because he had discovered evidence of a murder in a photograph that he accidently obtained. He was kidnapped, brain-washed and forced into training to become one of their best assassins. Yoh is deadly in every way possible, he is proficient in martial arts can kill almost anyone barehanded. When armed with pistols and daggers he is almost unstoppable. His specialty is the dagger which he uses to stab his targets through their heads!. A woman named, Hino witnesses a killing by Yoh. So the ""108 Dragons"" mafia order, Yoh to kill, Hino because she is a witness for the police. But instead of killing the woman, Yoh falls in love with her and their lives change forever. The series has an epic feel to it as you watch the many events and rivalries. They fight against the Yukuza, Russian mafia and merceneries. Crying Freeman is very bloody, violent and a bit sexually perverted. The body count is high as gangsters get stabbed, shot and blown up in explosions. Women are also part of the violence either committing it or being victims themselves; murders, kidnapping and rapes. There is also a lot of senseless nudity, because many characters will fight naked! They got naked 60% of the time sometimes without good reason. This made no sense to me at all. The creators also were obssessed with tattoos as many characters in this show have them. The artwork was not like the typical anime we enjoy, it had more of an americanized look to it (like a G.I. Joe) cartoon. The animation was not that great either but remember that this is an old school anime. What makes the series good is the intense action; it really felt like you were watching the life of the mafia members. I enjoyed the story overall for the most part except for the minor complaints mentioned above. The Enlish dub was done well too. Crying Freeman has six episodes and the series ends on episode 6. For adults only.",1125446400,,2119,4.605820105820106
8005284,5,B00011ZBV6,"I have all the volumes and love each one although the last two aren't as good as the first. The episodes start repeating themselves after a while. In the first, Freeman's origin of how he is turned into an assassin against his will is revealed and he cries each time he kills somebody as a release to his true self. He is sent to kill a woman but she doesn't want to die a virgin so she asks that he have sex with her before he kills her. Being the nice guy that he is, he agrees. He says he's also a virgin. I think he was lying. This guy has sex with pretty much every woman he meets in this series. He didn't start having sex until he met this woman in the first episode? I don't believe it. Anyway, he falls in love with her and marries her. The rest of the episodes go something like this: somebody or some group wants to kill Freeman and take over the 108 Dragons and Freeman stops them. That's pretty much it. Oh yea, plenty of killing, nudity and sex is thrown in. Some lovable characters are thrown in and some die sadly but it's all good. For me, the only let down is Freeman never becomes free. At the end of the series he is still a killer. I was expecting a breakthrough. His soul is obviously being tortured since he cries after he kills. I would have liked to see him break away from that life. But oh well. I still love it. It's a classic",1072569600,5,1354,4.074906367041199
8005285,5,B00011ZBV6,"Crying Freeman is a true work of art ahead of its time.  Viewing this great anime is candy for the anime lover's eye.  Kazuo Koike and Ryoichi Ikegami wrote the magna that turned into a smash hit.  The plot is revolves around an assassin from the Chinese Mafia.  Originally, an acclaimed pottery designer, Yoh Hinamura is drawn into a crime ring when he finds film that contains photographs of a murder.  Brainwashed to be a killer he murders people and after every person, he kills, he weeps.
  When a woman by the name of Emu Hino (age 29 and a virgin) witnesses a murder.  They briefly and awkwardly talk for a moment before Yoh flees.  Afterward she fears for her life.
When the Chinese Mafia, a drug and arms dealing business, expands into Japan police and a Japanese gang with a following of 26,000 members team up to stop the Mafia.  In the first episode ""Portrait of a Killer"" Freeman, setting the plot into motion, assassinates the leader of the Japan gang.  At that crime, by chance Freeman runs past Yoh.  Their eyes never meet but she knows it was him.

  When Freeman goes to assassinate Emu, she tells him that she knows she will be killed.  Her final request is that she does not die a virgin.  (Over protective late father kept her from experiencing love).  She tells that she is a virgin to Yoh and he states that he is also a virgin.  They have sex, revealing Yoh's intricate dragon tattoos.  Both experiencing love for the first time, they start to car for each other and speeding up the process, she is shot in a scuffle immediately after they have sex.  He rushes her to the hospital.  Knowing that she will never be safe, he takes her in.

  This anime is not for children or young teens for that matter.  Crying Freeman has a mix of mild language with a large amount of upper nudity and several sexual orientations.  All of this is heavily coated with pools of blood.  This is a graphic anime but as stated earlier, this is geared toward a mature audience.
  Recap: Beautiful anime that pushed the boundaries of acceptable anime when released in 1986.  Till this day, Crying Freeman is still a crowd please.  I loved it.  If you are looking an anime with class but still contains a sexual and action packed adventure then you have found the right anime.  Five Stars!",1071705600,6,2289,4.5024390243902435
