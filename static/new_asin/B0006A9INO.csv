8040952,2,B0006A9INO,"SEAWOLF THE PIRATE'S CURSE is lame, ponderous, and dull.  Any attempts at humor fall extremely flat, and the whole movie is limp and flaccid.  Thomas Ian Griffith (Final Encounter, Excessive Force) is one of the most bland heroes we've seen in some time.  Attempting to be a new Harrison Ford, Griffith only serves to remind us how great Indiana Jones was, and how any movie claiming to be ""like"" it always fall flat.  Add Gerit Kling, a lovely German actress, whose accident is almost indecipherable, Barry Flatman who lives up to his last name in his role as a villainous colonel, and assorted chases and you have one cheesy movie.  The heroes actually use a coral colored Volkswagen as their getaway car; the bad guys pursue an old Chevy Impala in Suzukis!!! There is little to recommend the film except for some lovely scenery of Cuba.

A real dud; 2 stars for the landscapes.",1102636800,2,880,4.681818181818182
