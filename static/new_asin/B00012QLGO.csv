His TV series, Mail Call, airs on the History Channel so some people may not have ever seen it.  Basically, Ermey gets questions from viewers dealing with military issues, such as how various weapons and equipment work, what gear soldiers carry, what they eat in the field, etc...
Ermey goes on to not only answer, but often demonstrate the equipment.  Everything from the most modern day tanks, to swords, crossbows, and armor.
Ermey demonstrated the full plate armor, used by knights in the middle ages, and how they fought in all that weight.
Even people who may not be military enthusiasts will like the show due to Ermeys tough, but good-natured personality.  Even my wife likes it and finds it quite interesting.
The DVD is a good place to start if for some reason you don't have access to the History Channel.",1075161600,5,1054,4.6702702702702705

8005744,5,B00012QLGO,"I enjoy this thoroughly, as do my sons. We watch it together, and as a dad I use it as a learning tool for them to see both what our men and women in uniform were using at the time the video was made, but also what was used, back in the days gone by. R. Lee Ermey is, IMO, one of the funniest, gung ho people I have ever had the pleasure of watching.

I recommend this, absolutely.

Note: For the overly sensitive (or those who may be watching this with VERY small children), the Gunny occasionally uses terms like ""big assed,"" ""helluva"" and the like.",1395187200,,551,4.140186915887851

8005747,5,B00012QLGO,"As a fan of this show, I really like the DVD of the second season of Mail Call. It highlights the best episodes of the second season and I thought that it was really cool about how Gunny explains the various military hardware and tactics and the way that he does it is phenominal.
I highly recommend this DVD to history and military buffs.",1077580800,2,339,4.3125
