8761865,5,B01FZ8ZWTU,"An excellent title finally released from the death grip of Disney.  This US license for this title had been held in the back rooms of Disney for a long while and finally has a release (on BluRay too!) thanks to ""Maiden Japan"".  Fun how in this show they had been warning children not to run into streets chasing cyber things in the glasses, which seems a good prediction of what some people did with Pokemon Go.",1482796800,,411,4.394736842105263
