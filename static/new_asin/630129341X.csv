323032,3,630129341X,"Whoever earlier compared this movie favorable to The Lady Eve, Sullivan's Travels, Jerry Maquire, As Good as it Gets and Bringing up Baby must (as James Earl Jones said in Field of Dreams) be seeing a whole team of psychiatrists.  It's an awful piece of mediocrity from a period when Travolta seemed incapable of picking good material (sort of like this year).  However --
that being said, you MUST see this movie if only for the fact that, believe it or not, Travolta's hottest dance sequence in any movie is here.  How did it end up here?  Who knows?  But from the moment Kelly Preston slinks onto the dance floor and rivets his attention, and for about three all-too-short minutes afterwards, The Experts takes its place in the pantheon of Bad Movies with Unforgettable Scenes.  I actually watched this on a local commercial station one night a few years ago, and the number was cut by almost half because it's so suggestive.  And that's not to say it's just an oglefest of insinuation -- there are some great moves here.
So for however few bucks ..., pick it up and enjoy this unforgettable dance, as long as you understand that the rest of it is pure caca.",976579200,3,1161,4.579710144927536
323033,3,630129341X,When I was going to see this movie I first put it on and said this is funny but it is going to end up dumb. But it actually ended up being a pretty good movie. And I thought that was a newer movie like from the 80s  and I was write but it is not to predictible well at least not as much as  some movies are. i say if you need some fun or cherring up this is your  movie.,955497600,2,370,3.4878048780487805
323034,5,630129341X,"I for one am a huge John Travolta fan.  His secret is in the style of his acting.  He's just like your best friend, you know, just one of the guys.  I'm really glad to see that he is one of the highest paid actors in  Hollywood, because he deserves it. I also enjoy Arye Gross's performance in  this film.  Whatever happened to him anyway?  Arye was particularly good in  HOUSE II(1987).  I've got to say that Travolta and Gross make a good  comedic team.  ABOUT THE FILM:  This film isn't the best film ever made.  It's just one of those films you can stick in the VCR on a Saturday  afternoon and enjoy.  Oh, I've also got to praise Kelley Preston's  performance.  I mean she is just beautiful, and an awesome dancer.  Well, I  shouldn't leave Mr. Travolta out, he is impressive as always.  This film is  just plain fun.  So if you haven't seen it, buy it, you won't regret it.",954460800,2,879,4.263803680981595
323035,5,630129341X,"This video is one that only 1 of my friends have seen, and I made them see it.  They hated it but I LOVED IT.  The best movie of Travolta's career.  Also, if anyone knows the titles to the song off the  ""soundtrack,"" please e-mail me.  I love the music.",954374400,,253,3.98
7810718,5,630129341X,"a prior reviewer stated that there's a great dance scene with travolta and preston. i second the fact that this is probably the most memorable dance scene in any travolta flick: forget saturday night fever or grease... it's here! on the straight to video forgotten eighties b movie! also travolta has a bad eighties mullet and him and arye gross play scenemakers/hipsters from new york city named travis and wendel--also the movie has a super corny soundtrack-check out the cheesy remake of the beatles back in the ussr and the song on the closing credits 'hometown usa' all in all, it's a fun movie and a fun movie to watch and make fun of while you watch it. wardrobe looks like it was furnished by zcavarici. by the way, whatever became of arye gross after he hung up his zCavs?",1324598400,,781,4.585714285714285
7810719,5,630129341X,"This is one of Travolta's best movies there are great reviews of this movie out there so I'll just say come on already give us a DVD already. And Kelly Preston in this movie is so amazingly hot this is the movie that her and john met on her hotness alone is a reason to release these movie on DVD.

Other great films that need to be released

Here's my top 10

1-Big Shots 1987-Darius MaCrary & Ricky Busker An Ivan Reitman Film
2-Hot to Trot 1988-Bobcat Goldthwait & John Candy
3-Second Sight 1989-Bronson Pinchot & John Larroquette

9-Bad Medicine 1985-Steve Guttenberg & Allan Arkin
10-The Taking of Beverly Hills 1991-Ken Wahl

Also deserving a mention for a DVD release is The Invisible Kid 1988 Jay Underwood. But i got this one from amazon.co.uk as they have great titles not released in North America such as Though Guys 1986 starring Kirk Douglas & Dana Carvey,Rude Awakening 1989 starring Eric Roberts & Cheech Marin and Run 1991 starring Patrick Dempsey & Kelly Preston.

These movies should also be on DVD here in North America not just in the U.K.",1266537600,,1296,4.846153846153846

7810721,3,630129341X,"harmless fun -- john travolta and his wife - before she was his wife - kelly preston - in this fun flick where we get to explore life the ""way it should have been"" growing up.  send two NY to the middle of Nebraska and they find they are living in the 50's before pleasantville ever thought of being a story!  (but are they REALLY in Nebraska in the '50's...?",1229126400,,359,4.114285714285714
7810722,5,630129341X,"I love this movie and have been waiting for years for it to come out on DVD. I'm not like some other posers who are armchair critics (or wish they were) and wanna-be directors who cut down movies for one stupid reason or another. I analyze a movie on how it makes me feel, and how it makes me laugh. This one does deserve 5 stars and I think it's one of Travolta's better roles, at least from the 80's. I liked it as much as Two of a kind. My favorite part was the Russian pilot that just couldn't get American slang correct. Cracks me up every time I see it.",1152921600,8,559,4.0
7810723,5,630129341X,"i f'n WISH this movie would come out on DVD already!  travolta with his 80's ass mullet and gross just screams queer.  also see Soul Man for more gross lameness!  but wow, this movie is a classic!  the outfits are horrible...more pleated pants and acid wash and all that other ""hip 1986 new york 'style'"" than u can shake a stick at.  someone talked about the dance scene..i mean that was more or less softcore porn.  thats the kinda thing u might see on skinimax or red shoe diaries and they have the balls to just throw it right in this middle of this fun action adventure and lets not forget...comedy!  i cant say enough how much this move rocks...its truly hilarious,,and PLEASE put it out on dvd already..ill even buy 2 copies!  one to watch and one to wipe my ass with",1126224000,2,774,4.363636363636363

7810725,4,630129341X,"I grew up during the Cold War -- in the Soviet Union and immigrated to the U.S. in the 1980s, so this movie for me has a whole different context. I like the premise: take two unsuspecting Americans to Russia and tell them they are in Nebraska. Quite a dig at Nebraska, wouldn't you say? And the 80's hair styles, are they not totally ridiculous?
This movie has wit and humor, although it may not be quite the laugh out loud movie that one may first expect. Still I highly recommend it. Preston is very sexy, especially with her dance moves. And the Russians are portrayed as cute and simplistically noble in this film. The Cold War is over, but the movie is still entertaining.",1070323200,6,677,4.424

TOTALLY MORONIC SCRIPT WITH A SENSE OF STUPIDITY BUT YET IT'S FUN TO SEE TRAVOLTA MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF.
