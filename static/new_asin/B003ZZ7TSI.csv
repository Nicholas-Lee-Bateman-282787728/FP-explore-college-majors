8411361,5,B003ZZ7TSI,"Dudu Fisher is AMAZING!  Everyone knows him for his great singing, but few realize he has these fantastic videos for Jewish children.  They are so full of positivity, morality, and fun songs, it is a real shame NOT to have his videos in your house!

In Hebrew, his Sukkot, Shabbat, High Holidays, and Jerusalem DVDs are my favorites - my daughter (who is now 3) has been watching them since she was about 18 months.  She has learned a lot of Hebrew and Jewish traditional themes through Dudu's work.  Wonderful, wonderful!",1287273600,,522,4.6923076923076925
