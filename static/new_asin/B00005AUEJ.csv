Everyone thinks it (...is bad...). You have to remember, these guys have not been in the wrestling bussiness all that long. The reason I gave it 5 stars was to bump up its average rating , cause some guys are giving it 1 or 2 stars.
If you get this video get the first Baptized in Blood with it.
After you get those videos you will probably be hooked.",1006819200,,414,4.060975609756097
7936025,1,B00005AUEJ,"I am I hardcore wrestling fan. I've watched ECW since 94 until it closed and I am a big fan of FMW wrestling. I bought this video because I knew how hardcore XPW was from their website lookin at pictures and what not. and I finally bought it and I was really disapointed and here is my ratings for every match with 5 bein the best and some thoughts.
- we start off with Kriss Kloss introducing porno stars, tripods, and the most hardcore wrestling ever (yeah right) we get a pretty cheap video package that looks pretty kewl. we meet XPW's jobber Jimmy the homeless guy roaming the streets eatin dog food and spittin on peeeps windows and washin it with a rag. pretty stupid. then Supreme cuts a disturbing promo cuttin up pig and playin with it. no im not joking!
Match 1: Supreme vs. Jimmy The Homeless Guy - man does kriss kloss's commentary suck! anyways not a terrible match here. coolest part of the match we see a top rope toad splash through a table on the outside. too short and not that hardcore! Supreme does a wussy bladjob here amd that about cuts it RATING: **1/2
we next meet ChroniK and the wets side NGZ weaking havoc in XPW and we see the Pitbulls come out and we have a impromptou match but we cut to ""to be continued""!!!!!!! wtf!!! i have yet to see the conclusion to that to this very day!!
Match 2: White Trash Johnny Webb vs. Dynamite D - okish match here. Webb is a good wrestler and D just a steve corino wannabe!! match ends up a brawl in the end.
RATING: **
we meet Damien Steele walkin in resturants and into fine stores acting like he is good or something
Match 3: Cage Match: Damien Steele vs. Big Dick - best match on the card here and it's pretty bad and the worst part of it is Nicole Bass appears here!!!!!!! ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! RATING: **1/2
Bottom Line: save ure money",993600000,2,1804,4.3088235294117645
7936026,2,B00005AUEJ,"I initially got this tape when it first came out, and I have to say its totally horrible!  I would recommend a few of the other XPW and or ECW releases but not this one, the matches are filmed in scuzbag bars and clubs, and the talent isn't much better, the production is crappy and the announcer makes Mark Madden look good.  Worse yet theres like a 15 minute stripsow at the end don't get me wrong I like Jasmine St. Claire and all but she did nothing remotely ""Extreme or Hardcore"", this video is for the birds.......its true its damn true",986601600,,542,4.303921568627451
7936027,4,B00005AUEJ,"This video was my first exposure to XPW. But there other videos are better. Like ""Go Funk Yourself"" and ""Baptized In Blood"".",986169600,,124,4.681818181818182
7936028,5,B00005AUEJ,"This was my first exposure to XPW & I enjoyed it. It told you a bit about the characters, gave ya lots of background information, & would be great for the first time XPW fan.",985564800,,174,4.0
