8599833,1,B00E0MKEXM,"This is more or less a collection of movies recorded  DVDs and collated in a poor cartoon box! This the kind of movies you find in grocery stores where you can buy anything for 1$.
The description is mismatched and there is no special packaging. The DVD boxes are of poor quality. All in all, shame on you Amazon for selling this with such a misleading description and with such a price!",1379894400,,387,4.375
8599834,3,B00E0MKEXM,"This is not a specially packaged set.  My order consists of 9 separate multi-title sets - each in its own individual box.  There are no real classics and you probably won't watch any of them more than once (except maybe the Jackie Chan set and Into The West).  The sets I received are as follows, with the number of titles in each set.
 4 Pokemon Collector's set - animated films
 4 Dead Man (Johnny Depp)/Equilibrium/Renaissance/Texas Rangers
 3 House Party: Don't Be A Menace.../Get Over It!/Outside Providence (Alec Baldwin)
 8 Jackie Chan Collection
11 The Prophecy & Hellraiser films (but not the original Hellraiser)
 4 Full Frontal(Julia Roberts)/Playing By Heart(Angelina Jolie)/Four Rooms (Madonna)/Beautiful Girls (Natalie Portman)
 4 Into The West/Neverending Story III/A Wrinkle In Time/King Wind
 6 Haunted Spirits (titles unfamiliar to me except Night Listener (Robin Williams)
 4 Becoming Jane (Anne Hathaway)/Jane Eyre(1995)/Basquiat/St. Ives
This totals 48 films - am I missing 1 set or is this false advertising?",1379548800,2,1030,5.415094339622642
