The trouble is the stage lighting at this recording is uneven in the main spot light - overly bright in the center, less elsewhere.

They probably have post processed the footage to make it a bit brighter to see details in the shadow areas - which results in the footage having no real blacks and only dark grays and the center of the spot light over-exposed/washed out
- so it just does not look that good -

If I were being unkind - I would have said this was no better than an audience video..... but it obviously is not, because the camera skills and editing are actually very good being at the right place at the right moment - so one can see what is being played and Hiromi's expressions.

The fact that Hiromi is wearing a red dress and a lot of the lighting in the scene seem to be on the blue side does not help either.

I have a DVD torrent downloaded of her performance at Marciac, France just 16 days earlier, and that French HDTV broadcast quality is stunningly good - her performance there I considered one of the best I have ever seen live or otherwise.

So 16 days later at the Blue Note, New York - her now home turf - how did she do?

Well, all I can say is to repeat the word stunning -
her performance is almost unbelievably good.
If I didn't see it for myself - even on the so-so video quality - I would not believe it (OK I do, because I have watched the Marciac DVD performance over and over again).

Even though she did some of the same tunes at Marciac - the performances here are different, she plays the songs differently in places - shows this is real jazz.

Her other two DVDs with her Trio and Sonicbloom have much better video quality - they are also very good performances -

But this solo at the Blue Note is something else - if one can get over the so-so video quality - don't get me wrong it is not bad - but it could have been much, much better.

The same cannot be accused about the music - it is hard to imagine anything much better.

Hiromi herself is the producer - so she must have picked the selection and over two days to have the pick of her favorite performances has got to be something.  I suspect however the selection may have been from one day only, as her red dress is unchanging.......

Outstanding performance (wish I was there) - only so-so video quality.

Pity it could have been perfect, with a little more care in the lighting.

4 stars only because of the video image quality -
otherwise 6 stars for the performance!

EDIT to ADD - the bonus special feature is very worthwhile - it is a kind of blog of Hiromi's travels and concerts all over the world, and some descriptions of her tunes.  She speaks in Japanese so need to turn on the English subtitles - surprisingly her voice when speaking Japanese is deeper than when she speaks English (which is charmingly squeaky).

I was surprised that Amazon did not include the track listing of this DVD -
I have uploaded a scan of the back cover as well as a crop of the track listing -

1. BQE
2. Sicilian Blue
3. Choux a la Creme
4. Green Tea Farm
5. Capecod Chips
6. Old Castle, by the River, in the Middle of a Forest
7. Pachelbel's Canon
Viva! Vegas
{8. Show City, Show Girl
{9. Daytime in Las Vegas
{10. The Gambler
11. Place to be (encore)

12. Special Feature.

MORE THOUGHTS -

My comments about the video quality should not put anyone off buying this DVD - it is along with Hiromi Live Jazz at Marciac - some of the finest performances I have ever seen - bar none.

I have now had this DVD for about a month - I play it a lot - most of the time I play it like an audio CD (ie: don't pay much attention to the video part) but every so often I'll want to know what Hiromi is doing, and am compelled to watch - and am not disappointed in what I see - in other words this is proof the camera work/angles are very good showing her performance.

I have mentioned her performance live in Jazz at Marciac - this unfortunately is not commercially available - but the PAL DVD video is on the net - it has really good performance and video - it was a French HDTV broadcast - and terrific video quality.

How do they compare, as Hiromi plays some tunes in common and the performances are are a mere 16 days apart - well now that I've lived with both - the performances are different -

Marciac was a Jazz Festival on a big stage - with proper stage lighting and televised, Blue Note is a major/prestigious but small jazz club so more intimate.

In that way the performances were different because Hiromi was playing for different types of audience and setting.

Marciac was more show-y and possibly more immediately accessible - Blue Note was more intense for close scrutiny - BUT the main point is both are/were superb - they complement each other - I am glad I have both.

Just for an example of the Blue Note performance - chapter/track 5 Capecod Chips - at about 47:15 of the DVD she starts her intro to a boogie-woogie/stride section, and starts into full swing at 47:35 - simply unbridled enthusiasm - she was obviously enjoying herself then throws in an embellishment at 48:16 - make one go holy-c*p what was that!

Then listen/watch her tease and laugh with the audience on The Gambler (chapter/track 10) -
this is an extraordinary talent -
mainly listen with one's ears -
and watch for the subtleties/nuances.

Just get the DVD.",1300752000,26,5495,4.274131274131274

8432537,5,B004K7M6VU,"This set is freaking amazing! I had more appreciation for it after watching the special feature, where she explains the origins of the songs. Hiromi, to me, is the most exciting musician in jazz at this point. In this show, she plays amazing piano and also simulates a harpsichord, bass, and I think a roulette wheel or slot machine.

Someone commented that the audience is a little subdued. I found that to be true also. Unfortunately, the sightlines in many jazz clubs are no good for watching a piano keyboard. Perhaps they should have a video screen?",1459900800,,554,4.711340206185567
8432538,5,B004K7M6VU,I love this DVD. Hiromi is even better when you can see her play. She is an amazingly gifted pianist. The music seems to be sucked up out of the keys into her fingers and it just creates an energy you have to see to believe. Art Tatum would have thought her his equal or better. There's a lot of classical influence in her playing. I suspect she goes through a Yamaha piano every few weeks. I'm a new fan but totally sold.,1458432000,,422,4.096385542168675

8432542,4,B004K7M6VU,This is an almost intimate setting. Her playing is outstanding as always. I am really surprised that crowd seem to have little reaction to the wonderful things she is playing. if you love Hiromi it is worth getting but the live feeling just doesn't seem to be there as the crowd seems very subdued. Enjoy the music because Hiromi solo is fantastic!,1393286400,3,348,4.629032258064516
8432543,5,B004K7M6VU,"but this is the next best thing. Hearing Hiromi is one thing.  Seeing her perform it is another.  For one, you will probably never hear the same song performed exactly alike, constantly improving, improvising, throwing a changeup.  Many have written about her skill set, and it's all true. You just have to see it to fully appreciate it.  I've seen criticism about the lighting on this video, but don't worry. The stage and Hiromi are lit just fine.  If you are trying to see who you might know in the audience, then, yes, you will have some trouble.
I'd rather dwell on the audio.
If you are not a hifi buff, well you should be. This is a typically excellent Telarc recording. The system I do most of my viewing/listening on is high on quality, but short on size due to wifely contraints that keep my speakers sitting on the fireplace mantle, and a center channel speaker that had to fit in the 5 inch space below the bottom of our flatscreen.  There is also a subwoofer mounted in the component shelving unit, and ancient, but quality small surrounds on stands, all in the family room, adjacent to the kitchen. Given the size and budget constraints, it sounds pretty amazing.  When I play this disc, I am there, in the club, the tinkling glasses, the table talk, the piano's foot pedals, the body of the piano spilling its' guts as Hiromi drives it past normal limits.
My brother on the other hand, has no wifely constraints, has a larger setup of comparable quality, with full range towers, as well as a beefier subwoofer receiver and surrounds. I brought this dvd over to his place one day, and we were not only in the room, but on the stage. In addition to all I said before, you can hear the stage floor resonate beneath you. Thrilling.  Also brought over her ""Voice"" dvd with her current trio ensemble. On my system, Anthony Jackson's bass rolls off in lower registers and I am forced to imagine what I'm missing.  On my brothers', omg. Every note is there, precise as can be. It's a beautiful thing (also Telarc). I was sad to go home, knowing those gorgeous notes were never going to be heard unless I could, well, you know...",1380585600,3,2135,4.510362694300518
8432544,4,B004K7M6VU,"My title sums it up. I agree with the review that unfavourably compared it with her Marciac performance (the entirety of which is available on youtube). But in my opinion the main problem is not video quality. It's simply that Hiromi needs the big audience to absorb the enormity of what she's putting out, and to react to it.

 While most of the songs are on her Place to Be CD, the songs are much warmer when played live so this is better. Of course, I have both, because Hiromi deserves as much money as I can throw at her. In any case, this performance still has to be seen to be believed. And until Hiromi recognizes that her strength is as a solo act and stops touring with those bombastic men she's out with now, this is your best chance to fully appreciate one of the great pianists who has ever lived.

I particularly like how cute she is with the intro to The Gambler. She changes it up from other performances - e.g. the one on youtube which I think was filmed in Japan (great camera work on that one). She is a true improvisational artist.",1371513600,2,1051,4.297979797979798
8432545,5,B004K7M6VU,"There is never a dull moment on this DVD.  Refreshingly free of annoying ads and coming attractions at the beginning, the DVD simply launches into the concert, and what a concert it is.

The previous reviewer deducted a star for the video quality. To me that isn't a big deal because what you see on the screen is probably better than the view you would get if you were in the audience at the Blue Note. The lighting does seem a bit uneven but I thought everything was clear and there was no fancy, distracting stuff with zoom in or zoom outs or frequent cutaways, stuff like that. The video portion is tasteful and simple. It is obvious that Ms. Uehara is enjoying herself immensely.

Sound-wise, it's a 2.0 LPCM track. This will give your speakers a wonderful workout. It's totally solo piano (although Ms. Uehara does add some percussion of her own like footstomping, and also plays around with the strings) and then a bit of the audience. There's excellent dynamics - very important in capturing the right mood. It's like having her playing in your living room - just turn up the volume and enjoy.

Music-wise, like I said, there's never a dull moment. Her technique is astonishing. At first you may think she's just trying to show off by moving her fingers as fast as possible and squeezing as many notes in a specified amount of time but that's not the case at all. Every piece was melodic and moving - she really gets you into the song not only by her enthusiastic manner but by the character injected into each song. I was sitting there thinking, doesn't she ever get tired?  The performances are energetic, captivating and have real character to them. It's not one of those piano concerts in which you find yourself falling asleep or have to put up with free-form antics that are akin to seeing a painting with splotches thrown all over the place and you have to pretend like you understand what the artist was trying to communicate while you scratch your head wondering, do people pay money for this??  Instead, this is a DVD of seriously good music that is easy to appreciate and involves the listener/viewer.

Like the first reviewer said, I say it too - get the DVD. This is a marvelous performance.",1303516800,8,2212,4.584810126582278
