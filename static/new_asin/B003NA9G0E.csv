4156685,5,B003NA9G0E,"You're Beautiful is a wholesome, fun, engaging drama about the classic ""girl plays boy"" scenario. The disks are USA coded, the subtitles are embedded so that they play automatically (and they are in English) and each episode is a full hour of hilarious fun! My sixteen year old niece was immediately interested in the storyline, which focuses on the daily life of a girl named Ko Mi Nyu who is pretending to be her twin brother, Ko Mi Nam. It is a refreshingly innocent experience after shows like True Blood that showcase loose morality and easy sex. There are sixteen episodes and I can guarantee that you will play them one right after the other, just to find out what could possibly happen next! In all, an excellent show with an amazing cast and a very catchy soundtrack that will leave you feeling good in the aftermath.",1283817600,3,826,4.625850340136054
4156686,5,B003NA9G0E,"This is the best Korean Drama I have seen in a long time. While mostly stepping away from formula, the characters interact wonderfully and the humor extends to the end of the show. Yay! I'm almost glad it did not get extended as they can sometimes drag out and the storylines sometimes change and the characters with them.

The soundtrack is super! The two leads are not in bands outside of the show, but they should be. They do their own singing along with their great acting. The other two leads really are in bands outside of the show and it just adds to the fun. If you want something romantic, charming, funny, easy to watch with a great soundtrack, this is for you. I couldn't recommend it more.",1283472000,,701,4.434108527131783
4156687,5,B003NA9G0E,"this is one of the best dramas i have ever watched!  it is in my top 2!  and i have watched A LOT of dramas!
i love the characters!  you think it is going to be a generic asian girl-pretends-to-be-boy drama, but it is WONDERFUL!

you really start to root for your favorite characters and feel the emotions with the characters!
when the devil fairy actress gets in the way you really start to dislike her and want to see go minam prevail!

shin woo, reminds me of ji hoo but with a slightly sadder feeling!
jeremy is adorable!  you love him no matter what!

i ever write reviews like this, but my gosh this drama is so good, that i must spread the love!
i have told all of my friends to watch it, and bought the dvds so we can watch episodes together!

i didn't get any sleep while watching this!",1281484800,2,795,4.150326797385621
4156688,5,B003NA9G0E,"This one is THE best Korean drama, ever! The main assumption is unrealistic; boy and girl twin looks and sounds exactly same?? I know it can't be true. However, the drama is so well made that I didn't care about it at all. Characters in this drama are so lovely that I love all of them. The main actor (Jang Geun Suk) is just PERFECT for the main character, as Jennifer Aniston for Rachel in Friends. I enjoyed every second of this drama. I will buy the DVD so I can watch it over and over again!",1278633600,29,496,4.123711340206185
4156689,5,B003NA9G0E,"I'm an American who loves watching foreign drama but I was starting to give the habit up since I had a hard time finding one that would capture my interest when I came across this one gem of a story.

I fell totally in love with ""You're Beautiful"". The cast was amazing, so much so, that I just couldn't stop watching.

To top it off, the soundtrack made me want to run out and learn Korean asap! The melodies were entrancing and beautiful. The talent in this show was absolutely flawless, from the singing to the acting.

It was funny, heartwrenching and lovely. I'm buying this item. It's well worth the money and the time.",1278460800,51,625,4.417391304347826
4156690,5,B003NA9G0E,"This drama is very different from the common Korean drama.  The story line is about a love story but it comes with a fun package i.e. adorable boy-band with terrific music and cool fashion sense!

There are a lot of laughs throughout the drama.  You will fall in love with ANJELL (the name of the boy-band) when you watched the drama!

Jang Keun-suk is putting in an excellent performance being the heartthrob lead singer-songwriter of the band.  The other 3 actors/actresses are also giving their best which make the story colorful and fun.

Very good for relaxing summer enjoyment.  Highly recommend!!",1278374400,3,603,4.910891089108911
4156691,5,B003NA9G0E,"I first saw this Korean Drama back when it aired on SBS in late 2009 here in the States. I was flipping the channels and only stopped because I adore Asian women, so I started watching the show. It was in English subtitles and the show was going pretty well so I kept watching. It's one of those moments where you can't change the channel and You're Hooked.

It's a Story about a young-soon to be Nun that has to take the place of her twin brother who is signing a major deal with a boy group called A.N.Jell. She must become her brother until he gets back from the US where he is having surgery over an accident he had. You follow The Group from behind the scenes and get a glimpse of their life.

I enjoyed it so much I am ordering this DVD and watching it all over again.

It's actually getting a cult following and people are wanting a season 2.

I'm not sure of the specs. of the DVD but I think I read it comes with a behind the scenes look at the making of the show, I believe it runs 180 min.

If you enjoy Asian Dramas or enjoy funny shows with Romance, Drama this here is something you might like as well.",1277856000,43,1115,4.05
4156692,5,B003NA9G0E,"This is so much fun to watch. All the drama, k-drama between the band. Everyone falls for the girl. I think I've watched this more because of its length. You can watch it in two days with a little dedication. I love happy endings.",1392940800,,230,4.25
4156693,5,B003NA9G0E,"When I saw this drama on Netflix, I did not realize that his drama was a great hit in Japan a while ago--I was not interested in Korean drama then. Anyway, when I was watching it, I felt as if I were reading Japanese girls' comics that I used to enjoy while growing up. It seems that all the Korean romantic dramas have features similar to girls' comics, and I think that is why they are so popular in Japan. You will enjoy this drama If you have enjoyed Boys Over Flowers or Playful Kiss (both of which were based on Japanese girls' comic books). I decided to buy the  DVD version of this drama even though I already watched the whole drama on Netflix, because I wanted to watch them for multiple times while staying in Japan where I do not have an access to Netflix.",1391299200,,768,4.224489795918367
4156694,5,B003NA9G0E,"This show seems to strike viewers one of two ways: they absolutely love it (like me) or absolutely hate it. I admit I'm partial to  (Jang Geun Suk - ugh, Romanization does his name no justice), so that probably played a big part. But still, it's just adorable, funny, cute, romantic, light-hearted and feel-good. You will never forget the ""It's a pig...run!!!"" scene.  Nor the first time she really takes a good look at him. Nor the first kiss. (*Squeal*) The music is TOO GOOD and honestly brought me to tears at times. I'm such a baby. I still loved this show even though there were some annoying parts like all three of them falling in love with her. Nahh. She's such a klutz that I had secondhand embarrassment for 2/3 of the series. And even still it's one of my all-time favorites, for whatever it's worth.",1390953600,,812,4.517006802721088
4156695,5,B003NA9G0E,"I don't know what it is, but I couldn't stop watching episodes back to back. I enjoy watching how a girl would try to fool these guys into thinking she was a man. I had fun watching this, and will treasure it for a long time.",1386892800,,225,3.9130434782608696
4156696,1,B003NA9G0E,"You can watch it online for free, why pay nearly two hundred for it? that's outrageous. It's only like 16 episodes or one season. You can get a season of basically any American TV show for about $20-30. I say save money and watch it online. There are plenty of websites that show it, subtitles and all.",1386201600,,302,4.315789473684211

4156698,5,B003NA9G0E,"I was interested in the tea cup that was displayed in the scene with Taekyung's mother it was so pretty

4156699,5,B003NA9G0E,"I'm not saying you have to agree it is the best Korean drama ever, but it's pretty good. Yeah, Park Shin Hye is the least passable guy but hello Go Mi Nam = Flower Boy aka kind of girly guy. This is one of the Hong sisters best dramas to date. So if someone tells you it's not that good, never trust them again. This is definitely worth a watch.
Although, I don't know why it costs $200. Watch it on Hulu or Netflix. Then if you love it that much consider buying it, but not from Amazon.",1374364800,,487,3.979591836734694
4156700,5,B003NA9G0E,"Innocent and kind orphan, Go Mi Neyo, is a nun in-training. Living at the church for so many years, she has little awareness of what's happening in the world outside.

Her twin brother, Go Mi Nam, is about to sign on with a popular band in Korea called, A.N.Jell. The band is composed of three heartthrobs, Jeremy, Shin Woo, and leader Tae Kyung. Jeremy is playful and silly. Shin Woo is thoughtful and protective. And leader Tae Kyung is snobbish and persnickety. Unfortunately, Go Mi Nam is stuck in the U.S. recovering from surgery, which puts him out of commission for a short time. The bands manager tracks down his sister in hopes of her pretending to be Mi Nam until he returns. However, the other band members and everyone else are not allowed to know. Mi Neyo reluctantly agrees.

Mi Neyo believed her calling was to be a nun, but as she gets to know the guys and explores the world around her she starts to feel differently about her life. Especially when she falls in love with Tae Kyung.

The main actress, Park Shin Hye, is so funny! There were lot's of laugh-out-loud moments. The drama is not only humorous, but heartwarming, fun, and sweet. There are also plenty of interesting love triangles too.

All the main actors are great. This show actually brought the main characters a lot of popularity. The three main guys are not only actors, but are singers too. Jang Geun Suk (Tae Kyung) is a solo singer, Jung Yong Hwa (Shin Woo) is from the band ""C.N. Blue,"" and Lee Hong Ki (Jeremy) is from the group ""F.T. iland."" And speaking of singers, the music in the drama is great too and sung by the actors themselves. All the songs are fun, memorable, and full of emotion.

""You're Beautiful"" is 16 episodes. If you like this show, I also recommend watching and listening to the soundtrack of ""Heartstrings."" The main actress, Park Shin Hye and actor, Jung Yong Hwa, from ""You're Beautiful"" are the main characters in the romantic comedy, ""Heartstrings."" The rest of C.N. Blue is also in ""Heartstrings.""",1373155200,,2013,4.627450980392157
4156701,5,B003NA9G0E,"This was the first Korean TV series I watched and I've been addicted ever since.  However, this is my all time favorite!  I watch it over and over.  It is good family viewing.  It is funny, sweet, dramatic at times and all around good entertainment.  I love it!

The product itself arrived earlier than expected, well packed, in excellent condition and brand new.  I would recommend this seller.",1370390400,,395,4.720588235294118
4156702,3,B003NA9G0E,"The story kept my interest, but I did feel aggravated with it at times. That weird mouth expression of the main male character started getting on my nerves, as well as all that bauling the girl was doing. She had no back bone whatsoever. The plot between the main couple was a bit mellow dramatic. Some of the reactions from the main couple didn't make sense and seemed stupid. On the whole it was an entertaining drama and an interesting story. I think it could have been better if the main male actor had perfected his arrogance (i.e., his walk and the facial expressions seemed juvenile at times). Also, the kissing scenes between the main characters looked retarded. People don't act frozen like that for that long, as if they've got too much starch in their drawers. If you're going to have a kissing scene, do it right. He started off good at least.",1369440000,,855,4.558441558441558
4156703,5,B003NA9G0E,"I have watched this drama no less that 8 times in the past few months.  I really love the music, but there are no sound tracks available that have all of the songs all together, and I have read that several of those that are out have a lot of extra stuff that was not in the movie. I also really loved the actors and actresses in this film, and I think that they were cast perfectly. I would really love to see a season 2 and 3 of this series, but I am not sure how they would have to do it. The actors all seemed to have great chemistry.",1365638400,,538,3.8468468468468466
4156704,4,B003NA9G0E,"I love Korean drama, I love Korean boy bands, and I love genderbending! There were some great plot twists and the music is good, but the lead actress is far too feminine to fool anyone. The whole point is that she's supposed to look just like her twin brother and be able to take his place in a boy band - without telling the other group members or the fans and press - because he's recovering from a botched plastic surgery. How anyone could possibly mistake her for male is beyond comprehension. But she's so adorable it's impossible to be mad at her for being a super girly girl...

The drama starts off pretty whacky and I didn't like it in the beginning. The heroine of the story is a nun much like Maria of ""The Sound of Music,"" in that she's a major screw-up at everything she does. Then she gets roped into posing as her brother in a boy band so he won't lose his slot while he's recovering from surgery. There are a lot of interesting dynamics within the group; at first they hate her because she's a screw-up and so awkward, but one by one they realize she's a woman and fall in love with her. Well, one of them falls for her still thinking she's a guy, which would be awesome for slash fans except for the fact that no one could possibly mistake her for a man in reality. She doesn't look, sound, or walk in a masculine way at all, so it's hard to even pretend as you watch the show that the other characters actually think she's male for a long time. It's hard for the plot to hold together because of it, but it's still a fun idea.

Once you get through the first episode with the nun's ridiculous antics, specifically a car chase between the nun on a bike and her brother's agent (WTF), the story is a lot more fun. It is the kind of show that can make you laugh out loud, though it gets a bit more serious and dramatic as her deception begins to crumble, and she has to face up to her lies. The relationships between the band members are also really interesting to watch, because they evolve a lot from beginning to end. I'd say that was my favorite part of the show.

When I first watched this drama, I got hooked by the third episode and couldn't shut it off. I bought the soundtrack and some collectibles (bookmarks, notebooks) but honestly, when I tried rewatching it, I got bored during the first episode and never watched it again. I think once you get past that first bit, though, it really is a good show.",1365292800,,2428,4.262472885032538
4156705,5,B003NA9G0E,"I have watched a lot of Korean drama but this is one that stuck with me for a longtime! It will having you laughing out loud one episode and will break your heart the next. The best gauge of a series is one that makes you feel along with the characters - You're Beautiful will take you on an emotional roller coaster!

Go Mi Nyu has decided to become a nun but before she can take her vows she is convinced to cover for her twin brother for awhile. Her twin brother is on the verge of sign on to a record label but some botched plastic surgery prevents him from obtaining his dream. Go Mi Nyu disguise herself as him and takes his place, unbeknownst to the other band members. If dressing up as a boy and try to deal with super stardom isn't enough, the other band members are a challenge the has Go Mi all twisted up. Along the way Go Mi realizes that her brother did not want to join the band just to become famous, but to also find the parents that abandon them at birth. Ultimately, Go Mi must struggle with hard trues, the brutality of stardom, and new found feelings of love - once all the band members start falling for her (even before the know she is a girl)!!!

One of the best things about this drama is the catchy music. I find myself humming it to myself in the shower occasionally. The production value of the series and performances is much better than you typically find in K-drama.

If you liked Boys Over Flowers you will love this drama! I strongly recommend for any K-drama fan.",1364256000,,1498,4.249122807017544
4156706,5,B003NA9G0E,"I had watched this on youtube and enjoyed it so much I bought the DVD.  It is a breakthrough hit for Jang Geun Suk and a delight for those who like him.  I enjoyed the innocent romance, the music and the funny moments in the story.

4156708,5,B003NA9G0E,"I admit, I had my reservations after the first episode I almost gave up on it, actually.  But because I knew some drama's took a few episodes to get into the story, I decided to keep on watching.  Oh boy, am I happy I did that!  If I hadn't given this a chance, I would have missed out on watching an excellent drama!  This is one of the best K-Drama's produced in the past five years.  The cast is great and the production quality is high!

This is an actual, legitimate box set of You're Beautiful created for region 1 players.  Unfortunately, the company that brought this DVD to Region 1 viewers is no longer in business, so get it while you can!

I also recommend checking out my all time favorite K-drama's- My Girl, Full House, and Pasta!",1361145600,,745,4.309352517985611

I fell in love with this show so much so that every day that I come home I watch the last Hr of the show because that is how love should and could be plus I have to hear that beautiful song and all the beautiful music that goes with it.

4156732,4,B003NA9G0E,"This is a Korea drama that takes a new twist on an old theme; girl assumes identity of a boy.  This is done to protect a sibling and she replaces him in a Korea Pop-Rock Group that is successful. Most pleasant and very enjoyable.  There is love, the implication of sex and comedy.  This makes Asian films to me so enjoyable.  There is very little outwardly expressed sex except for some kissing.  However, the implication is very prevalent which makes for getting into the theme and plot a lot more interesting.  This is a very young cast, most of them are younger the 25 years; most are in their 20's; one may be even 19 years.

4156738,4,B003NA9G0E,"I like this Kdrama because it harkens back to the silly tv romances of the 50s and 60s like the flying nun and herbie the love bug.  To put it shortly, the story is about a young nun in training who takes on the roll of her m.i.a. brother posing as a new member of a boy band.

While the premise is pretty fluffy, there are additional elements that flesh out the storyline to give it depth.  You will find yourself rooting for Chin Woo's unreturned love of Go Mi Nam...(enough people liked this couple- which they later filmed Heartstrings (another must see).) Its fun to find how the guys compete to win her favor.  The OST is pretty good, I have a couple of the singles. And I want one of those Pig Bunnies!

Overall, while kind of juvenille, this drama has a lot of appeal due to the actors/musicians.  Its a great downtime kind of show with lots of heart.",1327276800,,859,4.271604938271605

You feel for almost all the characters involved. Yes it's a bit of a stretch that she can pass for her brother in both looks and voice, but it's kind of the point that she doesn't fully pull it off without a lot of help with the people around her who know or find out. If you like this, check out Heartstrings which kind of gives a point in the love-triangle another try.",1325203200,,519,4.148514851485149

Both have the bonus of me being able to select any episode to watch and finding a favorite moment.  I LOVE Jang Geun-Seok as 'Hyung-nim' to appropriate Mi-nam's name for him.  He's wonderfully moody and logical all at once. He seriously knows how to work his guyliner and his facial expressions say more than paragraphs of dialogue.  He is exactly what the lead singer of a guy band should be like, charismatic with an air of mystery.

The plot is simple, Go Mi-Nam is set to debut as a second lead singer with the hit group A.N.JELL except he had a botched plastic surgery procedure and is unable to make his initial appearance.  Luckily for him and his manager he has a twin, a female twin who looks just like him (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twelfth-Night/dp/1461030218/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twelfth Night</a>&nbsp;Anyone?

The other members of the band are wary of Mi Nam (Nyu in disguise) and Tae Kyung (JGS) is openly challenging and hostile (though he is that way with most people).  Her sweet nature easily wins over the other members of the band and even though Tae Kyung finds out very early on that she is a female, he still does his darndest not to fall for her sweet charms. (Hah! Guyliner won't protect you from what must happen!)

This show isn't all fluff, it has its moments where not only the two romantic leads take the audience on an emotional trip, but other characters as well.  The supporting cast is fantastic and perfectly cast (if you don't have a little crush on Lee Hong Ki as Jeremy by the end...how can you resist someone who has named their Golden Retriever Angelina Jolie?)

The 'fake' music is ridiculously catchy, you might as well download/buy the soundtrack for it at the same time as you buy the DVDs, just thinking about it gets songs stuck in my head--and I don't know Korean.

4156754,5,B003NA9G0E,"I LOVE this show. i started watching it on whim one day. i was home sick and looking for a good foreign movie to watch on Youtube when i happened to come across the first episode of this show.

During the first few minutes i thought it was a little weird...but it was funny so i kept watching. Before i knew it i was on Hulu watching the entire season!

I love the guys in the series:

Taekyung (Jang Keun-Suk) is Beautiful...and arrogant. How his mind works and comes up with the conclusions it does baffles me at times...But as much of a pain in the butt as he is, he's also quite charming and lovable. He has his moments that just leave you going ""Awe! Kawii!!!"" which is Japanese for cute not Korean but still. lol

Then there is Shinwoo who see too much and is such a big brother you can't help but love him.

And then there is Jeremy...Crazy, funny, slower than a snail in the sun Jeremy. You have to love him through all of his stunts. He's just so cute...Even when he thinks he's going gay because he's the last to find out Minam is in fact a girl.

And Minam is funny, and Klutzy and quite the little trouble maker. She gets herself into some funny perdicaments and she's quite niave-but then again who wouldn't be when they've spent their entire life in a church wanting to become a nun-but very loveable and pretty easy to relate to.

Watching this series was like watching a 17 hour movie you just wanted to keep going...

But it has a good ending. no leaving you hanging and making you crazy.

Plus the music in this show is awesome and addicting. i had to order the cd offline after i watched it and I've been jamming to it in my car for like a month now. :D

Anyways, if you're looking for something funny, and heart warming this is the show for you!

If you're into Korean movies and dramas I promise you'll like it! But i warn you...once you start you're going to have one heck of a time turning it off to get some sleep or go to work!",1300406400,13,1952,4.192513368983957

Luckily for me, it was on sale so I didn't feel as bad. Anyway, no synopsis here as you can read those elsewhere. The main problem for me is the female lead doesn't look anything like a male and would never be mistaken for one. Also, the storyline isn't all that great as I had to force myself to finish the series. This is only my opinion but, for a show about music, it wasn't all that great. Before I bought it, I told a friend about this series and how great it's supposed to be. I let her borrow it and she told me it's one of the worse series she's ever seen. If you're thinking about buying this set, look for it online first and watch a couple of episodes, what I should have done, to see if you'll like it. If you want to watch some good K-dramas, at least in my opinion, try some of these: 18 vs 29, A Prince's First Love, IRIS, All In, Flowers For My Life, Be Strong Geum Soon, Prosecutor Princess, Sweet Spy, Love Story in Harvard, Boys Over Flowers, Attic Cat, The Grand Chef, Bad Couple, General Hospital 2, Dae Jang Geum and Next. 18 vs 29 and IRIS are two of my faves while Flowers For My Life is funny yet very sad at the same time and will definately bring tears to your eyes. I haven't finish Next yet, as of this review, but from the first three episodes it's pretty interesting to say the least.

The interesting spin they place on the story is not only is the sister disguised as a boy but she is a nun who knows nothing of the outside world.  Add to that a splash of Bridget Jones bumblingess and a bit of cultural spoofing and you have an enjoyable series that is hard to stop watching once you start.  The characters are delightful and the humor is hilarious.

I was on youtube one day, just bored, and i found this video about the show You're Beautiful. it caught my interest so I watched an episode online. And to say i was hooked was an understatement. I absolutely LOVE the show. It's so funny and cute and interesting. you start out watching one episode and before you know it you're on the 5th. (each ep is about one hour and 20 mins or something to that nature). I have to say it's one of he best shows i have ever watched!!! i usually get bored with a show because it just becomes dull and repetitive, but not this. I assure you, this will not disappoint. I mean, i like it so much that i went on amazon to buy a copy for myself. that's how much i like it. :D

well, the story takes place when a young girl studying to be a nun is approached my her twin brother's manager. since her brother is in america, he can't accept this amazing opportunity for his career as a singer. so, the manager asks the young girl if she could take her brother's place in the position of the boy band until he returns in a month. the girl did not want to do this but then she agrees and also uses this opportunity to look for her mother. (her and her brother were left with the nuns as children. they were orphans and all they know about their parents was that their father, a song writer, died and their mother is a singer). things turn for the worse when the group leader force her to sing. amazingly, she has a great voice like her brother and the band members quickly accept her. now she must live every day pretending to be a male in a house of 3 other male members of the band. but what happens if one of the members find out she's a girl? will he help her hide this secret or will he want to kick her out?

this is a very funny story with a clumsy and clueless girl, who tries her best to not cause problems for the other band members, but ends up doing just that. things get interesting when she starts to fall in love with the band's leader. the plot to his show is very unique and unexpected in many ways. if you want to watch a light-hearted comedy that will make you laugh, this is for you. trust me one ep. and you're hooked. here's a site if you want to watch the eps. online before you buy it:  [...]

Nun-in-training posing as member of a boy-band?) but if you can get past such inconsistencies/unlikeliness (as anyone familiar with Asian dramas probably already has) I'd say this one is worth checking out.

8400807,5,B003NA9G0E,I loved the entire  show. The screen backgrounds  for the action were colorful and beautifully natural. The approach to the age old subject  of boy meets girl vice versa was presented in a dramatic and exciting way. kept my attention through out the whole series. The energy of youth displayed by the characters was exhilarating.,1396828800,,329,4.945454545454545
