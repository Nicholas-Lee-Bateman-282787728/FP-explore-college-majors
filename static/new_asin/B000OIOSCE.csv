8185338,3,B000OIOSCE,"It's a very simple film, possibly made without a budget, but it is informative and I enjoyed the focus on how to use Essential Oils in massage!",1471132800,,143,4.333333333333333
8185339,1,B000OIOSCE,"This video is hilariously poorly produced. We rented thinking to maybe learn a little about the scents traditionally associated with particular responses or about how aromatherapy might be beneficial during massage etc, but instead turned it off after the fourth tedious explanation of carrier oils. This would be a Tim and Eric gold mine.",1455580800,2,339,5.296296296296297
8185340,2,B000OIOSCE,It was just interviews and was boring. Didn't finish it.,1434758400,,56,4.7
8185341,3,B000OIOSCE,Good information.  Poor film quality.,1425427200,,37,6.4
8185342,1,B000OIOSCE,This reminds me of the training films we watched in nursing school in the 70's. Boring and really not much info.,1402963200,3,112,4.380952380952381
8185343,1,B000OIOSCE,"Only got about 10 minutes into it:  It was too slow... tedious... A documentary on Aroma therapy should have inspired the viewer about the marvels of it... maybe starting with testimonials about how well it worked for them....  This was amateurish.  I'm shocked that Amazon Prime has SO MANY of these poor quality documentaries in their ""free with Prime"" selection, and so few really good selections.  Kind of a 'bait and switch':  They lure you in thinking you're getting such a fantastic deal... only $79 a year... and then have nothing but grade B movies to choose from.",1400457600,5,573,4.8061224489795915
8185344,1,B000OIOSCE,"The sound quality is HORRIBLE.  Between the British accents and the fuzzy sound, I had to concentrate a great deal to listen to the speakers.  Buy another dvd on the topic....",1265414400,2,175,4.612903225806452
