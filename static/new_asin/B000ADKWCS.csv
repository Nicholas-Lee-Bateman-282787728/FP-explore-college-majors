8077971,5,B000ADKWCS,"We rented this DVD several times from Netflix and kept it for several days, sometimes weeks-- our entire family loves it. It's very creative and unique and I'll finally purchase our own copy today. I have a 2 year old and 4 year old btw but I think any child 6 months and above will enjoy the catchy tunes and awesome visual artistry.",1303430400,,334,4.317460317460317
8077972,1,B000ADKWCS,"I bought this DVD for my 3-year old daughter because I saw it in the Parenting Magazine and I thought the cover looked cute.  My daughter is now 5, and we watched the DVD 1 and 1/2 times, if that.  It's just not her (or mine, for that matter) style.  The songs are slow, unengaging, and the cartoons bizzare.  Maybe somebody can buy it from me, I'll give you a great deal!  (-:",1287878400,,377,4.109589041095891

The artwork is whimsical and creative, the lyrics are clever,fun and often thoughtful, and the music is infectious.  It would make a great gift.",1268352000,,299,4.711538461538462
8077974,5,B000ADKWCS,I bought this for my nearly 2 year old boys and they absolutely adore every single part of this DVD.  They love to dance and sing along and never get tired of it.  The bonus is that it is easy to watch over and over for adults too!,1202947200,,231,3.7916666666666665
