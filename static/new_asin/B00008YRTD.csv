1868455,4,B00008YRTD,"While hysterically funny, I felt there were more than a few references to breast humor and sex than need be rendered in a PG rated film.  The innuendos take a childs mind racing in the wrong direction and away from the clever story at hand.  The enhanced Kangaroo graphics were fair to good.  The two main actors catered well to adults and youngins alike in a comedic sense through excellent facial expressions, tone, and body language.  An exciting ending for the ""good guys"".  All in all, it moved quickly and concisely.",1043107200,6,522,4.6923076923076925
1868456,2,B00008YRTD,"Charlie (Jerry O'Connell, `Crossing Jordan`) is a hairstylist who finds himself in continuous debt to his bumbling friend Louis (Anthony Anderson, `Barbershop'), who saved him from drowning when he was eight years-old. When one of Louis's harebrained schemes gets the two into hot water, they are sent to Australia to atone for their sins by delivering fifty thousand dollars to a shady businessman. While driving to the drop off point, the two hit a roaming kangaroo on the road and promptly dress it up in Louis's lucky jacket for photo opportunities. When the kangaroo suddenly regains consciousness, he takes off, with the jacket still on, and the fifty grand in one of the pockets. With the help of a kangaroo tracker (Estella Warren, `Driven'), Louis and Charlie must brave the deadly outback to get their money back and restore honor to their names.
Approaching a film like `Kangaroo Jack' takes plenty of patience and good will. Produced by the virtual Willy Wonka of ... cinema, Jerry Bruckheimer (`Armageddon,' `Con Air,` `Pearl Harbor`), `Kangaroo Jack' is one of the producer's rare forays into family filmmaking. I'm happy to report that `Jack' is a slick production - for a kid's film at least - ... Directed by David McNally, who last was seen helming another Bruckheimer disaster, `Coyote Ugly,' `Kangaroo Jack' isn't nearly the tragedy its exterior suggests. It's a bad film, no doubt, yet not a complete wash out.
The problems start with the generally unpleasant comedic delivery of co-star Anthony Anderson, who has never met a punch line he didn't like to completely bleed dry of its funny. A bellowing, rancid yuckster, Anderson simply turns up his usual deafening routine a couple of notches so the kids can hear him clearly. He's the clown of the piece, but never a likeable one. ... It's completely fraudulent, but also insults the terrific work the computer animators put into the kangaroo creation, as they try to merge authenticity with cartoon. The kangaroo looks wonderful, but the rapping is heartbreaking, and should clearly not be the focus of the film.
Yet, in trying to see past the useless story conceits (Italian mobsters in the Outback?), paycheck acting (Christopher Walken appears briefly as Charlie's father-in-law), and, well, critically unfunny material (almost anything with Anderson), there are brief moments of pleasure to be found. Jerry O'Connell is one of those bright spots, refraining from his usual overacting, and simply letting Anderson go nuts for a laugh. O'Connell is funnier this way, and it helps the movie greatly to have at least one cast member who isn't yelling all the time. Also, model Estella Warren puts in a reasonable performance in the tracker role. In the long, headache-inducing pantheon of model-to-actress transitions, Warren is near the top of the heap. `Jack' doesn't offer much for her to work with, but she's a pleasant surprise in a gloriously unsurprising film.
As much as I could (or should) ... `Kangaroo Jack,' there are just too many minuscule good things within the film for it to be a completely deflating experience. The kids might love it, and any chance to soak up Australian beauty is welcomed, but there just isn't enough hop in the 'roo to hold appeal for very long.",1043107200,2,3257,5.011070110701107
1868457,5,B00008YRTD,"Me, my brother and my friend went to see this movie last night and we had a good time, it turned out to be a complete different story than I expected cause this movie involves with mobsters, my favorite character in this movie is Louis cause he is such an idiot (in a funny sort of way) but my only gripe in this movie is a few parts of the movie should've been rated PG-13 instead of PG, this movie is not recommended for very young children but it's recommended for the whole family, I probably won't watch this movie again till it comes out on video.",1042848000,8,553,4.177570093457944
1868458,3,B00008YRTD,"Kangarro Jack is for the record a funny movie, but not PG funny.  Has movie ratings gone so soft that a movie that clearly would of been PG-13 less than 5 years now only a PG movie.  Not sure what I am talking about, let me explain.
Kangaroo Jack is about a group of buds who lose $50,000 to a Kangaroo.  Now the back story is that JErry O'Connell is a hair stylist!? who step dad (Christopher Walken) runs a mafia inside of NEw York.  After his bud screws up a job for Walken they are given one last chance at redemption.  A simple job that requires delivering $50,000.00 to a client in Australia.  Along they way the end up losing the cash and are being pursued by the mafia and the client.  THeir only hope is to get the cash back.  Along the way they meet the hot chick who helps them catch the Kangaroo.
Now here is why I say that a few years ago this would of been PG-13.  Lets start with the obviouse, language.  FOr a movie targeted towards children there sure as hell is a lot of profanity, toilet humor, and sexual dialouge. Here is an example of a funny line, but not an approriate one for a kids movie ""We are experienceing an intimate Non Gay Moment"".  Then there is a scene where the hot chick is washing off some berry juice (One of their tactics to try and catch it) and the way the scene is shot, the shadows imply that she is topless.  But then we see it is only a wet T-SHirt.  IT is also at that point that she and JErry O'Connell start making out.
These are just a few examples of why this movie is not a PG movie, and even if it is it sure as hell is not for kids.  The movie is funny, but I would not take kids younger than 12 to see this.",1042848000,27,1662,4.0121580547112465
1868459,3,B00008YRTD,"This movie is being bombed by reveiwers all over ,but myself and guess ,along with the whole theatre found plenty of nonsence too laugh at.
 In a nut shell two kids become friends  when one saves the others life. 20yrs later...the two buddies  end up boshing up a delevery job that cause the ones stepfather (mob head) ..To be investagated by the police. So without a second thought the Stepfather sends his son and friend on a trip too Austraila too make a Delivery. There told not too look in the envolope...do they obey no ofcourse not..before they get off the plane they find out they are delevering a illgal amount of $50,000. So after slipping through customs and hitting the road they hit a Kangaroo. They start taking pictures. They put on the friends jacket with the money envolope,Only then do they relize the Kangaroo is still alive and literally kicking. Bye ,bye Jacket ,candy ,passport and $50.000. So its up too our hapless pair too recover the goods. After a completely failed attempt too catch Jack on there own they get, parcill aid from a drunk pilot and later full aid from a wildlife worker from America. There off to countinue the chase. They are also on a time limit too get there passports before they expire& too make the delivery before they get caught by the recieverof the money and stepdads goons. Good fx and just a playfull fun movie.

1868864,4,B00008YRTD,"You sit watching this film, thinking ""I'm not going to like this...I'm not going to like this.""  But as you watch it, these seemingly predictable words do not enter your head.  Oh, you don't love this film, but it's not that bad either.  This is what happened to me.  This film, starring Jerry O'Connell (whom I've never heard of) and Anthony Anderson (in a role jarringly different from his stint on Law and Order), tells the story of how the two men lost a large amount of mob money because it was in the pocket of a jacket that they had jokingly put on a kangaroo they believed to be dead.  Said kangaroo came back to life (or just woke up) and bounced away with the jacket, looking like the hippest wild animal in the Australian Outback...guess he thought it was a gift.  I wonder why the mob boss and his goons had such a low opinion of these guys, one of them being the boss's stepson.  Sarcasm aside, I genuinely wonder what on Earth was going through that kangaroo's mind the whole time he was wearing the jacket.  But regardless of what I spend my time wondering when I should really be getting a life, this was a decent film.  As far-fetched as the plot sounds (it's actually based on a rumor of something similar happening to two university students), it was funny and somewhat worthwhile.  The leads had some good chemistry, so you could tell they were friends who occasionally drove each other nuts...one more than the other.  The love interest, played by Estella Warren, was inserted so there'd be a love interest and that's fairly obvious, but the actress still did her best with the position she found herself in.  I really enjoyed Christopher Walken as the mob boss Salvatore ""Sal"" Maggio...why couldn't we have gotten more of him?  His lead goon Frankie Lombardo, played by Michael Shannon, was all right, but he often came off as more like a schoolyard bully than a mob boss's ""number one guy"" who surely had to have some bodies to his name.  His frustration as he traveled through Australia was funny though.  So, this film isn't the greatest, but it has some laughs and a good story.  Kids will like it and you will survive sitting through it with them.  Enjoy.",1403740800,3,2182,4.539641943734015

1869056,4,B00008YRTD,"Kangaroo Jack(released Jan/03)is a funny and ultimately satisfying romp set,for the most part,in the Australian outback.
The story starts by giving us its two main protagonists Charlie(Jerry O'Connell) and Louis(Anthony(Anderson) in their pre-teen days. Charlie's Mom falls in love and marries a local mobster Salvatore Maggio(Christopher Walken).While at the beach a jealous protoge' of Salvatores by the name of Frankie(Michael Shannon)throws a long ball into the water for Charlie to catch but he is unable to swim. Near drowning Louis,out scanning the sand with a metal detector,sees the situation and runs in to save his life.
Fast forward 20 years and Charlie has his own beauty salon courtesy of his step father and a hanger on of a friend Louis,who always seems to be getting him into trouble. This day Louis asks Charlie to accompany him to unload some hot TVs in a large van. Of course things go awry and along the way they are pursued by the law. They reach their destination and to Charlies surprise it is a warehouse run by Salvatores men. Just at this moment the cops show up and all are busted. Through some wrangling by Salvatore Charlie,Louis et al are all released. Salvatore gives them a total dressing down and then gives Charlie and Louis a job to do for him in Australia. They are to deliver $50,000 to a Mr Smith(Martin Csokas)as a pay off of some kind;the details are a little vague.
When they arrive they head out for their destination near Alice Springs in the interior. Along the way they inadvertantly hit a kangaroo. Thinking they have killed it,they get out and Charlie attempts to drag it off the road. Ala Weekend at Bernies,Louis thinks there's something funny about Charlie and the Kangaroo and starts to take some gag pictures. They even put Louis' ""lucky"" red Brooklyn jacket on it. At this moment the kangaroo comes back to the living and hops away;not before knocking poor Charlie on his keester.
Both start laughing but then Louis realizes something. The $50,000 is in the pocket of the jacket that is now hip hopping its way around the outback. From here on the two set out to retrieve the money. At a bar they meet two people which will come to be helpful to them both. One is a wildlife preservationist called Jessie(Estella Warren) who gives Louis a tranquilizer dart to subdue the ""roo"".The other is a rough and tumble airplane pilot called Blue(Bill Hunter) who will take them into the air to suss out the errant kangaroo. They take off and soon after they find their prey as hoped for. Just as Louis fires the gun the airplane shifts. They look down to see the animal still hopping but back in the plane we see the dart embedded in poor Blue's neck. The inevitable eventually occurs as the trio crash land and Louis and Charlie are forced to hike in the desert to the nearest town for help.
Meanwhile back in the States Salvatore has learned from Mr. Smith that the two have not shown up with the money as promised. Salvatore sends Frankie out to take care of the problem personally. Frankie and some thugs arrive in Australia and start to track the pair down. Louis and Charlie meanwhile are near death in the desert heat and Charlie has already hallucinated due to lack of water. When Jessie happens to show up on a camel with her gear Charlie thinks it's a very cool mirage and with a smile touches Jessie's breasts. The next thing he knows he is waking up on the ground. On their way to find the kangaroo Mr Smith and his men catch up to the trio and demand the money. To buy time Jessie offers to take Mr Smith to where she thinks the kangaroo/money may be,while Louis and Charlie are led off to be killed. They escape and when they find and rescue Jessie are themselves set upon by Frankie who has finally caught up with them.
A fire fight ensues between Mr Smith and Frankie. When Louis,Charlie and Jessie try to escape during the ruckus Louis ends up over a cliffs edge hanging precariously onto the camel reigns. Charlie rushes over and barely saves Louis from certain death. After this commotion the kangaroo strangely comes by and Charlie is able to secure the jacket and money from it. The two men are now even(both have saved one anothers lives) and they finally have the money to turn over. Frankie nor Salvatore it seems cares about the money at all. They learn that they were in essence sent to Australia to pay for their own execution by Mr Smith;which they couldn't even do properly. As he is about to pull the trigger the local police arrive to arrest the bad guys.
Fast forward a year later and Salvatore is behind bars,thanks to Charlie and Louis. Also Charlie and Louis are now rich thanks to some berries they discovered in Australia along their travels  that they have turned into hair care products;Jessie of course is at Charlies side. The movie fades out aboard Charlies luxury yacht.
The movie moves along quite well although the introduction of characters tends to slightly bog down here and there. The movie works on two levels;as a comedy and as the bond between two good friends. The comedy doesn't ramp up until they hit down under but when it does it is always there ready to surface at any time. When the movie starts out Louis is definitely the hangar on in Charlies life due to the fact he had saved him years before and just seems to be milking it for all it is worth. As the movie progresses though the characters bond we find is deeper than the shallow apparition it first appeared to be. By the end all has come full circle and we find that Charlie needed Louis as much as Louis needed Charlie and their bond is now stronger than ever;bff for sure.
The CGI here is also worth mentioning as the kangaroo in the title is for the most part all digital in creation;but very,very real looking and acting. I could not find even a voice credit for Kanagroo Jack in the credits. As an FYI Blue is played by Australian actor Bill Hunter who you may recall was Muriels father in ""Muriels Wedding"".
As far as the technical department is concerned the film has been transferred nicely to its widescreen a/r and everything looks clear and crisp. There are a plethora of extras:Casting Sessions as actors try out for animal auditions,gags and outtakes,learn how to dance like the kangaroo,a look at the camel flatulence scenes,a featurette narrated by the kangaroo,audio commentaries and the trailer. There are also some computer DVD extras.
All in all a nice and fun comedy romp played nicely by all concerned especially the two leads of Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson. Anderson really plays his part well and is Jerry's perfect foil. It is a comedy for sure but the concurrent running under toe of bonding between two life long friends makes it rise above the more mundane comedies of this type.

1869087,2,B00008YRTD,"""Kangaroo Jack"" is similar to ""Boat Trip"" in that its whole attention is based on false advertising.  TV ads, posters, and the DVD cover art picture this attempt at a marketable mascot as Mr. Cool: talking slick, doing dance moves, and singing old songs that are glorified puns of his being; he's suppose to be the next Mc Skat Cat.  The thought of all that cringed me, but it turned out that the marsupial's wayward coolness only occurred in a two-minute dream sequence, as well as the end 'outtakes'.  I was relieved, but then I had to face an even more cringing aspect: Anthony Anderson cracking jokes and getting Jerry O'Connell into trouble.

The real story of ""Kangaroo Jack"" is about a hairdresser (O'Connell) and his buddy con-man (Anderson), although they seems to be friends out of obligation since the con-man rescued the hairdresser's life long ago and neither of them can't stand each other.  They both work for the mob boss (played by an underused Christopher Walken), and after a reckless chase of a heist went horrible wrong by those two, they were sent to Australia to deliver a special package to a Mr. Smith; neither of them knew they were being sent to be executed.  On the way down the desert road, the two found an apparently dead kangaroo they named Jackie Legs; they stupidly made him wear a jacket with the special package inside, but the kangaroo was actually alive and escaped.  Realizing what they lost, they're off on a chase across the outback, while Mr. Smith and the button men eventually chase them with guns blazing.

I'm getting a little bored with the comedy yells.  Jerry and Anthony yell when they're pedaling across a busy traffic to avoid the cops, they yell when they drove their jeep through rocks, they yell when their fighter plane is out of control by their stupid antics, and they yell when bugs are crawling on them.  They're about as predictable as the love-interest in this movie, an animal-caregiver whom she first met them on the plane and eventually falls for the hairdresser, because what girl wouldn't fall for Jerry O'Connell?  Jackie Legs got on my nerves, mainly due to how he was shot; the kangaroo is almost always in a close-up face-shot when he does something humor, like the movie was forcing to kids to say, ""hey, this kangaroo made a funny face.  LAUGH, KIDS, LAUGH!""  Even more astounding is a couple of film goofs I noticed: the mobs were calling Mr. Smith in daylight on both locations, even though due to time difference, it should've been nightime in Australia; and most notably, the scene where the plane destroyed its left wing, but on the next scene the left wing is still in place.

""Kangaroo Jack"" is not only irritating to watch, it's also kinda unfriendly for kids.  Besides the typical misunderstood gag about poo and one's orientation, there's a lot intense violence regarding guns, Jerry copped a feel, and the animal-caregiver took a waterfall bath in a provocative manner (though she's wearing clothes).  I'm beginning to think this movie is suppose to be a PG-13 action-comedy not unlike ""Rush Hour"", but the studio decided to add a wacky marsupial and targeted this movie for a younger demographic; that was a bad idea.  Although, the cinematography looks nice, but then, Australia is always nice to look at.",1278979200,,3291,4.776014109347443

1869090,2,B00008YRTD,"I just read D. Eskildsen's review and realized that it says everything I wanted to say.

I'll start by saying that I was actually (shockingly) excited about this movie.  I remember taking my best friend's son to see it while he was out of town.  He was my excuse to sit through a kid's movie I wanted to see.

Neither of us really enjoyed it.

Like has been mentioned, this movie was falsely advertised (reminds me of those hilarious `Lilo and Stitch' trailers that caused us all to believe the movie would revolve around Stitch reeking havoc in a slew of Disney classics).  What we got and what we were told we were getting are two totally different things.  The kangaroo is not computer animated or zany or entertaining.  He is just a kangaroo in a red jacket.  The plot is generic and predictable (and clichd to a serious fault) and the acting is hit and miss to the extreme.  I've never been a fan of Jerry O'Connell (he's about as interesting as Keanu Reeves) and he doesn't change my mind with this mess either.

Yes, Estella Warren is hot and Anthony Anderson is mildly funny (he's much better in other films) but neither of them can save this wreckage.

I didn't find it offensive to be honest.  The scenes that have been mentioned as inappropriate aren't any more extreme than a lot of things found in most kid's films today.  Not that that is a good thing, but whatever; it's to be expected (kid's think that poop is funny).

Regardless, the film isn't really going to appeal to kids anyways; it's far too boring and uneventful.",1273190400,,1538,4.501805054151625

1869187,1,B00008YRTD,"Simply put, Kangaroo Jack was awful.  I'll keep this review brief, because so much has already been said about the film, but here are my reasons for hating it so profusely:

1) It was advertised as a talking animal movie (or at least, this was implied by the ads).  The only scene in which the ""Kangaroo Jack"" talks is a very brief one in which one of the characters is hallucinating.  KANGAROO JACK IS A COMPLETELY NORMAL KANGAROO IN THE REST OF THE FILM.

2) It has one of the weakest plots ever, and not enough action/jokes/anything to compensate for it.  Seriously, this movie is BORING.  The only interesting scenes involve Estella Warren, and they're only interesting because she's hot.

3) The jokes simply aren't funny.  A twelve-year-old might chuckle at one or two of them; anyone else will likely rip out their ears and scream.

4) Although kids might laugh at the movie's pathetic jokes, the film really isn't even appropriate for children.  There's too much crude and sexual humor: from the scene where passengers on an airplane mistakenly think the main characters are playing with poop in the airplane bathroom to the scene where Charlie squeezes one of Jessie's (clothed) breasts.

But the bottom line is that the movie is stupid and boring.  Hooray!",1123459200,14,1266,4.805555555555555
1869188,5,B00008YRTD,"Few films have been as deeply misunderstood or wrongly criticized as the 2003 film, Kangaroo Jack.  I feel that the inordinate amount of hostility directed at the film stems from a fundamental underestimation of the scope of vision.  To fully appreciate the film, one must first look past its imputed status as a ""children's film"" and evaluate it as it really is: a complicated morality tale, a profound meditation on the futility of desire and the dehumanization inherent in trying to maintain an subjective identity within a capitalist system.

The basic outline of the story is that a mob boss (played by Christopher Walken) charges his stepson and his stepson's friend with delivering $50,000 to a man in the Australian Outback.  The main thrust of the plot is set into motion when the two protagonists, Charlie and Louis, place a red sweater containing the money on a kangaroo in the desert, and the kangaroo hops off into the desert, forcing the two young protagonists to chase after it.  Even early in the movie, a careful viewer can already perceive that a complex iconography is created with great economy and precision.  It is important to note that the bright red sweater is not only invested with the protagonist's $50,000, but also has the place name of ""Brooklyn"" scrawled across its front.  Clothes have been a classic means of symbolizing an identity within a role; the sweatshirt with both the place name of Brooklyn and the $50,000 thus becomes a representation of the competing, conflicting, and irreconcilable roles that we as agents within a capitalist system must perform.  The movie explores the impossibility of attempting to preserve both a localized identity based on regional loyalties (i.e. ""Brooklyn) when we are also compelled to assume an identity as a facilitator of international capitalist transactions (i.e. the $50,000).  The kangaroo is thus transmuted from bad CGI animation into a poignant symbol of the alienated self in pursuit of its own alienated psychic elements.

In addition to this theme of the fragmentation of the self when viewed through the prism of a capitalist system of valuation, there is the equally important motif of articulation and communication.  Many have critiqued the dialogue as appalling and have brought into question whether the English language is redeemable after what it is subjected to in this film.  Indeed, such verbal `gems' as, ""I put the money in the jacket, and the jacket on the kangaroo, and now he's hopping away!"", would suggest that this film is either the work of an amateur or a person who sold out his artistic ideals long ago.  I would like to reevaluate the grounds for such harsh criticism.  When each of the earthy and unsophisticated lines is viewed holistically and in the context of the film as a totality, it becomes obvious there is a masterful command of screenwriting at work.  The painfully insipid dialogue between the human characters is no doubt intentional.  The infantile dialogue is meant to coincide with and emphasize the debasement and degradation of Charlie and Louis.  This is to say, in their feverish and fanatical pursuit of the money, Charlie and Louis become slaves to their own desires.  At the height of their frenzy, Charlie has a hallucination that the kangaroo is mocking him with a spirited rap.  This is the most powerful metaphor of the screenwriter's tragic vision.  It is the culmination of a long trajectory that reverses traditional expectations: Charlie and Louis, in fanatical pursuit of the kangaroo's money, have ensured their descent from civilization by forfeiting what makes them rational and civilized; in other words, they have become beasts.  In contrast to this, the kangaroo, their quarry, is endowed with speech, the traditional cornerstone of human culture.  Empowered with verbal communication, the kangaroo, the animal, is given agency to articulate the bestial and subhuman mentalities of the two protagonists.  Truly, this scene moves one to terror and pity as the dialectic between man and beast, subject and object, huntsman and quarry becomes obscured, even obliterated.",1121731200,6,4117,5.111940298507463

I remember watching the trailer for this thing in some moviehouse in a midwestern town: there I was, chuckling at the mob-heavy introduction, giggling at the wicked Christopher Walken (who does his Christopher Walken baleful-glare-and-purr thing as New York mob boss Sal Maggio)---and suddenly there was a talking, rapping, Ray-Ban wearing kangaroo on the screen. Because my youth slumbers fitfully, and because this Gentle Reviewer misspent said youth (and possibly, when heavily blasted, *saw* rapping Kangaroos back in the Day), I vowed I would never see this deranged flick.

Thank God for HBO! The other morning---or rather, late afternoon---I staggered home, reeling from a night of depravity and debauchery, and stumbled into the huge comfy lounging chair in front of my TV. I watched the last few minutes of a thoroughly wholesome flick about jewel thieves. Then, to my horror, the announcement: next up was ""Kangaroo Jack"". My body was dead. I couldn't move. It was either get up and grab the remote (a big No-No) or watch helplessly. I chose the latter.

Surprise! ""Kangaroo Jack"" is the most infernal of inventions, a true harbinger of the Apocalypse and a sign of the End of Days. Having watched it---twice, now---I am convinced that the Antichrist walks among us, not as some blabbering high-profile Prince or Politician, but as some anonymous Suit at Warner Brothers, giggling insanely as he greenlights tools of the Devil like ""Kangaroo Jack"". Or possibly the Antichrist is Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced this affront to humanity.

But everything said, like most infernal devices spat forth from the Hellpit, ""Kangaroo Jack"" works. It's inventive. Sparklingly shot with a high degree of aplomb. And look, it works because it conforms to the ancient writings of Aristotle, who in his essay On Comedy listed the four essential elements integral to classic comedic form. They are:

1) Midgets hitting each other with sticks;

2) Anything involving Chris Farley;

3) Big fat men with poor hygiene falling down;

4) A variation on #3: a big fat man with poor hygiene falling down PAIRED with a skinny, serious, ""straight guy"" who serves as foil to the big fat dude; both are menaced by a) gangsters; b) classic movie monsters; c) anthropomorphic animals;

Happily, ""Kangaroo Jack"", like a great Chinese dinner, serves up a little #3 and #4 (I can't remember if there was a midget in here. Maybe). Jerry O'Connell plays the straight guy Charlie Carbone, a hairdresser with mob relations who unwittingly leads the cops right to the Mob's local Manhattan warehouse. Bad move. Anthony Anderson plays his best buddy Louis, and plays the fat guy with bad hygiene to O'Connell's straight guy. Basically, Anderson is Costello. What works here is that the two have remarkably good comedic timing: they're funny. Yeah, O'Connell sometimes shoots past funny and into goofy, but Anderson's schtick is impeccable. That counts for a lot.

Mob Boss Sal (Walken) dispatches the two to Australia, to deliver a package (which Louis opens, and which contains 50 grand)to a mysterious Aussie known only as ""Mr. Smith"" (Marton Csokas, who thinks he's in ""The Limey"". He's not). Naturally they're doomed. The two hire a landrover, go bouncing over the sand, scream ""Land Down Under"" (Hades?) at the top of their lungs, and hit a kangaroo.

Now here's where the movie shows its hand as an agent of Hell: what do our two Disney heroes, in this ""family"" flick, do with the roadkill? They dress it up in Louis's lucky jacket and shades, and take pictures.

That's what I call blindsiding bored, naive parents and burrowing right into that slumbering pineal gland of pure evil every 7-year-old possesses. Guess what you do when you hit a cat, Little Johnny? Yeah, you play dress-up and have a tea party! Brilliant.

Fatality! The Kangaroo, christened ""Jackie Legs"", isn't totally dead; he gets up, opens up a can of marsupial whup-a** on O'Connell, and takes off into the Outback---carrying the 50 grand in the envelope. The movie just gets more insane from there.

It's enjoyable stuff. It's funny. I laughed. I showed it to my dour, scowling, wicked former Marine drill instructor father, who laughs at absolutely nothing in this life---and he was sniggering. The kangaroo is absolutely adorable when it isn't talking and rapping (and note: the kangaroo raps to O'Connell when he's hallucinating from starvation and thirst---much like the Devil did to St. Anthony in the wilderness. Hmmm). Estella Warren, who plays an American expatriate big into animal husbandry, is 13 stripes and 50 stars of hotness. Rowrrr.

Camera-work by Peter Menzies Junior is just as slick as it needs to be. The kangaroo is fun to watch: frankly, I could have sat back an enjoyed 90 minutes of the funky marsupial rodent galumphing across the Outback. Did I mention Warren is hot? Walken is in this movie---a kid's movie! Walken, who never appears on screen unless he's about to kill someone. Director David McNally has directed only one other movie: ""Coyote Ugly"". I rest my case.

A word of caution, though: while you simply *must* buy the full DVD (if only to enjoy the feature ""Behind the Gas""---about synthetic camel flatulence), if you have young children you must absolutely ensure that they don't try to emulate the hideous child dancer going through the motions on ""Jackie Leg's Dance Grooves"". Warn them: this is not cool. This is the Devil's work. Showing off Jackie Leg's dance grooves at school will get them beaten and laughed at. Then again, perhaps this is Bruckheimer---and Satan's---will.

G'day, Mate.

First off, is this a real kangaroo appearing in the movie, or a puppet? And what kind is it (tree-kangaroo, red-kangaroo, etc.)?

Most importantly, do you actually get to see the kangaroo get punched? I know they are known for their boxing skills, and I need to know if we get to see someone lay into the kangaroo or not. If not then I'm not so sure I want to get it. If it DOES, then where does the guy punch him (face, chest, groin, neck, etc,)? And please tell me what kind of punch, please (hay-maker, straight-punch, round-house, upper-cut, etc.) and also if it is full-force or looks fake. And if so, also, what happens to it (knocked-out cold, injured, un-phased, etc.)?

Third, I heard the kangaroo raps in the movie. Now I need to know if it is any good or not (amazing, just-ok, terrible, etc.). And also, what rap-band does he sound like (2-pac, Ice-Cube, Baha-Men, etc.)?

In conclusion, if this movie is how I imagine it, then it will be sooooo good. You always see kangaroos with boxing gloves punching things, but you never get to see one get a taste of it's own medicine. And no, this is NOT a joke. Come on guys! Hurry up and let me know! I'm keeping my fingers crossed. Later.

Christopher Walken as mob boss Sal, Anthony Anderson as Louis, as well as the Australian actor who plays the old bush pilot, and of course the kangaroo provide lots of laughs.  The script is so funny.  Among the best lines are when Sal is trying to expand his vocabulary.

This comedy is very much like one of the ""Road To"" pictures, with the two main characters playing Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.  The soundtrack is bouncy and fun, too.

KJ has a very sensual scene in the desert which did not have to be there. To me, it detracts from the goodness of the movie. There is one hilarious scene in which Louis, overweight and blubbery, farts really loud and long. But there are other funny moments too.

This film is a very new approach to comedy. You don't get the cliched formula of most buddy films. Unlike other actors who've tackled the buddy films, ( Eddie Murphy & Owen Wilson, Chris Tucker & Charlie Sheen, Skeet Ulrich & Cuba Gooding Jr. ), Anthony Anderson and Jerry O'Connell are the only two I've seen with TRUE chemistry since the good old days of Pryer and Wilder. Both actors are hilarious in their roles. There are a few plot holes when it comes to the criminals in the end but this film is so entertaining you won't care if it gets a little unbelievable.

1869246,2,B00008YRTD,"No fun, I say, probably even for kids, for the plot is not simple and the situation is too labored.  New York city hairstylist Jerry O'Connell and his buddy Anthony Anderson get in trouble when they accidentally caused a big financial damage to the local mobster (and Jerry's step-father) Christopher Walken.  Walken (who obviously does not read script before signing contract), orders the two bumbling Americans to deliver a bag of $50,000 to Australia.
Now, they arrive at Sydney, but soon loses the money in the most ridiculous and incredible way -- a kangaroo wearing a red jacket that contains the envelope runs away in the middle of the deserts!  In the meanwhile, unknown to them, gangsters are also sent there to follow Jerry and Anthony, possibly to get rid of them.
The cartoonish idea of two adults chasing the hopping kangaroo is not a bad one, but there is no fun in the chase scenes which are shot like an action movie.  Such classic cartoons featuring Road Runner or Willy O Coyote are far superior and ingenious, and the director David McNally (of, incidentaly, the ordinary drama ""Coyote Ugly"" fame) should have learned a thing or two from these masterpieces.
I see nothing great in actors; they are just OK.  Jerry O'Connell looks better than in cult comedy ""Tomcats"" and Anderson is always fun to watch even though his character (and Jerry's too) tend to scream to each other (like ten times) without particular meaning.  Thankfully, Oscar winner (yes, he was, in ""Deerhunter"") Christopher Walken fare better simply because his role is small, and you get lovely Estella Warren and her swimming in the water (in the middle of Australia, right?) is eye candy for adults.
As is often the case with Bruckheimer films, the film is costly, and you can feel it everywhere.  The city of ""New York"" is actually made in Sidney with the yellow cabs brought to the place for that purpose only, and ""Kangaroo Jack"" is convincingly made when he (and his pals) speak in rap music.  But the awfully insipid and uninspired gags and actions are boring to me, and the character actors like Bill Hunter or Marton Csokas are painfully wasted.",1083283200,,2140,4.796195652173913

This hits the top of the laugh meter!
Great family fun for all ages over 5!
Don't pay any attention to the Amazon.com Editorial Review.  The movie is very clever and worthwhile if you like slapstick.
Summary:
A quick paced action comedy about a modern Abbott (Charlie - Jerry O'Connell) and Costello (Louis - Anthony Anderson) duet who bumble themselves from Brooklyn to Australia to deliver $50,000 of mob money - not knowing it's a one way trip!
Good quick script dialog and action keeps the movie going with no slow period.
O'Connell and Anderson really have great on-screen comedic chemistry.  I have to believe they will be doing a lot more together.
Story:
Of course, these two city-slicker bumbler best friends lose $50,000 in a jacket now worn by a kangaroo, have two sets of mobsters who want to finish them off, and are ""fish-out-of-water"" lost in the outback trying to find Kangaroo Jack with the help of a beautiful and charming naturalist (Estella Warren).
Laugh-o-meter:
Off the charts!
My handicapped daughter Rebecca still splits her sides watching this one!  She loves it at night after her homework, at the clinic during her therapies, and any other time she can get it!  And, the slapstick is still funny!
Rebecca is exceptionally clever with a good mature slapstick sense of humor - even if she's only 8!
Our other kids really liked the movie too!

There is potty humor here... but it is in the Australian vernacular that kids cannot understand.  The violence is really slapstick kind of stuff, even though the main protagonists are in mortal danger.  No one gets shot, but there are a couple of punches thrown.",1076803200,3,1646,4.798586572438163

1869249,1,B00008YRTD,"The main problem with Kangaroo Jack is the fact that it is trying to be too many things at once,but fails to succeed in one.
It is trying to be an action movie:
As a Jerry Bruckheimer produced film,you would expect the ubiquitous action/chases/wreckage and surely, not to disappoint,there is only one scene in the first half of the movie,but it does seem unnecessary and over the top, Bad Boys it is not.
It is trying to be a comedy:
A mobster comedy to be more specific, but it fails not only because this subject has been filmed to excess, and much better at that(Analyze This/That, Wise Guys, Midnight Run etc..),but also because funny dialogues are really few and far in between.
It is trying to be an animal movie:
The digital kangaroo is just not 'cute'! If you expect talking animals as in the 'family fun' and surreal Dr Doolittle, or a sweet nice animal movie  as in Paulie,you will be disappointed.
Digital technology has undoubtedly boosted movie making to a great extent, but I felt that in Kangaroo Jack this technology was used just for its sake, and not to help/enhance the plot/script.
It is trying to be a family movie:
The presence of the gorgeous Estella Warren, miscat as this wildlife rescuer in the Australian outback,  had more 'dads' in mind than 'offsprings'.
It is trying to lure viewers with Chris Walken:
I was wondering what on earth such a fine actor was doing here? The only explanation I could come up with was that this film looked much better on paper.
It is trying to take advantage of the location:
Australia as a location and culture is a source that is still largely untapped in American movies. But while Crocodile Dundee was the funniest in using 'Down Under' as a source for many laughs,Kangaroo Jack is riddled with unfunny and at times annoying cliches about the country.

Back then we had great stories with cheap special effects (e.g., ""The Thing from Another World"" and ""Them!""), but now we have movies with great special effects and lousy scripts.  The title character of ""Kangaroo Jack"" is no E.T., but he sure has Jar-Jar Binks beat big time.  If the kangaroo is not your favorite character in this film then you are probably a male between the ages of 13 and 23 who found Estella Warren to be particularly cute.
The plot of the film is an update of the class screwball comedy ""Bringing Up Baby,"" that is if you turned George from a dog into a kangaroo, changed the interclaster clavical of a dinosaur to $50,000 of mob money, left Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant alone in their graves and replaced them with Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson, and moved the whole thing to Australia with explicit references to ""Crocodile Dundee"" in case the audience does not get the point, which, I suppose is possible.  Not that I think the people who made this movie saw ""Bringing Up Baby,"" but I saw the connection and if other people do too then they can go rent that movie because it is, as mentioned previously, a classic screwball comedy.
Kids are going to like ""Kangaroo Jack"" as long as the kangaroo is on screen, even if he is a little tiny fast moving figure off in the distance.

1869369,1,B00008YRTD,"It completely eludes me why this piece of (edited for innappropriate content) known as ""Kangaroo Jack"" made it to number 1 at the box office. This is by far one of the worst movies that I've seen in years, if not in my entire life!
Everyone character is unbelievably stupid and the plot is just unbelievably abominable. This movie is a complete and burning pile of sheer [edited for innappropriate content] on virtually all fronts.
What really made me fume with anger was not simply the fact that a stupid and abominable movie went to number one at the box office but the charachters laugh at someone who came down with an epileptic seizure!! How dare they make jokes out of epileptic people!! Epileptic episodes are not a pretty sight at all and I am appalled that a number 1 movie would actually make a comedic joke out of such handicaps. How dare they!!
This movie was rated PG but this movie deserves a PG 13 rating because of the heavier content than what you'd see on a PG movie.
Stay as far away from this [edited for innappropriate content] as possible. I just hope that VHSs and DVDs are recyclable.",1047513600,4,1108,4.517412935323383

1869371,5,B00008YRTD,I loved Kangaroo Jack. It's like one of those movies that everyone loves. I really liked Jack rappin it was soo cool. And I think this movie deserves 5 stars.,1045180800,,158,4.3
1869372,4,B00008YRTD,"The 4 stars are what a kid would rate this, not an adult. This was a charming movie for the apporpriate audience: about 8-14 year-olds. The movie starts a little slow (the kids are waiting to see the kangaroo!) but will ultimately grab their attention. There are a couple of non-graphic sexual comments or scenes that made me a little uncomfortable for my kids, but nothing too out of line, (one of the characters thinks he is seeing a mirage and fondles Estella Warrens' chest, and later there is a waterfall scene, neither were way out of line, but a little unnecessary. The Dad's will like it though.)There is also some fighting and violence, and a drinking scene in a bar that made me suggest that the movie may be inappropriate for younger kids. Having said that, my 4-year old thought this was a great movie. The story is reasonable, a little predictable for adults perhaps but children will be able to follow and laugh. There is the mandatory fart humor (it won't be a kids movie without someone or something cracking off a couple of loud ones), the kangaroo looked very real, and yes, he does do some rap and a little talking. The rest of the humor leaned toward slapstick, so leave Mom at home and have Dad take the crowd. I (as the responsible parent) stayed awake the whole time.",1044835200,7,1290,4.540772532188841
1869373,1,B00008YRTD,"If you're hoping for a movie about a TALKING kangaroo who also likes to rap, you're in for a big let down. In fact, he does not speak in the movie at all. That's right folks. I don't know what they were thinking. Was it too unrealistic? Maybe. But in a film like this who really cares about why a kangaroo would talk in the first place. It was supposed to be a ... of last years Scooby Doo, which was also horrible, but ended up making big business at the box office. It seems trailers have gone from showing you too much of a movie to showing you stuff that isn't in the movie at all. I don't know about you, but to me that's not getting what you pay for.
Don't be complacent. Please complain.",1043539200,8,694,4.072992700729927
1869374,4,B00008YRTD,"The Kangaroo sold me in the commercials. So did Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson, so I gave the movie a chance. It payed off. This movie was adorable, good clean fun. Besides the camel flatulence and one other racy joke, the PG rating is totally appropriate. Kids should really enjoy this, and for adults, the two stars should hold their attention. And the Kangaroo... well he's fun for everybody to look at.",1043452800,12,412,4.736111111111111

""HAHAHAHA! SHE HAS EPILEPSY!!!""
... I mean, really. Is that funny?
I guess I just think it's a cheap shot against people who already have enough problems.",1043366400,,298,4.339285714285714
