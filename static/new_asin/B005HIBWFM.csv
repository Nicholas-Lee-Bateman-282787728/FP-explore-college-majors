4699907,3,B005HIBWFM,Standard fare for film moir the kind of thing you would watch on the late show in the sixties anx early seventies. A good waste of time.,1424476800,,136,4.074074074074074
4699908,3,B005HIBWFM,"Not a bad movie for those who like the old-time cop/thriller movies. It's pretty obvious where it's going to end up, but the plot has enough twists to keep in entertaining.",1419552000,,172,4.580645161290323
4699909,4,B005HIBWFM,"In CAGE OF EVIL, a police detective named Scott Harper (Ron Foster) investigates a big diamond heist that also includes a murder. As Harper delves deeper into the case, he becomes romantically entangled w/ Holly Taylor (Patricia Blair), the girlfriend of one of the thieves. Meanwhile, Harper is also passed over for a promotion, causing him to become angry and bitter. Trouble ensues. Harper ends up having to make a difficult choice. One that could hurl him headlong into inescapable darkness. CAGE is a solid crime drama w/ a noir-ish atmosphere. For lovers of hard-boiled detective stories...",1417824000,,596,5.154639175257732
4699910,3,B005HIBWFM,"Made on what was clearly a miniscule budget, ""Cage of Evil"" is a reasonably effective noir drama that plays a little bit like a college production of ""Double Indemnity.""  A good but hot-headed cop, played by Ronald Foster, is repeatedly passed up for promotion, so when he's assigned to a case involving a femme fatale (Patricia Blair) and a quarter-million-dollars' worth of stolen diamonds, his previously well-established path on the straight and narrow begins to wash away.  Soon he's up to his neck in murders, even as the department continues to believe him a hero (and finally gives him that promotion to lieutenant).  By then, though, his only option is to try and escape with the doll and the ice.  Foster is all right, and Pat Blair (as she's billed) is lovely and certainly tries hard, but she simply isn't femme fatale material.  Perhaps the biggest problem with ""Cage of Evil"" is there's no real sense of danger.  Neither the acting nor direction from the protean Edward L. Cahn can convince the audience that these people are truly trapped in the ""cage"" of their own making (at least I think that's why it's called ""Cage of Evil"").  Things pick up a bit toward the end, when it becomes a more of a cat-and-mouse game in which Foster has to continually use his cop-wits and training to try and elude his own buddies in the department.  Much of the film was shot on location, and it's always interesting to see what L.A. looked like back when.  ""Cage of Evil"" holds one's attention, but except for a couple suggestive double-entendres, it could have been a television film of the time.",1360972800,4,1597,4.715827338129497
4699911,2,B005HIBWFM,A two star period piece from the 60's. A bit 'formulaic'. The acting : 'not ready for prime time'.,1456876800,,98,4.2105263157894735

4699915,3,B005HIBWFM,"This movie was pretty good and stayed true to the film noir genre.  If you like that kind of movie, and I do, you'll probably enjoy this one.",1442448000,,141,4.035714285714286
4699916,3,B005HIBWFM,"This reminds me of a less competent Double Indemnity.  Instead of an insurance man plotting the perfect insurance scam, here we have a cop planning the perfect heist.  Unfortunately, this movie lacked the excellent acting and incredible dialogue of its inspiration.  Ultimately, it is just a rainy day ""B"" movie.",1437177600,,312,5.2
4699917,3,B005HIBWFM,It was O.K. It held my interest and had a satisfying ending. But it probably won't be one that I will watch again.,1435276800,,114,4.0

4699920,4,B005HIBWFM,"One cannot assess these lesser-known films positively without understanding the era. One could easily dismiss this as a cheap production simply because its old. I think this is much better than most give it credit. Yes, its a tired premise, but Zenith Pictures pulls together a pretty authentic story. Ron Foster stars in another Robert Kent Production, again with co-star, Harp McGuire. Told through the eyes of his superior, played by John Maxwell, it tells the last assignment of a young officer, Foster. Its a tidy story with enough suspense to keep you locked in. However, Maxwells high, somewhat lackadaisical narration is a better fit for an old MGM cartoon. The title film score does not fit this movie, either, sounding more like a light comedy film which includes dance numbers. Sawtell does fine work, but Tiomkin is what you want here. Look for a young Ted Knight and Henry Darrow near the end.",1427587200,4,906,4.8896103896103895
