Sadly, i was a little bit disappointed. i only give it 3 stars eventhough i enjoyed watching it, but after a while, it gets a lil bit boring. The storyline is just okay. Comedy wise its pretty hilarious but it lacks intensity of a good story.
This is not bad to watch but it certainly not the best.",1195516800,,395,4.28
8067967,4,B0009WDVTG,Kim Rae Won is a very good actor. but the rest are just not in his calibre. they should have used some one better to play the lead actress and the guy who plays her boss couldn't act at all. But still if you are Kim rae won's fan this is still a good show to watch.  I think the best one so far is love story in harvard with kim tae hee ( stairway to heaven)who  plays the lead roll opposite him.,1188345600,,396,3.7590361445783134
8067968,5,B0009WDVTG,"As a relative new-comer to Korean drama, I was immediately attracted and became drawn to this show. I had seen only a few episodes on TV, and was never able to see the whole thing, so I felt compelled to buy it. The antics of Jung-Eun and Kyung-Min and their families during their seemingly star-crossed relationship entertained me completely.

Simply put, Rooftop Room Cat is a welcome relief from today's sex-filled, profanity-ridden, insult-slinging shows and made made me feel good.",1122163200,9,486,5.075
8067969,5,B0009WDVTG,"Kyung Min is an immature, self-centered law student who meets Jung Eun, an innocent hard working woman just out of high school. What transpires over the next 16 hours is pure magic. Kim Rae-won is great as Kyung Min and Jung Da-bin is perfect as Jung Eun. This is a love story with many ups and downs which is enhanced by perceptive writing, beautiful and quirky music and Jung Da-bin's heart and soul performance. She creates an emotional impact which lasts long after the last episode. Don't miss this wonderful DVD set and get the soundtrack if you can particularly for track #2. A wonderful and memorable production.",1121644800,8,620,4.75
