3456649,4,B0000AGTNO,"First, the reason I did not give it five stars coincides with what the other person posted. The tape is horrible quality and very short but after once you really don't need it anyway, and I can see how the rings could possibly start to hurt your arms after a while, but they haven't put me in any pain yet (except for my arms burning as they are toning, of course).<br />
<br />
I also have been faced with the challenge of keeping the rings near my wrists, or even my lower arms. They always seem to migrate to my upper arms until they beat me in the head (again, this does not hurt...yet). I'm sure with time I will master the art of keeping the rings in the proper place.<br />
<br />
Overall, I am very pleased with this product. You can feel it working even after the first short session with the tape, and if you keep it up and even extend your workout beyond that tape, I'm certain you will see results. The stretches are very effective, too. It seems like an easy thing to stick with, even for an excercise-phobic person like me.",1104192000,3,1037,4.21608040201005
3456650,4,B0000AGTNO,"I am new to Pilates exercise and this kit looked just the thing when I picked it up at a sports store the other week.  It has a beginners' video, one of those stretchy bands, two shaped pillows and a foam block - mine were all done in a nice designer shade of lavender.  It does not have the mat as the picture implies on the cover.

Now although I had never tried Pilates before I did have some body conditioning due to aerobic exercises.  I had no trouble performing the pilates moves once I knew what I was doing, but on the video there is an assistant instructor who is performing easier versions of them if the viewer finds them to be too difficult for their fitness level.  One hint:  if you are in very weak physical condition, you will need the pillows, but others may not (I only used the neck pillow briefly during one exercise).  On the other hand, I found that the instructor, Jillian Hessel, went a little quickly for me to both learn how to position myself correctly and complete the set of exercises the first time around; I did get lost several times, but after following along for a few workouts I was able to keep up.  My advice to other beginners is to be persistent -- expect to have to practice several times before you ""get it"" completely.

When the first workout was over I felt disappointed, as if I didn't get a very thorough working out in the 35 minutes I spent on the mat.  This workout certainly didn't elevate my heart rate or cause me to break a sweat.  Then as I moved around during the day performing house and garden chores that required a lot of bending, reaching, and general body movements I realized that I felt physically ""looser"" and energized.  It must have been doing something right.  The next day I noticed the telltale soreness in my abdominals that told me they had been worked harder than I'd known.  No other muscle groups seemed to have been worked out very well, however.  So although this is a good introduction to the fundamentals of Pilates exercises, I can't recommend it for a total body workout, at least not to people who have some small level of physical conditioning already.  BUT....it may be just the thing for people starting out from ""rock bottom"".

8278469,5,B0000AGTNO,"This was my second purchase of this system.  Along with cardio and diet, Winsor Pilates has helped me go from a size 16 to a toned size 8 in about 6 months, 35lbs., and I'm still losing and firming.  Long, lean muscles.  What I love about this series, is even after doing it for months, I'm still able to challenge myself by pushing my body harder.  I also do some of Shaun T's ab workouts, and my abs burn more after a few of the videos on this series.  20-25 minute videos.  Easy to do daily.  I bought a second set because my husband used to joke about me doing pilates.  He's athletic, muscular and has no issues with his weight.  He tried Cardio Sculpt with me one time and it kicked his butt!  I had to get him his own resistance cords and now we do Winsor Pilates together every day.  He's getting even more defined.

8278471,3,B0000AGTNO,"First of all, I have a sensitivity to Latex and the weighted bar contains it. It has an unpleasant smell that stays on your hands even after washing.

I was not crazy about the workouts. Instead of the moves/exercizes being different, they are very similar. I liked the old Winsor Pilates set of DVD's.",1339286400,3,302,4.592592592592593
8278472,4,B0000AGTNO,"I'll admit I'm a junkie when it comes to fitness gadgets.  Anything promising quick results and little effort.  This is one of the first products that actually delivers.

I have used the arm rings for 8-10 minutes every evening while watching TV for just over one week.  My arms feel firmer and look more toned.

When I first came home with the product my husband laughed at me, and said I could just do the arm motion without the rings and get the same results.  I disagree, I think the circles force you to be still and hold your core muscles.  If you do the movements while standing on your toes (which is more difficult) you can feel your center tighten.

The other day my skeptical husband commented that my arms are looking more 'buff' and 'lean' so that is enough for me.  I had him measure my arms and in a few weeks I'll have him measure them again to see if I've lost any circumference.  But I'm happy that I just look more toned.  It's a good product, and you can easily watch the video or DVD once and toss it, you really only need to watch it once or have the concept explained to you, it's not hard.  The results are GREAT!",1121212800,2,1137,4.2372093023255815
