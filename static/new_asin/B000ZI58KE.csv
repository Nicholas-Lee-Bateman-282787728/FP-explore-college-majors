The whole country was well covered and I really enjoyed the section on Tibet as well as Shanghai.  I hope to visit this beautiful country some day, and will use this video as my reference guide.",1226016000,10,320,5.0

locations & photography are good but not all inclusive. The commentary is sometimes a little hard to understand, and in a few instances is a bit heavy handed.
Nevertheless the subject matter is very interesting, and well worth watching.",1200700800,5,287,5.127659574468085
3041729,5,B000ZI58KE,"I enjoyed this DVD because it showed me all of China including Tibet. Also I could take some Chinese lessons. If you see this DVD, you will really want to see cute pandas in China!!",1200441600,5,181,4.2
3041730,5,B000ZI58KE,I really enjoyed this DVD.  The mix of traditional Chinese cultural sites in Beijing and Xian and the ultra-modern skyline in Shanghai were fascinating.,1197676800,10,152,5.333333333333333

3041732,3,B000ZI58KE,"Its some guy's home movies from his trip to China. Better than I could have done, but definitely not professional by any means.

He hits some of the highlights of a few major cities. He also highlights some pretty obscure or insignificant things along the way. Obviously things he just stumbled upon.

His voice is SUPER annoying. The music is SUPER annoying.

It's ok...worth about a dollar and an hour of your time.",1363737600,,417,4.684931506849315
3041733,1,B000ZI58KE,"I don't know why it had so many 5 star ratings on it, the video itself is actually pretty awful and the narrator is kind of obnoxious.

EDIT:

Have you noticed that most of the people who gave 5 stars to this video apparently only reviewed a few other similar travel videos that appear to be made from the same people as the ones who created this video? Not to mention that most of them aren't actually ""verified"" purchasers?

I can't help but wonder if the people who made this video created a bunch of fake accounts so they can get the ratings for this video up.

Make no mistake, though, this video is awful and not worth your money in the least.",1358985600,,649,4.252032520325203
3041734,2,B000ZI58KE,"This video looks like it was compiled by shots from the 80's. Low quality video, annoying music playing non-stop, and the narrator was really difficult to pay attention to, as his voice was rather grating and reminds me of children's educational shows from decades ago. I suppose I was expecting a BBC production and got, well, a video that offers very little insight to China as it really is, through a video that does not, at all, seem like it was from 2007.",1348790400,,460,4.554216867469879
3041735,5,B000ZI58KE,"Very well presented video with great graphics. It highligted the best of China and provided brief descriptions of what to see and do.  It included ""off the beaten track"" information, like the caves in Guilin and the lighted tunnel ride in Shanghai.  It was very helpful for planning my visit and prioritizing what do see and do in the time I had.  I had seen other videos, but this was most helpful from a tourist perspective.

3041737,5,B000ZI58KE,"The price is right.  The narrator sounds like someone who was there and made the video - not some professional voice over.

With China being so important to the USA and my grandchildren - this a good training experience for them and others like them.",1289779200,4,250,4.533333333333333
3041738,2,B000ZI58KE,"The first thing wrong with this dvd is the narration; it's terrible.  The narrator's voice is shrill, abrupt, and his speaking style is very disjointed; he inserts breaks in sentences where they don't belong and elongates words for effect.  ""The Chiiing dynasty...""  ""There were expensive chandeliers.  Posh.  Hotels.  With wood paneled ceilings.""  I half expected him to say ""Let's. Get. Ready.  To. Ruuuuummblllle!""

I also could have done without seeing the exterior and interior of a Wal-Mart in China.  They spent almost as much time on Wal-Mart as they did the Forbidden City.

At the end of the main video there is a rapid-fire section with some words and phrases, but they aren't shown on the screen so it's a little confusing.

The narrator speaks of additional videos at the end, on both pandas and the Forbidden City, but they are simply built in 2 minute segments.  The one on the Forbidden City is the same footage from the main section of the dvd with a tiny bit more added; there are almost no interior shots at all.

I was looking for much more detail in a documentary and this just doesn't have it.

The scenery is nice, and there are some lovely gardens, but every aspect of it is seriously lacking in quality.  You can most likely get just as much information on You Tube or any one of the travel sites on the web.",1277856000,4,1333,4.584745762711864

I found the narrator's voice to be a little annoying at times.
