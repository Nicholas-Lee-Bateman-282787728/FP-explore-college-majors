5089776,2,B007IU8YY4,"The Forger with Josh Hutcherson and Hayden Panettiere. Rated PG-13 (though I don't know why it's not PG.  There's not much language, no sexual content, and no violence, except for a fight.  The only thing I can think of which would give it a PG-13 rating is that it deals with a teenager committing a major crime; forgery.)

  The Forger is about a young homeless boy, Joshua, who just happens to be a painting prodigy.  He breaks into houses to get food, clothes, and an occasional night's sleep if the homeowner is not there.  He has a compulsion to paint.  One of the opening scenes is him painting the ceiling of the hotel room his mother abandoned him in.

  Joshua breaks into the home of a renowned artist, Everly, to get some food.  While exploring the home, he sees an unfinished picture of a turbulent sea.  He can't help but finish the painting.  After he's finished, he figures the homeowner will not be home for a while and decides to take a nap.  Everly returns home and catches Joshua.  Instead of being mad, he's intrigued by Joshua's work, and convinces the police to give him temporary custody of the boy.

  Everly turns out to be an art forger, and the painting Joshua finishes is a forgery which is convincing enough to sell for a hefty profit.  Everly enlists Joshua's talents to continue his business venture of selling forgeries.  Joshua learns all of the different techniques of painting, along with the ins and outs of producing believable forgeries.

  While living with Everly, Joshua meets another artist, Anne-Marie, whom he can relate to, and often goes to visit the older lady.  It turns out that Anne-Marie has a sordid past with Everly which is a sore subject to her.

  Joshua has a love interest, Amber, but it is an almost fill-in story, just to give the movie some sort of a romantic aspect.  It was weakly played out.

  We all know Mr. Hutcherson from The Hunger Games, but whenever I see him in anything, I think of his earlier, goofy days, like from Zathura or Bridge to Terabithia.  He seems to be the same character in all of his movies, to me.  I know, a lot of people are going to hate me for saying that, but his range is fairly limited.

  When I saw that Mrs. Panettiere was in this, I was excited.  I fell in love with her in the T.V. series Heroes, but haven't really seen any of her other films.  I was really disappointed in her role in this film.  It was non-existent, and the romance was so forced, it made the movie a little uncomfortable.

  The story-line could have been great, but I feel that the whole movie fell flat.  I don't know if it was the acting or script, but I found myself feeling very bored after the initial plot setup.

  I'd only recommend this movie if you're fairly bored, and you don't go in to it with any expectations.",1419811200,,2799,4.462301587301587

5089806,3,B007IU8YY4,"I will be blunt: on the one hand, I love the premise of this film.  And how it's about art and the positive impact the arts can have on people, as well as the possible dark side.

However, there a number of problems (I'll try to avoid too many spoilers):
- What crazy person decided to market this as a thriller?  This is definitely NOT a thriller by a long shot.  More of a coming-of-age drama about a troubled teenager.  I honestly wondered what movie I was watching at first.  Because it did not fit the description on the box at all.
- The way the other characters respond to the protagonist is too unbelievable.  Seriously, more of them should be creeped out or concerned about his anti-social behavior.  Or at least be more cautious around him.  Or fed up.  Or something.
- God.  The teen romance.  No.  Please no.  This has to be my least favorite aspect of the film.  It feels so forced and trite and stupid and unrealistic and makes me gag.  Hayden Panettiere's obnoxious, perky wholesomeness doesn't help much to boot.
- This almost feels like two storylines smashed together.  One is about art forgery.  The other is the main character's life.  I really think the screenwriter/director should have either picked one or the other.  Because they don't seem to mesh well to me.  There are too many ideas and such floating around for the running time.  We never get to explore any of them fully.
- There are a few too many loose ends that never add up.  Also, some things should have been clarified better.  When my dad saw this there was one point in particular he didn't get because of the way a scene was edited.  I had to explain it to him.
- Does not hold up well under multiple viewings.  You become more and more aware of the flaws and plot holes.

So yeah.  To be fair there are good points, too.  Lauren Bacall puts in a solid performance.  Josh Hutcherson is sympathetic as the lead.  And it's nice to see a different kind of film than the usual Hollywood fare.  But overall this is mediocre and could've been great if it had been handled differently.",1399680000,,2068,4.432

5089808,1,B007IU8YY4,"There is not a single redeeming quality to this movie.  Despite having decent actors, they all seem like they are putting on a grade school play. The story is terrible.  It has some trouble giving the characters any real motivation as they are the most terrible version of cliche.  Its not even fun to watch as a bad movie.",1388966400,,323,4.440677966101695

5089811,4,B007IU8YY4,I like the actor Josh Hutcherson but it was an added bonus to have Lauren Bacall in the movie as a main character as well. The play between the characters and the outcome is predictable but a good feel.,1379721600,,202,4.205128205128205

5089813,1,B007IU8YY4,"The title says The Forger, but in the movie this is more like an after-thought. Wandering movie not sure where it wants to go. (1) Abandoned teen boy tries to survive without a mother, (2) but he also spends considerable screen-time in teen-related scenes with a girl, and, oh, yes, there is (3) the art forgery angle that could have made this a great movie but was treated only as perhaps a third subplot. Agonizingly slow story goes in all direction and goes nowhere. The lead character, Josh, has a habit of breaking into houses and getting into fights---overall an obnoxious and irritating lead character with no clear positive values. Yet the writers of this mess want us to believe that he is redeemable because he has an art talent. Even that angle is not developed sufficiently. Lauren Bacall and Alfred Molina do a great acting job in the limited length of time they spend on the screen---two great talents essentially wasted in this sorry mess that was probably a TV-movie. Even in that genre it should have been canned. Don't waste your time on this dud.",1372118400,5,1065,4.7005347593582885

5089815,3,B007IU8YY4,"Well where to start, first off the narration in this film, well it just didn't fit into the movie, it seemed forced in. Thankfully the narration doesn't happen throughout the whole movie. The acting was good, but here again is another film that could have been a really powerful film. No scene, what so ever, made a lasting impression, or at all was powerful. But it was good, so you got great actors, check, you got a beautiful place to film, check, you got a great idea, check. So what ruined this film, well it was the script. The film was starting off at a good start, but it seems that the script writers got lazy and just wrote down anything to get this script finished. It just sucks to know that this movie could have been amazing and really powerful, but it got runied just because the writers were lazy.",1364515200,2,813,4.3907284768211925

5089831,3,B007IU8YY4,"I watched this flick the other night and was pleasantly surprised.  It had a nice score and the shots of Carmel were beautiful.  I also liked the love story tie-in with Hayden Paniettere but was hoping the movie focused more on that.  For example, Josh Hutcherson's character just eventually wins her over and her infatuation for him has nothing to do really with his talent as an art prodigy.  Something was just missing in the sparks department.  This was a direct to DVD movie so don't expect much depth in this relationship.

Overall though I think this film could have been edited better.  A lot of the scenes kinda dragged and could have been easily eliminated with proper editing.  If you have nothing else to watch on a weeknight, this may be your movie.",1354838400,,762,4.634328358208955
5089832,5,B007IU8YY4,this is a great book that holds you interest though out the entire story. I thoughly enjoyed this story and plan on looking for more by this director.,1353628800,,150,4.392857142857143
5089833,1,B007IU8YY4,"I thought this would be good since it had some known actors in it, but it was awful. I had to turn it off.  I wouldn't have watched this even if it were free!",1353024000,,158,3.6470588235294117
5089834,2,B007IU8YY4,"So this is one of those movies that slips by the public. I guess they can't have every movie in theaters. Anyway, there is some recognizable names in this one. Alfred Molina, Hayden Panetierre, and Josh Hutcherson (coming off the successful Hunger Games) lead up the cast. Also, they have that one guy who was one of the hobbits in lord of the rings. And this is how his career has turned out??

Ok, so Hutcherson is supposed to be 15 in the movie. He looks boyish enough to pull it off I guess. They are stretching it though. Panetierre is supposed to be around the same age although they hint at her being a couple years older than Hutcherson. Nevertheless, this is a pet peeve of mine. Why does Hollywood always hire actors in their 20s and 30s to be teenagers? In this case, we lucked out. Hutcherson is 19, but panetierre is 23 which is my age. In my opinion, teenage girls never looked like adults when I was in high school. Nevertheless, we continue.

So Hutcherson is a homeless teen. The typical homeless teen scenario plays out. His mom ran away and he never knew his dad. He knows the social workers more than anyone else and he has no friends. But he can draw! A local artist discovers his abilities after Hutcherson breaks into his house to make a sandwich and take a shower. Hutcherson stumbles into the basement and completes a painting the artist was working on. Then, we learn that the artist is actually a forger who wants to use the kids abilities to make money. And this could have been a really great premise for a movie which is exactly why I wanted to see it. Also, panetiere is in it to remember?

Well, hutcherson does not like that the artist is a forger. He is only slightly on board with the plan to do a couple more forgery jobs. He really just wants to skip town because I guess that is what all the homeless kids want. He carries that attitude through the whole movie and there is little redemption. A couple meaningless side stories transpire. The case worker tries to find his mom. Panetierre is sort of his friend. However, it is unclear why they would be close because he keeps hurting her every other scene. Well, she is in their to be a love interest. However, she does not have any real impact on the story. The movie is not really about art forgeries even though it is. Its about Hutcherson searching for some peace. There is no mystery or intrigue behind the forgeries. No high stakes scenes. No consequences until the end of the movie. Even then, we don't know what happens to the real forger, Molina. The movie just kind of ends and I was disappointed.",1349568000,,2594,4.422594142259414
5089835,3,B007IU8YY4,"This film is pretty good.  The acting and story is good with some people you do not see often.  Alfred Molina as always, plays a guy you just love to hate and the as usual and forever beautiful Lauren Bacall is his co-star.

5089841,3,B007IU8YY4,"Contained some spoilers

-----------------------

This movie could had easily been a 5 star movie, but it failed to do so many things. At times this movie felt like an A-movie, but at other times it felt like a B-movie. The acting, story line, and directing was really a mix of good and bad. Also, the music used was great, but it was sometimes too dramatic and messed up the movie.

For the acting, it seemed like Hayden Panetiere and Josh Hutcherson were the best in the movie. The other actors had their moments, but in other scenes failed to make the movie more realistic. So, in some scenes I was believing what they were doing and in other scenes it all just seemed way too scripted.

I find that the story was very bad at times, where it doesn't make any sense. But, the movie still goes forward even though it doesn't make sense. For example, when the case worker finds Josh's character's mother finally! She steps in and looks at the situation. The mother asks the case worker what she doing there but never answers her. The case worker saw that the mom is abusing a new small child. The case worker goes off and calls for the police. The mother is never heard from again because the case worker told Josh character she didn't find his mother. The way the story was build didn't make sense for him to care that his mom was still abusing kids. He doesn't care that he was abused, that another kid was too, or that his mom is a drug addict. He just wants to see his mom and the story doesn't let that happen. And so, the movie just moves on from that to the next so builded up scene, which was even worse than the last.

The very worse scene was the climax of the movie. This is where the audience is waiting to see if the painting being shown is real or not. The super big showing that will save Everly (art dealer), career, fortune, and life basically. Then, all of a sudden Aunt Marie (kind old artist) comes out of no where and reveals that she was a art forger before and tells people there the painting is a forgery. Her acting was terrible when she slashed up the painting and her acting was even worse when she threaten Everly. Then, the story just allowed her to do whatever with her life after that. No one stopped her after words, no police for past crimes? No angry art buyers? Not even Everly? What kind of movie is this???

Then, Josh Hutcherson character was there too and no one stopped him either or did anything bad happened to him afterwards. The very end of the movie doesn't make sense! Now Everly just lost everything!!!! He bascailly going to be living in the gutter for the rest of his life or be dead by the people that he borrowed money from, but he didn't do anything about it or was mad. He just disappeared after that. That's so crazy!!! You would think he would really want to get back at Josh character for spoling everything and basically killing him. But, no, nothing happens. Also, what happened to the $5K that he gave Josh at the end too? You don't think Everly going o want that back because he basically broke and $5 cut can still buy him some things to get out of the country, while he still can that is. So, the movie just allows Josh's character to keep the money? Man that's hard to believe.

This movie is way to nice on everyone that is good and too unrealistic for the ones that are part. Even aunt Marie was let off too easy. This movie creates a ""force happy ending"", even though, there was no way of really having one. So, it doesn't make any sense based on the events leading towards the climax and after, but everyone likes a happy ending, right? Even if it doesn't make sense on how it got there. NOT!!!

It's a so-so movie. Watch it at your own risk. But, you might find yourself thinking at the end of the movie, ""what kind of ending was that?????""",1346457600,,3808,4.316083916083916

5089852,3,B007IU8YY4,"JHutch is an artistically-talented 15-year-old boy who's mother left him. He ends up entering-but-not-breaking into the home of an artist who eventually becomes his temporary guardian and who commissions a forged painting from him.

Basically, Everly (the artist/art dealer) takes advantage of Joshua's talent and the fact that he is a kid with no place left to go. In steps Anne Marie, who DOES in fact give a care about him. Turns out that Anne Marie and Everly have a little something in common.

Then there's Amber, who Joshua decides right away he has a thing for. He befriends her and her older brother and becomes a bit possessive of her. Amber (Hayden Panieterre) doesn't have a crucial role in this film. I think they just threw her in for a romantic element.

Still confused about the little Irish guy. I'm not sure if he's supposed to be Everly's partner or his partner, partner if you catch my drift. Either way, he's a bit annoying.

Storyline was interesting enough, though I found that the movie is not nearly as dark as it is depicted in the trailer, which shows guns and plays some very dramatic music. No, it doesn't end up in a shoot-out or anything.

Anyway, this film is pretty predictable and very hurt-comforty. (JHutch cries like a champ. Prepare to have those heartstrings pulled). The acting is good, but the actual story is so-so. It was entertaining, and appropriate for younger ages (Hardly any profanity, no sex, but a bit of punching). Not a bad movie, considering.",1343174400,22,1496,4.760617760617761

5089857,5,B007IU8YY4,This a charming film. loved Bacall's performance- it has such a classic hollywood feel to it. found the mother's drug scene to be a little cartoonish but other than that what an incredible job by a first time director. The Eastwoods star in this too.,1341446400,4,250,4.5777777777777775
5089858,3,B007IU8YY4,"""People need to figure out how to find thier success."" Joshua (Hutcherson) has been abandoned by his mother in a hotel room and is on his own. After finding an open house he sneaks in for food and a bed. He stumbles on a secret room with painting supplies and his real talent is discovered by the owner (Molina) in the morning. Giving Josh a choice to stay with him in return for helping him forge paintings Josh thinks he has found his calling. Then he meets Anne-Marie (Bacall) and everything changes. This overall is not a bad movie but just a little slow. Molina and Bacall are a great choice for these roles and really helps the movie have a more legitamate feel and takes it above made for TV status. For a movie about forging paintings I do have to say that this was a really tough subject to stay interested in. For the most part I was entertained but during quite a bit of it I found myself not really caring and losing interest. Then Molina or Bacall showed up and got me back again. It seems like I'm bashing the movie, which I'm not trying to do. This movie isn't terrible just a little slow moving and hard to stay focused on. Overall, not bad but has the feel of a made for TV movie. I give it a B-.",1341273600,2,1213,4.188034188034188

8517879,3,B007IU8YY4,"Josh Hutcherson's films are not that popular as those of some other rising young stars in Hollywood these days.  His best film was Journey to the Centre of the Earth (2012) and the Hunger Games (2012) all others appear to be disappointing for one reason or another.  I suppose ""The Forger"" is worth watching if only for the fine performance of Lauren Bacall and fans of Josh Hutcherson.  Hutcherson plays a fifteen year-old but looks more like a twenty-something.  So you have to just ignore this.  The film has a descent plot that isn't boring but it could be better.  Hutcherson's character, in some attempt to act more juvenile, overdoes the temper tantrums.  He presents his character as an extremely-tallented artist who is quite intelligent.  Then allows himself to be manipulated, which only points back to being too old to be a fifteen-year-old.  The bottom line is, this film good for watching, but not one that you would come back to a few more times like ""The Maze Runner.""",1427673600,,984,4.775147928994083

Carmel was pretty though. 1 star for Carmel.

2018 update: this movie is even worse in retrospect. Everyone involved should pay me $10 each in restitution. The producers should each pay me $25 in Outback Steakhouse gift cards (I assume they work there at the host stand as theres no way they produced other films after this stinker.)",1420243200,2,512,4.389473684210526
