8683608,5,B00OHLR8GW,"This film was very entertaining, and had lots of emotional ups and downs.  The relationship between the two brothers felt very real and poignant.  I appreciated the attempt to portray the west of the 1880's, and all the promise and broken dreams that it represented to lots of people in those days. A couple of very compelling actions scenes in this too--a bank robbery, train hold-up, and ultimate shoot-out.",1432684800,3,409,4.913043478260869

8683610,2,B00OHLR8GW,"I didn't care one bit about any of these characters. if this is a true story then they should have given them some type of personality. These 3 actors should be horse whipped, with a really big horse. they just were so BLAH, I'm guessing it was because they didn't have much to work with, but I'm also thinking they and the entire supporting cast are appalling. the dialog, if you want to call it that just plods along. No emotion and no feeling. I love my westerns but this one needs to go the way of the gunslinger....dead and gone.",1423872000,3,534,4.297029702970297
