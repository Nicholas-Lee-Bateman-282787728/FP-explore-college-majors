  Yes, this DVD does destroy the misconceptions that so many of us who now live up North, are forced to live with.

3099523,4,B0012Y10HK,I found this movie to be quite accurate about the South that I live in...Northeastern Tennessee.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about our beautiful part of the country.  I would like to see more about the people of this area....as they are not all like the hillbillies that you see portrayed in movies ect.  They are polite and kind people that do a lot of volunteer work.  I moved to this area in 2000 from California. Every person that I spoke to that has moved here from another state is glad they did.

3099525,4,B0012Y10HK,"This is a concise (1 hour 40 minutes) history of the Appalachian people.  It's one part hard history, one part legend, and one part myth.  The scope is broad, starting at pre-revolutionary times when immigrants migratged West, and moving through the start of NASCAR.

It's hard to make history interesting and relevant, but this documentary does a fine job.",1220486400,2,357,5.016949152542373
3099526,5,B0012Y10HK,"I watched it on the History Channel and it was mesmerizing to me.  I was absolutely familiar with a lot of what was covered.  When I was a wee (3 to 5 yr old) child, my daddy worked on the Fontana Dam up there while we lived not far from the Cherokee Indian Reservation.  Of course I was too young at the time to remember much first hand, so this movie, while I watched it on the History Channel, gave me some background.  Such as, I did not know that the Fontana Dam was put into action by FDR to aid in making the first atomic bombs.  I remember hearing some things about the bombs, but never realized it was so near to us.  Even if I knew, it wouldn't have meant a thing to me.  The power that those bombs would take with them never entered my young mind.  I remember my parents talking about a huge devastating train wreck that happened somewhere around the Oak Ridge, Tennessee plant where other components were being manufactured.  Oak Ridge was not very far from the Fontana. I just wonder how close we came to being annihilated by that.
Another thing I didn't know was how the Fontana River was flooded and all of the homes destroyed and displaced so many people with something like a $35 payoff by the government.  What a shame!  Although, I know that $35 back then was probably like $3500 which still wouldn't compensate me for uprooting my family and watching all I had ever worked for be destroyed by my government. A lot of my family came from that area, Murphy NC and a few miles either way, and I know how they had such a struggle to make a living, because I've heard it many times. They grew and raised all of their food.  There was no driving or even walking to the grocery store.  If they didn't raise it, they didn't eat. They learned how to preserve and use every bit of food stuffs they could.  My grandmothers all could make the best saurkraut I've ever eaten.  It's totally different from any you'll ever find in a store.  They canned green beans, tomatoes, corn, and everything else they could raise.  They even figured out pickling vegetables and I'm still addicted to it.  I learned how to do it from my grandmothers and my mother-in-law, but it's such a long, dramatic thing that it's hard to get excited about it any more when we have so much other stuff in the stores.  BUT, I still make it up to the mountains, around the reservation and can still buy the saurkraut and pickled beans and corn, okra, etc from someone who has kept it going.
Most of them didn't have radios and naturally no one had any TVs, and so the war effort meant little or squat to them. All they knew was their government took their homes.  And now, my other side of the family, some being full blooded Cherokee Indians, I can't even talk about it.  They were treated worse than people treat their dogs today.  Although, none of my ancestors as far as I know, were made to go down that Trail of Tears, I still feel heartbreak for them.  Thank God, some of these wrongs are being made right today for them now.  I do remember this scene:  The Indians were allowed to come into the little town where we lived, Robbinsville, on Saturdays (and not Sunday through Friday) to buy (or barter) for the supplies that they could get and I would sit on this rock wall (that kept our house from sliding down the mountain), with them waiting for their busses to come after them to take them back to the reservation.  We got along really well.  I must've spoken some kind of ""childspeak"" to them, because I certainly didn't know their language, but maybe they knew some of mine.  I remember many times by the time their bus got there, they would have given me nickels.  I thought I was queen of something.  I just loved them.  At the time I didn't know I was partly one of them.  I'm proud of that heritage.  That was their land in the very beginning, and look what we did to them.  My little great grandmother who was full blooded Cherokee never mentioned how they were treated. She was just the sweetest, tiny little thing and was always friendly and happy and I know she had to remember those undignified injustices her people suffered.
Well, I know I'm supposed to be reviewing the movie, but if you've ever read my reviews, you must know I can't ever close my mouth without railing about something.
I thought the movie was very enlightening, to me at least.  I learned so much from watching it.  I don't ever remember reading about anything like that when I was coming up the chains of schools back in those days.  They must have been still keeping it quiet.  We sure read a lot about old Shakespeare and the French Revolution and other stuff I didn't care one whit about.  I would've been interested in what my people and the other early settlers went through to make this country what it is.  I had no idea that Jewish people and Irish people and others had settled right up there where I lived in those Appalachians.  I took it for granted all of these long years that they all came from Boston and New York. And settled there.  Most of them never left it.  If I had ever thought about it I would have had to wonder how on earth did I get to be having all of these races within me.  Irish, German, English, Scottish, you name it there was some of it in my family.  So you can see that we didn't really have any ""real"" born USA'ns or Native Americans.  The Indians were the Native Americans.
Back to the movie.  Billy Ray did a bang up job of hosting it.  He seemed so well informed.  I'm sure he was too, seeing as how he's one of us Appalatians.  He held my interest, because he just talked like it was something he had just gone through. Good for him.  I remember how he was so jeered over his song, achey brachy heart.  (I cannot remember how to spell it.) I expected any minute for him to start singing and dancing the ""achey brakey heart"".  Which by the way, I'm learning how to do in my dancercize class as I speak.  Can you imagine 71 years old and out on the town doing the achey brachey dance?  I can barely walk in a straight line due to old age infirmaries, but I can do those line dances.  I haven't fallen down yet.  Thanks to Miley, it's back in fashion, at least in the saloons where we do line dancing.  I love it.
I am purchasing this movie right now so that I can watch it some more uninterrupted.  I happened upon it while looking for something to watch one night when I couldn't go to sleep.  I had missed probably almost an hour of it.  So now I can buy it, and by the way, I came upon it by accident here.  Maybe I can get some of my kids and grandkids to watch what their ancestors tolerated many years ago, yet not all that long ago that it should ever be forgotten.  (One more thing, my 2 year old granddaughter who is now 28 would come to my house about every day wearing her danskins and she would primp all up and climb on the coffee table and say to me ""Mamaw, achey achey heart, Mamaw, achey, achey, heart"".  And so I would have to keep rewinding that cassette tape so she could do her version.' I finally made her a tape of her own, and it was just ""achy breaky heart"" about a dozen times, so that I didn't have to keep running to rewind it for her.  I wonder if she remembers that.  We're going out to dinner tomorrow evening, and I will now have something new to talk about with them.",1219968000,5,7313,4.267441860465116

While I didn't do the research to find out how true some of the information is in the DVD; it did give me new avenues to explore in my quest to track down our family history. My family is from Appalachia and my understanding of the area and the culture is minimal. We were not raised with our Tennessee family so trying to track our roots and culture is difficult. The DVD provided some real insight into what a ""Hillbilly"" really is and I am not going to give away the meaning of ""Red Neck"". You'll just have to see for yourself.

After a thorough cleaning, the same problems resulted;  no sound or anything through most of the segments.  We found out it was not the player, as we viewed 2 nights of other CD/TV series after this attempt to view Hillbilly-The Real Story.

I moved to NC enrolled in app studies at Appalachian State University and I fall more and more in love with the topic matter with each passing day. This movie is a MUST for history buffs. It has broad range and is entertaining while delivering mounds of information. It is so interesting I am always sad to see it end...

3099563,4,B0012Y10HK,"The description in my onscreen program guide said, ""A look at 200 years of mythic hillbillies"". That's a pretty bold pronouncement, but this documentary delivers. While I was born in West Virginia (and have a huge section of family that still lives there and always will), I never really lived there. HILLBILLY really makes me wish I'd paid more attention during all of those childhood visits: moonshining folk heroes who survive a dozen gunshot wounds and then get pardoned by the President. The dreadful cost of building real roads and railroads where they didn't exist before. Big corporations hiring a private army complete with airplanes to try and bust budding unions, and more.

3099566,4,B0012Y10HK,"I've lived among the mountain folk of East Tennessee for almost ten years, and while here I've read many histories and watched films and documentaries made on the area. The one I recommend most is The History Channel's Hillbilly: The Real Story, produced by Moore Huntley Productions and hosted by Billy Ray Cyrus. It gives a complete picture of mountain people, where they came from, how their culture developed, why they believe and live as they do and who they have become over the centuries.

Billy Ray journeys into the hollers and runs of Appalachia to discover the proud legacy of the region's mountain folk. Watch it and you will learn how hillbillies, long misunderstood as isolated and backward, actually have a 300-year history of achievement that has contributed significantly to our national identity.",1280361600,17,814,5.074626865671642

Tell the truth in history call. It is presented in a very interesting way.",1278028800,2,407,4.368421052631579
3099568,4,B0012Y10HK,"As a person from Eastern Kentucky, I found this recent History Channel docummentary quite interesting.  First of all, I should point out that much of its material is some of the more sensational aspects of Appalachia.  Moonshining (with its connection to NASCAR), marijuna, and feuds get some time.  Much of the section on religion is devoted to explaining snake handeling churches, which as the documentary notes are a small minority in the region.

  That said, I must say that the documentary is informative and interesting.  The reenactments are generally well executed.  Scotch Irish settler history, the Battle of King Mountain in the Revolution, the building of the Clinchfield Railroad, and the TVA are all discussed.  The time devoted to the coal conflicts in 1920s West Virginia was especially interesting.  Even the senstaional material was informative and entertaining.  Overall, Billy Ray Cyrus did a decent job as a host as well.  Despite a heavy focus on sensationalism, the documentary was surprisingly sympathetic towards Appalachian people.  Even the existence of snake churches is viewed more in the light of religious tolerance in West Virginia than how it could have been portrayed.

On the whole, I recommend the documentary for anyone wanting a brief overview of Appalachia.  Just be aware that some of the sensational aspects are perhaps overplayed (though moonshining was in fact very common years ago).",1272153600,36,1428,5.2844444444444445

They grew and raised all of their food.  There was no driving or even walking to the grocery store.  If they didn't raise it, they didn't eat. They learned how to preserve and use every bit of food stuffs they could.  My grandmothers all could make the best saurkraut I've ever eaten.  It's totally different from any you'll ever find in a store.  They canned green beans, tomatoes, corn, and everything else they could raise.  They even figured out pickling vegetables and I'm still addicted to it.  I learned how to do it from my grandmothers and my mother-in-law, but it's such a long, dramatic thing that it's hard to get excited about it any more when we have so much other stuff in the stores.  BUT, I still make it up to the mountains, around the reservation and can still buy the saurkraut and pickled beans and corn, okra, etc from someone who has kept it going.
Most of them didn't have radios and naturally no one had any TVs, and so the war effort meant little or squat to them. All they knew was their government took their homes.  And now, my other side of the family, some being full blooded Cherokee Indians, I can't even talk about it.  They were treated worse than people treat their dogs today.  Although, none of my ancestors as far as I know, were made to go down that Trail of Tears, I still feel heartbreak for them.  Thank God, some of these wrongs are being made right today for them now.  I do remember this scene:  The Indians were allowed to come into the little town where we lived, Robbinsville, on Saturdays (and not Sunday through Friday) to buy (or barter) for the supplies that they could get and I would sit on this rock wall (that kept our house from sliding down the mountain), with them waiting for their busses to come after them to take them back to the reservation.  We got along really well.  I must've spoken some kind of ""childspeak"" to them, because I certainly didn't know their language, but maybe they knew some of mine.  I remember many times by the time their bus got there, they would have given me nickels.  I thought I was queen of something.  I just loved them.  At the time I didn't know I was partly one of them.  I'm proud of that heritage.  That was their land in the very beginning, and look what we did to them.  My little great grandmother who was full blooded Cherokee never mentioned how they were treated. She was just the sweetest, tiny little thing and was always friendly and happy and I know she had to remember those undignified injustices her people suffered.
Well, I know I'm supposed to be reviewing the movie, but if you've ever read my reviews, you must know I can't ever close my mouth without railing about something.
I thought the movie was very enlightening, to me at least.  I learned so much from watching it.  I don't ever remember reading about anything like that when I was coming up the chains of schools back in those days.  They must have been still keeping it quiet.  We sure read a lot about old Shakespeare and the French Revolution and other stuff I didn't care one whit about.  I would've been interested in what my people and the other early settlers went through to make this country what it is.  I had no idea that Jewish people and Irish people and others had settled right up there where I lived in those Appalachians.  I took it for granted all of these long years that they all came from Boston and New York. And settled there.  Most of them never left it.  If I had ever thought about it I would have had to wonder how on earth did I get to be having all of these races within me.  Irish, German, English, Scottish, you name it there was some of it in my family.  So you can see that we didn't really have any ""real"" born USA'ns or Native Americans.  The Indians were the Native Americans.
Back to the movie.  Billy Ray did a bang up job of hosting it.  He seemed so well informed.  I'm sure he was too, seeing as how he's one of us Appalatians.  He held my interest, because he just talked like it was something he had just gone through. Good for him.  I remember how he was so jeered over his song, achey brachy heart.  (I cannot remember how to spell it.) I expected any minute for him to start singing and dancing the ""achey brakey heart"".  Which by the way, I'm learning how to do in my dancercize class as I speak.  Can you imagine 71 years old and out on the town doing the achey brachey dance?  I can barely walk in a straight line due to old age infirmaries, but I can do those line dances.  I haven't fallen down yet.  Thanks to Miley, it's back in fashion, at least in the saloons where we do line dancing.  I love it.
I am purchasing this movie right now so that I can watch it some more uninterrupted.  I happened upon it while looking for something to watch one night when I couldn't go to sleep.  I had missed probably almost an hour of it.  So now I can buy it, and by the way, I came upon it by accident here.  Maybe I can get some of my kids and grandkids to watch what their ancestors tolerated many years ago, yet not all that long ago that it should ever be forgotten.  (One more thing, my 2 year old granddaughter who is now 28 would come to my house about every day wearing her danskins and she would primp all up and climb on the coffee table and say to me ""Mamaw, achey achey heart, Mamaw, achey, achey, heart"".  And so I would have to keep rewinding that cassette tape so she could do her version.' I finally made her a tape of her own, and it was just ""achy breaky heart"" about a dozen times, so that I didn't have to keep running to rewind it for her.  I wonder if she remembers that.  We're going out to dinner tomorrow evening, and I will now have something new to talk about with them.",1219968000,5,7313,4.267441860465116

We found out it was not the player, as we viewed 2 nights of other CD/TV series after this attempt to view Hillbilly-The Real Story.

While I was born in West Virginia (and have a huge section of family that still lives there and always will), I never really lived there. HILLBILLY really makes me wish I'd paid more attention during all of those childhood visits: moonshining folk heroes who survive a dozen gunshot wounds and then get pardoned by the President. The dreadful cost of building real roads and railroads where they didn't exist before. Big corporations hiring a private army complete with airplanes to try and bust budding unions, and more.

3334063,4,B0012Y10HK,"I've lived among the mountain folk of East Tennessee for almost ten years, and while here I've read many histories and watched films and documentaries made on the area. The one I recommend most is The History Channel's Hillbilly: The Real Story, produced by Moore Huntley Productions and hosted by Billy Ray Cyrus. It gives a complete picture of mountain people, where they came from, how their culture developed, why they believe and live as they do and who they have become over the centuries.

Billy Ray journeys into the hollers and runs of Appalachia to discover the proud legacy of the region's mountain folk. Watch it and you will learn how hillbillies, long misunderstood as isolated and backward, actually have a 300-year history of achievement that has contributed significantly to our national identity.",1280361600,17,814,5.074626865671642

3334065,4,B0012Y10HK,"As a person from Eastern Kentucky, I found this recent History Channel docummentary quite interesting.  First of all, I should point out that much of its material is some of the more sensational aspects of Appalachia.  Moonshining (with its connection to NASCAR), marijuna, and feuds get some time.  Much of the section on religion is devoted to explaining snake handeling churches, which as the documentary notes are a small minority in the region.

  That said, I must say that the documentary is informative and interesting.  The reenactments are generally well executed.  Scotch Irish settler history, the Battle of King Mountain in the Revolution, the building of the Clinchfield Railroad, and the TVA are all discussed.  The time devoted to the coal conflicts in 1920s West Virginia was especially interesting.  Even the senstaional material was informative and entertaining.  Overall, Billy Ray Cyrus did a decent job as a host as well.  Despite a heavy focus on sensationalism, the documentary was surprisingly sympathetic towards Appalachian people.  Even the existence of snake churches is viewed more in the light of religious tolerance in West Virginia than how it could have been portrayed.

On the whole, I recommend the documentary for anyone wanting a brief overview of Appalachia.  Just be aware that some of the sensational aspects are perhaps overplayed (though moonshining was in fact very common years ago).",1272153600,36,1428,5.2844444444444445
