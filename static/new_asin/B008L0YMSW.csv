5169074,5,B008L0YMSW,"If you're a kaiju fan you'll love this! I had never seen a Daimajin film before buying this set and I must say that I am blown away!

If you're a lover of japanese period dramas like Seven Samurai, Sword of Doom, and Hidden Fortress, I think you'll appreciate these films as well.

First off, they're no Akira Kurosawa masterpieces but you also have to realize that not everything Kurosawa made was gold. The films in this set are very much similar stories to Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress. Set in feudal Japan, rural principalities come under foreign aggression, the people are enslaved and callously murdered by the invading lords. The oppressed populace pray to their mountain god, the Majin, for help.

Here's where the films interject japanese mythology and mysticism. The Majin comes down from the mountain. The skies turn red. Nature erupts! The Wrath of God is shown with some fairly convincing special effects. The Majin wreaks righteous justice in some gory and horrific ways!

The first film is definitely the best. The second is really good too. The third falls short some but is still very enjoyable.

The picture quality is amazing! These films were made in 1965, the transfer looks as if they could have been made 10 years ago! The sound is good (I don't have a surround sound so I'll leave the audio review at good). Each film has a making of feature and theatrical trailer.

Final Word: This set is totally worth it, whether you're a kaiju fan or feudal era fan! This set is great!",1352592000,10,1502,4.692015209125476
5169075,5,B008L0YMSW,"Like Wagner's ""Complete Ring Cycle,"" one truly needs to view ""The Complete Daimajin"" to gain a full appreciation of the work. Here, the epic saga is together in a fabulous Blu Ray set, and finally restored to its original aspect ratio.

""Daimajin"" (which means ""Great Majin,"" if that is any help. You could translate ""Majin"" as ""monster"" if you like, but that is a bit of a stretch.) is a classic genre mash-up. Japan makes awesome monster flicks. Japan also makes awesome samurai flicks. Somewhere along the lines someone at Daiei studios realized that a samurai/monster flick would essentially double the awesome. And they were right.

In what is now a more common practice, all three ""Daimajin"" movies--""Daimajin,"" ""Return of Daimajin"" (""Daimajin Ikaru"" or ""Daimajin Gets Mad""), and ""Wrath of Daimajin"" (""Daimajin Gyakushu"" or ""Daimajin's Counterattack"")--were made at the same time with different directors but released a few months apart. The three stories are not related, other than featuring the mighty Daimajin itself. Always on the side of right, always waiting till the last minute to awaken and seek revenge, Daimajin brings giant stony justice on those who would wrong the innocent.

The series is heavily influenced by Japan's native Shinto religion. Almost every village worth its soy sauce has a nearby mountain occupied by a mighty protector spirit. Not all of them have massive stone statues standing guard--very few do, actually, as Japanese kami almost never have physical form. But I have seen a few with centuries old statues of warrior gods. All of these have local legends about how, in times of strife, these gods will rise up and protect their chose village. Staring at those ancient statues, you can't help but think how cool it would be if the legends were true. Obviously, someone at Daiei was thinking the same thing.

The Great Grey God himself wears armor from the Kofun period of Japan, which is instantly recognizable by Japanese audiences and shows the great age of the statue. Like most kami, ""Daimajin"" is neither good nor evil.  He just is.  Awakening him, asking his favor, can lead to your own destruction.  It is equivalent to begging help from an earthquake or typhoon to smite your enemies, even when you happen to be standing right next to them.  A weapon of last resort.

The three films are:

""Daimajin"" (1966) D. Yasuda Kimiyoshi - The first film in the trilogy sets the tone and theme.  The chamberlain Samanosuke uses the legend of the Daimajin as an excuse to murder his boss, the kind and just Lord Hanabasa, and set himself up as tyrant.  Hanabasa's children escape, and are raised by a priestess in the shadow of the ancient stone statue.  The kids get big and want revenge, but they lack the power they need.  Perhaps an ancient spirit of vengeance can help?  Be careful what you unleash.

""Return of Daimajin"" (1966) D. Misumi Kenji-The Daimajin is now in an island in a lake between too peaceful villages, Chigusa and Nagoshi. A near-by evil overlord looks down on this idyllic scene and decides that it can't last.  And he thinks the yearly festival of the Daimajin is the perfect time to swarm in with his armies and conquer.  He also wants to show all of the ignorant villagers how worthless their protector spirit is by blowing up the statue with gunpowder. Bad idea.

""Wrath of Daimajin"" (1966) D. Mori Kazuo- The third and final film, and my favorite of the series. Daimajin is back up on a mountain again, in evil overlord territory.  The bad guy has captured some village men for his forced labor camps, and it is up to their sons to free them.  But, the sons have to cross Majin Mountain, the forbidden realm of the dark Majin god. They are good boys, and show proper respect to the stone statue (something appreciated by every dark Majin god).  In comes the overlords men, who mock the superstitions of the peasants and once again try to prove their superiority by demolishing the ancient statue.  When will they ever learn?  Sword fights in the snow add an extra bit of samurai goodness to this one.

The ""Daimajin"" series is a gem of the kaiju giant monster genre. Aside from the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/B005VU9LKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>, kaiju flicks aren't known for their deep storylines. They are the professional wrestling of the movie world--everyone knows they are cheesy and fake, but everyone is in on the joke so they all have a good time. ""Daimajin"" takes things into more somber territory, combining the depth and story of the samurai genre along with a giant man in a rubber suit destroying things. The special effects are impressive, amongst the best of the `60s kaiju films. There are some great monster scenes, and Daimajin's transformation is always fun to watch.

Actually, everything about this series is quite good. Fans of Japanese Samurai films or monster films cannot go wrong with ""Daimajin.""

This Mill Creek Entertainment Blu Ray is an excellent release of these films, with all three films on two disks.  There are some pretty cool bonus features--a Behind the Scenes featurette and an interview with cinematographer Morita Fujio.  There are some new English dubs, if you are into that sort of thing.  The picture looks fantastic, and--after years of being chopped up--the Complete Daimajin is back in its original aspect ratio.  This is one to get.",1349308800,31,5430,4.9734513274336285
5169076,5,B008L0YMSW,"All I can say is WOW!!!!

5169077,5,B008L0YMSW,"If you are a fan of classic Japanese films or Kaiju films, then this set is a MUST-BUY!!! The films look great in all their widescreen glory in 1080p. The haunting musical score for the films was done by legendary ""Godzilla"" composer Akira Ifukube. The films have stood the test of time very well. The special effects are still astonishing even after over 40 years. These films are loaded with Japanese culture, folklore, traditions, music & dance, and history. The blu-ray transfers are incredible and you can see so much detail in these films. There is no noticeable annoying excessive tampering like too much DNR and/or aliasing. THANK YOU MILL CREEK!!! This set is a blu-ray essential purchase.",1348358400,32,698,4.923728813559322
5169078,5,B008L0YMSW,"To be honest, I only got these movies because they were made by the same studio that made Gamera. But as I watched them, I realized these were not your every day cheesy special effect monster movies. They seem to have relatively good stories, each movie can stand on it's own, and the print quality seems pretty good. Also the Daimajin is only in like the last 15 minutes of the movies. Which I think helps by not filling the movies with alot of cheap effects, just a few good effects. Quality not quantity! So if you like Gamera or Godzilla, you should like these, but if you like lots of monsters during the whole movie, you might not. Godzilla fans might also like the music. Not to mention you get 3 movies on blu-ray for about the price of 1.",1348358400,86,747,4.304964539007092
5169079,5,B008L0YMSW,"I'm not going to bother reviewing the films. If your reading this then you are either already familiar with this fantastic franchise, or you are just discovering it, in which case nothing I can say will do it justice in terms of relating it's sheer awesomeness. That said: Having owned the Daimajin trilogy in all it's various incarnations, this long overdue effort is without a doubt the best ever presentation of the these films for the home entertainment market. While not perfect, they are nevertheless literally world's away from the ADV / Rubbersuit DVD collection (which was the previous best). It's like comparing a donkey cart to a jet plane. The upgrade brings life to these films in such a way as you will feel you are seeing them for the first time, with a clarity and depth wholly lacking in all past releases. Presented in the original Japanese, with optional English audio tracks or subtitles, and nicely packaged; it's only downside is the sparsity of extras. Overall: Kudos to Mill Creek Entertainment!

5169086,3,B008L0YMSW,"Essentially, this ""trilogy"" is just the same movie made three different times with slight differences.  They all have the same formula:  an evil dictator takes over the land.  The rebels try to fight back but fail.  And then Daimajin shows up at the last 15 minutes and saves the day by destroying everything.  The evil dictator in each movie even looks the same in each one.  What does make these movies great are the parts with Daimajin in them.  He is basically a giant stature that comes to life and destroys everything in his path.  The suit they use for Daimajin in the movie actually looks rather intimidating as opposed to cheesy like the Godzilla films.  Even though he only shows up in the last 15 minutes of each one, seeing him destroy a corrupt empire and kill the bad guy is great to watch.  The effects are done really well with great miniature and animatronic work.  It's dated by today's standards but the amount of detail put in to these sequences is still breathtaking to behold.  It's just very well directed and looks amazing on blu ray.  If you like old school Giant monster action, then this might be worth getting if for no other reason than to see the last 15 minutes of each of these films for when Daimajin shows up.  My only complaint is like I said,  Daimajin didn't show up until the very end of each movie.",1470355200,,1337,4.466942148760331

5169103,5,B008L0YMSW,"Like many, I first saw these films (the first two anyway) in their AIP, direct-to-TV, dubbed versions as a young kid on my local, Saturday afternoon Creature Double Feature.  Being a Godzilla fanatic first and foremost, I always liked but never loved them.  For me they fell squarely into the ""next best thing"" category if they weren't showing Godzilla.  All I can say now, seeing these Blu-Ray, HD transfers---however they produced them, I'm no video expert---is: WOW!  They are simply stunning visually---it's hard to believe these films were made in 1966, and harder to believe they could be restored/reproduced to this level of quality for home viewing.

Even if you're familiar with them you'll feel like you're watching them for the first time.  You can really appreciate the artistry and skill put into these films seeing them in this form, and I enjoy watching them a lot more now that I'm not a kid ""settling"" for them in lieu of a Godzilla film on my weekly creature feature.  As l said, all three look amazing.  I did notice a couple of almost imperceptible spots where the video quality dips ever so slightly from pristine---very slight darkening/dulling of the image in a few brief spots, in some darkly lit scenes you can see some very faint gridlines behind the image---but I think I only even picked up on these couple spots because the overall quality is so eye-popping.

As for the films themselves, I would personally rank them in the order originally produced and presented in this collection. The first film is definitely the best overall, with the second film being a close runner up.  There's also a greater similarity in both content and production style in the first two films.  The third film has a notably different look and feel IMO.  Still looks amazing, but the plot is thinner to the point of being almost non-existent; feels like just a bare bones set-up for the inevitable final act.  And, as another reviewer noted, for a sizable chunk of the film it feels like the camera is just following around a group of kids on a hike through some gorgeous scenery.  I can see why AIP would have passed on this one back in the day.  For its part though, the third film might have the best, most epic and colorful rampage of them all, with the Majin using his sword for the first time, and the whole finale taking place in a blizzard.  Dark, ominous reds are used to great effect in all three films, but are especially striking in this one when set against the snow.  Another cool thing about these films collectively is how each director chose a unique locale as the resting place of the statue (mountainside/forest, island/lake, mountaintop/higher altitude).

Can't be overstated too what a coup it was that Daei MPC was able to ""borrow"" Akira Ifukube from Toho Studios to score these films. His music adds every bit to these movies that it does to the best Godzilla films; they would really be missing something indispensable without it.  His score for the first film sounds more like a collection of adapted Godzilla pieces, where for the second and third he develops some truly spooky themes tailored more specifically to these films.

Bottom line: this collection would be well worth it at the $24.99 list price.  At the current Prime sale price of $9.99, it's an absolute steal.",1443744000,,3307,4.746503496503497

5169119,5,B008L0YMSW,"One of the greatest film series to come out of the golden age of Kaiju Eiga from Japan gets a first-class treatment on stunning Blu-ray in this impressive, award-winning release from Mill Creek!

Daiei Studios made its mark in film history with the fun, surreal, always silly and, sadly, often unfairly maligned ""Gamera"" series. But early on during that same period they also released these three visually impressive films. Superior in most every respect to the Gamera films. The smaller scale (5 meters) of the title monster and more simplistic building designs in the village sets allowed Daiei's SPFX technicians to construct miniatures with far more detail than normal, helping suspension of disbelief immensely. These films feature some truly impressive camera work, (much of it shot in-camera) and gorgeous location photography. In fact the first film won the Japanese equivalent of an Academy Award for cinematography, no less! All three films are essentially telling the same story, only from different directors and somewhat different perspectives. They are simplistic samurai melodramas for the first 2/3, before switching over to full-on fantasy & horror in the final act. It was an interesting and, in my opinion, highly successful experiment from Daiei.

The design of Majin is simple and all the more effective for it. His motivations are straightforward & uncomplicated and his intervention can be as much of a curse as a blessing. As a child, I found the first film (easily the best of the bunch) to be sort of a Far East take on The Ten Commandments. The second film lays bare that analogy with one of the coolest homages to that classic bible story, with Majin making the baddest Moses ever as he parts the waters of the lake and comes ashore from his island shrine to wreck his terrible vengeance upon the bad guys. The scale & scope of destruction in all three films are impressive, with tons of katana-wielding swordplay, much smashing of buildings and ruthless crushing of villains. (The scene in the first film where one of the bad guys is literally ground into one of the stone walls of the villain's fortress by Majin is one that will stay with you for some time!) My first real exposure to film horror as a young boy came during the closing moments of that first film, when head villain Samanosuke is crucified on a makeshift cross by Majin. Not only that terrible (yet somehow just) act in and of itself gave me a fright, but the look of utter contempt (and indifference to such violence) on Majin's stoic face gave me shivers. Agh! those eyes! How powerful was the unflinching stare of Those Eyes!!!

The music is an equally important factor in the popularity of these films. Godzilla composer extraordinaire Akira Ifukube took time out of an incredibly busy schedule at Toho Studios to compose some of the most thunderingly impressive and memorable film music in all of Japanese giant monsterdom. Majin's echoing footsteps are kept company by Ifukbe's bass-rumbling score. Powerful in all the right spots yet soft, and even tender as well, when needed. All hallmarks of a master composer who left an indelible stamp in the ears & minds of millions of viewers over the course of his 60+ year career.

Prior to this, Mill Creek was more well-known for it's crappy multi-movie collections, using awful-looking PD sourced prints. They really stepped up and delivered a top-shelf release worthy of any of the major film studios with this trilogy. The quality of the Blu-ray picture cannot be understated. If you've seen these films before now it was probably on an old UHF station, early in the morning or late at night. The picture was grainy and washed out using a pitiful pan&scan print that was a true eyesore, and the audio portion of these old prints featured warbly soundtracks with jumpcuts, hissing, pops & crackles, etc.  With these Blu-rays the films look every bit as good - or better - than they did when first released way back in 1966! I was incredibly impressed at the amazing level of detail that popped right off the screen. It's staggering. You can now make out the intricately woven patterns in the clothing; even count individual fabric threads! The gorgeous color palettes (especially in the third film) can finally be appreciated. The soundmix is now as it should be. And I want to give a special call-out to Mill Creek for not only including the beloved old AIP English language dubs for the first two films, (nicely cleaned up!), but for going the extra mile and creating an all-new English dub track for the third film, which was never released over here in the U.S.!

I was very happy to find out Mill Creek Entertainment picked up the copyright and planned a Blu-Ray release. I ordered it and after watching all of it, I am happy to report that Mill Creek did an outstanding job with the Daimajin Triple Feature on Blu-Ray, releasing a product of great quality at a very affordable price. This is easily one of the best releases put out by Mill Creek.

This is a two disc set with each disc a single side BD-50. The first disc has Daimajin and Return Of Daimajin. The second disc has Daimajin Strikes Again and Bonus Features. I found the picture/sound quality to be crisp/clear across the board with all three films as well as the special features. The films are available in Japanese and English, with a new English dub for Daimajin Strikes Again. Special features include the trailers for each film as well as each film having a half hour featurette with Daimajin cameraman Fujio Morita that covers the making of the films and more.

The first film drew me in so much that I ended up watching all three films back to back, making for a wonderful afternoon. It was my first time watching these films and I was very impressed by the plots, the action, the special effects and the powerful soundtrack provided by Akira Ifukube.  All of the films have amazing and intense imagery. There is much buildup in each film leading to where Daimajin comes to life but when it does, it's worth all the buildup.

My only slight gripe is that it would have been nice if Mill Creek released this also remastered on DVD or a DVD/Blu-Ray Combo pack. I highly recommend the Daimajin Triple Feature and I'll be watching it for years to come.",1417478400,,1777,4.492260061919505

I always remembered the end of the movie and how it was cemented in my brain. When I saw this set on Amazon I wondered if it was the same movie because I remembered it as a B&W movie my brother and I saw numerous times on TV in Baltimore. Then I realized we had a B&W TV back then. So I ordered the set not expecting much even though it was on Blu-ray. I have ordered many movies on Blu-ray that were more or less straight DVD transfers that were not any better then DVD. Plus these Daimajin movies were from the 60's so I expected them to have drop outs, blemishes etc. Well guess what, all 3 movies look like they were made yesterday. Great HD picture, great sound etc etc etc. I could not believe how well the movies looked on a large TV screen. So as I was being dazzled by the first movie I thought well this can't be the same movie I saw as a kid, until a scene towards the end of the movie. I actually felt goosebumps because I knew what was coming up next for the main bad guy in the movie. Same movie I loved as a kid but in color.

5169146,4,B008L0YMSW,"While very familiar with the numerous Toho monster/sci-fi movies, I was only vaguely aware of the Daimajin series. I had never seen a complete film and only excerpts from RETURN OF DAIMAJIN. When I saw that amazon had this blu-ray available at a greatly reduced price, I couldn't resist and now I'm glad I didn't. I'm also glad that when I finally got to see these movies, I got to see them in this form. I've recently taken advantage of the availablity of the original Japanese versions of the classic films like GODZILLA, RODAN & MOTHRA and have enjoyed them immensely. Not only do you not suffer through the horrible English dubbing but you get to see the movies with their original continuity and at the slower pace typical of the Japanese cinema at the time..

Since the DAIMAJIN series is a mixture of history and fantasy, It's like watching Miyazaki's animated films come to life. The period detail is rich, the photography memorable and the color scheme is suitably vivid. The stories are all simple and very similar with a powerful and evil warlord oppressing the peasants in one form or another only to have a giant stone statue come to life and set things to right. I found it interesting that, in the English subttitles, the Majin is referred to as God (capital G) rather than by his name or as a spirit. I would have thought this the whim of the translators except that one of the films THE RETURN OF DAIMAJIN is full of Christian imagery from crosses to crucifictions. Very curious.

All the movies were shot back to back in 1966 before the Daiei Film Company went international with the Gamera giant flying turtle series. Whether these weren't that popular or there was nothing left to say (which didn't hold Gamera or Godzilla back), there were only these three films. They seems like an ideal combination of the samurai film and the giant monster movie and I thought there would have been more. No matter. All three films have great production values with fantastic miniature sets, beautiful vistas, great music from GODZILLA's Akira Ifukube and, of course, lots and lots of destruction. Plus there's the added satisfaction of seeing the principal villians REALLY get their just desserts.

The first film DAIMAJIN introduces us to the character and is the one that most closely resembles a samurai film with its storyline of usurpation of power, murdered family members, revenge, sacrifice and ultimate triumph. The second film, RETURN OF DAIMAJIN is more detailed with further character development and, as mentioned earlier, lots of Christian symbolism. The death of the villain is particularly satisfying. The third film DAIMAJIN STRIKES AGAIN was apparently not released in the U.S. It's principal characters are children and it takes on more of an INCREDIBLE JOURNEY aspect (minus the animals although there's a hawk). All three end with the statue coming to life and doing its thing which is always impressive.

I remember seeing these movies when I was a kid on the Creature Double Feature. I sort of liked them as a kid. Seeing them again, I love them!

5169157,4,B008L0YMSW,"If you enjoy the Majin films you will love this Blu-ray set. These films have never looked so good and this set blows away the earlier DVD releases by ADV Films and RetroMedia (although if you want to see the films the way they looked when broadcast on UHF stations in the 70s, pick up the RetroMedia release). These look so amazing that frankly it's a bit weird to watch them with their original A.I.P dubbing  the image is just too clean for bad lip-synching  watch it in Japanese with subtitles. Still, it's nice to have a choice. I won't get into the film synopses; they've been covered elsewhere many times. The first 2 films (Majin and Return of Majin) are my favorites. The third film doesn't work for me. I found it slow and boring and the three children that are the focus of the story don't hold my attention. In this case, the super high-quality Blu-ray transfer actually hurts since the image is so crystal clear that the studio sets are all too evident. This film is set during winter and nearly all the scenes are shot in studio, as opposed to the many locations shots in the first two movies. The result is, you feel as though you're watching a weird play on a large soundstage. I will say though, that a brand new English dub was created for the third film (it was never released in the States) and it's pretty good so kudos to Mill Creek for that.

5169161,5,B008L0YMSW,"The Daimajin collection brings you a trilogy of the not well-known Daimajin kaiju. Leagues away from what you can expect from a Godzilla or Gamera film, these are much more dramatic films. The best way to imagine the feel of these movies is to picture if a samurai film decided that instead of the hero hacking his way to justice in the climax, a giant stone god would come to life to avenge the underdog. And it's no surprise that these have such a samurai film feel -- if you are familiar with the Zatoichi series, the directors of each film (Kenji Misumi, Kazuo Mori, and Kimiyoshi Yasuda) all directed multiple Zatoichi films.

The films take place in feudal Japan and all three involve a corrupt warlord subjugating hapless villagers. The first film centers around the children of a betrayed lord who grow up in exile and return for vengeance and justice. The second features a greedy warlord scheming to overtake lands that are not his. The final film follows four children on a trek across the god's mountain trying to save a group of village men forced into slavery for another evil warlord.

The plots are fairly simple, and the climaxes foregone conclusion, but the drama is done well. The first film has the most of that samurai movie feel. The second was the weakest of the three for me, but still it was not a bad movie by any means. The final one was the most charming, and least predictable of the three and I enjoyed it the most.

All three have truly amazing cinematography. Not only are the films set against majestic landscapes, but each director had an unerring sense for what effects of the giant monster would or would not look good, and anything unsatisfactory must have hit the cutting room floor. All the effects have aged very well due to this, and are the most convincing kaiju effects I have seen from any movie out of this era, and even from most of them made in the decades to follow. By keeping the effects from being too ""big"" each director has kept the films from falling into absurdity once the 50 foot tall monster emerges.

More high marks go to the scores, and with Akira Ifukube of Godzilla fame at the helm that is no surprise at all. All of the music enforces the magical feel of the movies and enhances the drama and destruction throughout.

Kaiju fans will be very pleased with these more dramatic takes on the genre, and even non-kaiju fans can enjoy the films since they rely so much more on the characters than the creature itself.

As for the Blu-Ray itself, these are some jaw dropping transers. I have other Japanese kaiju films from more recent times, and better selling franchises, on Blu-Ray and they don't look half as good as the Daimajin films do. Someone put a lot of love into these. The Japanese audio has not been modernized to a 5.1 surround mix, but the authentic 2 channel mix works just fine and that monster's footsteps still boom out. The English audio track is just slightly inferior to the Japanese track in terms of actual sound, however, I can't imagine anyone will listen to it due to the poor dubs that these movies have been given. The first two films are not the WORST I have ever heard, but the advertised new English language track for Daimajin Strikes Again is excruciating and will have even hardcore ""dubs over subs"" folks giving it up to do the Japanese audio with subtitles.

Each film is accompanied by a 30 minute segment of a 90 minute total documentary/interview with cinematographer Fujio Morita. It features some good spots on how the effects were done, but for the most part only those very interested in either Daimajin or filmmaking from this time will want to sit through all of it as it seems to be largely unedited from the raw interview and is rather dry as a result. Still, I am impressed that such an out of the way type release as this got such a full documentary attached to it.

Overall, great accessible kaiju films done by top notch directors with everything spot on from effects to music AND you have an AWESOME transfer of the films. It's an incredible set. I had only vaguely heard of Daimajin but decided to pick it up since all three were in one set and I am so glad I did.",1380412800,2,4177,4.515873015873016

5169165,5,B008L0YMSW,"So I was unprepared for the different tempo and serious plotlines of this Daimajin trio. Whereas Ichi has fewer characters but more explored Daimajin has scores (hundreds, maybe) of characters, but all are pretty much alike. The bad guys are really Bad; sweet, simple  peasants are all well-dramatized  and scruffy.

In Daimajin it's simply simple generic villagers being used/abused and God, in the form of Daimajin is their savior. I guess the D God is a subtle mix of Shinto and Christian religions. Crosses and Christian icons are seen throughout - with pious prayers, dogma and crucifixions too.

D's role, to protect innocent villagers from, as in Zatoichi, mean exploitative greedy capitalists enslaving innocent
peasants. That's no spoiler, just what the Z and D stories are all about, with Daimajin as Savior and bad guys punisher.

This 'Triple Feature Collection', in BluRay, for $9.99 is graphically rich, exciting lessons in mortalities, complete with exotic, rugged scenery with basic effects - No CGI/computer graphics - but locations are dramatic as you'll ever see. The chracters feel really real. The total effect, very elegant simplity in visuals and acting dramatically and violently telling each of the three separate but somewhat similar stories. Good dubbing or clear subtitles, great use of wilderness locations all add up to engrossing entertainment.

I hope other Daimajin stories will be available. I still favor the humor and great characterizations of Ichi the gambling, massacre prone-loveable-funny-wise masseur. Actually, it's great Daimajin is as different from Zatoichi as it is. Who wants the same-old-same-old again and again.

Last note: The rugged realism of Daimajin's people and Japanese peasantry with scenery to match, with mean-as-can-be-bad villians makes this trio of Daimajin stories worth seeing again and again.

Well i remembered this movie and could never find due to i could not remember the name, then i found it on amazon and it was all three movies. So i sat down and was ready to be disappointed and nope the movies were great. The Transfer was incredible and for the time they were made the effects were great.

5169181,5,B008L0YMSW,"I was excited to order this set when it went on special for $10 & even signed up for the Amazon card with a $10 bonus credit as suggested by the checkout. Everything seemed to go fine but for some reason, the order never processed.  The price has now doubled and I can find no one who can tell my why. $20 for the trilogy on blu-ray isn't exorbitant but I am extremely displeased by what appears to be Amazon luring me to sign up for their card and then not delivering on the product they used to get me to sign up for it in the first place!  I know the reviews section isn't really the place for this and from what I hear about this set, it sounds great and I'd love to see it but they haven't given me anywhere else to get any answers so I'm having to resort to this. Hopefully, it's just a minor error and all can be fixed easily but the larger implications are extremely troubling.....

JUMP FORWARD: I still never got a response but the price did go back down so I finally got my order and man, was it worth it! Considering the relative rarity of these films, particularly the third film, these are absolutely beautiful to look at. The English dubs are decent and the subtitles not too bad. Having said that, you can have a few hours worth of extra entertainment by putting the audio to the English dub and leaving the subtitles on so you can see just how different the two translations can be!  In some cases, the dialog is considerably different, even changing specific plot points on a couple of occasions! That's certainly not unique to the DAIMAJIN set and the subtitles aren't of the notoriously bad variety (see: NAKED KILLER for the funniest English subs of all time) but it's still amusing if you've got some time to kill or have some friends over and want to play MST3k: The Home Game.",1363219200,,1800,4.316568047337278

I had not seen the third movie in the series but was not dissappointed it is a well done movie. This is different from the Godzillas and Gammeras as it is told more in a fable form and is more serious than the kiddie fare that was becoming the genre in the sixties.

5169196,5,B008L0YMSW,These movies were made in 1966 and may be Japan's mythology on the universal theme of an inanimate object such as these statues made in stone- I am thinking of the Jewish mythology of the Golem made out of clay- which is designed by the common people to help them in times of tyranny.

5169197,4,B008L0YMSW,"Looks good, sounds good.  Menus easy to navigate.  If you don't know these movies, they are not like Godzilla ones.  Daimajin doesn't come into play until the end.  All three of these are like that - 9/10ths drama, 1/10th monster movie.  You should know that beforehand so you're not disappointed.  I enjoy that, and enjoy the character, and thought they were shot well, with great set pieces.  One star lost for the last movie, which I just couldn't stomach as well because it mostly followed a small group of children around.  If you've ever seen an old Gamera movie, you know how grating those overdubs for children can be in these Japanese movies.  I don't usually prefer overdubs, but in this case, the subtitles were very succinct, while the overdubs were more drawn out and more detailed in information, so I had both on.  Any future viewings, I'll definitely leave the overdubs off.",1357084800,2,890,4.758169934640523

5169204,4,B008L0YMSW,"I bought this on a whim, I have always enjoyed Toho/Kaiju films and thought this would be an interesting and different twist on the genre and in those regards I was pleasantly surprised...however.

These are not your typical kaiju films with mindless destruction and massive concerted efforts to stop the creature, there is more substance to these films than you're typical Godzilla movie. These films play out more like samurai films with an element of kaiju to them. In each of the three films involved, the Daimajin, basically a giant mountain spirit/guardian in the form of a giant warrior statue is talked about over the course of the movie in hushed whispers and reverence with some people fervently believing in his existence and others laughing it off as ignorance and legend.

In each of the three films there is some injustice, to which the people are oppressed and at some point during the film (usually the last 20-30 minutes) something happens that causes the daimajin to awaken and seek revenge, but the daimajin is unpredictable and just as likely to attack and harm the innocent as he is to punish the guilty. But, after that he goes back to slumbering or disappears and leaves the people shocked and amazed at what has transpired.

The effects are typical Toho fare with the obligatory man in the rubber suit the camera angles to make him appear massive which sometimes works better than you'd think and people running in fear as the colossus stomps its way through their town.

Overall, if you're a fan of samurai films I recommend this very very highly. As a kaiju film, I am torn, b/c what it does, it does very well, but when the whole premise of the films is the awesome semi evil daimajin and he shows up for all of 20 minutes it is sort of a letdown in that regard but for the samurai action and drama before that they're definitely good movies. Just don't go into these expecting Godzilla type destruction/action.",1355097600,6,1938,4.707964601769912
5169205,5,B008L0YMSW,"In order to compete with Toho Film studios Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra and many more giant monsters called ""kaiju"" Daiei created Gamera and  this very unique ""kaiju"" called Majin or Daimajin.
This set of 3 films were done in the same year by 3 different directors and released at different times of the year 1966.
Each with its own iteration of the Daimajin myth.
What made these films unique was they were set in historical times. Not among modern metropolitan areas.
And Daimajin himself was maybe 20 feet tall a somewhat ""realistic"" giant size.
These films not only tell a ghost/monster story but also preserve traditions and culture of old Japan.
One example is the practice of Ohaguro or dying the teeth black.
Many Japanese women historically did this when they got married.
And remastered in HD for Blu Ray you can see these details very clearly now, better than ever.

The image quality is amazing. Very clear and crisp.  A lot of care went into the remaster process.
When I first saw these films it was on a 27 inch 4x3 snowy picture on Creature Double Feature on a rainy Saturday morning.
Watching these Blu Rays gave me a better appreciation for what the film makers originally intended.
Yes I have the standard DVD box set as well.
I read a lot of bad reviews about the audio.  And to be honest, I don't think the original audio quality was ever very good.
But instead of trying to recreate the wheel, these remasters preserve the original 2.0 mix into HD.  And I like it.
It's a ghost story of despair and dark times.
Scratches and some hissing gives the film an eerie feel behind the haunting music soundtrack.

There are bonus features on disc 2 after the 3rd film.
Watch these films back to back or one at a time, each story is unique to it's own title.
And be amazed at how moder technology can bring back old screen gems as this like they were released this year.
I will not make the God of the Mountain angry, this set is a must have and I recommend it to anyone and everyone.
Even if you have the standard DVD box set, there is still improvements to the quality in these Blu Rays.

My only real complaint is that the two sequels tend to play very similar beats to the first.
