8588771,5,B0043AC5BU,"Not without its dramatic moments, this tongue in cheek hard-core art film is a worthwhile watch, if only for its vivid imagery and sense of humour.  Age old violence and sex parallels are showcased visually as tempting rubbish in your forgotten junk closet, the playground of ants. This is also a delightful story of two young sex slaves of a certain political public adversary.  It's curious and adorable; kawaii in all the right places.  Performance artist Sarah Weis gives an unshakeable performance.  Expect deflating political commentary and delicious, surreal visuals.  As our heroine might say, ""Oh bondage, up yours!""",1285286400,3,625,5.2727272727272725
