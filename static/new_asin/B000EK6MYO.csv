8110766,3,B000EK6MYO,"Not yet available on DVD and probably even forgotten by Brooke Shields herself, this odd little picture was co-written by Donald Cammell of Performance fame, and he's the reason I picked it up. With hints of liberated sexuality at its edges (in the opening scene, ""Tilt"" the teenage pinball queen played by Shields hitches a ride with a trucker and scares him away by suggesting they have an orgy with his wife!), the film Tilt is still very chaste and is really a family picture. I'm glad I watched it because it gives another credit to a real mystery man (Cammell), but don't expect too much.  Shields and Charles Durning give fine performances.",1174780800,14,647,4.725663716814159
