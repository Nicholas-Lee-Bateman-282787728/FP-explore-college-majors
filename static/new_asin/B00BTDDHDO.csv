8573576,5,B00BTDDHDO,"My wife and I watched this movie together, once, and she, not a fan of war movies, found most of it boring and hard to follow, yet she kept watching it, and was touched by the ending.

I've watched it repeatedly, and, as a military retiree, I find this film to be very credible, although it is fictitious.

The wars continually waged against Latin drug lords and Islamic jihadists are, in my opinion, the Free World's greatest threats - not global warming or climate change, as liberal actors and politicians would have us believe. This film depicts these greater threats and conflicts in a very professional manner.",1467158400,,616,4.747663551401869
8573577,5,B00BTDDHDO,Who said Seals can't act? We wouldn't mind seeing a lot more (non-actors) telling their stories.,1464825600,,96,5.0625

8573581,5,B00BTDDHDO,"Loved the fact that these ""actors"" are the real deal.  Made the film all the more riveting.",1418083200,,91,4.352941176470588
8573582,5,B00BTDDHDO,"My wife & I thought this was a great movie.  We liked it a lot better than ""Lone Survivor"".  Even if most of the actors weren't ""real"" actors, but REAL Seals, we thought the movie was well done.  Yes, some of the dialog seemed a bit stilted and loaded with military jargon, but so what.  It was a great story and filmed well.  The music also added to the quality of the film.",1415750400,,375,4.082191780821918
