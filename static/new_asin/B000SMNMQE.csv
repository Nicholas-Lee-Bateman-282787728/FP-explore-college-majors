2888010,5,B000SMNMQE,"I live in the UK and when this series was first televised over here I used to stay up and watch it relidgiously ever time it was on. I just cannot understand why it is taking so long for it to be put onto DVD so 'us' people who loved the series can yet injoy it again. And also why is there other television series that do not come anywhere near the greatness of this programme are already showing on DVD. It is certainly up there with the likes of 'Dallas', 'Dynasty', 'Knotts Landing' 'Lost', etc, etc, etc,............some of the 'greats' of the past few years. SO, please put 'us' Midnight Caller fans out of our misery and release it soon on DVD.",1203465600,11,651,4.300813008130081
2888011,5,B000SMNMQE,"In a TV universe full of drivel my liver quivered with delight when viewing the Midnight Caller TV show.

I believe the show lasted a mere three years which is not surprising what with TV having to lean towards the least common denominator.

Midnight Caller, in my unadulterated opinion, tended to attract the more intelligent viewer. That right there eliminates 85 percent of Americans!!!

Sigh...........From a crotchety cantankerous old coot whose TV staring is around 90 percent History Channel, Discovery, various National Geographic specials and sundry other non-fiction fare, Midnight Caller was among one of the few fictional TV shows that grabbed and held my attention.

I hereby and forewith implore, demand, shout out for and generally insist that the powers that be make the series available upon those round shiny things I can plop into my round shiny thing player and re-live the wondrous nights I stared at the TV screen and was actually entertained vice being disgusted by the inane drivelly froth aimed at the huddled unwashed masses yearning for entertainment at a 6th-grade level.",1202860800,23,1099,5.192090395480226
2888012,5,B000SMNMQE,I loved this televison series when it was on. It was one of my favorite shows. I was very sad when it went off the air.  I have been searching for the DVD release for 3 years now.  Please release the DVD already!  Thanks  Vivian,1196380800,23,228,4.0

2888014,5,B000SMNMQE,"A TV series that lasted a few seasons, but should have gone on longer.  The pilot was the seller of this series which was based on a late-night talk radio host (Gary Cole) who, with his trusty engineer (Dennis Dun) and hot station manager (Wendy Kilbourne), always seemed to get involved in crimes of the heart or San Francisco (locale for the shoot).  Cole's character was en ex-cop who quit the force in the wake of his partner's death while on a case and decided he could help people via the airwaves with the help of his detective friend (Arthur Taxier).  The shows music (especially the theme music) was very jazzy and helped to set the mood for the weekly story line.  I miss it!",1189814400,35,685,4.456
2888015,5,B000SMNMQE,"I loved this show growing up. I loved hearing Gary Cole spreading his words of wisdom on the radio in the early hours of the morning with his thought provoking comments and putting the world to rights. ABSOLUTE BLISS! It made me feel like the world was a better place with old Gary in charge lol. A great show, very entertaining and very well written with a brilliant cast and a very charismatic lead role in Gary Cole aka Jack Killian. THE BEST!

2888016,5,B000SMNMQE,"I've watched some bootleg episodes of this ground breaking series again (yes I paid $69 to that site, and received 25  out of 61 episodes copied from a VHS tape) and it is surprising how cutting edge it was for a network TV series back in the eighties. They covered Aids, Gun control, the San Francisco earthquake etc. in a thoughtful and thought provoking way, so unusual for US mainstream shows of that era. Some come on NBC, do your stuff and release this series!!",1384128000,,467,4.4941176470588236

2888020,5,B000SMNMQE,"I am so ready for Midnight Caller to come out on DVD. I never missed a show!!!! My favorite episode was when a female friend of Jack's comes to his house to stay to be safe. They end up sleeping together and as they walked into the bedroom, she asked him if this was a good idea. His answer was ""We're just two friends, sharing the night together.""

2888024,5,B000SMNMQE,"I can't believe that this brilliant tv show has never been available on dvd.  Gary Cole was made for this role.

2888026,5,B000SMNMQE,Oh how I loved this show!! I just remember Tuesday nights at 10pm solving crimes with Jack and his studio engineer. This was one of the best mystery shows of all times. The DVD release is long overdue.,1351036800,,201,4.315789473684211
2888027,5,B000SMNMQE,"This series was brilliant and as so many other shows was cancelled long before its time. The characters were deep and showed the weaknesses and strengths of real people. I have followed Gary Coles career ever since. The stories were not only entertaining but touching. I have seen lots of tv shows, but very few have caused me such impact.

This show definetely deserves a DVD release and to the studio bosses I will only say one word: Firefly! Best proof, that  more than once a premature cancellation can be a huge mistake. Firefly made so much money on dvd that it got funding for a big screen movie. Thing about it if 21 years after Midnight Caller's cancellation people are still screaming for the DVD....",1349827200,,710,4.626984126984127
2888028,5,B000SMNMQE,"PLEASE release all 3 seasons of this fantastic show.  We (Alice and I ) have been anxiously awaiting the release of this show on DVD.  We will purchase it immediately upon release.  We loved Gary Cole in this show ; we never missed a show.
Thank you.",1349222400,,250,4.276595744680851
2888029,5,B000SMNMQE,"We got this show over here in the UK. I loved it, especially the music, that dark seductive jazz trumpet in the opening theme tune, pure gold.

I guess somebody somewhere is blocking the release of this on DVD for whatever reason. It's much the same for Disney's Song of the South. This touching movie was a part of my childhood but as it has a slave as a main character the nanny state says I can't watch it. I wonder if Midnight Caller is in the same category as it dared to tackle some big topics at the time which the nanny state of today probably thinks would offend.

Whatever happened to freedom to choose ?",1348012800,2,614,4.239316239316239
2888030,5,B000SMNMQE,"Midnight Caller is a compelling TV series that straddled the late 80s and early 90s.  The story lines never lacked interest and the characters made this a great series.  Why, or why, isn't this show on DVD?  OK, no doubt there are music issues, etc, but really, if Saved by the Bell can be inflicted on the DVD viewing audience, then surely we viewers of good taste can get justice by getting our serve of Midnight Caller on DVD!  Please bring Midnight Caller to DVD!!!",1344124800,,469,4.482352941176471
2888031,4,B000SMNMQE,"I've been searching for a DVD of this series for at least the last 5 years and keep seeing the notation that it's not available yet. Will somebody please tells us why we have to keep waiting? Is there a legal problem with ownership or a struggle over royalties? Let's get it resolved like now, rather than after I'm dirt-napping.

I loved the show and watched every episode even though I had to admit that there were parts of the show that were very unrealistic. Having worked in radio, when you're on the overnight shift, the station manager is never going to be there observing you, you're not that important a person when you're put on overnights. I could see the manager (Wendy Kilbourne) being there if this was a day shift, even if it was an evening shift, but the show needed that night-time edge for its plot backdrop so the writers had to suspend some realism in order to embelish the show.

For its time the show pushed the envelope as much as it could, but by today's standards it might seem tame. One of the funniest moments of the show - and one which took me by surprise in pushing said envelope - was in the final season when Wendy was pregnant and Gary Cole offered to marry her. They talked about naming the baby. Remember that moment? He says the kid should be named Jack King. Wendy balks at the idea and says something like ""think about it, Jack King"" and then that light bulb goes off when Cole realizes what he had said...priceless, and something I'm surprised had been accepted by the censors. I was rolling on the floor after that. I'm sure there were other great moments, too, but that one was probably the most memorable to me.

Now all that aside, if the morons who are holding this DVD up are reading these reviews, get off your duffs and put these shows out on DVD while you have an audience base that will buy them. And puleaze don't bastardize the music like what was done with WKRP and cry poor that you can't pay royalties. Much as I love KRP, I won't buy it until they come out with copies with the original music since that was central to the show.",1341187200,10,2083,4.36340206185567

2888041,5,B000SMNMQE,"I was thoroughly impressed when this show first aired. Gary Cole had appeared in an episode of Miami Vice and then to go to his own series, it was a great leap! And the show was so believable too. I looked forward, with anticipation, each week that it was on. Come on, bring this to disc already! Update: I was able to find this online to watch hee hee. I'm sure Gary Cole doesn't care that it's online for people to watch - only certain big wig types. Happy watching :)",1284249600,2,470,4.175824175824176

2888043,5,B000SMNMQE,"I, like all other reviews, am waiting for ""Midnight Caller"" to come out in DVD.  I am hoping that Amazon.com will forward our pleas or please, to the appropriate companies that will do the most good.  I also agree that they should bring it back with a newer, older - (sorry Gar) and wiser, Jack Killian (oh I do want it to be Gary Cole of course, NO ONE else, could be the Nighthawk).  I do believe that there was always a statement in each episode.  I also feel that it was a story 'before it's time'.  There have been many DVD's out there that bombed. I can't see this happening.  Yet on one website they're saying that this TV series is way up there on the waiting list to be put on DVD.  Along with the TNT Series ""Wanted"" which also stared Gary Cole.  Almost ever Series on TV now is on DVD. Oh and I want the above reviewer to know that the Alf Series is on a DVD because I have it.  Our son gave it to my husband a few years ago, he thinks he bought it on Amazon.com. I hope this is helpful.

Getting back to Midnight Caller?  Please, I would love it as a Christmas gift um, 2010, not 2020.

And in regards to the person that is selling the Series.  I believe you're right, it is questionable and unauthorized.  One person didn't receive their merchandise and the provider (also questionable) said it was unfair that they rate it because they hadn't received the product yet.  All the rest of the reviews were excellent.  Never saw that before. Probably wrote them himself. The one website I saw was out of the country and could not guarantee when it would be delivered.  NOT GOOD.

I love this show!  I want the DVD.  Am I too demanding???

Thanks for listening.",1278201600,6,1670,4.254777070063694
2888044,5,B000SMNMQE,"I can't wait to see the whole series on DVD.  It was one of the best TV show ever since I'm a San Francisco resident plus was an extra in one of the episode.  I agree with most of the reviewers with all the junks on DVD, it is a real shame this series hasn't been released on DVD for 2 decades.",1277337600,4,294,3.725806451612903
2888045,5,B000SMNMQE,"Agreeing with pretty much everyone else here: Midnight Caller WAS a thoughtful, provocative, exciting (in it's own subdued way) show!  I, too, would very much like to see it on DVD.  However, that will probably never happen -- at least ""officially""...and here's why: MONEY!  Back in the 80's when contracts were written for this production, they likely included provisions only for syndication (if even that!).  In order to officially release this to DVD, the distributor would have to go back to the studio, the production company and even individual actors and write new contracts to give each of them their cut.  This appears to have been done for some larger ""hits"" (""Miami Vice"" and ""The A Team"" come to mind) so that they're at least available for streaming on network or cable provider on-demand websites.  Nowadays, DVD (and on-line/on-demand and so forth) are all foregone conclusions and the possibilities are all addressed up front in all contracts; this is why current series are able to be released season by season to DVD...even while the series is still on the air!

Actually, this would probably be a good little business for someone on the west coast with the right connections: spend all day tracking down all the interested parties and writing new contracts to release such titles on DVD (or on-line/on-demand).  With nostalgia being so big currently, there'd probably be a large enough market if someone were willing to put the time in to it -- because we all know that there's not a company willing to do so.

Until then, you just have to hope you get lucky like I did with WKRP: I bought the whole series (all four seasons PLUS some additional bonus clips including an ""Entertainment Tonight"" special) for $50 from someone who truly loved the series...and was obviously a bootleg (many episodes had a local affiliate's logo ""slate"" pop up during commercial breaks).  It was poor quality (think VHS and then worse) and came with plain white labels in LOOSE plastic sleeves, but at least I got to see all my favorite episodes!  ""It's the phone cops!  They know what I did to their phone!"" -- Johnny Fever, running from the real cops sent to warn him of a bomb in the transmitter after he busted up the phone with a tool box (containing the bomb) because he couldn't get a hold of his bookie",1274745600,3,2310,4.761904761904762
2888046,4,B000SMNMQE,"this is just one more example of NBC being headed up by morons.  this show was awesome.  i was 12 when it was out, but has always been one of my favorite shows and i always check around to see if it is ever released. ive managed to find a few bootlegs of shows every now and again, but you think that NBC would get the hint being that every one of their current shows they have suck...and after the conan and jay issue, theyd listen to the fans.  dennis dun is the man, its gary cole before he was known, and wendie...oh wendie... release it already",1268179200,5,549,4.11214953271028
2888047,5,B000SMNMQE,"I just saw Gary Cole in a role on ""The Good Wife"" and was reminded of how much I enjoyed his earlier series ""Midnight Caller"".  This was a wonderful series, low key and intelligent, sexy, thoughtful.  Why don't they bring it out on DVD/Blue Ray?  They put all kinds of junk out there, why not something of quality?",1267488000,3,314,4.379310344827586
2888048,5,B000SMNMQE,"I just recently was able to purchase some old copies of this series. I was already a big Gary Cole fan and looking for as much material as I could find. What a treat! Mr. Cole in a great series that knew how to utilize his exceptional talent. Of course what I have is out of order and varying in quality, but boy, what a fantastic actor--makes me wish all the more that American Gothic had made it to at least one more season.

But this show was definitely a hit and I can't understand why it hasn't been brought to DVD--aside from the excellent acting by Gary and his fellow actors, the subject matter was in some ways even way ahead of what's being done today because the depth of the social issues dealt with are less sensationalistic and focus more on the issue itself than the characters who portray the varying sides of the issues addressed. The themes seem to resonate more with me than they do in current series such as Law and Order--not to take anything away from those excellent programs, but there's something that hits home with me more in Midnight Caller. There seems to be an introspection to the characters that rings more true for its directness  and is less weighted down than in current dramas where there's a certain self-consciousness to the performances. Somehow, I'm more able to get lost in the drama of Midnight Caller--maybe it was the period of time and the lack of conscious sophistication, and political import...don't know, but I really wish this series would be brought to DVD so I can see it in its entirety and get my Gary Cole fix all at the same time--without the bad VHS to DVD visuals.

Anyway, here's hoping it'll make it to DVD before the next decade is out--don't those studios read these reviews? Maybe I should click my heels three times....",1259625600,11,1783,4.531055900621118

2888060,5,B000SMNMQE,I just found the series DVD set advertised on DVD Adventure TV website. It states that the regular price is $[...] but it's on sale for $[...]. This is for all 61 episodes. I found the set one other time. I can't remember the website; but it mentioned something about the dvd format not being compatible with all DVD players. It just seems strange to me that I've only found this on one website. Why wouldn't it be on a website like Amazon.com. Do you think it's legit?,1213401600,4,469,4.340909090909091
2888061,5,B000SMNMQE,"I found a few excerpts from Midnight Caller on YouTube last night, and now I'm in a fever to buy and watch the whole shebang once more. The 1980's were great for worthwhile tv viewing. Midnight Caller with Gary Cole is at the top of my wish list.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Caller-TV-Series/dp/B000SMNMQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Caller (TV Series)</a>

I watched Midnight Caller religiously from the first episode until it was canceled prematurely.  At the time, it was the one tv series on my ""must watch"" list. Jack Killian is one of Gary Cole's most memorable roles, and I loved the chemistry between him and Wendy Kilbourne. Now is the time to release this wonderful show on dvd so all of its old fans and the new ones to come can relive some glories of yesteryear.",1212192000,6,838,5.3893129770992365
2888062,5,B000SMNMQE,"So much junk comes out on DVD, why don't they release this and let all of us longtimefans indulge? The disatrous ""Lipstick Jungle"" just came out on DVD. Shows that last one SEASON are available (who buys them?) yet we have been w/o this gem for more than a decade. If only Lifetime or some cable entity would air the episodes, that would help. But a nice DVD set with Jack and Devon, and later, Nicky, of Lt. Zymack, and Deacon covering the story, of the recurring and new characters that absorbed our interest, would be a service to all Midnight Caller fans. The recorded-from-broadcast VHS tapes, the old heavy kind, grow fainter each year. This show that aired before TiVo existed needs to return so we can enjoy quality drama for a change.",1210204800,11,743,4.552238805970149
2888063,5,B000SMNMQE,"This was one of my favorite TV shows when it was on.  I wish they would release the show on DVD.  Gary Cole's performance as Jack Killian was so belivable.  I never missed a week. He and Wendy Kilbourne had an electric chemistry.  This would sell big, I believe.

8206021,5,B000SMNMQE,"Like all the other reviewers, I would love to see this series issued on DVD at long last. I have such great memories of the series with its memorable characters and strong story lines.
In the absence of an official release, a few years ago I did buy a set of DVDs from ioffer but they were practically unwatchable due to the poor picture quality so buyer beware if you are thinking of trying that route. However, there are now better quality copies available through the wonders of streaming and I am enjoying the show all over again - but I would still love the opportunity to buy an official release.",1517961600,,602,4.4324324324324325

8206023,5,B000SMNMQE,"Why cant we get this show anywhere?  I was even prepared to start a paid subscription to Hulu or Prime or Netflix to watch just this show but its not anywhere.  I would buy the DVD's.  This show aired in 1988-1991 and we are still talking about it in 2016 surely NBC etc can see there is a market, is it really that hard to head down to the room with all the masters rip them onto disc and put them out for all of us to buy.  We don't need 'director narrations' 'dolby digital surround sound"" we just want the same episodes that aired on TV back when VHS was king.  Someone tried to offer me a bootleg recording from the VHS for 100 pounds.....I declined but obviously the market is paying top dollar, let us buy legitimate copies we have waited long enough for this great show.",1466208000,15,778,4.194630872483222

8206026,5,B000SMNMQE,"These are TV recordings as it has never been released on DVD, I do not ever expect it to be released but I may be wrong. Mine are from mostly English and some Canadian TV recordings, some still have the old funny adds in. The rights are owned by a very large American Channel who have not released a genuine DVD set, they protect there rights. That is why you cannot find even copies online for sale.

 Great show used to watch this very late at night, it used to come on after prisoner cell block H(bad acting and wobbly set's)",1401926400,2,528,4.217821782178218
8206027,5,B000SMNMQE,"This show was fantastic.  Gary Cole is an incredible actor that made the show something you wanted to watch.
I'm praying (NBC - Distributor) will release DVDs on this show - I for one will purchase all three seasons.
The production companies were December 3rd Production, Gangbuster Films Inc. & Lorimar Television.
