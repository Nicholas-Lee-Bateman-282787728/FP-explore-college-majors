8487164,4,B005UYWGZS,"This is a review of just the 1929 black and white Bulldog Drummond film about Bulldog Drummond, a World War I veteran whose name was Captain Hugh Drummond. This was the first talkie for Colman. Most silent movie actors lost their jobs when films were made with sound because of their voice, but Colman had a pleasant distinctive and likable voice and after making this first talkie, he became even more famous than before and remained so until he retired in 1957. Since was a talkie, the producer of the film had an Irish Tenor sing a nice song in the film. The film is somewhat granny, but still easy to see, and it is fun, despite some of the actors using the same heavy-handed gestures and movements and facial looks they used in silent films.
The Bulldog Drummond books and films were quite popular at the time this 1929 film was made. There were two silent films about him before 1929. Drummond was a debonair English man, rich, and in this film he was searching for adventure because he was bored. He put an ad in a newspaper offering to help anyone if it involved him in an adventure. A woman came to him seeking his help. She said her uncle was being held captive.",1499644800,3,1172,4.430555555555555

8487168,5,B005UYWGZS,"If you love classic films and watch either the classic-movie channels on cable or perhaps you've collected some DVDs from the 1930s and 1940sthen you've probably encountered the prolific Bulldog Drummond film series. I've got several of those big, inexpensive collections of classic films (those boxed sets with ""50 films"" or even ""100 films"") and some of the mid-career Drummond movies are often plopped into those sets. But, if you've only sampled those middle films in the series, then you're missing the real cultural innovationthe ""sensation""that Drummond represented in his 1920 fictional debut and later his 1929 all-talking movie debut.

Here's the context of the character: World War I had ended and countless veterans were returning home, forever marked by the brutalities of war. That's the era in which H.C. ""Sapper"" McNeile began sketching his famous character in breathless prose. Drummond was a big, strong, well-to-do man who knew how to fight and today we might call him an adrenaline junkie after the brutal war years. In Sapper's debut novel, the idle-rich Drummond places an advertisement in a newspaper, begging for something exciting to do with his life. Thus begins his career as a sort of detective and all-around hero for hire.

Even before the sound era dawned, producers were rushing to depict Drummond on the silver screen. Of course, they quickly abandoned Sapper's insistence that Drummond was a sort of big-hearted bruiser with an ugly face, including a broken nose. Moviemakers wanted their heroes to be heart throbs. And, by the spring of 1929less than a year after the advent of ""all-talking pictures"" with the feature film ""Lights of New York""the first big all-talking Drummond movie was in theaters with full audio and sound effects! The handsome Ronald Coleman turned Sapper's hero into an urbane white knight willing to risk his life against all dangers to save the innocent. And, yes, this particular film shows Drummond drafting that fateful newspaper advertisement and beginning his career. Apparently, the producers felt the silent versions of his story would be quickly forgotten. This 1929 film is the official ""start"" of his storyat least for audiences wanting audio with their moving pictures.

Some viewers may dismiss the first film on this two-disc set as not worth the money. It may even seem silly if you don't appreciate what you're seeing here in terms of an innovation in suspenseful storytelling. I think thatknowing the context of what you're seeing on the screen hereit's a wonderful, fun-to-watch milestone. The plot twists are campy to the point of seeming laughable today. There's a mad scientist who sprawls the unconscious leading lady on his laboratory workbench and begins to paw her. There are clanging steel doors with a secret switch to operate them. There are terrifyingly disheveled henchmen who scamper through the night.

It's not a spoiler to say that, in this movie, the architect of evil manages to elude Drummond in the end of this film, leaving a friendly note inviting further adventures. If you've heard anything about this series, then you know Drummond pursues the villain through several novels (and movie adventures) before there is any hope of vanquishing him.

I was impressed with the digital version of this film. It's not a pristine, fully restored version of the film, but it is crisp and clear and great fun to watch. The entertainment value here really lies in the ability to hiss and cheer and jump at the surprises. Campy as all get outbut, truth be told, when this movie debuted in its first run, critics were impressed. Even the New York Times praised the movie! In 1929, this all came acrosswith the full force of soundas very exciting stuff. Remember that in 1929, the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock was still five years away from producing his landmarks of the genre: The original Man Who Knew Too Much and in 1935 The 39 Steps.

The second film in this particular DVD set jumps ahead in the movie series 22 years to 1951, which also represents moving from 1st sound movie in the series (after 2 silent movies) to the 19th sound film, and also represents a jump ahead to the 9th actor to portray Drummond in the sound era: Walter Pigeon. (And some of the intervening Drummonds were no slouches, including Ralph Richardson and Ray Milland!)

The setseen from this perspectiveshows us not only what all the excitement was about at the dawn of the sound era when this very popular character finally jumped onto the silver screen with a complete soundtrackall the way toward the tail end of the series (2 more films would follow in the 1960s). You'll see the scope of this very durable Hollywood hero.

Oh andby the wayI've got three of those cheaply priced jam-packed sets of old movies on DVD that have at least some Drummond films included in the mix. And none of those sets has the Ronald Coleman version. Look around, because Drummond movies are widely available, but I consider this two-movie set a real gem and well worth the price.",1488153600,10,5037,4.952662721893491
