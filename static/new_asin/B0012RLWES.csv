8247485,3,B0012RLWES,"Collectors of vintage TV comedy are the ones who'll especially relish this release from Alpha, one of THE BEST companies when it comes to 1950's television obscurities.  This DVD includes the pilots for four sitcoms, which for various reasons never quite made it into regular series.

MEET THE O'BRIENS - Very charming show, which casts Dave O'Brien as an unemployed (and mostly unwelcome) son-in-law, who constantly strives to curry his father-in-law's favour, but always ends up wrecking things instead.  This show did have a potential but the constant bumbling antics of O'Brien would have worn thin over time.  The lovely Jeff Donnell is O'Brien's wife.

THE JOE E. BROWN SHOW - Homespun charm is the term which best sums up this show.  Joe E. Brown, that cuddly-wuddly character actor best remembered for his turns in such movies as ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""Show Boat"", is the owner of a sleepy general store in a tight-knit small town.  It plays like an early prototype of Paul Henning's ""Petticoat Junction"", and might very well have been a success if it had instead been included in that special clutch of early Sixties 'rural' sitcoms.

LET'S JOIN JOANIE - Joan Davis and her trademark slapstick antics were always good value, but this show starts out at such a high volume that it would have been nigh-impossible for her to maintain the frantic pace!  In this show, Joan is a young woman with a messy crush on her next-door neighbour (Joe Flynn).  In an effort to capture his attention, she fakes ""purple plague"" at the hatshop where she works, and enrolls in a nearby health farm.  It has some marvellous moments and really picks up the pace once Joan arrives at the health farm, but it reeks of ""filmed stage play"".  In any case, Joan later went on to the more successful ""I Married Joan"", which also built upon her physical comedy skills but balanced them with a more sustainable, age-appropriate story premise.

OPERATION E.S.P. - Firstly, what a cool title for a TV show!  And starts out quite promisingly too (quality wise it's probably the best programme on the disc).  From what I've been able to tell, this was only ever meant to be a one-off story for the 1952 anthology show ""Your Jeweler's Showcase"", but might have made for an interesting regular series.  Sheldon Leonard stars with Barbara Whiting and Jack Kruschen.

""Meet The O'Briens"" (Failed TV Pilot)
""The Joe E. Brown Show""
""Let's Join Joanie"" (Failed TV Pilot)
""Operation ESP""

The 4 programs are fun to watch, But they are hardly the best place to start for somebody just learning about 50's TV. The picture quality ranges from average to poor, But that is to be expected with such rare contents. ""Let's Join Joanie"" is notable for starring Joan Davis before she did ""I Married Joan"", But the pilot is forgettable and wastes her talent. Overall it isn't a bad DVD, But don't judge 50's TV by it.
Recommmend to those who like rare TV, or want to see some lesser-known 50's comedy.",1205625600,,652,4.572649572649572
