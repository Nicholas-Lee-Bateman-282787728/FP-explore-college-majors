8494608,5,B006841LKU,"Our kids from 1st grade on up to 5th and our teachers enjoyed this. It has plenty of humor and lots of info. It's fun, educational, and well formatted. It was a lot for our Sunday School hour and some of the activities were better than others, as is usually the case. We really enjoyed it and are looking into using more What's in the Bible curriculum or at least videos in the future.",1390608000,,385,4.216216216216216
