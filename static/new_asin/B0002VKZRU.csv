2127564,5,B0002VKZRU,"If you are drawn to End Time prophecies, this movie provides an interesting approach to the usual scenario.
Beginning with terrorists acts on American soil, the fast moving plot explores the enforcement of a national identity using a microchip inserted in the hand, thus creating a Police State. College campuses across the country proves to be a fertile environment to corrupt young minds in this case and when young Christians rally fearing the rise of the Anti Christ, they are immediately labeled objectors and hunted down.
That in a nutshell is Rumors of War, a Dove Foundation approved movie depicting a chilly world, ours in fact if we do not awake to the disastrous consequences of today's actions.

A surprisingly good movie, better than most of this genre in fact, I give it 5 stars as the entertainment and the acting will provide some interesting discussions among Church and none church groups alike.

2127568,4,B0002VKZRU,"Rumors of Wars is a really interesting, suspenseful drama. I like how they show two different stories. One shows a college student and how she keeps a diary of the events happening in her life and how she tries to escape from the people forcing a chip into her hand. She studies about the end times and writes everything down.
  The second story is happens years later. It tells of all of the mayhem and trouble with the end times. How Christians are captured and killed. How no one wants the Christians around. They blame all of the troubles of the modern age on the Christians. One solider finds her diary and reads it. Its amazing what a few words can do to a person.
  Quite a good movie that will start you thinking and make you want to change for the better. Very good end times story. I recommend this for all groups.

Imagine a world where the technology will revolutionize the way we buy and sell and even maintain our health and fitness. As technology advances, RFID chips will be the wave of the future. Fear of identity theft now removed; maintaining your health information without the hassle of doctors keeping paper records will be a thing of the past. Taking food stamps, welfare and government benefits and incorporating them into a small embedded chip is now here. You can even get discounts instantly on the places you shop the most without the inconvenience of carrying paper coupons or even leaving them at home. Maintain your stress levels and BMI's effortlessly and even counting calories now a thing of the past. Get yours today at a local Zurn center today!

Sound like something from a science fiction movie or merely a chilling look at what might be our future staring right at us. Think of the ability to prevent terrorist attacks because we can instantly locate anyone who has received the RFID chip and even track who is purchasing items that might be used in a terrorist threat. No more missing persons, because they can instantly be located like a Find Phone app!

In the DVD release of Rumors of Wars, Word Films takes a chilling look at the future where the government is in the process of rounding up citizens who haven't received the RFID chip to ensure the end of the terrorist attacks that are happening all over the US. Religious zealots are to blame for their division against the government control. The National Defense Authorization Act has been approved and now allows the Alliance, a military police force, to ensure that all comply or be killed. Martial law is unleashed to help find the religious rebels and their leaders to bring their war to an end.

But is it all one big cover up to some sick plan to control the population? The housing and financial economic collapse along with terrorist plots part of something bigger going on to do whatever it takes to plant fear into the minds of the American people? Society's end is just the beginning. Just another conspiracy theory? You decide!

I received Rumors of Wars compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. Except for the free copy of the DVD,  I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed here are strictly my own. This is such a great movie that takes Bible Prophecy and showcases a possible ""what if"" scenario. Starring Eric Roberts (Heroes) and Ben Davies (Courageous) this movie takes a look at the possible way the Mark of the Beast of Revelation might be played out in the present day. It truly shows you how simple technology would make the implementation of such a system possible. The movie runs 89 minutes and is Dove Family Approved. There are some great special features like interviews, an indepth look at the diary Roxy carries, character profiles and much much more. I easily rate this one a 4.5 out of 5 stars.",1416182400,28,3018,4.728136882129277
2127570,4,B0002VKZRU,"""Rumors of War"" is not a bad post-apocalyptic or dystopic movie.  It does have a religious and Christians flavor to it and follows a rough dispensational interpretation of end times.  But it is not really preachy and is far better than the ""Revelation Road"" series.

Positives:
Surprisingly good acting from actors and actresses I have not seen before.
Most of the clothing and uniforms were appropriate to the setting and did not seem clownish.
Architecture for the post apocalyptic places was pretty gritty and interesting.
Not preachy, yet did present spiritual elements as a part of human existence.
Had a female church leader in a positive role.
Racially diverse cast.

Negatives:
A bit heavy handed by showing the news from CBN, rather than making up a news channel or showing some recognized news outlet.  I do not think of Christian Broadcasting Network as a primarily news channel.
Plot was told in two segments.  One was the future where a soldier finds a journal along with ""prohibited materials"" and questions his own allegiance to the powers in charge.  The other story line was about the college student who wrote the journal.  The film flips back and forth in time between those two plot lines.
The ""mark of the beast"" was an implanted RF chip.  If you have watched any of these kinds of end times thrillers, then you may remember that movies of these sort have identified the ""mark of the beast"" as bar codes, credit cards, and various other things like that.  This RF chip is just the latest technology to be called the ""mark of the beast.""  In this film the characters can just chop out the chip as they desire.
The nurse uniforms were ridiculous and looked like a throw back to the 1950s.  Totally ruined the flavor of those scenes.  Nurses in most places would be wearing scrubs and that would have added to a more realistic feel, and still set the nurses apart.
There did seem to be an undercurrent of men in dominant positions of power, as opposed to women being leaders.  The female church leader was the exception.
No female soldiers or troopers in the ranks of the ""bad guys.""

Overall I give ""Rumors of War"" a B-.",1415836800,12,2139,4.681818181818182

2127572,4,B0002VKZRU,"Although I liked this DVD very much, it suffers from the same problem as a previous item I reviewed, Galaxy Fraulien Yuna: Being based on a video game series, it assumes the audience is already thoroughly familliar with the basic plot/premise of the story.  It mainly serves to ""flesh out"" the characters already established by SEGA in their popular series of Japanese games.  If you have also seen the 25-episode TV version, the considerable differences in characterazation may also seem confusing.

This OVA is the first of several, and deals with the establishment of the Imperial Flower Troupe/Division of supernaturally-endowed maidens who oppose the Forces of Darkness in their ill-defined attacks on Imperial Tokyo.  The six principal characters are introduced and given barely enough screen time to tell them apart in the 4 different episodes that make up this DVD.  The Forces of Darkness are virtually ignored and their motive is murky at best.  The original episodes were released separately in Japan, and the loose story line and connection between the segments was somehow not thought to be a shortcoming, supplementing as it does the storyline of the games.

Although the characters are rather sketchy in the OVA, some manage to stand out; I particularly liked the main character, Sakura, voiced by Chisa Yokoyama, probably best known as Sasami in the various incarnations of the Tenchi Muyo! world.  She is the ""new girl"" in the combat/theatrical troupe, and has to go through the familliar routines of trying to fit in, after mastering a difficult sword technique which reminded me very much of that used by Motoko in Love Hina.  As I mentioned, the characterizations here differ considerably from the longer TV series; I find that I actually prefer these: they're not as tragic, dark, conflicted, and neurotic, allowing more room for natural humor and interactions between the girls.

As usual for an OVA, the animation is far superior to that in the regular TV series, which has been harshly criticized.  The music is also very good.  The main claim for this particular reissue is the 5.0 sound on the english dubbed track.  I find this first version of Sakura Wars ( Sakura Taisen in Japanese ) to be an enjoyable expansion and alternative view of the characters established in the games and popularized by the TV series.",1188864000,4,2340,5.015503875968992

The characters are likable and compelling for what it is.  It also incorporates generic conspiracy theories, dated/worn sci-fi technology, and histocial precedents such as false flag events (e.g. burning of the Reichstag) to move the plot along.

Even though I disagree with pre-tribulation dispensational theology I generally enjoyed this movie.  The acting gets a B-.  The story gets a B-.  The cinematography and production polish gets a A-.

2127634,4,B0002VKZRU,"Usually Christian films really bad--bad acting, low budget, preachy. This is more realistic than most. My only gripe is that they set it outside Chicago and bombed a military installation nearby. One of the characters lost her fiance in the bombing, and he was in the USAF. There is no USAF base near Chicago, only a navy training base 30ish miles north. Apart from a research error, I thought the acting was good, not stilted and overdone like you see in most Christian films. They didn't shy away from violence, the bad guys used light profanity (which is in keeping with the characters), and it was interesting to see the perspective of both sides. The villains really thought they were saving the world. I'd advise parents to watch it first before showing it to little kids because some of the characters get beaten, and there is blood, but if your kids play video games with shooting they'll have seen worse than this has.

The plot was OK, but it took way to long to get to the turning point, although no explanation of what was going on was needed because everything is so painfully obvious. I'm not hating on it being a religious movie as I am a Christian myself, but I can see how a non-Christian would be turned off because everything is so blatant and obvious.

2127641,5,B0002VKZRU,"This is a great movie about how the future might really happen; however, it loses focus of a few things;  Jesus Christ was never Religious, and this is what started the Religious people hating Him in the beginning of His time in Jerusalem, and Jesus Christ never preached for He was never a preacher because He was really a teacher; therefore, when Jesus Christ began His teachings He was always around the common people and not in the Holy places of the Religious people, and this greatly angered the Religious people who believed Him to be a false prophet; therefore, the Religious people started calling Jesus Christ an Alcoholic Winebibber Glutton always celebrating with the sinners, and people that were not Religious were called sinners by the Religious people; thus, the Religious people called Jesus Christ a false prophet because the Religious people thought of Him as a sinner, and this greatly angered Jesus Christ until one day Jesus Christ went in their Holy place and tore it up knocking over tables, and kicking over chairs, and hitting people with the bird cages screaming, ""You Hypocrites!""  The bird cages just happened to be some of the things Jesus Christ was throwing at the Religious people, and the reason the bird cages were there was you would buy a bird, and cast your sins upon the bird, and set the bird free, and you were allowed to now believe that you were free from your sins; it is a practice still used today in Religions, but it is not birds in the modern World; it usually is some sort of other practice; for example, saying so many Hail Marys, and then you are allowed to believe that you are now free from your sins.  Therefore, when Jesus Christ tore up the Holy place of the Religious people they screamed for His death, and The Roman Empire murdered Jesus Christ naked on a Roman crucifixion cross.  Anyway, the warning is that Christians; as well as, many other Religions do not pay attention to the words Anti-Chirst Revived Roman Empire, and the Roman Empire is a Western Culture that organized a Religion in 325 A.D by Emperor Constantine, and the Religion was called Christianity, and that is why the portrait called Jesus Christ has the hair color auburn like that of Emperor Constantine being that Jesus Christ had the hair color of jet black like the secular Jews do, and Emperor Constantine's organized Religion called Christianity became a belief system that Jesus Christ approves of the Roman Empire's behavior, and that Jesus Christ plays favorites to the Christians; thus, comes the Anti-Christ part of what makes an Anti-Christ, and this is a practice seen even in the 21st Century; therefore, it sets up a danger in the 21st Century to see an Empire placing its military bases all over the World saying that Jesus Christ favors the Empire's behavior, and that Jesus Christ favors Christians doing it in the name of peace, and it is this that becomes the Anti-Christ Revived Roman Empire with a personality of arrogance, and with words of lies as a peace keeper it leads the World into an Armageddon which would be called in modern times a Global Nuclear War, and the Anti-Christ Revived Roman Empire that came back alive from a fatal head wound will be identified as a little horn because its time on Earth will be short; thus, little horn like an animal that is growing a big horn but dies before it can grow big; thus, little horn; therefore, since the first Roman Empire lasted approximately 1500 years, the Anti-Christ Revived Roman Empire of a personality of arrogance that is the little horn will not even come close to a 1500 years reign because Armageddon will greatly destroy the entire World which the Anti-Christ Revived Roman Empire begins in its conquest of the World, and the World will have no choice but to either be placed under the control of the Anti-Christ Revived Roman Empire, or fight back, and that is the energy that brings forth Armageddon.

2127675,2,B0002VKZRU,"FYI: this is a religious propaganda movie. Its a bit of a head twister, because the people in our own society that are trying to force everyone to follow their beliefs are the religious people, but once you realize they just flipped the roles around, its pretty clear whats going on. Simplistic, with surprisingly weak direction. I am sure the actors gave it their brainwashed best.

This narrative seeps into the minds of weak-willed people with little education so easily because it has kernels of reality thrown in. In this movie, for example, the idea that some corporate/government organization would enforce martial law is not terribly far-fetched. Trump himself has called for it, and if you go to Fox News, or Brietbart, or the Daily Caller and look at the comments, you'll see that the right-wing christian conservatives are calling for civil war and the murder of all liberals and democrats. Similarly, the KKK wants to seize the moment they have with a sympathetic president and congress to disenfranchise people of color and women; ISIS, Al Quaeda, Boko Haram, the Neo-Nazi movement, the government of Israel, all deeply right-wing, and rooted in one dark and twisted religious tradition or another, are all trying to impose their will on the world through violent means.  But the trick of this movie, and so many other religious propaganda movies, is to play up this idea of a world-dominating violence as if it is perpetrated ON religious people, instead of BY religious people.

The trick works because of the fundamental basis of all religions: religious people, and conservative religious people in particular, want to be victims. They want to feel like they are the persecuted ones. It is a thread that winds through all of the major religious texts. The one unifying principle in all of the major religions: that the oppressed are the blessed. So if you tell someone that they are being oppressed, they will instantly convert that to a belief that they are therefore blessed, righteous, and on the side of goodness and kittens. its particularly successful with conservative whites in the USA and Europe, because these are people who just one or two generations ago were in the position of being able to oppress and lord it over people of color with impunity, and 3 or 4 generations ago they could even own, rape, torture and murder people of color at will. They reaped the rewards of other people's labor and passed it on to their children. They maintained control of the power structures and created laws that kept it that way. But the last 2 generations of people of color have benefited from Affirmative Action, the Civil Rights Movement, and the globalization of information.

Affirmative action has created a cohort of people of color who grew up with parents who had an education and good jobs, not as exceptions to the rule, but on a wide-spread basis. That has changed the attitude and expectations of people of color dramatically. The Civil rights movement produced thousands of speakers and books clearly articulating the factual history of oppression and racism in the USA and elsewhere, allowing children to grow up in a world where the facts are easily accessible, and those educated parents can explain those facts to their children. The globalization of information has allowed this new-found abundance of factual history to reach all over the world.

As a result, white people, like me, simply don't have as much privilege as our parents had. Now, for me, and for most progressives, its not that big of a deal. I grew up dirt poor and had to work for everything I have. many progressives who didn't grow up poor still understood from a young age that the wealth their parents had was at least partly due to the unbalanced system of race-based privileges, and so they know its not going to last.  But for conservatives, especially religious conservatives, they grew up expecting the abundance and privilege of their parents, and at the same time, they are primed to assume the mantel of the oppressed - paradoxically.

That is what this movie seeks to exploit. Just remember that the only people trying to use violence to force everyoe to do things tyheir way are the religious right-wing jerks that gave us Trump, ISIS, Nazis, the KKK, Al Quaeda and the rest. There are no violent left-wing groups out there trying to subjugate anyone, or trying to force everyone to follow their religion. Just because Hitler's Nazis called themselves ""socialists"", don't be fooled. I can call myself cabbage, but you cant make sauerkraut out of me. The Nazis then and now are right-wing religious fundamentalists.

2127679,5,B0002VKZRU,"Only someone who is Christian would know what Rumors of War is. It refers to a biblical prophecy of the end times. It is strange that people would see everything that has gone on in the world since Sept. 11, the massive amount of natural disasters and the terrorism and not think something is going on. Yes, Christians are a persecuted minority in many places around the world and will increasingly become one according to Biblical prophecy, just look at the reviews. One reviewer called it ""Christian propaganda"". Another called it a ""right-wing conspiracy"". Yet, they are actually living Biblical prophecy and most people don't even know it. The amount of one star reviews just shows it.

It is a bit strange, since the movie is based on a 2,000 year old prediction. The movie does a great job of depicting what it would be like to live out this prophecy. It is a WARNING. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I had to pick up my Bible and read it, because this is almost to a T how it will be. This prophecy predicts that people will not be able to buy or sell without receiving a mark in their hands or forehead. The IOT (Internet of Things) will change a lot for humans in the next decade. You will be able to open your car, home and office with just an implanted microchip under your skin. You will also be able to pay for things with the same microchip. No more keys, no more wallets, no more stolen identities, etc. Seems ideal, but Bible prophecy warns believers away from such a reality because of the inherent dangers of abuse in such a system. This movie does a great job of displaying what the future will hold for many. You can clearly see this unfolding when you shop today, everyone is talking about the chip in the card. Well that chip will soon be in your ARM or forehead!!!!!

Not only that we are moving into a world where more and more people are calling for transhumanism, such as Elon Musk and others. Man will be merging with machine very soon. Lets hope that it all works out, but I think we know what will happen. The Bible says that there will come a time when people will wish for death and not find it or in other words be immortal. We are living in a new and scary age. It is best to be prepared for what is coming.

Two things the movie gets wrong:
1. This new system won't be anti-religion. The prophecy predicts that there will be a religion. There will be ONE religion for everyone. No freedom.
2. If you get the mark, you will not be able to get into Heaven if you ever get it. I believe it will be able to alter genes and utterly transform he carrier.",1511913600,5,2596,4.283095723014257

2127777,4,B0002VKZRU,"Faith-based movies come in two forms: those that are overly preachy about the End of Days and those that place Apocalyptic imagery in the background.  In RUMORS OF WAR, director Paul Tomborello presents a stark vision of the future that falls in the second category. There are two plot lines that criss-cross every few scenes. In the first, there is a present day America that has fallen prey to an insidious billionaire Zurn (Eric Roberts) who has usurped the constitution and relies upon a police force called the Alliance to keep everyone in line. To accomplish this, he as the supreme ruler (no mention is made how he has done this or what has happened to the three branches of government) who mandates that a computer chip be implanted in the right hand of all Americans. This chip ensures that the Alliance knows your whereabouts at all times. A young woman rebels against Zurn and writes a diary that endures over the years even after some vaguely defined war has shattered society. In the second, an Alliance member Shaw (Ben Davies) reads this forbidden book and gradually accepts the Truth, that all he has ever heard or has been taught is a lie. Shaw joins the resistance and there is hope for the future.

Much of the action takes place in the context of biblical prophesy and Old and New Testament imagery. The implanted chip is the mark of the devil.  The war is the one predicted in the Book of Revelation. The Prince of Peace will be born as the Redeemer. Now all of this is not as stifling as it sounds.  The plot, acting, dialogue, and directing are sufficiently creative to maintain viewer interest.  Much of the plot is borrowed from the book burning of FAHRENHEIT 451 and the soul searching of a police agent from EQUILIBRIUM. The rumors of the title are themselves allusions to biblical prophecies of future wars. The movie's theme seems to be that the United States could be transformed into a dictatorship that is wanted by Americans.  This is a most disturbing thought.  The carnage of our lives did not arise from the megalomania of one man but from the loss of faith that enabled this one man to reduce America to totalitarianism.",1430006400,,2157,4.660526315789474

2127779,4,B0002VKZRU,"I must admit that one of my guilty pleasures is to watch faith based end time films and this picture certainly fit the bill.  While the story isn't based on any one particular end time prophecy or scripture, there are familiar themes that most audiences of this genre will recognize.  Those themes include GPS enabled tracking chips being implanted into people, a charismatic leader who begins to convince people to blindly follow him, and a domestic military force that begins to clamp down and hunt for Christians.  The plot jumps back and forth from the future to the present and connects the storyline through the use of two protagonists.  The future protagonist is connected to our current protagonist by the leaving behind of a journal.  Essentially, this journal becomes a guide for our future protagonist and as he reads the journal we are taken back to the story of our current protagonist.
I like to commend the director of photography for this film because this film while clearly not on a big Hollywood budget, the shots of this film were nicely done.  The talent of the production and design team also clearly shine through on this film.  Many of the future dystopian scenes looked rather realistic, the suits of the future domestic army don't look cheap, and many of the camera shots added genuine suspense to the film.  I know that in many Christian films, while the story may be well, production and design sometimes come across as amateurish but not true in this film.  I do think the film could have used a tighter script and some better acting but overall if you are looking for a suspenseful, thought provoking film and possibly a glimpse into the future you will definitely want to watch this film!",1429833600,3,1719,4.760942760942761

While I feel that the acting and story line of this film was lacking some finer qualities, the story is much like, and just as pertinent as the following stories:
1984
Fahrenheit 451
Six - The Mark Unleashed

What is happening in our world today (especially in our technologically advanced society) is that more and more people are willing to accept the levels of monitoring that enable the control of mass populations. While it may be that no institution nor individual will ever want to assume this sort of control, the fact that we have technologically enabled such a prospect should be troubling to anyone with a will to have free choices. Couple this with our tendency to fear that which we cannot control, it is a recipe for disaster in the hands of institutions or individuals that seek to use those fears to assume more control of society at large.",1420848000,5,1107,4.706185567010309

This movie is not even close to the Left Behind movie, but I did like the message, and their thought of how the times would be after the rapture.

2127822,2,B0002VKZRU,"The plot concept is good, but so poorly executed.  Beyond the lack of character depth, and clumsy scripts, the constant back and forth between the past and ""present"" leave one confused.  There is no reasonable explanation as to why events progressed as they do, nor situations where one can empathize with the characters.  With a well developed plot and character depth this could have been a really good movie.  As it is, it is barely mediocre.",1419811200,5,445,4.815789473684211

2127834,4,B0002VKZRU,There are some quotable lines about our post 9/11 culture that tie into this end times apocalyptic Christian persecution movie.

2127838,5,B0002VKZRU,"If you're sick of the Left Behind movie series or cheesy Christian movies that are inaccurate Biblically or the annoying pre-tribulation vs post-trib rapture grand debate, then WATCH THIS MOVIE PLEASE! This is by FAR the MOST accurate for biblical prophecy and REALISTIC portrayal of the effects of war and future technology.

I like that this movie ignores and skips the whole pre-tribulation rapture perspective that is repeated OVER and OVER in most Christian movies unfortunately. The entire movie does refer to prophecy scriptures that become evident and fulfilled as the movie unfolds. The direction of the plot was clever and had an intelligent sequence twist. Very well done! I won't spoil it. The main lead actors were convincing. I liked Ben Davies, Jennifer Cooper, Michael Ulmer, Lee Garrett and a few others. Unfortunately Eric Roberts is NOT a believable antichrist villain in this movie to be honest.

This movie shows very realistic situations. For example, the government can track people within minutes and in times of government resistance there will always be groups of ""rebels"" with weapons when they see their rights are stripped and forced away by the government. Regardless of your spiritual background, you can imagine this would really happen when watching this movie. Please consider watching this movie even if you don't consider yourself a Christian or a believer of anything.",1417910400,,1405,5.24

2127840,1,B0002VKZRU,"I had no problem with this being a Christian movie. Christian mythology is as good a source as any for an interesting story. And even though it was clearly low budget it still had some decent performances and non-distracting (i.e., good) camera work and directing.

But I draw the line at 9/11 Truther propaganda, which is what this movie is ultimately about. People who believe that nonsense are pathetic and deserve a certain amount of pity. But they don't deserve your money.",1417305600,6,478,4.829268292682927

8033380,4,B0002VKZRU,"Good movie.  This movie is not about special effects.  This movie is about the Future.  What the Bible says in Revelation. Not everything in the movie is accurate regarding Revelation, but it sure gives you an idea of how it will be before Judgment Day. See the big picture:  Sin is our disease.  If you refuse to take the number and follow Christ Jesus = you will be His child and be spared from going to Hell.  The One World Government will not allow you to buy, sell, live in your home, give you food unless you voluntarily take the number.  Do you want to see your family starve?  No!  Food will be one of the greatest hooks to Christians and non-Christians is seeing your loved ones suffer.  All people will have to make a choice.  Would you voluntarily take the number?",1523664000,4,775,4.387323943661972

8033384,5,B0002VKZRU,"Beyond the Abrahamic bias, mediocre acting, and poor rendering of actual lust for violence and power, this movis has an EXCELLENT script. The plot, story line and character development are pidgeon-holed into an artificially, unnecessarily forced into a flat understanding of true judeo-christian mythos (think ""zurn enterprise logo"").
The historian kepr saying ""this is bigger than the chip"", yes it is. But it's also bigger than the western ""christian"" perspective. The axial prophets (jesus, socrates, buddha and Lao tzu) are more legends than myths. But they shared one thing in common.  Love each other, forgive each other, be kind to one another and the world will know peace. Salvation comes through: the grace of God,  oneness with the tao, wisdom, or complete detachment. These indicate their different metaphysical underpinnings, but the ethical prescription is the same.

If you can imagine more broadly then what modern Christian religious propaganda presents, then this isn't excellent movie to see. It is probably one of those that I could watch it again and again and again.",1521849600,,1088,5.313953488372093

Will definitely be encouraging others to watch this film. I hope it will itself encourage others to seek the truth in and from God's word, the Holy Bible. Look around you... The things that this movie, and ultimately the Word of God warn us about are already happening. The cornerstone of the, as George H. W. Bush called it, the New World Order, has already been fitted, and the foundations are being are being lain. The Prince of this world and his minions, the Powers that Be, are closer than ever to achieving their goal of a One World Government! Want to know history? Read the Holy Bible (KJV)!!! Want to understand the present? Read the Holy Bible (KJV)!!! Want to know the future? Read the Holy Bible (KJV)!!! I personally suggest starting with Revelations.",1518912000,,890,4.711538461538462
