(internet RPG hermits/junkies) can be. A nephew of mine had similar issues with the ""Worlds Of Warcraft"" and ""Diablo"" online internet RPGs.",1369353600,,317,5.115384615384615
8274008,5,B0019H6IW2,"22 year old Satou is a NEET, and a hikkikomori. He never leaves the house. He just sits around drinking beer, smoking, and watching TV. On top of all this he is also delusional. He convinces himself that a group called the NHK (Nihon Hikkikomori Kyoukai) is out to get him and turn the entire country into NEETs. One day a pretty high school girl named Misaki visits him and offers to give him counseling to cure his hikkikomori condition. The 2 become closer and begin to rely on each other. As their relationship strengthens Satou is able to venture out and do things on his own. Lot's of drama and comedy ensue.

This anime is completely different from anything I've ever seen. It dark and methodical vibe are complemented by the main characters hilarious paranoia and perverted imagination. The production is top notch. Animation and music are all very good. It also stars 2 of my favorite voice actors, Chris Patton and Luci Christian. Given Satou's perverted imagination, this anime isn't for young viewers. But if you're older and want to laugh a lot and want to see a interesting romantic comedy then this anime will probably make you very happy.",1354924800,,1154,4.712871287128713
8274009,4,B0019H6IW2,"Great series, and the episodes in this disc demonstrate a maturity of concept; Sato knows who and what he is, and plays it quite well.  His relationship with Misaki...progresses (?) as it generally does in Anim series.  His relationship with Yamazaki has improved quite a bit, and they do actually seem to be making progress on their game.  It seems funny, because Sato & friends go from place to place actually helping lonely, frustrated and lost people, which is an odd choice for a hikikomori.  Overall, a solid set of episodes that advances the storyline as well as entertains.

I read the original novel between seeing the 4th and 5th discs of this series, so I think that changed my viewpoint a little.  The differences between the anim and the novel really stand out a lot...Misaki looks much more like a positive thing than ever before, and Sato isn't nearly so hopeless as he was before.  Part of this is what was necessary to create an anim series from a novel/manga (dropping drug and lolita references for the most part), but there's also a substantial change of tone.  I'm really looking forward to the 6th disc.",1221264000,,1125,4.704081632653061
