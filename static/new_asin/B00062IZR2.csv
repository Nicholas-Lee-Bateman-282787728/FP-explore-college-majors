8037540,2,B00062IZR2,"Heavy-heavy-handed South Korean action/drama of the risky lives of firefighters struggling to keep up with a serial arsonist bent on  vengeance. The body count is pretty large by film's end. The flaws count, too -- with too many implausible heroics in flame-drenched buildings -- too many intense expressions -- overwrought poses -- and... pregnant... pauses.... The story's incoherence suggests that it took a backseat to the special effects. Not surprisingly, I suppose, the movie's supposed to be inspiring, too -- idolizing -- while not idealizing -- fireighters in general. But the movie should have made them smarter than shown here if they wanted to impress me. Still... if you like intense action with lots of fiery explosions and aimless running, I think I've found your film.",1276560000,,785,5.23015873015873
