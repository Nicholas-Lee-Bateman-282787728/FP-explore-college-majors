7985683,1,B00008N70U,"This DVD claims to be a 1922 Oscar Micheaux-directed film, but it is not and cannot be, since that title, which was made by Micheaux, did not survive. There is no existing copy of it in the world that Micheaux experts know about. When I ordered this DVD from Britain, it turned out to be a modern thriller. There is some confusion in the fact that the modern film has an African American actress, Shingzie Howard, who used to work for Micheaux.",1229385600,4,444,4.426829268292683
