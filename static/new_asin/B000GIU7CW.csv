5 Stars with sound off and Love's endowments on display.

3 Stars with sound off and Love's endowments not on display.

1 Star if sound is on, regardless of whether or not Love's endowments are on display.

Since I only watch it with the sound off and only pay attention when Love's endowments are on display, I gave it 5 stars.",1140912000,9,562,4.245283018867925

2613927,2,B000GIU7CW,"Romantic comedies aren't the greatest of movies to start off with, but this one is even worse than most. It's not clear why anybody ever produced it. It seems really sloppily done. The acting is horrible - even Jennifer Love Hewitt, who's not half bad. The filming screams ""made-for-TV"". The script and plot seem like they were phoned in by a teenage writer. There's no character or humor. The only part that made me laughed was the postcard from the African orphan. Still, I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 stars because we get to see Jennifer Love Hewitt in bikinis and she still looks good.",1335916800,,592,4.542056074766355
2613928,1,B000GIU7CW,This cracked me up so much.  I just watched five minutes of this movie and realized the lead character's voice is overdubbed by someone else.  It's not even Jennifer Love Hewitt's voice!  Hilarious and that should give you a hint of what watching this horrible movie is like.  They should play this movie to the prisoners in Guantanamo as a torture tactic- who needs waterboarding.,1331424000,,381,4.815384615384615

2613935,4,B000GIU7CW,"To begin with, if you really like Jennifer Love Hewitt, you should own this. It is somewhat different than a lot of her roles, as she plays sort of a manipulative sort, primarily interested in her own gain, even if at the expense of everyone else. Most of this is done in comedic style. There is a more serious underlying plot, which comes out later, and you see a more human side of her character, Katya (AKA Katie). There are a lot of funny bits in this, some of them perhaps a bit silly, but if you like comedy, this is a good one.",1296518400,5,534,4.144230769230769

a character they portray has few redeemable traits, but yet, you still root for them.
Katya is a social climber and will do most anything to get to an invitation only ball.
The best part of this film for me was JLH character's narration. She has to keep track of all her
expenses for her tax man. While doing so she pretty much ends up with
a daily diary of her life. Naughty, silly, charming fun. I rented it and plan to buy it for a pick me

2613940,3,B000GIU7CW,"If you like Jennifer Love Hewitt, this movie is just ok.  The best thing about it is her clothing/fashion and hair/makeup...but the movie in and of itself was not that great.  If you are a fan you will enjoy her many different looks in the film but there's not much else to it than that.",1222300800,2,287,4.2
2613941,5,B000GIU7CW,"This story is all about Jennifer, and indeed she is lovely despite her less likable character, she is very charming. She represents the ultimate beauty with plenty of all the desirable features. It is remarkable that she is the same actor who actually portrayed Audry Hepburn, and may I add very successfully too, considering the quite different physical appearance of the two actresses. In this case she is relying entirely on her beauty and charm.

It is especially satifying to watch Jennifer delivering her lines in a very natural and well contolled way perfectly coordinated with her charming body language.

It is of course easy to dismiss ""Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber"" as an insignificant movie, but if taken seriously, and if one is able to recognize the social patern and behaviour of today, the humour is great and Jennifer ever so beautiful.

This movie is made with exceptional attention to every detail in every department, including her many revealing outfits, and just to mention one scene from the movie, the one with Jennifer dancing in the fountain is extremely charming and beautiful.

Wholehartedly recommended.",1205971200,,1147,5.150537634408602
2613942,5,B000GIU7CW,"Katya is impossible to love or hate because she's impossible to take seriously. This is like a live action cartoon. Of course she's a villain, but she also doesn't know any better so she can't really be held accountable for her actions. I started reading the book this movie is based on a while back and discarded it after 20 pages finding the main character too contemptuous, but the movie seems to have a lot more humour, or at least a different sense of humour, like the necklace Katya wears with her own name displayed in diamonds which sums up the adorable ridiculousness of the character. The movie has aspects of romantic comedy and satire but neither is an overriding theme, which could be confusing for some people. It's value is more in it's bucking of filmmaking trends than in it's relevance to reality.",1186012800,6,815,4.666666666666667
2613943,3,B000GIU7CW,"I enjoyed the film, laughed a bit, and rooted for the love story, even if I could not relate to the excessive materialism of the main character.  If you prefer flair and wit to substance,  you might enjoy this film.  But I would advise most to watch it on TV.  It isn't quite worth the purchase price, and is best suited as a late night distraction.",1184630400,6,349,4.242424242424242
2613944,2,B000GIU7CW,"Jennifer Love Hewitt is the star of this not-so-funny made-for-TV romantic comedy ""Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber,"" which is based on the book of the same title by Adele Lang. In spite of the intriguing title, the film mainly relies on the clichd ideas about fame, money, love and office workers' life in San Francisco, and doesn't have anything new to tell. Worse, the film doesn't even know in what way we should look at this anti-heroine Katya Livingstone, 28, whose only purpose of life seems climbing up the social ladder.

Are we supposed to side (or laugh) with Katya, who never hesitates to use her co-workers and ex-boy friends to get what she wants? It is pretty demanding for anyone to identify with this very annoying social climber, who seems to need only two things in her life: invitation to the biggest party of the year and the hunky Mr. Right who is on the fourth floor of her company's building. But I don't see any social satire or anything funny about seeing Jennifer Love Hewitt's character donating some money for an African orphan, or giving useless financial advice to the boy. At least, the flat and tasteless direction of this film, where our silly heroine kills animals (twice) her boss keeps by doing supposedly `humorous' things, is not clearly up to the task of making social commetaries or providing us with really funny moments.

If we are supposed to hate and despise her, it would be a much easier task. I know obviously this is not the filmmakers' intention, and as the original book was written in the style of a diary (like Bridget Jones), Katya's unlikable traits should not be taken as face value. I know as much, and Ms. Hewitt almost managed to pull off the impossible, being nasty and lovable at the same time, but like Lindsay Lohan and her recent flop ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,"" equally irritating comedy drama, most viewers just stop being interested, and perhaps say, ""Why should we care?"" And I could find not many reasons.",1178496000,,1997,4.735632183908046
2613945,5,B000GIU7CW,Jennifer is AWESOME in this flick!! Don't listen to the fuddy duddys below. Not only is she extremely beautiful but the movie is a howl! It's fun to watch and great for eye candy!,1167004800,18,179,4.294117647058823
2613946,4,B000GIU7CW,"Light, entertaining comedy of errors. Definitely doesn't take itself too seriously.  Amusing reflection on modern values.

2613947,5,B000GIU7CW,"People are bashing this movie like it was made to win an Oscar.  It's a fun light comedy.  It's one of those feel good movies not to be taken seriously.  It was cute!  Jennifer Love Hewitt was soooo pretty in this movie and her clothes were cute too.  Joey Lawrence was also funny.  This movie also had a really good soundtrack.  It's aimed towards 20-30 something year olds.  I recorded it to DVD when it was on Oxygen and loved it so much decided to buy it.  Best Buy has it for $8.99.  Overall, this is a fun movie.",1162684800,22,518,4.141414141414141
2613948,2,B000GIU7CW,"The thing about this film that I eventually had to come to terms with is that it is not an examination of the disconnect between San Francisco socialites and Africa orphans. The fact that the orphans showed up at all lead me to believe that the filmmakers realize that they truly do exist, even if the characters do not. Rather this film is a case study in everything that is wrong with female entertainment in 2006. Beyond the fact that it is shallow to pine over characters pining over expensive merchandise, there is an overriding theory here and elsewhere that you too can be insufferable and still get the hunk so long as you are beautiful. Jennifer Love Hewitt shows up here working the blow up doll look to provide us with a repugnant role model. For the vast majority of the film we watch her obsess over the most vapid things imaginable: social gatherings, weight loss, white teeth, and career advancement. And the problem is that girls out there are blissfully sucking this garbage up not knowing that they are being indoctrinated into the chick lit mindset.

The message of the film is really the least of its worries. Its values are really no worse than what you would find on ""Entourage,"" a show I love. Of course ""Entourage"" has a few advantages, namely real characters, real emotions, real humor, and real scripts. Hewitt, who clearly has some sort of phobia of serious work, continues her downward spiral towards obscurity. Here she is picking up a paycheck for looking great and over acting. The director also appears to hate subtlety of any kind. The writer's idea of a running gag involves some chump who works everywhere Katya (Hewitt) goes. And after ""Empire Falls"" last year I never again want to hear the excuse that the film sucks because it is made for TV. Sorry slackers, the bar has been raised. There is a little empty pleasure to be gleaned and there are two legitimate chuckles, but that is all. To call this a cheese fest would be an insult to cheese.

Since there really are people like Katya in the world we can't say that there is no justifiable reason for this film. It's not Katya's fault that she was born minus brain cells and her type could be just as interesting as any other type. But thanks to everybody involved in this disaster there is just nothing interesting to be found. It does, however, land another blow to the conventional wisdom that says that ambition leads to wealth. We are asked to believe that this girl pulls in a six figure income even though we never see her working (even though we do see her at work). Then we are asked to believe that she got that far simply by being a very ambitious liar. That way we can believe that she ""earned"" her money as opposed to facing the truth which is that ambition leads to hurt feelings and rich parents lead to wealth. As long as we believe that we can ignore the stated message of this film (don't be a sociopath), and instead focus on the real one: Be rich, be beautiful, be a socialite. In other words, believe that Paris Hilton has ambition. **",1159660800,7,3046,4.536363636363636
2613949,4,B000GIU7CW,"Jennifer Love Hewitt will probably never look hotter than she is in this movie. Wow!! Her character katya is an ad exec for a major advertising firm. She basically exhibits behavior reflective of a sociopath through the movie. It's fun to watch her demean people and step on or walk over people to get to the top. The movie centers around katya trying to get an invitation to a big party at the same time trying to find the man of her dreams.

At times, the movie has some weak spots, but the end really pulls everything in nicely. Several running gags throughout the movie, with the bartender, the gatekeeper, and the security guards make the movie fun to watch a few times. Katya's gay friend, played by Joey Lawrence, is funny too.

If you ever get in the mood for some light comedy and a good story, this would be a great DVD to pick up.",1146182400,5,841,4.350318471337579
2613950,2,B000GIU7CW,"`Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber' is an '05 made-for-television feature promoted as a ""social satire"" (an attempt at relvance I guess). Unfortunately it's nothing more than an excuse to film Jennifer Love Hewitt in as many revealing outfits as possible within a limited amount of time.

Plot: Katya Livingston (Jennifer) is a beautiful but obnoxious, self-centered ad executive who lies, cheats and sleeps her way up the social ladder. Aided by her flamboyant best friend Ferguson (Joey Lawrence) she worms her way through the film reeking havoc wherever she goes.

Jennifer is unquestionably a very attractive young lady and I'll be the first to admit that just knowing she's in a film is enough to peek my interest, however even the lovely Jennifer cannot save this one. This movie is shallow, silly and predictable. It receives -2 Stars- instead of -1- simply because she's sooo easy on the eyes.",1145404800,3,911,5.066666666666666
2613951,4,B000GIU7CW,"I suppose that's why I enjoyed it.  The type of personalities most likely to appreciate the off-step and somewhat dry humor of this movie are the types who would also enjoy Amelie, Jimmy Hollywood, Home for the Holidays (the one co-starring Robert Downey Jr.) and perhaps an older film you might not remember: From the Hip.

What you don't get is Caddyshack or Vacation's classic humor or the goofy over-the-top Rocket Man and Happy Gilmore deep belly laughs.  Pretty much all this offers is a great way to spend about two hours when you have nothing better to do and something a little weird fits the bill.

Jennifer Love Hewitt delivers an unrealistic yet convincing portrayal of a high class advertising wanna-be while frequently prancing around as eye candy.  Her friends are almost in the same boat but have a slightly better idea of where they fit into society - as a bunch of misfits who desperately cling to each other in secluded little eccentric yuppie bars, somewhat like upper class geeks with a Liberaci complex.

Jennifer's character, Katya, manages to dodge responsiblity, evade her co-workers, charge company funds to selfish pleasures, and attempt to fool herself into believing she is a generous humanitarian for supporting an impoverished child in Africa (while poisoning his young little mind with capitalist ideas ;-P) as she plots a deceptive path to commercial stardom.  Well...everything eventually catches up to her and when the walls of her imaginary palace come crashing down she discovers that her scemes have miraculously paid off, though not quite the way she had envisioned.

So...if you don't like watered-down, almost tacky stories of dreamers who succeed, as in 1980's Xanadu, then I don't recommend Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber to you.  As with many of the films, books and CD's I have critiqued on Amazon (Memoirs of a Geisha, Radio Days, Xanadu, Brighton Beach Memoirs, Spring Moon, etc.) this is definitely a love it or leave it production.  There is no middle ground.

By the way...I didn't rate it 5 stars because despite being thoroughly enjoyable, it is a little slow paced with an arguably weak plot.",1143590400,10,2158,5.0

But even she couldn't save this film from sub par status.  Jennifer plays a very self centered employee of an advertising agency (she lies about her credentials to get the job), whose number one goal is to become a popular socialite.  She falls in love with an attorney who likes her but is turned off by her stuck up persona.  She eventually dumps the fake attitude to win the guy over.  Jennifer is too sweet of an actress to do a credible job playing a ""bad girl.""  But even despite that fact, the film is slow moving, very predictable, and just plain boring.

8132758,5,B000GIU7CW,"Should have been titled ""Great Cleavage - The Movie"". JLH looks incredible in every last one of her scenes!  Movie is definitely funny as well. May have been a cable tv movie. However it's movie theater quality. JLH's second best film after Heartbreakers. It's a very close second.",1481328000,,281,4.854166666666667
8132759,5,B000GIU7CW,"I love this movie! I am a huge Jennifer love Hewitt fan. I have loved this movie since I saw it on oxygen when I was in high school. Katya is like a girl in high school. She wants to be someone, even if it means spending a lot of money or telling a lot of lies. When she infuriates a woman throwing the party to end all parties, she'll look for any way to get in. Katya is not instantly likeable. She lies and uses people to get ahead in life. She's cruel and acts like she's a good person when she's being a downright awful one. But everyone has felt that urge to fit in. and it is so funny to watch her try and mostly fail. I think it has a very nice ending and is a very fun movie!",1474329600,,684,3.7902097902097904
