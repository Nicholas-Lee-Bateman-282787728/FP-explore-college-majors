8320419,1,B001M45OBS,"Porn Shoot Massacre (Corbin Timbrook, 2009)

I am sure that, somehow, it is possible for Porn Shoot Massacre to have been a worse film than it is. I cannot think of one off the top of my head, but I am certain it exists. Don't believe me? I'd tell you to hit play and see for yourself, but...no.

Plot: Malfini (Bedazzled's Robert E. Ambrose), a mysterious director with very wealthy backers,  is recruiting porn stars for a new movie. Seven of the biggest names in the business decide to give it a go. As each gets there, they discover that the set is nothing like they have ever worked on, and Malfini himself seems a little... off. Given the title of the film, I'm sure it wouldn't be a spoiler to tell you that porn is not what Malfini is intending to film...

Here's a bit of suspension of disbelief for you: Malfini's mustache and beard are just as fake as Son of Ghoul's, and yet no one seems to notice until halfway through the movie. If no one had noticed at all, I could have put it down to a special effects budget of zero. If everyone had noticed, they could have made it into a (bad, but still) running gag. Instead, they threw in the one girl who kind of notices something's up, but doesn't quite connect the dots.  There's an obvious conclusion to be drawn that, taken to its logical conclusion, has some pretty dark things to say about disposable characters in slasher films and what the scriptwriters who utilize them think about said characters. Or it could have just been brainless stereotyping, your call. In either case, even had the movie had a shred of sympathy by that point, it would have lost it there. I won't go so far as to call it blatantly offensive, but it's braindead, manages neither chills nor laughs, and is likely to have you rooting for the killer right quick.

8320420,5,B001M45OBS,It was an interesting film.  It was a typical slasher movie with beautiful ladies.  it was funny in some parts. Makes you wonder what goes on in studios. Overall it was a low budget cult classic.,1386288000,,195,4.388888888888889

8320423,2,B001M45OBS,"Another low budget movie that does not deliver. Not a lot of nudity, with a title like this there should have been a lot more. The blood and gore is dim store stuff , the acting is as good as the script [that not saying a lot] and the sound quality is just bad . I think the cover does justice to the movie i.e. dull. Buy Gutterball instead or Amateur Porn Star Killer or A Fred Olen Ray [even his no budget movies are more fun than this].P.S. this is a comedy/horror which just adds to the lameness.",1237766400,13,500,4.0606060606060606
