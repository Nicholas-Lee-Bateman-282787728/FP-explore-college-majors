974725,3,6305164215,"Got the DVD ... a few days ago, and must say I'm amazed at the poor sound quality towards the end of the wedding scene.  The Ave Maria solo is fine, quite moving in fact; but the organ music which follows and accompanies the end of the scene ""wows"" something horrible.  Was this on the original sound track and I missed it? or is it some sort of joke by the transfer department.  The well placed mafia could surely have afforded a decent church organ, or have I missed the point and this is yet another piece of black comedy? As a film I enjoyed it first time round, and the apart from the above the transfer is OK - a bit lacking in extras, but at least it's free from cheesy adverts.",993859200,,685,4.135338345864661
974726,5,6305164215,"In a recent poll that Premire magazine conducted, it was picked unanimously by filmmakers worldwide, if they were allowed to revote many filmmakers would have voted Prizzi's Honor for best picture at the academy awards. Out of Africa ended up winning and no one even talks about it anymore, at IMDB.com Out of Africa rates the lowest out of the five nominies.

If you like this movie don't let it slip through your memory, let others know about so hopefully one day it will be as popular as The Graduate. The film is amazing, John Hustons direction....FANTASTIC. Jack Nicholson gives a great performance. The film is a great black comedy that you can watch over and over again. The dvd is a emmbarresment to the film, ugly transfer, no special features, and the aspect ratio is wrong. The film was shot with a 2:35:1 aspect ratio and the dvd is presented in a 1:85:1 aspect ratio.

Anchor Bay did the same thing with the Sleuth dvd,though it was only minor, the Sleuth dvd presented the film in a 1:66:1 aspect ratio. With a new release of Sleuth they're finally presenting it in its correct 1:85:1 aspect ratio.

To all of us who love Prizzi's Honor, please write to Anchor Bay and tell them to put special features and present the film in its right aspect ratio. The dvd wouldn't be so bad if it was presented in 2:35 and had a amazing transfer. Great film Not to be missed!",992044800,14,1376,4.518072289156627

However, in judging a film, I believe it is unimportant whether the film expresses or remains true to its particular genre. I also believe  that insisting on the movie having ""a point"" is indicative of  limited, two-dimensional thought. (What is the point of a Monet?) Instead,  I ask how well it held my attention and interest, and how much it made me  reflect afterwards. This movie accomplished all of these. While it is not a  great film - it did not make me see life in a new way - it is a good film.  The ending is weak, and the photography is only average. However, the  acting is superb, and the script tickles the imagination. The DVD, on the  other hand, is only acceptable because of the lack of features.

His struggle to have something good in his life while remaining loyal to an organization that is anything but amounts to a very fun caper, not to mention a very strongly acted one. Aside from Nicholson and Turner, I especially enjoyed William Hickey's aging mob boss and Angelica Huston's performance as Charley's jealous and manipulative ex-lover. Anyone interested in organized crime is bound to enjoy this movie as is anyone interested in philosophy for the way Charley's unfortunate situation could lead to rousing fate vs. chance debates. It is also bound to appeal to classic noir fans.

974853,5,6305164215,"Prizzis Honor stars Jack Nicholson as Charley Partanna, the adoptive son of Don Corrado (William Hickey), head of Brooklyns Prizzi family. At a family wedding, Charley sees a beautiful woman, Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner), who intrigues him and whom he eventually marries. But her beauty obscures the fact that she is a thief and a killer for hire. His feelings for Irene exacerbate the animosity between Charley and ex-girlfriend Maerose Prizzi (Anjelica Huston), who is the Dons granddaughter. Maerose begins a scheme to get both of them eliminated, relying on her cleverness, vindictiveness and ability to adhere to the familys strict code of honor.

Nicholson, Hickey and Huston all received Oscar nominations under John Hustons direction. The characters are all deeply flawed, and the moral dilemma that writer Richard Condon sets up (based on his own novel) creates fascinating, and often darkly comic, situations. A lot happens in two hours  a kidnapping, a gang war, police corruption, and a power struggle within the Prizzi crime organization. Charley and Irene even get caught up in a complex extortion scheme.

Chemistry between Nicholson and Turner sizzles, but Anjelica Hustons tough broad survivor is the films best performance. Director Huston combines crime drama, black humor, and satire, creating suspense and tension along the way. Prizzis Honor doesnt have the Shakespearean resonance of The Godfather, but it is nonetheless an exceptional motion picture.

975315,5,6305164215,"Prizzi's honor (John Huston, 1983, 130`)

Prizzi's Honor is a 1985 American black comedy film directed by John Huston. It stars Jack Nicholson, Kathleen Turner, Robert Loggia and Anjelica Huston (who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Maerose Prizzi).

The film was adapted by Richard Condon and Janet Roach from Condon's novel of the same name (1982). Its score, composed by Alex North, adapts music of Puccini and Rossini. It is John Huston's 1984 third last and also his last American film - to be followed by Under the volcano (1984, Mexico) and The dead (1987, Ireland).

The film tells the story of a mob hit man (Nicholson) and hit woman (Turner) who fall in love, even though they have been hired to kill each other.

Critic Pauline Kael wrote: ""This John Huston picture has a ripe and daring comic tone. It revels voluptuously in the murderous finagling of the members of a Brooklyn Mafia family, and rejoices in their scams. It's like The Godfather acted out by The Munsters. Jack Nicholson's average-guyness as Charley, the clan's enforcer, is the film's touchstone: this is a baroque comedy about people who behave in ordinary ways in grotesque circumstances, and it has the juice of everyday family craziness in it.""

Perhaps to be added is that in what must be one of the longest shots, to an Ave Maria impeccably sung during a church wedding, we see Nicholson looking around and discovering Turner; later, in the reception hall, a similar search, ending in a tarantella style Southern Italian dance by Nicholson and his newly found partner. Nicholson, of whom one tends to think to have seen him in any possible role, reaches new heights as mobster supremo designate.

975316,4,6305164215,"PRIZZI'S HONOR has been on my list of acclaimed films that I have missed through the years. I knew nothing about the plot but I knew this film brought much deserved attention to Anjelica Huston that led to active career as an actress.

The cast is fantastic with Jack Nicholson as a mob hitman who totally by accident falls in love with his female counterpart in crime. Can two hitmen or hitman and hitwoman find love and happiness together? Here is a black comedy that does not take itself too seriously. There is plenty of violence but somehow the edge is on the farce of to killers finding each other. No surprise as to who they are each hired to kill.
Kathleen Turner stars at the female killer and she has never been lovelier or livelier. Anjelica Huston shines as the mobster's daughter who has  shamed her family and has been banisged. She has been wronged by everyone and is out for revenged

Another stand-out is William Hickey as the ""Godfather"" of the Prizzi clan of thugs. He looks and acts creepy and is obviously made up to look much older than his actual age. His sinister voice is hard to understand and only adds to the creepiness factor.

PRIZZI'S HONOR has a slow start and set-up as the film starts with a wedding scene that drags on and on. It's low to get the action started so be patient. It takes time for the comical farce to fall into place but it is worth the wait.",1339632000,4,1392,4.404669260700389

975434,5,6305164215,"For all it's comic tone, this is one of the hardest hitting gangster flicks I think I've seen in a long time - if ever.  It's pure film noir though you wouldn't think so until the ending - which is just about as hard as nails.  I'm not saying it's the 'best' gangster film I've ever seen, but sheesh, it packs a punch you'll be reeling from by the time the credits roll.  And sure we expect brutality as the foundation for any decent mob flick, but this one kind of reached into new territory for me.  The movie played out the way it had to and it's kind of tough to stomach on an emotional level.  But from the point of view of the story, and it's characters, the movie does not falter and stays true to its logic.

The performances are great all around. The old don in this movie is incredible - creepy and decrepitly sinister, a very unique 'don' character in the catalogue of mafia movies.  Charlie's father was great, and of course Nicholson does a GREAT job as Italian gangster Charley Pattana - his acting is distinct and fitting (i.e. he goes beyond himself as himself).  Kathleen Turner as his love interest then wife, Irene, was likeable as well.  I wasn't always sure I bought the chemistry 100%, but the movie is bigger than just their relationship - which certainly wasn't bad by any accounts - just not 'sizzling', for all the love that was professed.  Then again this is love between a hit-woman and a gangster, so I don't know what exactly one could hope for.  There was a certain touchingness in the trust that develops between them, and of course there's a comic tone that lightens the whole thing in the first place - but never to the detriment of the story.  The light tone in fact only enhances its noirish resolution in the end driving the hammer down upon the nail of irony - or destiny, as this movie would have it.

Irene: ""I've been doing 3 or 4 hits a year for the last few years, most of them full pay.""

Charlie: ""That many?""

Irene: ""Well, it's not that many when you consider the size of the population.""",1286755200,5,2035,4.360742705570292
975435,5,6305164215,"Somehow I missed this 1985 film when it was in the theaters.  That's why I was delighted that it was available on cable.  From the very beginning I was instantly engaged in a compelling story that was pure comic genius as well as having a touch of tragedy.  Jack Nicholson is cast as a hit man in a Mafia family.  He's amazing in this role and even gets the New York Brooklyn accent right.  The film opens at a wedding with all its pomp and glory.  That's where Nicholson spots the blonde and beautiful Kathleen Turner.  He asks her to dance and is immediately smitten.  Suddenly she is called away.  Who is she?  Why was she at the wedding.  All this is a mystery at first.

Eventually Nicholson romances the evasive Turner.  He's in love.  He wants to marry her.  And then he finds out that she, too, is an assassin and they both work for the same bosses.  The plot twists and turns and Angelica Houston, who later won an Academy Award for her role in this film, is cast as the black sheep of the family with her own grudge to bear against Nicholson, is looking for her own kind of revenge.  How this all plays out is the stuff of dark comedy which kept my eyes glued to the screen and had me laughing out loud at times.

The film is 130 minutes long but the plot moved with the speed of light;  there wasn't one boring minute.  This is pure and slightly offbeat entertainment.  Try not to miss it.",1283644800,3,1400,4.247148288973384
975436,4,6305164215,"After watching ""Chinatown"" I was curious to see ""Prizzi's Honor,"" because of the whole Nicholson/Anjelica Huston on again/off again romance that began around the time that Chinatown was shot. There was so much drama behind the set of Chinatown that it was a wonder that the film was made at all, let alone that it was a film noir masterpiece, so my review of Chinatown didn't delve into the father/daughter aspect, but as you may know, John Huston played Noah Cross and Nicholson, as detective Jake Gittes, is involved with Cross' daughter (played by Faye Dunaway). He confronts Noah, who has got to be the worst father since, well, Noah, and I couldn't help wondering how Nicholson's offscreen romance with Huston's daughter affected their respective performances.

So, in Prizzi's Honor, Nicholson and John Huston are working together again, but this time Huston is the director, and Anjelica Huston is onscreen this time, as the daughter of a powerful mob family. Anjelica really steals the whole film, and wins an Oscar for her performance. It helps, I guess, if your father is the director, if you are going to steal a film from the ostensible leads, but though John Huston may have been an accessory to the crime, it was really Anjelica's performance that got her that Oscar. She was also great in ""The Grifters,"" if you require further proof of her talent. In Prizzi's Honor, though, she is shown mercilessly manipulating her father, and I'm wondering if John Huston was going, like, so that's how she does it?

Anjelica was the best thing about Prizzi's Honor, and as for Director John Huston, Jack Nicholson, and Kathleen Turner, it was not their best work. The main problem I had with Prizzi's Honor was that it was written as a set up for the premise: what if a hit man and a hit woman fell in love, but then each one was hired to kill the other? It was mostly put together well enough so that you are not aware of the carpenters hammering and sawing behind the scenery, but there were a few gaping holes in the plot.

Kathleen Turner was adequate as the femme fatale, but didn't generate the body heat she did in ""Who Killed Roger Rabbit?"" let alone ""Body Heat."" Nicholson was really off his game. What was that accent supposed to be? Brooklynese? He reminded me of Archie Bunker, without that man's wit and wisdom. He seemed dazed and confused, and yet he was going to be put in charge of the Prizzi family business? The ""love at first sight"" he was supposed to feel for Turner's hit woman wasn't convincing. When he struggled to articulate his ""feelings"" it was really cringe worthy.

I liked William Hickey, the guy who played Don Corrado Prizzi. He had a really gravely voice that could have become grating real fast--but I enjoyed his performance. Perhaps it was meant to be a parody of Marlon Brando as the Godfather. At least he didn't stuff an orange in his mouth.

Bottom line is Prizzi's Honor is mainly Anjelica's honor, but for the rest, not their best work. Still, they are all so talented, even when it is not their best work, it is still better than most. John Huston and Jack Nicholson, and many others, were nominated for Oscars for this, but Anjelica is the only one who won one. Though the studio didn't expect it to do well, positive word-of-mouth built up slowly but surely.

975520,4,6305164215,"A mafia movie starring Jack Nicholson (one of the worlds greatest actors; ever) and co-staring greats like Anjelica Huston and Robert Loggia, directed by the well respected John Huston; I mean, this is a dream come true right?

Close.

`Prizzi's Honor' is a black comedy revolving around a mafia family and their dysfunctional lives, and for the most part this movie nails it.  There are a few misfires, sadly, but I would be lying if I said that this wasn't very satisfying despite those shortcomings.

Charley Partanna is the number one hitman for the Prizzi family.  He was at one time engaged to Dominic Prizzi's daughter Maerose.  After humiliating her family and Charley (by shacking up with another guy) Maerose is ostracized by the family, allowed only to interact with them on special occasions.  The film opens on such an occasion, the wedding of Maerose's sister.  At this wedding Charley happens to meet Irene, a beautiful blonde who strikes his fancy.  They dance, they part, they reunite, they fall in love and decide to marry.  Turns out that Irene is also a hit(wo)man and complications thus ensue as her identity is revealed.  Twists and turns and doublecrossments abound as the film spirals towards a very `Mr. and Mrs. Smith' type conclusion; all of which add layers to this well written and well acted film.

The script is a gem, caging wit alongside passion and espionage to create a smart and engaging film that is as thrilling as it is comical.  The gags are subtle, never over-the-top (this isn't `Mafia' people) and they elevate the film, giving it an edge that is welcome.

The performances make and break this film; and this is precisely what I mean about a few misfires.  First off, Jack Nicholson delivers seriously one of his finest performances of all time.  This one ranks up with `The Shining' and `About Schmidt' for me as one of the `other' layers of Jack.  For anyone who claims that Jack can only play `Jack' they need to watch this film.  He creates a perfect comedic caricature complete with a new voice, a new walk and a new smile.  He's completely transformed.  Kathleen Turner is one of those actresses I feel never got as big as she should have been.  She always seems to really entertain me, and while I felt that she took a backseat to Nicholson here (he really is all sorts of amazing) she really did her best to rise above.  Robert Loggia is another standout.  He is one of those actors who acts from his head to his toes, and he pulls it off brilliantly.  I remember a scene in particular when he walks out of an elevator and chats up a young lady.  He's out of focus and practically out of view yet our attention is driven to him because he is still very much in character.

And then we come to William Hickey and Anjelica Huston; the two Oscar nominees (Nicholson was also nominated, but deservedly so).  I really wanted to like these performances, but they were either extremely annoying or nothing special at all.  Hickey for instance was awful in my book.  I loathed seeing him on the screen.  I really wish that Loggia had received the Oscar nomination instead for his performance was much richer and far better executed.  Huston was not bad, but she did nothing special for me.  I really enjoyed her `there is no honor' speech, but I feel that her win was unnecessary (as was her nomination) and that she really only took home the Oscar because of her family ties.

Avery, Winfrey and Tilly were much more deserving.

In the end though, I must admit that despite its few shortcomings the film really delivers.  It's funny, it's smart and it's engaging from start to finish and Nicholson really delivers a knockout performance.  I guaranty that you'll enjoy this movie (that is unless you don't) and highly recommend it to any fan of the cast or the genre.  I love gangster movies, and this one has an edge.

975521,3,6305164215,"I remembered this being good, but those were rose-tinted lenses. The script is lame, all the ""mafia"" folks are anything but Sicilian (laughably so), Jack is definitely no Italian and not even very convincing in this role (he's just not a tough guy, deep down), and how did Angelica get an Oscar for this? She's barely ok, and her father's direction is some of the worst of his mostly splendid career.

This whole film just feels weak and flaccid. It might be meant to be a joke but it's almost never that funny, not very dramatic, and basically just flat. I wanted to like it but facts is facts. I've no idea why it seems so good to so many. Rose lenses as well? Have they seen GoodFellas, Casino, or the Godfather? THOSE are real mob flicks, black humor and all. THIS is some weird mishmash that just never gets off the ground. All the plot twists add up to little suspense. And some of the looping (voice dubbing) is simply horrible! It's like a bad 70s tv show at times.

There are some amusing moments and Jack is never all bad, but his chemistry with Turner is weak, and she seems very poor up against Jack's aura (even when he's weak he's a star, some guys just got it).

I love Jack and John Huston is one hell of a director when he's happening (though Polanski used Jack to far greater effect, and Huston too for that matter, in Chinatown), but save your time and watch the Godfather parts one and two again (or Chinatown, also long but more gracefully so).

975523,4,6305164215,"When the mafia becomes the argument of an action film and little more it is no longer funny, it is no longer strange, it is no longer fascinating. It is nothing but outlandish and terroristic. It takes all Jack Nicholson can give to make these characters in anyway palatable, and even so. In the Prizzi family all other considerations than the family is outlawed, except maybe for a couple of weeks and the woman concerned by this out-breeding passing passion has to submit and take the color of the wall on which she is being pinned. If she does not then she will be executed and cut off. There is no depth in that film, no subtleties or even subtlety. Get the message, bang it down on the table and then cram it down your brain. Business is business and in-breeding is the rule. I will always wonder why a hit-woman with a reputation of efficiency and effectiveness misses her husband when he intends to kill her though she manages to shoot one bullet first. Suspend your disbelief and incredulity. The cinema is the new church of the visual dominant animal man is. To see is to believe. But at times to believe is easier when you are blind, and probably deaf too. Apart from that it is interesting even if we do spend a little bit too much time in planes going east and planes going west, kind of an airlift between New York, or whatever may titillate you, and Los Angeles, or whatever it takes to please you.

He is given another assignment, kill his wife.  The question is who comes first, his ""family"" or his wife?

This is a brilliant black comedy.  John Huston proves that he not only can handle crime drama but crime comedy.  This was one of last films and was one of his best films.

Jack Nicholson gives one of his finest performances.  This is probably one of his most underrated performances.  There is no flashy scenes just a great character.

Kathleen Turner has never been better.  Again, this is not a flashy role, just well written.  This is her greatest performance.

But the find of the film is Angelica Huston.  Angelica made a film with her father before and had a terrible experience.  After that, she had minor roles in lesser films.  This would give her an Oscar and a new film career.

It's a civilized entertainment - perhaps a little too civilized at times, although William Hickey's deathly white vampiric Don gives a whole new meaning to the phrase Cookie Monster - elegantly made and plotted, which wasn't so rare in 1985 but these days is a positive novelty.

and he was great by directing this movie

awesome man

Jack play Charlie Partanna is cool

He reminded me of this one Italian friend of mine

good use of the times and clothes too in many shots

the movie was interesting

sad in some parts

but hooked me all the way thru

have it on dvd and am glad I saw it

go rent this one

The ending is what really interested me

It's a dark comedy so to speak if you want to put it that way

but there are laughs and touching moments in it",1092700800,,519,3.875

William Hickey, frail, onion skinned, gravel voiced is unforgettable as Don Corrado Prizzi (lovingly called Padrino <Godfather> by Jack's Charlie Partanna).

975616,5,6305164215,"This is a great movie. It has substance, it has style, it has humor, and it has some excellent acting (my favorites are W. Hickey in the role of the family don and A. Huston as the black sheep of the family). Nothing new about these facts, every review on this page will tell you similar things. I would like to point something else out - did anybody else notice just how extraordinary beautiful Kathleen Turner was in this movie? For example that scene where don talks to her in the garden and tells her she has to pay the other half of the money back to the family... I think, no - I am 100 percent sure, this is the most beautiful face I've ever seen in any movie.",1076284800,2,667,4.138461538461539
975617,5,6305164215,"Only after seeing this film can you be expected to believe that this is a charming comedy about two killers (PC: hit persons) who are deeply involved with mob families, fall madly in love, and then....

One is Charley Partanna (Jack Nicholson), a contract laborer for the Prizzi family headed by Don Corrado (William Hickey) on the East Coast; the other is Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner), based on the West Coast, who had already accepted an assignment from the Prizzis before meeting Partanna and then falling in love with him. The romance flourishes for a time. The complications that ensue are best revealed while viewing the film.

Previously, Partanna had ended his relationship with Maerose Prizzi (Angelica Huston), Don Corrado Prizzi 's beloved but volatile granddaughter. She is determined to regain the favor of the family's elders, especially its Don. Later, Huston received an Academy Award for best performance by an actress in a supporting role. She deserved it. Although apparently quite talented in his line of work, Charley often seems somewhat dimwitted, at least when contrasted with Irene who seems highly intelligent as well as physically attractive. Watching Nicholson play a smitten, almost schoolboyish Charlie is indeed a treat.

Director John Huston does a brilliant job of juxtaposing romantic comedy with mob-directed violence. Amidst all the laughter, people really do get killed. William Hickey certainly deserved his nomination  for an Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role, won in 1985 by Don Ameche for his work in Cocoon. Hickey and other members of the cast were blessed with having an immensely clever script by Richard Condon, based on his novel. Listen carefully to Hickey's reading of his lines while also paying close attention to his masterful use of body language. Don Corrado Prizzi is indeed a lovable but deadly senior citizen. Yes, this film is highly entertaining. Witty, at times zany. However, as directed by John Huston, it also has layers of subtle menace as it examines darker regions of human nature.",1058918400,37,2065,5.155223880597015
975618,3,6305164215,"'Prizzi's Honor' is a mediocre gangster/love story set, of coarse, in New York City.  Jack Nicholson plays a hitman who falls in love with a seemingly innocent woman.  Later he finds out the woman is part of a complicated hiest and has command of a large sum of money.  Directed by the legendary John Houston, this film seems odd and off balance at times, but never is bad.  Nicholson and Angelica Houston kept my interest even when the plot was confusing and not interesting.  The ending was not sad nor very tense.
