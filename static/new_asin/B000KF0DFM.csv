2689018,5,B000KF0DFM,"I loved the Lucky Louie series on HBO, staring comedian Loius C.K. Also among the cast is The Opie & Anthony show's own lil' Jimmy Norton. HBO are dummies for not renewing this show. Pick this up for a chuckle if it's your brand of humor.

When told about the cancellation of the series, head writer Steve C. from the Yellowstone times said, ""That's terrible, I'm sorry"".",1164153600,11,371,4.537313432835821
2689019,4,B000KF0DFM,"""Lucky Louie"" got a whole sackful of lousy reviews when it premiered on HBO, and most of them seemed to take issue with how crass the show's tone was.  Since I had just recently subscribed to HBO and was determined to watch ALL of their typically excellent original programming, I decided that I would watch the first episode, despite the bad reviews.

Half an hour later, I'd been laughing for nearly half an hour.  This is a FUNNY show.  Yes, there is a lot of profanity; yes, there are some uncomfortable bits involving how inadvertently racist the main character is.  But so what?  It's nothing compared to ""Deadwood,"" I assure you of that.

There's nothing here that's exactly groundbreaking or revolutionary; it's really a very normal sitcom in the vein of something you might have seen in the late '70s to mid-'80s.  The plots are typical of that genre.  But the characters talk like real people (or at least like real people I know; maybe you don't know people like this, but I certainly do), and they kind of act like real people, too.  At least, Louie and Kim do; the other characters fall more in the vein of the typical wacky sitcom character.  They're kind of like potty-mouthed Kramers.

Somehow, for me, what all this adds up to is a VERY loving portrayal of a marriage.  Louie is constantly doing something incredibly boneheaded to make his wife, Kim, slackjawed with astonishment.  The specifics may well be flights of fancy, but the reactions seem very genuine.  This, to me, FEELS like a real married couple.  They don't necessarily like each other very much, but they definitely love each other.  That may sound like a contradiction, but you may change your mind after watching these DVDs.

The actig is generally strong.  Louis C.K. is sort of in the same tradition as Jerry Seinfeld and Ray Romano in the sense that while you can't exactly make a claim for him being a great actor, you also can't imagine his show without him in it.  Pamela Adlon -- who also does Bobby's voice on ""King of the Hill"" -- is terrific as Kim; she's sharp, sexier than heck, and very funny in a put-upon sort of way.  The aforementioned wacky sitcom characters are played by Michael G. Hagerty, Jim Norton, Laura Kightlinger, and Rick Shapiro, and they are all very, very funny.

Also definitely worth mentioning are Jerry Minor and Kimberly Hawthorne, who play Louie and Kim's African American neighbors.  There is a very funny dynamic between these two couples, in which Louie tries VERY hard to make friends with Walter simply because he's never had a black friend before.  Naturally, Louie overcompensates and ends up being more of a racist by accident than many men manage on purpose.  Some of these scenes are just hysterical, mostly because of Minor's droll performance.  In some episodes, you can see that he is so put upon by his wife that he tries to put up with Louie, just so he'll have someone else to talk to.  This is all handled in a manner close to perfection.

To sum up, I think this was a pretty terrific show.  It's VERY funny, touching in an unexpected sort of way, and in its own fashion it's up to par with the rest of HBO's intimidatingly good output.  I'm confused as to why critics didn't find this to be the case, and I'm hopeful that the DVDs will help the show find the audience it deserves, even if it IS after the fact.",1163894400,86,3352,4.594276094276094
2689020,4,B000KF0DFM,"When I first heard of Lucky Louie before it aired on HBO, I became proud of HBO for finding a new idea for another comedy series. The only comedy series I had watched was Curb Your Enthusiasm. After I had watched the first episode, I thought that it was good and not good. Some parts were very funny and some were not funny. The previews for future episodes made me want to watch. As time went on, I had grown to like and maybe love the series. I loved it because it was just stupid and the adults had the brains of children. If there is anyone who will love this series, it would be someone who likes to share their nasty dreams about going down on a demon to a priest. I am buying this DVD because I actually have the brain of a child and I missed the final two episodes because I had to go to Florida. It is a shame that this series was cancelled.",1163289600,8,850,4.035502958579881

2689026,4,B000KF0DFM,"If you are a true Louis C. K. fan you owe it to yourself to get a copy of his first foray in to TV.  It isn't quite as, umm I was about to say polished as his new show but that isn't quite the right word.  It's, I dunno, slightly off.  You can tell something about the show isn't quite on the mark.  It maybe just a case of me mentally comparing it to the new show ""Louie"" which he has complete creative control over. It may just be the case that he didn't have complete creative control over this show or maybe he just wasn't ready to go that extra bit that he does in creating ""Louie.""

Okay, I got a comparison: are you a fan of ""Star Trek the Next Generation""?  Watch the first season of STtNG especially if you haven't seen it since it originally aired, and compare that to the later seasons of the show.  ""Lucky Louie"" feels like the first season of STtNG compaired to ""Louie"" and the later seasons of STtNG.  They just tuned it better and everything feels more natural.",1488412800,3,976,4.154255319148936
2689027,5,B000KF0DFM,"Brilliantly funny, raw and sometimes dark, Lucky Louie was -- and remains ahead of its time.

Structured like a typical sitcom, Lucky Louie explodes the audience's expectation with its frank discussions of sex and relationship issues, extremely high profanity quotient, and its, in some cases, seemingly unredeemable yet somehow affectionate characters.

Those familiar with CK's stand-up with recogise his trademark style and persona, but 11 years ago, his audience was not nearly as large, and the material must have been rather... bracing for the vast majority of HBO viewers.

Undoubtedly, this contributed to the show's single-season run, but if had become a hit, Mr. CK's would not have followed the trajectory that brought us his other, more succinctly eponymous series, Louie, and any number of other projects that built on this experience.

Lucky Louie is a must-read for CK's fans, and for anyone who thinks that shows like Modern Family and Two and a Half Men are daring and ""real"" in their treatment of the subject of sex. Lucky Louie exposes their contrived, shallow (albeit very clever) writing for what it is.

Lucky Louis has more in common with All in the Family and other Norman Lear series that pushed the boundaries of what could even be discussed on television.

Also notable is the show's depiction of a blue collar family in a blue-collar setting. While most contemporary comedies depict their ""middle class"" characters as casually affluent, The main action of Lucky Louie is set in a run-down apartment (which the characters struggle to afford), in a run down section of an anonymous town, which is filled with vulgar characters who, if not exactly naturalistic in their portrayal, are more truthful in their essence than most TV characters in any genre.

Finally, all of this remarable material is delivered by an extraordinary ensemble, whom I'm going to edit into this review the next time I'm at an actual desktop computer, because my texting finger is starting to hurt.

TL; DR: Lucky Louie is a daring show, informed by creator Louis CK's penchant for testing his audience through transgression. It is funny as he'll. Watch it.",1488412800,,2157,5.056338028169014

2689060,1,B000KF0DFM,"It's easy to see why this didn't get a second season. While it has its moments (very few at that), it more often then not is just swearing because they can (being on HBO). The wise cracking drug dealer friend, in particular, is a waste and goes on tangents that are just offensive rather than funny. The episodes get better as the season goes on, but its too little too late. The daughter getting mouthy and their friend's crazy daughter (played by Emma Stone) moving in are two good episodes that used the HBO freedom in interesting, and funny, use. The real tragedy is that the one really good episode, Clowntime, wasn't even in the original run!

All that being said, I don't offend easy. This show does not offend me, it's just not funny like it wants to be. I can see what Louie wanted to do: a sitcom set in real life. It just goes to far into comedy club funny rather than ""real life"" funny. Hey, lets say f****t and c**t a lot because we can. Plus, I agree with other reviews that point out that the comedy of this show is the exact opposite of what Louie himself does in his stand up and later FX series ""Louie.""

It's worth a watch nonetheless, being only one season. If you're a fan of Louie CK, and especially if you like his FX series, then this is good fodder (especially given that he parodied this very series in one of his Louie episodes).",1483315200,,1356,4.313725490196078

If you have ever seen Louis C.K. in anything, especially his stand up and his later show entitled ""Louie"", you will instantly know that this is the anti-thesis of his true humour. I thought this entire season was a big joke on the audience, like some kind of incredibly elaborate, insanely expensive joke to himself and his close friends. I was expecting him to eventually address the camera directly and admit this was the kind of show that he hates and that you as the audience should never, ever watch it. The low-brow, 90s-sitcom, filmed-in-front-of-a-live-audience, one liners is hard to watch. The cringe-worthiness is absolute. All I could think of while watching this show was the Ricky Gervais ""Extras"" series. In it, the character Ricky got his own sitcom on TV and the producers butchered his creation to the point where it became like just another ""lowest-common-denominator"" sitcom. Maybe that was the entire joke? Or maybe HBO actually did that to Louis' original idea? Then when it failed, FX said they would allow him to do his own show for real.

2689150,1,B000KF0DFM,"I have generally liked Louis C.K. in the past but this show is pretty low brow. I thought he was wittier and more progressive in his thinking, but I guess this show proved me wrong. There is not a single episode that I watched that didn't have several homophobic fag/gay jokes (I got disgusted and stopped watching after episode 8). I thought we were WAY past that! The humor is more than 50% sexual based and gets tiresome pretty quickly. I kept hoping it would get better but it only got worse.",1474848000,,496,4.4021739130434785

It is unnecessarily crude and sex-fixated even for someone like me who seldom if ever complains on that score. The jokes are often unfunny or trite. The supporting cast is singularly unappealing and of limited acting ability. (This includes not only the wife but the daughter as well. His previous two TV ""daughters"" were exceptionally good in comparison, in both looks and thespian abilities.)

Surrounded by misfit friends, in a job that is growing less gratifying, and the message of his world is one of a Godless existence.  A life of meaningless survival with nothing to fill it but sex, bad language, and never a glimpse of joy. Very artificial indeed. Don't bother with watching.

As a woman, I love how all nudity was male including Louie. I'm sick of seeing naked or near naked women on TV and this aspect was refreshing. It's time to exploit a few men for a change, lol.  I loved Lucky Louie and wish it had found its audience before it was cancelled.

2689695,4,B000KF0DFM,"This has some great moments in it. Louis C.K. is very talented, of course, and he tries a lot of different ideas in this sit com format. In this sitcom he has a wife, a low level job and one young daughter.  He has been married for 7 years. The comedy involves his family life whereas his career is very minimal in an auto shop. I think what he used this for was to try out ideas and then learned from his hits and misses on this show how to shape his next show, which became the wildly successful LOUIE, now in its fourth season. That new show is patterned on his real life as a stand up comic and divorced dad of two young daughters and is outstanding. He does all the writing himself for all of his tv and stand up ventures.  His writing has greatly matured since he made this show.  I think this is well worth watching though for the flashes of brilliance which come through in the show and which later come into full bloom in LOUIE.

2689698,4,B000KF0DFM,"I've been a huge fan of Louis C.K. over the past couple years ever since seeing his absolutely hysterical ''Chewed Up'' special on Netflix. I instantly became a fan watching all of his other specials and his show Louie which I find to be one of the best and most original shows currently airing on television. I had been aware of this show for a while and finally decided to check it out.

Lucky Louie is a short-lived HBO show that only aired for one season despite having pretty good ratings. The cancellation behind the show apparently had to do with the network not like having a show that depicted a working class family on a station that is considered ""high class"". It's a shame too because while no where as great as his current show, Lucky Louie is a unique and very funny show that really wasn't giving a fair chance. If you watch this show expecting something similar to Louie though, you'll be very disappointed. The concept of the show is a very simple, an 80's esque sitcom with no boundaries that covers very mature subjects and themes. The show deals with everything from sex to alcoholism and features everything from explicit profanity to full frontal nudity.  In other words, this is not your typical sitcom. But that is what makes Lucky Louie so enjoyable, it's a nice and original idea mixed with Louis brand of humor and the results are mostly hilarious. The cast is very good and the supporting characters are very enjoyable to watch as well. The encounters between Louie and his African-American neighbor as some of the funniest scenes the series has to offer.

With that said, the series does suffer from it's writing occasionally when it feels like it's try too hard to be raunchy and self-aware. A great example of this would be a scene in an episode that involves Louie calling his Wife the ""C-word"" and the aftermath. A scene takes place in a bar with Louie and his friends talking about the word and repeatedly using it. The scene starts out funny, but goes on for too long and begins to feel much more forced and the laughs begin to turn into groans. This problem comes up every once in a while and it's annoying when it does, but it's never frequent or strong enough to ruin an episode or the series as a whole.

It's a shame this show was never given a fair chance as it's a very funny and original show. Although, it's nowhere as great or brilliant than the now-airing Louie is, it's still a very good show that's worth watching if you're a fan of Louis other material.",1395187200,,2502,4.516556291390729

The Blu-rays may be better but neither Lucky Louie or The Wire is offered in that format yet.  Only season 1 and 6 of The Sopranos are on Blu-ray as of right now.

That's why this show is so sad. I tried to like it. I sometimes still watch it when I am waiting to watch Louie (his newer, far more awesome and hilarious and poignant show) with my husband. It's so bad, though! A sitcom with dirty words and very, very bad acting on the part of almost everyone (with the usual exception of Pamela Adlon, who just about never sucks). It is fun to watch mostly to marvel at how bad Louie is in it - he's very nuanced and fabulous in Louie, but in Lucky Louie, he is just so awkward, and not in a funny way. I keep trying to figure out if the sitcom is a joke about sitcoms and it is supposed to be this way? And it was on HBO, so you'd think there would be some kind of smirky this sitcom is so bad it is good (but in this case it went back to bad again, to quote Ghost World).

I hope Louie CK returns to this later in his career.
HBO fumbled a great ball by cancelling this....although
we did end up getting Louie's other TV show.

The 2 shows are very different. I honestly couldn't choose which is better.

I realized, too late, that the 2nd disc is defective on my copy.
A couple episodes wouldn't play at all. The rest would though.

I ONLY mention it because at least one other person here had the same problem.

This DOES NOT mean that every 2nd disc will be defective.

2689777,5,B000KF0DFM,"Lucky Louie was a sitcom produced by and aired on HBO, the premium cable network known for its boundary-pushing dramas like Oz and The Sopranos.  Lucky Louie, however, is just as boundary-pushing, but this time in the form of an average, run-of-the-mill family sitcom.  But, believe me, this is not a show for the whole family to enjoy.

This very adult-oriented series features a normal, everyday working class family and the problems and issues they face raising their daughter and living together in their small apartment.  We have Louie, the stay-at-home dad who works part-time at the Muffler Shop owned by his best friend Mike.  Then we have Kim, the very put-upon wife and mother who works full-time as a nurse and then comes home to take care of Louie and their daughter.  Lucy, a precocious four-year-old, rounds out this small family.

Amongst lots of swearing and male nudity, this sitcom actually has a lot of heart.  The characters and stories are very realistic.  Many viewers will be able to identify with the everyday problems this series deals with.  The show is filmed in front of a live audience, which, even though I'm not sure why, makes it even more entertaining to watch.  I don't want to spoil any of the plots or storylines that weave through this thirteen episode season, so just buy it! You will love it!

The DVDs themselves are top-notch.  The show is presented in widescreen and looks great.  All in all, a wonderful package for a wonderful series!",1187568000,4,1478,4.790513833992095

Louis CK is great, he's one of the greatest comedians I've ever seen. He's not much of an actor but neither is Jerry Seinfeld or Larry David or Mitch Hedberg, comedy is not necessarily about acting. So that aside, I'm still disappointed. It's like when you really love a band and know the tunes they put on that EP that probably sold about 20 copies and then they put out a full length (you know, something that will actually sell) and they put the same dam songs on it. And you wonder, why did you do that? I thought we were moving on, you've recorded this before. that's what watching the only season of Lucky Louie is like if you've seen all of his stand-up repeatedly. I haven't seen his new stand-up special, I'm sure it will be great, but Lucky Louie is nothing more than a complete season of acting out his old, old comedy routines. Which is good, at times, like when he is explaining his nightmares about Hell in the confessional to the father. Priceless. But that only really takes you so far before you say, wait a second the premise of every episode is that he's left in charge of his daughter, he messes it up, his wife gets mad, they make up, everyone is a better person, until next episode when it all begins again. The show is fine, its humourous, but it isn't original, its a little redundant, it lacks the creative spin on traditional topics like marriage and kids that Louis CK made his name on.

This jokes in Louis C.K.'s stand-up create the basis for one of the funniest shows I've ever watched.  Even after watching it several times, still funny.

I found the show incredibly honest and humorous.  Louis C.K.'s comedy is complimented by an incredible supporting cast.  Everyone that I've introduced the show to has enjoyed it and all have asked the question, ""When does the new season start?"".

Louis CK is a brazen, foul-mouthed comedic genius. Pam Aldon plays extremely well off of Louis, which just adds to the quality of the show. The supporting cast is just as foul as everyone else, and that makes me happy. This wouldn't be complete without kudos to everyone's pal li'l Jim Norton, who portrays the worst of them all, Louis' bestest buddy Rich. Happy Birthday Jimmy!!!

While some of the situations took unrealistic jumps (one week they're paying all their bills at a check cashing joint; a few weeks later, they're shopping at Whole Foods and have a bank account), that wasn't the selling point or the main idea of the show.  In many sitcoms, marriage is portrayed as this sickly sweet, conflict-quickly-resolved arrangement with stilted dialogue and trite conclusions, but not one of Louie's episodes ended in this way. In fact, profanity/nudity aside, the depiction of marriage and parenting is one of the most honest that's come across my television.

In ""Discipline"", Louie and Kim are faced with the dilemma of how to discipline their child.  It's not an easy situation and it's not resolved by the end of the episode, though by that point you know enough about the characters to understand that they are going to keep trying to teach their kid how to behave properly.  That, to me, is realistic parenting - a combination of resolve, frustration and pragmatism.

I'm rarely disappointed (except when a really excellent series -- like The Comeback -- is cancelled). So I watched the premiere episode of Lucky Louie. What a disappointment. For the first few minutes, the main actor (I'd never heard of this guy before, apparently he's a comedian) tried in vain to be funny with the actress playing his little daughter. The live audience (I assume it wasn't a laugh track) barely chuckled and I just looked at the TV with an expression of ""Oh my god...it's a train wreck."" So I watched the rest of the episode and didn't laugh, giggle, or even smile. I didn't find this funny or fresh or even vaguely amusing. Some reviewers have pointed out that this seemed so like real life... huh? It all seemed forced and pretty insulting. If you want a working class sitcom (and this is a sitcom plain and simple), Roseanne is the one to beat. Unlike that show, which was funny and profane with wonderful characters, Lucky Louie is a loser with annoying actors and nothing to even make me smirk a little. I tuned in for a couple more episodes to see if maybe I'd missed something. After all, it's HBO and they MUST be doing something a little different, right? Nope. They just made a really unfunny, pretty pathetic sitcom that strained for profane humor and blue collar yucks. Yuck, indeed. I'm so glad this one was cancelled.
