2835045,5,B000Q9IZ48,I have a 5 year old that is pn/tn allergic.  This was great!!  I'm so glad that we found it.  We loved it so much that we bought an extra copy and donated it to the local library!,1360368000,,179,3.6578947368421053
2835046,4,B000Q9IZ48,My neighbor's little boy has severe nut allergies.  I wanted something that would help explain the problem on a 3year olds level.  I am happy to report that my neighbor and her son loved it!,1323043200,,190,4.4
2835047,5,B000Q9IZ48,"I have been a paramedic for 17 years.  My 6 YO son has a peanut allergy that keeps worsening, from ingestion only to touch and ingestion last year.  When he went off to school it was a scary moment for me.  I had to work with the school to keep his Epi pen on him, rather than locked up in the office.  He sits at a peanut free table, but a child with peanut butter hands grabbed his wrist causing a localized breakout.  Other parents sometimes resent the snack restrictions because of my child.

I learned that educating them about the seriousness of this potentially deadly allergy was necessary.  I was lucky and the school was open to my presentation to the class.  I was worried about the 6 YO attention span and presenting the information at an age appropriate level without being too dramatic.

This video and companion printable .PDF of activities for the kids (available from PBS) were absolutely perfect.  The video runs about 13 minutes.  It discusses many things from discovering the allergy to why precautions in school and at home are so important.  It shows an allergic reaction at school and how to react!  It also shows why allergy parents worry about our children.  The PAL cards in the PBS companion activity printout can be carried by children and taken home to parents to help educate them as well. For this age range, I recommend this material.

Thank you to PBS for making this DVD and to Amazon for selling this important information.",1314748800,4,1458,4.618677042801556
2835048,5,B000Q9IZ48,I'm a school nurse caring for numerous students with peanut and other severe food allergies.  This is a great DVD---explains the severity without being really scary for the younger kids.  It explains how scarey allergies are for the both the child and parents of the child.  Other great topics also included on this DVD.,1260662400,2,320,4.888888888888889
2835049,5,B000Q9IZ48,"These shows are packaged around an episode that deals with Binky's peanut allergy. It's a lot more fun than it sounds, believe me. Overall a great and important group of shows.",1251417600,,176,4.709677419354839
2835050,5,B000Q9IZ48,"Personally i think arthur is the best, secretly educational show out there - especially for children 3-7. It teaches understanding and acceptance of our differences, instead of encouraging making fun of what we don't understand. Nobody is perfect and that is nothing to be embarrased about.",1231718400,3,290,5.326086956521739
2835051,5,B000Q9IZ48,"This episode is a GREAT tool for teaching awareness of food allergies.  I have three children ages 8 years, 6 years and 3 years.  My two older children have severe peanut and tree nut allergies.  They love to watch this show.  My children and I could identify with the story.  It details a lot of the issues that go along with food allergies.  For example, Binky does not want to sit at a ""special"" table for lunch because he will feel different and embarrassed.  Also, when Binky is first diagnosed and is told about Ana phylaxis, he wants to know if she (Ana) is in his class.  It goes on to explain exactly what Anaphylaxis is.  It shows what it is like to be a worried parent of a child with food allergies.  It is very educational and yet still entertaining.  I highly recommend this story!!",1221523200,,796,4.383561643835616
2835052,5,B000Q9IZ48,I received this order in a timely fashion; my grandson and I are enjoying it!,1220572800,,77,4.2
2835053,5,B000Q9IZ48,"Our four year old daughter has multiple food allergies, some of which are life-threatening.  Being a preschooler, she absolutely ADORES Arthur and his friends.  Binky is one of her favorites as she, too, is allergic to nuts.  I strongly recommend this video to teachers, parents, etc. who desire to better educate non-food allergic children to the challenges their friends face daily.  It is also a wonderful source of comfort to children who are food allergic as they see through being entertained that there are other kids (and cartoon/book characters) who are like them.  Thank you, Marc Brown, for bringing attention and understanding to food allergic children all across our country through Arthur and his pal, Binky!",1217116800,5,722,5.189655172413793

8195223,1,B000Q9IZ48,"I am very surprised at all the good reviews this movie has received. I guess maybe its because it is beneficial in teaching about allergy awareness, reading food labels and what can happen when exposed to an allergen. Which is great because that is actually why I purchased this. My 4 year old is deathly allergic and will react even if someone touches him after touching peanuts or tree nuts. The problem I have is I'm now sitting up with my son well after his bedtime because he is scared to death to go to sleep in fear of the bad people trying cover him in a big slice of bread dripping with peanut butter like they did to Binky in the movie!!  Its such a shame that we are so limited on educational allergy books, movies and such for our children but when we do get one we find out its a big waste of time and money!!",1485475200,,822,4.169811320754717
8195224,3,B000Q9IZ48,The DVD has other shows that are about school but only the first one is about a nut allergy so it was shorter then I thought maybe like 15min however my son still liked seeing a character that goes through he does on a daily basis,1440633600,,230,4.021739130434782

8195228,5,B000Q9IZ48,"Our granddaughter loves all the Arthur characters, but Binky makes her smile the most.  This episode is good to help children understand some of the allergies that are out there. Great children entertainment.",1396828800,,208,5.303030303030303
8195229,5,B000Q9IZ48,We bought this DVD because Binky learns that he has a peanut allergy. My daughter has a peanut allergy (and I feel like Binky's mom in the show! LOL). and this was a great DVD to play for her and for people who might not understand (especially other little kids).,1392940800,,263,4.28
8195230,1,B000Q9IZ48,"I am amazed by the excellent reviews this terrible DVD has received.  I was so excited to find ""Binky Goes Nuts"" soon after our then almost 3-year-old had a severe reaction to eating only two Peanut Butter M&Ms, his first taste of peanut ever. Because he does not like sliced bread, we had not yet tried p.b and jelly sandwiches. He is also not overly fond of candy but he wanted to try the M&Ms, and I gave him two.  This required a trip to the ER immediately upon his swallowing them, his reaction was so severe--clawing inside his itchy mouth, holding onto me, coughing as though something was stuck in his throat, then projectile vomiting, all within four minutes of ingesting two M&Ms.  So, at that moment we entered the scary, difficult world of peanut allergy and forever carrying two Epi-pens, and as I said, I was so glad to find this DVD to help teach him about the allergy.  I ordered not one but FOUR of them,since our boy loves ""Arthur"". I was planning to share them with his pre-school and other contacts.  Upon watching it,however, I found it to be only a 13-minutes film and the remainder was made up of THREE TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORIES, none of which had anything to do with allergies! Since the title of the DVD, as well as the cartoon illustration on the cover, were related to Binky's peanut allergy, with Binky even holding up a ""No Peanut"" sign, I assumed that this was all a peanut allergy-enlightening DVD.  It is most definitely not.  Now, for the content of the 13 minutes that were dedicated to peanut allergy (sort of).  The first five minutes were confusing to a 3-year-old in that it started out with a big butterfly landing on Binky's arm and he immediately developed hives. But a trip to the doctor assured him he was not allergic to butterflies (why then, the butterfly at the moment he first broke out in hives exactly where the butterfly landed? Why didn't it depict Binky eating peanuts or peanut butter, instead? We will apparently never know). It was all very silly, but not in a teaching way, and very confusing and difficult to pick out the few good points being made amongst the irrelevant parts. Then, after it was established by testing that Binky was allergic to peanuts instead of butterflies(!), he whined and balked at everything his Mom was trying to teach him. He went to the candy store and instead of buying candy, he bought cashews, and very soon broke out again with hives and had to be rushed to the hospital. He pointed out that he did not know he was allergic to cashews and his Mom said he was not. But she had apparently failed to teach him (a 10-year-old) about also not eating food processed in the same plant with peanuts due to cross-contamination! Are you still with me? That night he had a very bad dream, again featuring butterflies--I think.  Note: Even I was getting lost here, and I am an adult and an RN. Then, to top it off, there was yet ANOTHER dream (remember, the entire show was only thirteen minutes) this time a NIGHTMARE, about awful monsters and mean peanuts and somewhere in there a very bad man was talking about SODIUM CHLORIDE allergy! What does any of this have to do with peanut allergy? Binky took up precious viewing time asking, ""What is sodium chloride?"" From at least one of these horrible dreams, he woke up screaming.  I also want to add, his caring mother (and Moms usually bear a very heavyload in peanut allergic children) was treated like a totally annoying ditzy airhead throughout, always peaking in windows at him, and just being a general nuisance and a comic character and being made fun of.  I really don't dislike this DVD, I actually detest it! Possibly, if an older child watched it and had a pretty good handle already on peanut allergies, it might be fairly amusing to watch. But as for little children confused by this sudden life-change, and for older ones who are not allergic, but whom you are trying to enlighten--this video is really, really bad in the opinion of one who has to deal with a precious little guy whom she had to give an Epi-pen on his 3rd birthday, and rush him to the ER again, and who loves Arthur but who got absolutely nothing but confusion from this scary, often irrelevant, very short DVD. Perhaps you and your child will love it, but buyer beware.",1379116800,4,4281,4.553966189856957
8195231,5,B000Q9IZ48,"This DVD is a great tool to teach older elementary-aged students (age 8-11) about food allergy awareness and education. As a school nurse, I presented this to the 5th grade class in order to increase awareness and a greater understanding of fellow classmates affected by food allergies.",1372291200,,286,5.1063829787234045
