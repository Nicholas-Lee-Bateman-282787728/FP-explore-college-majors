8262145,5,B0016CDR0Q,"this DVD was the hit gift of my 5 year olds birthday. Enjoyed this one more than the rest of his gifts together. If a DVD could be worn out, this one would be worn out by now. I can't give any better recommendation. As his daddy, I must admit I love watching it too. It is high quality, and non stop action. God bless Dennis Anderson and his Monster Jam.",1382140800,,354,4.0
