8478689,5,B005LVEFY0,"Near perfect production.  Others have already commented on the superb musicianship.  I will add:  Barenboim plays dressed in a tux, in palace rooms, with conservative and intelligent camera work that does not intrude into the art.  I really appreciate that :)",1384560000,3,259,5.2439024390243905
8478690,5,B005LVEFY0,"This DVD set is a real treat.  It is great to have all of Mozart's piano sonatas in one place.  Barenboim, of course, has been a major artist as both pianist and conductor for decades, and is admirably qualified to give a very fine rendition of these sonatas.  He is well known for performing several cycles of the Beethoven sonatas throughout his career, as well as the Mozart piano concertos, so he clearly has more than adequate technique for the Mozart sonatas.  The venues are the Max-Joseph-Saal in Munich and Schloss Heimhausen, both providing fittingly elegant and beautiful backdrops for the music.  As the recordings were made in 1989 and 1990, they are not up to modern digital standards of video quality, but the picture is clear and unobtrusive, with the sound also being of high quality.  Camera work is very polished, giving good views of his hands and facial expressions, without ever imposing itself on the occasion.  There is no audience, so there is no coughing to disrupt the atmosphere.  Mr. Barenboim's interpretations, to my ear anyway, are spot on.  He brings great fluency of technique molded to  interpretations that are quite satisfying and creative, yet with no hint of imposing his ego on the score whatsoever.  As I follow the scores along with the DVD, I am impressed with the sophistication of Mr. Barenboim's interpretations even more.  As one example, he has a very fluid interpretation of how loud fortes should sound, matching them  carefully to the context of the passage.  The contrast of the relative softness of some of the fortes here to the loudest ones in his Beethoven sonatas is remarkable. If you enjoy Mozart, especially his piano music, you cannot go wrong with this DVD.",1349568000,12,1719,4.882758620689655
8478691,5,B005LVEFY0,"This 3 disc set is a comprehensive collection of the 18 piano sonatas written by Mozart plus the Fantasia in C. The sonatas were written in four groups with the first six being written in 1775 when Mozart was 19. These are conveniently collected together on the first disc. The second disc contains the second group of three written between 117-1778 and the set of four written in 1783. The last six and the Fantasia were written individually during the last years of Mozart's life and are collected together on the third disc.

Barenboim makes an excellent guide through this repertoire bringing crisply enunciated finger-work and avoiding Romantic period overtones. He has a lighter touch than we hear from him these days and this is to the music's advantage. Barenboim had completed a well-regarded set of audio recordings of the complete concertos prior to these later sessions which were held in two venues between 1988 and 1990. These sonata recordings share the characteristics he brought to bear in his concerto recordings and everything has a classical sense of poise and balance that is as relevant today as it was when they were made.

The quality of the recordings here are very good and clearly much care has been taken in their restoration. The camera-work is quietly observant giving plenty of detail without any sense of undue excitement or invasiveness. The sound is presented in good quality stereo, especially for its period. There is no audience so what we get here are in effect well-recorded studio performances which seem to have been recorded in complete 'takes' of either whole movements or whole sonatas. The recording venues were shared between two fairly intimate rooms in the settings of the Schloss Haimhausen and the Max-Joseph-Saal, Munchner Reidenz.

In my opinion this adds up to an invaluable collection of idiomatic performances presented with good recording quality. As such it will be very hard to seriously challenge as a satisfying home experience and it should give much pleasure to future purchasers. In my opinion once more therefore, it seems only reasonable to award this set the full 5 stars overall rating.",1345507200,18,2153,5.042134831460674
