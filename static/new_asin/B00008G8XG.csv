7983429,2,B00008G8XG,There are 4 dvd's in this set I unfortunately own 2 of them Volume 1 and Volume 2.  The price is nice considering you do get 8 episodes per disc.  Thats about the only good thing I can say. The quality is horrible.  The bonus feature has got to be somebodies idea of a joke.  And none of the episodes contain the original theme song. Anybody with a TV capture card and a dvd burner could have made a better collection than this.,1076544000,,428,4.120481927710843
