2884633,5,B000SFK0BG,"I wanted to find something that you didn't have to watch out at the pool, just respond to commands, so this fit the bill!  Very well done.",1407369600,14,138,4.111111111111111
2884634,5,B000SFK0BG,"As a participant in Susanne's classes over the years, I love this DVD. Very motivational!
You can do this! Watch the DVD, grab a Watergym belt and jump in! The water is fine!",1405036800,8,174,4.303030303030303
2884635,5,B000SFK0BG,This is what I expected - it is coming in handy when I'm unable to fit in a group class.  Thank you.,1393372800,7,100,3.5454545454545454
2884636,5,B000SFK0BG,"This is my second year using this CD, with a small group of girls. They all love it. Watch the video first. Then you can follow along on the audio CD. It says you need a water belt. We don't use one because we want a high impact workout. From ages 30 to almost 60 we do it 3 times a week. Its a good full body workout with a variety of moves. I just re- purchased it because I wore out the first one.",1494374400,4,400,3.7176470588235295
2884637,5,B000SFK0BG,"I use it, I get a great water aerobics work out. Recommend it if you're looking for this kind of exercise.",1493942400,,106,4.095238095238095
2884638,5,B000SFK0BG,Love the chart,1484611200,,14,4.0
2884639,5,B000SFK0BG,"Have been using this for a few weeks and really love it. Had been taking deep water classes two days a week, but never could get motivated enough to just do some sessions on my own. Purchased a waterproof mp3 and now can have a full session any time I want. Never get tired of the music used as background. Hopefully they will come out with another Watergym deep water workout; if so, I will be the first in line. Love it!!",1482105600,5,423,4.170731707317073
2884640,5,B000SFK0BG,It was a great workout.,1476403200,,23,3.8
2884641,3,B000SFK0BG,I was unable to use it as I planned.  Participants need the waist weight to do the exercises as presented.  We use an outdoor pool and the sun makes it impossible to see the CD as we are doing the exercises.,1472774400,,207,4.024390243902439
2884642,4,B000SFK0BG,Love the cards with video.  Used for my water aerobic substitute instructor,1471305600,,75,5.25
2884643,5,B000SFK0BG,just what i needed,1469664000,,18,3.75
2884644,5,B000SFK0BG,"Try to keep the folding, laminated guide out of the water. When I moved across the pool to my exercise position, I was dragging it through the water with me rather than keeping it above the water where is was merely splashed from time to time. As a result, the lamination separated at the bottom of one fold and my card got wet inside. This is totally my fault, but its a problem that you can now easily avoid.

The instructions are clear in all formats. I'm glad I have a waterproof MP3 player rather than leaving the recording at the edge of the pool. I never seem to time my movements correctly, so I am almost always far away from the edge when I would need to pause or to start some new activity that requires the edge.

The music is not to my taste, but it is easy to learn the exercises and then do them as I listen to something that I like.",1467590400,6,848,4.102409638554217
2884645,4,B000SFK0BG,All were  ok!,1464307200,,13,3.3333333333333335
2884656,4,B000SFK0BG,I was unable to use it because it is for deep water and the pool we use is only 4 1/2 foot deep.,1447200000,4,96,3.217391304347826
2884657,5,B000SFK0BG,"Love, love, love this program.  It is well designed to work all parts of your body while not building bulging muscles.  The DVD and card are both great aids.",1441065600,6,157,4.379310344827586
2884658,1,B000SFK0BG,Not what I expected. I do water aerobics already and this was difficult to follow.,1439769600,,82,4.533333333333333
2884659,5,B000SFK0BG,"This CD is one of the best exercise CDs that I have ever come across. I needed an instruction CD with fun music to do my water aerobics, so I downloaded it into my waterproof Sony MP3 player and its fantastic. Absolutely love it. Once you learn the exercises, you don't need to look at the instruction card anymore either. I recommend to add fins to increase the resistance of the legs and training gloves to increase the arm resistance as well.",1438905600,5,445,4.439024390243903
2884660,2,B000SFK0BG,Did not provide a real workout routine.  Did provide the moves.  Still need to create my own routine in the pool.  A workout to music at workout pace is what I was seeking.,1438732800,13,172,4.151515151515151
2884661,3,B000SFK0BG,I was looking for a cd that I could play while doing the exercises in the water. This is good and provides a good workout however it doesn't flow well because they seem to start and stop between exercizes. So instead of going right into the next one she explains what to do and so you have to stop and listen.  Then it seems like she switches to the next exercise before you do enough reps of the last one before she stops and starts explaining the next exercise.,1436745600,6,463,4.202247191011236
2884662,3,B000SFK0BG,Ordered the wrong item. Thought I was getting weights with it but is just the tape. Will keep but expensive for what it is.,1435276800,,123,4.166666666666667
2884663,1,B000SFK0BG,This product is outdated.  It should be sold as a download file. It has protection that makes it hard to install on any device. I tried to buy a cd player.  Found one at Target but didn't have an external speaker.  How can I hear music while swimming?  Just need to exercise.,1434067200,4,275,4.230769230769231
2884664,5,B000SFK0BG,I use this at our daily water classes. Easy to follow.,1420243200,9,54,4.0
2884665,1,B000SFK0BG,Did not like this at all. Was not able to follow video. Not user friendly,1408320000,,73,3.933333333333333

anymore?",1508803200,,50,4.666666666666667
8205263,5,B000SFK0BG,Just what we were looking for.,1508716800,,30,4.166666666666667
8205264,3,B000SFK0BG,the cd music and instruction could be better,1507248000,,44,4.625
8205265,5,B000SFK0BG,"This is great.  I can load the exercises on an mp3 player and I am not locked into going for the scheduled classes.  The exercises are not easy, but you get the hang of them quickly.  The DVD shows you what to do and the card acts as a refresher.  Can't say that I have lost any weight, however, but I can tell that my muscles are stronger.",1505865600,,340,3.9558823529411766

8205268,2,B000SFK0BG,This is so outdated! You need to make a more current product,1501977600,,60,4.083333333333333
8205269,2,B000SFK0BG,You have to buy expensive flotation belt to use these exercises.,1500854400,,64,4.909090909090909
8205270,5,B000SFK0BG,This is an excellent product.  I also bought the recommended float belt.  I have a small pool so I can't really swim in it. The water aerobics exercises on this CD were wonderful.  I watched the DVD several times in order to perfect my form.  Then I copied the CD to my iPhone. I use the Bose wireless speaker with the phone.  The music is more Muzak than music but it works. I clipped the laminated foldout of the exercises to the legs of a small table so that it is at the edge of the pool and stays upright.  I get an excellent workout.  I've also done the workout to different music by following the laminated cue card.,1495929600,3,623,4.184873949579832
