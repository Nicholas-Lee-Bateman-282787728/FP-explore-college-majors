4111272,5,B003CYLO42,"This movie motivated me to write my first review.

I read on 'Rottentomatoes' that Extraordinary Measures ""never feels like more than a made-for-TV tearjerker.""  Don't believe it! I am convinced that critics who do critiquing for a living often lose their senses of wonder, along with their senses of humor. After hundreds to thousands of movie viewings, they no longer see the story that makes the acting come alive. They only judge the acting (and that, superficially), and my guess is that most go into the theater with preconceived ideas based on trailers and their personal attitudes toward the actors in the film under review.

So with that out of the way, I will concentrate on the movie which I saw last night.

John & Aileen Crowley and their children, John Jr.,  Megan and Patrick, are the real stars of this movie. Which tells me that the actors who portrayed them did their job well.

As usual in his serious roles, Brendan Fraser brought to the screen the intensity and humanity and reality of John Crowley's decision/quest/obsession for a medical miracle for his children. Brendan is unique. He has been wise in not being stereotyped. As far as I can see, he has much more to bring to life cinematically. His humor is one of his greatest attributes.

Keri Russell is relatable as Aileen. In this condensed version of this part of Aileen's life, I think Keri  allowed us to see into Aileen's emotions and her relationships with her children as well as with John.

The children were played by Meredith Droeger as Megan and Diego Velazquez as Patrick. I was entranced by both children. They were believable and amazing in their mature ability to play children with Pompe challenges, while still showing how the disease does not identify their individuality.  I believe both Meredith and Diego have a great future ahead of them regardless of their paths in life.

Sam M. Hall is a delightful young man who, I feel sure, played big brother John Jr. very much as he is - supportive, loving and responsible. His own challenges came through often with Sam's expressions and responses to difficult situations.

And, of course, what can you say about Harrison Ford that has not already been said. I watched his interview with Charlie Rose, and he said then that his character, Dr. Stonehill, was a compilation of several doctors the Crowleys worked with. His characterization of the medical research personality was probably not all that far from truth. But he naturally gives his  signature personality to the contrary doctor. (I have known some egos like his in the medical field.) In short, he was wonderful. And I truly appreciate his dedication to getting this story to film (along with anyone else involved).

See this film if you have a heart for children. See it if you like any of these actors. (And watch for Dee Wallace. Short but oh so sweet!)",1264723200,108,2859,4.796334012219959

4111296,4,B003CYLO42,"Overall, good movie that accurately depicts the life of John Crowley and his journey to save his children from Pompe disease. Brandon Fraser is a weak link in the movie and does not resemble the real John Crowley (I work for his company and see him quite often). Harrison Ford is his usual irascible self and does a good job as the scientist who helps save the children. Emotional and inspiring story.",1473552000,,401,4.583333333333333

4111299,5,B003CYLO42,"I went and saw this movie in theaters. It was great. Very clean. A film for the whole family. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think the reason it flopped in theaters is because most people tend to be swayed by what critics say. I for one will never listen to any critics. I will watch a movie and decide for myself if it is great or not and If I like it or not. This film had much heart and family values in it. It is a shame most people today want to go see a movie with sex and violence and sick bathroom humor in it. This movie is decent and wholesome and I recommend it for the whole family to watch together. I will not give away what the movie is about so I don't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet. Give this movie a try. You just might like it. For those who like watching good, clean, and decent family-oriented films this is for you. You can watch it alone but I recommend watching it with your family together.",1471305600,13,924,4.0
4111300,5,B003CYLO42,"Arrived Perfectly.

Harrison Ford is superb here.  The arrogant, short-tempered scientist and idealist, who learns friendship and how a friend can stab you in the back, but only after your arrogance gets the better of you, and fuels this backstabbing.  Then, when all seems to be lost, the friendship storm clears, and a life is saved, bringing a sense of justification for the arrogance and idealistic ways, also known as perseverance.",1469664000,,436,5.112676056338028

4111314,4,B003CYLO42,"I honestly had never heard of this movie (and I like watching movies, all different kinds from Independent to mainstream action... okay - I lied I do NOT like watching horror/slasher fics - that's my husbands domain!  LOL) and was watching another blu-ray that had a preview for this - I'm a sucker for feel good and/or true stories to watch every now and again (as true to life as they are once Hollywood gets ahold of them anyways) and picked this up cheap through Amazon to get my fix.

This is a story of a father doing anything and everything he possibly can to help his children diagnosed with a very, very bad disease that because it's such a minority of children that are born with it that they honestly weren't ""REALLY"" trying to find a cure for it (just what I took from this I'm sure it was being researched and trying to find a cure but I'm also pretty sure it got put to the back burner a lot of times).  He crosses the lines many different ways to do what needs to be done to get them any and all help he possibly can.

Brendan Frasier does a great job as the father and Keri Russell was excellent as the mother, but the young actors playing the parts of the children really shined through and made this true story shine.  This is a really good film and if you like this type of movie, I would definitely give it a look see.",1458345600,3,1338,4.2109375

4111324,5,B003CYLO42,A very heartwarming story of a dad desperately trying to find a cure for his sick children.  Very well acted by Brendan Fraser in one of his dramatic roles.

Saving two childrens lives and helping others is a blessed thing but the writers, in my movie going mind didn't concentrate enough on the children and what they were going thru. There is no comparison to Lorenzo's Oil a story with a similar leaning.

I would see it if I were you, but only once. I've seen Lorenzo's Oil about 6 times.

I am always interested in medical breakthroughs brought about by individuals. Way too often it is the huge biotech companies that latch onto a treatment and charge a fortune that the recipients can ill afford. Sad the drug system in the USA has become this way. Greed should not be allowed here. How sad that it is allowed. God would never approve of this unconscionable way of treating people. In my view there are two choices, good or bad.

Maybe they're ""composites,"" too.  So who besides the Crowleys are real and who actually did what to make the magic drug available?  I'm fairly sure that the Crowley kids got the help they need.

4111412,5,B003CYLO42,"This is a wonderful and well told story of hope in medical darkness. It is a story happening every day some place on the earth. It is also a story about safety and government agencies merge with money for those who need a return on investment. Enter the FDA and serious drug makers.

The FDA has some use. But some serious real world issues--such as always backing synthetic drugs even when non-patented options are better but they do not know that since that is not what reviewers study,

and they are also great at attacking compounding natural PharmD.'s or extra trained RPH's doing more than a college degree who use markedly safer and more effective natural hormones instead of patented ones that act in ""unusual ways"" and may increase liver risks with those precious patent add-on parts.

In this amazingly well acted, amusing, touching, and inspiring movie, a solid and real disease is attacked by a series of well meaning people, and you see very well the times when policy and paper work comes before people. And cold, slow and fatal procedures kill in the delay of real cures.

In a discovery I made, the person was dying and vastly ill, and I was able to leave to others the proof over eight years that I was right. Found out in over 150 studies that we were right. But even a humanitarian use of a medication is a process few MD's have time to do, when they are more and more reporting they are bankrupt and hate their jobs and so many who do not know the patient are telling them how to think and treat. So they are going to investigate something that is not the standard of care?

And this is decided by who? You really do not want to know how some standards arise, because many physicians do not know how these arise, even when they think they do.

Further, because the stunning real world reality is simple for a full-time clinician. Due to the explosion of science, in a month, many are behind. And in a year they can be two years behind.

And that is only on the pharmaceutical patent options.

Nevertheless, with stem cells coming from so many tissues, and the explosion of biochemical information, this is a great time to be a health scientist. And if they tell you it has to be clinical or research, just smile, and tell them which is your first interest--because sick people are messy and at times nasty, and research can be cold and highly detailed. But the best people, in my mind, are those depicted in this movie--their profoundly complex science is never divorced from real souls and personalities.

It was only that that made me study boring biochemistry and enzyme typing, and then do a season of ""all-nighters,"" because I could see the benefit, and so could a top journal editor who worked almost every day to rush it to print.

This movie is a marvel.

And everyone involved deserves immense thanks.",1326672000,,2830,4.562130177514793

4111416,4,B003CYLO42,"EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES is a film to watch with family and friends - including and especially children.  It is based on the book by Geeta Anand called `The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million - And Bucked the Medical Establishment - in a Quest to Save His Children' and the title of the book pretty much explains the film.  Adapted for the screen by Robert Nelson Jacobs and directed by Tom Vaughan  it has the courage to tackle a sensitive subject and manage to bring credibility to the struggle between medical research and health care delivery.

It is important to understand the disease that initiates the action and story of this film. Pompe disease is a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness in people of all ages. Pompe disease is caused by a defective gene that results in a deficiency of an enzyme, acid alpha-glucosidase. The absence of this enzyme results in excessive buildup of a substance called glycogen, a form of sugar that is stored in a specialized compartment of muscle cells throughout the body.

John and Aileen Crowley (Brendan Fraser and Keri Russell)are a Portland couple have two children, Megan (Meredith Droeger) and Patrick (Diego Velazquez)with Pompe disease as well as an older child John, Jr. (Sam M. Hall)  who is free of the disease. John is an advertising executive, hears about and  contacts Dr. Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford), a researcher in Nebraska who has done innovative research for an enzyme treatment. He has little money to fund his laboratory, and a thorny personality that drives away colleagues and funders. John and his wife Aileen raise money to help Stonehill's research and the required clinical trials. John takes on the task full time, working with venture capitalists and then rival teams of researchers. Time is running short, Stonehill's angry outburst hinder the company's faith in him, and the profit motive may upend John's hopes. The researchers race against time for the children who have the disease.

Among the beautiful moments and messages of this film are the reactions of the children to their disease, Dr. Stonehill's hermetic existence in researching a disease about which few fellow scientists seem to care, and above all the devotion of the Crowley's to overcome the hurdle that face them in bringing the research home to the benefit of their own children as well as to the afflicted children around the globe.  The cast is uniformly strong and involve us in the quest for the support simple people bring to the discovery of cures.  Grady Harp, November 11",1322092800,,2573,4.990654205607477
4111417,2,B003CYLO42,"This doesn't feel like a real movie.  I think that is my biggest complaint here.  It feels like a `made for television movie', complete with sappy and manipulative music that swells in all the right places and performances that carry wet eyes throughout the entire running time.  This film feels like a Disney tragedy; like `Finding Neverland' minus the `prestige' staging and the cinematic qualities.  It also runs the gamut of extremely unrealistic in parts, which is sad because I know that this is based on a true story.  It just feels farfetched and overworked, where the tension sadly feels overtly manipulated.  The core of the film is the heartwarming story of a couple who will stop at nothing to save their children from early deaths thanks to the harsh yet rare disease with no known cure that is rapidly devouring their bodies.  John Crowley stays up late researching the disease and finally, when all else has failed him, he lies his way into business with a rogue scientist on the verge of a medical breakthrough (aren't they all).  While the `happy ending' may be assumed, getting there is a tear-fest and be prepared to go through a box or two of Kleenex while watching this one.  It's all force-fed, that's for sure, but if you don't cry then your heart is stone.  The script is a mess and the dialog is ridiculous at times.  Still, Brendan Frazer and Harrison Ford put in some of the best work of their careers; even when Ford tries to impersonate Clint Eastwood and Fraser loses any grip on his body language (the man uses some weird hand gestures when he's excited).  Some great acting in a really bad movie, but whatever.  Some will love this, sure...it is a family film that will touch your heart.  But, underneath that emotional reaction there is a film that is little more (or maybe even a little less) than a Lifetime special.",1318809600,3,1851,4.655384615384615

4111419,5,B003CYLO42,"For those of you who remember December of 2009, and the unbelievable amount of relentless commercials Extraordinary Measures would receive around Christmas that year... you'd understand that it darn well *better* be a good flick, and... it is.  Thankfully!!!

It's about Brendan Fraser playing the role of a father who has two children with a fatal disease that leaves them in a wheelchair, and Harrison Ford plays the part of a scientist who actually has the cure.

The storyline mainly focuses around both Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford trying desperately to legalize this special medication but always having to put up with *someone* stepping on their toes in an attempt to try and stop the two of them from making the cure available.  It even reaches a boiling point when they eventually turn against each other.  As a result, expect both Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford to travel heavily around the country, mainly from Seattle to Nebraska to Portland, in a desperate search for legalization of this highly advanced medicine.

Now, remembering very clearly that I was forced to deal with the countless amount of advertisements for this film 17 months ago, I had a good feeling it would have a very distinct Hallmark-type style.  You know, sort of low budget, with a positive message to send the viewers home happy.  Well... it sort of does, truth be told, but honestly the storyline turned out to be compelling enough to keep me totally interested in it from beginning to end, which is sort of surprising to me.  So my final verdict is that I can't possibly find Extraordinary Measures overrated and all those commercials I had to put up with WAS worth it after all.

By the way, doesn't Harrison Ford look exactly like Mark Harmon from the hit show NCIS?  Even his strick and ultra serious mannerisms in this film were identical.",1308960000,4,1838,4.840255591054313

My biggest problem with this film is that is never seems to go deeper than the surface on the subject. There are a few scenes where I thought we were going to get a much deeper dialogue, but instead we are treated to a little music montage to mask over any script deficiencies. This gives the film a TV movie quality at times.

The actors are all in the moment and who can't feel sorry for anyone who has to deal with such a catastrophic disease. When the film started I didn't even think I wanted to continue to watch it as it just seemed too depressing, but when the story unfolds into the parents search for a cure it draws our focus to that task.

The movie follows one father, John, (played by Brenden Fraser) and his family, as he struggles, along with his wife, Aileen (played by Keri Russell), to help his two children who are living with a genetic debilitating disease, called Pompe.  After his daughter is hospitalized and almost dies, he decides to track down a lone researcher, Dr. Stonehill (played by Harrison Ford) to find out how he can help his two children survive past their ninth birthday.  Dr. Stonehill gives him the bottom line, aside from working on the right protein, it all comes down to money.  And so begins a unique, and sometimes volatile relationship between the two men, as they wade through unknown territories, and greedy investors, of what it takes to bring research, to a viable product, and to bring that product through FDA guidelines and to the marketplace.  What a roller coaster ride!

Nary a gulp when addressing the AMR and profit margins b/c thank the Lord this Rx is needed for life! Great script for non-scientific audience. Best line: ""Glad we dodged that blessing!"" comment truly encapsulized the bottom line of his children's lives in the scheme of many physician's apathy.  The complexities of enzyme research and drug marketability, VC partnerships, creative but desperate measures to raise necessary funds, and the ever present ticking clock, made this film a rare triumph in bringing a true story to screen.  Although very much like Lorenzo's Oil, the outcome is much more productive and was quite envious of those who have what it takes to truncate this timeline for a cure.  The young Megs was the star in every scene and Harrison was slightly over the top IMHO, and Keri... I just can't get over her first TV series NYU character.

The plot is somewhat predictable; however, unusual means are employed to achieve the end, but I'll leave that to you to see how it was done.

My special connection to this film came as a result when at my son's graduation from Neumann College (now University) at Aston, PA, in 2009, the real John Crowley (the father of the two children afflicted with Pompey's Disease) actually was present at the commencement ceremonies to receive an honorary Doctorate Degree for his efforts to help bring attention and action to find a means to stop the onslaught of Pompey's Disease and allow his children and others to at least live a better life than to slowly waste away and eventually die.  His wife, Aileen, also was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in absentia, but couldn't be present because of having to stay at home to take care of their children, who require constant care.

Another reviewer felt that Harrison Ford was miscast in this film.  To the vast majority of movie goers who are used to seeing this actor in swashbuckling roles, I can agree, though at some time in their careers, I feel that it is to the credit of an actor or actress if they feel that they can give a credible performance in a role different from what everyone is used to seeing them in.  I feel that Harrison Ford did rather well in his role as Dr. Stonehill.  However, I would have liked to have seen what the actual Dr. Stonehill looked like, or to have at least to appeared in the extras to this film and give his take on his efforts to find the means to stop the onslaught of Pompey's Disease.  Nowhere do we see/hear anything about the real-life Dr. Stonehill.  It is quite likely he is the recluse that the film depicted him as.",1291420800,,2110,4.954674220963173

4111438,5,B003CYLO42,"Director Tom Vaughan does an outstanding  job directing this film, bringing in stellar performances by one of my all-time favorite actors Harrison Ford (Dr. Robert Stonehill) and Brendan Fraser (John Crowley). Based on a true story, it's about Crowley's desperate struggle to save two of his children who have Pompe Disease, a rare, life-threatening illness.

Although the movie portrays the usual life-span for children with this condition as eight or nine years, in real life, most children with Pompe disease would die before age two. There is also a juvenile and adult form which can present at almost any age.

One of the first scenes is of Crowley's daughter enjoying her eighth birthday party. The little girl has an optimistic, radiant personality and Meredith Droeger plays the part to perfection. This is a bittersweet scene because viewers know the spirited little girl might not have long to live. Her brother (played by Diego Velazquez) is six, so he has a few more years. The relationship between the parents and their children--including the one not afflicted with this awful disease--will make you cry one minute, laugh the next.

The father is relentless in his search for information that might help his children, so when he learns of Dr. Stonehill's theory about a cure for this disease he tries to reach the eccentric, elusive, cranky scientist. After several failed attempts, he finally tracks him down and talks him into helping. Stonehill needs funding for research to prove his theory, but is positive it will work, so he offers to help if Crowley can raise the funds.

Crowley's wife Aileen, played by actress Keri Russell, is concerned about living expenses when he risks it all by quitting his well-paid position as a biotechnology executive to pursue funding. Nonetheless, she pitches in and supports him all the way. They will do anything to save their children's lives.

There are many interesting twists and turns in this movie as Crowley and Dr. Stonehill race against time. They bump heads with other, more money-oriented scientists who block their progress in unexpected ways. Dr. Stonehill is set in his ways, so doesn't add to the harmony between Crowley and the ""establishment."" During these scenes we gain knowledge of how medical research is conducted and financed. Quite fascinating...

This superb movie is adapted by Robert Nelson Jacobs from a nonfiction book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cure-How-a-Father-Raised-100-Million-and-Bucked-the-Medical-Establishment-in-a-Quest-to-Save-His-Children/dp/006073440X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million--and Bucked the Medical Establishment--in a Quest to Save His Children</a>&nbsp;by the Pulitzer Prize journalist Geeta Anand.

There is plenty of action offset by surprising touches of humor in this movie, which is one I would not have missed for the world. Just to see the magnetic performances by Ford and Fraser is well worth the price of admission. They work surprisingly well together and I'm delighted to see Fraser in a dramatic role like this; he is the heart of this movie.

This is a suspenseful family drama that I recommend highly--a movie that proves that miracles still happen...

4111442,3,B003CYLO42,"This movie has good points and bad points.  First the good points - Brendan Fraser, Keri Russell, and the young actors who portray their children in this film do a great acting job.  The movie leaves you with hope, inspiration, and applauding the determination of an extraordinary family.  The bad points - Harrison Ford quickly gets irritating.  In almost every scene it seems like he is yelling.  Also, the storyline is predictable - just read the title of the movie and you can figure out the ending.

The premise of the movie evolves around the Crowley family who have two children born with Pompe disease.  They are not expected to live past age nine, and the Crowley parents are desperately searching for anything that will help prolong the lives of or cure their children.  Enter Dr. Robert Stonehill, a research scientist from Nebraska with the potential answer to their problem.  Joining forces, the Crowleys and Dr. Stonehill battle the medical community and seemingly insurmountable obstacles to race against time and try to save children suffering from Pompe disease.

This movie has many uplifting moments and feel-good scenes.  The fact that it is also based on real-life circumstances helps makes the movie inspirational.  However, as you watch the film, you will already feel like you know everything that is going happen, which makes the movie slightly dull.

4111445,3,B003CYLO42,"Tom Vaughan's Extraordinary Measures could should have been a really great film but unfortunately it ends up feeling like a made for TV movie of the week. We have all the ingredients for a really good television film: sick children, parents willing to do anything to save them, somewhat difficult researcher that may have a cure. However when you put all this together the one thing that you don't get with Extraorninary Measures is a great feature film.

Brendan Fraser plays John Crowley a middle executive who gives up a secure job to hunt for a cure that will save his children who are suffering from Pompe disease,a rare genetic relation to muscular dystrophy that kills most of its victims by the age of nine. Into his fight he enlists the support of underfunded reseacher Dr. Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford) who may have the means of developing a cure. The film takes us on a predictable journey as the two begin the long process of not only creating a marketable drug but of persuading the drug companies to buy into their plan and actually funding a drug which will be utilized by a very small segment of the population.

The acting by Fraser and Ford is quite good and rises well above the level of the story. Competent support is provided by Keri Russell as Crowley's supportive wife and by  Meredith Droeger  and Diego Velazquez as the ill children. The main issue seems to be that the viewer has seen this all before in many television films.

The Blu Ray disc presents an array of extra features including some short deleted scenes, a portrait of the real Crowley family with interviews with John and Aileen Crowley and a decent making of featurette.

The movie uses the special relationship a father has with his daughter in order to move him to seek out a cure for Pompe. His son, who also has the illness, is marginalized in this film. Fraser, as en executive seeks out the help of anti-establishment Deadhead Dr. Stonehill, (loosely based on the real life Dr. Canfield) who has the best research on the subject. In real life Dr. Canfield had founded his own company and Fraser (Crowley) left his job to go work at this smaller firm, but that doesn't make good drama, as kids dying in wheel chairs isn't enough of an emotional roller coaster ride for us.

""Extraordinary Measures"" presents John Crowley (Brendan Fraser), his wife  Aileen (Keri Russell)  and their children, John Jr. (Sam M. Hall), Megan (Meredith Droeger) and Patrick (Diego Velazquez).  Both Megan and Patrick Crowley have Pompe disease and are not expected to live past their eighth or ninth birthday.  John and Aileen decide that prognosis is unacceptable and become determined to find a cure.

The Crowleys learn that professor Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford)  at the University of Nebraska Is close to finding a treatment for Pompe.  They solicit Stonehill's help and  form a company dedicated to discovering a cure for this terrible disease.

As I watched the science progress, I began to understand the difficulty of performing biochemical research and the near impossibility of taking a new drug to market.  The challenges of financing and the difficulty of getting FDA approval became clear.  The dialogue seemed real and the science understandable.  The script writers for this film produced a scientifically clear script.

Harrison Ford plays a biochemist who is technically superior, but unable to communicate without creating stress.  This is a very different part for Harrison Ford but he presents a believable, old codger academic who struggles with interpersonal communication.

Brendan Fraser is outstanding as a sensitive, persistent John Crowley who gently pushes for solutions.  Keri Russell  appears a concerned mother desperate to save her children.  Meredith Droeger and Diego Velazquez are wonderful as the Pompe plagued children.  Unlike many child actors, these two talented youngsters appear natural and convincing in their roles.

EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES asks if it is worth risking everything for a single achievement? Love and family make risks a quick choice. For the real and movie Crowley family--it worked. For others, it might build hope. This excellent film is about defying the odds--gamble vs love--& sometimes winning. Emotional? YES! Real life is emotional.

John Crowley (Brendan Fraser), at a loss dealing with 2 children having Pompe disease (muscle illness, no Rx help, life expectancy of 9 yrs) looks to a Univ. of Nebraska Dr/researcher, Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford) for help. This may be one of Ford's best performances: emotional, funny, tough. He plays a maverick, soured, calloused, aging, poorly funded researcher who finds his own heart through the Crowley family. Awesome, realistic, portrayals by both men. Not to be upstaged, the mom, Aileen (Keri Russell) has her own moments and makes this EXTRAORDINARY scenario very believable.

John mixes his emotional experience as a parent with the profit motivated Zymagen drug firm. Aileen is at his side-most of the time. Deleted scenes show there was additional marriage and stress conflict needing reconciled. A family film, but really aimed at adults--and it hits the bull's eye.
If nothing else, the movie empathizes with families dealing with a disease prior to a pharmaceutical breakthrough. That is a heart-wrenching emotional battle.

Unfortunately unextraordinary.

I just watched this one and must say I am amazed to see that all 7 reviews here are five stars. As much as this true story was moving, I found the movie's treatment of it predictable in every way: overwrought, manipulative, ham-handed and thoroughly ordinary...at best.

Nothing here worked for me except the one scene with all the Pompe families gathered with the scientists. When the black father spoke, I could finally really feel something coming from the screen. He had real passion, and I can only guess that all those real Pompe kids in one place inspired the entire production. It's a moving moment.

But almost all of the rest of this very tv-feeling movie is so sadly unextraordinary. Ford and Fraser do their best but somehow these two fine actors seem off here. Is it the script, hokey as it often is? After watching the short but fine dvd extra documentary on the real life John Crowley and his family, I saw how sanitized and prettified the screen story truly was. Must everything be so Hollywood? The real story had more life for me in four minutes than the long 100 minutes of the film.

A great director inspires the cast and crew and the story comes to full life on the screen. There is electricity. Here there is everything that suggests electricity, but almost none of the real crackle. It all feels flat, and the incredibly average, sappy and manipulative music seems lifted from any of a hundred expensive soap operas. The acting rarely takes off into depth and intensity. And some of the looping (off-camera dubbing by the actors) is simply miserable. In the bar scene you can actually hear Ford's voice go up and down and up again as the edit is done; there's no excuse for that kind of shoddy editing in a big-budget movie. One can only blame the director for all of these final decisions.

Which is all really a shame, as the story is wonderful, with real-life happy ending and all. But something just feels off in this movie, and it's hard to put my finger on it. I thought I'd gone nuts when I saw all the praise here, so I checked the combined ratings of this movie from 129 critics around the world on Rotten Tomatoes; it got a 28% thumbs up, which to me seemed sadly about right. But then again, they each watch about a thousand movies a year, so what would they know about good filmmaking?

For all its good intentions and heart-wrenching true story, Extraordinary Measures is all too standard and never comes close to the power it could have had. The short dvd documentary on the real family has far more power, and authenticity, than this very Hollywood movie.",1274400000,3,2637,4.597872340425532

Brendan Fraser is very good in this role, as is Harrison Ford as the grumpy, temperamental research scientist whose findings may hold the answers.

The kids are a bit too precocious, esp. the girl, in their performances.  Otherwise, this is a great story of being determined to find a means of helping kids.",1274400000,,474,4.488372093023256

It's about a family with two children, both of whom have a terminal, genetic disorder and have a matter of months to live. Their father researches the disorder, as best he can.  He finally locates an eccentric scientist (Harrison Ford) a professor at a university, whom he believes can invent a drug and bring the drug to market in time to save the lives of his chidren. He quits his job and makes this quest his number one priority. It is a race against the clock, with many twists and turns in the plot.
To say more would be to ruin the enjoyment of many viewers. I will say that it is very suspenseful and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time in the theater. Both the plot and the acting are supurb! Buy and enjoy.",1273363200,,972,4.142857142857143

I won't even pretend to know the facts about Pompe disease. But what I do know is movies. And I take very much pleasure in squashing the opinions that Extraordinary Measures is a bad film and a cheesy film and that it belongs on a day-time old lady channel like Lifetime, rather than in mainstream theaters across our beautiful nation. It was fantastic.

Brendan Fraser stars as John Crowley, a father desperate to save his two children who are dying from the horrible disease. When he hears of a doctor who's been working on a cure, he attempts to call on him for help. After a very well written scene of him trying to get the hermit of a doctor on the phone, he flies to his hometown in Nebraska for a chance meeting of face to face.

Dr. Robert Stonehill is played by Harrison Ford. He's a man with the letters D and R in front of his name but rather than the victims, it's the scientific structure of the disease he finds a fascination in.

Fraser's character John is supported by his loving wife Aileen (Keri Russell). The film has received some slack in regards to their relationship being two dimensional, but I can clear that up right now with two little words: It's not. The scene they share early on, when they are interrupted by the babysitter, was more than enough to shed light on their relationship. The film doesn't dwell on their relationship, because that's not its focus. The focus is on the disease and their children dying from it.

John sees something in Stonehill regardless of his eccentric behavior and often cold personality. He works relentlessly to get him on his side and eventually it pays off. The two team-up and set forth to find a cure for this God-awful disease.

Fraser and Ford may seem like an odd match, but what they do on film together is amazing. Fraser, who is primarily known for his funnier roles, is a very talented actor. He's never overpowered by the pressure of sharing a scene with Ford and both of them deliver in every scene.

One of the things that make the film so enjoyable other than the great performances is its ability to make us cry and seconds later have us laughing out loud. This was a continuing factor throughout the film, and it's not an easy one to pull off. Extraordinary Measures could easily be the most underrated film of 2009. Don't miss it.",1268784000,57,2672,4.627906976744186
