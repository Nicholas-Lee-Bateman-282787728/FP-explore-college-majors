3871546,4,B00281XB3C,"The ""Dinosaurs Inside and Out"" DVD contains four episodes: ""Renaissance of the Dinosaurs,"" ""Land of the Giants,"" ""The Killer Elite,"" ""And Then There Were None."" The DVD might be better named ""Paleontology Inside and Out"" because each episode describes more about how paleontologists research dinosaurs than about the actual dinosaurs. Anyone who wants to be a paleontologist or who wonders how they work in the field and in the lab will find the DVD very worthwhile.

The first episode, ""Renaissance of the Dinosaurs,"" gives a brief history of paleontology and describes some of the very important finds, like Jack Horner's ""Egg Mountain."" Research to uncover the very first Triassic dinosaurs in Argentina is covered late in the episode.

The second episode, ""Land of the Giants,"" describes how paleontologists study the giant Sauropods of the Jurassic to estimate their weight and how much land area it tool to support the eating habits of a large Sauropod. Other paleontologists study Sauropod trackways to see how they interacted and calculate how fast they could walk.

The third episode, ""The Killer Elite,"" describes how paleontologists find and dig up various Theropod dinosaurs like T. rex and the raptors. The legal battle and auction of ""Sue"" the T. rex is covered.

The fourth episode, ""And Then There Were None,"" describes various theories about why the dinosaurs became extinct and how paleontologists are researching the extinction. The episode describes how climate change, disease and a killer asteroid could have brought about the end of the dinosaurs.

In 1998 I would have given this DVD five stars. But I bought this DVD, pre-release, from Amazon.com in May 2009 and was very disappointed to find that while the DVD is copyrighted 2009, the episodes are copyrighted 1997. I was expecting to get some of the latest information about dinosaurs but that's not going to happen with information from the last century. So, I took one star from the rating because the information, while good, is dated.

Generally, the program production quality, like the photography and narration, is very good. But there are a couple of exceptions. There are a few clips of computer generated dinosaurs that are reused in the various episodes in an attempt to show living animals. Thankfully, these clips are very short because they are very amateurish even by 1997 standards. The running T. rex is particularly laughable. If these clips were longer, I would have removed another star from the ratings.

Some of the music, like the main theme and some background music, sounds like it came off the shelf of a free electronic music library. It sounds like what you might expect to hear in a zero budget movie or porn flick. That's kind of surprising given that these episodes are Discovery Channel productions.

If you want to see how paleontologists work and aren't concerned about the latest research like dinosaur genetics, buy this DVD. But if you want more up-to-date information on dinosurs, you should buy the Discovery Channel's ""Essential Dinosaur Pack.""",1244160000,58,3062,5.11

3871552,1,B00281XB3C,I received the dvd a couple of weeks before Christmas. It was a gi\ft for my son. I was disappointed when he opened it on Christmasmorning to discover the dvd was briken in 3 pieces. My daughter has cancer and started chemo the next morning. I was not able to contact anyone about the movie till now. I was complegtely dissatisfied!,1359158400,,332,4.459016393442623
3871553,2,B00281XB3C,"This DVD is no where near as good as other films that Discovery has done. They can't even spell renaissance correctly on the DVD menu. Bought this for my 8 year old, who is a dinosaur fan, but some of the footage seem to be the same that is at the Field Museum in Chicago. Major disappointment for us.",1337817600,,301,4.11864406779661
3871554,5,B00281XB3C,"I had held off on getting this DVD because some on here have said that the quality was low, but being a dinosaur nut and documentary collector, I could not hold off for long.

These programs are more in line with what I used to watch as a young, aspiring paleontologist. In my personal opinion, dinosaur documentaries these days rely too much on advanced computer graphics technology. Some of the technology is fantastic, but the amount of learning is minimal at best. Most of the learning has to do with what the animal is doing on screen at that time. The T-Rex senses danger, the apatosaurus feeds, etc. Not really anything on the overall behaviors of the animals or why we think they behaved in that way.

It is true that the documentaries on this DVD focus on the activities of paleontologists, but you absolutely HAVE to understand how these people work to understand where current hypotheses regarding dinosaurs originated. Otherwise, you are just watching a TV show. This type of in-depth learning is good for kids and I'd encourage parents to let their kids give programs like this a fair shot. Maybe they will want to be scientists one day. I know I did.",1330387200,5,1164,4.673170731707317
3871555,2,B00281XB3C,"How fasinating these type DVDs are.  And, one learns so much re: the evolution of this planet.  I wasn't, however, very impressed with this particular DVD.",1296950400,,155,4.923076923076923
3871556,2,B00281XB3C,"Like so many other reviewers, I got this DVD for my 3.5 year old son yesterday who is fascinated by dinosaurs. It was very boring, and I felt deceived by the metal box in which it came which somehow led me to believe that it was more about animated computer graphic recreations of dinosaur life, not scenes upon scenes of paleontologists digging around for bones and interviews with scientists.

I'm not saying it's a bad DVD. Surely an older crowd can appreciate it. But this is definitely not what I was looking for for my toddler.",1290556800,,533,4.552083333333333
3871557,4,B00281XB3C,"Despite the incredibly tacky and lurid cover (and decidedly no-frills packaging in general), this is a competent and entertaining series. Nothing that a well-versed dinosaur enthusiast doesn't know, but a pretty intro-level series. Watchable and informative. Better than the horrible cover would indicate.",1289520000,,305,6.116279069767442
3871558,5,B00281XB3C,Worth a watch. If you love dinosaurs then add this to your collection. The kids ( 13rs & 15yrs )were fascinated by it.,1286755200,2,118,4.173913043478261

WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT! we all sat down as a family to watch...didn't hold anyones attention for more than a minute. i would scan through desperately trying to find something other than a paleontologist talking about fossils or footage of digging...to no avail. if you're hoping to watch a movie about discovery of dinosaurs that the life they lived this is not the dvd for you. however, if you want a dvd with interview footage...this is it!!",1280275200,19,725,4.534351145038168
3871560,3,B00281XB3C,I purchased this for my grandson because he likes dinosaurs but it was not what I expected.  The preview write up on this DVD is not what I thought I purchased.  The preview sounded more like a movie than a documentary.  My grandson lost interested almost immediately.  I have it put up for when he is a little older.,1279411200,,317,4.322033898305085
3871561,1,B00281XB3C,"I purchased this video for my son's 4th birthday who loves dinosaurs.  He was extremely disappointed when we put the video on and he just wanted to see the dinosaurs.  It is all about the digging and searching for the dinsaur bones with talking, talking, talking by men!!  He hated it and was very upset.  If I could return it, I would!!",1278374400,7,337,4.387096774193548
3871562,4,B00281XB3C,"I personally can't really rate this movie.  I get this movie for a young friend that lives in Chicago, IL.  He is my friends' young son that lives documentary about dinosaurs.  He collects any documentary movies on dinosaurs.  This movie was on his list, so I went ahead and get it for him.  He loves it.",1270598400,,304,4.357142857142857

3871565,5,B00281XB3C,"If you want to learn about Dinosaurs, the people who look for them and how they find them, this is an excellent video. It also describes different views on the extinction of Dinosaurs, as well as new information on how some of them lived. I was also very surprised that it contained information on finds in Argentina! There is also some information on the Jurasic. Most videos concentrate on the Cretaceus, I don't know if it's due to lack of information or the popularity of T-Rex. If you want to learn, not just be entertained I recomend this video.",1258848000,7,551,4.575757575757576
3871566,1,B00281XB3C,I am very disappointed in this.  It is a documentary and there is barely any dinosaurs on it!!!!!  Not worth getting for a toddler:(,1245715200,10,132,4.458333333333333
