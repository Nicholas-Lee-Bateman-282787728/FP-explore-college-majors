8004667,5,B0000YHVMQ,"I am impressed with this product. The presenter obviously knows the field well from a professional and hands-on perspective. Presentation-format-wise it is very plain, basically a guy standing in a classroom lecturing the material, with some (helpful) questions from audience members, who seem to have some sophistication. The presenter also shows many examples, pitfalls and situations that can arise. Before viewing this, I had some jitters about performing some of these tasks, and now I feel much more comfortable and competent with it. Going in, the viewer should have some basic accounting knowledge to understanding the terminology and situations.
I don't know where else I could have got this instruction this cost-effectively and without reading a big book, for which my time is limited. This does the job for me.",1367971200,,822,5.3307692307692305
