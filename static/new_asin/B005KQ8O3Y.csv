8477080,1,B005KQ8O3Y,"I love the opera and the production is interesting, even if in the current fashion of filling the stage with action at all times. The serious problem is the support: both discs deteriorated in about one year time to the point that I can now see only the beginning of each of them",1379721600,,279,4.283018867924528
8477081,2,B005KQ8O3Y,"This blu-ray disk deserves two stars because the video quality is high. The picture is sharp, the colors rich. The video director skillfully mixes closeups and panoramas. Unfortunately the sound quality is not quite so high. The tone is slightly echoey and distant, unflattering to singers. Even Ramon Vargas, who displays his beautiful voice and musicianship in many other recordings, sounds dry and slightly hollow. Nadja Michael, whom I haven't heard before, barely sounds like a singer, rather like an actress pushing her voice at particular pitches in certain rhythms, rarely getting results that sound like music.

The staging is self-congratulatingly ugly. The multi-purpose set looks like a prison most of the time, populated by a motley of apparently symbolic groups. Some viewers may enjoy the challenge of trying to discern the director's intent. To me it looks like incoherence for its own sake. The images tend to the repulsive. For example, a smirking ballerino in suspenders and aluminum foil Cupid wings flits around Medea and Jason during their duet, then mutilates himself. The one truly appealing image is the presence on stage of the violin soloist during Medea's aria. The contrast of the cool, elegant violinist and the overwrought vocalist is visually striking. Unfortunately, it also emphasizes the disparity between lovely violin and disagreeable voice.",1352851200,4,1378,5.37962962962963
8477082,5,B005KQ8O3Y,"I discovered this opera after reading a review of it in the OPERA NEWS, that interested people should consult too. I was watching it extensively since then and I must tell that I am extremely grateful to the Opera of Munich to revive this rare work. It made me a lover of Bel Canto (I am an addicted Wagnerian for years !). Yes, extra violence was added (as if the real subject - a mother killing her own two children - was not violent enough ) and the timing of the action was moved closer to the present. But we are all used to such deconstructions by now and it does not affect the quality of the singers nor the superb acting. Equally fascinating are the appendices to the production, like the interview with the singers, the conductor and even the ... souffleur ! My dominating thoughts after learning about this work are that:
1)What an unknown genious the composer Giovanni Simone MAYR is and how I am glad that  I discovered him,
2) Despite the extreme violence, what a fascinating myth MEDEA is, fascination well reflected in the number of operas, plays and art dedicated to the subject. Among other MEDEA operas let me mention only two : One also Bel Canto style by Luigi Cherubini (2 production DVD's are available) and one more modern, reminding of Shoenberg music - 12 tones -  by Riemann ( a DVD is available).",1340236800,2,1324,4.4896265560165975
8477083,3,B005KQ8O3Y,"I was practically doing cartwheels when I found out that a Mayr opera was going to appear on DVD. Over the last twenty years or so, he has become one of my favorite late 18th-early 19th century composers.
What I hadn't counted on was a Hans Neuenfels deconstruction job. After admitting that the stage production isn't boring for a minute,it becomes clear within the first ten minutes that Neuenfels began planning before he heard a note of Mayr's music ! He began thinking about Medea and not Mayr's and librettist Romani's Medea.
The composer and librettist, turn the legend into a conventional bad girl/good girl melodrama, a forerunner of Wilkie Collins type storytelling. The political subtext which Neuenfels brings to the fore is barely present in Romani's libretto, and not at all in Mayr's music. The subtext is really that opera fans are stupid, and that Mr. Neuenfels is going to set us straight !
Here we have a Creusa considerably nastier than Medea. She is cold, cruel and spoiled. The problem is that Mayr didn't write cold, cruel spoiled music. Throughout, there is a major disconnect between the music and the bloody violent images. Some that come to mind are throats being slashed (frequently), stabbings (a genial ballet boy with Victoria's Secret type angel wings, for no apparent reason, stabs himself in the genitals at the end of the first Medea-Jason duet), there are gang rapes, whipping, and garroting, none of which are reflected in the music. Servants are mistreated, and several messengers are shot ! (In the odd moment of discretion, Medea kills her children off-stage.)
Creusa's bridesmaids are costumed in 1950s outfits, as are most of the characters, while inexplicably Creon ,Egeo and Ismene wear 19th century costumes. (Creon's costume and wig almost a dead ringer for that of one of the characters in the Chereau RING. Intentional ?)
In purely musical terms, things are much happier. Nadia Michael has mastered most of the role of Medea. Only a few less than polished coloratura passages mar a near perfect performance. She is a lithe, muscular presence, easily able to go through the physical contortions that Neuenfels demands of her while singing ! (She makes an entrance in a grass skirt and half mask, amazingly the audience doesn't laugh,and spends most of the rest of the opera in ""a little black dress"".)
Elena Tsallagova sings beautifully as Creusa, and manages to project Neuenfels' nasty concept without marring Mayr's beautiful vocal lines. (One of the oddest moments in the production is when Creusa starts torturing an old Jewish couple, for what appears to be no other reason than that she doesn't want to be reminded that she and Jason will grow old.)
The two tenors are superb. Ramon Vargas as Giasone and the very handsome Alek Shrader as Egeo have both mastered the coloratura, and also manage to sing beautifully despite the awkward physical positions that Neuenfels frequently puts them in.
Alastair Miles is excellent as a hunchbacked( why?) Creon. His singing is first rate . (Sadly, Mayr doesn't give Creon an aria.) He also manages the disinterestedly violent/whimsical characterization that the director has created for him.
One should mention cartoon like dead animals which appear in key scenes. They are a very fake looking swordfish and a cheetah. There is also a seriously limp fake snake that Medea pulls out of a sewer during her great scene in the second act.
Ivor Bolton is the excellent conductor. There are one or two major musical differences between this and earlier CD issues of the work. The overture, for some reason moved about a third of the way into the first act is not the same one on any of the previous recordings. One would like to know more about it, but the only thing that I could locate was hidden in the credits in the little booklet, which says ""Overture orchestrated by Ivor Bolton"" my curiosity is really aroused.
The bonuses, a ""Making Of"" documentary (31 Minutes) and an interview with the president of the Simon Mayr Gesellschaft (17 Minutes) are not particularly interesting. (Nadia Michael seems extremely intelligent though.)
I am recommending this DVD solely because we will almost certainly never have another Mayr opera in the medium.",1323043200,12,4237,4.969014084507042
8477084,5,B005KQ8O3Y,"That production of this opera is superb and revives the music quite grandly. Of course that does not increase the variety of voices that still are three sopranos, fours tenors and one bass, or rather bass-baritone. It does not change the fact that the music is post-Mozart and pre-Verdi, hence it has lost the Mozartian creativity and had not reached yet the Verdian power. But the show is absolutely and flabbergastingly great.

The setting as a two-storied structure is a good materialization of the extremely hierarchical Greek society of the time on any kind of criteria: ethnic, social, or whatever. Greeks were the top provided they were free. The stage director visualizes this fact regularly in the opera. At the very beginning two male slaves fight in front of Creon: one is killed and the other is executed after being crowned the winner. Then three slave women are just put to death on the stage. The Greek society of the time is an extremely blood-thirsty society and all slaves, prisoners or whoever is inferior is the natural target of their desire for blood and killing. They love killing nearly by essence. All along the opera such executions will be staged and realized. Egeo when freed by Medea will take Medea's knife and will kill one after the other his three bodyguards who had been imprisoned along with him.

This realistic and even gross depiction of this ancient society is strong, effective and to the point. Medea is not the only one who kills since all those who are members of the aristocracy can kill the way they want all those who are not, for anything they consider a fault or just for their pleasure. Killing is a game, which makes anyone who is not an aristocrat in this society easy and willy-nilly willing game.

The Women in the Chorus and Creusa are all red-headed which is absolutely surprising and the meaning is not clear since the two Cochians, Medea and Ismene are black-haired with a very light and dark tinge of red. We could have expected that redhaired-ness to be on the Colchian side, but it is even emphasized by the fact the Corinthian women of the chorus appear the second time all with long red gloves. The only meaning I can think of is that the Corinthians are identified as blood-lustful. Then the Colchian are far from that level of bloodthirst.

The choruses, males and females, vary a lot in costumes and identification. They are sailors, fishermen, soldiers, plain people of all sorts, both women and men. They are dressed most of the time in some kind of shade of grey and that brings the royal blue of Creusa, the black of Medea and Creon and the light beige of Jason out. Note in this line of visual signs that the two kids will be a boy and a girl, both around 13 or 14 and the boy will come with a red ball that Medea will have in her hands at the very end as a symbol of the kids, but dead by then.

The action is supplemented by some actors and probably dancers who do the handy work on the stage. But they are used dramatically too. One is an angel, with wings of course, and he will be some kind of Cupid at one time with a lyre and the other one in bright colors is a simple gigolo, or used as such, to mime the bed scene of the wedding, on stage of course, and the girl he mimed it with will be shot dead afterwards. Egeo's three bodyguards have plumed hats and multicolored suits. These extras are making scene shifts and prop-moving easy and they are used as mute dancers now and then.

Nothing is changed as for the action and meaning of the opera as it was composed by Mayr, though some short scenes were cut off between big scenes because they are not useful anymore as transitions. The Corinthians and Jason are depicted as totally untrustworthy: they do not have any faithfulness and do not respect their oaths and promises. Medea is shown as a primitive lady when she comes, wearing a grass-dress and plenty of shells and other decorative objects around her neck and long fake but probably sharp fingers like some female Freddy.

Medea is then a betrayed person, from beginning to end and she will get into an alliance with Egeo later on who was betrayed too, and is in this production quite young. The great number of chorus members and their dramatic use on the stage enables some important scenes to be massive as for their effects. The attempt by Egeo to abduct Creusa and his subsequent arrest is quite active and violent with several people, women and men, killed and displayed on the stage. The symbolic self-emasculation of the angel standing on the table between Medea and Jason when it is clear Jason, after some kind of hesitation, will not be regained by Medea is a marvelous invention but of course it does not make Jason hesitate as for marrying Creusa. The emasculation is for us.

Then the end is unavoidable. The children will have to die and a long scene sets them on the stage with their mother who feeds them, plays with them and yet sings all her suffering because of the task she has to perform.

The only real change of this opera is that the opening symphony (more than 8 minutes) is not performed. The opera starts straight away with the first four scenes. Then a black screen tells us that it is the end of the overture and then ""Das ist der Anfang des Mythos. Wir haben es geschafft. Wir sind mitten im Geschehen."" This is a clear distance-taking attitude about the myth since the producers cannot in any way ignore the total reevaluation Christa Wolf introduced in the myth itself quite a few years before.

And the fact that Egeo is brought onto the stage for the last scene with his gun pointed at Jason's head and Medea coming with the red ball that symbolizes the death of the children, completely dressed in white though she had been wearing a black dress all along after taking her grass-dress off, makes the last words of the opera a lot more powerful than they are by themselves: ""che sanguinoso di!"" Indeed. And there will be no dragon and no escape into the sky. We are promised some more violence int his supposedly democratic and philosophical society.

To conclude we will note that the two-storied stage contraption reminds us of the one used in Wien for the production of Reimann's Medea in 2010, the very same year. And the meaning was the same: a hierarchical society, though it was not shown as blood-thirsty as in this production.

8477085,4,B005KQ8O3Y,"The Medea myth has provided great material for opera composers over the years, and it's not difficult to see why.  It has all the ingredients - as it's played here in this version - for the operatic favourite, the 'melodramma tragico'.  There's a joyous wedding - between Creusa and Jason - but a psycho ex-wife, Medea, who still represents a threat to the union, and a struggle over custody of the kids from her and Jason's previous marriage, which he wants annulled based on the fact that the witch cast a spell over him.  Don't they all.  And would you believe it, the ex turns up at the wedding and causes a bit of a scene.  Nightmare.  For the director of this production of Mayr's 1813 opera Medea in Corinto, Hans Neuenfels, the story is about people living in fear and acting out of fear.  You might not get that quite so much from the original score and libretto, but that at least is the spin put on this production of a rarely performed opera recorded in 2010 at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich.

In Medea in Corinto, the forthcoming union between Creusa and Jason (Giasone in Italian) is a promise to the end of the long wars that have devastated the nation and an end to living in fear.  But right from the beginning, Neuenfel's radical staging puts forward a view that Corinth - perhaps on account of having to deal with the constant threat of violence - has become a corrupt and violent police state, with a cruel and sadistic king, Creon/Creonte.  Much of this interpretation of the myth is, it has to be said, suggested by the staging rather more than anything in the score or the libretto.  In the opening scenes then, while Creon is talking about peace, he and his troops are at the same time engaged in the abuse, torture and execution of ordinary citizens in a sadistic manner that clearly evokes Pasolini's Sal (thankfully without its worst excesses).  In other scenes, either the director doesn't trust the singing to be strong enough or the score to be deep or interesting enough, and includes silent background figures of Hymen and Amor, who play out mimes in the background, as well as solo musicians to highlight and sometimes contrast the actions with the words of the libretto.

Whether it's true to Mayr's vision of the Medea myth, this kind of reworking of the material is of course valid in the context of the nature of the opera's theme of shifting political agendas, where the stated aims of those in power is often contrary to their actions and their actual intent.  More than that however, without a little bit of subversion to enliven it, Medea in Corinto might otherwise be a very dull opera indeed.  Musically, the studied classicism of Mayr's arrangements - stately Mozart-like opera seria without the recitative and singing that is heading towards bel canto - is quite beautiful, but can come across as rather bland, certainly when compared to Cherubini's fiery version, which is an evident model here.  Although the qualities of his composition here are debatable, or at least unfashionable as far as modern opera tastes go, the composer now almost forgotten in the history of opera, Mayr could once count both Bellini and Donizetti as pupils, and Medea in Corinto is consequently not without a considerable amount of interest.

If the Bayerische Staatsoper production then is somewhat radical, it at least tries to make the classical themes relevant to a modern audience, the three-level stage reflecting the three periods through which the audience view this opera - a modern view of Mayr's period interpretation of classical antiquity.  The motivations and intentions however can be a bit dubious in some other respects - Medea first appearing in a witch-doctor costume, Aegeus bizarrely killing his own men in the second act - but it certainly holds the attention better than a more straightforward traditional production might.  The production however also benefits here from some fine singing, Nadja Michael in particular delivering a fabulous rich deep almost mezzo performance as Medea - here as elsewhere a real showpiece role - but the singing all round is of a very high quality.  A slimmed-down Ramn Vargas is notable as Giasone, but the role requires a deeper near-baritone range in some parts that the Mexican tenor can't reach with sufficient force.  Unfashionable it may be, but if you are looking to study the often fascinating intricacies and colour of the score, it's superbly delivered by the Bayerische Staatsorchester under Ivor Bolton, and reproduced brilliantly on the high-quality Blu-ray release.",1318550400,10,4568,4.875968992248062
