8023372,5,B00028498O,"Some friends of mine from Ireland and Scotland bought this for me for my birthday.  It is one of the funniest series I have ever seen.  The ""Glaswegian"" accent/slang of Rab C. may be a little difficult to understand for most Americans but for the most part it is easy to deduce the meaning of the idiomatic expressions.

The main character and his buddies are self proclaimed ""scum"" and proud of it!  Rab has been on the dole all his life and has absolutely no desire to advance beyond his current station.

If you have seen ""Only Fools and Horses"" and liked it you will really enjoy this.  If you haven't seen ""Only Fools and Horses"" you need to get it too!!",1147996800,7,659,4.360655737704918
