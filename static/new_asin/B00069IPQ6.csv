It follows 4 computer warriors (Romm, Gridd, Micron & Scanner) tasked by the computer Parallax to eliminate 4 viruses (Megahurt, Indexx, Null & Minus). During the film the Computer Warriors chase the viruses out of a telecomm port and into the real world. In the real world they adapt and turn regular objects into aircraft, tanks and other useful things.

Its on VHS so not many people will be able to watch it anymore. I watched this film many times along with films like TRON, Black Hole and Star Wars: New Hope (Episode 4).",1299542400,2,653,4.396694214876033
8040654,4,B00069IPQ6,"I remember watching this show when I was really young (between 5 and 7). We lost our original copy, and I forgot what it was called. I had been searching for it off and on and finally stumbled on it. I just had to buy it.
  Watching it again brought back some wonderful memories from when I was young, but I was surprised at how short it is (25-30 minutes?). I suppose as a kid I thought it was longer. Still, it is funny, adventurous, and well worth the few bucks that I paid for it. It's great for kids, and I still enjoy it as an adult.
  Unfortunately, this was the only episode that was made for this cartoon. There was supposed to be a sequel because it leaves everybody hanging at the end. If you have a good enough imagination, I suppose you could make up an ending.",1206230400,2,774,4.14
