I first saw the movie years ago with a friend of mine and have been looking for it ever since. When the price dropped I pounced, thrilled to finally get my hands on my own copy.

Herman has just moved out and found a place of his own, a house with a collection of odd roommates. Something strange is going on there however, clothing keeps disappearing from the wash and headstones keep appearing in the garden...
Can ""Hermie"" get his clothing back, keep tabs on his new girlfriend, and win his battle to the death with - oh wait I don't want to give anything away.

It's a hilarious oddball film that will fit right in to any B movie fan's collection.",1362182400,,659,4.349593495934959

7997112,4,B0000ADXD8,"These guys are really funny.  It's good to see some young people with this kind of creativity and determination.  And boy, these are some youngsters.
The youth does show here and there.  The humor ranges from hysterical to utterly stupid.  But it is always enjoyable.
This is video.  Keep that in mind before purchasing.  These people had no money, as you will see in the documentary.
The real gem here is the short film included in the extras.  Magma Head is really a better movie than Hey Stop Stabbing Me.  I  thought it was extremely clever and well executed, and just funny as hell.  How did these kids get so smart?
Buy this movie if for no other reason than to simply support Miller and friends.  I have a feeling we will see more and better stuff from them in the future.",1084233600,7,779,4.415492957746479
