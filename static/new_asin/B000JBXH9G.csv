2667843,5,B000JBXH9G,"truly a ""SuperFriends"" for  grown ups. A great series with great stories and characters that just happens to be animated",1241222400,,120,5.0
2667844,4,B000JBXH9G,"I actually discovered this series after it was off the air.  A few months back, I started watching Justice Leage: Unlimited re-runs on Cartoon Network's Boomerang channel & I really enjoyed it.  After checking into the DVD's, I found out that JLU is actually a continuation of this series.

The team includes Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern/John Stewart, the Flash/Wally West, & Hawkgirl/Shayera Hol (who is actually an amalgum of the DC characters Hawkgirl/Kendra Saunders & Hawkwoman/Shayera Thal).

Most episodes feature 3-5 League members.  They often team up with other DC heroes including Doctor Fate, Aquaman, Etrigan/Jason Blood, the Blackhawk Squadron, & the Green Lantern Corps.  They often come up against famous villains like the Joker, Gorilla Grodd, Morgan Le Fey, & Star Sapphire.

The animations are great.  The storylines are suitable for children without being ""childish,"" so adults can enjoy it, too.  (I'm a 27 year old woman & I don't have children.)  The voice actors are top notch & really have great chemistry.

The series, itself, deserves 5 stars but this is a review of the DVD's.  I decided to give it 4 stars because I felt that there could have been more included in the special features.  I would especially like to see more information about the characters & the voice artists.

I highly recommend this series.  I also agree that the price is too high & anyone interested should look into buying the sets separately.",1233532800,,1481,5.06198347107438
2667845,3,B000JBXH9G,"I love the series, and I own Justice League Unlimited, but there's no way I'm paying 80 bucks for this.",1207872000,,103,4.2
2667846,2,B000JBXH9G,"As with other DC animated combo packs, this appears to be just the individual box sets of seasons 1 and 2 sold together-but for a much higher price than purchasing them separately?

The individual boxed Justice League seasons currently sell for approximately $25 each (USD).  I have not been able to find any special features listed in the combo pack product description that would justify a $30 increase (from $50 to $80 USD) from the cost of purchasing both seasons separately.

I highly recommend both Justice League and its successor, Justice League Unlimited.  This is a great animated show with better-than-usual writing, casting, and art direction, but I would recommend you save $30 and buy the two seasons separately rather than in this over-priced combo pack.",1206835200,,769,5.079365079365079
2667847,5,B000JBXH9G,"Wish they made more of these Justice League Classic episodes. High quality
animation and good stories.",1199664000,,102,5.4375
2667848,1,B000JBXH9G,I want it but not for $80 I won't be getting this from Amazon.  Great cartoon though.,1192838400,2,85,4.0
2667849,5,B000JBXH9G,"Picking up from where the Superman cartoon left off, the justice league series was definitely an instant classic.

Dan Riba was an amazing director, and Dwayne McDuffie wrote some amazing stories within the world Bruce Timm and Paul Dini created.",1190764800,,246,5.15
2667850,5,B000JBXH9G,"Regarding the price, this is far too expensive. But it's more than worth it if this is your preferred way of ordering DVD sets. JUSTICE LEAGUE and JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED are, hands-down, the BEST animated series to grace the airwaves since the Batman animated series kicked off in 1992. The animation was top-notch, the characterizations and voice work was terrific and the writing of the shows rivaled that of pretty much any live-action genre show (such as LOST or 24). And tragically, due to the fad of anime, JL and JLU's lifespans were cut short by the Cartoon Network and a series that should have lasted many more seasons than something like DRAGONBALL Z only lasted 3 and 1/2 seasons. If you're a fan of the DC universe, of comic books, of cartoons, or just of great storytelling in general, do yourself a favor and get immersed in JUSTICE LEAGUE.",1181260800,4,857,4.72
2667851,3,B000JBXH9G,"I really love the Justice League cartoon.  It retained much of the character and charm of Batman: The Animated Series, while exposing viewers to a wider array of stories and personalities. I recommend the series to anyone who like heroes and comics.  It's good for kids from early teen years on up.

Unfortunately this 2-pack of DVDs is a bit of a bad deal.  At the time I'm writing this it is priced at $80.99, a full $15 or so more than the 2 season sets individually. Why it is priced that high I have no idea.

Do yourself a favor and check out those individual sets first to see which is the better deal, OK?

If you like them the 2 seasons of the follow-up series Justice League: Unlimited are available in a set at a much more reasonable price of $45.99, as of this writing, too.

It is the most well-written and acted DC animation ever. I assure you that if it were brought back, the ratings would be amazing! Please consider!",1501200000,,283,4.568627450980392

8149598,5,B000JBXH9G,"This has to be the best series out.  I thoroughly enjoyed the series.  I love how every episode builds on the next.  I had purchased Season 1 and 2 of Justice League Unlimited and while unessary, now watching Season 1 & 2 of Justice League makes JL Unlimited make more sense.  The stories are very will thought out and compelling.  I would definitely advise purchasing this series as well as JL Unlimited.  I know that they now have the complete series available so that I would purchase that.",1260835200,,493,4.545454545454546
8149599,5,B000JBXH9G,This series is one of the best animated series ever.  I was a fan of Batman the animated series and this carries on the tradition with explosive stories and wonderful animation.  I was always a marvel fan growing up but DC animated knows how to make fantastic stories that captivate the viewer.  The guess voice actors are fun to identify.  Overall if you are a fan of any characters in the DC universe this is a must have set.,1244332800,,427,4.367088607594937
