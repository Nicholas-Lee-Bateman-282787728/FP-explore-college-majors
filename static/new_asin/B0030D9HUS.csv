8385789,3,B0030D9HUS,"3 stars for OK quality.  I bought adventures Wild bill Hickok serial (Gozillaflix) off of ebay years ago for $10. This is picture is cropped appear to give the impression of film but it is from tape. Moreover comparing it to the hermitage hill segment on you tube that it is also missing details (left side and bottom), which is evident that it is not a new film transfer. Same type of video skips appear in this like other serials from Gray market dealers. Red circle has a slightly better copy than the Gozillaflix according to a reviewer. Serialsquadron has a new transfer from film for @$5 more.",1462320000,,599,4.546296296296297
8385790,4,B0030D9HUS,"I remembered seeing this as a kid at the Saturday matinee (and that was a LONG time ago) and wanted to renew some memories. I found this serial to be very enjoyable and it is now a part of my very large collection of `B' movie westerns of the 30's, 40's, and early 50's.",1457740800,,270,4.018518518518518

8385792,4,B0030D9HUS,"Get those bad guys!!! US Marshal Hickok can do anything Superman can...his flying may be jumping off of his horse onto the stagecoach, but nevertheless, he is a true hero.  The story is true as well, but the fun is watching all those running horses, the herds of cattle with the covered wagons, and heroes winning the day for now.  Fun to see what real stuntmen did instead of CGI.  But the reason I bought this was because my mother was the nurse on set while all of the segments were filmed.  I had hoped for credits at the end, but they were cut--if they ever existed.  Yet, I grew up with autographed photos and stories of where the cameras were and how the sets were done.  So for me, this was a quest for personal history, but for anyone wanting to see how wonderful movie making was in the early years, try this DVD.  Damages show from the original film but that is to be expected and doesn't interfere with the excitement of real Texas and US Marshal Wild Bill Hickok!",1429833600,4,976,4.329670329670329
8385793,4,B0030D9HUS,"""The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok"" was Columbia's fourth serial, produced by Jack Fier and Harry S. Webb, directed by Sam Nelson and Mack V. Wright, and released in 1938.  Not only was it a big success for Columbia, it put Gordon Elliott in starring roles, with his name changed to Bill Elliott, William Elliott or Wild Bill Elliott.

The story starts in Texas, shortly after the Civil War, where a group of men known as the Phantom Raiders, headed by Morrell (Robert Fiske) is trying to swindle ranchers out of their land by preventing them from moving their cattle to market through Abilene, Kansas.  The ranchers, headed by Cameron (Monte Blue) confront their money lender, and one of the chief members of the Phantom Raiders, Stone (Eddy Waller), who insists on payment before the cattle are moved, and has bought a judge to back him up.  This doesn't work, and soon the Phantom Raiders plan more direct measures to stop the ranchers, and also try to prevent construction of the railroad to Abilene.  And in Abilene, the Phantoms have again held up the stagecoach, and ride defiantly through town.  One of their members gets shot, so they send four men back to take revenge.  Meanwhile, Wild Bill Hickok (Gordon Elliott) has arrived as the new U.S. Marshal in Abilene, saying ""I'm a peaceable man"" and spoils the Raiders' plans.  But the Phantom Raiders make many other attacks on the ranchers, the railroad and on Wild Bill Hickok.

There are the expected characters, such as Cameron's daughter Ruth (Carole Wayne), helpers Jim Blakely and Kit Lawson (Reed Hadley and Kermit Maynard) with numerous brief appearances of well-known bad-guy actors including Richard Cramer, Frank Lackteen, Edmund Cobb, Al Bridge, George Chesebro and Tom London.  A bunch of kids make up the ""Flaming Arrows"" who wear special Wild Bill Hickok badges and use ""Our Country"" as a password.  Three of them get screen credit: Frankie Darro, Dickie Jones and Sammy McKim as Little Jerry, Buddy and Boots, respectively.  It's a mystery how Hickok manages to outdraw his opponents with his umpteen-shooters holstered backwards, but it was something that set Elliott apart.  And the serial is far more entertaining than what Universal had in their westerns, even if the famous clip of the Indian being shot off his horse is also used here.  Occasional humor is provided, mostly from bartender Oscar ""Snake Eyes"" Smith and his cohort, printer Danny (Rosco Ates and Monte Collins) but unlike later Columbia serials it is limited to specific scenes.  Musical director Abe Meyer provided a stirring score, but like other elements in serial movies, leaving a day or more between chapters helps keep it from seeming redundant.

Gozillaflix' edition is issued on two ""burned"" DVD-R discs, the source being from a reissue, the cast list updated with ""William Elliott"" instead of ""Gordon Elliott"" in the title role and the background picture lacking the motion seen in the rest of the credits.  While claimed to be ""digitally remastered"" this probably means they transferred it to DVD, though with some kind of editing on a digital system, which might explain the infrequent but noticeable pauses in the action.  Don't expect a wonderful transfer; the image is not very sharp, to the extent that the MPPDA certificate numbers are indistinct in some chapter titles, and they aren't all that small.  Emulsion damage is seen at the start of a few of the chapters, periodic missing segments about half a second long mostly on the left side of the screen, which also takes out small pieces of the sound.  While this is usually limited to the opening credits it affects the entire first reel, about 10 minutes, of Chapter One.  But despite these issues the image has fairly good gray scale, is reasonably free of dirt and scratches, and there aren't many splices.  A copyright notice is added to the opening credits, and Gozillaflix puts their logo on-screen for a few seconds about twice per chapter, far less of an annoyance if the color is turned off.  This is a good idea anyhow since there is a slight amount of spurious color noise.  The sound is generally good, clear enough if occasionally with a little low-frequency distortion, and unlike many old prints of Columbia serials this one seems to be fairly complete, including the ""next week"" teasers and final ""Columbia"" logo, which on most chapters make it all the way to the final shouts of ""Wild Bill Hickok.""  Of bypassable concern, there is a very loud advertisement for Gozillaflix products at the start of the first chapter on each disc, running about 50 seconds.  Keep the sound muted until the opening ""Columbia"" logo appears.

For those wanting pristine copies with razor-sharp images this relase won't do, but it is better than many ""unrestored"" prints of 'B' westerns.  It is enjoyable, in small doses, and given its place in film history, both to Columbia's serials and Gordon Elliott's career, it is good to have the serial available on DVD.",1310688000,12,4981,4.911694510739856
