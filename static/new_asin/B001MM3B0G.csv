8321485,5,B001MM3B0G,this is what the museum in Washington D.C. recommended to watch. it is so interesting to learn about those famous seamen,1387152000,,120,4.761904761904762
8321486,4,B001MM3B0G,I was a diver for Maritime Explorations and helped find and recover the Whydah. It brouhgback lots of good memories.,1376092800,2,116,4.85
8321487,5,B001MM3B0G,"National Geographic has yet another well-made documentary on it's hands!!!  I loved the lengths that these people went in order to show how history was made for not just the pirate, but his ship as well!!!  Very fascinating!!!",1369699200,,226,4.921052631578948
8321488,2,B001MM3B0G,"This is the very shortened version of a wonderful program! I originally saw this on tv, and with commercials, it was 2 hours long. There was soooooo much more of the actual pirates' code but it is missing from this dvd. It's more about the recovery efforts and far less about the actual pirates. Not worth any money, really.",1298851200,12,324,4.508474576271187
8321489,5,B001MM3B0G,"A very nice film although rather short, as most National Geographic films are. They did a fairly nice and through job telling the story of the Whydah and Captain Bellamy (Black Sam) however the 'extras' is not very 'extra' at all. They had such a chance (and so many relics now) that they Could Have made an entire 'Behind the Scenes' preview to compliment the current artifact show they now have circulating the museums, why they chose to cut all that out and only show a few pans of the camera of the actual artifacts they have recovered I have no idea...but then again it is 'National Geo' and not a true ""Pirate Film"" by a masterful story teller.

But for the wonderful reenactment scenes they did put into it and for the wonderful accurate information offered (however IMO they rather skimped on) I still give it 5 stars and worth adding to any pirate enthusiast's collection. Like most National Geographic DVDs it is nothing more then a ""short"" flick, something to watch after dinner and before 'The Big Show'. Hopefully once they get to the lower deck a real film maker will join with salvage expert Barry Clifford and bring us a through look into this magnificent ship and the secrets she has relieved of the men who sailed her; and tell what has been found of the crew that we also now have information on - after all, Black Sam did not sail her alone!
