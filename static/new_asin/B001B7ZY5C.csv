8282175,4,B001B7ZY5C,"An american Black Metal band with euro old-school sound is a rare find and this one is one of those; lots of tremolo picking and brutal sound with dual-guitar attack and yelled vocals high in the mix a l Dark Funeral, massive dual kick-drum sound, great mix and a 4-camera sharp pic with 4:3 old-school filming .

The dvd is chock-full of features, with a 41' main concert. The musicianship is superb and the guys are dressed up in plain black with band T-shirts and no corpse paint, wielding stunning black and white BC Rich Warlocks.

The extras are a half hour tv appearance by an older incarnation of the band with a different lineup with keyboards, 4 incredibly good videoclips, a picture gallery, discography and whatnot.
