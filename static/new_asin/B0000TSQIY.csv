8002791,2,B0000TSQIY,"This film was highly remembered in the Somos Survey of 100 Great Mexican Films but it really didn't merit the accolades.  It looks like it was filmed on a cheap budget supplied by the US Border Patrol as some type of propaganda to persuade the Mexican masses against trying to find a better life ""al otro lado"".  Some of the dialogue in English is so politically incorrect that it had me laughing out loud.  But the film was trying to be serious and that just made me laugh more.  David Silva was in a number of films that are remembered well but look really bad today (like Campeon Sin Corona).  I am sure he was a nice man but he just lacked the charisma to be a romantic lead actor.  His chubby gut and declining hairline would have made for a much better character actor; I am sure he could have done great things as an alcoholic uncle or under performing army sergeant. Even as a villain he probably wouldn't have been very convincing as he looked too lazy to instigate any significant threat.  The cheapish production values and silly script of Espaldas Mojadas don't do him any favors here.  Rent it so you'll know for yourself but this isn't really worth a spot on your shelf.",1261180800,,1184,4.423963133640553
