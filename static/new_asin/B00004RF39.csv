1342264,3,B00004RF39,"I really don't care for this type of story line even though I watched it.  Too shallow!!!
Grant it, it was filmed in the eighties.  Way to impossible.",1361145600,,150,4.321428571428571
1342265,5,B00004RF39,"I love Debra Kerr .in Hold that dream. B T Bradford is a great  novelist. I saw this years ago, it is timeless.",1360454400,,111,3.8260869565217392
1342266,4,B00004RF39,This was the movies made after the Woman of Substances and they did a great job.  I like older movies.,1359936000,,102,4.1
1342267,3,B00004RF39,"The first part of the saga was much better.  I only watched this one to finish the story, but overall it lacked depth and was just a soap.",1358121600,,138,3.9285714285714284
1342268,2,B00004RF39,"Not as good as part one. The first part is interesting, but the acting of all except the main character in part two is lacking.",1352592000,,127,4.12
1342269,5,B00004RF39,If you are an eighties survivor you remember television mini-series.  This is one of the better mini-series with good actors/actresses and a very interesting story line.  Like a lot of television from this era there are morals in the storyline.  This is good television.,1290211200,,270,5.090909090909091
1342270,4,B00004RF39,"Hold The Dream is the story of Emma Harte's granddaughter and heir, Paula, and the way she tries to juggle business and her family. I started to say it's like a soap opera because of the suspense and backstabbing going on, but it's better than a soap because there is some conclusion. I would suggest buying A Woman Of Substance, too and looking at it first. It's set in the early 1900's and gives a background on Emma Harte. You'll understand Hold The Dream better. I love these movies. They are not boring, but are filled with excitement, intrigue and all the good and bad that make up this family. They don't make mini-series like this anymore. What a pity!",1214956800,,660,4.508333333333334
1342271,3,B00004RF39,"While no where near as good as ""A Woman of Substance"" it is still worth watching. If you fell in love with Emma Harte how can you not watch the second part of the story? The best character of the movie is of course Jenny Seagrove. I'd love that they cast er as the star in this one too. Why have I never seen her star in another movie? She is just excellent as in ""Substance."" Stephen Collins is a great lead but the chemistry is pretty low between them. The worst part of the entire story is Paula marrying a Fairley? I honestly couldn't stomach that one after seeing them try to ruin Emma a generation before. The best part? Emma & Blackey O""Neill FINALLY declare their love.",1010793600,7,677,4.255813953488372
1342272,5,B00004RF39,Hold the Dream is a second part of a series.  It is based on a family which came from poor to powerful.  The Series is one of the best I've seen.  It will build self esteem and make you aware of others who have to struggle each day.  It will help you to learn to endure.,1007856000,2,270,3.767857142857143
1342273,5,B00004RF39,"As with ""A Woman of Substance"" this movie carries on with Emma Harte's granddaughter Paula who is charged to hold Emma's dream. True to  her previous movie this story stuck very close to the book. I love this  story and I can't wait to watch the third one ""To Be The Best"".  Watch and love!",967507200,9,290,4.236363636363636
1342361,3,B00004RF39,"Fair-to-middling follow-on to the far superior ""Woman of Substance."" Give it a go if you'd like to see Jenny Seagrove play Emma Harte's granddaughter after playing Emma herself.",1442966400,,177,5.357142857142857

1342368,5,B00004RF39,"Love this movie and the one before it.  The acting was super and you actually felt like you were living the live right along side them.  It was sad when it was over, but sure enjoyed both movies.",1408924800,,195,4.105263157894737

1342399,5,B00004RF39,"Also saw ""Woman of substance"" which is a good follow up. Reflects the tines in England well allowing for the characterless to have their own plot.",1404432000,,146,4.653846153846154

1342403,5,B00004RF39,I saw the first season of this story and just had to have the next season and am loving watching it.  From rags to riches story which leaves you happy and sad all at the same time.,1385424000,,180,3.864864864864865
1342404,1,B00004RF39,"Compared to the first trilogy..this is terrible. The only thing good about the series is the clothing, which was absolutely fabulous. Do not waste your money buying this..I watched both out of curiosity. And this time I am going to take the advice of the reviews for the last part of the trilogy that Lindsey Wagner is in..I do not intend to buy it..you should not buy this either..unless it is free then watch it..what will you have to loose? I am sure you will enjoy the fashions also.",1384128000,,487,4.48314606741573
1342405,3,B00004RF39,"This is part two of an eighties mini-series. It's kind of cheesy, but kind of fun as well. I don't recommend it for children.",1379462400,,125,4.25
1342406,3,B00004RF39,Enjoyed this period piece with intrigue and romance.  The places where it was filmed were so lovely and the characters believable over time.,1378252800,,140,5.086956521739131
1342407,5,B00004RF39,"Almost as good as the book......I could watch it over and over again.  Someone should,take the entire series of books and make an updated series.",1378252800,,145,4.8

acting saves the show.  I'd like to see more choices in Amazon instant .....",1377907200,,135,5.136363636363637

1342442,5,B00004RF39,"Simply love this movie...Great acting, good plot....nice romance  A good relaxing story of one woman determined to beat her station in life and rise above in a time when women did not do business as she did....great movie.",1377734400,,222,4.842105263157895
1342443,5,B00004RF39,"Strong woman leading role. Surprised, I thought I would hate the 80s theme, but really liked it. Watched it twice.",1377734400,,114,4.75
1342444,1,B00004RF39,"I was confused by this entire film because of a lack of cohesiveness in relation to the first film.  No explanation as to who was who, how the relationships evolved to the present day.  I was waiting to understand what happened to the main character after she found herself rejected and pregnant.  How did she become a wealthy business owner?  And what happened to the two sons (?) who were trying to do her in in the first film?  No mention of them in the sequel.  Poor continuity.",1376524800,,482,4.420454545454546
1342445,5,B00004RF39,I loved the ongoing story of a woman who started as a servant and ended as a very wealthy woman,1376352000,,95,3.8
1342446,3,B00004RF39,This movie is a good ending to the whole saga and without it the one would wonder what happened and how the story ended.,1376092800,,120,4.041666666666667
1342447,5,B00004RF39,I read the complete series by Barbara Taylor Bradford about Emma Harte.  This is the second in the series.  The movie follows the story very well and Jenny Seagrove was quite good in the starring role.,1375142400,,201,4.555555555555555
1342448,4,B00004RF39,"This was a good movie, but I don't particularly like movies with the business woman. She is victorious in the end and it was entertaining.",1375056000,,138,4.56
1342449,4,B00004RF39,It was a great movie... her live captured for the most part. I will recommend this to any viewer without any hesitation...,1373760000,,122,4.590909090909091
1342450,3,B00004RF39,"Not as good as the first (A Woman of Substance). Still full of deceit, treachery, pain, heartache and sexual immorality; everything that man thinks it takes to make a great movie.",1373328000,,179,4.806451612903226
1342471,5,B00004RF39,"I read the book. Most movies are not as good as the book, but I thought this was good. I love the British movies. Keep them coming.",1373241600,,131,3.888888888888889
1342472,4,B00004RF39,"Good story - a follow on to the Woman of Substance series - acting not suberb - showing its age a bit, but worth watching.",1373155200,,122,3.92
1342473,4,B00004RF39,"BTB's stuff is always good.  I was initially attracted to the story because I worked in the retail department store world at one time.
BTB's work was very accurate in portraying upper management.",1372550400,,195,4.909090909090909
1342474,4,B00004RF39,"Considering the age of the movie the quality was pretty good and the movie itself was pure soap opera entertainment.  As sometimes happens with sequels, it seemed to lack the ability to hold my attention compared to ""Woman of Substance"".",1371686400,,237,4.925
1342475,5,B00004RF39,I liked the story. Deborah Kerr and Jenny Seagrove were great in it. The landscape shots were beautiful! It was easy to watch and believable.,1370908800,,141,4.68
1342476,4,B00004RF39,"this was good I loved the Woman of Substance much better,  but Hold the Dream was good, The story continues!",1370476800,,108,4.4
1342477,2,B00004RF39,"i LOVE ""a woman of substance"", the first production in this series with beautiful jenny seagrove playing emma hart. she inhabits the character so thoroughly you don't feel she is acting, but living.

however, the acting and storyline in this later production taking place in the ""present day"" (1986) are lackluster and tired.  and most unfortunately, having jenny seagrove also play emma hart's granddaughter paula is disorienting.  :(",1370390400,,435,5.367647058823529
1342478,2,B00004RF39,Read the books ; this needs to be updated into a current movie that doesn't look like it was made in the age of silent movies,1369785600,,125,3.8461538461538463
1342479,4,B00004RF39,it was good for the time period it was shot in the female roles were vert strong characters which i like,1369440000,,104,4.0
1342480,2,B00004RF39,Not fun old just funky old.  Poor quality footage.  Not an engaging story line.  Not captivating.  Really quite boring.  I could not watch it.,1369440000,,142,4.75
1342511,3,B00004RF39,"Unlike the first in BTB's series, this production fails to dig into the characters with any depth. It was more like a visual Cliff's Notes version of the story instead of a feature film.",1369180800,,186,4.5
1342512,4,B00004RF39,Read the books ever so long ago.............was good to revisit the series.....eight more words required....hmmm....let me see...think that is it,1368576000,,145,6.3
1342513,5,B00004RF39,"I ""listed"" to the 6 cd book woman of substance on a long solo road trip - this movie brought the story back and the facial expression of body language of the actors added to the story;  Will watch it again.",1368316800,,206,4.024390243902439

1342515,5,B00004RF39,you cant go wrong with barbra  taylor shows that women were strong then too. plus now i have the time and my kindle so i can catch up on the things i missed working,1367107200,,164,3.823529411764706
1342516,5,B00004RF39,"I have always loved this series of Woman of Substance, Hold the Dream and To be the Best, I even read the books a couple
of times before I saw movies and have watched them a number of times.  I wish there were more movies made of Barbara
Taylor Bradford's books.",1367107200,,262,4.137254901960785
1342517,3,B00004RF39,This one was okay. I was intrigued by Jenny Seagrove playing a relative of the main character this time. I thought this was very creative. I didn't love it as much as A Woman of Substance but it was entertaining and carried the continuance of the story.,1366416000,,253,4.404255319148936
1342518,5,B00004RF39,Good story line. Good acting. Jennie Seagrove was excellent. Character casting was good. I certainly would recommend watching this movie. My all time favorite Deborah Kerr was very good as well.,1365465600,,194,5.290322580645161
1342519,3,B00004RF39,"Somewhere between the two productions of this and the Woman of Substance, Emma became a ""woman of unsubstance.""  I read the trilogy years (and years!) ago, and the adaptation for Hold the Dream was mostly faithful to the book. The book, however, portrayed Emma as more accessible and less implacable. Emma seemed brittle and inclement in this film. If you liked the Woman of Substance film,read Hold the Dream instead of watching this adaptation. While the book and film showed Emma was very much intent on continuing to build her empire, the movie failed to encapsulate Emma's vunerability, but rather she came off shrewish and implacable.  In my opinion, she was like an automaton as she didn't seem empathetic to anyone.

She didn't really bond with her children as they were growing up and this movie made the children seem as props to be taken out when necessary, and then put away once she no longer needed them.  She seemed to grow more inflexible as time marched on.  This isn't a bad film, but Emma was not a sympathetic character.
If, in the movie, she would have stepped down from her high horse occasionally, I might have been able to identify 'with her.  As it stands, in this film, Emma is no longer a woman of substance.",1365379200,,1235,4.668202764976958
1342520,5,B00004RF39,I am glad that you offer recommendations.  I love this author's series.  I didn't know about the movies until is was one of your recommendations.  Thanks,1365033600,,153,4.8076923076923075

1342542,5,B00004RF39,"Great Movie !
This was a good series all the way through. I love movies that Start with years past and bring you to the present or close to the present. I recommend this movie 100% but only if you start at the beginning.",1364601600,,220,4.0227272727272725
1342543,3,B00004RF39,Jenny Seagrove was terrific as was Deborah Kerr but some of the others were less enthralling. Still well worth watching.,1364515200,,120,5.05
1342544,1,B00004RF39,"I guess I had a moment of DUH when I bought it because I didn't really like the previous part of this story.  I thought the production value was lacking and then, to have the same woman play the grandaughter?  Really?  LAME.

It was a very bad purchase and I wish I could 'return' it.",1364083200,,284,4.109090909090909

1342548,5,B00004RF39,"Unlike current movies, there is no vulgar language. This was obviously an expensive production that was well acted. The material was mature since there were a number of affairs.",1362182400,,177,5.137931034482759
