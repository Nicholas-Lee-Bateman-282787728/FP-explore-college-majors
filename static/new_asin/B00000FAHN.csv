1206969,5,B00000FAHN,"Next to the Doric temple the structure that most ineffably captures the concept of ""purity"" is the Gothic cathedral .With their soaring spires and flying buttresses these Gothic marvels incarnate the eternal human yearning for the infinite and the undefinable .This video walks you through the layout of a Gothic cathedral : nave , transept, altar,chapels , the crypt etc. Most of these cathedrals were erected in the late 12th to mid 13th century AD (Chartres c. 1194-1221 AD , Rheims c. 1209-1290 AD, Amiens c. 1219-1269 AD , Bourges c. 1195-1255 AD, Notre Dame c. 1152-1240 AD  & Laon 1153-1223 AD ). To me these cathedrals represent the first stirrings of creative energy in medieval Europe after being shrouded in the Dark Ages for more than 700 years . This same energy and  love of learning and adventure spills over into  the Crusades and culminates in the Rennaissance .Finally I must mention the animations in this video which liven up some of the human interest stories that went into the construction of these cathedrals : they are cute but a bit overdone . I would have much preferred it if the narrators had spent the extra time going over the finer details of the statuary & architecture at these masterpieces i.e. the aristocratic figures that face the west portal at Chartres .",976406400,30,1294,4.79372197309417
1207046,5,B00000FAHN,"When I was a high school history teacher one of the highlights of the year was always the day or so I set aside for David Macaulay's Cathedral.  A depiction of the construction of an imaginary Gothic Cathedral in 13th century Northern France, this is one of the most beautiful films PBS has ever made available for educational use, which is high praise indeed.

David Macaulay's genius lies in his ability, both in words and highly detailed drawings, to clearly explain the process of building highly complex structures like cathedrals.  Accompanying that ability in Cathedral is a beautiful and dramatic story: the tale of Pierre, who chronicles the construction of the cathedral over the course of his long life, witnessing the coming and going of church officials and kings while the cathedral's towers rise slowly.  Pierre's story is told in beautifully drawn animation. Accompanying the animated sequences are some unforgettable segments in which Macaulay shows us around some Gothic cathedrals, explains their construction, and analyzes the symbolism in the stained glass, gargoyles, and statuary to be found in them.  The live action and animation blend together perfectly, assisted by beautiful and soaring music.

It can be difficult to hold students' attention when showing a film, but I never had that problem with Cathedral or with any of Macaulay's other productions.",1381622400,2,1380,5.25
1207047,5,B00000FAHN,"I use this documentary to teach a unit on Gothic Cathedrals in my Western Civilization course and along with the text, students often comment about how good ""Cathedral"" is as it helps them visualize the process of building these magnificent houses of worship.

1207050,5,B00000FAHN,"My son, now an architect, watched this video endlessly as a 4 year old.  He used it extensively for a junior high project as well.  It contains anything and everything you need to understand the aesthetics, physics, structure, construction and function of a medieval cathedral.  It even covers some of the theology of colored light through the windows.  I wouldn't hesitate to show it to an intro college class either - it is that complete.  Excellent for lighting a fire under young erstwhile architects and architectural historians.  I am ordering a DVD copy, since our old VCR bit the dust and I only have a VHS tape.  Have used this in a Sunday School class as well.  Highly recommended.",1367280000,2,691,4.7478991596638656

1207053,5,B00000FAHN,"Anyone as fascinated with cathdrals as I am will find this video very engaging.  Hosted by David Macaulay, It is an extension of his book ""Cathedral"" (which captured my attention many years ago) and is enriched with an abundance of historical context (starting in 1214 with the design of a prototypical, albeit fictional, Gothic cathedral in France).  The video has won numerous awards, and it's easy to see why.  Mr. Macaulday has an extraordinary talent for explaining (in a series of books) how humans have managed to build utterly challenging structures (not only cathdrals, but pyramids and castles as well).",1360022400,,613,5.11
1207054,5,B00000FAHN,"I cannot even count the number of times I watched this.  It is based on the book by the same name, but the marriage of animation, storyline and it's teaching of the Gothic Structures are amazing.  A very short video, but gives you a sense of the work that went into each cathedral.  I'll probably continue watching it because I never tire of it.

My only grunt on this seems to be the transfer of the original to DVD.  It looks as though it was recorded from a projection and not a very good scan.  Perhaps they did not have the original film and this was a 2nd generation copy of video tape.  Still, it is a wonderful production.  Recommend it highly.",1354752000,,652,4.286885245901639

1207098,5,B00000FAHN,"It's hard to envision a Gothic cathedral being built -- they are such soaring, exalted, complex buildings that they almost seem unreal.

""Cathedral (1985) [Hosted by David Macaulay]"" takes away some of cathedrals' mystery, but it also does a great job explaining the structure, origins and culture behind them. And it's paired with a solid animated story describing a medieval cathedral being brought into existence, despite the odds stacked against it ever being finished.

Half of the movie is devoted to David Macaulay touring through cathedrals, and talking about the way they were built, and the world that they were built in. So in other words, if you don't know what flying buttresses are for or how the weight is distributed, Macaulay will explain it to you. We're also told about the place of a cathedral in medieval cities, the artwork included both inside and outside, and even the tools that were required to construct it.

It's a good way to learn the basics, especially since small animated depictions of what happened are included for some of the more complex parts of the cathedral. It's laid out in clear, well-spoken language that manages to convey its points without getting bogged down in jargon.

There is also a fictional narrative that pops up between mini-lectures. It tells the story of a French town whose Notre Dame de Beaulieu is destroyed in a spectacular fire, and the only consolation is that a young monk is able to save a veil that supposedly belonged to the Blessed Virgin. He records the beginnings of construction on a new, bigger, seemingly impossible cathedral with ""heavy stone ceilings, walls of glass.""

But then the local bishop dies, and a new, corrupt bishop insists on using rotten stone from his family's own quarries while pocketing money for himself. Soon a disaster strikes in the half-built cathedral, and the town is facing bankruptcy... and it will take a literal miracle to help them.

The cartoon portion is what really keeps this show from being boring -- it's a compelling, low-key narrative with nicely realistic animation and some solid voice acting from Derek Jacobi and Brian Blessed. It also stops occasionally to have the characters explain to each other (usually to the monks chronicling its creation) the details of its making, such as the vaulted ceilings or how they cast church bells.

It also has a stark feeling of realism, such as the decades that pass before the cathedral is actually finished. Several of the characters actually die -- by old age and accident -- before the story ends. But it also captures the fierce piety of medieval life, as well as the soaring spiritual uplift created by the cathedrals themselves.

""Cathedral"" is an excellent homage to Gothic architecture, and a great way to find out just how these complex structures were created. Everything I know about cathedrals I learned from David Macaulay!",1304380800,5,2893,4.962809917355372
1207099,5,B00000FAHN,"As one who lives in the woods and prays to trees, I could not help but be awed by the mastery of this production. Truly this film should have received an Oscar for the sheer cajones displayed by the director. To kill the narrator part way through the film?

1207101,5,B00000FAHN,"I watched ""Cathedral"" as a young boy and was in awe of history and the majestic Gothic cathedrals, and how they were built as well.

Although this documentary is from 1985, it is in no way outdated. The animation helps to make history accessible to younger viewers, and helps to reinforce it for adults.

Macaulay and Caroline Berg also do a great job in presenting Gothic cathedrals plus the histories of France and Christianity to life. They are on-site for the whole documentary, instead of being interviewed in a room. Their dialouge isn't dumbed down, but also devoid of mindless intellectual jargon. I have to add that music is also pretty cool, too.

Buy this for youself, your students, or for your children, especially if you would like them to see what a truly amazing church can be.

Now, whatever became of the lovely Caroline Berg...",1248393600,3,846,4.773972602739726
1207102,3,B00000FAHN,"The one narrow type of French Gothic cathedrals that is the subject of this video were constructed by Catholic cities mostly where bishops resided in or near France. The flying buttress that allowed the height and
stained glass windows is discussed as well as the hardships the constructions forced on the economics of these cities.
The narrow time period if about 1100-1300 ad while the catholic Church and
feudal Europe ruled. In the middle ages other types of cathedrals
were being constructed and even in other religions.
The architectural ignorance of the builders sort of added to the  building style? This video is somewhat better than the one called Castle,
but both are much too narrow in approach for my liking.",1246924800,6,721,4.958677685950414
1207103,5,B00000FAHN,Outstanding! I have been using this video for years in my math classes. I wore one copy out and ordered another. It has animation mixed in so it keeps the students' interest. I learned a lot about the politics and architecture of the middle ages.,1237939200,5,246,4.488888888888889
1207104,4,B00000FAHN,"Some background information first, to place my review in context. I have studied medieval history, have conducted surveys of medieval churches, and have even written about aspects of medieval history of my home town. So I approached this DVD with some trepidation and curiosity.

This 60-minute DVD commences with an animated sequence showing the imaginary old cathedral of Notre Dame de Beaulieu in northern France being destroyed by fire in the year 1214. `Oh dear', I thought, what have I let myself in for? But I had no need to worry. This is a marvellous production, with all the learning and integrity that PBS brings to its documentaries.

The programme focuses on the cathedrals of northern France - Chartres, Reims, Amiens, Bourges, Paris, Laon and Rennes all appear - and is presented by David Macaulay and Caroline Berg. (They are good, but have an annoying habit of addressing each other rather than the viewer.) They explain how the new Gothic style was distinguished by its greater height, its stone vaults and its walls of glass. They also quote and visit Abbot Suger's visionary works at the abbey of Saint-Denis, just north of Paris (although more recent academic work - this DVD was made in 1985 - has shown that postulated that Suger was really more of a traditionalist).

There are good graphic explanations on-screen of these changes in architecture and their effects, of how walls of glass, for example, had to be supported by piers of greater solidity, to compensate for the now-missing stone. The problem of the subsequent lack of internal volume that this entailed was solved by transferring the support away from the internal piers, which could now be more slender, outside through flying buttresses. The pinnacles on top of these are not there for purely decorative purposes, but also add weight and solidity to the structure.

Meanwhile, the interspersed animated sequences are extensive and continue throughout the programme, giving a good idea of the religious, financial, economic and social background to the construction of such mighty cathedrals. (The voices will be familiar, as they include such luminaries as Derek Jacobi and Brian Blessed.) The role of relics and pilgrimages is considered, as well as where the stone and timber came from to build these medieval skyscrapers, how the work paid for, and how it was organised. Details of how stained glass and tracery in rose windows are covered, as are the types of new sculpture supplied, how the roofs were erected and the stone vaulting was set, and the bells cast. The DVD also highlights the necessary economy in the use of stone.

As cathedrals competed to go higher and higher, there was bound to be a disaster waiting to happen. The collapse of the 150-foot high nave at Beauvais is shown in an aerial shot. Indeed, the aerial shots of the other cathedrals are excellent too, if a little short in length on screen. (But, hey, that's what's the pause button's for!)

Overall, I was very impressed with this DVD, which more than met my expectations. Much was already known, but much also was new to me, for example how the stone vaults were put in place. This programme makes a serious attempt at entering the medieval mindset in which religion and the church took centre-stage. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the medieval period of western civilisation or with an interest in gothic art and architecture.",1200787200,15,3418,4.935652173913043
1207105,5,B00000FAHN,I love this DVD--the cartoon accompanied with the on location art history lesson about Medieval architecture is wonderful.  It was just something I felt I should own.,1199664000,2,166,5.148148148148148
1207106,5,B00000FAHN,"As I've seen with other David Macaulay books brought to the small screen---Castle, Pyramid, Roman Town---Cathedral, another childhood favorite of mine, encapsulates a certain joyful magic as it brings its fact-filled story to life. Telling of the construction of a great Gothic cathedral in France during the high point of the era of faith, Cathedral interspaces live action shots set at Chartres and other notable Medieval sites, with affectionately drawn animation that lets us become eyewitnesses to the creation of a monumental work of architecture. Hosted by the author himself and narrated by Derek Jacobi, Cathedral is a rare delight.",1194566400,3,641,5.42
1207107,5,B00000FAHN,This is still one of the best ways to understand the spirit of the cathedral age. I loved watching it as a child and was very happy to be able to buy it for my son. The cartoon style is similar to the original Hobbit movie and allows a dramatic description of the inner workings of a cathedral. Every age group will learn something and I highly recommend it for people planning a trip to Western Europe because it gives you a better appreciation for what you see.,1184716800,2,463,4.2727272727272725
1207196,5,B00000FAHN,"This film is great for two reasons. Firstly, it is a very detailed account of the purpose and development of the cathedral based around the account of a fictional cathedral construction project complete with a very dated (but wonderful) cartoon, interspersed with current (1983) on location examinations of cathedrals. The viewer will certainly gain an understanding of the social, economic and religious contexts of cathedrals in a light-hearted, amiable documentary.

Secondly, this film's dated quality appeals greatly to my sense of nostalgia for my childhood. I was only 7 when I first saw ""Cathedral"" and it captivated my imagination with a sense of wonder about the days of old when monks and kings and maidens were not just the stuff of legend. It was the beginning of a lifetime's interest in the subjects of religion and medieval history. Everytime I watch it, I feel like I am reliving two histories- the days of the great cathedrals and my own childhood afternoons in the long and cold winters of Michigan. Everyone needs those touchstones that remind them of the past's magic and sense of wonder, and this film does that for me. Give it a shot. I think you'll like it.",1156550400,69,1181,4.905
