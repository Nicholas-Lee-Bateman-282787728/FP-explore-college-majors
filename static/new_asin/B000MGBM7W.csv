8168583,3,B000MGBM7W,"Where to start about this? How about the title?

The ""Angie"" of ""Angie's Fantasies"" is Angie Savage. She just happens to be the least-attractive member of the four-model cast, which also includes the fake big bustes of Tyler Faith and Devon Lee. I don't like breast implants and all three of these women have them, but Lee and Faith are far better-looking than Savage. The saving grace here is Rita Faltoyano, all-natural and just plain smoking hot (also not a Peach regular--actually, this whole cast is a little different for Peach, and so is the director which probably explains a few things).

The opening few shots is a huge bait-and-switch. We get a long, strong look at a naked, spread-legged Savage and it seems like ""OH, OK, this is going to be a good addition to the library."" Unfortunately it's mostly downhill from there, with no more explicit nudity and very few shots of genuine full-frontal nudity. A major opportunity lost.

Not only that, but the direction, editing and photography are sub-par for a Peach presentation of this era (2007). Instead of the well-lit sets that we're used to from this company, we get a whole lot of scenes shot in utter darkness with a constantly-moving camera. And for some reason the light of a laser pointer shows up in several. I don't know if this was the work of an inexperienced editor (or cameraman) or of an unconfident one working with women, but there's a whole lot of panning the camera to certain areas of their bodies and then quickly darting away.

There also are some things that are just a little weird and perplexing here with respect to direction, like one scene where a supposed assistant tries to give one of the models a ringing cell phone and gets sent from the room. What?? How did this add anything to the production? It wasn't funny.

Without that opening shot and without Faltoyano, this gets two stars from me. But Faltoyano is such a standout that her scene alone makes everything a little better.",1379808000,2,1972,4.7043478260869565
