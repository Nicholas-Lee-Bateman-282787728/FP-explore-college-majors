8026642,5,B0002DF0HS,"A terrific and easy to understand beginner guide to chess piece movement, where pieces are placed to start the game. Part of the video is discussed in a small classroom environment with a group of fairly young children (ages 6-10 I am guessing) so this is ideal for kids.

Disc 1 covers ALL the chess pieces movements, Castling (en passant is not discussed or explained), check, checkmate, stalemate and solid basic opening theory. A great way for kids or anyone with NO experience to start to learn about chess with solid fundamentals.

By the end of the 2nd disc set you will be able to play a chess game and have a good idea where to start and some basic theory on how to open and and in what order to develop and move your pieces to eventually win a chess game.",1430006400,,765,4.380281690140845
