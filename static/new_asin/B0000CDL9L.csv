7998992,5,B0000CDL9L,I used it for an elective course with HS seniors and they enjoyed it.  It was in friendly and easy to follow format.  Not sure how some might find DVD discussion very old religions as 'dated'.  The subject is by it's nature dated.,1311033600,2,230,4.3023255813953485
7998993,5,B0000CDL9L,"One of the finest, most objective and informational discussions of world religions EVER! I originally got it because of Lew Ayres personal history as a pacifist in WWII. I wanted to see how it manifested itself in his later career...

The artistry is amazing, the narration is easy to follow and well thought out.",1267747200,5,313,4.796296296296297
7998994,3,B0000CDL9L,"The video starts with the narrator saying that the video will not be making judgments about any of the religions.  Its main idea is to expose us to these different religions.  Covered on this tape is Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shinto.  Missing from this is Sikhism.  It does cover many of the different sects, but there is no formula for how much is covered on each.
This video was filmed in the 1970s, and for those of us used to more modern videos, this will seem a bit odd.  At times, when a particular holy man is focusing on God (or the Ultimate or gods), the producers tried to add special effects.  I found these to be distracting.  When taking with the dialogue, it seems like an editorial comment on the religion.
If you are just looking for a quick explanation, this would work. At the end is a quick summary of all the religions covered in the series (it includes the Western religions...which is where Sikhism is discussed).  I would not use it in a classroom environment, because most textbooks I have viewed go into much deeper detail.",1020988800,13,1055,4.544973544973545
7998995,3,B0000CDL9L,"Rather than go into too much detail, this video will give a very brief history about the Western religions, and then will touch on the major ideas of each.  Islam, Judaism, and Christianity are covered, but oddly enough, so is Sikhism.  I still don't understand why.
