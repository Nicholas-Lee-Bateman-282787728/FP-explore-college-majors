8093862,4,B000BY24FE,"This a great video of some of the greatest intercontinental matches of the 1980's. Unfortunately, there are many highlights but the matches that are shown mostly in their entirety and incredible. It starts out with a match involving the first intercontinental champion Pat Patterson defending his title against the Olympic strongman, Ken Patera. This is a great match that lasts almost twenty minutes. Other matches include:

Patera vs. Pedro Morales

Morales vs. Don Muraco

Muraco vs. Morales---Texas Death match

Morales vs. Muraco

Muraco vs. Santana

Santana vs. Greg Valentine

Santana vs. Randy Savage

Savage vs. Ricky Steamboat

Most of the later matches in the tape are only highlights, but I believe the Morales---Muraco matches, which are shown mostly in their entirety, are worth the price of the video alone. All in all, I think this a terrific video and a great collector's item to have espcially if you enjoy wrestling of the 1980's.",1168646400,,949,5.150326797385621
