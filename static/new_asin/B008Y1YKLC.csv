8532346,3,B008Y1YKLC,"The story here is fairly simple. Having been abandoned in a piano store as a baby, fourteen-year-old Frost does not fit in at school. She works up the courage to tell a boy that she has a crush on him only to be brutally mocked. He calls her ""ugly,"" and soon enough, just about the entire school takes up the chant of ""ugly."" Her locker is covered with post-it notes with ""ugly,"" ""go home orphan,"" ""EW!,"" and ""ifea"" on them.

Then she gets a text message from God, who grants her three wishes. She first wishes that her parents had never abandoned her. Faster than you can say ""Merry Christmas"" (which is actually God's response), she is back with her parents. Bad move. They use her as part of a planned robbery. Frost soon realizes the bad situation, but she's still got two more wishes. Her second wish is that ""everyone"" love her. Of course, this turns out badly, too. And I won't divulge the third wish, but it isn't a great choice either.

Initially, there's a great deal here that's wrong. The taunting at the start is over-the-top, and the acting is not all that good (from performers who are significantly better later in the film). The Christmas connection (and there is one, albeit not a strong one) is forced. And the redemption at the end is far less powerful than it could be.

That said, there are certainly points to be said in the film's favor. First of all, it's a fantasy film. So the excessive nature of the taunting should be interpreted in that light. The first two wishes are also fantastic (in the literal sense of relating to fantasy) as it turns out her parents are amazingly high-level thieves and as the desire for ""everyone"" to love Frost naturally turns her into a celebrity of the highest order. This is a film for young people, and the nth-degree treatment is pretty much to be expected. The young actor who plays Frost (Leah Gaston) and Frost's sister is generally pretty good, certainly solid enough to pull off the roles. And despite what was probably not a tremendously substantial budget, writer/director Arik Renee Avila did a good job of hiding any technical shortcomings. Actually, more than that, Avila shows some real promise here. There are missteps, but there are some wonderful shots and nice directorial touches along the way.

For parents, there is little to object to in this film. I don't recall any swearing. There's certainly no nudity. There is some violence. Frost is knocked down when two other girls open a door as she is running down the hall, and during the robbery, there are two gunshots during the robbery, but they are offscreen, and we see neither the gun nor the results of the shots (although it's certainly implied that there are two particular adult victims). As I write this, there is one other review, which claims that the plot is hard to follow. I disagree. I think that reviewer might have been confused about the details of the high-tech robbery (which I would agree was a poor choice or poorly set up), but it's crystal clear what's going on in the movie.

Finally, I should note that, according to the official site of the film, this movie was distributed to churches. That raises the issue of the theological message of the film. It's clearly Christian, but it's quite non-sectarian. Of course, getting text messages from God presupposes there is a God, but there are no hot-button issues here that might cause controversy.

Overall, I think young girls (maybe 9 to 12) will enjoy this.",1389225600,3,3461,4.665573770491803
8532347,2,B008Y1YKLC,this is for young girls ..... very confusing storyline even for an adult.  Not a Christmas movie.  Just didn't like this movie and would not recommend it.,1383955200,2,154,4.666666666666667
