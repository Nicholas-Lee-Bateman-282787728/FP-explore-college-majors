8758380,5,B01EDDCFHA,"I would add this film to a list of classic ""road"" pictures shown in a documentary entitled Wanderlust.  Last Cab is different, and enthralling, though serious and intended for a mature audience.  I would also recommend another offbeat foreign film mentioned in the documentary, Y Tu Mama Tambien.",1486512000,,296,5.145833333333333
8758381,4,B01EDDCFHA,"This was a sweet, touching film with several messages without being preachy.  Enjoyed traveling through Australia and sharing the journey.  I also liked the cast and writing.  Nicely done.  Longer than I like a film to be, but in this case, it worked.",1476576000,,251,4.767441860465116
8758382,5,B01EDDCFHA,"Directed by Jeremy Sims (Last Train to Freo, Beneath Hill 60) from a screenplay by Sims and Reg Cribb (Last Train to Freo, Bran Nue Dae) adapted from Crib's play of the same name, Last Cab to Darwin is a moving Australian indie film about a man trying to take control of his life, or more specifically, of the end of his life when he finds out that his cancer is terminal.

The film, set in Australia in the 1990's, begins when Rex (wonderfully played by Michael Caton), a crusty old cab driver who's apparently lived his whole life in the small town of Broken Hill in New South Wales, finds out that his cancer treatment has failed and that his cancer has spread to the point that nothing further can be done. Rather than just wait around through weeks of increasing pain and incapacity before death finally comes, Rex has an alternate plan in mind.  He's heard of a clinic up in Darwin in the Northern Territory where a Dr. Farmer (Jacki Weaver) has been lobbying to allow the first use of a voluntary euthanasia machine that would allow terminally ill patients like Rex to end their own lives in a quiet, controlled - and pain-free - manner. After hearing the doctor on a talk show on his taxi's radio, Rex calls her up on the show and says he's ready to be the first and that he's on his way, then hangs up before the concerned doctor can get a word in edgewise. His plan is simple:  drive his taxi over 3000 kilometers (almost 2000 miles) across the heart of the continent to Darwin, check into the clinic, and then check out.  Or at least it seems simple as he first conceives it, but as he prepares to set out, he begins to realize that it's not going to be that simple.

For one thing, it seems like everyone in Broken Hill recognized him on the talk show and knows what he's planning, including all of his mates at the local watering hole and Polly (Ningali Lawford), an Aboriginal woman who lives across the street from him and with whom he's been discreetly carrying on for years, but never publicly due to the racist attitudes that still linger, particularly in small towns.  His friends and Polly aren't happy about what he's planning to do and do their best to dissuade him, but Rex has his mind made up.

On his way north, Rex encounters a number of people, two of which end up hitching a ride with him.  Tilly (Mark Coles Smith), a chatty freewheeling black fixer-of-all-things (except himself), and Julie (Emma Hamilton), a British nurse who decided to bum around Australia after her last relationship went sour. Watching Tilly and Julie and dealing with them causes Rex to ponder his own life, what he's done and what he's about to do.

While the film deals with a serious issue - facing the end of life - it leavens things with bits of dry, wry Aussie-style humor, like this exchange between Rex and Tilly:

Rex:  ""Got me a dog.""
Tilly:  ""What's it's name.""
Rex:  ""Dog.""
Tilly:  ""Just 'Dog'?""
Rex:  "" 'Rex' was taken.""

Another highlight of the film is the lush cinematography by Steve Arnold (Terra Nova, Turning April) that immerses  you in the feel of a being on a long trip through the Australian outback.

Based on a true story, Last Cab to Darwin never takes the easy road. It goes where it needs to go and just takes you along for the ride.

Highly, highly recommended.",1469750400,2,3295,4.461666666666667
8758383,5,B01EDDCFHA,"Obviously aspects of this film are targeted at an American market, as we call cabs taxis here in Australia, and the colour of the one in this film is yellow like a New York cab. This isn't a bad film though. I knew it was based on the story of a terminally ill guy who drove his taxi to Darwin to take advantage of the court decision to make euthanasia legal. But didn't know much else about what the movie was going to be about going in. I was surprised it was very heavy on indigenous Australians issues. Films that normally include this sort of thing can easily offend their audiences who don't like feeling lectured to or don't agree with the angle the film is taking on these topics. But Last Cab to Darwin somehow avoids either taking an angle or coming across as lecturing on the issues it raises. Such as in Broken Hill (where Rex the Taxi driver lives) the indigenous woman who lives across the street feels she isn't allowed in the pub and also wants to live a white fella life by having a job and living in a house in town by herself. Also Tilly a passenger who fixes a broken windshield for Rex and convinces him to take him along with him on the journey was good enough to be selected in a first grade AFL team but substance abuse derailed his success. Theres obviously been some editing before the movie was finished to avoid controversy or whatever as in the deleted scenes (assuming the US version has the same ones as the Australian DVD), Tilly uses a line where he tells the story of a really smart and determined mudcrab who works out how to escape from a bucket and while the fisherman isn't looking climbs to the rim. But the other crabs drag him back down and tell him bruva you're one of us you cant escape what you are. Its also refreshing to see the film gave other indigenous actors a go, rather than just using the usual Ernie Dingo, Jessica Mauboy or Deborah Mailman.

Besides the indigenous issues the film obviously raises the right to die argument through Rexs character, as well as the euthanasia doctor and her determination to use Rex as a martyr, as well as through the eyes of Julie, a backpacker who is a nurse back in the UK who decides to help Rex do whatever he wants in his final days but isn't convinced the desire to die is really what Rex wants. Its well filmed, obviously theres a fair bit of outback scenery along the taxi journey. Rex is well played by Michael Caton, as are the other leads playing Tilly (Mark Coles Smith) and Julie (Emma Hamilton). Whether you are pro or anti the right to die on your own terms, youll still enjoy this movie, as it is a very well told tale.",1461283200,,2623,4.33130081300813
8758384,4,B01EDDCFHA,"Rex (Michael Canton) is a old cab driver who discovers they ""didn't get it all."" He is dying from cancer when he discovers a doctor in remote Darwin has a legal suicide machine. Rex has friends, but no family. He travels to Darwin to use the untested machine and picks up a couple of people along the way who he touches and they assist him.

Based on a play by the same name, the story touches you as we see friends become family.
