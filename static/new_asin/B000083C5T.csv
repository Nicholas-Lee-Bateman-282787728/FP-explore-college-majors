1823660,5,B000083C5T,SUPER SUSPENSE MOVIE.  BLAIR UNDERWOOD PLAYED THE CHANCE CHARACTER TO THE HILT.  JUST SHOWS WHAT AN EXCELLENT ACTOR HE IS. I'M GLAD I FOUND THIS BLACK TREASURE AND NOW HAVE IT IN MY POSSESSION. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.,1121299200,4,224,4.717948717948718
1823661,4,B000083C5T,I saw this movie last night on cable and said to myself that I have to add this to my collection.  I had never even heard of it until last night!!!!  At first I wondered why Michael Beach didn't play Chance's role but then I saw how Blair Underwood stole the show and fitted the part perfectly.  Very versatile and realistic.  I try to support black movies but only if they are not degrading and buffoonish.  Asunder was none of that!  Can't wait to get my copy in the mail.,1109894400,3,474,4.211111111111111
1823662,5,B000083C5T,I went to the premier of this movie.  I know the owner of the production company and was invited to go.  I have seen this movie 3x.  It is excellent and I have even bought the DVD.  I absolutely love this version of the black Fatal Attraction.  Blair Underwood was outstanding in his part.  I highly recommend buying this for your DVD collection.,1074556800,10,346,4.412698412698413
1823663,5,B000083C5T,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I remember receiving an email when the movie was to be released.  However, it didn't receive any support and I don't think it was even in the theaters longer than a week.  How unfortunate.  This movie was excellent.  Just goes to show how the media down plays black actors, writers and producers.  If you can sit and watch ""28 Days Later"" (which is an absolute mess of a movie) shame on you for not supporting this suspenseful drama.  This movie shall become a part of my personal collection.  THE BOMBDIGITY FOR SURE.",1068508800,16,552,4.618556701030927
1823664,4,B000083C5T,"this movie really cast me Asunder.  At times it seemed as if the actors were speaking in a combination of morse code and tourette's syndrome.  Very hard to follow.  But, alas, the overall ensunderment value exceeds 25 cosmic units.  which will you choose, death or glory?  see this movie and find out.",1064188800,,301,4.711538461538462

Chance soon begins to act a bit odd, and develops a completely different personality. Loren and Michael try to be helpful, but find themselves drawn into the vortex of Chance's disintegrating sanity. ASUNDER is a drama for the most part, w/ each cast member revealing personal secrets that could ruin their lives. It is near the end of the movie when it shifts into full horror / thriller mode. Chance's madness takes over entirely, causing him to go on a murderous rampage. Well worth watching, especially the last 20 minutes or so...",1384992000,,779,4.909090909090909

A line he says ''It won't stop the pain.....'' or something like that broke my heart to the core. Cant imagine losing a loved one...let alone a SPOUSE in death.

1823706,5,B000083C5T,"I can't believe that this movie didn't receive as much attention as it deserves. All the actors were great but Blair Underwood stole the screen. His transition from nice to ""bad"" was so believable. His decent to madness was worth watching. It was very suspenseful and made you want to know how it ended. It shows what can almost happen in real life when someone loses a loved one and feels betrayed by a friend. When death occurs, many people need someone to blame and this movie definitely shows the effects of anger, betrayal, hurt, seduction and innocence all wrapped in one.  It ""almost"" makes you feel sorry for the bad guy(Blair) for a moment. Debbie Morgan and Michael Beach were also excellent!",1338768000,,702,4.7073170731707314
1823707,3,B000083C5T,"I always knew Blair was a good actor but he really shined in this role. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It comes off as a low budget made-for-BET movie at first but it went way past expectations. I wouldn't say this is a great movie but it keeps you entertained because of Underwood.

Debbie Morgan was a delight as well and knowing her from television work and as AMC's Angie, I was surprised to see her in a film like this. I never thought of her as acting in something like this and it was refreshing to see her in this role.

Michael Beach was completely out shined. His role wasn't memorable or convincing at all. He was jealous when he shouldn't have been yet dumb and blind to what is going on around him. He had no commonsense and his character could've been written with more depth. I've seen Beach in a lot of movies and to me he tends to overact sometimes and he seemed off the mark with this role. He didn't seem comfortable with the dialogue and his scenes seemed forced. He had zero chemistry with Morgan while she and Underwood oozed so much sexual chemistry it oozed off the screen.

I think the film was too short and more could've been done. Some scenes were unnecessary and pointless. At times it was like the film was pieced together in the wrong spots. But Underwood was mesmerizing and looking forward to him in each scene was the only thing that kept me watching.

I applaud Tim Reid for trying to give us a black Fatal Attraction but it wasn't without issues. We should've known more background about Chance (Underwood) and why he acts the way he acts. We're led to believe he snaps when his wife and unborn child dies, but then Michael (Beach) shares with Lauren (Morgan) that Chance always had a dark side. Which is it? Did he snap or was he always a nut? You can't have it both ways.

The production had some issues as well. The film comes off cheap and probably because it was. But just because a movie is cheap doesn't mean it has to look like it. The setting and the annoying saxophone music in the background reminded me of some 1970's porn flick. The outside shots were nice but there were major lighting issues in a lot of scenes with Blair in his place that made the film look cheap.

Morgan's character seemed strong but she did have some brain fart moments going on. Chance stalked her constantly before she even thought of calling the police. And since she wanted him to leave her alone so badly it was hard for me to believe she'd continue to keep her and Chance's affair a secret knowing if she told it could free her from him. But she wasn't the only one acting dumb. Even after Michael is beaten by a crazed Chance and even knows Chance is nuts he still allows him to stay with him and his wife. In what world would that happen? So yes, some things didn't make sense.

With some fine-tuning, a few more dollars for production, some tweaking on the writing and better development for Beach's character, this could've been a five star film. The acting is not bad at all, even Beach's though he could've been better. So the movie does have it's interesting points but also some ridiculous ones.",1333238400,,3161,4.402397260273973

I've always adored Blair Underwood.  He's been my favorite actor and my nomination as the next Denzel for his excellent and natural acting skills.  Michael Beach and Debbi Morgan get a chance in this film to also show their great acting ranges too.  Also loved the music by someone named Lionel, especially the funeral dirge ""Wings"" which brought me to tears.  Tim Reid - continue doing films.

1823734,5,B000083C5T,"I love this movie and feel that I must write a review to clear up a few things in a description on a couple of other sites. The person who wrote the description says Chance is out for revenge because he blames his best friend Michael for his wife's death. This is true, but the reason given is incorrect and just stupid. It says Chance believes Michael somehow plotted to kill his wife in a freak accident. The reviewer says that Chance believed that Michael planned the scenario because Michael knows Chance had an affair with his wife, Lauren. That is not what happens in this movie. Not only is this information they're disseminating too simplistic, it's incorrect and makes a quality movie sound silly. Even Chance, as irrational as he gets, doesn't make this dumb accusation (especially since Roberta is the one whom dictates the circumstances in the situation). He blames Michael simply because he can, and it is easier then blaming himself. It makes me wonder did the person writing the description for these sites really watch the movie. I don't know why they didn't do what Amazon has done and just use the synopsis on the back of the DVD. Nice job Amazon! You just give the pertinent statistics and back cover synopsis and let people decide for themselves, and they should decide to buy this movie.

To begin, this movie is so engrossing. I initially only saw the last 30 minutes or so, and I had to make sure that the next time it came on cable my husband and I would watch it. It was better and much more complicated than I thought. This movie is everything the description on the back of the DVD builds it up to be. Michael Beach, Debbi Morgan, and Blair Underwood are all extraordinary actors and Tim Reid is an extraordinary director. So I really shouldn't have expected anything less. The fact that Tim Reid undertook this project says a great deal. He is known for making sure that quality material, which otherwise would be overlooked by Hollywood, gets out for us to enjoy. The director and actors really have created an excellent work of suspense, passion, and deception.  Even though all of this great drama and suspense is going on, you can get a peek at the inner components of Michael and Lauren's marriage. Most movies -- in order to make the dichotomy in a situation of infidelity more concrete -- only juxtapose a ""BAD"" spouse with a ""GOOD"" spouse. Almost forcing the audience to identify and empathize with the spouse being cheated on. In Asunder, you get a glimpse of how complicated the inner dynamics of a marriage can get; how everything can't be broken down into good versus bad; and how often there is a breakdown in the marriage before there is infidelity. It is not a mere spin or retelling of Fatal Attraction; it is much more complicated. There is a wicked dynamic between the three main characters, but it is not a typical love triangle situation. Neither of the three is an angel, but you become attached and feel for them. They are truly round, multidimensional characters.

While Chance is recovering at Michael's home from an injury he suffers during the accident that killed his pregnant wife, old feelings he has for Lauren resurface. The trauma and grief compounded with his feelings for her makes him totally irrational and obsessed. Chance is beyond grief-stricken, he is suffering from some form of post-traumatic stress disorder. His character and understanding progressively deteriorate to where he has no rationale at all. It is not about revenge because revenge is a rational act and Chance is clearly not a rational being. He doesn't know or care if Michael knows about his affair with Lauren. Michael is almost irrelevant to him. He wants what he wants and nothing will stand in his way, not the memory of Roberta, his best friend Michael, or Lauren herself.  I won't say any more because I don't want to spoil it for others as some reviews do. I tried not to mention anything not in other reviews or not in the first ten minutes. It is an excellent movie with great music, most of it done by Lionel Cole. Too bad there was no soundtrack. I had to own this DVD. IT'S A MUST HAVE!",1135296000,25,4134,4.64344262295082
