8370686,5,B002I2PI3M,"Good cinematography, interesting narration, good color, high resolution, maybe I'll go to Mt. Rainier someday and take some pictures too.",1365638400,,137,5.9
8370687,5,B002I2PI3M,Everything I could of imagined.  Definitely makes me regret living in Illinois.  I would recommend this to anyone that appreciates nature overall or is looking to visit Mt rainier.  Quality interviews with some good climbers too.,1355184000,,229,5.305555555555555
8370688,4,B002I2PI3M,"Video covers most aspects of the mountain, its history, and what to do. In some ways it's similar to Barcott's ""Measure of a Mountain"" but offers it in video rather than text. It's not highly technical in things to do at Rainier or the definitive work on everything about the mountain, but as a general overview of the mountain I found it interesting and informative.

Quality was quite good although certain parts of my Blu-Ray skipped a frame or two.",1346457600,,452,4.65
8370689,5,B002I2PI3M,"If you like Mt. Rainier, you will like the video. The videography is not Galen Rowell, but it always reminds me of being there. I moved to Tennessee, so I don't get to go play on the mountain.",1320796800,2,192,4.078947368421052
8370690,5,B002I2PI3M,This is an excellent documentary about an excellent mountain! Mt. Rainier stands out more than any other mountain in the lower 48 meaning that while Mt. Whitney might be the tallest it doesn't appear to jut straight out of the ground because other mountains are close around. Rainier is the prettiest roughest to climb mountain to climb in America taking more deaths than any other excluding Alaska! Soundtrack is amazing as well as the aerials. Buy it!,1274054400,3,453,4.896103896103896
8370691,4,B002I2PI3M,Blu-Ray is a combination of fresh High Def (mostly aerial) content and historical standard def footage.  This brought back fond memories of hiking on the mountain and staying at Paradise Lodge.  I wish there had been more High Def content however.,1258675200,3,247,5.0
