International movies do not seem to work on American equipment.",1441324800,,96,4.705882352941177
8100443,3,B000CQLZ2Y,"THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE CAMPIEST FILMS EVER MADE-IT SHOWS UP ON THE OLD MOVIE CHANNELS ONCE IN A WHILE AND IT ALWAYS IS AMUSING. THE REAL ""SQUARES"" IN THIS MOVIE ARE THE WOULD -BE PROMO EXECS TALKING THE LINGO OF THE TIME IN A TOTALLY LAUGHABLE MANNER.  IT'S REALLY FUNNY IN THE CLUB SCENES.  MOST OF THE AUDIENCE ARE OLDER AND LOOK LIKE THEY WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH  PATTI PAGE.  IF THERE IS NO DANCING, THE AUDIENCE SITS LIKE ZOMBIES WHILE THE ARTISTS ARE ROCKING OUT. THERE IS NO HEAD BOBBING, FOOT TAPPING OR ANYTHING. THE APPLAUSE SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE CLAPPING FOR A KINDERGARTEN GRADUATION. I NOMINATE THIS MOVIE TO BE SEEN ON MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000.",1404345600,,675,4.463414634146342
8100444,5,B000CQLZ2Y,"The cover on this DVD is misleading as it is an old picture of Bill with Rudy & Rudy was not with the Comets (I believe that he passed away at this time) & the Comets were mostly young, but talented, players. They did a good job, but, it wasn't the same as before (time goes on, doesn't it, along with all of it's changes). The quality of the DVD is great & if you are a Bill Haley fan, you won't be sorry as long as you realize the show is not what is on the cover.  +JMJ+",1325548800,,473,3.7777777777777777
8100445,3,B000CQLZ2Y,The picture quality was awful but I really was not expecting much given the recording date. It will remind you of footage taken with an old 12mm camera from the audience. However the excitement of Bill Haley and His Comets is there nevertheless and worth having if you like Bill Haley.,1209340800,3,285,4.607843137254902
8100446,3,B000CQLZ2Y,"Recording video and sound quality is not good at all compared to today's standards. I guess considering the age of the video it's OK. Haley is not backed up by all his original comets, but the band is doing a good job.",1199145600,2,218,4.214285714285714
8100447,5,B000CQLZ2Y,"Before Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, and Chuck Berry popularized rock & roll, BILL HALEY AND HIS COMETS had already scored a number of hit songs in the genre. Beginning his career as a country singer and musician, Haley was a member of a number of bands in the late 1940s before forming The Comets in 1952. They were among the first to combine country with rhythm and blues into the form that would become known as rock music, and became hugely famous in 1953 with the number one hit ""Rock Around the Clock."" However, once those latter-day musicians became superstars playing rock & roll, Haley's pioneering work was quickly forgotten. Viewers can rediscover Haley and his contribution to popular music with this release, featuring footage of his band performing their most famous songs from this concert filmed at the Birmingham Odeon in the UK in 1979.
The latest Rockabilly craze (the Teds, greasers, brothel creepers, ducktail haircuts) was in full swing in the UK in 1979 and would also see the revival of the Mod phenomenon (similar Beach side clashes between the Mods and Rockers would ensue). Although the quality of the recording is not like today's standards, this DVD has been released primarily for historical value as it was the last ever professional performance by Bill Haley outside of the USA.
