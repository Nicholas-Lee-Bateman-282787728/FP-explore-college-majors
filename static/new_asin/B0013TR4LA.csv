8252868,2,B0013TR4LA,"L.A.X. VS Motor City Machine Guns VS Rock N' Rave Infection: A good opening match.

Jay Lethal VS Petey Williams: A decent match but im a little burned out on x-division matches.

Eric Young @ Kaz VS Relik @ Black Reign: The story for this match was stupid. Eric Young is a talented wrestler with some stupid gimmicks. Kaz was a main eventer last year and now he is back in the midcard. The match was decent but nothing speical.

ODB VS Gail Kim: Read all other wrestling reviews regarding women wrestling.

Team 3-D VS Curry Man and Shark Boy: I bought this dvd because of this match. Call me crazy but I love Curry Man! Funny stuff thru out the match including Curry Man reeling Ray with a ho ho on a fishing pole. This is not a match, just really funny. The ending was cool.

Booker T VS Robert Roode: I care for neither man and this match wasn't too good at all.

Rhino VS James Storm in a Elevation X match: I think this matches are boring and this was no different. Rhino wins a match!

Samoa Joe, Christian Cage, Kevin Nash VS Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, Tomko: Anther six man tag team match for a TNA PPV main event and nothing really happened here. It was a good match but nothing speical.

Overall, a decent event but not the best from TNA.",1240272000,,1247,4.254237288135593
8252869,3,B0013TR4LA,"L.A.X. vs. Motor City Machine Guns vs. Rock N' Rave Infection - Before the match gets started, if your a Guns N' Roses/Slash fan then you'll love Lance Hoyt's outfit. This was a awesome opener as it was fast paced with all three teams putting in one hell of an effort. From the synchronized teamwork of the MCMG while you know L.A.X. never disappoints with their performance while this ranks right up there with Final Resolution with my favorite showing from Hoyt & Rave.

X Division Champion Jay Lethal vs. Petey Williams - After going through the whole Team 3D angle, the X division is back to doing what it does best & that's putting on good matches. They started off right off the bat by countering each others moves ending with the standoff and from there, put on a good wrestling match. I usually don't like run-ins during matches (TNA usually gives them overkill) but they worked for the better here as they didn't ruin the match & continued the current storylines revolving both men & others involved like So Cal Val & Sonjay Dutt.

Eric Young & Kaz vs. Black Reign & Rellik - This match was all about the debut of the Super Eric character as Kaz was carring the match while Eric Young kept acting scared of Reign & Rellik until he ran away & returned as a superhero. This is one of those ""put a storyline/gimmick over"" matches that you'll like if your a fan of Eric Young's character but I just feel like Kaz was heavy misused here as he's been since the beginning of the year & I didn't care for the ""match"" at all.

Womens Champion Awesome Kong vs. Gail Kim vs. O.D.B. - Right from the start, both knockouts were trying overcome the dominate powerful monster in Awesome Kong by trying to double team her but Kong sends both knockouts into each other. The match was the typical formula of trying to overcome the power of Kong and all three women put on a good performance here in this match.

Fish Market Street Fight: Team 3D vs. Shark Boy & Curry Man - Before the match got started, they got the gimmick 3D has had to go through the past month out of the way stating if both members of Team 3D make weight for their match, they wouldn't have to weigh in again...and both guys did.
Now onto the match, this was a match in which if you get the joke, you'll like the match. Instead of a usual street fight of kendo sticks & baseball bats...this one was filled with fishing rods, fishing net, and real dead fish. Normally I would hate wrestlecrap matches like this but I couldn't help but laugh as I think (I'm trying to do this review from memory) there was even a moment where where Curry Man baited a fishing rod with a Hoho to reel in Brother Ray. Again, this is just for comedic purposes only & if you get the joke, you'll be entertained.

Strap Match: Booker T w/Traci Brooks vs. Robert Roode w/Payton Banks - The stipulation here is that the winner's valet gets to give out lashes with the strap on the loser's valet. I thought maybe it was just me but after reading the other reviews, I'm glad it wasn't as I just didn't enjoy this match at all. They never seemed to move out of first gear, the match was really short, and the strap was barely used for a strap match. The best part of this was everything that happened afterwards with Sharmell coming out & going crazy on everyone including giving some lashes to everyone including ring announcer David Penzer & Jim Cornette...where's the tennis racket when he needed it? LOL.

Elevation X: Rhino vs. James Storm - Storm teased starting at the top but then moved down to the floor & Rhino followed him. After fighting down there, they moved some hardcore weapons setup into the ring like a trash can & tables before Jacqueline interfeared chasing Rhino to the top where Storm followed. From here, they were very limited in what they did as it was mostly just punching while teasing to fall at various times while Storm pulled the same ""hide out"" move inside the structure that Styles did the previous year before eventually falling through the table. I gave TNA some credit last year for doing various things you normally don't see in a scaffold match to make it somewhat entertaining but this year's just showcased why scaffold matches aren't done often (if at all) for the most part as they are just boring because your waiting for someone to drop & this match was no different. This is one gimmick concept that needs to be retired.

Samoa Joe, Christian Cage, Kevin Nash vs. Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, Tomko - Due to the Cage winning the cage match that happened on Impact between Cage & Angle, Styles & Tomko are in a handicap match for the first 5 mins. Solid from start to finish with great wrestling & spots between all six men (yes, that even includes Nash who had his moments) with some standouts like Joe's dive outside onto Tomko who slammed into Tomko & right from there, Cage shoving off the superplex from the top rope onto a frog splash onto Kurt & even A.J. Styles pulled out his old ""spiral tap"" earlier in the match. The biggest part of the match to watchout for is when Joe was waiting for Angle at the entrance when it was time for Angle to come out & both stared each other down before Angle sprinted towards Joe & as they say, ""The Fight Is On!"". Great six man tag match with the only thing I can say wrong is that I wish they would have went longer but this was the six man tag match we should have gotten at Turning Point months earlier.

In the end, this was just a above average TNA PPV where they mostly delivered a great card with a couple of matches being duds (Super Eric/Strap Match/Elevation X) but I would recommend overall.

As a side note, it's too bad they didn't include the Angle/Cage six sides of steel match from Impact as an extra because that match would heavily make up for the dud matches on here...hopefully TNA will release it onto DVD someday.",1211328000,,5854,4.4230055658627085
8252870,4,B0013TR4LA,"I actually attended Destination X in Norfolk, VA back on March 9, and had a fantastic time.  What looked like a horrible card on paper turned out to be an entertaining show, and some of the matches were flat-out terrific.

Match 1:
LAX d. the Rock & Rave Infection and Motor City Machine Guns in a 3-way match
Rating - 9

This was an extremely well-crafted triple threat, with all the spots you'd expect from these guys.  Even Lance Hoyt does a great job here, believe it or not.  LAX wins when Hernandez hits the Border Toss on Jimmy Rave after Homicide nails a somersault plancha on Hoyt and the Machine Guns.

Match 2:
""Black Machismo"" Jay Lethal d. Petey Williams to retain the X-Division Title
Rating - 10

This was a perfect X-division match, the kind of spectacle that we used to see on TNA pay per views every month with Christopher Daniels and AJ Styles.  The match opened with some great chain wrestling, and the finish furthered both the Williams/Steiner and Lethal/So Cal Val storylines while making both wrestlers look good.  The crowd in the Scope ate this match up, and the DVD shows why.

Match 3
Kaz & Eric Young d. Black Reign & Rellik
Rating - 7

Any match with Black Reign & Rellik is going to be underwhelming.  Fortunately, Kaz is a talented-enough wrestler and EY an entertaining-enough one that this match doesn't completely suck.  This match is best remembered as the debut of Super Eric, who the crowd ate up, and the double-Death Valley Driver finish was pretty awesome.

Match 4
Awesome Kong d. ODB and Gail Kim to retain the TNA Women's Title
Rating - 8

The TNA Knockouts are consistenly the most-viewed wrestlers on Impact!, and this match showcased the three best women in the division.  One great spot saw Gail fly over the top for a plancha on Awesome Kong, only to be caught by the Champion.  ODB then jumps from the ring on to Gail and Kong with a Thesz Press, taking both women to the floor.  You'll never see a spot like that in a WWE ""divas"" match.  Kong retains after a second rope splash on Gail and an Awesome Bomb on ODB.

Match 5
Shark Boy & Curry Man d. Team 3D in a Fish Market Street Fight
Rating - 8

Okay, hear me out.  Going into this event, this looked like the worst match on the card.  Shark Boy and Curry Man are sometimes funny characters, but like most of wrestling's comic relief their matches are never anything special.  Team 3D has gotten old, out of shape, and pretty stale.  On top of it all, it's a gimmick match with freakin' fish.  That's a recipe for horror if I've ever heard one.

But believe it or not, this was a really fun match.  For those of us in attendance, Brother Ray's launching of dead fish into the crowd was just the icing on the (crab) cake.  (Yes, that was a horrible joke.)  If you can get past the ridiculous spot where Curry Man bates a fishing rod with a cupcake and catches Brother Ray, this match will surprise you with its sheer entertainment value.

Match 6
Robert Roode d. Booker T in a ""Stand By Your Man Strap Match""
Rating - 6

Strap matches typically disappoint to begin with, particularly when they can end by pinfall.  But when you have a strap match with Robert Roode, there's no disappointment involved.  You know from the get-go that it will be boring.  Roode won after hitting Booker T with a foreign object, forcing Traci Brooks to take 10 lashes from Petyon Banks after the match.  Banks decided to land more like 20 hits, prompting Booker's wife Sharmell to return to TNA and whip everyone she could find, including Banks, Roode, Jim Cornette, and a host of referees and Atlas Security guys.

Match 7
Rhino d. James Storm in an Elevation X match
Rating - 7

Elevation X is a stupid concept.  Even in person, it does not look nearly as impressive as the TNA announcers would have you believe.  And when the loser falls from the bottom of the structure, it really amounts to a fall of about 10 feet.  Painful, of course.  Worse than missing a move off the top rope?  Not really.  This match did feature some outstanding storytelling, but in terms of action it was about as limited as you'd expect.

Match 8
Samoa Joe, Christian Cage, and Kevin Nash d. Kurt Angle, AJ Styles, and Tomko in a 6-man tag
Rating - 7

Despite featuring four of my favorite wrestlers in the world today, this was a disappointing main event.  Because of time overruns in previous segments, the match only got about 15 minutes of air time, including 5 minutes of 3-on-2 handicap action with Kurt Angle in the back.  This match would've been a pretty good Impact! main event, but was a very disappointing way to end Destination X.  Joe made Tomko tap out to the Coquina Clutch.

Other Notes: The show is filled with annoying interview segments with the main event participants, so watch out for those.  There is an easter egg on the second page of the ""Chapters"" menu; press up twice to highlight the TNA logo, then press enter.  You'll get to watch a bunch of highlights from the show over a generic rock song.  The extra match is a tag team match from Impact! pitting Christian and Nash against Styles and Tomko.",1210809600,,5090,4.464208242950108
