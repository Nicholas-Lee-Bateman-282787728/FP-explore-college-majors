6248162,4,B00I3HFANO,"It's a trip to the woods, but not a bunch of horny teenagers. Rather, it's six of the most unpleasant adults you'll ever meet. And yet the story works. It's not so much that you sympathize with anyone as that you're just fascinated to see all the dominoes come falling down.",1403222400,4,274,4.392156862745098
6248163,4,B00I3HFANO,"The movie is slasheresque. The feeling is less like a typical slasher and more like a home invasion/thriller though. There are 6 characters who come together like a group of misfits. Someone's changed and so people who usually wouldn't be at a party together find themselves there anyway. That sets up some tensions between characters and provide red herrings as to ""whodunnit"". Or better yet, who'sdoingit"". Oh- and how could I forget the strange cabin owner. The reveal was a surprise to me, which I really appreciated. So often its not but this one pulls it off. The acting and production values are adequate, totally fine. Nothing fancy but not subpar either. The ending was also a surprise. Overall, I really enjoyed this one..",1400889600,4,732,4.911290322580645
6248164,4,B00I3HFANO,"I agree with the above reviewer. It was a good slasher. You know watching, that each of the characters has a secret to hide. It goes back and forth a little bit, and I thought I knew who the killer was, But I was wrong. It sort of surprised me who the killer was and the ending was good.",1398902400,,287,3.8813559322033897
6248165,1,B00I3HFANO,"I'm not sure how some movies get the green light?  I'm not in the industry, so that aspect of the process is completely lost to me.  However, there has got to be someone watching these and thinking, ""Why are we still wasting money on this?!""  It's really not that hard.  But I ramble.  The movie, in itself, could have been a fairly entertaining one, but the problem lies with EVERYTHING involved (with the exception of the film/visual quality).  Let's start with the writing.  They spend so much time trying to trick the audience with the whole ""who-done-it"" they failed to actually make an interesting story.  For starters, we have the whole crew going to a cabin in the woods for some sort of bachelor/bachelorette party.  Not sure who does that, but whatever.  They arrive to the most outrageous groundskeeper in history.  He basically yells at them to do everything his way, even though he's RENTING the cabin,.and for what seems like an insane amount of money at that.  More of what you'd expect continues to happen and even things you don't expect (and don't care about).  Every male character in this movie is a waste of acting time, as they are all horrible.  The women aren't any better.  Plain and simple, this movie has terrible writing, terrible acting, and a terrible storyline.  The continued ""twists"" that are thrown in don't do it any favors as they just make the writers seem more desperate to try and hold our attention.

Final Verdict:  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

6248166,4,B00I3HFANO,"If you are married, theres a good chance you are familiar with the intense stress that comes from planning a wedding.  The tension usually weighs more heavily on the bride, which is a key element to director Nicholas Humphries recent release, DEATH DO US PART.  In this film, bride-to-be Kennedy is whisked away with her fiancee and some friends to a cabin for a weekend stag party.  But the partys over pretty quickly, and the body count racks up fast.  This fun and entertaining slasher will keep you guessing, right up to the very end.

I am happily surprised by this film.  I hadnt heard of it prior to seeing the press release, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The directors resume is hefty on short films, however this is his first full-length feature.  But Im glad to report Humphries does an excellent job with this debut.  The movie is made well for the most part and delivers on several levels.

DEATH DO US PART is shot well and appears to have a high production value.  The acting is superb with Peter Benson and Julia Benson (who are married in real life) heading up a great cast.  Peter and Julia play off of each other with amazing ease, probably due in part to their real life relationship.  The rest of the cast does a great job as well, although I have to particularly single out Emilie Ullerup.  I have been a fan of her work since 2008 when I first saw her in the Syfy Channel show SANCTUARY, and she certainly does not disappoint here, either.  I hope to see more of her in the future.

The story is a lot of fun, and I especially like how the intrigue hangs in the air for the duration of the film.  The characters have to deal with the killings, but they also have to figure out who is behind them.  Is it the creepy caretaker?  Is it someone in their own group?  The paranoia is high, which keeps the audience guessing and makes this film a thrill-ride of epic proportions.  I have to applaud the script writers for the ending, as wellI can honestly say I did not see it coming.

Although DEATH DO US PART is very entertaining, I do have two minor complaints that I must voice.  First, there is drastic lack of continuity in the opening shots regarding the vehicle in which the group is traveling.  The truck is a light shade, like white or tan, and at various times, it is so splattered with mud that you barely see the paint; but in the next scene, its been through a car wash and no mud is visible.  But then we transition again and see the mud is back.  This is a small thing to mention, but it really stands out since the vehicle is a light color.

Second, the special effects were a little on the weak side.  At one point, a character gets a couple of fingers chopped off.  This person turns to look at the stump of hand, which should be awesomebut a flashlight beam catches the hand and the light goes through the rubber, illuminating the hand like a Halloween pumpkin.  This obviously looks very fake, although again, it is a minor point.

Still, DEATH DO US PART is a load of fun, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good slasher or even thriller.  Theres a lot to be thankful for here, and I cant wait to see what director Humphries does in the future.  This film is available now.",1398643200,2,3230,4.321131447587354
6248167,3,B00I3HFANO,"A group of six people go away for a weekend prior to a wedding. Wealthy anxiety prone Kennedy (Julia Benson) is getting married to Ryan (Peter Benson). The party includes Kennedy's older slightly jealous half sister Hannah (Christine Chatelain). Emily (Emilie Ullerup ) is a super friend to Kennedy. Chet (Kyle Cassie) is the best man who wants to get back with Hannah while Derek (Benjamin Ayres) is the confrontational old buddy of Ryan. He knows stuff about Ryan that make Ryan uneasy. He has his eye on Emily. They are renting a place from the overly creepy Bo (Dave Collette).

The film smartly takes it time to build and establish character and have minor confrontations. About 50 minutes or so when the body count starts to mount in this who-dun-it, the film seems to fall apart. There was nothing spectacular in the killings. The panic aspect didn't seem to work. The plot, which was well woven in the beginning, frays shortly after the first death with one of the main suspects getting killed first.

Nice little twist on the end. Too bad they couldn't deliver the middle game.  A soft 3 stars.

Parental guide: F-bomb. male rear nudity. Fully clothed sex...what was that about?",1398470400,,1187,4.775609756097561
6248168,2,B00I3HFANO,"After nearly three decades of movie viewing, I can offer this warning to all moviegoers everywhere: if a film starts with a group of people driving to a retreat, resort, vacation, or cabin while they banter with dialogue explicitly designed to show how different they all are, there's a 95% chance you're in for a dismal viewing experience. I've watched a lot of crappy movies, and this one trope seems to be the most common thread among them. It's like the iron lung of plot devices.

This movie features three guys and three girls all headed to a cabin in the woods to have a combined bachelor/bachelorette party before two of them get married. That's plot hole number one, right there. Plot hole number two pops up about ten minutes into the film when it becomes clear that none of these people like each other. This is not an exaggeration. Every single character seems to hate every other character, even the soon-to-be-wed. Not that I blame them; there isn't a likeable character in the bunch. You have the groom (a sleazeball with a secret or two), his best man (a sleazeball with an eight year old's sense of humor), and an old buddy from the past (a sleazeball in need of fast cash). The three females are nearly indistinguishable physically except they each have different colored hair. There's the bride (a loony-tune who actually brought her wedding dress to the cabin for no discernible reason), her sister (a lady with jealousy issues), and the bride's best friend (a blonde woman who appears to suffer from a rare form of functional autism).

Okay, wait. I strike my earlier comment. The blonde is the only likeable character, but that's just because she wanders through the script with an almost aggressive innocence, constantly watching the others fight or commit certain salacious deeds with a huge gasping look on her face.

This is all topped by the cabin's caretaker, a hulking mouth-breather who is trying so hard to be creepy and menacing that he may as well be named Red Herring. He pops up constantly in ways that barely make sense, including his constant demands that the revelers don't ""trash the place."" Sounds like someone's been reading Renting Your Cabin For Dummies. In a moment of unintentional hilarity, he breaks into the cabin and accuses them of trashing the place because the table is full of bottles of booze and they are playing loud music.

At this point, it's pitch black outside and everyone decides to have a scavenger hunt in the scraggly woods where they pair off and go looking for things like edible underwear, which sounds like what a prepubescent kid imagines adults do during bachelor parties. Ludicrously, most of them are game for this, and they head out into the dark forest and start to get stabbed and hacked with axes. Cue: screaming and running and paranoia.

What's weird is that the production values on this thing aren't all that bad, and even though it feels like the dialogue was written for a first year screenwriting class, the script actually tries to be clever with its secrets. Astute viewers won't have a lot of trouble guessing who the baddie is, especially if they notice how hard the movie tries to disguise that fact, but it's still kind of a nice change of pace considering how idiotic the rest of it is. There's even some decent cinematography and B-roll that, while shoehorned oddly into the film, demonstrate that there was some actual talent behind the lens.

Unfortunately, story is more important than anything else, and this is, when all is said and slashed, a pretty crappy story. Horrible people saying horrible things and then getting killed. There's not a lot more to it than that.",1398124800,6,3665,4.781990521327014
6248169,4,B00I3HFANO,"Death Do Us Part is a good slasher, but not a great one. It has good twists and turns, interesting if flawed characters, and some decent suspense. What it lacks is a great killer. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the killer in this movie isn't going to put Michael Myers or Jason out of business. Also, only one of the death scenes really got a rise of me. The rest were tame compared to most slashers. Still, this is a movie that I would recommend to people like me who can't get enough of slashers.",1397520000,4,504,4.206185567010309

8638640,2,B00I3HFANO,"""Death Do Us Part"" is another in a long line of slasher movies...that aren't very good.  A boys and girls wedding party (one week before the wedding?) turns into every man for himself.  This may have worked if ANY of the people involved had a personality.  It seems everybody hated everybody else, and the ""caretaker"" of this out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere cabin pushed it over the top.  I'm also surprised he had an opposable thumb.

What bothered me the most was ""he did it; no, she did it; no, he did it, no they did--just way too busy.  I will admit these guys at least TRIED to do something different, and with a little better casting they might have been able to pull it off,  All they managed, however, was a lot of talking loud and saying nothing.

Rated R for language and violence.",1520208000,8,789,4.546099290780142

8638645,4,B00I3HFANO,"This movie easily could have gone the other way and been really crappy, but instead it relies on a pretty good dreary atmosphere, great storytelling and a slow and tense build-up to the actual killings.  This makes Death Do Us Part pretty fantastic!  Some might think it takes too long to get to the deaths, but I don't mind due to the story.

Of course the concept is a cliche.  A group of young men and women travel to a vacation house in the woods.  The man who allows them to use the property is freaky enough (and I'm having trouble finding his name through a google search, sorry about that) but I think he would've been portrayed better had he slowly turned intimidating instead of instantly being a really bizarre and angry person.  This makes him look way too serious for his own good.  Of course he's decent enough in his role, but he should have loosened up early on.  He has eyes on Julia Benson's character, who incidentally is the main star of the film.

Julia's a week away from marrying her lover, Peter Benson's character.  Unfortunately for Julia as the movie rolls along, Peter's troubled history comes to light.  First he hits on Julia's sleazy sister (Christine Chatelain) as she's out for a morning jog.  She loves it too!  Emilie Ullerup's character (who's a good friend of Julia) happens to see what they're doing behind the shady tree and nearly can't contain herself.  She's so shocked she's almost in tears, but for the sake of the wedding (and a threat made by Christine) Emilie doesn't tell Julia that her soon to be husband is actually a lowlife scumbag.

And that's not the only troubling thing the fiance does either.  Not only is he a cheater, not only does he enjoy doing Julia's own sister, he apparently has a history of bailing out drug users hence the scene with him communicating with the other guy who came along for the ride out in the woods.  I often got this guy mixed up with the freaky angry guy above since they look so much alike, haha.  The other memorable character is Kyle Cassie.  He's the typical party animal always attempting to get a piece of you know what from one of the girls (Christine Chatelain mainly).  Doesn't work though- the two are polar opposites.

What I really love about this movie besides the slow developing storyline is that there's an element of mystery.  Who exactly is doing all this killing?  Everyone's a suspect!  I won't spoil who it is, but let's just say the person you see in the beginning... nevermind.  I would reveal too much by mentioning his or her name!  Let's just say you can figure it out if you recall an unfinished moment later on.

Anyway this is a film I surely recommend.  When the violent parts finally occur, they're pretty good and worth the wait I think.  No the killings are nothing special compared to the thousands of other horror films out there that more or less borrow the same ideas, but most horrors don't have a splendid story filled with deceit like this one does so that puts Death Do Us Part on a higher plateau.  The acting's pretty terrific too.  Julia communicates with her sleazy sister the way you'd expect.  Highly recommended.",1480723200,,3146,4.572450805008945
8638646,2,B00I3HFANO,"There are people who think making a horror/ thriller is easy- which might explain this lame excuse of a movie.  A group of obnoxious ""young"" adults go to a cabin  for a co-ed stag party (?!) but fall victim to a mad killer. They all seem to hate each other so we really don't care who survives.  The men are such wimps that one is almost cheering for the red herring care taker to kill them .  The ladies are attractive but lack personality  The murder scenes have no style so the movie lacks  suspense or shock.  There is no sex or nudity either . The location is nice but the movie is too brightly lit - it looks more like a comedy than a horror/slasher.",1474416000,2,656,4.158730158730159
