1668952,4,B00005UW7O,I remember seeing this as a teen. Over 50 years ago. Hard to believe.  Even harder is that there are 3 songs in here that I remembered the words to. I had very fond memories of this LET'S PUT ON A SHOW teen musical. It did not fade with time. Good story with a moral.  Good singing and dancing. I was so happy to see it again after all  these years.,1420156800,,349,3.887323943661972
1668953,4,B00005UW7O,I was hesitative during the first 30 minutes but was I glad I stuck it out.  A very enjoyable film!,1399852800,,99,3.95
1668954,4,B00005UW7O,"Item arrived right on time and just as the seller descbibed. In there lies the problem LOL This has nothing to do with the seller they were great. I should have found out that a Region 2 DVD would not play a regular or American DVD.I could not wait to get this and watch the Shadows perform, put in the DVD and nothing. Oh well should have found about the Region 2.",1340064000,,365,4.083333333333333
1668955,4,B00005UW7O,"I was a 13 year old in Bombay when this flick came out.  I didn't realize what a large hit it had been in England until I read the liner notes for the dvd.  But Cliff Richard was huge in India and England at the time.  The movie was an event.  Part MGM style musical, part teenage heartthrob pic.  The only real 'rock' performance came in the final scene - ""We Say Yeah!""  In 1963 this was edgy, rebellious stuff to us and ""The Shadows"" were right up there with ""The Ventures"" as an instrumental band.  Well produced.  Good performance by Robert Morely as the villain who wants to raze the teen club to build a high rise.  Brings pre-Beatle era London to life.  A fun look back.",1265155200,,678,4.2265625
1668956,5,B00005UW7O,"this movie is the best movie of cliff richard because this is where he started to take off in his career. the music and dance choreography are great. the quality of the dvd is superb. very sharp and crisp color, i could not imagine this old film to be restored in perfect condition as if this was filmed only recently. highly recommended to all cliff richard fans.",1224028800,3,364,4.447761194029851
1668957,5,B00005UW7O,"The story is about a group of young people who frequent, and run a youth club. The leader, Nicky (played by Cliff Richard) is a rebellious rock 'n' roll singer while harbouring a dark secret he must keep from the other club members. The youth club land is about to be sold to property developers unless the gang can renew the Lease. The race is on as the gang have to put on a show (secret weapon: The Mystery Singer) to raise enough money to defeat the millionaire developer (A whimsical yet menacing Robert Morley).
To some extent this is a typical vehicle for a pop star, but Cliff acquits himself well and fares better than Elvis did in some of his movies. There is a pretty good soundtrack featuring several great songs written by Cliff Richard's backing group, The Shadows, plus one or two old-fashioned musical numbers.",1011744000,17,826,4.587837837837838

7955603,3,B00005UW7O,"Okay movie as far as the plot goes.  This type of movie was popular when I was young so watched it for nostalgia reasons.  Summer Holiday, another Cliff Richard movie, is much better.",1464912000,,183,4.515151515151516
