7963516,5,B000067P3L,"I've been doing yoga for several years now, both classes and tapes. I've tried several tapes/dvds and I believe Bryan Kest's are truly the best. I've purchased five so far. The practice is very challenging, my strength and endurance have increased tremendously. The videos average from 40 minutes to just under an hour, long enough to get an excellent workout but not too long to fit it in a busy day. Some of his commentary gets a little old after a while but its a workout tape, not a movie & I can live with that. Turn down the volume & listen to Enya if it bothers you. Bottom line, I'd recommend any of his videos/dvds to any beginner/intermediate level practitioner, they're well worth the price.",1079481600,8,702,4.579365079365079
7963517,2,B000067P3L,"I liked this program for the most part. My wife and I tried it and it was pretty good, but I gotta say, that once we were used to Mark Blanchard's Progressive Power Yoga, this was just average in comparison. I think Bryan has a decent style and invigorating practice...good for a sweat, but for the core workout and the mental space that I am used to going to, I did not find this to be the best ticket to the experience. He kept taking my attention away from the workout and that felt annoying. My wife did not have that experience, but she can even tune me out when she wants to...and she has been doing yoga much longer than I have.",1076371200,3,635,4.170731707317073
7963518,5,B000067P3L,"Like the Intensive Body Sculpting tape, this tape tries to introduce Yoga to people used to mainstream fitness tapes.  I can't say if it succeeds, or if it would be comfortable for someone who is tremendously overweight to do the tape.  What I can say is that it is a great workout for many shapes of people and a great change of pace for those who are used to more traditional yoga practice.  What makes this tape unique in my experience is that Bryan repeats the movements into and out of poses several times before holding the pose.  This builds up a lot of heat and challenges your muscles and balance in a whole new way.  Even experienced students will likely be sweating hard and feeling challenged by this unfamiliar mode of practice.  He also throws some of the newer poses from this series of tapes into this one as well, and they really work in new ways to strengthen and stretch your body.  One thing is for sure, if you breathe deeply, release your self-criticism and move along with the tape, you will really heat up, sweat and feel great.  Maybe that's the beginning of something beyond just losing weight.",1062633600,15,1120,4.537313432835821
7963519,5,B000067P3L,"Bryan Kest is about my favorite Yoga instructor. I always watch a video before attempting it. In this video I noticed a few interesting changes in Bryan and his productions. First, he cut off the mop on his head and he's aged about five years --- filled out a bit and lost some of his youthful slimness. He's also lost some of his tendency to be a bit too touchy with his class. He is more polished and one senses he's a bit more commercial. Also, at the end of the video, rather than the normal ""namasta"" he said, ""thank you"". I've never heard that from a yoga instructor but guess it's okay.
Having said all that, I can tell you that this is a real workout. It's not for sissies but, at the same time, just about anyone at any level should be able to do it and, if necessary, modify some of the asanas.
What makes this such a great workout is that it's a 40 minute flow. You never stop. You will really feel your heart working and you'll build up a sweat. If you're a real advanced student you may not. But most of us will.
Bryan uses only a few basic asanas in this entire video. But it's similar to an arerbic workout in that the asanas are repeated so when you're finished, you feel like you've lifted weights and worked both the upper and lower body and also the heart. You do get your cardio. I feel it's very complete.
In my opinion, Bryan provides you with a very complete cardio as well as muscular toning workout and, while I don't know for sure, I suspect one can lose weight with it. But in any case, you'll sure feel better after doing it.
And you can modify any of the asanas. There is one student who shows the modifications or you can create your own. The music is different than Bryan's other videos. It's soft and low key, unlike his 1995 videos.
His instruction is good --- pretty easy to follow. During some of the asanas he guides you, motivates you and instructs you as to both the physical and mental aspects of the pose.
I highly recommend this video.",1032998400,48,1976,4.257978723404255
7963520,4,B000067P3L,"I started with the Energize, Sweat & Tone tapes and was a bit intimidated that I couldn't master all the moves and gracefully jump back into the positions as fast as everyone else. I really loved this tape...and the sculpting tape too. I felt that the modifications were good and in many cases I was able to complete the poses without modifications.  I feel this tape is challenging enough to keep me motivated, yet, not too challenging that I can't complete the moves....I have something to work toward.  I also enjoy the fact that he talks you through everything, the breathing, feeling comfortable in your own space and working through your practice at your own pace. If you are an expert in your yoga practice this is probably not for you, but if you are beginner/intermediate, I think you will find this tape a good addition to your yoga practice. Pay attention to your breathing and you will come away with a great workout that works your body and also calms you.",1029369600,14,969,4.627906976744186
7963521,5,B000067P3L,"I was beginning to wear out my Energize/Tone/Sweat videos, so I'm glad now to have another routine I can start incorporating into my yoga regimen.  I have never felt better doing Bryan Kest yoga routines, nor have I felt healthier.  He really gets to the heart of mental as well as physical health.  This tape gets me to work out as vigorously as the first three, and has a nicely challenging flow between movements.  I can tell I'm burning calories.  Oh yea, and I like the haircut!  Thank you, Bryan, for contributing to my health!",1023235200,8,533,4.557894736842106
