2968437,5,B000WGTD82,"I add my voice to the other customers who are irritated at the delay in getting the third installment (and any others for that matter!) of this wonderful series.  I sent out the DVD Series 1 and 2 as Christmas presents this year.

Really good television is hard to come by, even on cable, so that when one finds a series like this one, it sets one up for the rest of the installments like a heroin junkie waiting for a fix.

Please apply a little heat to the DOC MARTIN distributors and make this delightful series entirely available in the USA.",1255219200,,545,4.323529411764706

2968441,5,B000WGTD82,I have watched series three on the Internet and have greatly enjoyed series one and two that I was able to purchase through Amazon.com. When are we going to be able to purchase the series three DVDs in the United States? Series four will be starting on PBS soon and it would be nice to watch series three on our regular TV. Is it up to the producers of this show to make series three available or is there another reason why series three isn't becoming available in the U.S.?,1253232000,7,475,4.288888888888889

The characters in these series are so real and natural, it is really refreshing and extremely enjoyable.  We are really looking forward to seeing more of Martin Clunes as 'Doc Martin;' he is fabulous! It would be absolutely wonderful if these could be made in Region 1 format soon after they are released in Region 2, PAL format.

2968463,2,B000WGTD82,"I have just gotten as far as season 4; initially is was very humorous, but I probably won't finish the series. Clearly I am in the minority with a two-star rating, but nevertheless it just isn't funny anymore. The two main reasons are, first: this is not a program for animal lovers. Of course I know that no animals were actually mistreated or injured, but I cannot find anything funny about kicking a dog, even if it is just going through the motions. Some of the other scenes with animals are also in poor taste and it is disappointing that the accidental destruction of two rare birds is offered as humor. Second, I cannot find entertainment in insulting patients, telling them to shut up, and again, disrespect being passed off as humor.  Maybe it's the election results, but I think I've had enough toxicity and vulgarity to last a while, although it looks like we're in for 4 years of it.  Perhaps I'll try Doc Martin another time.",1483228800,,938,4.5773809523809526

Episode 3 ""The Admirer"" had a piece of erotica that was so stunningly antithetical to the great balance of sensibility and wonderful humor that this work consistently achieves.  In fact I could hardly believe my eyes!  Let's face it, adult themes are a part of life and they have been so skillfully developed by the producers with such great humor and restraint in many of episodes we have watched.  But the utterly distasteful portrayal of the Doc's elderly aunt's sexual proclivities amounted to nothing but cheap imagery.  Very poor lack of judgement regardless of the artistic license imagined.  In the Doc's own words ""you [producers] were stupid"".",1461024000,2,878,4.898648648648648

I do enjoy that there are several story lines in each episode.  What I absolutely did not enjoy as I started over at the beginning over and over again is that I noticed that although the Doc is pompous and rude and is a social misfit, there is some humanity to his character.  The last few seasons have totally lost that bit of humanity and his character turns into a man who is just plain mean with very few moments of heartfelt moments.  He also has changed his voice into something ""old"" and constantly clearing his throat also like an old man.  I would love to see that crabby disinterested and rude doctor again who does have some humanity within him someplace and has not turned into a 90 year old man that absolutely never removes that suit jacket.  Early on although he preferred to always wear a suit, he did at times remove the outer jacket.  The kitchen apron over the suit jacket?  Too much....Get better Mister Clunes (Season 6)  and get that weight back on.  Your personality leaves you as a very handsome and desirable man indeed.

2968902,5,B000WGTD82,"With the advent of Series 3, ""Doc Martin"" continues to be both my husband and my favorite television series.  The only hard part of watching this program is that it is filmed every two years and waiting is not something that comes easy in an age of instant gratification.  On the other hand, when the wait is rewarded with something of the caliber of this show, I have learned to wait with good grace.

Martin Clunes is outstanding as the grumpy surgeon who is forced to work as a backwater doctor in this gorgeous sleepy town due to his own issues with the sight of blood (he vomits uncontrollably.)  He is now seeing a plus in living in the small town as his infatuation with Louisa (Caroline Catz) the school mistress grows by leaps and bounds.  The good doctor has next to zero social skills and has a tendency to say exactly what he is thinking regardless of the consequences or hurt that might be inflicted.  Actually, he doesn't seem to understand that his words have consequences - but that is all part of the fun.

The cast of this show is outstanding.  Each of the individuals has a quirky personality and can, on their own, command your attention by the sheer force of their excellent acting abilities.

I recommend the show to one and all - it is warm and funny and just simply good to watch.",1424736000,,1304,4.445378151260504

It doesn't matter what type of week that I have had, every stress and concern go by the wayside as we set up our little party with popcorn, cheese and crackers, and a glass or two of our favorite wine.  I hope all involved in this production realize that the mental and emotional state of those who watch this ongoing series is riding on their shoulders!  There are yet so many story lines that they could explore and go beyond series seven, of which will get me through the dreadful winter.  Perhaps the writers and producer will read this and hear my plea!  Please continue with this...as you have demonstrated time and time again, your authentic and creative flow.  Also note, it wouldn't hurt to let us peer in a little more to the attraction and utter adornment that both Martin and Louisa have for each other.  It would be natural to have them connect each episode and still face the challenges of his decreased social awareness.

It is typical English humor at it's best mixing up a straight laced doctor who lived in this beautiful setting as a child but spent too much time in London becoming a top notch surgeon.  He goes back to a rural practice for vague reasons but resents it all the same.  It is a lot of fun for anyone over about 8.  His love interest (on again, off again) is a school teacher who just can't believe how stuffy the ""Doc"" can be socially and romantically.

2968988,5,B000WGTD82,"Season 3 Of ""Doc Martin"" is as bracingly funny as the previous seasons, with even stronger character development. Martin and Louisa continue to misunderstand and frustrate each other endearingly (the last episode of this season is simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking). Police Officer Penhale joins the cast and fits in seamlessly, and the relationship between Pauline and Al Large blooms. The acting is uniformly impeccable - these fine actors create fully realized characters.

BUT...an unwelcome surprise to anyone who, like me, was watching Seasons 1-5 for free as a Prime membership benefit. The first week of September 2014 those seasons went from free to pay overnight, with no warning. When I protested to Amazon, it refunded the charge for the first episode I watched after the change and explained that ""the video availability on our Prime catalog depend on our agreements with content owners. Due to these agreements few of the videos are not available for streaming on prime. The movies and TV shows that are currently available for our Prime Instant Video service may change from time to time depending on our agreements with content owners.""

We found ourselves first accepting, then overlooking, and finally loving them, warts and all, for behavior we'd immediately dismiss people for in today's disposable, I-need-no-one-world. And perhaps that's the underlying theme of the show. Despite the Doc's behavior, he is devoted to Louisa and expertly cares for the villagers of Port Wen. We've come to cheer him on and wish him well. It's a sweet, gentle series, with just the right mix of humor, pathos, pratfalls and gore.",1408752000,,603,5.101010101010101

The entire cast is outstanding. Every character seems so real, you might well expect to meet them if you ever visited Portwenn/Port Isaac in Cornwall England. Filmed on location in Port Isaac, the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. I've enjoyed watching the show evolve over the years. It's been a hit since day 1. My only regret is that there are only roughly 12 episodes every year or so. But in a world where TV series come and go in a flash, this one endures because of the overall high quality from cast to location to characters to story lines.",1408579200,,725,4.584615384615384

We went ahead and continued to watch a few more episodes each evening.  We are glad that we stuck with it.  We have gotten to know the characters and the 'quirks' of Doc Martin and enjoyed the series a great deal.  Thus far the episodes have brought us many laughs and a few tears.

2969331,5,B000WGTD82,"The acting is so real, that after watching several seasons of this program I found myself talking to someone and actually having the same facial expressions as the character, Doc Martin!  I had not realized that I had been so immersed in this program.

The photography is beautiful and relaxing. The characters make you care about them. The situations while comical are also poignant and meaningful; and by following along with the story it is cathartic and helps you to release your own stresses.

I particularly like that even though there are continuing issues through the series, that each episode and each series moves forward towards positive improvements for it's characters...improovements that each of us could use in our own lives. And seeing someone do it on the screen in a small way, helps us have a little more courage to do it for ourselves.

Doc Martin, the main hero of the series, is a doctor with such poor social skills, and his own worst enemy in finding love...who  shows as the series progresses, that he had been mentally abused and abandoned by both of his self-centered, unloving parents...and it develops that this might have caused him to become closed, cold and self-centered. Then we see his yearning, his admiration of the beauty of the woman he has become to love, the pain caused by his ineptness (and it is wonderful to watch extremely good actors (Mr. Clunes is only one of many) show this without words...but just the look of their eyes in an almost immobile face, as IF we can read their minds) and his desire to release his heart and breathe deeply of the warmth of life...instead of just the coldness of facts.

Just everything is done right in this series.

Almost every home, or business is real looking. The dish detergent is out on the sink, the door has stains where the hands have touched too many times. The houses have old furniture and they don't look like they are out of magazines. (I hate it when series show everyone's house as if it has just been cleaned, or is strategically messy, and the furniture either looks like it was just bought, or brought from Salvation Army.)

The people wear their same clothes, as if each actor had their own closet of clothes that they use again and again.  (I hate it when I watch a series and I wonder how they have new clothes for each and every episode...and then try to convince me the episode is real to life.)

The medical knowledge is DEAD ON! Absolutely right. And there is enough of really neat medical info that most of the audience can use to help them in their own or their family's lives. (I hate watching shows where the medical info is just plain nonsense, poorly pronounced, and poorly preformed.)

It IS addicting. But luckily, only the most current series...which I think may be SIX, you have to buy. If you have a Prime membership the other seasons are free.  I have overindulged, and watched ALL the seasons...even when I had to pay. Now I am suffering withdrawal, and while I wish for the future seasons.

I am surprised to find that I enjoy watching the old seasons over and over again...and it is not just me but my spouse too, who feels this way.  I understand that is what is called, ""layering"".  Which means, so much, and so many details, and so many issues are layered on top of each other, that each time you watch; you see more, that you did not see last time.",1405814400,,3375,4.57379767827529

2969420,5,B000WGTD82,"I am very new to the Doc Martin series and so enjoying watching all seasons.  Doc Martin is a character like no other.  He says it like it is, no nonsense, truly not very likable, but he still wins you over.  I particularly liked the last episode of Season 3.  You probably don't need to watch them in a row, but it does help get to know the characters.  My only criticism is that sometimes characters suddenly are not on the show anymore and have been replaced, such as Doc Martin's office assistant or the town policeman.",1403395200,,523,4.350515463917525
2969421,5,B000WGTD82,"Watching the cast work so well together is a wonderful British treat!

2969458,5,B000WGTD82,"I caught a couple of episodes of season 6 recently on public television and was very intrigued by the characters and their situations. I got the first season to see what the heck was going on and who was whom and how they are related and I have been binge watching the early seasons whenever I get the chance. Even though there are numerous forehead thumping moments because of the bumbling and general ineptitude of the denizens of this small Cornish town, the characters and stories are endearing and I find myself pulling for them and looking forward to the next installment. Hence the train wreck analogy--sometimes I can barely stand to watch because I just know someone is going to do something silly and it will need to be fixed, and can't look away because it always (well mostly always) gets fixed and I look forward to the next bit of suspense that will accompany the next silliness.",1402876800,,893,4.622641509433962
2969459,5,B000WGTD82,"I truly enjoy Doc Martin.  You love to hate him or hate to love him.  And all the characters  and their stories are fun and interesting to watch.  Good acting and good story line. Hope it stays on for a long time.

British drama at its best.",1401753600,,320,4.262295081967213
2969507,5,B000WGTD82,I love this show!! The people of Portwhen become like friends. Doc martin never fails to have me yelling at him for his rude behavior.

2969510,5,B000WGTD82,This has got to be one of my favorite series from the UK. Love the different characters and their small village viewpoint. Looks like the doc has a tender side with some romantic capabilities. The Large's have transitioned into new careers away from plumbing. The village constable has changed and this one has his own personal issues. Looks like the village chemist has a hidden husband but continues to be enamored with the doc....who is mostly oblivious to her interest. Starting the next season this week.,1401667200,,509,4.930232558139535

2969513,5,B000WGTD82,As is season 1 and 2  season 3 does not disapoint the veiwers. Martin Clue is brlliant at turning into the grumpy and ever so slightly human doctor. The scenery is lovley and the towns people as funny as it gets.,1401408000,,212,4.170731707317073

Even the baby steels your heart as all the characters do. If I had one movie and only one I would pick Doc Martin. We have bought all of the series and I understand they are filming a new series now. I sure hope they are. I will certainly be the first to buy them. Thank you Martin Clunes for making this series. P.S. Lets not forget the dogs in the series. They are perfect. The little one is so adorable. I told my husband  I would love to have him. The larger dog is also a sweetie. Of course, the Doc detests them in such a funny way.",1401321600,,698,4.0215827338129495
2969537,5,B000WGTD82,"We started binge watching this show after my wife had been watching the Spanish version for awhile. i really like the original...it has that dry British humor I've loved since i was a kid, plus there's some interesting insights into the British medical system that i hope aren't a foreshadow of the years to come here in the US.

if you like British shows in general, or you liked 'House MD', this one is for you!",1401235200,,413,4.434210526315789

I never watched it on PBS and only found Doc Martin from browsing Prime Instant Video.  I started with Season 1 and just now finished Season 3.  One hint- Don't start by watching the Doc Martin Movies, start with the series.

Wonderful characters, funny British humor, and beautiful scenery.  We've seen Season 1 and 2 on television, and with my husband out of town, I decided to purchase the 3rd season so I could binge watch it on my Kindle.  And BTW, I LOVE watching movies on the Kindle.  The HD picture is wonderful and I don't even realize I'm watching on a small screen.  Anyhow, Season 3 is awesome.  I could watch Doc Martin and the fun characters who populate Portwenn forever.  Martin Clunes is fabulous.  I've mentioned the series to a couple of friends, who've not heard of it, and they promised to watch it.  I know they'll love it.",1400630400,,786,4.50354609929078

He doesn't beat around the bush and tells it as it is.  I like his direct style.  The series has a lot of interesting people and is very enjoyable.  Several of the characters are in every episode but each episode will have one or two people show up just for that episode.  They are usually a little strange or have some kind of strange quirk that Doc deals with.  I'm looking forward to seeing season 4, 5, and any others that are available on Amazon, as I do not get the local PBS station over the air.",1396656000,,645,4.031496062992126

Dr. Martin is a mess but a likeable one. Sometimes he is a little severe and needs to lighten up some. You just keep waiting for that to happen and then he lets you down. Hopefully someday he will soften up some. You know he cares because he saves peoples lives and gets angry when they don't take care of themselves but he is missing the soft side. I guess you would say we are just waiting! But, if it ever happens will it be the end? Hopefully not. We will go on to the next Season. All of the episodes are very entertaining. We haven't been let down yet. Thanks for the show.",1396656000,,746,4.109589041095891
2969845,5,B000WGTD82,My husband and I both love this series.  You've just got to love the irascible Doc Martin.  The story takes some unexpected twists here and there but we most enjoy the variety of oddly endearing characters living in the village and those who seem slightly odder living in the countryside.  Always entertaining.,1396569600,,310,4.923076923076923

2969847,5,B000WGTD82,"One of my favorites, to say the least!  What makes this so funny for me at least is this is exactly how people are with a few theatrics thrown in for good measure.  To see them all in such a small village just adds to the humor and irony.  Well written, well cast and bloody well done!!",1396483200,,286,3.982456140350877

2970112,5,B000WGTD82,"Doc Martin is another wonderful PBS series.  Dr. Ellingham, called Doc Martin by the locals, is an extremely intelligent man with no bedside manner. At times he seems rude and arrogant, but he devotes himself to improving health and saving lives in a small coastal village. Only gradually do we find out about his narcissistic parents and a childhood marred by a lack of true affection.  We pull for him to find love, intimacy, and empathy that was so missing in his childhood. Infused with humor, we also cheer on the local folks as well. The acting is very fine.",1392768000,,564,4.63

I am part of the horde that enjoys Downtown Abbey, but this series is everything that Downton Abbey is not - i.e., original, humorous and filled with flawed, authentic characters of normal height/weight proportion.

The one thing I have a problem with is following the conversation at times.  The actors talk low or fast and I can't understand what they are saying - but maybe I just have a hearing problem.

He is socially awkward and is in love with the local headmistress! Whenever an intimate moment arises, he ruins it by launching into a medical explanation ( I.e. When they kiss for the first time after spending the entire night in the hospital with a sick patient, he tells her she has bad breath and begins to expound on the importance of personal hygiene!) despite his awkwardness and his propensity for saying the wrong thing, he does care about his patients and  will follow up if he thinks something is amiss!

This all makes for a series that is always good for lots of laughs.  But the good doctor also has a tender side that he occasionally exhibits, which shows that he is still very human.  A great series.",1389398400,,372,4.765625

2970567,4,B000WGTD82,"Great show.  But not 5 stars just because there is always room for improvement.  This story is quirky fun, really unexpected, and you never know what is coming next.  The doc is a harmless oddball who really tries to do his best, but refuses to be like everyone else.  The rest of the village just has a time getting used to him and accepting that he has the most unusual manner.

Clunes plays is so opposite of his true personality that it must be physically tiring to play the role of such a serious and grumpy person.
My only complaint is that we have to wait too long between series. I can't wait until we can see Series 6 here in the states. I hope there will be a Series 7!",1382486400,,575,4.284403669724771

2970620,5,B000WGTD82,"I am collecting this entire series and each one is better than the last.  The show is so entertaining and keeps me wondering what will happen next.  Great entertainment, great acting.",1381622400,,183,4.870967741935484
2970621,5,B000WGTD82,The humor is terrific! I have to watch on Amazon and wish our local station carried it! Keep it coming!,1381104000,,103,4.2
2970622,5,B000WGTD82,"Doc Martin brilliant English comedy. Sense of dry humor is evident or well prescribe by the ""Doc"". All you do is fall in love with him and the cast of characters. Brilliant comedy - cheers",1380844800,,188,4.4
2970623,5,B000WGTD82,"I find the Martin character oddly compelling.  Although it would seem there is nothing on the surface to make him likeable, I kept
tuning in to see just a glimpse of the good guy beneath.  Those glimpses of his brilliance as a doctor along with his struggle to
be anything more than just a shadow of what all the other towns people would choose, keeps me interested and not at all bored.
Clunes would appear to be masterfully playing a rather two dimensional character that makes us want to see those rare moments
where what we hope for shines through.",1380844800,,552,4.51
2970624,5,B000WGTD82,"Very ""Northern Exposure"" like with strong development of individual characters. A really excellent and funny show. I would recommend it to many.",1380844800,,144,5.590909090909091
2970625,5,B000WGTD82,A must see show. Very entertaining. Excellent cast and content. Martin Clunes plays his role with precision with a wonderful cast to back him up. Oscar material.,1380499200,,161,5.0
2970646,5,B000WGTD82,Great program as was season 1 and 2!  Very well done - acting is excellent and I particularly enjoy the scenic English countryside as well as the visits into the homes and businesses of the characters on the show.  I watch the show on my Kindle and use earphones.  And that is far better than on a larger screen as it is a far more intimate experience.,1380412800,,352,4.223880597014926
2970647,5,B000WGTD82,"I had never heard of this series before I found it on my kindle.  I have amazon prime, so it was a free stream.  I began watching it at season 2 because for some reason I couldn't locate season one.  I was hooked from the first few minutes and have watched all the episodes through season 5.  Since then I've found the first season and will watch it soon.

This series is so good--quirky, funny, winsome, endearing, blunt & surprising.  I would recommend this for anyone looking to escape from the nastiness and unpleasantness of  what's going on in the world today.  It will transport you to a village in England where time seems to have stopped, although everyone has cell phones and computers--but the pace of life is slower, everyone knows everyone else and watches out for them, the scenery is breathtaking, and you'll come away feeling like you're part of the community.",1380240000,,876,4.642857142857143
2970648,4,B000WGTD82,We have really enjoyed the program.  It is fun to see how doc deals with various situations and his own brusque personality.  The commedy is clean and void of foul language that other programs feel they must provide.  The plot is intriguing and invites one to see the next episode.,1380153600,,281,4.58

2970650,5,B000WGTD82,"I'm an american that has fallen in love with Doc Martin.  Martin Clunes and cast makes the show believable - almost like they are your next door neighbors.  This IS a much different role for Martin Clunes to the other Doc Martin movies, as he was kinder and gentler in those but the Series puts Doc Martin in a new light.  Clunes does a wonderful job with his grumpy doctoring manners and his almost boyish love for Louisa.

Each series gets better and better.  Something you'll watch over and over and over.",1379808000,,508,4.478260869565218

2970653,2,B000WGTD82,"Too much over the top in several episodes, (for example: the episode where the young man is ""going at it"" on the kitchen table with Doc Martin's aunt - an elderly woman).

Very disrespectful not only to the viewer, but also to women in general and elderly women in particular.  If I wanted to watch that kind of ""crap,"" I'd tune in to the vast wasteland of American television.",1379376000,3,377,4.449275362318841
2970654,5,B000WGTD82,"I had no idea that I would enjoy this series. I would make fun of the show not expecting to become captured but all the characters of Port Wenn.

2970677,5,B000WGTD82,"I previously rated Seasons 1 & 2 of this show as among the best entertainment being broadcast.  In all honesty, I thought that there was a slight drop off in the story lines for Season 3, so I would probably have rated it with 4.5 stars were that possible.  However, since half-stars are not an option, I chose to give it 5, rather than 4, stars.  Why?  Because despite my feeling that Season 3 wasn't quite as good as its predecessors in terms of story lines, the acting and overall production in this series is still superb, and my wife and I really can't wait to start viewing Season 4.

2970746,4,B000WGTD82,Doc Martin shows his personal relationship skills. He really does miss the mark. The rudeness is actually the lack of thoughtful consideration for others. This we find out is his personality created during his youth. All in all the TV show tastefully creates Doc Martin. This is a very funny show. This sort of deadpan humor is very rare in American TV.,1376524800,,353,4.709677419354839

Of course, he is terribly rude, guess because of the conditions he has which affects his relationship with people.  I hated the episode where his aunt and the younger man got together.  It was repulsive.  I will keep watching if those types of situations do not reoccur.  People need humor and less reality.

The sole physician in town has absolutely no bed-side manner, but the way he deals with his patients (very abrupt and rude) takes you by surprise and you can't help but laugh out loud.  Every now and then you get a glimpse of him that shows he really does care about the people around him, in-spite of the outward appearances.

2970831,5,B000WGTD82,Doc Martin is best enjoyed by starting with Season 1 and working forward with each episode.  The people that populate the village to which Doc Martin has moved are a wonderful group to play off of his odd personality.  It is great fun to see how all of their relationships develop.  My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed each season that we have watched.,1374710400,,357,4.546875

2970852,4,B000WGTD82,The characters in this story are perplexing but I suppose that is what it's like to live in a place like Portwenn.  It's fun to see how they continually cope with frustration.,1374364800,,175,4.46875

2970854,5,B000WGTD82,Watching Doc Martin navigate his way through the small English village he has set up practice in is like watching a prince coming to live under the flyover with the lot there.  I love fish-out-of-water stories and this is such a good one.,1374105600,,238,4.534883720930233

2970893,5,B000WGTD82,"I lucked onto this series a few months ago when I saw a rerun of it on BBC America.  I love the quirky characters, the on again, off again relationship of the Doc & ""Louiser"".  And some of the situations with the village's characters make me & my husband just laugh out loud!

It's easy to go from episode to episode with my Amazon Prime instant streaming, which I think is just great.

There isn't anything I dislike about the series or the service.  I have recommended it to many of my friends.",1373587200,,496,4.290322580645161

2970927,5,B000WGTD82,"Our neighbors put us on to this and we love the series! Fun, quirky characters and beautiful location. How did they film it without the rain?

We are part way through Season 3 and will be sad when we are all done with the series.",1373414400,,336,4.184615384615385
2970928,5,B000WGTD82,The very best and most refreshing series on tv.  Characters  are real and adorable  as is the dog who  makes himself at home in the  Doc's office.  I've enjoyed every Season and look forward to the next  one hundred !,1373414400,,217,4.275
2970929,5,B000WGTD82,The characters are a hoot - quirky but you just have to love them.  A good show to watch when you need a chuckle and to just relax and admire the human spirit.  Can't take things too seriously - neither does this show.,1373328000,,218,4.046511627906977
2970930,5,B000WGTD82,"Dr. Martin Ellingham is a curmudgeon!  Sometimes you see the word loveable preceding curmudgeon but he is seldom loveable.  He would have been much better suited for his chosen profession as a surgeon in London.  Unfortunately, he developed an aversion to blood which forced him to relocate as a GP to a small fishing village in Cornwall.  The episodes revolve around the down to earth (more often quirky) residents of the village and their relationship to Doc Martin and each other.  There's Martin's organic farmer aunt Joan; the village plumber turned restaurateur and his handsome son; Martin's pretty, smart sometimes less than efficient receptionist; the married village pharmacist & her husband who works on an oil rig; the narcoleptic, agoraphobic village policeman; and the head teacher at the village school (Martin's off again-on again love interest).  The story lines are very well written and usually bring in new characters from outside the village for variety.  There are 5 seasons and I will be very sad when I get to the end!",1373328000,,1042,5.058479532163743
2970931,5,B000WGTD82,This is one of the best TV shows ever made!  It will make you laugh out loud and nearly bring you to tears -- the writing is simply superb.  The final episode of season one is probably the best television ever -- but the entire series is worth watching.,1373241600,,253,4.142857142857143
2970932,5,B000WGTD82,I started watching this program on local PBS TV station. I then discovered the free episodes for Amazon Prime members. I have watched the entire Season 3 series on Amazon. The humor is dry but so entertaining. Each episode has some serious moments as well.  It is hard to believe that a person who is dedicated to caring for others can be so rude while doing so. Doc Martin is such a person. Everyone in this village has issues. I absolutely love this program. I am ecstatic that this program and many others are free to Amazon Prime members. This is not a paid for review. I have saved so much being a Prime member. Now I get to watch good programs as well on my laptop or on my Kindle HD.,1373068800,,690,4.2272727272727275

2971001,4,B000WGTD82,"The British truly have a different outlook on life than we Americans and I am intrigued by Doc Martin's rudeness and anti-social behavior but frankly irritated by it as well.  How could any physician have so little ""bedside manner""?  Also this is advertised as a comedy and even though there are comedic moments, it is primarily a drama and a frustrated romance show.

 The scenery and the supporting cast are quaint and attractive to me to the extent that my next visit to the British Isles will include Cornwall.  It is interesting to watch Doc Martin's personality soften a bit as the episodes move on and I am anxious to watch his bumbling romance move on.  As I said I am intrigued and therefore continue to watch.  The characters Pauline and Aunt Joan are particularly fun to watch.  I love that I can watch it on PBS or online streaming WITH NO COMMERCIALS.  That alone is worth a lot.",1370390400,,892,4.559748427672956

2971091,5,B000WGTD82,Doc Martin initially is the guy you want to dislike... but soon you will grow to love him. Very different charactors all around. Will make you laugh out loud.,1366329600,,158,4.482758620689655

2971093,3,B000WGTD82,We really like this show and look forward to watching it after dinner every day. Visually terrific. Our only problem is that we have to run sound at 100% and still miss some of the dialogue. Its the only show that causes us to have this problem.,1366329600,,245,4.23404255319149
2971094,5,B000WGTD82,"Finally, a TV serial I really like. The cast is great. Love their accent and mannerism. Also like the idea of living in a village like Portwen.  Thanks!",1366329600,,152,4.428571428571429
2971095,4,B000WGTD82,"While Louisa and Doc become closer, the overtone of them never getting together becomes redundant in this particular season. It becomes more problematic when they become intimate.

At the same time, his relationship with his Aunt becomes even more intriguing as he walks in on her ""In flagrante delicto"" having sex on a table with an artist 20 years her junior. As they work through the issue and as he deals with multiple issues of ethics and privacy, you see him in a different light.

Al Large returns in this season - with his own secrets and problems.

A mixed bag - some good, some bad, but all Doc Martin.",1366070400,,612,4.545454545454546

2971123,5,B000WGTD82,"I live in Oklahoma, so the first thing I look for in a series is being able to understand the actors when they speak their lines.  So, aside from the fact that I like the main character in Doc Martin, I know what he's saying.",1364515200,,225,4.0
2971154,5,B000WGTD82,If you haven't watched the Doc Martin series you have missed a great deal of fun.  After the very first episode I just could not wait for PBS to slowly unveil the rest of the series.  I ordered every series and have watched them all a few times over with the same amount of enjoyment as the first one.  Now I wait for Series  6 whch is promised in the fall of 2013.  If you watched All Creatures Great and Small you will love this updated version of quirky characters in a small coastal town and the doctor who takes care of them all. This all takes place in 2003 and after so it is much more up to date than All Creatures which showed life before WW11 in a small town.  Those who wonder how the National Health Service works in England would do well to take notice but naturally our particular hero goes above and beyond.  Never-the-less the basic care is there since the doctor gets paid by the number of patients on his register rather than how many times he see each patient.,1364428800,,979,4.231182795698925

2971160,5,B000WGTD82,"I enjoyed every new psychological twist and unexpected event.....this is a delightful series.  Watching the story unfold is a lark, but it also provides real insight into the minds of folks with ""special"" ways of thinking, and allows the viewer to experience their frustrations, as well those of the people who love them.",1364169600,,321,5.056603773584905
2971161,5,B000WGTD82,Excellent entertainment.  I love British comedy and would recommend this to everyone.  Nothing beats Doc Martin's overall demeanor for a chuckle.,1364083200,,145,5.857142857142857
2971162,5,B000WGTD82,"Doc Martin is a bit like the TV series House, but Doc Martin can elicit empathy for his shortcommings. You want him  to succeed in his relationships. He has a bad bedside manner and is rude but he really  cares for his patients. He is an amazing Doctor with many problems. The show is set in  a small fishing village and the scenery is very pleasing to look at and the cast very talented. When you care for the characters in a show you know it is well written and played. Great Show... Love every minute of it!",1363737600,,510,4.183673469387755

2971187,5,B000WGTD82,"My wife told me about the Doc Martin series after seeing some episodes on TV.  I found the series on my Kindle Fire and am now hooked on them.  The British seem to know how to create high quality TV series with interesting, quirky characters who find themselves in interesting, amusing and thought-provoking situations.  Being a physician, I can identify with some of Martin's Asperger symptoms.  Even though many of the characters' quirks are off-the-wall, I think that viewers can see some of those traits in themselves.  It's something like looking at yourself in a mirror.  Now my wife is watching all of the series on the Kindle Fire, and I must fight her for it.",1363737600,,668,4.7155172413793105

2971192,5,B000WGTD82,"I started watching this series by accident.  It was just on when nothing else was on tv.
I enjoyed it so much that I bought the first season, then watched the second season on PBS.  The third season is even better than expected.
Doc Martin starts out as a hemophobic surgeon moving to a country practice in the Village of Port Wen.  He tries to survive as a family practitioner with no people skills.  With his abrasive personality he manages to insult everyone he comes in contact with.  The results are hilarious, and after a couple of episodes you really care about the characters.
Well done, It's a great place to escape.",1363219200,,625,4.544642857142857
2971193,5,B000WGTD82,I discovered Doc Martin a couple of months ago and just love this series.  The characters are just so unique.  I was glad to read that more episodes will be filmed this year.,1363219200,,174,4.242424242424242
2971224,5,B000WGTD82,Humorous and touching series.  VERY good actors and and excellent production. For me it rivals MASH as a series. Clunes and Catz are BRILLIANT.,1363219200,,143,4.958333333333333

With life the way it is, all the stress and worry over things we have little or no power to change life gets ""heavy"".  An episode of Martin is what my husband and I end our day with.  Better than any drug, hot milk, or knock on the head. Try it, I PROMISE you won't regret it!!!",1362787200,,413,4.285714285714286
2971230,5,B000WGTD82,"Otherwise, you will be really annoyed with yourself for spending time watching this grumpy guy--the brilliant surgeon who, alas, is almost completely lacking in interpersonal skills.  Like House on this side of the Atlantic, Doc Martin is rather, well, flawed as a human being, despite being extraordinarily competent as a physician.  Along with his brusque demeanor, he is also hemophobic--yep, a doctor who cannot be in the presence of blood without throwing up.  What makes this series delightful is not so much the rude doctor, but the populace of the village in which he is the authorized physician.  A flock of those quite talented actors so common to the British make the doc's life more complicated--and the audience's experience more entertaining.  As I've commented in other reviews of this series, I suspect viewers either love this guy or cannot stand him.  The number of stars I have given my rating tells you where I fall.",1362614400,,936,5.006451612903226

2971248,5,B000WGTD82,"The thing that is so good about the Doc Martin series is the way that it tenderly depicts the foibles of all of the characters.  Things go wrong in the most amazing ways, and yet there is a resilience to the characters and the insight that, in the end, they all rely on each other.  Season 3 shows the developing relationship between Doc Martin and Louisa Glasson amid the backdrop of all of the crazy goings-on of the Port Wenn crew.

Best to watch it from the beginning.it's about an English surgeon who has to give up operating ( I won't spoil the reason why), and takes a job as a general practitioner in a small village.  The doctor has poor social skills and the series is about Doc Martin slowly fitting in (or not) with the village. The other characters are great. Love the pharmacist and the police officers. Of course there is a love interest with many twists and turns. A few of the doctors relatives appear throughout the series-they are interesting characters.  And good news! I read recently that there will be a season 6! Thoroughly enjoyed this series. It was free with amazon instant video, so if you have that, give this series a try.",1361836800,,862,4.484076433121019

2971340,5,B000WGTD82,"Barely two months after I first viewed the first episode, ""Doc Martin"" has now become one of my favorite productions ever, movie or television.  In fact, it's hard to think of a better production that I've seen in decades of television and movie viewing -- the outstanding comedy and drama of ""Doc Martin"" are that good.  Five stars are hardly enough for a program that produces this kind of enjoyment.

I've now watched all of the currently existing episodes through Series 5, and in my opinion, ""Doc Martin"" sustains its very high level of quality throughout, so I'd recommend the DVDs of all of the seasons.  I can hardly wait for Series 6, which star Martin Clunes has confirmed will be filmed in 2013 and will likely be the last series for the program.

For the uninitiated, the premise of the show is that the rather grouchy, socially inept but brilliant Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes) is taking over as a general practitioner in the picturesque seaside village of Portwenn in southwestern England, after leaving his London surgical practice when he develops a blood phobia.  Schoolteacher Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz) is one of the few villagers who appreciates Martin's good qualities -- she understands that his social rudeness disguises a man who actually cares for other people in a very literal way.  A romance results, creating a running thread through all of the seasons, although there are significant setbacks along the way.

Martin and Louisa are joined by plumber/restauranteur Bert Large (Ian McNeice) and his son/business partner Al (Joe Absolom); Martin's Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole), who runs a small, struggling family farm by herself; later on, Martin's Aunt Ruth (Dame Eileen Atkins), a psychiatrist; a series of quirky receptionists in the doctor's office, with Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) as the longest-serving and most memorable; the village pharmacist, Mrs. Tishell (Selina Cadell), who has a lasting crush on Martin; and two successive village police officers, Mark Mylow (Stewart Wright) and Joe Penhale (John Marquez), who share some well-meaning comic ineptitude with Mayberry's Barney Fife.

Both the acting and the writing on ""Doc Martin"" contain considerable depth.  My wife and I knew we were seeing something unusually good when, after each episode, we began discussing the characters' motivations, how their family backgrounds affected their personalities, and what those characters might have been doing while they were off-stage as a logical prelude to their on-stage actions.  Now, obviously, we know that these are fictional characters who don't really have family backgrounds and aren't really doing anything when they're not in a scene.  But the actors and the writers have created characters with so many dimensions that there is something very real about them -- it makes the viewer care about what they're going through now and wonder what's going to happen to them next.  To me, this is the ultimate success for a dramatic production: to create its own reality, one that the audience cares about.  All of the actors noted above and, of course, the writers have a great deal to be proud of here.

As you might guess, almost every program contains medical problems for Martin to deal with, ranging from routine but sometimes funny ailments to life-threatening emergencies -- that's the life of the only doctor in a small village.  But this isn't really a show about medicine, even though the main character is a medical doctor, it's a comedy/drama about a wide variety of people with a wide variety of things going on in their lives -- from Aunt Joan's financial problems on the farm to the Larges' business setbacks to the romantic yearnings of PC Mark Mylow.  But although the group of characters (and actors) here is outstanding, I wouldn't call this a true ensemble drama, because the series focuses on Martin, who is undoubtedly the main character -- this is his story, even though the other characters' stories are told as well.  As the show progresses, Louisa comes to share that focus because her relationship with Martin becomes so important to the show.  In this aspect, there's a certain similarity to ""Pride and Prejudice,"" I think, because both stories involve a romance, long in developing, between a very good-natured, sensible, and highly competent woman and a rather rude, haughty, but worthwhile man who needs someone to humanize him.  Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz constantly impress with the meaning they bring to these roles with their brilliantly subtle characterizations.  Small, almost unnoticed expressions often convey worlds of feeling.

(The Martin-Louisa romance has really caught the public imagination, apparently.  In an LA Times interview, Martin Clunes says that ""[a] boy came up and asked me for my autograph, followed by an old man who said, 'I don't want your autograph but just marry that girl before I die, willya?' That seems to sum up the level at which it hits people."")

But I'm not trying to downplay the other characters, and the excellent actors who portray them.  They're all a very important part of this show's considerable charm, and they all have their turns (sometimes numerous turns) as the center of different subplots in particular episodes.  These subplots can be either comic or dramatic for particular characters, rather than being only one or the other, again showing the depth of the writing and acting.  For example, Bert and Al Large, who are usually involved in rather funny situations, also deal with more serious family issues and business problems. PC Joe Penhale, a classic well-meaning bumbler, also has a sad encounter with his ex-wife.  And even when a character doesn't have his/her own plotline, that person very ably supports the characters who do.

While there's certainly a good deal of drama in these programs, the laughs shouldn't be overlooked.  The Larges, the police officers, the receptionists, and Mrs. Tishell all provide much humor -- as does Martin himself, whose disdainful reactions to the villagers are often very funny.

This story of an emotionally stunted man has the potential to create an abundance of emotion in its audience, because most viewers, I think, will care about these characters, laughing at their foibles and commiserating with their sorrows.  I give it my highest recommendation.  I would guess that most people who see just a few of the early episodes will, like me, want to see all of them, perhaps multiple times.",1346889600,,6482,5.09640831758034
2971341,5,B000WGTD82,This was a very good series. I wish it was longer or had a part two or something. Surely there is more to add to the story? What becomes of Al for instance?,1341360000,,156,3.757575757575758
2971342,3,B000WGTD82,"Even though the writing for this series seems a bit obvious and the character somewhat one dimensional, the townspeople and the doctor himself begin to grow on you and you'll laugh at their predicaments and care what happens to them.

One thing I would have appreciated would have been more continuity.  It seems as if, in many cases, actors have been contracted to work for only one episode or one particular season.  Many patients have conditions which are diagnosed, but we never really know what becomes of them.  This is unsatisfying and curious, as they are mostly permanent residents of this small village.

Also some main character's will be missing abruptly in follow up seasons as if their contract negotiations failed or something.  I didn't particulary care for the 1st season's receptionist, but I really liked the town constable from seasons 1 and 2, but perhaps the new cop from season 3 will be fleshed out more and become more interesting to the viewers.

I thought toward the end of this 3rd season that Martin would take a great step forward while still being his flawed self - we've seen he really cares about his aunt and Luisa- but we'll wait to see if his character grows and develops in a deeper way.  I hope Luisa won't be MIA for the remaining seasons.",1335484800,3,1278,4.699551569506727

2971360,3,B000WGTD82,"Season 3 of Doc Martin still delivers a comedy punch, wrapped in delightful scenery and scenarios. However, unlike Season 2 (the best, IMHO) this season suffers from far-fetched plots. Worse, some of the characters we've come to know & love lose their sparkle and depth. Season 3 will please die-hard Doc Martin fans, but those who appreciate subtle plot and character development will be disappointed.

First (not a spoiler, since it's revealed in episode 1), the greatest loss is that of PC Mark Mylow, played by the wonderful and bewitching Stewart Wright. Unlike Season 2's swapping in of Pauline for Elaine as Doc's receptionist (THANK YOU, writers! Who else couldn't stand Elaine?), PC Penhale is a ho-hum replacement. His character twists through a few plot turns that I found lame. With each episode, I just wanted Mark back. Thank goodness we viewers still get to visit Portwenn's other colorful characters, including Mrs. Tishell (played by Selina Cadell).

A few of the other ""flattened"" characters in this season are Pauline and Auntie Joan. Episode 4 focuses on, ahem, a highly improbable and slightly off-putting aspect of Joan's life (so out of character I wondered if I was hallucinating). In episode 5, Pauline's behavior takes a bizarre turn -- one that's summarily ignored in the rest of the series. It's just... odd, as though the writers don't understand how to make these characters three-dimensional.

Another bittersweet character note: the Large men (Bert and Al) are back -- although Bert's not quite so large anymore! (The DVD's trivia feature reveals that Ian McNeice lost 70 pounds before Season 3 was filmed. It shows.) Their interplay is lovely, and yet I can almost hear the show's creators/writers struggling to provide them with a new set of challenges. By the season's end, they've nearly become caricatures of themselves.

The silver lining, I suppose, is the growing chemistry and interaction between Louisa and Martin. Their relationship gets more traction in this season. Many of the reviews here on Amazon have ruined the ending of the season with their spoilers, which I won't do. However, I'll add that I found the final episode to end in a fitting manner -- it just made sense to me.

In a not incidental note of thanks, Acorn Media can be applauded for continuing to include subtitles for this season (I've had to give up watching British shows because of a lack of subtitles. Sad but true.)

If you're already in love with Doc Martin and the village of Portwenn, nothing I say will stop you from buying Season 3. But consider yourself forewarned: lower your expectations a bit lest you find yourself watching these episodes with a big imaginary ""HUH?"" floating over your head.",1299715200,14,2721,4.9823788546255505

2971385,5,B000WGTD82,"The easiest way to become a Doc Martin fan is to watch a few episodes; that's what happened to us and we're very glad we did. Doc Martin, played by Martin Ellingham, is a most unlikely hero; at first viewing one may wonder why this man was selected to play the part. After just a few minutes he becomes Doc Martin and it's hard to imagine anyone else as the Doc.

Series 3 continues where Series 2 left off with a few minor changes; we have a new PC played by John Marquez. PC Penhale arrives with his own set of dreams and problems with which Doc must deal. Doc's on and off interest in Louisa, played by Caroline Catz, begins to be on more than off.

The beautiful scenery of Port Wenn, played by the Village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, is always a delight; the charm of the village, the narrow streets, and the beauty of the surrounding countryside is very pleasant to the eyes. I have to admit that the narrow streets and roads are interesting to see, but I wouldn't want to drive on them!

This is most like Clatterford in some ways, mainly the townspeople acting like one organism. . Though Clatterford has its own special irony and interwoven commentary on personalities: 1l upper-class unconscious twitness, 2) extreme well duh, super-pop unconscious extra-environmental-or-whatever-you've-got-going-vegetarian-etc.-ness, 3) multiple personality disorder managed by the townspeople.
Clatterford has a certain sophisticated wit and humour.

Whereas Doc Martin is not 'zany' or 'a comedy'. (Unless you're given to ridiculing people.)I'd call it 'light drama'.

Martin is insensitive, inappropriate and brilliant at his work, angry, arrogant, loveable.. He is like some Asperger's types I have known. You can love them, perhaps, but often get hurt feelinngs because they don't know how to treat people.

This is an intelligent series made with no seams. I hurried and ordered the next one as I was getting toward the end of the first.

Review of Series 3
Excellent, mostly. BUT, under no circumstances watch episode 4. Especially, no children under 18 should watch episode 4. It is a downer, regular characters suddenly mis-drawn, and a highly irregular, even traumatizing (to children) subplot. For adults it just leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
There is nothing uplifting or enjoyable about Episode 4, Series 3, nor is there any part of the plot that is advanced by it. It is just wrong conception and annoyingly bad writing.

The views of Cornwall alone would make buying the series worthwhile, but the actors and actresses who comprise the cast are generally superb.
The DVD cover quotes a reviewer as saying it's ""absolutely bloody hilarious"". It's not.

Doc Martin is still very brilliant solving medical problems that plague the little village and its very eccentric (strange) inhabitants.

They don't always escape his insults and barbs; however, they see that very deep inside he is a ""good person"" but you do have to get beyond his gruff exterior which at times is very hard to do.  In spite of a repulsion at the sight of blood (the reason he's no longer a surgeon in London and the reason he's a GP in Portwenn), he's really very medically brilliant and very dedicated--just no bedside manner.

It is of note that one of the two ""new"" episodes ought to have been shown much earlier as it introduces, obviously for the first time, the officious narcoleptic/agoraphobic village policeman we met early on (probably in Series 1) who was later replaced by gentler ""Mark"".",1269302400,13,944,4.371428571428571
2971435,5,B000WGTD82,"I love this series.  You really care about the people and what happens, while laughing all the way.  Clunes is a great actor, shows what's going on inside the character at the same time he's being rude and outrageous outside.",1269129600,,225,4.6
2971436,1,B000WGTD82,"Gratuitous violence toward animals.
Warnng: ""The GP always rings twice"" contains a scene of outlandish disregard for animal life.  The bumbling Doc Martin drives his car over a helpless Yorkie and crushes the small animal to death beneath his 4,000-pound luxury car.  One of the unwritten rules of drama is that you don't kill dumb animals to progress your simplistic and indifferent plot.  Sadists among us already prey upon helpless domesticated animals without the cheer leading and encouragement of TV shows like this.  If the producers have no better sense of proportion and sensitivity,they should be blackballed from ever producing their violent-endorsing drivel on the unsuspecting public again.  Cancel this monstrosity of so-called entertainment before it offends us again.",1268784000,6,783,5.546218487394958
2971437,5,B000WGTD82,"Doc Martin is a cleverly written show that fits the prescription for funny as well as a storyline that will capture your attention.  The writing is far above average, but the characters are brought to us by excellent actors who have developed them into people that you care about and are interested in.  It NEVER fails to delight, please, and touch you in many ways.  Martin Clunes is outstanding as the Doc and is never one dimensional and always on target.  It is a show I never tire of and always look forward to viewing.  Filmed in beautiful Port Issac it is a visually pleasing show. One looks forward to many more refills of this prescription!!",1268611200,,650,4.568965517241379

2971439,5,B000WGTD82,"If you liked Doc Martin seasons 1 and 2, you will LOVE season 3.  The side stories are funnier than previous seasons, and the relationship between the two leads finally moves on a bit.  Martin Clunes once again fills the screen with his subtle, hilarious facial expressions.  And more so than in previous seasons, Caroline Catz gets the chance to display her own perfect comedic timing, and gives Clunes some serious competition in the ""rubber-faced"" department!  The ending isn't what one would hope for, but not to worry...there are eight more episodes to follow in season 4.  Only complaint:  Why did Acorn Media change the episode titles for North America???  Doc Martin has already aired in Canada with the originals.  I found episode five's change from ""The Holly Bears a Prickle"" to ""Breaking Up Is Hard To Do"" especially cheesy. Sorry, but the originals were far more clever and quirky...a much better fit, as Doc Martin itself is best described as the definitive clever and quirky television drama.",1265068800,14,1007,4.9523809523809526
2971440,5,B000WGTD82,"Doc Martin Series 3 is lacking only in quantity of episodes. This is too fun a series to settle for so few. Of course Series 1 & 2 helps. Rude, grumpy Doc (Martin Clunes) vomits at the sight of blood. You'll laugh at the sight of other townsfolk in this serene, beautiful, fictional Portwenn (filmed in Port Isaac, Cornwall). Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole) is sane, almost, as is teacher Louisa (Caroline Cutz). Receptionist and phlebotomist Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) is outrageously funny along with Bert Large (Ian McNeice) and...well the list goes on with the regular cast.

If you love English seaside village views and homespun humor, this is a series that will tickle your fancy, every episode, and make you beg for more. Episodes tend to carry over to the next and all have SUBTITLES. This is some of the best British Doctor's Life Comedy/drama ever produced. The ""Doc Martin Series"" is to Medical Comedy what ""Pie In The Sky"" is to Police Comedy. (See my reviews on both.)

Bonus stuff includes cast filmographies and fun trivia along with subtitles.

For the detail minded:
..1 Tick Tock--Includes Pauline and Louisa seems to be trying to help doctor locals including a girl who jumps on car tops, her overweight mom, the fainting teacher Louisa, overlysleepy new cop, and a blind man with an untrained dog.
..2 The Morning After--Bert large changes from plumber to chef. Scenic Portwenn is hit with widespread food poinsoning, including Louisa, unrequited love to the stiff naive Doc.  A general misdiagnosis also proves to be a huge error in source.
..3 Love Thy neighbor--Louisa's new neighbors, a psychologist, has strange parental practices for their brat son. Conditions run rampant with the cop being agoraphobic (going out fear) & narcoleptic (sleep disorder), and others with rashes, and then there was Doc's blood phobia, & inability to tenderize a relationship with Louisa.
...4 The GP Always Rings Twice--Admirers aplenty in Portwenn. A divorcee pursues Doc. Auntie Joan has 'relations' with a painter. The plumber/chef's son, Al, Pauline's old flame, returns. Then there's Princess Tinkle, she dog.
...5 Breaking Up Is Hard to Do--Pauline's gambling on the internet at the surgery. Doc & Louisa gamble on a real date. And kiss. Nothing's going very well leading up to an unrelated beach accident and a surprise outcome.
...6 The Two of Us--Portwenn engagement news is rampant. Aunt Joan hears by rumor--oops! Large Restaurant struggles as does many with fungus illness.
...7 In Sickness and in Health--A very pregnant bridesmaid shoots her eye with a party popper. The vicar's drinking. The reception patio is flooded. Wedding florist is arrested. The bad news continues on this the wedding day.

Delightful, warm, hilarious, witty, and quick dialogue moves this beautifully filmed series along so fast you'll be disappointed when the complete list of episodes are done. Then, like me, you have to click for a notification of Doc Martin, Series 4.  I think I should go back and repeat Series 1-2-3 in the meantime.",1261526400,60,3036,5.062

Really good television is hard to come by, even on cable, so that when one finds a series like this one, it sets one up for the rest of the installments like a heroin junkie waiting for a fix.

Clearly I am in the minority with a two-star rating, but nevertheless it just isn't funny anymore. The two main reasons are, first: this is not a program for animal lovers. Of course I know that no animals were actually mistreated or injured, but I cannot find anything funny about kicking a dog, even if it is just going through the motions. Some of the other scenes with animals are also in poor taste and it is disappointing that the accidental destruction of two rare birds is offered as humor. Second, I cannot find entertainment in insulting patients, telling them to shut up, and again, disrespect being passed off as humor.  Maybe it's the election results, but I think I've had enough toxicity and vulgarity to last a while, although it looks like we're in for 4 years of it.

Episode 3 ""The Admirer"" had a piece of erotica that was so stunningly antithetical to the great balance of sensibility and wonderful humor that this work consistently achieves.  In fact I could hardly believe my eyes!  Let's face it, adult themes are a part of life and they have been so skillfully developed by the producers with such great humor and restraint in many of episodes we have watched.  But the utterly distasteful portrayal of the Doc's elderly aunt's sexual proclivities amounted to nothing but cheap imagery.  Very poor lack of judgement regardless of the artistic license imagined.  In the Doc's own words ""you [producers] were stupid"".",1461024000,2,878,4.898648648648648

I do enjoy that there are several story lines in each episode.  What I absolutely did not enjoy as I started over at the beginning over and over again is that I noticed that although the Doc is pompous and rude and is a social misfit, there is some humanity to his character.  The last few seasons have totally lost that bit of humanity and his character turns into a man who is just plain mean with very few moments of heartfelt moments.  He also has changed his voice into something ""old"" and constantly clearing his throat also like an old man.  I would love to see that crabby disinterested and rude doctor again who does have some humanity within him someplace and has not turned into a 90 year old man that absolutely never removes that suit jacket.  Early on although he preferred to always wear a suit, he did at times remove the outer jacket.  The kitchen apron over the suit jacket?  Too much....Get better Mister Clunes (Season 6)  and get that weight back on.  Your personality leaves you as a very handsome and desirable man indeed.

3203399,5,B000WGTD82,"With the advent of Series 3, ""Doc Martin"" continues to be both my husband and my favorite television series.  The only hard part of watching this program is that it is filmed every two years and waiting is not something that comes easy in an age of instant gratification.  On the other hand, when the wait is rewarded with something of the caliber of this show, I have learned to wait with good grace.

Martin Clunes is outstanding as the grumpy surgeon who is forced to work as a backwater doctor in this gorgeous sleepy town due to his own issues with the sight of blood (he vomits uncontrollably.)  He is now seeing a plus in living in the small town as his infatuation with Louisa (Caroline Catz) the school mistress grows by leaps and bounds.  The good doctor has next to zero social skills and has a tendency to say exactly what he is thinking regardless of the consequences or hurt that might be inflicted.  Actually, he doesn't seem to understand that his words have consequences - but that is all part of the fun.

The cast of this show is outstanding.  Each of the individuals has a quirky personality and can, on their own, command your attention by the sheer force of their excellent acting abilities.

I recommend the show to one and all - it is warm and funny and just simply good to watch.",1424736000,,1304,4.445378151260504

It doesn't matter what type of week that I have had, every stress and concern go by the wayside as we set up our little party with popcorn, cheese and crackers, and a glass or two of our favorite wine.  I hope all involved in this production realize that the mental and emotional state of those who watch this ongoing series is riding on their shoulders!  There are yet so many story lines that they could explore and go beyond series seven, of which will get me through the dreadful winter.  Perhaps the writers and producer will read this and hear my plea!  Please continue with this...as you have demonstrated time and time again, your authentic and creative flow.  Also note, it wouldn't hurt to let us peer in a little more to the attraction and utter adornment that both Martin and Louisa have for each other.

It is typical English humor at it's best mixing up a straight laced doctor who lived in this beautiful setting as a child but spent too much time in London becoming a top notch surgeon.  He goes back to a rural practice for vague reasons but resents it all the same.  It is a lot of fun for anyone over about 8.  His love interest (on again, off again) is a school teacher who just can't believe how stuffy the ""Doc"" can be socially and romantically.

 I started by watching the season 3 DVD and I won't be checking out any of the others.

The acting seemed contrived, the stories silly but not particularly funny and the main character Doc Martin, totally unlikable. Seemed like a robot to me, reading lines with no emotion.

The only thing this DVD might help with is insomnia. Boring!!!",1411689600,,446,4.5375

3203484,5,B000WGTD82,I enjoyed ALL of what I was able to see - then right in the middle of an episode it was gone! The least you could have done was give warning it was coming to a close! I don't think that was the correct way you chose to end it all ! Not good business practice as far as I am concerned ! I am sure I wasn't the ony one that it happened to!,1410393600,,337,3.506666666666667
3203485,5,B000WGTD82,"Season 3 Of ""Doc Martin"" is as bracingly funny as the previous seasons, with even stronger character development. Martin and Louisa continue to misunderstand and frustrate each other endearingly (the last episode of this season is simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking). Police Officer Penhale joins the cast and fits in seamlessly, and the relationship between Pauline and Al Large blooms. The acting is uniformly impeccable - these fine actors create fully realized characters.

BUT...an unwelcome surprise to anyone who, like me, was watching Seasons 1-5 for free as a Prime membership benefit. The first week of September 2014 those seasons went from free to pay overnight, with no warning. When I protested to Amazon, it refunded the charge for the first episode I watched after the change and explained that ""the video availability on our Prime catalog depend on our agreements with content owners. Due to these agreements few of the videos are not available for streaming on prime. The movies and TV shows that are currently available for our Prime Instant Video service may change from time to time depending on our agreements with content owners."" I understand that agreements change, but pulling the ""free"" plug with no prior notice was a low blow.",1410134400,,1263,5.1911764705882355

We found ourselves first accepting, then overlooking, and finally loving them, warts and all, for behavior we'd immediately dismiss people for in today's disposable, I-need-no-one-world. And perhaps that's the underlying theme of the show. Despite the Doc's behavior, he is devoted to Louisa and expertly cares for the villagers of Port Wen. We've come to cheer him on and wish him well. It's a sweet, gentle series, with just the right mix of humor, pathos, pratfalls and gore.",1408752000,,603,5.101010101010101

The entire cast is outstanding. Every character seems so real, you might well expect to meet them if you ever visited Portwenn/Port Isaac in Cornwall England. Filmed on location in Port Isaac, the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. I've enjoyed watching the show evolve over the years. It's been a hit since day 1. My only regret is that there are only roughly 12 episodes every year or so.

We have gotten to know the characters and the 'quirks' of Doc Martin and enjoyed the series a great deal.  Thus far the episodes have brought us many laughs and a few tears.

3203827,5,B000WGTD82,"So very funny.  Reminds me of the old TV series Northern Exposure, with all the unique and quirky personalities.",1405814400,,112,4.894736842105263
3203828,5,B000WGTD82,"The acting is so real, that after watching several seasons of this program I found myself talking to someone and actually having the same facial expressions as the character, Doc Martin!  I had not realized that I had been so immersed in this program.

The photography is beautiful and relaxing. The characters make you care about them. The situations while comical are also poignant and meaningful; and by following along with the story it is cathartic and helps you to release your own stresses.

I particularly like that even though there are continuing issues through the series, that each episode and each series moves forward towards positive improvements for it's characters...improovements that each of us could use in our own lives. And seeing someone do it on the screen in a small way, helps us have a little more courage to do it for ourselves.

Doc Martin, the main hero of the series, is a doctor with such poor social skills, and his own worst enemy in finding love...who  shows as the series progresses, that he had been mentally abused and abandoned by both of his self-centered, unloving parents...and it develops that this might have caused him to become closed, cold and self-centered. Then we see his yearning, his admiration of the beauty of the woman he has become to love, the pain caused by his ineptness (and it is wonderful to watch extremely good actors (Mr. Clunes is only one of many) show this without words...but just the look of their eyes in an almost immobile face, as IF we can read their minds) and his desire to release his heart and breathe deeply of the warmth of life...instead of just the coldness of facts.

Just everything is done right in this series.

Almost every home, or business is real looking. The dish detergent is out on the sink, the door has stains where the hands have touched too many times. The houses have old furniture and they don't look like they are out of magazines. (I hate it when series show everyone's house as if it has just been cleaned, or is strategically messy, and the furniture either looks like it was just bought, or brought from Salvation Army.)

The people wear their same clothes, as if each actor had their own closet of clothes that they use again and again.  (I hate it when I watch a series and I wonder how they have new clothes for each and every episode...and then try to convince me the episode is real to life.)

The medical knowledge is DEAD ON! Absolutely right. And there is enough of really neat medical info that most of the audience can use to help them in their own or their family's lives. (I hate watching shows where the medical info is just plain nonsense, poorly pronounced, and poorly preformed.)

It IS addicting. But luckily, only the most current series...which I think may be SIX, you have to buy. If you have a Prime membership the other seasons are free.  I have overindulged, and watched ALL the seasons...even when I had to pay. Now I am suffering withdrawal, and while I wish for the future seasons.

I am surprised to find that I enjoy watching the old seasons over and over again...and it is not just me but my spouse too, who feels this way.  I understand that is what is called, ""layering"".  Which means, so much, and so many details, and so many issues are layered on top of each other, that each time you watch; you see more, that you did not see last time.",1405814400,,3375,4.57379767827529

He says it like it is, no nonsense, truly not very likable, but he still wins you over.  I particularly liked the last episode of Season 3.  You probably don't need to watch them in a row, but it does help get to know the characters.  My only criticism is that sometimes characters suddenly are not on the show anymore and have been replaced, such as Doc Martin's office assistant or the town policeman.",1403395200,,523,4.350515463917525

3203955,5,B000WGTD82,"I caught a couple of episodes of season 6 recently on public television and was very intrigued by the characters and their situations. I got the first season to see what the heck was going on and who was whom and how they are related and I have been binge watching the early seasons whenever I get the chance. Even though there are numerous forehead thumping moments because of the bumbling and general ineptitude of the denizens of this small Cornish town, the characters and stories are endearing and I find myself pulling for them and looking forward to the next installment. Hence the train wreck analogy--sometimes I can barely stand to watch because I just know someone is going to do something silly and it will need to be fixed, and can't look away because it always (well mostly always) gets fixed and I look forward to the next bit of suspense that will accompany the next silliness.",1402876800,,893,4.622641509433962

Looks like the village chemist has a hidden husband but continues to be enamored with the doc....who is mostly oblivious to her interest.

I sure hope they are. I will certainly be the first to buy them. Thank you Martin Clunes for making this series. P.S. Lets not forget the dogs in the series. They are perfect.

Wonderful characters, funny British humor, and beautiful scenery.  We've seen Season 1 and 2 on television, and with my husband out of town, I decided to purchase the 3rd season so I could binge watch it on my Kindle.  And BTW, I LOVE watching movies on the Kindle.  The HD picture is wonderful and I don't even realize I'm watching on a small screen.  Anyhow, Season 3 is awesome.  I could watch Doc Martin and the fun characters who populate Portwenn forever.

Several of the characters are in every episode but each episode will have one or two people show up just for that episode.

Dr. Martin is a mess but a likeable one. Sometimes he is a little severe and needs to lighten up some. You just keep waiting for that to happen and then he lets you down. Hopefully someday he will soften up some. You know he cares because he saves peoples lives and gets angry when they don't take care of themselves but he is missing the soft side. I guess you would say we are just waiting! But, if it ever happens will it be the end? Hopefully not. We will go on to the next Season. All of the episodes are very entertaining.

He was a surgeon, but decided to become a general practionioner in a small fishing village after suddenly developing a phobia of blood thus setting him up for the jokes played on him by the locals when they learn of his fear! He is socially awkward and is in love with the local headmistress! Whenever an intimate moment arises, he ruins it by launching into a medical explanation ( I.e. When they kiss for the first time after spending the entire night in the hospital with a sick patient, he tells her she has bad breath and begins to expound on the importance of personal hygiene!) despite his awkwardness and his propensity for saying the wrong thing, he does care about his patients and  will follow up if he thinks something is amiss!

The doc is a harmless oddball who really tries to do his best, but refuses to be like everyone else.  The rest of the village just has a time getting used to him and accepting that he has the most unusual manner.  Lots of exaggerated human nature on display in these stories and the scenery is really amazingly beautiful.",1383696000,,488,4.5
3205065,5,B000WGTD82,I love the actors in the series and the humor is always entertaining. I would love to go visit the village where the series is filmed but since that is probably out of the question I enjoy seeing the countryside.,1383523200,,212,4.325
3205066,5,B000WGTD82,Both funny and poignant with excellent acting.  Characters are unique but believable.  Sexual tension between Martin and Louisa is British acting at its best.,1383436800,,158,5.541666666666667

3205069,5,B000WGTD82,"Doc Martin is real, funny and a welcome addition to BBC offerings.  I like to stream it everyday.  It's so sensitive & caring --  just what we are missing from the sensational harshness of today's TV",1383091200,,199,4.472222222222222

3205095,5,B000WGTD82,I became obsessed with the Doc Martin series through my local PBS station and have been hooked ever since.  As an Amazon Prime member I was able to have a Doc Martin marathon on all 5 seasons and i feel complete.,1382745600,,212,4.170731707317073

3205097,5,B000WGTD82,"I love watching all of the Doc Martin series. The setting of the series is in a beautiful little village in Cornwall and the filming captures it's beauty. The show is full of great characters, but Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz are outstanding in their rolls. The roll Martin
Clunes plays is so opposite of his true personality that it must be physically tiring to play the role of such a serious and grumpy person.
My only complaint is that we have to wait too long between series. I can't wait until we can see Series 6 here in the states. I hope there will be a Series 7!",1382486400,,575,4.284403669724771

3205115,5,B000WGTD82,I love good British television.  And the scenery in this series is phenomenal.  I'd almost move to Cornwall to live in a sweet little village like this.,1381708800,,152,4.592592592592593

3205119,5,B000WGTD82,"Doc Martin brilliant English comedy. Sense of dry humor is evident or well prescribe by the ""Doc"". All you do is fall in love with him and the cast of characters. Brilliant comedy - cheers",1380844800,,188,4.4
3205120,5,B000WGTD82,"I find the Martin character oddly compelling.  Although it would seem there is nothing on the surface to make him likeable, I kept
tuning in to see just a glimpse of the good guy beneath.  Those glimpses of his brilliance as a doctor along with his struggle to
be anything more than just a shadow of what all the other towns people would choose, keeps me interested and not at all bored.
Clunes would appear to be masterfully playing a rather two dimensional character that makes us want to see those rare moments
where what we hope for shines through.",1380844800,,552,4.51

3205143,5,B000WGTD82,Great program as was season 1 and 2!  Very well done - acting is excellent and I particularly enjoy the scenic English countryside as well as the visits into the homes and businesses of the characters on the show.  I watch the show on my Kindle and use earphones.  And that is far better than on a larger screen as it is a far more intimate experience.,1380412800,,352,4.223880597014926
3205144,5,B000WGTD82,"I had never heard of this series before I found it on my kindle.  I have amazon prime, so it was a free stream.  I began watching it at season 2 because for some reason I couldn't locate season one.  I was hooked from the first few minutes and have watched all the episodes through season 5.  Since then I've found the first season and will watch it soon.

This series is so good--quirky, funny, winsome, endearing, blunt & surprising.  I would recommend this for anyone looking to escape from the nastiness and unpleasantness of  what's going on in the world today.  It will transport you to a village in England where time seems to have stopped, although everyone has cell phones and computers--but the pace of life is slower, everyone knows everyone else and watches out for them, the scenery is breathtaking, and you'll come away feeling like you're part of the community.",1380240000,,876,4.642857142857143
3205145,4,B000WGTD82,We have really enjoyed the program.  It is fun to see how doc deals with various situations and his own brusque personality.  The commedy is clean and void of foul language that other programs feel they must provide.  The plot is intriguing and invites one to see the next episode.,1380153600,,281,4.58

3205147,5,B000WGTD82,"I'm an american that has fallen in love with Doc Martin.  Martin Clunes and cast makes the show believable - almost like they are your next door neighbors.  This IS a much different role for Martin Clunes to the other Doc Martin movies, as he was kinder and gentler in those but the Series puts Doc Martin in a new light.  Clunes does a wonderful job with his grumpy doctoring manners and his almost boyish love for Louisa.

Each series gets better and better.  Something you'll watch over and over and over.",1379808000,,508,4.478260869565218

3205150,2,B000WGTD82,"Too much over the top in several episodes, (for example: the episode where the young man is ""going at it"" on the kitchen table with Doc Martin's aunt - an elderly woman).

Very disrespectful not only to the viewer, but also to women in general and elderly women in particular.  If I wanted to watch that kind of ""crap,"" I'd tune in to the vast wasteland of American television.",1379376000,3,377,4.449275362318841
3205151,5,B000WGTD82,"I had no idea that I would enjoy this series. I would make fun of the show not expecting to become captured but all the characters of Port Wenn.

3205174,5,B000WGTD82,"I previously rated Seasons 1 & 2 of this show as among the best entertainment being broadcast.  In all honesty, I thought that there was a slight drop off in the story lines for Season 3, so I would probably have rated it with 4.5 stars were that possible.  However, since half-stars are not an option, I chose to give it 5, rather than 4, stars.  Why?  Because despite my feeling that Season 3 wasn't quite as good as its predecessors in terms of story lines, the acting and overall production in this series is still superb, and my wife and I really can't wait to start viewing Season 4.  Kudos to Amazon for offering Doc Martin for ""free"" as a benefit of being an Amazon Prime member.",1378771200,,687,4.3359375

3205243,4,B000WGTD82,Doc Martin shows his personal relationship skills. He really does miss the mark. The rudeness is actually the lack of thoughtful consideration for others. This we find out is his personality created during his youth. All in all the TV show tastefully creates Doc Martin. This is a very funny show.

3205277,4,B000WGTD82,"I enjoy the humor and scenery.  I do like it when we see Doc Martin's character soften in certain situations he gets faced with.  Of course, he is terribly rude, guess because of the conditions he has which affects his relationship with people.  I hated the episode where his aunt and the younger man got together.  It was repulsive.  I will keep watching if those types of situations do not reoccur.  People need humor and less reality.

The sole physician in town has absolutely no bed-side manner, but the way he deals with his patients (very abrupt and rude) takes you by surprise and you can't help but laugh out loud.  Every now and then you get a glimpse of him that shows he really does care about the people around him, in-spite of the outward appearances.  Not a good choice for children under 13 or anyone who can't stand the sight of blood (by the way, he can't either!)",1375056000,,571,4.317757009345795

The people that populate the village to which Doc Martin has moved are a wonderful group to play off of his odd personality.  It is great fun to see how all of their relationships develop.

It's easy to go from episode to episode with my Amazon Prime instant streaming, which I think is just great.

Unfortunately, he developed an aversion to blood which forced him to relocate as a GP to a small fishing village in Cornwall.  The episodes revolve around the down to earth (more often quirky) residents of the village and their relationship to Doc Martin and each other.  There's Martin's organic farmer aunt Joan; the village plumber turned restaurateur and his handsome son; Martin's pretty, smart sometimes less than efficient receptionist; the married village pharmacist & her husband who works on an oil rig; the narcoleptic, agoraphobic village policeman; and the head teacher at the village school (Martin's off again-on again love interest).  The story lines are very well written and usually bring in new characters from outside the village for variety.

The humor is dry but so entertaining. Each episode has some serious moments as well.  It is hard to believe that a person who is dedicated to caring for others can be so rude while doing so. Doc Martin is such a person. Everyone in this village has issues. I absolutely love this program. I am ecstatic that this program and many others are free to Amazon Prime members. This is not a paid for review. I have saved so much being a Prime member. Now I get to watch good programs as well on my laptop or on my Kindle HD.,1373068800,,690,4.2272727272727275

How could any physician have so little ""bedside manner""?  Also this is advertised as a comedy and even though there are comedic moments, it is primarily a drama and a frustrated romance show.

 The scenery and the supporting cast are quaint and attractive to me to the extent that my next visit to the British Isles will include Cornwall.  It is interesting to watch Doc Martin's personality soften a bit as the episodes move on and I am anxious to watch his bumbling romance move on.  As I said I am intrigued and therefore continue to watch.  The characters Pauline and Aunt Joan are particularly fun to watch.

At the same time, his relationship with his Aunt becomes even more intriguing as he walks in on her ""In flagrante delicto"" having sex on a table with an artist 20 years her junior. As they work through the issue and as he deals with multiple issues of ethics and privacy, you see him in a different light.

Al Large returns in this season - with his own secrets and problems.

A mixed bag - some good, some bad, but all Doc Martin.",1366070400,,612,4.545454545454546

3205651,5,B000WGTD82,If you haven't watched the Doc Martin series you have missed a great deal of fun.  After the very first episode I just could not wait for PBS to slowly unveil the rest of the series.  I ordered every series and have watched them all a few times over with the same amount of enjoyment as the first one.  Now I wait for Series  6 whch is promised in the fall of 2013.  If you watched All Creatures Great and Small you will love this updated version of quirky characters in a small coastal town and the doctor who takes care of them all. This all takes place in 2003 and after so it is much more up to date than All Creatures which showed life before WW11 in a small town.  Those who wonder how the National Health Service works in England would do well to take notice but naturally our particular hero goes above and beyond.  Never-the-less the basic care is there since the doctor gets paid by the number of patients on his register rather than how many times he see each patient.,1364428800,,979,4.231182795698925

3205659,5,B000WGTD82,"Doc Martin is a bit like the TV series House, but Doc Martin can elicit empathy for his shortcommings. You want him  to succeed in his relationships. He has a bad bedside manner and is rude but he really  cares for his patients. He is an amazing Doctor with many problems. The show is set in  a small fishing village and the scenery is very pleasing to look at and the cast very talented. When you care for the characters in a show you know it is well written and played. Great Show... Love every minute of it!",1363737600,,510,4.183673469387755

3205684,5,B000WGTD82,"My wife told me about the Doc Martin series after seeing some episodes on TV.  I found the series on my Kindle Fire and am now hooked on them.  The British seem to know how to create high quality TV series with interesting, quirky characters who find themselves in interesting, amusing and thought-provoking situations.  Being a physician, I can identify with some of Martin's Asperger symptoms.  Even though many of the characters' quirks are off-the-wall, I think that viewers can see some of those traits in themselves.  It's something like looking at yourself in a mirror.  Now my wife is watching all of the series on the Kindle Fire, and I must fight her for it.",1363737600,,668,4.7155172413793105

3205689,5,B000WGTD82,"I started watching this series by accident.  It was just on when nothing else was on tv.
I enjoyed it so much that I bought the first season, then watched the second season on PBS.  The third season is even better than expected.
Doc Martin starts out as a hemophobic surgeon moving to a country practice in the Village of Port Wen.  He tries to survive as a family practitioner with no people skills.  With his abrasive personality he manages to insult everyone he comes in contact with.  The results are hilarious, and after a couple of episodes you really care about the characters.
Well done, It's a great place to escape.",1363219200,,625,4.544642857142857

With life the way it is, all the stress and worry over things we have little or no power to change life gets ""heavy"".  An episode of Martin is what my husband and I end our day with.  Better than any drug, hot milk, or knock on the head. Try it, I PROMISE you won't regret it!!!",1362787200,,413,4.285714285714286
3205727,5,B000WGTD82,"Otherwise, you will be really annoyed with yourself for spending time watching this grumpy guy--the brilliant surgeon who, alas, is almost completely lacking in interpersonal skills.  Like House on this side of the Atlantic, Doc Martin is rather, well, flawed as a human being, despite being extraordinarily competent as a physician.  Along with his brusque demeanor, he is also hemophobic--yep, a doctor who cannot be in the presence of blood without throwing up.  What makes this series delightful is not so much the rude doctor, but the populace of the village in which he is the authorized physician.  A flock of those quite talented actors so common to the British make the doc's life more complicated--and the audience's experience more entertaining.  As I've commented in other reviews of this series, I suspect viewers either love this guy or cannot stand him.  The number of stars I have given my rating tells you where I fall.",1362614400,,936,5.006451612903226

Things go wrong in the most amazing ways, and yet there is a resilience to the characters and the insight that, in the end, they all rely on each other.  Season 3 shows the developing relationship between Doc Martin and Louisa Glasson amid the backdrop of all of the crazy goings-on of the Port Wenn crew.

Best to watch it from the beginning.it's about an English surgeon who has to give up operating ( I won't spoil the reason why), and takes a job as a general practitioner in a small village.  The doctor has poor social skills and the series is about Doc Martin slowly fitting in (or not) with the village. The other characters are great. Love the pharmacist and the police officers. Of course there is a love interest with many twists and turns. A few of the doctors relatives appear throughout the series-they are interesting characters.  And good news! I read recently that there will be a season 6! Thoroughly enjoyed this series. It was free with amazon instant video, so if you have that, give this series a try.",1361836800,,862,4.484076433121019

3205837,5,B000WGTD82,"Barely two months after I first viewed the first episode, ""Doc Martin"" has now become one of my favorite productions ever, movie or television.  In fact, it's hard to think of a better production that I've seen in decades of television and movie viewing -- the outstanding comedy and drama of ""Doc Martin"" are that good.  Five stars are hardly enough for a program that produces this kind of enjoyment.

I've now watched all of the currently existing episodes through Series 5, and in my opinion, ""Doc Martin"" sustains its very high level of quality throughout, so I'd recommend the DVDs of all of the seasons.  I can hardly wait for Series 6, which star Martin Clunes has confirmed will be filmed in 2013 and will likely be the last series for the program.

For the uninitiated, the premise of the show is that the rather grouchy, socially inept but brilliant Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes) is taking over as a general practitioner in the picturesque seaside village of Portwenn in southwestern England, after leaving his London surgical practice when he develops a blood phobia.  Schoolteacher Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz) is one of the few villagers who appreciates Martin's good qualities -- she understands that his social rudeness disguises a man who actually cares for other people in a very literal way.  A romance results, creating a running thread through all of the seasons, although there are significant setbacks along the way.

Martin and Louisa are joined by plumber/restauranteur Bert Large (Ian McNeice) and his son/business partner Al (Joe Absolom); Martin's Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole), who runs a small, struggling family farm by herself; later on, Martin's Aunt Ruth (Dame Eileen Atkins), a psychiatrist; a series of quirky receptionists in the doctor's office, with Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) as the longest-serving and most memorable; the village pharmacist, Mrs. Tishell (Selina Cadell), who has a lasting crush on Martin; and two successive village police officers, Mark Mylow (Stewart Wright) and Joe Penhale (John Marquez), who share some well-meaning comic ineptitude with Mayberry's Barney Fife.

Both the acting and the writing on ""Doc Martin"" contain considerable depth.  My wife and I knew we were seeing something unusually good when, after each episode, we began discussing the characters' motivations, how their family backgrounds affected their personalities, and what those characters might have been doing while they were off-stage as a logical prelude to their on-stage actions.  Now, obviously, we know that these are fictional characters who don't really have family backgrounds and aren't really doing anything when they're not in a scene.  But the actors and the writers have created characters with so many dimensions that there is something very real about them -- it makes the viewer care about what they're going through now and wonder what's going to happen to them next.  To me, this is the ultimate success for a dramatic production: to create its own reality, one that the audience cares about.  All of the actors noted above and, of course, the writers have a great deal to be proud of here.

As you might guess, almost every program contains medical problems for Martin to deal with, ranging from routine but sometimes funny ailments to life-threatening emergencies -- that's the life of the only doctor in a small village.  But this isn't really a show about medicine, even though the main character is a medical doctor, it's a comedy/drama about a wide variety of people with a wide variety of things going on in their lives -- from Aunt Joan's financial problems on the farm to the Larges' business setbacks to the romantic yearnings of PC Mark Mylow.  But although the group of characters (and actors) here is outstanding, I wouldn't call this a true ensemble drama, because the series focuses on Martin, who is undoubtedly the main character -- this is his story, even though the other characters' stories are told as well.  As the show progresses, Louisa comes to share that focus because her relationship with Martin becomes so important to the show.  In this aspect, there's a certain similarity to ""Pride and Prejudice,"" I think, because both stories involve a romance, long in developing, between a very good-natured, sensible, and highly competent woman and a rather rude, haughty, but worthwhile man who needs someone to humanize him.  Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz constantly impress with the meaning they bring to these roles with their brilliantly subtle characterizations.  Small, almost unnoticed expressions often convey worlds of feeling.

(The Martin-Louisa romance has really caught the public imagination, apparently.  In an LA Times interview, Martin Clunes says that ""[a] boy came up and asked me for my autograph, followed by an old man who said, 'I don't want your autograph but just marry that girl before I die, willya?' That seems to sum up the level at which it hits people."")

But I'm not trying to downplay the other characters, and the excellent actors who portray them.  They're all a very important part of this show's considerable charm, and they all have their turns (sometimes numerous turns) as the center of different subplots in particular episodes.  These subplots can be either comic or dramatic for particular characters, rather than being only one or the other, again showing the depth of the writing and acting.  For example, Bert and Al Large, who are usually involved in rather funny situations, also deal with more serious family issues and business problems. PC Joe Penhale, a classic well-meaning bumbler, also has a sad encounter with his ex-wife.  And even when a character doesn't have his/her own plotline, that person very ably supports the characters who do.

While there's certainly a good deal of drama in these programs, the laughs shouldn't be overlooked.  The Larges, the police officers, the receptionists, and Mrs. Tishell all provide much humor -- as does Martin himself, whose disdainful reactions to the villagers are often very funny.

This story of an emotionally stunted man has the potential to create an abundance of emotion in its audience, because most viewers, I think, will care about these characters, laughing at their foibles and commiserating with their sorrows.  I give it my highest recommendation.  I would guess that most people who see just a few of the early episodes will, like me, want to see all of them, perhaps multiple times.",1346889600,,6482,5.09640831758034
3205838,5,B000WGTD82,This was a very good series. I wish it was longer or had a part two or something. Surely there is more to add to the story? What becomes of Al for instance?,1341360000,,156,3.757575757575758
3205839,3,B000WGTD82,"Even though the writing for this series seems a bit obvious and the character somewhat one dimensional, the townspeople and the doctor himself begin to grow on you and you'll laugh at their predicaments and care what happens to them.

One thing I would have appreciated would have been more continuity.  It seems as if, in many cases, actors have been contracted to work for only one episode or one particular season.  Many patients have conditions which are diagnosed, but we never really know what becomes of them.  This is unsatisfying and curious, as they are mostly permanent residents of this small village.

Also some main character's will be missing abruptly in follow up seasons as if their contract negotiations failed or something.  I didn't particulary care for the 1st season's receptionist, but I really liked the town constable from seasons 1 and 2, but perhaps the new cop from season 3 will be fleshed out more and become more interesting to the viewers.

I thought toward the end of this 3rd season that Martin would take a great step forward while still being his flawed self - we've seen he really cares about his aunt and Luisa- but we'll wait to see if his character grows and develops in a deeper way.  I hope Luisa won't be MIA for the remaining seasons.",1335484800,3,1278,4.699551569506727

3205857,3,B000WGTD82,"Season 3 of Doc Martin still delivers a comedy punch, wrapped in delightful scenery and scenarios. However, unlike Season 2 (the best, IMHO) this season suffers from far-fetched plots. Worse, some of the characters we've come to know & love lose their sparkle and depth. Season 3 will please die-hard Doc Martin fans, but those who appreciate subtle plot and character development will be disappointed.

First (not a spoiler, since it's revealed in episode 1), the greatest loss is that of PC Mark Mylow, played by the wonderful and bewitching Stewart Wright. Unlike Season 2's swapping in of Pauline for Elaine as Doc's receptionist (THANK YOU, writers! Who else couldn't stand Elaine?), PC Penhale is a ho-hum replacement. His character twists through a few plot turns that I found lame. With each episode, I just wanted Mark back. Thank goodness we viewers still get to visit Portwenn's other colorful characters, including Mrs. Tishell (played by Selina Cadell).

A few of the other ""flattened"" characters in this season are Pauline and Auntie Joan. Episode 4 focuses on, ahem, a highly improbable and slightly off-putting aspect of Joan's life (so out of character I wondered if I was hallucinating). In episode 5, Pauline's behavior takes a bizarre turn -- one that's summarily ignored in the rest of the series. It's just... odd, as though the writers don't understand how to make these characters three-dimensional.

Another bittersweet character note: the Large men (Bert and Al) are back -- although Bert's not quite so large anymore! (The DVD's trivia feature reveals that Ian McNeice lost 70 pounds before Season 3 was filmed. It shows.) Their interplay is lovely, and yet I can almost hear the show's creators/writers struggling to provide them with a new set of challenges. By the season's end, they've nearly become caricatures of themselves.

The silver lining, I suppose, is the growing chemistry and interaction between Louisa and Martin. Their relationship gets more traction in this season. Many of the reviews here on Amazon have ruined the ending of the season with their spoilers, which I won't do. However, I'll add that I found the final episode to end in a fitting manner -- it just made sense to me.

In a not incidental note of thanks, Acorn Media can be applauded for continuing to include subtitles for this season (I've had to give up watching British shows because of a lack of subtitles. Sad but true.)

If you're already in love with Doc Martin and the village of Portwenn, nothing I say will stop you from buying Season 3. But consider yourself forewarned: lower your expectations a bit lest you find yourself watching these episodes with a big imaginary ""HUH?"" floating over your head.",1299715200,14,2721,4.9823788546255505

Doc Martin, played by Martin Ellingham, is a most unlikely hero; at first viewing one may wonder why this man was selected to play the part. After just a few minutes he becomes Doc Martin and it's hard to imagine anyone else as the Doc.

Series 3 continues where Series 2 left off with a few minor changes; we have a new PC played by John Marquez. PC Penhale arrives with his own set of dreams and problems with which Doc must deal. Doc's on and off interest in Louisa, played by Caroline Catz, begins to be on more than off.

The beautiful scenery of Port Wenn, played by the Village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, is always a delight; the charm of the village, the narrow streets, and the beauty of the surrounding countryside is very pleasant to the eyes. I have to admit that the narrow streets and roads are interesting to see, but I wouldn't want to drive on them!

3205887,5,B000WGTD82,"(After seeing the first series:)

This is most like Clatterford in some ways, mainly the townspeople acting like one organism. . Though Clatterford has its own special irony and interwoven commentary on personalities: 1l upper-class unconscious twitness, 2) extreme well duh, super-pop unconscious extra-environmental-or-whatever-you've-got-going-vegetarian-etc.-ness, 3) multiple personality disorder managed by the townspeople.
Clatterford has a certain sophisticated wit and humour.

Whereas Doc Martin is not 'zany' or 'a comedy'. (Unless you're given to ridiculing people.)I'd call it 'light drama'.

Martin is insensitive, inappropriate and brilliant at his work, angry, arrogant, loveable.. He is like some Asperger's types I have known. You can love them, perhaps, but often get hurt feelinngs because they don't know how to treat people.

This is an intelligent series made with no seams. I hurried and ordered the next one as I was getting toward the end of the first.

Review of Series 3
Excellent, mostly. BUT, under no circumstances watch episode 4. Especially, no children under 18 should watch episode 4. It is a downer, regular characters suddenly mis-drawn, and a highly irregular, even traumatizing (to children) subplot. For adults it just leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
There is nothing uplifting or enjoyable about Episode 4, Series 3, nor is there any part of the plot that is advanced by it. It is just wrong conception and annoyingly bad writing.

I'm not sure whether the title character represents the best of Britain's socialized medicine system  (he's very competent) or the worst (he has the bedside manner of a prison guard), but Martin Clunes brings a great sense of reality to his portrayal of a one-time London surgeon who develops a fear of blood and relocates to Cornwall to serve as the family doctor for a small coastal town. The views of Cornwall alone would make buying the series worthwhile, but the actors and actresses who comprise the cast are generally superb.
The DVD cover quotes a reviewer as saying it's ""absolutely bloody hilarious"". It's not. It's more the genre we call ""dramedy"" than straight comedy and, while there certainly is funny stuff, it's not ""Fawlty Towers"". Having bought and watched the first three series of Doc Martin and thoroughly enjoyed all three, I've ordered Series Four and am looking forward to it.",1284681600,,1038,4.8977272727272725

3205904,5,B000WGTD82,"After seeing one episode, I had to go and purchase the entire series.  It has the typical British dry sense of humor, very unique and fresh characters, and it is totally politically incorrect.  I shared the DVDs with my adult kids, and they both loved the show.  Even watching it the second time, you pick up a lot of subtleties that you miss during the first viewing.  It is refreshing, very well done, and fast-paced.  It is one of the best TV shows I've seen in a long time.  You don't have the stupid laugh tracks, typical with US shows.  It is clean irreverent humor with sparkling personalities.  Good Stuff.",1279843200,2,614,4.5181818181818185
3205905,5,B000WGTD82,"Season three (3) of the series Doc Martin continues its high standard of a very entertaining program.  In season three we get seven (7) episodes on two (2) discs running about 323 minutes.

Doc Martin the only Doctor in the beautiful seaside village of Portwenn is played wonderfully by Martin Clumes.  Doc Martin is still very brilliant solving medical problems that plague the little village and its very eccentric (strange) inhabitants.  NO Doc Martin's manner has not gotten any better--if anything he is a little more abrasive and rude with no patience for most of his patients neither with friendly cuddly dogs nor with annoying liitle children.  The only persons that he seems to tolerate somewhat are his aunt Joan and his love interest Louisa.  They don't always escape his insults and barbs; however, they see that very deep inside he is a ""good person"" but you do have to get beyond his gruff exterior which at times is very hard to do.  In spite of a repulsion at the sight of blood (the reason he's no longer a surgeon in London and the reason he's a GP in Portwenn), he's really very medically brilliant and very dedicated--just no bedside manner.

Yes. I continue to enjoy this series.  It combines a lot of humor with a lot of medical sleuthing.  I look forward to more seasons and certainly intend to purchase them.  I am just very glad that I got into this series because it has been simply delightful.",1279843200,3,1420,4.662650602409639
3205906,5,B000WGTD82,"This show is clever and endearing. Doc Martin's obnoxious personality aside, the thing that makes you want to root for him is his humanity and sheer vulnerability. One minute you want to slap him and the next minute you're proud to know him. The villagers are delightful, nosey, and everything one would expect from a small fishing town in the UK. If you like British television I can't see how you wouldn't thoroughly enjoy this series.",1275782400,3,437,4.7631578947368425

I had never heard of the series until I was in Cornwall and my friends pointed out the house used as his office.  Then I began to notice other places in the village as I watched the show which made it even more fun.  The cast is perfect and Martin Clunes is the perfect Martin.

3205930,5,B000WGTD82,"For a long time, I read the synopses of the DOC MARTIN series, but I did not think I would enjoy them.  Then I purchased the first series, and within the first episode I was involved with the doctor's life, personality, and nature.  I also became very involved with the villagers, people who disliked him, but respected his professional skills.  I then viewed volumes 2 and 3.  I still have not been able to view the last episode of volume 3 because it's an unhappy ending, but I am hoping that volume 4 will rescue the love interest of the doctor and the enchanting schoolmarm.

I recommend these volumes to all who enjoy comedy at its British best.",1270684800,2,650,4.47457627118644
3205931,1,B000WGTD82,"The ONE Star has nothing to do with the quality of the programs.  I am absolutely a HUGE Doc Martin fan and cannot get enough of the show, which is why I eagerly ordered Series 3.  I hunkered down for a jolly old Doc Martin marathon, thorougly relishing the first two episodes, then was dismayed and stunned to discover the third episode of Series 3 was a repeat from my Doc Martin Series 1 or 2 DVDs!  Then again it happened on the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh episodes!  If you already own the Series 1 & 2 DVDs and don't mind spending $30 for only TWO episodes you've not seen, then by all means go for it; the two new episodes, like all the others, are a delight.  It is of note that one of the two ""new"" episodes ought to have been shown much earlier as it introduces, obviously for the first time, the officious narcoleptic/agoraphobic village policeman we met early on (probably in Series 1) who was later replaced by gentler ""Mark"".",1269302400,13,944,4.371428571428571

3205933,1,B000WGTD82,"Gratuitous violence toward animals.
Warnng: ""The GP always rings twice"" contains a scene of outlandish disregard for animal life.  The bumbling Doc Martin drives his car over a helpless Yorkie and crushes the small animal to death beneath his 4,000-pound luxury car.  One of the unwritten rules of drama is that you don't kill dumb animals to progress your simplistic and indifferent plot.  Sadists among us already prey upon helpless domesticated animals without the cheer leading and encouragement of TV shows like this.  If the producers have no better sense of proportion and sensitivity,they should be blackballed from ever producing their violent-endorsing drivel on the unsuspecting public again.  Cancel this monstrosity of so-called entertainment before it offends us again.",1268784000,6,783,5.546218487394958
3205934,5,B000WGTD82,"Doc Martin is a cleverly written show that fits the prescription for funny as well as a storyline that will capture your attention.  The writing is far above average, but the characters are brought to us by excellent actors who have developed them into people that you care about and are interested in.  It NEVER fails to delight, please, and touch you in many ways.  Martin Clunes is outstanding as the Doc and is never one dimensional and always on target.  It is a show I never tire of and always look forward to viewing.  Filmed in beautiful Port Issac it is a visually pleasing show.

3205936,5,B000WGTD82,"If you liked Doc Martin seasons 1 and 2, you will LOVE season 3.  The side stories are funnier than previous seasons, and the relationship between the two leads finally moves on a bit.  Martin Clunes once again fills the screen with his subtle, hilarious facial expressions.  And more so than in previous seasons, Caroline Catz gets the chance to display her own perfect comedic timing, and gives Clunes some serious competition in the ""rubber-faced"" department!  The ending isn't what one would hope for, but not to worry...there are eight more episodes to follow in season 4.  Only complaint:  Why did Acorn Media change the episode titles for North America???  Doc Martin has already aired in Canada with the originals.  I found episode five's change from ""The Holly Bears a Prickle"" to ""Breaking Up Is Hard To Do"" especially cheesy. Sorry, but the originals were far more clever and quirky...a much better fit, as Doc Martin itself is best described as the definitive clever and quirky television drama.",1265068800,14,1007,4.9523809523809526
3205937,5,B000WGTD82,"Doc Martin Series 3 is lacking only in quantity of episodes. This is too fun a series to settle for so few. Of course Series 1 & 2 helps. Rude, grumpy Doc (Martin Clunes) vomits at the sight of blood. You'll laugh at the sight of other townsfolk in this serene, beautiful, fictional Portwenn (filmed in Port Isaac, Cornwall). Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole) is sane, almost, as is teacher Louisa (Caroline Cutz). Receptionist and phlebotomist Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) is outrageously funny along with Bert Large (Ian McNeice) and...well the list goes on with the regular cast.

If you love English seaside village views and homespun humor, this is a series that will tickle your fancy, every episode, and make you beg for more. Episodes tend to carry over to the next and all have SUBTITLES. This is some of the best British Doctor's Life Comedy/drama ever produced. The ""Doc Martin Series"" is to Medical Comedy what ""Pie In The Sky"" is to Police Comedy. (See my reviews on both.)

Bonus stuff includes cast filmographies and fun trivia along with subtitles.

For the detail minded:
..1 Tick Tock--Includes Pauline and Louisa seems to be trying to help doctor locals including a girl who jumps on car tops, her overweight mom, the fainting teacher Louisa, overlysleepy new cop, and a blind man with an untrained dog.
..2 The Morning After--Bert large changes from plumber to chef. Scenic Portwenn is hit with widespread food poinsoning, including Louisa, unrequited love to the stiff naive Doc.  A general misdiagnosis also proves to be a huge error in source.
..3 Love Thy neighbor--Louisa's new neighbors, a psychologist, has strange parental practices for their brat son. Conditions run rampant with the cop being agoraphobic (going out fear) & narcoleptic (sleep disorder), and others with rashes, and then there was Doc's blood phobia, & inability to tenderize a relationship with Louisa.
...4 The GP Always Rings Twice--Admirers aplenty in Portwenn. A divorcee pursues Doc. Auntie Joan has 'relations' with a painter. The plumber/chef's son, Al, Pauline's old flame, returns. Then there's Princess Tinkle, she dog.
...5 Breaking Up Is Hard to Do--Pauline's gambling on the internet at the surgery. Doc & Louisa gamble on a real date. And kiss. Nothing's going very well leading up to an unrelated beach accident and a surprise outcome.
...6 The Two of Us--Portwenn engagement news is rampant. Aunt Joan hears by rumor--oops! Large Restaurant struggles as does many with fungus illness.
...7 In Sickness and in Health--A very pregnant bridesmaid shoots her eye with a party popper. The vicar's drinking. The reception patio is flooded. Wedding florist is arrested. The bad news continues on this the wedding day.

Delightful, warm, hilarious, witty, and quick dialogue moves this beautifully filmed series along so fast you'll be disappointed when the complete list of episodes are done. Then, like me, you have to click for a notification of Doc Martin, Series 4.  I think I should go back and repeat Series 1-2-3 in the meantime.",1261526400,60,3036,5.062

She is arrogant and cruel and stupid. This series has its funny moments, but it's also frustrating and annoying.
