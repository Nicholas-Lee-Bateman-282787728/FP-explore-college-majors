It was made during a time  when kids actually aspired to make a decent home-grown horror film, and while the film is a mess at times, the sheer will of the crew to make a decent film, easily overcomes the faults. Some scenes just abruptly STOP, others make zero sense....yet, its a FUN movie to kick back and enjoy! Buy it fast, as its limited to only 200 copies...",1528243200,,442,4.390243902439025
8650762,5,B00JH166TC,"Whooa this little gem was hard to come by. This is a good example of a great low b-rated film. This is the original Day of the Reaper, the picture aint the best actually its really bad that its good to watch these types of movies with lines that run down the tv screen. some of the wording is amazing! plus the age this movie was shot shows us you don't need a lot to make a crappy film, this is what i always thought pictures in movies looked like back then. The girls were all hott and have that 80's look like in friday the 13th but better in my opion. The story might not make a lot of sense and certain scenes will just cut out but the acting is absurd and you gotta love it....it's a lot of fun to put on and watch with friends. Theres a scene in the movie i practically like that you normally wouldnt see on screen this girl is walking through a cemetery with a 15yr old kid who is supposed to be acting like a detective who's trying to solve these murders and find this killer known as the Reaper....the whole ground is wet, mudd everywhere and nasty wile they're walking thru it and talking she is wearing heels and accidentally steps in a puddle of water then looks down in embarrassment, i thought it was hilarious!! Well you get the picture the whole movie is basically really cheesie and hardcore fake-lookin gore effects. YOu won't want to miss out if you're a fan of these kinds of movies and be warned they're limited and extremely Rare. Im not sure how many of copies are left out there but its difficult to find them and yes they are all numbered every copy. Also there is some of the most strangest noises and creepiest sound effects ive ever heard witch is really good that i enjoyed this better. Running Time for this movie is 1hr. 11min. It is the original unrated movie so you cant get any better then this right here.  A+  Shocking.",1495324800,,1856,4.254957507082153
