1296978,3,B00003CY5S,"Acceptably entertaining period drama taken straight out of real life.  A few too many flashbacks as the director sold us on how pure-at-heart the countess was.  Personally, I wouldn't care how pure or unpure she was, because the whole royal court is portrayed here as a veritable saturnalia complete with debauched cardinals and studly men who [hire] themselves out to old ladies.

If they had made this more of a black comedy I think it would have been a bit better of a plot.  Besides that, the settings, costume, and music make this movie.  Hillary Swank is good, but her character was supposed to be this great woman fighting for her family name when really she was more ambitious and jealous than anything else.  Christopher Walken is outstanding as the cardinal's prophet, though.

I wish I could actually give this 3.5 stars.  Definitely worth watching in the theater, or renting on DVD.

1296979,2,B00003CY5S,"What a wretched piece of cinema.  I mean, truly wretched.  And the fault lies almost totally with Hillary Swank.  She plays Jeanne de la Motte with such-over-the top mellodrama.  She never seems to totally connect with the character, giving us this wide-eyed, fast-talking character that is neither compelling nor sympathetic.
What an utter shame.  For she was surrounded by some true talent.  The actor who plays Cardinal de Rohan is fantastic.  In fact, all of the secondary actors and actresses do a decent job.
There's also the matter of the wildly inaccurate retelling of history.  Clearly the writers and director wanted viewers to feel terribly sorry for poor little Jeanne.  They perverted history in the telling of the story, casting Jeanne in the role of the poor, innocent, misused and discarded aristocrat who is justified in her actions.  The truth was, Jeanne de la Motte was a whore and a thief, a con-woman who helped topple the monarchy and murder a queen.  For more information on the affair of the necklace, read Simon Schama's book Citizens, or visit the award-winning website, Let Them Eat Cake.
The costumes in this movie are phenomenal.  Truly eye candy.  If it weren't for the wonderful sets and splendid costumes, this movie would have rated a ZERO.",1026691200,63,1274,4.952830188679245
1296980,4,B00003CY5S,"The Affair of the Necklace is an entertaining and lavish retelling of the infamous scandal, in the years just prior to the outbreak of the French Revolution, that invloved a disgraced countess, a lecherous cardinal, the Queen of France, and a fabulous diamond necklace.
Hillary Swank plays the Comtesse de la Motte Valois, the daughter of a disgraced and murdered nobleman who is obsessed with reclaiming her title and her lands.  Though married to a rakish philanderer, she falls in with a handsome though disreputable courtier named Rateux de Villet and the two hatch a ploy to use the rich and influential cardinal Rohan to buy the necklace, supposedly for Marie Antoinette, but in reality so that the Comtesse can use the diamonds to buy back her estate and reinstate her family's reputation.  Once the cardinal realizes he has been duped he sets out to bring down the conspirators, but before he can, he himself is accused of complicity in the affair, along with his shady and mysterious ""mystic"" advisor Count Cagliostro, played by an outrageously wonderful Christopher Walken.  The ensuing scandal enflames the country as the public, already resentful of the extravagance and indifference of the aristocracy, blame the ostentaciously elegant Antoinette as the true architect of the affair.  The resulting backlash over the scandal helps to ingnite the Revolution and sends Antoinette and Louis XVI to the guillotine.
The Affair of the Necklace has its faults, but overall it is engaging and beautifully filmed, with sumptuous  costumes and lavish sets.  Swank is a little out of her element as the noble Comtesse, but even her American accent and sometimes cheesy dialogue can be overlooked.  Walken is over-the-top but enjoyable as the charlatan seer Cagliostro, Jonathan Pryce is excellent as the sleazy cardinal Rohan, and Joley Richardson gives a good performance in her role as Marie Antoinette.  This is an enjoyable piece of historic drama.",1025222400,13,1954,5.1613924050632916
1296981,2,B00003CY5S,"As a long time Marie-Antoinette fan, I have studied closely her tragic story, particularly the infamous Affair of the necklace. When I saw the film poster a few weeks before the movie was actually released, I could barely hide my excitement.
I ended up tremenduously disappointed. If it had not been for the amazing costumes, the beautiful settings and Joely Richardson who plays a credible Marie-Antoinette (the 3 reasons why I am going to buy the DVD), I am not sure I would have watched until the end.
Let alone that the story is not historically accurate, the director never seems to know what he wants to make of his main character, Jeanne de la Motte (Hilary Swank). Is she the poor orphan trying to regain her tittle or the con artist who plotted to steal a stunning piece of jewellery for her own benefit? The script continuously struggles with those two options, and it reflects poorly on the end result.
The movie had the potential to match ""Dangerous Liaisons"" or ""Ridicule"". Instead, it turns into a farce, and not a credible one at that!",1025049600,10,1050,4.681081081081081

I don't believe the queen was innocent in much, and I will say I was disappointed in hearing other reviews claim this movie had no historic accuracy. Decided to watch the movie as that. A movie. Hillary Swank was...okay? For the character. I do think it would've been more interesting if she had played a villain rather the antagonist, and it would have suited her acting better given the dark scene where she's reviewing herself in the mirror. This movie was too melodramatic, though. I'm not giving it low stars for anything but. History is made in what people remember and record. If she was already given a bad rep, then that has carried. Whether or not she was I don't know. I feel the affair could have been taken to more interesting heights, however, and that they might have fared taking a more sinister turn with the story.

I""m not sure what they were going for in Hillary Swank's character and the hair style did little to help with that odd feeling that she was 'a woman out of time', but I cannot fault her acting for this as others did. She has become a bit typecast over the years, which is a shame. The character of the Cardinal was a rather typical caricature, but Jonathan Price did what he could with it and carried it off.

1297110,5,B00003CY5S,"Love the fact that this story is based on an actual events though it didn't hold true to very many of the details of the story.  For example Jeanne was born to a poor family though she was descended from a royal line.  So the whole thing about her beautiful home having been taken by the nobility for their own profit was not true.  Jeanne was a clever and unscrupulous individual and not the ill treated noble comtesse she pretended to be.

 I didn't care for the casting of Hilary Swank.  I would have cast a much more delicate beauty for this part, particularly as she was playing opposite Simon Baker whose stature was somewhat overwhelmed by hers.  But the acting was good on the part of the entire cast.  Though I would have, again, cast someone of a smaller stature  with less angular features as Marie Antoinette and I could go on.  It was a very entertaining film on the whole.  But don't assume you learned any historical facts from it because it was very contrived.",1461196800,5,976,4.4576271186440675

1297303,3,B00003CY5S,"The costumes are lavish, the sets lush and resplendent. The story is compelling: how a strange affair of court intrigue becomes part of a larger mosaic of incidences that will eventually bring down the French monarchy. As a backdrop to the main events of the film is the rising unrest of the French citizenry who are becoming more and more disillusioned with their monarchy. A couple of great actors, most notably Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Rohan, stand out. And yet, although much of the film is there, it is not quite all there. Unfortunately for all its splendor, the final piece needed to make the movie a triumph is lacking: a leading lady right for the part. And maybe some adjustments in the music department.

First the positives: Despite a number of misgivings, this film still has the one element I always look for in any film: is the story compelling enough that, at any given moment, I care about what will happen next and it is not obvious what will happen next? And this movie definitely possesses the required attribute. Few movies have this rather simple facet, and yet, for me, it is often what will make or break a film regardless of the genre. Films as diverse as Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, Amadeus, and The Sting have the notable quality of being unpredictable until the very end. These last examples are of course masterpieces of film-making where Necklace is not. It's a good film with a good story but not one that will make any critics' lists.

The story of The Affair of the Necklace is extremely complex involving a countess, the Cardinal of France, the Queen of France, a gigolo, a sorcerer/psychic, a couple of jewelers, a peasant actress, forged letters, and a necklace of tremendous value and prestige. From the start, we know who did it, and the story back-tracks to tell us how and why the intrigue was perpetrated.

Now the not-so-good news: Hillary Swank, a 2-time academy-award-winning actress, is miscast for the part. The rest of the cast acclimates relatively well to late 18th-century France except for her. At times she seems to be playing a character more akin to an early 20th-century debutante than an 18th-century former member of the aristocracy. At times, some of her scenes appear contrived to provoke pity. The character is portrayed on the more innocent and vulnerable side of the female-character spectrum. This seems a bit hard to swallow as this woman is also a mastermind behind an intrigue that may have contributed to the downfall of the aristocracy. Maybe someone like Helena Bonham-Carter would have been a better choice...

The music is also inconsistent. For the majority of the movie, 18th-century and even 17th-century music is heard which seems appropriate as this is a period picture. I noticed a brief excerpt from the Monteverdi Vespers of 1610 in one of the church scenes. At other times, ""original"" music sounding a lot like Enya is played which always ruins my ""disbelief"". It reminds me we are in a movie made a couple of centuries after the events that are taking place. The filmmakers would have probably saved a lot of time and money by sticking to period music and not hiring a composer who writes new age music.

That said, this is still a good film when good films are uncommon. Perfect, not by a long shot. The script? Inconsistent but has its moments. Absorbing? Definitely. If you like period pictures, particularly those portraying pre-1800 Europe, you will still get a lot out of The Affair of the Necklace.",1430179200,,3496,4.791044776119403

1297310,2,B00003CY5S,"Visually exciting as far as camera work and costuming but poor production. Narration, pacing, and even the soundtrack seems more appropriate for a made for tv movie. The acting is good but the script is poorly written. Throughout the movie we hear British slang and phrases. I found it funny that the actress who pretends to be queen has a sort of cockney accent in order to show that she's not a noblewoman with perfect speech. This is supposed to take place in France!

Very little of the movie is historically accurate, as pointed out by other reviewers. If it had been, it'd be a very short movie since we will never know many of the facts to do with the affair. There's a lot of scheming and plotting and a dramatic romantic element which is basically filler. In reality, very people are who they say they are, and this is no different. It would be nice if they'd make a movie based on the truth because in my opinion, it would be much more interesting than this.

Hillary Swank's accent is regrettable and her acting is over the top. I've seen her do MUCH better in her other films. She is lovely in the historical costumes and the wigs are wonderful. We see a young Hayden Panettiere as well who plays a sorrowful Jeanne very nicely. Adrian Brody is hilariously bad as a womanizer. I don't know if that was his intention but that's how it happened. I enjoyed the scene between him and doctor after being shot in the 'fleshy tissues'. Joely Richardson is a MUCH better Marie Antoinette than Kirsten Dunst but not as good as Diane Kruger. I enjoyed watching Joely Richardson very much and wished she had more scenes. She stole the movie from the other actors.

This movie is more sympathetic towards Jeanne than Antoinette and the queen is played as a bit callous, which was it's aim. This is touch and go with viewers who come to this movie after appreciating more sympathy towards the doomed queen in Sofia Coppola's version, or after reading sticky sweet historical fiction. I enjoy seeing many sides of the same story so this was enjoyable for me. Others may not enjoy seeing the queen they imagine in their minds the way she is portrayed here. In this film, everyone has blood on their hands in some way, but the movie tries to set up the viewer to believe that Jeanne was justified after losing her rightful home and being denied any true justice through 'proper channels'. But that was not necessarily the case if you've read anything about the subject.

Also, this makes it seem as if the affair sent the people over the edge towards regicide. In reality, before this ever even happened the people were rising up and making plans. The affair was not even truly the last straw. The revolution would have happened without this incident, because by that time things had gotten unbearable long before. It was a catalyst but not nearly a cause. If it hadn't been the necklace, it would have been something else.

Watch the movie with more than a grain of salt, use a whole shaker. Take in the gorgeous sets and costumes. Eat up the eye candy. But don't think too much about it.",1424131200,4,3085,4.5413669064748206

1297406,2,B00003CY5S,"With any movie based on historical events, one expects writers and directors to take certain liberties with the facts. Some fascinating bits of history have a very hard time fitting into a 2 hour movie, and movies designed to appeal to a wide audience can't operate on the assumption that every member of that audience knows the source material.
I get that.

What I don't get is the seemingly bizarre decision to alter Jeanne's background for this film. In my opinion, turning her into the tragic heroine daughter of a wronged noble family isn't just a far cry from her origins-- it makes the rest of the plot seem flimsy and dissatisfying. The original story would've made more sense and would've made for a far better movie that would've required less plot-spackle to smooth out. I've seen alterations made to save time, simplify things, or reduce the number of major characters. This is the first time I've seen alterations done just to make the creators work harder on a worse film.

Furthermore, the actual Affair is interesting largely because Jeanne wasn't anyone of note beforehand. She was a cunning, clever schemer, and ultimately ended up out of her depth. Her audacity is part of what makes her an interesting antiheroine. She knew what she wanted, and was a key player in a complicated and very nearly successful plot to get it. There aren't many people who can claim to have done what she did, even if it ultimately wasn't successful.
By contrast, there isn't much that's unique or interesting about a wronged character seeking revenge and a redemption of family honor. It seems a bit odd that a character like that would resort to an intrigue as morally questionable as the Affair of the Necklace (especially the way Jeanne's initially presented in this movie), and it's easy to anticipate the plot failing even if you aren't aware of the actual historical outcome.

Jeanne was opportunistic, ambitious, cunning, and propelled by greed. She doesn't need to be a good person to be an interesting one. In the hands of a capable writer and director, she doesn't even need to be a good person to evoke sympathy. This Jeanne is a Frankenstein's hodgepodge of wronged victim tropes that isn't just a disservice to the actual Jeanne, she's dull and undermines the plot. At the end of the day, she just makes a far better Danny Ocean than she does a Rob Roy.",1388966400,,2365,4.763414634146342

1297479,3,B00003CY5S,"This historic drama has an excellent cast with superb sets and costumes. The fundamental weakness of the film is that the heroine, Jeanne Valois-St. Remy was a criminal and the film tries to make her into a heroine fighting injustice. It just doesn't hold together when this young woman, supposedly wronged by the French royal family, seeks revenge because she was ignored. Her revenge is too self-serving to be credible, thus there remains a structural weakness in the plot and screenplay that just does not work with most viewers. The unfortunate aspect of the film is that it would have been a stronger film if it had been more historically accurate and shown Jeanne as a calculating criminal engaged in a scam. There has been much criticism of Hilary Swank's portrayal of Jeanne but I found that she does a credible job of acting with a script that lacked internal consistency.

The character of Marie-Antoinette was well played by Joely Richardson. Marie-Antoinette was the innocent victim of the entire scam since the public believed she secretly tried to purchase the necklace through Cardinal de Rohan because the country was in debt and such a purchase for the queen would have run against public opinion.

The character of Cardinal de Rohan was played well by Jonathan Pryce. The cardinal was a low-life of high birth. As a young bishop, he alienated Queen Maria-Theresa of Austria on a state visit to Vienna by trying to undermine the marriage arrangements between Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette and he also made a spectacle of himself in Vienna by his lavish womanizing. Years later he wishes to rise in the political structure but is stopped by the Queen. He is vulnerable to the complex scam created to deprive him of considerable funds to purchase the necklace, thinking it is for the queen. Pryce plays this gullible evil man very well.

Simon Baker does a great job playing the gigolo Retaux de Vilette and Adrian Brody is also good playing the husband of Jeanne, Count Nicholas De La Motte. Christopher Walker plays the shady magician and shaman Count Cagliostro. Brian Cox is excellent as the austere Minister Breteuil, the character that tries to figure out the scam and protect the royal family. Paul Brooke plays jeweler Brehmer. Brooke is an excellent character actor who has appeared in countless films. The entire cast was excellent.

The costumes were perfect and must have cost a fortune. The film supposedly cost 20 million dollars and the cast, costumes, and settings were all exceptional. It is a shame that the screenplay was distorted with some misplaced desire to make Jeanne into a heroine when the facts would have made more sense and given a better final product. In the end, the screenwriter, and thus the director, did not trust the intelligence of the viewer. They assumed they needed to make Jeanne into a sympathetic heroine rather than a complex conniving criminal. This was an error that undermined the entire project.",1357257600,,2961,4.927855711422846

1297548,4,B00003CY5S,"The reviewers were awfully hard on this one.  I must admit that I found it an excellent and fascinating entertainment, a stimulus to look into the historical sources as there are obviously inaccuracies.

I liked Swank's interpretation of the character.  She has a mission - perhaps even lying to herself, it is unclear - and needs a mentor to learn the ropes of the Court intrigues.  She finds one in a gigolo, for whom she also apparently grows to have genuine affection.  They form a team with her husband, to steal a necklace as a way to gain political clout.  Along the way, they expertly con a corrupt Cardinal,  whom they play for a fool via his outsized ambitions and appetites, enlist a sleazily funny magician/seer to help, and create a scandal of historic proportions.  Once caught, everyone falls, including the monarchy.

What is so fun is the portrayal this offers of the way that government worked at the time, from aristocratic privilege to reward and punishment. in social and historical context.  I found it fascinating, though would have wanted much more detail, which I can only get from books.  The scandal was a catalyst that ended a monarchy that was rotten already.

Regarding the characters, the film adds much detail that can never be known.  Thus, it is historical fiction.  La Motte-Valois is ambitious and uses the levers available - sex, lies, and fraud.  We do not know what she personally thought, etc. I found the acting uniformly excellent and subtle, with many layers that can be peeled away at later viewings.  Perhaps she was a whore and simple con artist, perhaps her motives were noble to her.  I liked the mix of motivations and characters.  Her libertine husband is hilarious, her lover-mentor kind of sad in his love.  The house minister is convincingly shrewd.

Jeanne de Valois, who has reason to hate the royals, designs a scheme involving the 2800-carat necklace:  Using the ambitious and unsuspecting Cardinal de Rohan as a pawn, Jeanne comes to possess the jewels, but the plan backfires with disastrous results.

The movie is based on a true story, but the facts are twisted and the plot so complicated that I had a hard time understanding it or even caring.  Jeanne should have been the villain of the case, but instead she's made to be a pathetic victim and brave heroine, and it doesn't make sense.  The narration tells us that the affair of the necklace was a huge contributing factor in Marie Antoinette's downfall, but there's nothing in the plot to show this.

The casting of Hillary Swank as Jeanne and Adrien Brody as her husband was a big mistake; they're both too contemporary and ungainly to play in this delicate period piece and they look out of place.

1297553,4,B00003CY5S,"""L'Affaire du Collier"" may be based upon a true story, but it is also an enthralling historical romance, ""The Queen's Necklace,"" by Alexandre Dumas, who certainly had more than the ""Three Musketeers"" up his sleeve. Dumas relates the identical story of Joseph Balsamo (aka Count Cagliostro), Jeanne de la Motte Valois, the lecherous but charming Cardinal de Rohan and the great diamond scam, although the movie makers give Dumas no credit whatsoever (I note that the book is available on Amazon.com, and I highly recommend it!).

The costume designer, Malena Canonero, deserves plaudits for the swathes of silks, satins, and lace jabots that recreate the opulence of the 18th-century court of Louis XVI magnificently. The settings are also splendid. I found much of the music jarring, however, in that the composer insisted on giving it a modern beat at times, and also used a mish-mash of Mozart's ""Requiem,"" among other things. I find such cuts and rearrangement of a bar here; a bar there, to be both lazy and a bit of a cheat. In the featurette, the director explained that he wanted to make the period ""accessible"" to modern audiences. Such ""accessibility"" not only insults the intelligence of the modern audience but also weakens the movie.

Because the story is so strong, I nevertheless enjoyed the film. I was particularly impressed with the performances of Jonathan Pryce as the suave Cardinal, Adrien Brody as Jeanne's feckless husband, and Simon Baker, who is especially engaging as her love interest. All of them are believable and move well in their silks. Although Hilary Swank is an excellent actress, I thought she was miscast in this role. She looks a trifle uncomfortable in her costume and moves more like a woman of the twenty-first century rather than one of the eighteenth.

1297604,3,B00003CY5S,"The Affair of the Necklace is a surprising film for one that falls within the dreaded period piece genre.  Whenever I watch films of this nature I typically feel like I have seen the story time and time again.  A mismatched couple finds love together, only to have some tragedy befall them by the end of the film.  It is the classic ""Pride & Prejudice"" scenario mixed with a blend of ""Wuthering Heights"".  It is sad because for a very long time Hollywood couldn't release a period piece film that redefined the genre.  Most viewers avoided these types of films because of the clich nature coupled with the dull, monotonous acting that could only be accomplished by a short-list of actors.  To me the genre is painful, but The Affair of the Necklace doesn't seem to fit within that age-old mold.  What makes this film stand out from the rest within the genre is the fact that screenwriter John Sweet gives us deception and intrigue with our characters, coupled with a story that you would see in typical mainstream cinema.  While it may be based on a true event, Sweet's story, coupled with the decent eye of director Charles Shyer (of Baby Boom fame) gives us a modern twist instead of the stale comradery that this genre is commonly used to.  The Affair of the Necklace stands proudly on its own.

What makes this film stand out is that Shyer doesn't hide anything from us.  This can be both a positive and a negative because it doesn't keep you guessing until the end.  You know what is going to happen, it isn't sympathetic in nature, but instead demonstrates the power of the human desire and the corruption of the human ""need"".  What I found interesting about this film is the contrast between the class that Swank tries to fit within and that of the upper class citizens of Versailles.  All that she wants is to be a part of her family's history, which is that of wealthy and social standing, while it is that upper class that ultimately destroys the reputation of France.  Swank's character Jeanne is shown to become a symbol of the common class, but in reality she is just trying to reach up into a wide open sky.  The struggle then becomes rather confusing as Shyer wants us to feel sympathy for the obvious villain (Pryce) or are we to feel sympathy for the central character, Swank, which commits evil deeds for her own self righteousness.  While some will argue that this is a downfall to the film, I kind of enjoyed it.  I liked seeing my mind flutter between the two, knowing that one seems evil and the other is evil.  It was creative for this period piece to see the story unfold from the eyes of the thief instead of the savior.  This worked until the end, when Shyer demanded sympathy from us and, in my case, found none.  By the end, I could not care what happened to Swank because she had it coming to her all along, from the beginning we see her mind reacting to situations, and this one happened to put her in the hypothetical ""hot seat"".  It was this internal struggle with this film that really made Shyer's outing stand apart from the rest in the genre.

While I liked Shyer's film, it was his choice of actors that I need to fault as why it isn't a perfect film.  While I would agree with most film critics that Swank is an actress that is not afraid of sinking her teeth into a role, I did feel that this singular role was not made for her shoes.  Swank seems ""silly"" as Jeanne, attempting to bring a level of emotion to a character that felt more snobbish and jealous than honest.  Her smile, her actions, her sex-appeal just wasn't prevalent in this film, nor did it work.  This was her first feature role after Boys Don't Cry, and I think that Shyer really just wanted to ride the Oscar bandwagon, without thinking further within his character.  Pryce is ... well ... Pryce.  If you have seen one of his period piece films, then you have seen him in this one.  I think directors know he looks like someone from that period, so he is instantly cast.  Simon Baker is a decent choice to play the gigolo; he seems to have the smile that could melt women.  Adrien Brody seemed to come out from left field for this film.  He is a great actor, but he was used as a classic ""reveal"" in this film.  A surprise known actors comes in during the center of the film to bring viewers out of the possible sleep they could be facing.  Christopher Walken, a actor that I believe rules this generation of cinema, was odd in this film.  I kept waiting for him to yell, ""COWBELL, this film needs more COWBELL"".  He wore a strange mustache and odd hair, but was fun none the less.  Alas, Antoinette herself could have been better played than through the eyes of Joely Richardson.  While she may be a decent actress, this was just too goofy for her.  We needed a stronger female actress in this role.  While I loved Sweet's story, it was Shyer's choice of casting that really hurt the overall sensation of this film.

Overall, I could suggest this film to friends and family.  I don't think I could watch it again, but it was definitely worth the two hours spent in front of the television.  I thought, outside of the performances, that the cinematography was beautiful, the change of direction from your normal period piece drama was a breath of fresh air, and that Shyer did a decent job of placing a new spin on a tired genre.  There are some major sparks to this film, but it just didn't light a full fire in my eyes.  I loved the opening music as well.  The addition of Alanis Morissette's hypnotic voice to the opening and closing to this film added a strong undertone that set the pace for the rest of the film.  It was a strong film for Shyer; I am not here to disown it in any way.  I want others to see this film, but I don't think I could watch it again.  Redefining a genre is smart, but Shyer could have strengthened his directing arm a bit more by adding crucial actors to better roles and a stronger empathy towards one true character instead of a big switch midway through the film.  Again, I liked it, but didn't love it.

1297605,3,B00003CY5S,"Director Charles Shyer's lone Oscar nomination came for Best Original Screenplay in 1980 for ""Private Benjamin.""  He's since made a career with comedies such as ""The Parent Trap"" & ""Father of the Bride, I & II.""  He continued to branch out with the Jude Law/Susan Sarandon remake of ""Alfie,"" which I liked.  This film was his first ""serious"" drama, although for much of the film I thought it was going to be a comedy crime caper set in historical France.  The major problem with the film is that the disparate elements work against each other.

Hilary Swank is one of those rare actresses who gained prominence on TV's ""90210"" for a year and has then garnered two Best Actress Oscars in two nominations, ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999) & ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004).  Whether it squares with history or not, Jeanne de la Motte Valois is played as a heroic scoundrel, using intrigue and deception to right a wrong.  Maybe we could see her as a female Zorro, a vigilante hero.  However, the trial at the end tries to crescendo with great sympathy for this character, but the film simply didn't build to that.  I expected her to pull another fast one to escape.

Simon Baker who has been on CBS' new ""Smith"" series and had a Golden Globe nomination in 2001 for his role on TV's ""The Guardian"" does a good job as the tongue-in-cheek gigolo who's willing to take risks for romance.  His light touch makes us root for him to get the girl.  While his other film projects like ""Something New,"" ""The Devil Wears Prada"" & ""Ring 2"" have shown both comic and dramatic skills, the prison beating and his final scene being dragged out of the courtroom don't seem to match with the narration that he never saw Jeanne again.  We wanted them to get together.

Adrien Brody whose Best Actor Oscar is for ""The Pianist"" does a credible job as the rascal husband.  The script gives us teasers about the attraction between the two, but doesn't let Swank & Brody really burn the bridges or explore all the levels.

Christopher Walken does a good job as the hocus pocus Count.  With his Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1978 for ""The Deer Hunter,"" Shyer certainly had an award-winning cast with which to work!

Joely Richardson who reflects some of her mother Vanessa Redgrave's features does an excellent job as Marie Antoinette.  I've enjoyed her so much on the ""Nip & Tuck"" TV show as Julia that when I heard her voice, I immediately identified her as the same actress.  She does a nice job of being superficial, plotting, determined and then defeated as she loses her head.

Jonathan Pryce, who I will always probably think of in James Bond, does a good job being the sleazy Cardinal Louis de Rohan.  Milena Canonero has the film's sole Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design.  As a whole, this is an entertaining film.  If you allow yourself to rise above the flaws, it is a worthwhile evening of entertainment.  Enjoy!",1161129600,3,2893,4.625490196078432
1297606,2,B00003CY5S,"I understand that historic episodes adapted into film must be changed to a certain degree in order to be viewable in the movie theaters. However, in this case, real History is far more interesting and complex than the horror they made when writting the script of this movie and this is why:

-In the movie, Jeanne de la Motte descended from the Valois royal family, and her wealthy father got killed because he wanted people to be free and he could lay claim to the French throne...False! In reality, Jeanne claimed to descend from an Ilegitimate son of Henri II  of Valois(The Bastard of Angouleme) which means her father had no legal rights on the French throne. Moreover, her father was a drunk in real life and her mother was a prostitute.

-In the movie Jeanne also is presented as a victim of the Monarchy, by writting her memoirs. The movie doesn't mention however that Jeanne falsely implicated Marie Antoinette in the Affair of the Necklace and she blackmailed her up untill the revolution. The Queen was innocent of everything.

In other words, the movie presents a rather innocent almost angelic Jeanne de la Motte when in reality she was a far darker, more corrupted woman who never stopped intriguing untill the time of her death.

The only thing worth seeing about this movie are the costumes and sets: they are extremely accurate and they got the chance to film some scenes in Versailles which is very rare.

Let's hope Sofia Coppola makes this story more justice in her upcoming picture ""Marie Antoinette""...",1152057600,72,1524,4.775665399239544
1297607,3,B00003CY5S,"As a lover of costume dramas, I was disapointed that such an amazing cast could produce such a spirtless film. Hillary Swank, though a great actress, does little to breathe life into the her character, Jeanne Valois. Though she is supposed to evoke sympathy, besides a few flashbacks we see little that makes her life seem unbearable enough to fabricate the plot to steal the necklace. Most of the characters don't do enough to express their desires and passions, and the plan to steal the necklace seems quite muddled and doomed to fail. One exception is Johnathan Bryce's Cardinal Rohan, the only character I felt was truly three dimentional. In addition to faulty performances, the script tries too hard to wrap up and affair that seems too complicated to neatly summarize in blurbs at the end of the film. All of a sudden, we see Marie Antoinette being executed, with a narrative voice that says something to the effect of ""And that was the end of Marie Antoinette."" Duh. She's in a guillotine. We miss all the steps of her getting there, however. This film seems to loosly tackles an inticate subject, and proves a thoroghly mediocre affair. Costuming was probably the strongest point, which isn't saying all that much.",1150588800,5,1224,4.833333333333333
1297608,4,B00003CY5S,"On page 203 of CITIZENS: THE CHRONICLE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION by Simon Schama, begins Chapter Six 'Body Politics' which gives an account of the tale upon which this film is based. The film is very close to this account. Schama himself would suggest that the retelling of an historical event is biased and depends on who is doing the telling.  Several of the principle players left diaries or journals that provided their version of events.  The trial of Cardinal de Rohan, Jeanne de La Motte, Nicole Le Guay and others concerning 'The Diamond Necklace Affair' was also recorded in court records and the newspapers of the day. Each of their lawyers presented a story that best represented their clients point of view.

The sad truth is that the incident was only one of many that led to the demise of the monarchy, not ""the cause"" as the film suggests.  What really happened?  The French populace believed the worst of Antoinette and the whole incident proved to be another nail in her coffin.  According to Schama, it was ""her reputation for unaffected girlish sentimentality that made Louis, the Cardinal de Rohan, believe that he could restore his position at court through her favors...""

This film is well enough acted the lead fellow (Simon.....) was a murder victim in L.A.CONFIDENTIAL, Brody is the Count de la Motte, and of course Swank who plays the 'Baronne de La Motte de Valois (as she called herself),is well known.  Most of the supporting actors are also fairly well known to BBC fans, and Christopher Walken is wonderful as the occultist Cagliostro. This is not a swash-buckling tale (one silly sword fight), nor is is a Merchant-Ivory production, but it is far lighter than some of the 'realist' dramas produced by others in recent years.

Her character was poorly played by a fabulous actress, Hilary Swank.  The gigolo was the highlight performance of the film, and Robert Price as Cardinal Rohan was superb as always.

Christopher Walken didn't fit the film, neither did Joely Richardson or Swank.  They seemed so oddly out of place.

If the screenwriters had made Jeanne just a little more like the lead protagonist/heroine in Philippa Gregory's WIDEACRE, you love to hate her and you love her, we all would have enjoyed the film better.

1297610,3,B00003CY5S,"This historical drama is very nearly fabulous - but just misses it. It is a famous tale of intrigue and scandal, one that lent fiery fuel to Marie Antoinette's bad reputation, which in turn led to her beheading. It is the story of Countess Jeanne St. Remy Valois, played by Hilary Swank in her first role after winning an Oscar for *Boys Don't Cry*. Perhaps the point was to see how Miss Swank could act while wearing a dress, but the results are mixed, to say the least. Made out to be completely sympathetic, the Countess sees her father murdered and their property taken from them, and she wishes to avenge the wrong done to them. Begging for an audience with the Queen (Joely Richardson *is* fabulous as Marie Antoinette), the Countess is rebuffed. Meanwhile, in an unrelated episode, the Queen's jewelers have designed a magnificent diamond necklace, but the Queen, though she allegedly covets the necklace, does not purchase it, leaving the jewelers in a tight spot. The Countess falls in with an attractive courtier and also forms an alliance with Cardinal de Rohan (played magnificently by Jonathon Pryce), who is out of favor with the Queen, and convinces him to buy the necklace to smooth things over between them. Of course, the Countess is planning on stealing the necklace so that she may live happily ever after. Through machinations such a stolen letterhead, mistaken identities and other deceptions, the story comes to a boil when the details of the scandal begin to see the light of day, and unravels the careers of everyone concerned (especially Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette). It is a gripping story in the right hands. Clearly director Charles Shyer's oeuvre is comedy, and he's written, directed or produced many fine ones, such as *Private Benjamin*, *Irreconcilable Differences*, *Father of the Bride* and *The Parent Trap*. But historical drama is not his long suit. The supporting cast, cinematography, costumes and art direction are superb and engaging, but Swank is the weak link in the equation. She is simply not skilled enough to handle the role - she is passionless and wooden, but fortunately there are many scenes without her that sizzle with drama. All in all, there is a great deal of entertainment here, and if you though Hilary Swank was good in *Beverly Hills 90210*, then you'll love her in this.",1106438400,19,2336,4.886649874055416
1297611,3,B00003CY5S,"This film tries to make a believable drama out of what was in fact one of the most hopelessly bungled con jobs in history.  While the Affair of the Necklace did, indeed, help to blacken Marie Antoinette's reputation, it didn't do all that much new damage; as Hilary Swank's character remarks near the end of the film, the king and queen had already pretty much ruined the monarchy well before 1785-86, when the events of the story actually took place.

Overall the outlines of the plot are accurate in so far as the actual swindle is concerned, but the film has one unforgivable deliberate fault.

The historical Jeanne de Lamotte-Valois (to use her correct birth name, Jeanne de St-Remy) was indeed descended from one of the many illegitimate sons of the Valois king Henri II, who died more than 200 years before Jeanne got her hands on that necklace.  Jeanne's ancestor was legitimized and created baron de St-Remy; his offspring used that surname and not the royal Valois name--Jeanne herself used it to give herself some social leverage, and then added it to her husband's surname, Lamotte.  Otherwise the film's representation of Jeanne's background is false.

Nicolas de Lamotte was not a genuine count any more than Jeanne was the unfairly dispossessed daughter of a high-minded socially reforming baron killed by the government.  Her father was a wastrel and drunkard who, before his early death, gambled away whatever was left of the family fortune (and it wasn't much to begin with).  Jeanne had a brother and sisters, though none of them seems to have come to much good.  Her mother was an illiterate peasant, not a member of the noble class.

All the folderol about Jeanne's idyllic childhood in the family chateau, and her determination to win it back, was apparently added by the film's writer and producers to whitewash Jeanne's otherwise disreputable story. Simply put, she was an adventuress and a con woman whose real social standing was typified by the ease with which she and her husband found a prostitute to impersonate the queen during the midnight meeting with Cardinal de Rohan in the gardens of Versailles.

While most of the events the film represents are accurate, the story thus rests upon heavily fictionalized foundations. The film's unevenness, however, is not exclusively for that reason.

Its main drawback is Swank, who lacks the dramatic presence for a film of this nature.  She looks nothing like an eighteenth-century Frenchwoman and fails to create a remotely believable characterization of such a woman.  Some of the other characters succeed rather better, especially the House Minister, Baron de Breteuil, and Jeanne's lover, Retaux de Villette, who forged the real queen's correspondence with Cardinal de Rohan (a third excellent performance).

Unfortunately the other weak spot here is Joely Richardson's Marie Antoinette.  Not that Richardson is not a bad actress--for that matter, neither is Swank. But both are out of their element here.  Richardson tumbles into every pitfall that awaits when as heavily-cliched an historical figure as Marie Antoinette is portrayed.  Her performance gives the beleaguered queen no hint of humanity, though we know that the queen was in fact troubled by her unpopularity though she never understood how to reverse it.  Richardson can be seen to much better advantage in the TV series ""Nip/Tuck"" and Swank in pretty much every other film she has ever made--just not this one.

Costumes, sets and photography are excellent across the board.  But the sound track is dominated by the music of Georg Frideric Handel, a Germano-British composer who died nearly 20 years before the events in the film took and whose splendid music by the 1780s was hardly ever heard outside England.  Marie Antoinette was fond of works by Haydn, Gluck, Mozart and-auugh!-Salieri, and their music would have been much more appropriate here than Handel's.",1102896000,20,3909,5.084507042253521

With the help of a court women-chaser, Baker, she uses the Cardinal's desire for Marie Antoinette, and the luxurious diamond necklace that comes into place, to get what she wants.
As lies are told, and people pretending to be someone else, the grand plot begins to resemble a tower of playing cards that can topple at any moment.

Perhaps it was the haughty elegance of this period in time that made me watch this movie from start to finish. Maybe it was the dashing Simon Baker, or the intriging Adrien Brody. It was certainly not, I assure you, because of Hillary Swank.
Perhaps that isn't fair of me. After all, it would be a hard task to make such a controversial and not very admirable person in history someone you can be empathetic towards. For my part, I felt that Swank's character was not fiery enough to like, not pathetic enough to feel sorry for, and certainly not emotional enough to feel sad for. As for Simon Baker; one moment, a flirtatious gigalo who helps Swank through her scandalous plan. The next moment, he's a romantic hero sacrificing everything in the name of love. And Adrien Brody, an almost comical character that is vengeful and then willing to join the scandal about, oh, five seconds later. Marie Antoinette's protrail was well done, but suprisingly, not a key factor in the overall plotline. Why?

Over all I really like this period film.  It takes place a short time prior the the fall of the french monarchy and the demise of its King and Queen.  Allegedly the demise was helped by the historically noted affair of the necklace.

(The story is ostensibly based on a actual historical event. But when Hollywood acts as the filter, one is perhaps justified in lifting a skeptical eyebrow.)
Hilary Swank plays Comtesse Jeanne de la Motte-Valois, the direct descendent of a previous French monarch, whose family, the Valois, was stripped of its lands and title by the current King Louis XVI in a spasm of royal vengeance. Now, wanting the family estate back, our heroine haunts Versailles seeking an audience for her petition. But the King carries a grudge, so no lackey of his with any power is prepared to listen. Then Jeanne meets Retaux de Vilette (Simon Baker), a young and handsome court insider who advises her to learn what the movers and shakers want. With that knowledge, she can leverage what she wants.
Well, as it so happens, there's this ab fab diamond necklace that a couple of fawning jewelers wish to sell to Queen Marie Antoinette (Joely Richardson), otherwise they're out the considerable costs associated with the stones' acquisition. But Marie, knowing it was originally crafted for another Babe, scorns the offer. She only wants the Paris Mob, which desires her head on a platter (so to speak), off her back. Then there's Cardinal Louis de Rohan (Jonathan Pryce), who otherwise spends his time giving willing young mademoiselles, um, energetic one-on-one religious instruction. The good Cardinal wants to be made Prime Minister, an office apparently within the gift of the Queen, but she's hated his guts for years. Finally, there's Count Cagliostro (Christopher Walken), a friend of de Rohan's and reputedly a powerful seer of future events, who's willing to spin a good vision if the price is right. Now sufficiently educated, the Comtesse hatches a scam with de Vilette and her own philandering and usually absent husband (Adrien Brody) to get her birthright back.
As I've said, one will perhaps appreciate THE AFFAIR OF THE NECKLACE only after accepting the dubious premise of profound gullibility on the part of France's #1 Catholic primate, and Jeanne's incredible naivet&eacute; in believing her house of cards won't collapse in the first breeze of scrutiny. Swank's de la Motte is pretty and vulnerable, but perhaps too innocent as the injured and righteous party to be real.  Pryce has the most interesting role as the randy, ambitious and impressively liveried prelate. Indeed, the film's costuming is first rate. And there are memorable visuals, as the meeting between Jeanne and Marie Antoinette in the courtyard of the Bastille in gently flurries of snow, and the progress of a marvelously caped de Rohan down an ornate courtier-filled hall after being tossed out of a royal audience.

Marie Antoinette was not at all interested in this necklace and made herself quite clear to the somewhat desperate jewelers, who had invested much of their capital in this necklace.
In the film, a young woman, Jeanne St. Remy de Valois (Hilary Swank), who called herself a Countess by virtue of her marriage of convenience to a certain rake, Nicolas de La Motte (Adrien Brody), wanted to get back her father's estates, which had been taken by the crown after he had been, she believed, wrongfully executed for his perceived political beliefs. She was obsessed with righting this wrong and regaining her family's lost honor.
When she was unable to secure that which she so desired, she took up with a court gigolo, Retaux de Vilette (Simon Baker). With his assistance, she concocted an elaborate scheme, rife with political intrigues, and secured possession of the notorious diamond necklace under the ostensible color of Queen Marie Antoinette's authority. This theft ultimately came to light, and she and her cohorts were  arrested in this matter, although the necklace was never recovered. This would lead to a sensational trial, because her accused accomplice in the matter was none other than Cardinal Louis Constantin de Rohan (Jonathan Pryce), a prince of France.
The film, woodenly directed by Charles Shyer, centers around the character, Jeanne. Unfortunately, Hilary Swank is unable to carry the day. Her portrayal of Jeanne is one dimensional. She also seques back and forth between her obvious American accent and a pseudo-British one. To sum up her performance in a nutshell, it is sub-par. An otherwise excellent actress, she is simply out her element in this period film, because she is unable to overcome her contemporary veneer.
Of course, as she is the centerpiece of the film and fails, so does the film, no matter how well meaning the endeavor.  Of course, she had help, as the script has its problems. There is very little tension for a film that is about one of the greatest thefts ever conceived. Not even the delicious performance of Jonathan Pryce, as the dissolute Cardinal de Rohan, can overcome some of the fundamental flaws in this film. Still, there are some intriguing moments in the film, and those who enjoy period pieces and historical dramas may get a modicum of enjoyment viewing it.",1032048000,16,3011,5.02
1297718,3,B00003CY5S,"Based on a true story, this tale of a young woman's quest to regain the family property falters primarily because of Hilary Swank. A fine actress in contemporary American films, she lacks the gravity, passion and underlying rage that should have driven this character. Instead, she brings a too-modern sensibility to the film that is glaringly out of place. The other performers, Simon Baker (who is simply wonderful in TV's The Guardian) and Brian Cox (the best Hannibal ever in Michael Mann's Manhunter, the film of Red Dragon) and Jonathan Pryce all do fine work. But given that Swank is the centerpiece of this affair, there just isn't sufficient glue to hold it all together and make one commit wholeheartedly to the film. Joely Richardson is sometimes tedious as Marie Antoinette, sometimes a bit believable. But her performance, too, is lacking.
The film is worth seeing for the sets and costumes and for its historical significance, but is, overall, disappointing.",1030492800,4,972,5.08125
1297719,4,B00003CY5S,"I enjoyed this film. In pre-Revolutionary France, as a child, Hilary Swank's parents are murdered and robbed stemming from her father's political view against the government. Deprived of her heritage, she, as an adult, begins a trek to reacquire her family's estate and punish those who were responsible for the unjust death of her parents.  In her quest, the infamous necklace is the centerpiece of a ruse. A lavish necklace that is not hers, is used as a lure in a complex plot to expose the avarice archbishop. Hilary provides a fine performance.",1029542400,,549,4.903225806451613

The movie was wonderful and the acting was very good. Many scenes in the movie have a dramatic feel to it that really sets up your emotions. The music is also powerful. If you like history or movies made by true events then I surely recommend people buy this film. When watching this movie you need to pay attention to the diagloue. Missing one scene could get you confused. If you seen it once and didn't like it I recommend you watch it again (alone if possible) and listen carefully.
