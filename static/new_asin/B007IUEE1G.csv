5089877,4,B007IUEE1G,This is an interesting film. I had seen it on PBS and decided I wanted to own it because it is one of those films that you can watch many times and still learn something from.,1384041600,4,175,3.888888888888889
5089878,4,B007IUEE1G,"UPDATE 03Sep2017: I've increased my rating to 4 stars (from 3). The title is a little bit misleading, and there are some ""misinterpretations"" (or perhaps differences in traditions) expressed as fact by some of the interviewees. But I've come to appreciate the interviews and the basics expressed. Perhaps my interests have changed (less about archaeology and more about inspiration?)

Many people love this film. There is much to appreciate:  Beautiful sites, beautifully filmed.  The narrator has a great on-screen presence: She is approachable, cheerful, and unpretentious.

Three stars means ""It's okay"" and here's why:  I liked it, but her explorations of very important Buddhist concepts were surface-level and simplified. I'm not suggesting she should have spent 10 years as a nun in order to better understand and convey these concepts, but a little more digging, reading, interview, or dialog would have revealed a much richer world for the viewer, if not for the narrator.  It's as though she rushed through the research.

Also, though the sites were exquisite, and I don't know where better choices could have been found, there seemed to be a degree of flashy modernism some of them (Hong Kong and LA come to mind), which made me wish she had filmed sites that are either (a) more historically significant, (b) more at risk of being destroyed by erosion or ignorance, or (c) more challenging for the average international tourist to visit.

You can go visit all the places she visited, do all the things she did, and learn even more than she learned.  So I was not wowed by the locations, and was not impressed with the depth of investigation.  Like I said in the title of this review:  As a travelogue, it's stunning.  As a documentary, it's lacking.

Last word:  I'm going to keep my copy, if only for the best video of Mahabodhi temple I have ever seen. :-)

Update:  I just finished watching John Bush's ""Dharma River,"" and I will be adding a review shortly. It was much more of what I was expecting from ""Seven Wonders"":&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journey-Into-Buddhism-Dharma-River/dp/B000T4SX9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journey Into Buddhism: Dharma River</a>",1378080000,9,2226,5.299145299145299
5089879,5,B007IUEE1G,"Seven Wonders takes viewers on a tour of seven various historical and modern Buddhist sites - in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, China, and the United States - and along the way introduces a bit of Buddhist history and the notion of the Triple Gem. The film's orientation on Buddhism is sympathetic but the program was not produced by any Buddhist organization nor does it proselytize. When compared with other documentaries about Buddhism, specifically one that was shown on US television some time ago, this film has the advantage of avoiding covert political propaganda over the Dalai Lama and his role (he is simply not mentioned) and it also has the virtue - as I see it, at least - of focusing on mainstream Buddhism rather than on trendy, ""new age"" versions. Relying on interviews with academic scholars and Buddhist practitioners - Buddhist nuns, in particular - the film doesn't delve too deeply into the more intricate doctrines of Buddhist philosophy. Major distinctions between Buddhism and the theistic religions are briefly touched on but not emphasized. Essentially, Seven Wonders offers a non-controversial look at what Buddhists in various parts of the world - for the most part, in Asia - 'get out of' Buddhism.",1364947200,2,1242,5.0634146341463415

5089881,4,B007IUEE1G,"This is a pleasant intro to Buddhism and Buddhist wonders = holy sites.  It addresses the basics of Buddha's life path and how acolytes formed their own schools of study and guidance.  It also addresses in a general way the idea of Dharma (what most people want to know).  Talking heads are given limited time and the emphasis is on seeing the products of belief and ""life way"" as well as the process of those so engaged.  Buddhism's relevance to the modern world and its stressors is nicely highlighted.  Anyone interested in a brief intro to this topic will get just enough info to ponder and plenty of eye candy to delight.",1354147200,9,626,4.553571428571429
5089882,5,B007IUEE1G,"Buddhism is so multi-faceted and complex that it's difficult to get a good video on it.  This one succeeds!  The reviewer, Britisher Bettany Hughes, visits 7 famous Buddhist sites and ties them in with basic Buddhis beliefs.  She is a good speaker, and the program is well planned.  She has also chosen sites that are generally quite spectacular and which will hold the viewer's attention.  I find the architecture of some of the Buddhist temples particularly superb; I am not good at art, and I have the utmost admiration for those who are--and some of the buildings in this video will blow most viewers' minds; I know they did mine!  Beautifully filmed, well paced, and strongly recommended.",1341964800,19,693,4.880341880341881
5089883,5,B007IUEE1G,"With the wonderful Bettany Hughes as our guide, it's hard to go wrong. What sets her programs apart is that she actually takes us to those places and tries to get to he heart of the subject. The photography is stunning.",1338681600,13,219,4.365853658536586

8517937,1,B007IUEE1G,"Bettany Hughes is so unconnected with the Asian Buddhist world she wandered around that she could not pronounce Sri Lanka properly thru a whole segment of her odyssey.  Nor would she stoop to pronounce Bangkok like Thais and foreigners alike.  If she couldn't understand the ""sound"" of Asia, how was she to feel the inner passion of Buddhism.  It isn't statues or monuments or temple complexes (and I'm not a Buddhist).  It's about how we see ourselves in each of our worlds.  If you mute all Ms. Hughes' blather and just listen to the folks who try to explain THEIR sense of Buddhism ... this video is worth at least three stars.  But having experienced Buddhism living in both rural Thailand and Bangkok for two years, fifty years ago; having returned to Thailand countless times since AND seen the people at Buddhist shrines from Angkor to Hong Kong to Japan's first temple and giant Buddha at Kamakura ...

8517942,5,B007IUEE1G,"Although this DVD contains some isolated imperfections, it's a terrific and imaginative introduction to Buddhism - to Buddhist cultural sites (""wonders""), yes, but basically to Buddhism itself.  This DVD's few minuses are overwhelmed by the aggregate of positives.

This DVD is particularly important because it provides a view of Buddhism from a ""Western"" point of view.

This DVD is packed with great information about Buddhism. I've done this in my life only four times before with other DVDs: I meticulously transcribed by hand the narration and commentary of the entire DVD, and utilized relevant entries from THE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF WORLD RELIGIONS to flesh out aspects of the commentary effectively delivered by this DVD's engaging host, Bettany Hughes.  In this lengthy transcription process, I obtained quite an education in Buddhism, which I could not have done on my own without the basis provided by this DVD's content.

This DVD is well conceived, by utilizing each of the ""seven wonders"" as a basis to illustrate a certain basic  belief of Buddhism - e.g., the example of the life of the Buddha, the Sangha (the Buddhist monastic community), karma, samsara, meditation, Zen, and enlightenment.

An excellent feature of this DVD are the well-chosen ""guest"" commentators, including both ""Westerners"" and English-speaking Asians, both scholars and native Buddhists - particularly including two sequences of one Thai girl, at the Wat Po temple in Bangkok, who (speaking in a language, English, which is foreign to her own) found nothing complicated about Buddhism (i.e., a mix of the Buddhist concepts of samsara, karma, dukkha, and glorious impermanence) when explaining her own understanding of Buddhism.  I would have liked to hear what this Thai girl has to say about Buddha-dharma.

This DVD's high-caliber (and usually scholarly) commentators keep a viewer's concentration anchored and focused on the fact that this DVD is basically about Buddhism - a reinforcing focus, which enables viewers to avoid becoming fundamentally distracted by the seductive beauty of the ""seven wonders"" and of their exotic locales, and exotic native Buddhist populations.

Throughout this DVD, this DVD's hostess, Bettany Hughes, pointedly and repeatedly refers to Buddhism as a ""belief system"" and a ""philosophy,"" rather than as a ""religion"" - thank you, Bettany Hughes.

On the (minor) minus side, Bettany Hughes says that Buddhism is a ""difficult"" philosophy ""to explain,"" and the same for the central Buddhist concept of Dharma, (assertions I subsequently felt are misleading, and with neither of which do I now, in retrospect, concur).  Bettany Hughes also asks the extremely cogent question: ""Is Zen very different from other forms of Buddhism?"" - a question I don't believe this DVD answers, even by an English-speaking Asian, Zen Buddhist commentator!  That Asian commentator describes Zen in terms which I think of as being characteristic of all Buddhism.

If Bettany Hughes had used the term ""Buddha-Dharma"" rather than just ""Dharma,"" and knew what ""Buddha-Dharma"" means, she may not have found the Dharma concept ""difficult.""

Regarding Buddhism being a difficult philosophy to explain (at least in terms of broad theory), after 2,500 years, Buddhists certainly have Buddhism boiled down into exceedingly simple formulas, for example: the ""Three Jewels,"" the ""four encounters,"" the ""four noble truths,"" the ""eightfold path,"" the ""three marks of existence,"" the ""three liberations"" as well as the ""eight liberations"" of Buddhist meditation, the ""three poisons,"" and the term ""Buddha-Dharma"" (""Buddha"" being a modifier of ""Dharma"") - see THE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF WORLD RELIGIONS, for more.

After completing my project of transcribing and fleshing out the script of this DVD, I felt exactly the same way about Buddhism as expressed by John Bush, in his DVD entitled JOURNEY INTO BUDDHISM: VAJRA SKY OVER TIBET, i.e., (upper case for emphasis): ""Buddhism ASTONISHED ME for the RELEVANCE of its CONTENTS to MODERN TIMES!""

NB:  No Tibetan Buddhist ""wonder"" is portrayed in this DVD, although the Boudhanath Stupa in Nepal is featured.  A significant portion of the Tibetan Buddhist ""diaspora"" is located in Nepal.  This DVD does feature the ""singing nun,"" a Tibetan Buddhist nun, who runs her own Buddhist monastery for girls (Sangha) in Katmandu, Nepal, and also serves as a commentator in the DVD.

RECOMMENDATION: As a companion to this ""SEVEN WONDERS"" DVD, I highly recommend another excellent DVD about Buddhism: THE BUDDHA: THE STORY OF SIDDHARTHA, a two-hour film by David Grubin, narrated by Richard Gere, and published (2010) by the Public Broadcast System (PBS).  I meticulously transcribed the oral text or script of this DVD as well.  At the time of this posting, there are already 218 ""customer reviews"" of the ""BUDDHA"" DVD posted on Amazon, indicating Buddhism's popularity, with an aggregate customer quality rating of four and a half stars out of a total of five stars, indicting a near universal judgement and endorsement of the highest quality of PBS's ""BUDDHA"" DVD.",1412380800,4,5088,5.340425531914893
8517943,3,B007IUEE1G,"Great footage with OK commentary by a historian who doesn't have a lot of depth in her understanding of Buddhism.  But something is very strange: Vajrayana Buddhism  one of the Three Vehicles along with Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism -- is never mentioned.  The map showing the historical spread of Buddhism from India does not show Tibet.  The only mention of Tibetan Buddhists is that ""there are lots of them in Nepal.""

8517945,3,B007IUEE1G,"This documentary visits various locations to showcase seven Buddhist monuments. The narrator, Bettany Hughes, tells the story of Buddhas life and how the religion Buddha started has spread throughout the world and led to the creation of beautiful architecture along the way.  Hughes explained some key elements of Buddhism such as the three jewels, kharma, samsara and nirvana. She was most useful in describing how the religion was reflected in the monuments created over the centuries.
 Several of the temples were familiar to me. I have never seen the golden reclining buddha in Bangkok but I have been to Thailand a few times and I saw how the people practiced Buddhism there. The movie explained that the Thai kings supported Buddhism and that the royal palace always had a section devoted to Buddhism. I have seen Angkor Wat and the Giant Buddha in Hong Kong, and I have been to LA, and so the temples in those places were most interesting to me. In Angkor Wat you were able to tell that the original religion expressed in the monuments was Hinduism and that many Buddhist elements were added as the religion spread to the Khmer people.
 The movie mentioned other facts about Buddhism that were new to me such as the use of relics like Buddhas tooth as the foundation of certain temples. This movies real strength was in describing the monuments of Buddhism and through that, teaching about some key aspects of the religion, and showing its wide appeal.",1400889600,,1459,4.828
