7903432,5,B000005O2C,Had this on VHS back in early 90's. Nice to have a newer version available.,1522368000,,75,4.066666666666666
7903433,5,B000005O2C,"Kiss My Ass is a great 90 min. tape of rare preformances! (the style is similar to ""metalica - cliff em all"" where its all shaky concert footage of cool songs.)
The quality is pretty shabby but kiss fans will quickly ignore it to see gene, paul, ace, eric and peter preformances. (for high quality videos see Exposed or pay ($$) for the so-called ""bootleg pro-shot concerts"".  Clips include:
1. Parasite: (1st tour) powerful and bold, peter keeps rhythm with the base drum
2. Do you love me: (destroyer, ny) bad angle shot but again an excelelent preformance.
3. Radioactive/move on: largo 1979-dynasty tour, rare songs played very well. aces glow in the dark gibson is cool. their costumes are dopey in this period.
4. love gun (92 revenge) - interesting sound stage that they preformed, a little older, wiser, haggard?
5. ny groove (largo 79 dynasty) hard rock and driving beat
6. She - anthrax - totally dumb. sounds the same as the album
7. makin love - 1977 destroyer - again bad angle, good preformance
8. christine sixteen - gin blossoms - not a fan of this band but a good track
9. I love it loud - italian tv 1982 - who filmed this ...? genes face is superimposed over the band, you cant even see them. only about 3 preformances of this song i know about from this era (promo video 82 and rock and rio 1983 - the preformance of this song is better on exposed)
10. cmon and love me - 76 cobo hall preformance - excelent musicianship.
11. hooligan - Peter Criss solo album!! you don't see this song anywhere else.
12. shock me - ace song unbelievable solo
13. I - whoah! there is only 2 recordings of this song live and this is one of them (1981-mexico) they are lip sincing and it is clear that this is a wacky song preformed live (common every body snap your fingers!) I love ""music from the elder"" but its clear in this preformance that they have lost their identity as a band in this preformance. sad.
14. take me - you cant even see them! it looks like it was filmed in a dark basement. why did they release this?
15. She - it says ""full kiss version"" on the box.  This is worth the price of the tape alone.  this is a crazy unbelievable preformance. peter is pretty loud but the band is tight here.
16. Black diamond - 1976 - my favorite song - a great ending to a great tape.
(there are other interviews and stuff on this but I could care less.  what is listed here are the highlights.)",1032307200,3,2400,4.326666666666667
7903434,4,B000005O2C,"WARNING: This tape is only for the extreme KISS fan. This video was cool, but the concert videos they showed were kind of strange. This tape dosn't have ""Rock and Roll All Night"" and ""Shout it Out Loud""  on it. They do have ""Black Diomand"" and ""Shock Me""  though. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons show rare pictures of the band  without makeup in the 1970's, concept ideas for the ""Destroyer""  album, and ""Saturday Night Live"" skits surronding KISS. One cool  thing is they show the KISS Mego dolls commercial. ""KISS, thats the  name... KISS, they really look insane... KISS, if rocks your game, it's  KISS! This is KISS! Each sold sepretly... by Mego"", is kind of how it  goes. Also commercials for ""Alive II"" and ""Rock and Roll  Over"". Better than most of the KISS videos. (Excluding: ""KISS  Meets the Phantom of the Park"", which is my favorite KISS movie)",956966400,2,855,4.64
7903435,5,B000005O2C,"kiss my a** is a very good and inhansing video for the little kiss fans who just joined. kiss is our leaders from the 70 80s and now 90s and  they will live forever, bruce ur a good guitar player",928972800,,195,3.875
7903436,4,B000005O2C,"Some things about Kiss I will never understand. The question here is, why put poor video in a compilation collection. The stuff from the 70's is junk in many parts of the tape. The rest is pure memorabilia heaven. It is great to see some of Kiss, Before drugs, sex addiction and alcohol killed the band. Lets hope they stay together this time.  Oh, yeah, Bruce Kulick you are a stiffy.  END",900806400,,390,4.402777777777778
