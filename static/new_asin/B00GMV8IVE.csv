6087846,5,B00GMV8IVE,"NO SPOILERS HERE.

I was worried that the more controversial elements wouldn't go over well in the U.S. so a remake would end up being gutted. I was so glad to be so wrong! Not only did Spike Lee deliver on the gut-wrenching stuff, that fans expected, but there was another level of disturbing activity of a sexual nature that even I didn't expect to see in an American movie. Very pleased about that bold step! Now nothing is off limits.

I have noticed that most of the people who didn't like the remake were already against it before they saw it. They decided to hate it as soon as they heard a remake was on the way. In the end you'll have to see it for yourself and make up your own mind. I think this version is as good as Spike Lee's other brain teaser ""Inside Man"", and I can't wait to put this new ""Oldboy"" right next to the original in my collection...",1391385600,9,862,4.186746987951807
6087847,2,B00GMV8IVE,"I saw this in the theatre and it wasn't worth the time, effort or expense.  While it is a great premise, it is poorly executed and dumbed down for the American audience.  It is also shot sloppily with a couple of action scenes that are apparent efforts to copy fights from the original Korean film...badly.  Another issue I had is the total collapse of any logic in more than a few scenes.  The bad guy seems to have knowledge of things he can't possible be aware of.  Characters take actions that go against everything the movie has been about from the beginning.  It is like going to med school, getting your degree and becoming a garbage man.  Not that theres anything wrong with being a garbage man if thats what you want but why go through all the effort and not follow through once youve succeeded.  Save your money and stream the original Korean film through one of the online services offering it.",1391126400,13,905,4.50920245398773
6087848,1,B00GMV8IVE,"After begging for money for months and finally (somehow) ending up with a bloated budget of $30,000,000 to remake a film that originally cost $3,000,000, Spike Lee just swindled a whole lot of people to produce a lazy remake that ended up being a total flop at the box office. There really isn't much more to say about Spike Lee's remake of the classic Korean film ""Oldboy,"" other than the fact that it is a pathetic attempt at a cash grab and the completely unnecessary ""Americanization"" of a modern foreign classic. This film makes light of the dark and haunting story of Oldboy and even makes some parts that should have been dark and gut-wrenching unintentionally funny. The whole film feels like a goofball attempt to remake Oldboy in terms that a western audience would enjoy, seeing as how the original Oldboy was probably too smart for most western audiences in the first place with its subtlety and a visceral, unflinching script.
As much as I enjoy watching Josh Brolin as an actor, he is barely passable in this film. Brolin barely captures Min-Sik Choi's dark performance in the original. The supporting cast, even with phenomenal actors like Sharlto Copley and Sam Jackson, this film felt lifeless, boring, and an insult to Chan-Wook Park.

Skip this garbage, watch the original, and stop giving Spike Lee money.",1390608000,183,1325,4.8628318584070795

6088001,5,B00GMV8IVE,"I can't remember where I first saw this movie but, after reading about it, I gave it a try. This is a remake of a Korean film and features Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, Sharlto Copley (starred in District 9), and Samuel L. Jackson. This is a very violent movie with a completely twisted plot. The premises is that a man who is essentially a loser is kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, then released to find out who kidnapped him and why. To offer any more of a description would spoil the surprise in all of its twists and turns. Brolin gives a great performance as the main character who goes from being a loser to a man of conviction. Elizabeth Olsen is convincing as the damaged young lady who serves as the love interest. Samuel L. Jackson has an over-the-top low level villain. The standout in this film is how well Josh Brolin fights... it just has to be seen!

Also, Sharlto Copley gives a strikingly different performance as ""the Stranger."" He is an incredibly versatile actor who creates an entirely different persona for each new character. I love him in other movies so it was great to see him as the mysterious villain.

Overall, if you enjoy a good, fast paced revenge film then you may like Oldboy. The twists and turns, numerous stabbings, and a wicked turn at the end makes this a film I keep watching over and over again!",1490313600,,1342,4.495901639344262

The film is about a drunk (while much time is spent on this, I don't think it is relevant). He is captured by someone or some group and imprisoned in a room for twenty years. Then he is able to escape, and some things happen. For it turns out that the captors wanted him to escape after twenty years.

6088198,3,B00GMV8IVE,"I have to come into this as open and honest as I can, because on the whole, 2013's ""Oldboy"" has gotten an almost universally unfair reception from audiences.  And this is because it is without question an unnecessary remake of the original 2003 Korean masterpiece.  The original film that I highly admire and consider to be my absolute favorite film of all time.

And as a result...  this film had been anticipated and met with almost immediate dismissal and hatred from fans of the original.  Many of whom I guarantee haven't given it a fair chance to stand on its own due to their overwhelming adoration of that original film.

I was never as dismissive of this remake as many others because frankly, the original film is such a spellbinding masterpiece (again, my favorite film of all time), there's no way this film could tarnish its excellent reputation.  So I merely wished for the best, and hoped it would stand on its own as a decent-enough retelling.

Then came the stories of the behind-the-scene scuffles between director Spike Lee and the studio.  Most notably over the fact that about 40 minutes of the film was forcibly edited-out without Lee's consent or approval.  Which no doubt had a negative impact on the film and its pacing.

So in the end... was 2013's ""Oldboy"" the trainwreck fans were making it out to be since the instant it was announced?  Was it really destined to be one of the worst remakes of all time?

No.  Not at all.  Sure, it's vastly inferior.  But not at all the terrible slight against art and society that the original film's more vocal fans have built it up to be.  It's merely an ""Ok movie.""  Nothing more.  And certainly nothing less.

I'd rather not get too involved in the intricacies of the plot and story, as they are generally quite close to the original and I could venture to guess that most people reading this review are at least somewhat familiar with the story.  But its general set-up is fascinating:  Boozy advertising-exec Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) is kidnapped and placed into a twisted, hotel-like prison for twenty years...  held against his will.  After fundamentally changing as a person, he is suddenly released one day with the ultimatum of trying to discover who locked him up and why...  And he will suffer the consequences if he fails to unravel this treacherous mystery...

The stand-out aspects of the film are definitely Brolin's performance and the excellent imprisonment sequence that makes up much of the first act of the film.  As outstanding as the original is, I do think Brolin is the perfect choice for an Americanized version of the lead character and he does give one hell of a performance as a man whose life is changed repeatedly due to the extraordinary circumstances he faces.  And I do think that despite a few shaky moments, the first twenty minutes of the movie in which the character of Joe is imprisoned is almost as good as the accompanying sequence in master-director Park Chan-Wook's original.  Lots of great moody visuals and atmospheric tones that hammer home the depravity and desperation of the situation.  And definitely ""Americanized"" in just the right way...  being more of a moody and gritty analysis of the going's-on in contrast with the original Korean film's more operatic and borderline-psychadelic-at-times visual style.  (I also enjoyed how both films used animal life to accent the situation- the American version having a very touching few moments as Joe connects with a mouse he discovers to serve as a sort-of creative-accent-and-contrast to the original film's use of ant-based imagery.)

The film also benefits from a good performance courtesy of Elizabeth Olsen and for serving up a relatively competent re-creation of many key sequences found in the original, all while delivering it with a new directorial approach.

Where the film falls flat, though, are two major aspects.  The first being the aforementioned studio-enforced cuts.  Dear lord, you can tell that this film was butchered by the studio.  The first half-hour is promising, giving hints that at very least this will be a good (if not still somewhat inferior) remake of the original, but the second and third acts suffer greatly because the pacing is so out-of-whack and key plot and character development points feel like they've been treacherously abbreviated.  You can just feel it, and on my first viewing, I did find myself pointing to the screen on at least three occasions going ""Ok, they obviously just cut out a scene here because it moved way too quickly and felt unnatural"" or ""Here they obviously removed an important character-beat because they characters have gone through a somewhat abrupt change that clearly is the result of a missing scene.""  It's a tragedy, because it takes what could have been a good (not great, but good) film and condenses it down to a merely ""halfway decent, generally ok"" film.

And the other big failing is the villain portrayed by Sharlto Copley.  Copley is generally a fun, charasmatic actor, and I was excited to see how he would perform as the surrogate of the original movie's complex antagonist Lee Woo-Jin.  Sadly, though, Copley's ""Adrian Doyle Pryce"" falls far short, becoming far too much of a stock mustache-twirler with his nonstop scenery-chewing.  I think this is the one thing major failing I can attribute to director Lee and the new screenwriter...  You can tell that they felt they had to out-do the expectations of hesitant fans, and so they put their all into making Adrian an extreme villainous presence.  But they went too far, and he comes off as more of a Roger-Moore-era-Bond-Villain than a serious threat.

But that being said, he's really the only sore thumb amongst the cast.  So despite being a big issue, I can't say he actively drags the entire film down or anything.

When it comes down to it, there's no way this film was ever going to exceed the original.  We needed to accept the film for what it was going to be, faults and all.  And as a stand-alone film, it's definitely watchable.  Even enjoyable at times thanks to Brolin and Olsen's great performances and a handful of scenes that are well-executed.  Just not overtly good because of those faults it has.

I'd honestly venture to say that if we were able to see Spike Lee's original cut of the film with those mythical 40 minutes of missing footage, the film would be a lot better for it.  Because you can tell the main issue is the fact that so much footage is missing.  Even during the editing process, people who saw early work-prints of the film with those missing scenes spoke much more highly of the film than they did of the final product.  So I definitely do hope that we will one day get the chance to see Lee's original vision.  I think it will be a much better and more honorable remake than the butchered-yet-occasionally-enjoyable version we have now.

(It's almost akin to the way that Clive Barker's ""Nightbreed"" was butchered by the studio after they got cold-feet regarding its content.  Hey, if ""Nightbreed"" can get a Director's Cut 20 years later, maybe we can get the same for Spike Lee's ""Oldboy""?)

All-in-all, I know I won't be able to change the mind of the fans who have already committed to their negative opinions... But I hope that the open minded fans and audiences will at least give this film a fair shot.  The original film is my favorite movie of all time, and even I thought there was a bit to like here.  So hopefully more people will see its value in the future...",1451088000,,7511,4.779674166020171

6088238,4,B00GMV8IVE,"Ive seen this film get ripped apart by so many people that I had to also give my opinion. First, yes ive seen & own the original Korean Oldboy film. That said, I found this to also be a very enjoyable movie. Josh Brolin did a great job in here, the action scenes were well done, the general story & tone of the original were kept while obviously changing somethings but that doesn't make it a bad film. Whenever I see remakes I try NOT to compare them to the original & just take them for what they are. I also think people hate the idea of remakes in general because even when a remake is a shot for shot copy of the original (Psycho 1999) it STILL gets hated on for not changing anything but if they change things, people will also hate on it. Its a no win situation. So with that mindset I sat to watch this version of Oldboy & found it brutal & entertaining. If I wanted to  watch the original I would have. Don't skip out on this film cause of the bad reviews or you might miss something you may enjoy, I for one & am glad I took the chance on watching it.

I just hope one day Spike Lee's original 140 min cut of this film comes out as from what I gather both Lee & Brolin were more pleased with that version of the film. Don't go into this comparing it to the original & you might be surprise by it.",1444780800,2,1306,4.0

6088330,4,B00GMV8IVE,"I will lay it all out for you first. And this will be a long winded review. This is not a remake. The 2003 Korean film by Park Chan-wook is not the original source material. So, I hate that this film is in constant criticism of not being the 2003 Korean film. Because it's not a remake of that film nor was ever meant to be a remake.

The original story of Old Boy is a Japanese manga (comic) that the 2003 Korean film was adapted from. And not even 50% accurate at that. With that being said, the 2003 Korean film ""Oldboy"" is a great film in it's own right, but the 2013 American film ""Oldboy"" is a different adaptation that falls somewhere between the Japanese manga and the 2003 Korean film.

I personally really appreciate Spike Lee's adaptation of this film. While he did take quite a few liberties with the material, he took less liberties than Park Chan-wook did with the 2003 adaptation. Both films are absolutely amazing and a must see. The Japanese manga is an even more-so must see if you enjoyed the films. I personally love all three works of art and find them to be masterpieces in their own rights.

But, one thing you'll find on reviews of these two films that I severely loath is calling the 2013 film a remake of the 2003 film and that the 2003 film is the ""original"". Neither of these claims are remotely accurate. As the Japanese manga is the original and these two are merely adaptations of it. And the 2013 film get many poor reviews for the differences from the 2003 film even though the 2003 film is even more-so different from the Japanese manga. And it's quite a shame. As both films are magnificent.

The 2003 film has so many things that were absolutely amazing about it, the original score, the over the top feel of the entire film, and most importantly the acting of Choi Min-sik in the leading role. However, it is not without it's faults. The supporting cast is nowhere as great as Min-sik and the film really shows it's weakness there. The worst of this is by the leading female role played by Kang Hye-jung as she shows no death to the character and at times is downright annoying. The film doesn't do much to hide the big twist.

As for this 2013 film, the leading role played by Josh Brolin seems to be much closer to it's counterpart leading character in the Japanese manga. And as for the leading female role played by Elizabeth Olsen, the character is much more likable and Olsen's acting really shines in this role and her character is a stronger role and much more prominent in this film as is the counterpart in the Japanese manga. While the 2013 film pays a few homages to the 2003 film, it holds a closer feel of the Japanese manga and I personally find it a great balance between the two materials.

And at the end of all this, I recommend each of these three materials to everyone. Now as I said, this was a long review, but I believe it had to be this long to clear up a lot of misconceptions of this 2013 film. And it really stands well on it's own. And it definitely deserves better than what it gets from those who want to believe the 2003 adaptation is the ""original"" masterpiece that should be left untouched.

So, to all whom decide to give this movie a shot, enjoy it. Because it really is a gem that gets under appreciated.",1433635200,23,3278,4.372742200328407

6088566,1,B00GMV8IVE,"Pure garbage. Considering the brilliance of the original film, the idea of even remaking this is insulting. Let alone it being done by Spike Lee. Sure Lee has his style and a reputation as a film maker, but this is not his bag to say the least. Even with the name cast of actors and inflated budget he wasn't able to create something watchable. Sure, I am biased because I believe that the original is one of the best films ever made and I've listened to critics claim that if viewed alone, without comparison to the original, that this film is a worthy production. I call BS on both accounts. Film doesn't live in a vacuum and neither should the comparison of the original and the remake. Second, this movie just blows hard. Finito.

I know you might say, but we don't want to watch a foreign film with subtitles. Dam, I even watched the overdub with some friends that weren't in to subtitles and they were still really impressed with the original. Just do yourself a favor and pretend like this crap was never made, use its publicity as an opportunity to turn people to the original and watch ""Oldboy"" by Park Chan Wook and not Spike Lee.",1409270400,4,1140,4.454545454545454
6088567,4,B00GMV8IVE,"Ever since the success of the Grudge, 10 years ago, American filmmakers have been looking to popular overseas films for original ideas, many times simply remaking them. To many, this seems like a desperation move for original material, but I see it more as a cultural thing. Movies often reflect the society of the country they were made in, and by remaking them in the United States, the story introduces movie lovers to something unique, from a different culture. I personally find this very desirable and have appreciated many of these remakes, even when I didn't love the story. In his latest venture, Spike Lee takes on the Korean classic, Oldboy. This is a film that was remade simply because of how bizarre and shocking the story is. The year is 1993, and Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) isn't a great guy. For some reason, he's drugged and then locked away in a pretty decent looking room without doors or windows, and held there for exactly 20 years. Then, just as suddenly as he was imprisoned, he was released, and goes on a search for answers, in this seemingly new world. Josh Brolin stars and is usually pretty good as an ancillary character, but as the star of a thriller, I was skeptical. As always, he could have shown some more emotion, but he was much better than I thought he'd be. Spike Lee gives him as much help as he can, by giving him a huge cast of supporting actors, all of whom had name recognition. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson playing a psychopath, was very funny, and definitely injected some much needed humor. Oldboy is one of those films where it all comes down to the ending. If you're unfamiliar with the story, I won't say anything other than to tell you, that it is bizarre and twisted, with an ending the likes of which you couldn't possibly have imagined. Even if you start to watch this film and don't really like it, stick with it, because the ending really is that good.",1408838400,2,1911,4.558139534883721

6088600,1,B00GMV8IVE,"Watch an Apple commercial, a SyFy Channel original, and drink some Drain-O to reach the same effect.

Spike Lee is a hack who cannot make a movie that is not about racism.  The film is hokey in addition to being one GIANT commercial for all things Apple.  It is riddled with over the top product placement at crucial turning points of the story.  You will find awful lines like: ""Here... Just use Apple Maps"" or ""We can use Shazam to figure that out.""

The villain is absolutely ridiculous and utterly unbelievable.  Not sure where they found this guy, but if I had to guess, I would say that he was probably found in the rejected pile from an early 90's porn.  He seems as un-natural and awkward as Paris Hilton playing Mother Theresa.

The fight scenes are almost comical.  You can clearly see punches being pulled or just not connecting at all.  However, the worst thing about the fight scenes is the fact that Brolin is repeatedly hit with an assortment of blunt weapons which illicit no reaction (no even a flinch).

The original is a work of art.  The remake (which I was extremely excited for) is a regurgitated piece of dog s*** that makes no sense.  If I were Spike Lee I would be ashamed to release this 30 million dollar piece of s***.  It was as if he said, ""Hey, lets take an awesome idea and awesome characters and see if we can make 104 minutes of nonsensical dribble while simultaneously wasting a s*** ton of money and talent.""

There were lots of scenes in this movie that didn't even make too much sense, or almost had a pseudo-comic feel to it. The soundtrack was not in the least bit intriguing.

It did not resonate with me but I can understand it attaining cult status because there is so much to capture our imagination. I have watched many imitations and some movies have blindly adapted many of the scenes from the original. Such was its influence.
Spike's Lee's version fails to register, surpass or add any value to the original which is sad because he is such a great director. I guess one should not mess with a classic.
If you are not familiar with the story, here is a brief synopsis: Josh Brolin is Joe Doucett, a hard drinking wreck who finds himself in a room that is a private prison and is held hostage for 20 years without any knowledge of his captor's identity. Just as he was captured abruptly, he is let out one day. He then attempts to exact revenge on his captors but his captors have a mind of their own.
Lee's Old Boy is faithful to the original but he has toned the violence down significantly. The scenes from the original movie where a man severs his own tongue and the octopus gorging have disappeared. However the single take shot in which Brolin takes down a few dozen thugs is still intact.
The look of the film is tension filled and Lee does a good job creating the tension and then shocking us with the final revelation.
I will always wonder why would have Lee chosen to direct the project when he had nothing new to offer.  As the movie's main message reminds us  about being responsible for our own choices, can these words also apply to Lee.",1406419200,,1607,4.3533333333333335

6088678,3,B00GMV8IVE,"WARNING: This review contains spoilers of both the original and this remake.

When looking at a remake I feel it is best to judge it, to an extent, not based on personal tastes, but how it compares to the original. Is it on par or even better than the original? Does it bastardize the original story and characters? And was a remake even necessary?

Is it on par or better than the original? Definitely not! While I do not feel that this is a horrible movie (despite me wanting to pick it apart), it's far from the emotionally gripping movie that was the Korean classic.

Does it bastardize the original story and characters? Somewhat, yes it does. While I do feel that the movie does the beginning quite well, and even sometimes better than the original, it ends up divulging into blandness after Mr. Doucett leaves captivity.
The reason I think the beginning of this version is somewhat better is because Joe Doucett is shown as the loud-mouth alcoholic, and is then transformed into someone with discipline and drive by the end of his captivity. While in the original Oh Dae-su is shown briefly before his kidnapping and his problems are only hinted at briefly. This could be because the makers wanted to have it more subtle (which the remake is definitely not), but in the end it does not make much of an impact on you when you see him transform into a more calm brooding man.
Now as for the main players of the story:

Oh Dae-su vs. Joe Doucett- While I did mention that Joe was a better character before and during his captivity, it does end there. After he is released he becomes quite the psychopath and it's hard to feel sorry for him. While, of course, Oh Dae-su was violent and took down anyone in his way, he didn't go around assaulting people, needlessly killing people, and beating people who just piss him off, like Joe. You just feel infinitely more for Oh Dae-su and his goal, while Joe feels like some action hero put in a bad situation.

Mi-do vs. Mia- It's almost the same as the difference between Oh Dae-su/Joe. In the beginning of the film Mia was the better character, but then was pushed back into just being the love interest. Mi-do was never anything too special of a character, but at least she was consistent and had a distinguishable personality at the end. Mia, in the beginning, was someone who had depth to her. She was someone who has had her own troubles in the past, yet rose above them to help other people by working in the medical field. Not only this, but the relationship between her and Joe actually developed (unlike Oh Dae-su and Mi-do, even though they had a good reason as to why this was), but then that is all thrown away and she just follows Joe around as a one-dimensional character. Pretty disappointing.

Lee Woo-jin vs. Adrian Pryce- This was probably my biggest disappoint when it came to characters. While I did not agree with Lee Woo-jin actions, you did have to feel for the guy and all the pain he suffered for the love he lost (no matter how much it sickened you), and his psychotic way are a reflection of everything he has felt. On the flip side, Adrian Pryce just seemed like self-entitled rich kid who wanted revenge on anyone who had any little part to play with his families' demise. Then again, he might have been a better character if he had more than 2-3 scenes, you know, where you could actually see his depth. If that was not bad, you could not even start to feel sorry for him. With Lee Woo-jin's past, you could tell that he actually had a deep love for his sister. With Pryce, it just seemed like he enjoyed being part of an incestuous family. Honestly, his father had more to do with it and would have made a better character. By the end of the movie, Pryce just seemed like some low-level Bond villain.

I will not really go into how to plot differs from the original movie (other than the hints of it that were in the character descriptions), but it is definitely not a shot-for-shot remake like I have heard many say. Outside of a few minor details, the changes more so hindered the movie than help it find its own ground.

Now, for the last question: was the remake even necessary? No, no, and NO! The only time a remake is ever necessary is if the original movie is horrible dated* or just plain horrible. The original is neither. Oldboy (2003) was not even 10 years old when the production of this film started and there was nothing that needed to be fixed or changed about that version. This American remake is completely unnecessary and, for the most part, unwanted.
*keep in mind that a movie can be old, yet not feel dated at all.
In conclusion, I gave this three stars because it was not horrible. Honestly, if the original did not exist I would probably like this a tad bit more. It just did not do anything special or good to distinguish itself enough from the original. I would only recommend this to REALLY curious fans of the original or those who cannot stand to read subtitles to foreign films.

RANT TIME: The best way to describe the overall feeling between the versions is to point out a reworked scene (and my personal favorite). After Joe finds the place of his captivity, he makes his way in and finds the information he needs. But a huge gang of henchmen show up and try to block his escape, resulting in an all-out brawl. The reason I loved the fight scene in the original is because it was so realistic and gritty feeling. Every hit a person took was both down-played yet destructive. Not only that, but the gang of henchmen, even without dialogue, seemed to have personalities. Some would cower in few while some would try to brave the wrath of Oh Dae-su. Every person in that scene was very human feeling. Plus, you got to love that it was an impressive continuation shot--no cuts at all. The remake on the other hand felt like a generic action movie fight scene where punches are a dime-a-dozen and almost nothing has a huge impact. It was bad enough that you could tell some of the henchmen in the background were just swinging their weapons around for no reason and purposefully missed when they actually did try to strike.

6088710,3,B00GMV8IVE,"Remaking a cult classic is not an easy task, especially when the originals story has its roots in a different culture. Spike Lees Oldboy (2013) is a remake of a Korean cult classic of the same title (2003) directed by Park Chan-wook, which is inspired by a Japanese comic Old Boy by Garon Tsuchiya and Nobuaki Minegishi. (Interestingly, the comic has a different storyline.) So, how can you transplant this story of a vengeful man into a different culture?

Director Spike Lee and writer Mark Protosevich took the safest course: changing a bit, but not really much. Josh Brolin is Joe Doucett, an alcoholic advertising executive, who, after being confined in a room for twenty years, is freed. Joe sets out to find out who is responsible for his imprisonment, with a help from a nurse named Marie (Elizabeth Olsen).

While the remake manages to entertain (and shock) in its own way, it lacks the emotional intensity that this kind of story should have. In short, despite the effectively tense performance from Brolin, we really don't care much about his journey into darkness. Characters say what they say, but their words (especially those of Sharlto Copley as The Stranger) do not capture their emotion. The film explains their motives, but not to any depth.

Perhaps only in Eastern culture the story of Oldboy is possible. Actors are doing their best trying to do the famous hammer fight sequence, one of the highlights of the original, but somehow it looks too slick and clean (and why don't they just shoot the guy in the first place?).

Reportedly there is a longer version of the film, so maybe we should wait for that, though we are not sure if it will be available. As to the present version of Oldboy it only proves once again that some films don't need to be remade.",1404518400,,1778,4.707395498392283

6088715,3,B00GMV8IVE,"I recently revisited the original version of this film and it held up well. It's a good concept, well realized. Spike Lee must have gone brain dead during the remake because this shows none of what has made him such an insightful director over the years.

Here's the scoop. Josh Brolin plays an advertising exec who is self absorbed, a cad, a poor father with a divorced wife. He drinks to excess and is generally a screw-up. He gets kidnapped and is held prisoner for 20 years then inexplicably released with a new suit and a pocketful of money. He sets out to find his captor and exact revenge.

This starts out really well. You get a good sense of Brolin's character. He IS a bad guy who gets really scary when he gets drunk. Like a bomb that might or might not go off. Then there's the incarceration. Again Brolin does a good job. His gradual realization of the fact he cannot escape and how he deals with it are as smooth as silk. Then, when he's released those next few scenes are still Okay. But from there it goes downhill fast and steep. I put the stink factor on the script. Spike knows where to put the camera and get things moving within the frame. But too many things, like Brolin's escalating relationship with Marie (Elizabeth Olsen) just doesn't work. You don't feel it, so, when the big punchline comes, it borders on ridiculous. hen there's the back story which IS the reason for the whole film. This is rushed, so it too has nowhere near the impact needed to warrant what is happening.

Brolin's performance is good given what he ad to work with. Olsen is good enough but her part is underwritten. Copley never found the right notes for his character and Sam Jackson muscles his way through a comic book role.

It turns out Spike Lee's original cut was about an hour longer.  He and Josh Brolin were much happier with that version, but producers cut the film down to what we see here.  Since this movie did so badly at the box office it's doubtful that we'll see Spike Lee's original version, but I hope someday we can.

I don't think it's entirely fair to blame how this turned out on Spike Lee, as it was whittled down against his wishes.  He even took ""A Spike Lee Joint"" off the credits and replaced it with the less familiar ""A Spike Lee Film"".",1403740800,4,811,4.220779220779221

It bombs at this miserably at every corner creatively, and to make matters worse, I've seen better acting from bad-budget b-list actors.

10mn in and I knew I didn't want to watch this flick. I stuck with it because the premise sounded interesting and my fiancee (who was watching it with me) urged me to keep on with it for just that reason. But after another 10mn we both looked at one another and were flabbergasted at it's ridiculousness. There was no feasible way we were going to lose anymore time in our life to this flick.

They did their best to recreate the most iconic scenes from the film that has become a cult classic, but they left the story hanging out to dry in the process.",1400630400,,404,4.328947368421052
6088784,3,B00GMV8IVE,"Hollywood has been threatening to remake Oldboy for some time now.  At one point Stephen Spielberg and Will Smith were supposed to team up and tackle the Korean revenge drama, which suggested to many that any American remake of Oldboy would be a watered down remake of Oldboy.  But I don't think anyone suspected that Spike Lee would be tapped to helm the American version of the cult classic.  Like others, I love Lees work because he is such an idiosyncratic auteur, capable of plastering all of his thoughts, concerns and fears across a movie screen.  The idea of Lee working on what is essentially a genre exercise seemed counterintuitive, but it was also the incongruous meeting of director and film that made me interested in an American version of Oldboy a decade after the release of the original.  If nothing else, Lees Oldboy shows people that he can deliver the goods when it comes to blood, guts and action.  If he didn't have so much to say, Lee could have been a damn good director for hire.

Of course, I was never a huge fan of the original film, and I think Chan-wook Park has made better movies, but over the years Ive come to appreciate the movie as a collection of bizarre and engaging images.  For me, the original never coheres as a whole, but it is a great series of disconnected segments.  Lees remake stays relatively true to the broad outlines of the originals plot.  And while in interviews Lee is quick to stress that he thinks of the film as a reimagining rather than a remake, his film is a lot more faithful than that word suggests.  If nothing else, the 2013 version of Oldboy is an interesting genre exercise that is likely to be just as shocking as the original to the uninitiated but probably only an odd curiosity for those of us who caught the first film ten years ago.

For those who haven't seen Parks film, the protagonist of Oldboy, in this version named Joe Doucett, is an overworked businessman.  Early in the film we see Joe not so clandestinely take a few chugs of vodka out of one of those flask sized containers, made for those who are committed to being day drunk on a semi-regular basis but don't want to go all the way and buy an actual flask.  Later Joe blows up at his ex-wife after she suggests that he show up for his daughters third birthday, and then proceeds to clown his own business dinner by hitting on a prospective clients date.  Lees version paints a far more desperate and depraved image of its protagonist as a member of the corporate good ol boys club.  While some might take issue with this change, complaining that Joes eventual entrapment seems more justified in the remake, it does add another layer to Joes determination to get revenge.  Tracking down those who imprisoned him seems as much about making amends for who he was as it is about plain old vengeance.

After a major bender that finds him yelling in the middle of the street and vomiting on the sidewalk, Joe wakes up in an unsettling hotel room with little more than a television, creepy photo of a bellboy, and an adjacent bathroom.  Joes captors provide him daily meals every day, including a small container of vodka and the ever present dumplings from the original film.  Here Joe spends the next twenty years of his life, barely holding on to his insanity.  Lee actually extends this portion of the film, and he arguably improves on the original by including little details like Joes attempt to befriend a mouse and her brood.  Like much of the film, the sequence is born on the shoulders of Josh Brolins surprisingly engaging performance, which spans the gamut from confusion to rage to debased desperation.

Joe does eventually get out, but instead of following through on an escape plan he has conjured, he is unceremoniously released.  From here, Joe starts to plot his revenge with the aid of an old friend played by Michael Imperioli (a Spike Lee regular) and a young medical assistant played by Elizabeth Olsen.  The remake follows the guideline of the original, and if anything it actually spends more time wallowing in the Grand Guignol twists this time around, perhaps as a rejoinder to those who believed an American remake wouldnt have the guts to follow through with some of the more revolting aspects of the first movie.  Lee evinces a clear love of Parks film, and there are a handful of visual allusions throughout the film, which seem to pierce the thin membrane separating the original and the remake.

As always, Lee brings his consummate visual eye to the proceedings, and he often garnishes his dark and seedy cityscapes with bright flashes of color.  He even films the action with aplomb, besting other directors who supposedly direct action movies as a career.  (Rumor has it that Lee filmed an even longer version of the single shot hammer sequence, but that the studio forced him to cut it down, perhaps the only real concession to American audiences in the film).  And as I mentioned, Brolins varied performance carries the film along with the same magnetic pull as one of Lees double dolly shots.  In all the film is well made.  Im just not completely certain its a necessary film.  The 2013 Oldboy is like a good cover of a song that stays pretty close to the original.  The new band knows what made the song great in the first place, and they dutifully reproduce that.  But in the end those who love the original will always prefer listening to the original.",1400371200,,5424,4.6263048016701465
6088785,1,B00GMV8IVE,"Spike Lee and James Brolin together are bound to provide some great entertainment, right?  And for the most part, they do.  This story has a well constructed character, unlikable, yet compelling.  We watched with rapt attention as the story unfolded, wondering how things could possibly be explained, as our ""hero"" became more deeply embroiled in mysterious acts of violence and intrigue.
  However, without giving away the ending, let's just say there are taboos which exist, but I would not choose to exploit those taboos in the name of entertaining the movie-buying public. To say that Hollywood has sold out, gone astray, etc. is already a cliche, so we should not be surprised at what they will do to shock the increasingly jaded viewer.

6088988,2,B00GMV8IVE,"Oldboy tells the story of Joe (Brolin) who sets out to find out why he was kidnapped and locked into solitary confinement for 20 years.

Its not that Oldboy is a terrible movie but a remake that just isn't done as well as the original.  The story here is a bit muddled and at times falls into a ""kill bill-esque"" feel with its fight sequences that seem almost silly.  The first half of the movie where he is stuck inside the room is slow and lacking much character development or any type of exploration into madness like one would expect from someone stuck 20 years.  Brolin is ok as Joe and Samuel Jackson does well as the eccentric type characters that he plays frequently but Jackson's character almost seems out of place here.

The movie was watchable but I just felt that it was missing something that original seemed to have.  Sometimes you just don't remake a movie that is done well the first time and it is especially a mistake to make one that is only a few years after the original.  If you are a fan of the original you most likely won't like this remake.

The storyline of someone getting revenge on another person for their stupid behavior many years later had potential but was poorly ""executed"". It might have been more interesting to pursue a plot in which people were imprisoned to change whatever ""bad"" behaviors they had and release them to balance out all the bad deeds they had accumulated with some acts of courage, kindness, etc.
The script and directing were disjointed as the movie jumped about with little flow to the story. The acting was overly exaggerated and contrived e.g. an out of shape businessman spending 20 years in a single room and coming out a martial arts killing machine was just not believable.",1396915200,,729,4.983606557377049

Great movie. Disgusting, creepy, and it'll give you nightmare's if you watch it before bed, that's for sure, BUT it was so well executed and the story told so well that I still thought it was a great movie. The only thing is that it shifted tone and style a couple of times so drastically that I felt like I had whiplash. The one fight scene, though amazing, felt more like a Tarantino movie than the brooding suspense film they had built for the rest of the film. One BIG point in this movie's favor is that THIS director knew how to make us feel like years were passing and make us feel the effect of those years, unlike many other recent releases. And Brolin?

6089132,2,B00GMV8IVE,"The remake is well-made and features fine performances from Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, and Sharlto Copley (as the billionaire villain); but it lacks the fearlessness and emotional wallop that made the Korean version a modern classic. (Whatever can be said of Lee's re-imagining, though, it's worth thanking the heavens that the project fell out of Steven Spielberg's hands.) Even if you eschew the inevitable comparisons to the original, it still feels like something is missing from Lee's renditionas if something was torn from the film, keeping filmmakers from realizing its potential as a darkly operatic masterpiece.

Turns out, there was something missing: roughly an hour and 20 minutes! In an interview with the New York Times, Lee discusses how studio demands and interference led to the downsizing of a key scene and the original three-hour version as a whole (the run time of the Korean original is two hours).

At first you can accept that its got some disturbing stuff taking place, possibly thinking the wrong's will be righted, not the case. This is a movie that in the end leaves you fully disgusted. Most movies that make you feel an emotion in the end, means that the actors, directors and writers all did their job. This emotion that it leaves you with, is not like that at all.

6089194,3,B00GMV8IVE,"Spike Lee's OLDBOY is the remake (really, one of many) that never should have been made. It does add some more character development for the main character (here renamed Joe Doucette), but the movie essentially unfolds the exact same way as the original. Granted, you have Samuel L. Jackson as a colorful personality who runs a rather sadistic business, but it's almost like he's in a different movie and his part of the story doesn't really add anything fresh to the proceedings. If anything, it's a bunch of unnecessary explanation for events that occurred in the original. Still, once Joe gets out of his room the movie is a somewhat interesting mystery, even if the questions are still the same. Sharlto Copley does a serviceable job as a villain with more than a few idiosyncrasies, personality quirks and secrets, but the denouement to the story is botched largely due to him. If the movie was passable up until the third act, the ending undoes any goodwill there might have been. Instead of the sheer nihilism of the Chan-Wook Park's original, Spike Lee decided to go for something more bittersweet and, quite frankly, sappy. Fans of the original won't like it, and I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone not familiar with the original who will like this either.

While at times it did feel a bit rushed and I was never as emotionally involved in the story as I wished I was, I still found Spike Lee's remake to be a highly entertaining film. It plays out like a really straight forward (perhaps a little too straight) revenge thriller/mystery with that benefits from a strong performance from Josh Brolin and plenty of brutal over-the-top violence. The greatest thing about it though has to be the twist which is one of the most disturbing, twisted, and sickening things I've ever seen in a film.

This isn't a great film and I have no doubt that the original is superior (I wouldn't be surprised if I would be more critical of the film If I had seen the original), but this is still a solid remake that's highly entertaining and worth checking out. It isn't anywhere as bad as many of the reviews on here suggest it is.

6089239,1,B00GMV8IVE,"Horrible!!!

GARBAGE!!!

What got me to watch was the question of why anyone would get locked away like that in some room and Samuel L Jackson was in it and he plays gritty interesting Characters.

Its not that the acting or film quality is bad, they are average, it is the Plot!!!  It is so disgusting and evil and bizarre and frankly, unbelievable!!!

The point of the movie is Josh Brolin went to prep school and saw a girl having sex happily with her dad, he told the other kids.  They make fun of her.  Her family flees to Europe where the Dad then goes room to room with a Shotgun massacring his family then blowing his brains out.  But the Brother survived and grew up to be a Billionaire seeking revenge.

The Billionaire's revenge was to later frame Brolin for the Murder of his wife at the time of his abduction, then manipulate the daughters foster home settings until she becomes a Junkie or throw away child.

By the time Brolin is relsased, the real daughter  is cleaned up and working in a traveling free clinic where the villian has Brolin led too straight away.  The 2 begin unraveling the Mystery and start falling for one another.  The have sex.  The Villian has a camera in the hotel room and watches them having sex in great joy.  Brolin is having sex with his daughter unwittingly and she is having sex with him unwittingly.  This is so GROSS, and its just creepy GARBARGE!!!  THERE SHOULD BE AN INCEST WARNING LABEL ON MOVIES!!!

Then Villian kills himself after showdown with brolin and brolin pays same people who first imprisioned him to imprision him again forever with the Billionaire's diamonds, and he sends Diamonds to his daughter to start life over with without telling her he is her Dad.  The Movie is so sick and twisted, I have rarely seen something so evil and so stupid!  I never give away plots, but here I will to keep you from watching such a terrible movie!

Josh Brolin is phenomenal.  He brings this character through years of growth in a number of sad and cringe-worthy scenes.  He emerges a tougher, more dangerous, and determined (and good) man framed for disgusting crimes he did not commit.  He goes on the hunt for his captors/tormentors and things start to get violent.

THEN COME THE CLOWNS!

I kid you not.  This dark, gritty, mysterious movie with loads of potential turns into RUMBLE IN THE BRONX.  Bad guys who do not know how to dress pile out of doors with 2x4's and swords and knives and such to give our man a beatdown.  They cringe and hop and threaten him from afar like they are in a Hong Kong Kung Fu comedy.  Fight after fight of the most ridiculous choreography.  It is as if the writers were contractually bound to let a group of drunken clowns write all action sequences.

What high-tech, secretive criminal operation has foot soldiers carrying 2x4's?  And no dress code?  Absolutely stupid.

I cannot stress to you enough how bad this movie gets once he is on the hunt.  It is as if the first half of the movie was written by a serious writer and the last half by teens from the 80's.

Samuel Jackson plays a parody of an evil genius--a tired, silly character who has the power to make you roll your eyes more than once.

The movie was ended before that graphic could set in, which was too late to keep the thought from coming to mind enough to be a memory in any case.  At that point I don't care what the ending is and the only thing sadder than this movie is the fact that this lowlife is a college proffesor and has access to young minds outside of his lame role as a movie director.  I am just glad that most young people are able to see through someone with an ever shrinking stature in the film industry whose only remaining talents are to whine like a brat and sell race based hate.  Unlike other movies where the cast may have wiggle room around a poor plot I think the whole cast is culpable on this one.

So he decided to ramp up the incest theme, the violence and the gore, all in all reducing it to another sub-par thriller. On a related note, one of the best production elements in the original is a long single take fight scene.  Not content with that, in Lee's version the protagonist (Josh Brolin) beats up five hulking rugby (?) players without breaking a sweat and then takes on about 25 hoodlums at once and puts them all down.  So he has mad skills.  Then when the plot calls for it, a female bodyguard drops him with two moves. Later on two thugs manhandle him without a problem.  What the heck?

However, one thing I do not appreciate and frankly will never enjoy is being brought into someone's story via film and then pulled along into something that feels familiar only to be dropped into a fly-blown, steaming pile of buffalo vomit at the end. Food wrappers come with more warning.

Hey this is candy, but at some point it's going to burn the taste buds right out of your mouth because we put huge doses of capsaicin inside the middle. So, you know, if you don't want that. Then don't eat it.

I would have loved to have seen a warning label on this movie.

Old Boy, a movie we snaked away from South Korea and repackaged under Hollywood ""standards"" and oh by the way, unless your a deviant psychopath with incestual tendencies, you're going to be very very angry and disgusted at the end. Please enjoy?

So, here's your label. This movie is...Life Sucks, then it gets worse. Then, it gets even worse than before and when you thought it couldn't get any worse. It totally does.

Interesting.

Went into this with a fairly jaded perspective --- I'm a monster fan of the original Korean film.

Having steadied myself to dislike this remake; I was prepped to write a scathing review. This despite the fact that I'm also a fan of Josh Brolin.

Let's get it out of the way. This remake is not nearly the stunning achievement of the original - the Korean actors, the direction, the sets, the cinematography, and soundtrack were all superior in every single way to this remake. Honestly, how creative can one claim to be tracing another artist's work?

So where does it leave this movie?

Actually... not bad.

I was taken aback by how decent this flick actually is, all things considered. And believe me, there were quite a few considerations.

It must be an interesting experience for those viewers who did not screen the original, and more importantly, did not know the twist shocker which stunned audiences back in 2003.

Was the impact for the ending of the remake as powerful? As upsetting?

For me, screening the Korean original was an experience that is difficult to put into words. Certainly 'amazing' comes to mind, 'stunning' for sure, and 'perverse' without a doubt.

This Americanized effort did a decent job of conveying those emotions - but with less impact. It's sort of like sipping a cool soft drink where all the ice has melted. The flavors are there, but the intensity is not. Essentially, a diluted product. Director Spike Lee, with his usual track record, once again underdelivered - particularly in the casting department. Several of the key players, save stars Brolin and Olsen, struck me as second tier thespians. Many scenes were very thin, the acting superficial and tinny.

And Lee really needs some kind of primer on how to do large scale fight scenes. Gads, those were just awful! Fake and overly staged. Such a disappointment. <smdh>

Yet, what really annoyed was the opening sequence. How difficult is it to show the passage of time? To expose the anxiety and horror of discovering you're imprisoned for reasons you cannot explain and with no recourse to appeal. Made even more horrific since you're allowed zero interaction with another human being for *twenty years*. Apparently very difficult - as evidenced by the remake.

I will admit that there was one aspect I enjoyed - the one improvement I thought Lee accomplished over the original. The ending. It seemed somehow more appropriate. A life sentence for his crime, intentional or not, to recognize and admit that he still owed a debt that had to be paid. A nice touch.

Again, given this is an inferior remake - not bad. Saved by the solid performances of Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen.

Personal Note:

- There was indeed a stunning revelation for me, but it wasn't experienced thru the film.

Was gobsmacked to learn that Ms. Olsen is related to those two twins. Yikes.

For her own sake, both professionally and personally, she should keep her locks auburn or brunette.",1394755200,,3001,4.860510805500982
6089384,4,B00GMV8IVE,"Not too long ago a Spike Lee film was an event.  Pictures like ""Do the Right Thing"", ""Jungle Fever"", and ""Malcolm X"" stirred the national debate on the state of the African-American union in the U.S.  Other films like ""Clockers"", ""Bamboozled"", and ""Summer of Sam"" didn't achieve those lofty heights but were provocative nonetheless.  Recently Lee has been flying under the radar with his  work and he's not the cause celebre that he once was.  This remake of a cult Korean film from ten years ago is an interesting departure for Lee.  Ironically the original was championed by Quentin Tarantino, a long time verbal sparring partner of Lee's.  The basic plot of the first film is essentially retained but Lee adds new elements to differentiate the two.  I like how Lee fleshes out the title character played by Josh Brolin.  There are also new plot threads that even if you saw the initial film you will still be in suspense by the end of the film.  Speaking of Brolin he is terrific as Joe Doucett, the drunken adman imprisoned for twenty years in a motel room for a crime or offense he can't remember committing.  Here Brolin displays the requisite range to broadly play the lout and eventually evolving into a sober father bent on revenge.  Not to suggest that this film is on the same level but there are remnants of Robert Towne's script for ""Chinatown"" on display.  The squeamish should be forewarned that there is a lot of brutal violence and thematic elements that may repulse.  Those looking for a good thriller this is almost as good as it gets.  Seeing the original is not a prerequisite.  For that matter it may be a hindrance.",1394755200,,1638,4.655052264808362

6089435,2,B00GMV8IVE,"I enjoyed the original South Korean film, but this remake was a septic mess.

Start with a thoroughly unlikeable protagonist, have him confined to a single room for 20 years for no discernable reason, see him released - having been transformed into a borderline sociopath and apparently a martial arts expert, and watch him search for the all-important question of 'why?'.

It could have worked but for two noteable issues. One, you don't become an unstoppable fighting machine by exercising in front of the TV, and two, when you get to the why all you can think is 'seriously?'. The motives of the antagonist are so over the top, so unrelentingly rediculous, that it completely deflates any investment in the movie. No spoilers, but the machiavellian lengths that the antagonist went thru to punish a relatively innocuous act are completely nonsensical.

Yes, they are choreographed but they are intense and satisfying(Hey, it didn't stop us from going to see those Bruce Lee movies did it?)- that's what makes this movie exciting.  This movie is full of suspense as you find yourself just as eager as the character Josh Brolin plays in trying to get answers to why he was kidnapped for 20 years.  The closer he gets to an answer the more he brings danger to those who are trying to help him.  Lots of mystery, suspense, and action.  Oh, btw, Sam Jackson is in this movie and he brings a little of that 'Pulp Fiction' flare with his character.  And the ending.... it blew me away!

OLDBOY is an interesting mix of low-intensity noir combined with a moving, sensitive, yet still very hard-hitting ending. There are all sorts of themes here; unlike many of its sort, however, OLDBOY does not get so bogged-down in its own ideas that it interferes with the basic suspense of the film. Lots of gore, violence, and sex/nudity, but it never becomes truly tasteless. WARNING: While I don't want to give away the specifics, the big ""twist"" at the end is shocking stuff that's obviously offended a number of folks. Still, it's not presented in the gratuitous in-yr-face fashion that it might have been and makes for a truly impactful element of surprise.

On the other hand, certain plot-details don't make a whole lot of sense, and I'm not sure that they are supposed to, so in that respect, OLDBOY suffers from some lazy production and direction. Nevertheless, it has a very original overall plot with elements of solipsism and quasi-fantasy, all presented in plainly realistic, easy-to-follow fashion. The blank and fuzzy spots should not be completely ruinous if you aren't too demanding. The quality of the acting and filming is generally good if not especially great.

6089522,1,B00GMV8IVE,"WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOLIERS (but trust me, that may not be a bad thing).

First, I like my movies, regardless of genre, to have at least a modicum of plausibility.  This film's most basic premise stretches that requirement to its outer limits, then fills it in with details that completely overrun its boundaries.  Examples?  Well for starters, there's the idea that one can live in isolation for 20 years without needing either a doctor or a dentist, and that he does not appear to age even a day during that time.  Then there's the idea that he can become a superhuman fighting machine simply by watching Kung Fu movies and exercising along with TV Pilates.  When he later gets into fights with entire crowds of evil henchman (who each wait their turn to get beat up while dancing around in the background), he is able to take on ten armed guys all at once, all while having a large knife thrust deeply into his upper back, and after having been hit multiple times with baseball bats and tire irons.  Sorry, I have my limits to suspending disbelief and they don't include men around 50 defeating several crowds of armed thugs while simultaneously being able to take abuse that would drop a 400 pound gorilla.

However, the complete stupidity does not end there.  The ""hero"" manages to brutally kill a couple of dozen people, commits multiple felony assaults, and an armed robbery, yet you never see a single police officer during the entire movie.  Whatever.  But the crowning achievement of the unbelievable is how the villain manages to surveil the hero and his love interest when they shack up at a random hotel room.  Somehow, the bad guy was able to predict not only which hotel they would go to, but even which room they would use, and was able to set up a pretty elaborate monitoring system in that room - all in the space of just a couple of hours.  Pretty amazing, er, I mean, impossible.

Second, as mentioned, the entire plot of the movie is not only flawed and extremely unlikely/unrealistic, but it is also unnecessarily depraved and disgusting.  This is one of those movies where I felt dirty after having watched it.  (HERE COMES THE BIGGEST SPOILER, READ FURTHER AT YOUR OWN PERIL).  The ""hero"" is an unlikeable meat head who I could never get myself to care about, but the villain is an over the top kind of cheesy bad whom the writers felt obligated to endow with every kind of stereotypical bad trait they could possibly think of, complete with a smug, effeminate, pseudo-European accent and homosexual/incestuous/pedophilic obsessions.  And, of course, the whole movie is about the villain getting revenge against the ""hero"" for discovering and exposing his incestuous, pedophile father and ""ruining"" the beautiful thing he and his sister had with billionaire daddy.  So as an adult, he spends fortunes capturing all of his former classmates who teased him when daddy was caught having sex with his high school freshman sister, only to then turn around and frame each them for the murder of their wives and place their children with adoptive couples so he could manipulate their upbringing and trick their natural fathers into later having sex with their own daughters while he watches.  I know, great movie, right?

(BIG SPOILER!!!)  But the absolute worst part is at the end of the movie when the ""hero"" finds out that he unknowingly had sex with his own daughter. He suddenly grovels before the villain, crying and begging like a slobbering idiot to be killed.  He literally goes from super bad ass to a pathetic mess in the space of half a second.  Personally, had a I suffered from the same sick revelation, and the person who orchestrated it all was standing right in front of me (and I was even a tenth of the bad ass the ""hero"" is portrayed to be), my most violent, homicidal tendencies would immediately surface and there would be one seriously damaged and dead bad guy.  I most certainly wouldn't be grovelling at crotch level before the very person who had completely destroyed my entire life simply because he wanted me to experience the same kind of incestial love he and his sister claim to have enjoyed so much while growing up with their depraved daddy.

If you value your psyche at all, and don't want to be subjected to the kinds of above mentioned stupidity and unnecessary depravity, definitely take a pass on this one.  Believe me, as bad as the things are that I have already mentioned, I'm just scratching the surface of the many, many poor elements of this film.",1394323200,7,4510,4.719387755102041

By comparison, this film lacks the explosive edge of the lead performance by Choi Min-Sik, Korea's answer to Liam Neeson(or any number of actors who are NOT Josh Brolin). The plot machinations are more ably laid out by Park Chan-Wook, with the passage of time painstakingly played out. A sense of grueling monotony and the character's perplexed reaction, his stamina, his aging seem to come alive- Spike Lee's layout of the plot seems more shorthand, a mere sketchy montage, a rudimentary set-up that robs us of a connection with what it feels like to fall down a rabbit hole.

A shocking truth, the seed from which grew a desire to enact revenge , is different. In this film, the bad guy seems connected to the sad truth more through a third party. In the Korean film, destructive  gossip springs from a more intimate connection and his sister's death springs directly from the cruelty of her schoolmates. The difference between these two stories is the difference between a melodramatic potboiler and Greek tragedy.

Stylistically, this film does not utilize set design to any great effect. Neither the room of imprisonment nor the villain's apartment become much more than just a couple of places that ""things happen"". The Korean film gives life to both sets. The room is more than just a room. It is an enemy of sanity, an entity that traps and spies on and twists Oh Dae-su inside-out. The glossy, high-tech apartment becomes an extension of a villainous revenge, a fishbowl of life lived along a razor's edge.

Elizabeth Olsen, a future Oscar-winner, could ably have given the love story a much needed charge but an inadequate script kills any real emotion. What a waste of a superb actress.

This is a student's effort to copy, but not steal, a true original piece of cinematic achievement. All the script changes fall flat. The visuals underwhelm. Everything that made the original great is missing. Spike Lee wasted his time and ours, because there is no way to improve on this classic.

Rent the original and be mesmerized. And, for that matter, rent Elizabeth Olsen's ""Silent House"" to see what treats a remake can give us and what a great actress can summon without a ham-handed script.",1394323200,3,2310,4.8354430379746836

No mystery left here, everything is spoonfed to us. Where all the characters in the original were worthy of our sympathy, these characters start out as dispicable and unlikeable. Gone is the beauty and visual poetry replaced by clich and tedium.

That's when you realize it doesn't just fail as a remake, but also as a film in it's own right. All the characters are clich. The acting is bored and disinterested. The direction is pretty much nonexistent. Beyond that, and probably most painful of all, this movie is tedious. It is paced like a turtle on quaaludes. That makes this already painfully bad movie seem to last forever. It's like having your eyes water boarded, except that you know that waterboarding ends.

6089541,4,B00GMV8IVE,"While most critics love Spike Lee I've never been a huge fan. Sure he's done some movies that I've thought were good but too often I found his films too filled with political correctness and outrage. That's fine when you start but after so many films it becomes less a statement of honesty and more one of trying to keep your following happy. The films I have enjoyed have been his more mainstream films. This week finds one of those released on DVD though mainstream might not quite be the word I'd use to describe it.

OLDBOY was a Korean made film that took audiences by surprise and by storm when it was originally released back in 2003. It was controversial and filled with extreme violence and yet it told a fascinating story. Lee has taken that original film and made it more palatable for U.S. audiences, those who still refuse to read subtitles.

Josh Brolin is Joe Doucett, an ad exec who's seen better days. Now Joe he weighs too much, drinks too much, flirts too much and tends to forget about the family he once had. After losing an important client he goes on a binge only to wake and find himself locked in a strange room with no way out. The sparse room has a bed, nightstand, huge TV screen, a false window and a bathroom. Cries for help or to know what's going on go unanswered.

By watching the TV, Joe also learns that his wife has been raped and murdered and that his daughter has been taken in child protective services. He also finds out that the police think he's the one who did this with DNA evidence to back it up. He is supplied with plenty to eat (if he'll eat Chinese food) and an endless supply of whiskey which he takes to rapidly. The only programs on his TV screen are news, exercise programs, kung fu movies and updates on the life of his daughter now being raised by an adoptive couple.

Time moves forward and first Joe feels helpless and then tries to take his own life. But the forces that be won't allow that, knocking him out with gas and then bandaging him up. Knowing that he'll survive no matter what he does, he decides to make the best of things. He stops drinking and begins to work out since most of the TV programming is exercise shows and kung fu movies. As the years go by, Joe begins to work on a way to escape, finding some lose tiles in the shower. But before he can use this escape, he is knocked out once again.

When Joe wakes, he finds himself in a steamer trunk in the middle of a field with a cell phone and plenty of money. It is now 20 years later and he still has no clue who did this to him or why. But he sees a woman carrying an umbrella with a symbol he recognizes as one he tattooed onto his own arm.  Following her he ends up in an altercation with a group of weekend sports players that he takes out easily using the things he's learned watching the TV. He loses the girl but does find an old friend named Chucky (Michael Imperoli). With his help Joe learns how to use a computer as well as the internet.

As Joe continues to search for whoever is behind this he meets a young woman who helps with the less fortunate in the neighborhood named Marie (Elizabeth Olson). Along with his friend Chucky, they continue to try and find answers to help him. Various clues are left for Joe to help him move this direction or that and eventually he is brought face to face with the person responsible. And he still has no idea who this is or why any of this has taken place.

That might seem like a lot of information but trust me when I say that things go forward from here that make all of it not only clear as to what was going on but why. Through it Joe faces off against enormous odds in a fight sequence that isn't exactly what the original presented but close enough that fans should be pleased. Lee has also decided to keep the ending somewhat intact, something that will shock many, disgust a few and surprise only those with no contact with the original film.

This move is so well paced, so well put together that there isn't a moment when you'll consider touching the remote to fast forward. You'll want to absorb not only every ounce of information in the hopes of putting the story together but you won't want to miss any of the fine quality acting on display from every single person involved. Why Brolin isn't doing more in movies is beyond me and Olsen shows that in that family she was the one gifted with acting ability.

OLDBOY is not for the weak of heart. It offers a gritty world where bad things happen to bad people and where justice takes on the oddest form. If the end of this movie doesn't make your draw drop then you weren't paying attention. As for Spike Lee I wish he'd direct more straight forward movies like this one. He has the ability to do it right, if he'd only stick to it. Lastly I would suggest that if you're interested in something different you might want to watch the original film as well. It's well worth the time.",1394150400,3,4921,4.28740581270183
6089542,3,B00GMV8IVE,"While I am aware of the original Korean film, I have never seen it.  I was actually going to watch it first but due to circumstances this one came to me first.  Skimming over a dozen or so reviews of the movie, the general conclusion is that it doesn't hold up to the original.  Since I knew little about either film, I didn't feel prejudiced either way.

The premise is pretty interesting.  Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) is a jerk.  He's a womanizing misogynist whose wife kicks him out because of his ""wanderings"" and alcoholism.  Leaving his wife and young daughter, he finds himself waking in a hotel-like room after a drunken escapade.  The room has a TV (of sorts), a bathroom, and some books; and he is regularly given food through an opening in the locked door.  He has no way to communicate and stays in this solitary confinement for 20 years.

For reasons he doesn't understand, he is suddenly released, finding himself in a vast field.  He has some money left on him by his unknown captor and vows to find out what happened.  Director Spike Lee has a good handle on this first act.  Neither Joe nor the audience know exactly what's going on.  During his search, Joe follows an umbrella he had seen earlier upon his release.  This leads him to a medical clinic and one of the aides, Marie (Elizabeth Olsen).  She stumbles upon him later and eventually agrees to help him find out what happened to those 20 years.

As Joe gets closer to the bad guys including his jailer (Samuel L. Jackson) and his boss (Sharlto Copley) things get a bit ridiculous.  We also get a look at a lot of questions which are never answered.  Lee invokes his Korean film knowledge during this middle section as Joe has to take on countless thugs schooled in the martial arts.  Joe has learned a few tricks himself watching all that do-it-yourself training during his captivity.  Although he had no chance to try it out on a real training partner, he has no problem eviscerating any and all who try to stop him.  Silly when you think about it.

When the evil Adrian (Copley) kidnaps Joe's now grown daughter, he agrees to release her and make Joe's life whole again if he can figure out why he was imprisoned.  Marie and Joe go back in time trying to solve the puzzle, providing a not-for-the-squeamish concluding act.  The film is ultra-violent which of course is not unusual for American or Korean films.  I will admit I like the mystery solving component in the movie and the fight scenes are choreographed just fine.  I just thought too much of the film was unrealistic to a fault.  It's a movie that relies on too many coincidences in the plot to make the story work.

The Blu ray version of the film comes in 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  While I have some reservations about the film, I have none about the transfer.  It is first rate.  Most of the film is shot in low light and yet the scenes are clear and sharp.  Colors are excellent if rare.  Scenes in Chinatown feature robust reds and orange.  I found no issues with grit, blemishes or other abnormalities.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is likewise excellent.  What I recall mostly is clear and distinct dialog.  Surrounds come into play with the musical soundtrack and some street life.  Excellent throughout.  There is an English SDH track but no other subtitle options.  Extras include extended and alternate scenes, a ""making of"" segment, some previews, a couple short casting pieces and a digital copy.",1394150400,,3483,4.589285714285714

Unfortunately it comes nowhere near the intensity of the Korean version directed by Chan-Wook Park. Josh Brolin's performance OK but not great.  The martial arts /fight scenes frankly are amateurish by current standards, and I don't think it was the fault of Amazon, but the video/film quality is terrible. The credits show it being photographed on the Red digital system, however, I think they tried to give it a film look.  Well, they succeeded.

I fell in love with the original Oldboy because I love gritty, old style revenge books, films and have grown to love Park Chan-wook's movies. The character development and intimacy are so very well told through the story that it's hard not to grow to feel as these characters feel.

That being said, you should take the new Oldboy for what it's worth - a new-style remake. I absolutely loved this remake. It took the best from the original - major story plots, fight scene, classic twist at the end - and added to it the elements that make it a modern day movie. If you notice, there are even subtle hints to classic scenes from the old film (*NO SPOILER* hint-the octopus in the restaurant).

As far as the style of the film, I believe it was shot very well. The action scenes were great and the flow of the movie felt very fluid. Of course, it's very rare that ANY remake is better than the original, especially when the original is from Asia-Pacific movie culture, however, this was a fantastic film that should get more credit than it has been getting.",1394064000,7,1117,4.443902439024391

I rarely watch movies more than once, unless it strikes me in way that makes me want to explore it again. This film kept me interested from the start and held my interest to the credits.

6089609,4,B00GMV8IVE,"Don't compare Spike Lee's OLDBOY remake to the Korean original.  Don't even try, okay?  We all know there's no comparison; the original OLDBOY was like a putrid blast in the face, a sucker punch to the groin.  This is a different film; yes, an American remake of an Asian cult film.  It happens.  Move on and appreciate it for what it has to offer on its own.

Compare OLDBOY, instead, to the typical Hollywood fare, to the thrillers that promise something more and then don't really deliver (I'm looking at you, GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO remake).  Lee's film has a few punches that you don't see; it has an ending you wouldn't find in another film.  It has a protagonist, perfectly embodied by Josh Brolin, who stars as an unlikable schmuck: an alcoholic ad exec (as apparently they all are), who loses a big deal.  Then he disappears.  For twenty years, locked alone in a room, going crazy, then finding purpose: get out, see his daughter, clear himself in the murder of his wife, and get revenge.

Except suddenly, just as he's planning to escape...he's set free.  He quickly finds a social worker and an old friend willing to help him in his cause, just as things become more tangled.  This is the point where any other conventional film would crumble; Lee manages to keep things together, stay on target, and deliver a couple of decently low blows.  Through it all, Brolin remains game; he gives a truly memorable performance, plunging into depths of despair, rage, and unexpected tenderness.  Sharlto Copley, in his brief role, is delectably menacing.  Elizabeth Olsen is merely along for the ride in a thankless supporting turn.  The script is solid; it offers a nice take on the original, updating it a bit and, yes, Americanizing it.  That's where OLDBOY hits its speed bumps; at times, Lee goes out of his way to remind you that you're watching a remake, the sort of wink-and-nod thing you should leave for press interviews.

Still, don't go into this film with false expectations.  It's good.  It's not great, not like Chan-wook Park's grotesque masterpiece, but it's worth the experience.  If you've seen the original, then come in with an open mind, ready to interpret this film on its own grounds.  If you haven't seen the original...then be forewarned: this isn't your typical Hollywood thriller.  It's not a classic, and you should still give the original a shot (if you can make it through), but OLDBOY is definitely worth your time.",1393977600,3,2452,4.7559241706161135

Why they bothered to still call it Oldboy when they changed everything is beyond me. The lack of originality in the parts they changed is what will make your head spin. This movie is NOT worth your rental price. Eventually it will be free to watch, and then you may mock accordingly without any charges.",1393027200,12,442,4.5375

Subtle differences to the story change the feel of the movie somewhat, especially towards the end. I still feel that the original Oldboy made more sense, in terms of the motivations of the characters, than this new take.... But it's still very very good. Cinematography is stunning - the movie is unbelievably well shot and directed. Very much retains all the grit and function of the original, but stands as it's own movie. I was ready to be disappointed and instead was quite impressed. Eminently watchable and even re-watchable.",1392940800,4,615,4.866666666666666
6089783,3,B00GMV8IVE,"I'm not going to make this a long review of the movie. Let me start out by saying I personally do not believe this remake was a bad movie, but it pales in comparison to the original.

The original version was a work of art, using visual cues to tell a story of emotional torture and one man's descending into madness.  While this movie has the same rough storyline of the original, it feels kind of watered down.  Why do all American films insist upon spelling everything out for the lowest common denominator?

That being said, this movie is watchable and kept me entertained through out it, it just lacked the ""Wow"" factor of the Korean original. It's not ""The Ring"" bad though.",1392940800,5,680,4.504065040650406
6089784,3,B00GMV8IVE,"Joe (Josh Brolin) is an ad man and not a nice person. He is a womanizer, bully , lousy husband or ex-husband, and a lousy father to his 3 year old daughter. One night Joe wakes up imprisoned in a room. He has a TV and discovers his ex-wife was raped and killed as his DNA is all over the place. Joe was framed, but remains imprisoned by Samuel L. Jackson.
Weirdly Joe is set free and engages in a cat and mouse game of life and death. He meets Marie (Elizabeth Olsen) who aids him on his quest.

This is an oddly conceived film, reminding me of parts of superior films. The audience attempts to figure out what is happening and are given no clues. We find out when Joe finds out. The climax was anti-climatic and Joe's response was overly dramatic and out of character.

Okay quirky rental

6089787,1,B00GMV8IVE,"The Ring. The Grudge. My Sassy Girl. Shutter.

All disappointing as American remakes of Asian films. But not angering. This is not a case of a good Asian film being poorly remade in America. This is a case of a great Asian film being disrespected by its American remake.

Everything about this remake is garbage. The main character, Joe Doucett, is a jerk from the start. He doesn't care about his daughter, at all. He is a loud drunk who disrespects women, and is unapologetic about it. After a night of drinking, he falls asleep in the street and vomits on himself. When he wakes up, he is locked in a hotel room. The next half hour or so goes by quickly, and focuses on his imprisonment. What should be gaining your interest, is extremely boring.

Out of nowhere, he begins to obsess over his daughter and getting clean for her. He didn't give a crap about her when he was free, but apparently getting locked up makes you love your children. At this point, they show Joe refusing to drink the vodka he is given every day with his meal (WHY? Why did they add this?) and writing letters to his daughter. He also trains along with female aerobics trainers on TV (Again, WHY?), and punches a few things.

Throughout this whole movie, Joe is fine. He doesn't go mad, his hair just gets longer and he grows a beard. He is just a normal guy, locked in a really nice hotel room for 15 years. He doesn't seem to have any emotions of any sort, really, other than his brief relationship with a mouse who he takes care of and grows to love...(Can you say, ""WHY?"")

Eventually he gets out, and let me tell you, it doesn't get better from here. The fight scenes are so awfully choreographed, so quick, and so emotionless. Brolin is not a hopeless, confused man initially bewildered by his new skills at fighting; he is a clean cut man who has always had self confidence. You will not love him, you will not feel bad for him, and you will certainly not wish for his triumph. He doesn't show that desperation that was shown in the original - the man was without human contact for 15 years, but he walks out the same as he went in.

Elisabeth Olson's character, Marie Sebastian, contains no good qualities. She is not even as interesting as a normal girl - not charming, not mysterious, not humorous, not naive, not intelligent, nothing. She has no personality at all!

And the antagonist, Adrian Pryce (Sharlto Copley), is a joke - almost out of a crappy comic book. The first time he calls Joe to let him guess who he is, I had to laugh. The guy doesn't even attempt to hide his accent to throw him off. After they talk, Joe scrambles to write a long list of enemies. I'm assuming that none of them are upper-class Englishmen. This might seem like a small thing, but it was really quite stupid if you ask me.

I won't give anything away, although most of you reading this have probably seen both the original and the remake, and I'm sure you share similar feelings.

I could sit here all day going through this remake and listing all of the things that were terrible about it, but I'll spare you. I suggest watching this and the original back-to-back, and enjoying a few laughs and a few frowns.

Oh, and the movie is terrible on its own. Even if this wasn't a remake, it'd get 1 star. Everything else aside, the whole film is a commercial for Apple products. They didn't even try to hide it. Do yourself a favor, and take a drink every time you see an Apple product in this film. It will make for a much more pleasurable viewing experience.",1392768000,37,3529,4.398773006134969
6089788,4,B00GMV8IVE,"Well, I've seen both the Korean original and then this one.
I don't think there any shame and preferring the remake to the original because this one is about twenty minutes shorter (and I was feeling the two hour mark while watching the original) and feels lighter somehow.
Probably because they did  away with a few of the things we see in the original that aren't 100% necessary to tell this tale.
Also in the true spirit of Hollywood the plot is spelled out for you pretty well....the dots are all connected for you by the end which is good because the overall story is so freaking out there that without confirmation some might not be sure that the plot is what it is.
This happened to me after watching the original ...at the end I was like OK did I just see what I think I saw?
After watching this one  it confirmed that I understood the original even though many story details are quite different.
For example in the original the main character was imprisoned for 15 years and in this one it was changed to 20 years.
There are bigger differences then that but the main point is even if you just watch this one, I found that it was entertaining as much as the first one and more accessible to others who may not enjoy reading subtitles or watching people bite into a live octopus.
Bottom line this is more then just watchable and quite enjoyable  and it may not be the original but hey still very good and some will like this much better then the original.
So if you like WTF style mysteries then yeah you have to check out Oldboy original or remake (both solid movies).",1392768000,3,1576,4.3720136518771335

This remake film isn't entirely horrible;however, it's just not even comparable to the artistic excellence of the original film. The original South Korean film is on netflix. It is an experience, and it tells the story in a logical way that the remake waters down, muddies, and jumps over. Visually, the original is sharp and striking, the colors are vivid. The acting captures every facet of feeling, and it's fleshed out with nothing missing in between. The original doesn't leave you wanting more, you'll be taken aback, thinking about it after it's over. You'll feel full, over full. If you're a light-weight, then see the remake. If you're ready to be shocked and wrapped up in a classic film, please don't see the remake. South Korean Original all the way.",1392422400,107,911,4.993421052631579

Just a bunch of stupid (and I mean STUPID) non-gratuitous violence disguised by what is one of the most common themes in H.W. these days. Father/ son dis- functionality to the nth degree. Of course Samuel J. had to be injected just to bring the language rating to a high level of the F bomb word. You get my drift. I am getting personally disgusted (Extremely disappointed to say the least)  with this generic trash stuff being brought to the marketplace and labeled as ""Entertainment"".  Look up the definition of the word and you'll find out this ain't ""IT"" folks. Can only hope J.B.'s agent gets fired for coercing him into these B-rated roles.
