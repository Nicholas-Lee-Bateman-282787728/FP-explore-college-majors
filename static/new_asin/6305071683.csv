In all of the episodes there is a big logo stammped in the corner of the screen saying ""THE JACK BENNY COLLECTION"". In some episodes it is stamped in both corners or in some episodes the logo starts on the right side then moves over to the left side> But overall the picture and sound quality is good and I reccommend the collection.",1106524800,4,494,4.051020408163265
957953,1,6305071683,"I think Jack Benny would roll over in his grave at what was done to his fabulous work as a comedian.

Can you imagine watching Star Wars or the Lord of the Rings DVD's and not in the corner but one third of the way in from the left and a quarter of the way up the screen there was a large logo stamped on the screen saying ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" and that this was present throughout the movie?

This is what they did to Jack Benny.  You get to watch a large ""The Jack Benny Collection"" written on your screen throughout.  I have no idea why.  Is it an ad? ..for something you already bought?  Very disappointing to say the least.

The other thing to note is that this is not really a 5 disc set.  This is 10 Gigabytes of material spread over 5 discs. 2 gigs each instead of the 7gig average put on most DVD's.  It is less than 1  discs of material.

I love Jack Benny.  I find it sad what they did to him.

957954,3,6305071683,"This is probably as good a DVD collection as you're going to obtain thus far. It has the well-liked Christmas episode featuring Mel Blanc and Dennis Day. A few commercials are sprinkled througout. The original intro and outro tags are included. The quality is not great, but 24 episodes for about 20 bucks isn't bad. Maybe a major distributor will one day give Mr. Benny the respect he's due by giving the original tapes the top-drawer treatment, with digital and audio remastering.

That said, it's still as fine a DVD set thats out there to date. Enjoy! You'll be glad you did!",1104883200,19,579,4.676470588235294

I was so disappointed when the entire McGuire Sisters segment was cut - the cover said the McGuire Sisters sang, but truth is they only sang for 5 seconds.  I would love to see this show in it's entirety.",1096934400,32,304,4.716981132075472
957956,3,6305071683,"For reference, here's a breakdown of the contents of this set:
Disk 1: THE MEDICINE MAN (1930; film)
Disk 2: THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM (1/1954): w./ Liberace
  THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM (3/1954): ""Goldie, Fields, and Glide"" (Bing Crosby, George Burns, & Bob Hope guest)
Disk 3: THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM (2/1958): ""Jack at the Races""
  THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM (4/1959): w./ Ed Sullivan & ""Genevieve""
Disk 4:  THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM (12/1957): ""The Christmas Shopping Show""
  THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM (1/1961): ""New Year's Eve""
Disk 5: THE JACK BENNY HOUR (11/1959): w./ Danny Thomas, Raymond Burr, and the McGuire Sisters
As a long-time Jack Benny fan (who first discovered him during the 1980's in reruns on cable), I really found this to be a mixed set: sweets and bitters. There are some true Benny classics mixed in, especially on disk 4, which may have the funniest Benny TV program ever--""The Christmas Shopping Show.""  In this episode, Benny and Rochester try to go Christmas shopping for the gang, only to have a tangle with both Dennis Day, and, most notably, Mel Blanc, as an endlessly harrassed sales clerk. Best Mel line, said aside so Benny can hear, ""Why did the governor have to pardon me?"" The ending's rather shocking for its day--jet-black humor--but utterly hilarious. Also on DVD #4, is a very unusual late Benny program (early 1960's), in which his date with a bimbo waitress falls through, and he winds up spending New Year's with Rochester. It's actually somewhat bittersweet at moments, but it worked, and I really enjoyed watching it.
The other highlight in this set's located on DVD #3, ""Jack at the Races,"" and it's unusual in having been filmed off location (not at the CBS studios) and starring Mary Livingston and Dennis Day opposite Benny. For good measure, Sheldon Leonard (""Hey, bub!"") and Joe Besser (the least of the Three Stooges) show up and stay in excellent form. Benny heads out to the horse track for the day, where he runs afoul of his show's sponsor (whom he convinces to bet on a losing horse) and Joe Besser in a restaurant (where Sheldon Leonard offers Jack tips on the ""best tables""). Wait until you see how Joe clears Jack and Mary's table!
I wasn't as fond of the rest of the Benny shows on the other disks (although ""Goldie, Fields, and Glide"" and ""Liberace"" *definitely* have their funny moments), due to the ""variety show"" syndrome creeping in ever more steadily. To my mind, what made Benny great were his recurring character actors (Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, Phil Harris--on radio, Dennis Day, Mel Blanc, and others) and once you see Jack opposite performing chimps or in a bad ""Carol Burnett"" style courtroom skit with Ed Sullivan, the show suffers badly. All of the running jokes we love so much (""Yes?"") get tossed out the window also.  It may have helped ratings along in the late 1950's and early 1960's, but it was a bad artistic mistake in retrospect.
You will either find THE MEDICINE MAN intensely interesting or hate it and find it dull. I fell in the first camp. However, Benny as actor in the film's nothing like his later ""Jack"" character, who wouldn't really come along until the radio show hit its stride in 1936 or 1937.
In general, the DVD menus are fun, but there are no extras. The print quality's O.K. for what are obviously public domain shows. Visually, they looked better than the DVD's released by either Alpha Video or Diamond Entertainment. I'm tempted to say you should support this set, as there's very little Benny available on DVD and perhaps the contents will be a bit more generous in future releases if the sales for this set warrant future ones.  Unfortunately, MGM's sitting on the original shows hidden away in its vaults, so we can probably only expect P.D. shows for the foreseeable future. As much as I love Benny's show, I must admit that he's not as commercially bankable as he once was, as not as many people are familiar with his work now.
Good night folks, be seeing you soon.",1078185600,123,3964,4.7402031930333814
958010,1,6305071683,"The musical numbers are not included but the ads are. What a waste. Jack Benny was a genius, and it's a shame his shows can only be found on low quality, poorly done DVD's.

958012,4,6305071683,"In my childhood, the Jack Benny show was on during the afternoon.  I didn't appreciate it, and it took some maturing, an addiction to amateur theatre, and studios shovelling dross in front of us for me to realise just what gold it was that was offered us by the old vaudeville entertainers.  I was excited to find and order this collection, although I do think that 60 minutes per disc is parsimonious at least.

""Jack at the races"" is mentioned in the studio review, but is replaced by a sketch with Humphrey Bogart that is wonderful.  Seeing the old Hollywood tough guy camping it up was great fun.  Most of the ads have been cut because cigarette commercials are now banned.  Some survive, and give context to some of the jokes.

The collection is expensive for what it offers, but for the true fan, its offering is hard to ignore.",1209427200,,834,4.52
958013,1,6305071683,"This set is a complete rip off.  Each disk contains about an hour of programming.  I only saw the first disk.  That was enough for me.

The movie, The Medicine Man, was only one hour and six minutes long.  The picture and sound quality was shameful.  The movie was not much better.  It was a total disappointment.

I did not even bother watching the rest of the set.",1188000000,,366,4.279411764705882
958014,4,6305071683,"Though I agree that Madacy could have done a better job, I also agree that the quality of much of the material makes up for some of the deficits.  Some of the episodes, as one might reasonably expect, are better than others in terms of dialogue and comedy, but especially when viewed in the context of their time, they offer surprisingly snappy material with an occasional risqu reference.

Benny fluffs many a line and seems a bit vague here and there, which rather endears him to the viewer and helps to create a cosiness and sincerity which is almost entirely absent from modern comedy.  His material stands out from other comedians of his time in that the best lines are often given to his co-performers and Benny is insulted and ignored by his guests, to great comic effect.

The sprinkling of commercials which are included are somewhat jaw-dropping - very strange to see ad's promoting tobacco products and people sucking on ciggies all over the place - but strange also that these things seem rather shocking today, when current ad's (at least here in the UK) often show explicit sexual or aggressive behaviour, which rarely causes a ripple.

The extras are poor, consisting of text giving background on some of the cast, but there are parts missing or under the wrong names.

Nonetheless, as far as the shows are concerned, a good collection for the price, nicely packaged and it would be great if more shows were released.",1176163200,,1432,4.754032258064516
958015,1,6305071683,"You can find all of these episodes on discs from other distributers, so patronize them. The songs have been cut from these copies (Dennis Day, Bing Crosby, etc.).",1143244800,16,162,4.821428571428571
958016,4,6305071683,"Jack Benny was the most admired and respected comedian of the early 20th century. His graceful style of humor was a major influence on Johnny Carson and Kelsey Grammer, among others. Over the course of his 60-year career, he matured into a first-rate comic actor. He brought class and dignity to television at a time when it was needed the most. If you've missed him as much as I have, this generous collection of TV episodes will bring back many pleasant memories.

This collection spans the years 1951 to 1961, giving us the most comprehensive overview of Benny's TV career to date. The show was initially produced live before a theatre audience in the style of a stage play, and these early episodes are as fascinating to watch today as they were fifty years ago. It was during this period that some of the biggest stars in Hollywood made their TV debut on Benny's show, including Marilyn Monroe (never lovelier) and Humphrey Bogart (graciously spoofing his tough-guy image). Both shows are included here, making this collection a must-have for star-gazers.

Fans of Benny's long-running radio series will enjoy spotting the numerous cameo appearances from his radio cast, including Mel Blanc (man of a thousand cartoon voices), Mary Livingstone (who never did the live shows because of stage fright), Frank Nelson (the smiling jerk who insults Benny at every turn), and Dennis Day (the dim-witted Irish tenor). Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson, the Sportsmen Quartet and announcer Don Wilson appear in many of the episodes as well.

I was hesitant about buying this package because Madacy Video has a reputation for poor quality control (their Red Skelton box set is a ripoff, even at half the price). I didn't expect detailed information about broadcast dates or chaptered scenes within each episode, and I didn't get it. What I did get was a nicely designed fold-open case holding five discs, each one holding about two hours worth of TV shows in black-and-white. Some episodes are presented uncut with original cigarette commercials and CBS Network IDs (a bonus for TV historians) while others have gaps where the picture fades to black for ten seconds. Picture & sound quality varied from show to show, but I was able to ignore the technical faults and enjoy the performances.

I highly recommend this collection to Jack Benny fans as well as students of comedy. His subtle approach to humor along with his superb acting skills gave him an advantage that other comedians could only envy. He was an American original, often copied but never replaced. He will be missed for a long time to come.",1113696000,38,2594,4.9290617848970255

958019,1,6305071683,"I wish I had read the negative reviews more carefully before ordering this product.

Most singled-sided DVDs of TV programs contain about 4 hours of material, so I thought this 5-disc ""collection"" would contain about 20 hours of material.  Yet each disc contains barely an hour of material.

And they're not even complete programs!  No doubt in an effort to squeeze a few more dimes out of us, they didn't bother to secure the music rights, so all the musical numbers have been chopped out.

This ""collection"" is at most 2 discs worth of material. BTW, DVD#3 is supposed to contain ""Jack at the Races."" Both the box and the DVD itself are labelled as such, yet that episode is missing and in it's place is a detective sketch with Humphrey Bogart.

I bought a disc called ""The Jack Benny Show"" at the grocery store for $4.99.  It has 5 programs, 2 of which are also in this collection, and a total running time of 2.5 hours.

I give 5 Stars for Jack Benny, but 0 Stars for this ripoff collection. Don't waste your money...if you really want to see these programs,  purchase a used copy or borrow it from the library.",1106784000,72,1115,4.48019801980198

7881789,3,6305071683,"As a fan of Jack Benny, I have long sought to expand my episode collection, a deceptively complicated endeavor. Often, the same episodes will be released repeatedly on different disks. Sometimes a disk will turn up with all new material, sometimes with one or two episodes you can't get anywhere else. On other occasions, discs composed entirely of episodes you can get elsewhere for a better deal will appear. These disks frequently have no available episode guide, so telling these apart can often be hazardous. Even more confusing are customer reviews meant for one collection that have somehow ended up under another. I, the Jack Benny Trailblazer, through an extended period of careful research, mostly through purchasing the disk on a hunch and seeing what I got, am here to simplify matters.  Below are live links to each Jack Benny collection which I find most advisable to purchase found here on Amazon (although you may want an episode guide, I recommend the one on Wikipedia.org):

Best of Jack Benny (39 Episodes)
The Jack Benny Program: The Lost Episodes (18 episodes)
Jack Benny - Comedy Pack (7 episodes)
The Best of Jack Benny (8 episodes)
The Best of the Jack Benny Show, Vol. 1 and 2 (17 episodes)
Jack At the Races Ed Sullivan/Genieve Show DVD (2 episodes) (Volume 3 of The Jack Benny Collection)

The most widely ribbed Jack Benny box set, this five disk collection's reputation is not totally undeserved as it contains all of about an hour of material per disk, most of which you can get elsewhere, offered at an exorbitant price. However, found on the collection, besides the 1930 film The Medicine Man, is an episode on Volume 3 where Jack Goes to the Race Track (9 February 1958, episode 90) which you can't get anywhere else. It also claims to have an earlier version of the Ed Sullivan episode (5 April 1959, episode 110) but it's actually the later one (5 November 1963, episode 211) which you can get for less trouble in the Jack Benny - Comedy Pack. If you are contemplating pursuing this collection, be careful not to get the other version which instead of the Race Track episode has the Humphrey Bogart episode (that other version says ""5 DVD Set"" while this one doesn't in case you need a visual aid).  On the other hand, you may pursue Volume 3; periodically other purchasers break up the collection and sell the disks back to Amazon for separate purchase. This is what I recommend, but if you have an overwhelming desire to see Jack as a western con-man regardless of price, then go ahead and grab this box set.

You will find reviews like this one for each of the collections listed above.  May it be a useful tool to navigating the murky waters of Jack Benny DVD's. Also, be sure to watch for Jack Benny on Antenna TV.
