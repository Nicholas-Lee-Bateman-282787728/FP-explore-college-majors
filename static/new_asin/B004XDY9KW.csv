4495349,4,B004XDY9KW,I like anything with Burt Wolf. Travels and info is great. And Paris is one of my favorites cities in the world...,1403568000,,114,4.2272727272727275
4495350,5,B004XDY9KW,"Watched a couple of other travel videos to France and the color was off, scenery not pretty, so this was a delight in contrast.  The color is vibrant, the film work excellent, lots of interesting facts, attractive images and liked the low-key narration.  The scenery starred instead of the narrator.  Like focus on the sights, not the personality of the tour guide.  Really enjoyed this and will watch it again.  This is free with Prime membership which makes Prime a valuable investment.",1395705600,,488,4.902439024390244
4495351,4,B004XDY9KW,"I like Burt Wolf. Always knowledgeable, relaxed, easy to smile and an interesting way to travel on his nickel. Smart man: made a living traveling & doing a very nice job sharing.",1389052800,,178,4.59375
4495352,5,B004XDY9KW,Learned more history and geography of an area I knew little about. I would recommend this if curious about France.,1387238400,,114,4.75
4495353,4,B004XDY9KW,"I haven't seen a Burt Wolf video before watching this one.  Let's get the negatives out of the way first:  The first thing I noticed was that there was a bright green vertical dotted stripe up the right edge of the picture (which is not widescreen, but traditional TV 4:3 ratio format, by the way).  The bright green stripe remained there the entire time, and was a bit distracting at first, but I mostly got used to it.  Then it turned out this appears to be two half-hour shows (minus commercial time, so maybe ~22 minutes each) stitched into one, which is fine.  However, after the end-credits of the first segment (""Cruising Provence,"" copyright 2008) disappeared, it suddenly (around 21:26) jumped mid-show into some other segment, which turned out to be the last 2 minutes of some 2004 Burt Wolf France episode, and then we saw the end credits for THAT show, before it continued (at 23:26) with a complete final episode called ""Cruising France"" (copyright 2008).  At the very end I observed what appeared to be somebody navigating the DVD menu that you'd see if you were watching this on DVD at home.  It's like someone set up a camcorder to record their TV displaying the Burt Wolf DVD and you even get to see them fumbling through the menus.  So the editing of this particular video left something to be desired.

Now the (mostly) positive:  the scenery he shows is beautiful, and he provides a lot of good information.  A few of the segments are quite short, but most are ""normal"" length for a half hour travel show.  His personality (at times quirky & corny) really comes through, fairly often.  But he really makes it look like a place worth visiting, and that outweighs the minor video glitches, in my mind.  And finally, you can't beat the price (free for Amazon Prime customers).  I now plan to watch his Italy show.",1375401600,5,1830,4.622291021671827
4495354,5,B004XDY9KW,"Another enjoyable trip, you will not be disappointed in the scenery, his choices of spots to visit and, of course, the food.",1374624000,2,124,4.681818181818182
4495355,3,B004XDY9KW,"This is typical Burt Wolf, if you like his PBS series (which this is probably from), you'll enjoy this video.",1372291200,,109,4.5
4495356,5,B004XDY9KW,I can rate all of Burt Wolf travel videos the same good listening and good watching. Informative but fun. Burt adds his own personality to the travel and we enjoy it.,1364601600,,166,4.387096774193548

4495358,5,B004XDY9KW,Excellent.  Burt Wolf's wit and knowledge of the local customs and sites of some of France's famous landmarks and regions is a testament to why I keep coming back to watch Mr. Wolfe's travelogues !,1353715200,,197,4.628571428571429
4495359,4,B004XDY9KW,"Travel shows are hard to do well when reviewing popular destination places, yet Burt Wolf always seems to find something different and interesting about them. He covers a lot in this one and manages to include some great humor.

4495360,3,B004XDY9KW,This was a nice travelogue but each site was rushed by. Would have been nicer to spend more time in each area. Was ok.,1443139200,,118,3.9583333333333335
