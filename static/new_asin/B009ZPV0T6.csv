8545775,4,B009ZPV0T6,"Bukka (Booker) White had a slick bag of slide licks and runs that he deployed behind his talking blues and raps--sky songs, he called em ('cus he picked the words out of the sky).  Maybe not the deepest blues ever laid down, but they among the most hard driving.  As White himself said,  ""I stomp 'em, I don't peddle 'em.""

In this lesson, Tom Feldmann takes you inside the engine room, shows to to get that drive going and how to deploy those pet licks. White played in several tunings--vestapol, crossnote, spanish and standard. Tom breaks his ideas and licks in each tuning and clearly shows how to get it on. It's all good, but the tunes in crossnote are particularly fun to play. Plus you get to learn how the 'spank the baby (get the lesson and find out).' Another fine production from Tom and the team at SGGW.",1416441600,,817,4.426666666666667
