1094433,2,6305958130,"Something piqued my interest about this film and I screened it only a few days after I got it. Sorry to say it left a bit to be desired. The story revolves around a 30 something Australian surveyor working mostly in the  outback who is visited one night by a lovely woman who turns out to be an  alien. She's not certain where she is, and when she finds out it's Earth,  she's pretty ticked off. Seems we're considered the scum of the universe by  the rest of the galactic brotherhood because of our supposed neglect for  our planet. As a result she's really upset she was sent here for her  assignment (whatever THAT is). She's always on him about something, but  since he's a decent sort, they do manage to strike up a relationship  (complete with ground rules) for at least a short period of time.  As she  has the ability to manipulte space and the way we perceive the flow of  time, she proceeds to zoom him to different parts of the planet (though  they mostly seem like different parts of Australia) to show him how our  neglect for the planet is causing it to get sick in various ways. As they  break off the relationship and she heads back home, he realizes she was  right and begins a campaign to get us all to see the error of our ways and  save the planet. He's successful to the point he becomes a folk hero.  The main problem with this movie is its simplemindedness. She's on him for  all the things we're doing wrong and he offers not one argument. He doesn't  mention Green Peace or the EPA or any of the other organizations doing  wonderful things to make people aware of the problems and come up with  solutions. It's as though he's saying  that she's right, lock, stock and  barrel. I kept wanting for him to put her in her place with a few common  sense observations. Sure, her people can have her zipping around the  universe at the blink of an eye. It takes everything we have just to send a  few people to our nearest satelite. Give us a few years. We'll get there.
That most of the movie consists of them having conversations (mostly  one-sided) in different locations, there isn't a lot going on here. Things  move slowly and I kept wanting more to happen. But it doesn't. This is a  well intentioned movie but the the filmakers didn't seem to realize that  stories rely on friction to keep things going and there just wasn't any  here. You don't get much more than this rather likeable guy getting trashed  for a good hour and a half.",963446400,5,2460,4.373893805309734

1094616,4,6305958130,"This is an interesting  interaction between a human male and an enlightened humanoid female. It is a love story as well as a dialogue on the foibles of mankind's technological development.

The interaction of two majorly different cultures is explored through humour and conflict.

The background of Australia's and New Zealand's (I think) outback is very scenic and used in opposition to cities to make valid points about the problems Man has created for himself in the quest for dubious advances in culture and technology.

It might be considered a modern-day play on the ""Adam and Eve"" Biblical story, and the desire to return to the ""garden"" versus technological advancement and pollution.

I first saw the movie online streaming, and I liked it well enough to buy a copy for my DVD collection.

1094618,5,6305958130,"Alien Visitor is an awesome movie. It's not high tech but it doesn't have to be.
I'll relate some things but won't share everything because of the incredible perspectives it provides.

It relates a story of an alien being from a distance galaxy whereby the alien ends up landing on Earth.
Upon landing and trying to find a way back, the alien finds a man who doesn't believe the alien.
The alien appears quite human but after some events and what the alien can do through advanced mind and evolution...
The man no longer can doubt what is happening.

In any event, the most interesting things involved come from the different ways things are seen and in some ways you are indirectly taught those things.

It's a perspective in and of the future that there's hope for the world.
Good Journey..

1094619,1,6305958130,"The concept I get. Present the theme of humanity's illogical and suicidal nature utilizing aboriginal mythological story-telling as the vehicle. Great idea!

However, there are other obligations to film-making besides concept, such as quality of dialogue, acting and directorial method.

The dialogue was poorly written and at times so boringly predictable that I could quite easily mutter the next several lines to be delivered before they were spoken by the actors.

The acting was amateurish at best. As it concerns Ullie Bivre - this surprised me.

The method for initially hooking the viewer into watching the entirety of this film was gratuitous nudity and the possibility of sex. Will there be another (and perhaps longer) glimpse of Ullie Birve's naked form? Are the Earth man and the alien going to consummate their relationship?

From a directorial standpoint, this tired old gimmick is pathetic and an open admission of project failure from the start.

Save your money.",1330732800,,980,5.25
1094620,2,6305958130,"I purchased this DVD based on viewer comments. I realized right away there would be a problem when the alien arrived as a naked female--with gel-slicked hair and lipstick. The alien's nakedness seemed gratuitous to me and really had nothing to do with the story. Indeed, why should an alien that has a humanoid form be naked? It is a known fact that completely different creatures occupying similar environmental niches tend to behave similarly. Ergo, if this alien is humanoid,clothing would probably be expected--and logical, especially if one was traveling! Here, it was just a weak gimmick--and it's been done better in other films.

Setting aside the alien female's very humanly faddish haircut, I was interested by the idea that she and the man end up dressed similarly (he gives her some of his clothes) and I hoped that all that money saved on fancy alien costumes would be applied in some unexpected ways in the movie.  Alas, no. The dialogue is more wooden than a cedar barbecue plank, and the sudden ""falling in love"" is so contrived and fake that a whole shipyard of herring is rotting in Denmark even as we speak. The ""Save the Earth"" philosophy dished out by the alien visitor is so heavy-handed and insulting, it sticks in your craw. Instead of listening to this idiot alien, you keep hoping the man would fix his jeep and get the hell away from her.

I wish the film makers had given greater thought to both concept and dialogue and made this into a beautiful parable instead of a pro-conservation rant, and a tepid one at that. (I'm a supporter of the Nature Conservancy,by the way, so I do try to put some money where my mouth is.) Worst of all, as written the script keeps talking down to the film audience as if none of us have ever heard of the evils of the combustion engine. There is some nice photography of the Australian outback but it is not in any way exceptional and certainly not strong enough to save this rather poor contribution to the fantasy genre.

Bad as it is, this film would be excellent for a film class on how not to shoot or write a movie, and for  conservation or environment lectures to point out all of the potential this movie had missed by trillions and trillions of miles...",1307750400,3,2223,4.589420654911839
1094621,5,6305958130,"Alien Visitor is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it is not even really sci-fi. It is more of a ""date movie"" that talks about relationships and the beauty of nature. The ""alien"" part is mostly a vehicle to allow time-and-space skipping to some of Earth's most wonderful places.

The sound advice about relationships has more depth than any Hollywood movie that I can think of, and the scenery is quite gorgeous.

It is mostly two people, with very different backgrounds, who talk and share and find that they have more in common than not.

Alien Visitor is one of only a handful of movies that I have wanted to keep.",1302739200,,623,4.544642857142857

1094623,4,6305958130,"While watching this movie, I was reminded of the scene in ""Contact"" when the alien entity said ""We are a very interesting species. We have the most beautiful dreams and the most horrible nightmares"".

If you really look as us OBJECTIVELY, we very well could be thought of as a barbarian species. From afar, we are a brutal, violent, and distructive species. We destroy each other and our planet for personal power and wealth.

That is our history. The question is if we can possibly change our nature in time...  we can always have the beautiful dream.",1265068800,,552,4.670103092783505
1094732,5,6305958130,"This is a wonderful movie for many reasons. Although, the cover is a tad ""cheezey"". First I feel Aussie movies are more pure to the subject and not masked with all the Hollywood effects. Plus, it portrays how our planet is being consumed slowly and ultimately destroyed in time but the only occupant able to do so, people. Years ago I sent it to a friend who teaches high school. She made it mandentory for all her classes to view. If you care about the earth then watch this.",1240963200,2,476,4.359550561797753
1094733,3,6305958130,"When my dvd's were stolen this is one of the movies I rebought, so it does have something worth watching. Whether that's the charm of the movie, dare I say 'quaintness' (you'll understand if you watch the movie), the awesome cinematography of the Australian landscape, the gentle eco message or simply the understated characters I don't know. But its still not a five star movie.

It would be except that certain things keep getting under my skin as I watch it. Chief among them the hypocracy of the message. The woman 'She' comes to Earth and is horrified by the mess we're making of it, fine. But then she comes from a world were people can travel through space and time simply with the power of their minds alone. If we could do that, pollution would be halved overnight. We wouldn't need cars or planes. That's like going back to the stone age and laughing at our ancestors because they have to walk.

She calls us dumb, again fine from her advanced perspective, but then she falls in love with one of us 'thicko's' doesn't seem to understand that we can't get by in our world without cars etc without her mystic powers, our society would actually collapse, and then to top it all off has a childish tantrum on a battered old landrover. Is that really that bright? Especially when the message the film should be trying to get across is not that we're dumb, but that we are blind in part to the damage we do to our world and apathetic in part. If its stupidity that's our problem then we're actually in seriously bad shape, we can always get more environmentally aware, but in the end we will still need new technological advances to solve our problems. Is she dumb for not understanding that?

But the greatest failing this film has for me is in the complete lack of solutions it provides. Call me an ignorant, polluting, eco vandal, I can live with that, but if you're going to do that offer some solutions, solar power, wind power, recycling, and if you're really an alien with super intelligence, how about throwing in a few new ones that we primitives might not have thought of.

Still the movie makes a point and an impact, and thats something.",1194652800,4,2153,4.526992287917738
1094734,5,6305958130,"Short and to the point...pick this one up. You won't be disappointed. An ECO/scifi movie you say? Yes...and it works. IF you care about our polluted Earth, this movie will touch a cord in you. Nuff said...",1168819200,3,205,4.5675675675675675
1094735,5,6305958130,"This movie is quite original! It's dream-like quality is simply delightful. I thought to myself while watching this film, ""imagine what could have been accomplished with a larger budget and a harder edge!"" This is a subversive story, one that conservatives will detest. With chests puffed-out they will sing the following chorus: What gives the ""right"" to an ""outsider"" to condemn our destruction of the environment and ostracize our way of life? A filmmaker with guts, that's who!

The love affair between two lonely strangers, is shown to be both confusing and inspiring. While one being is obviously an alien with a unique ability to control time & place, she is in some ways, all too human! How ironic!

While message movies are, for the most part, out of vogue. I dearly hope that when they come back in fashion they tackle issues regarding the health of the environment with a vengeance!",1114992000,4,893,4.868421052631579
1094736,5,6305958130,"What can I say, this movie is so good because of the way it shows humanity at both its unconciously worse and its highest potential.  The centre of the story is a slowly building romance between an alien woman who sees earth as nothing more than a planet slowly commiting suicide, and a man who thinks things are pretty nice.
This film is a deep ecology showpiece, because it suggests that another life is possible besides the heavy industrialised one we have accepted as a default.  I definitely ramped up my bicycle riding after watching.  The jusxtaposition of the highway scenes over against the natural world is particularly powerful.
If you are looking for Star Trek you will be dissapointed, but if you are open to being taken on a world tour from a slightly different perspective then you are in for a treat.",1070582400,5,816,4.652777777777778
1094737,5,6305958130,"Alien Visitor is a rare opportunity to view a well acted, brilliantly scripted and directed film that raises more questions than it answers. Alien Visitor is NOT (as it's title suggests) a science fiction thriller. It is the story of a woman from Epsilon who is abandoned on Earth - how and why is somewhat unclear. She meets a surveyor in the remote Australian outback and the story unfolds from there. Alien Visitor's themes revolve around relationships and our place in the universe, themes not often seriously explored in modern film. There are only five actors in the film, an elderly woman narrator, her two small granddaughters, and simply She and He - another rarity in film.
There are so few movies with an ecological message for the planet - this one resonates in a quiet yet powerful way. Readers of Daniel Quinn's book Ishmael will relate with the themes explored here. 5 stars!!",1053907200,9,891,4.792207792207792
1094738,4,6305958130,"If you are looking for a movie that reaffirms our age-old grandiose claims of being the superior life force, then this is not the movie for you. This movie dares to make you think, and dares to go against the grain. The visitor is a female who gets assigned to earth; the dregs of the universe, to try and convince us that what we are doing on this planet will cause us to become extinct. She uses the frog in a boiling pot analogy. If you place a frog in a pot that has boiling water it will leap out. If you place a frog in a pot of water and then start the fire under it, the frog will stay in the pot until it dies. The Earth, according to her, is the boiling pot that we are in. Like the frogs we are content to stay in the pot until we die. The alternative it to take drastic action to change how we use the Earth's resources and stop taking them for granted.
 She chooses to approach a surveyor in the Australian outback. She decides that he will be the one she will attempt to convince and in turn he will carry the message to others. The movie then focuses on her efforts to convince the earthling of the urgency of her message. The bluntness of her message and its humbling nature will offend some viewers, which I think is a good thing. The fact that the alien character is a female will offend others who may think she needs to be ""put in her place"" as one reviewer stated. This is a being that can manipulate time, zip through distances covering millions of light years in a matter of seconds, so it is obvious that she knows her place. I love the fact that this movie offends some people. Indeed I felt uncomfortable in some parts, and that is the beauty of this movie. It dares to make us feel uncomfortable.
The movie also makes other points such as our inability to handle pure honesty and how we play games. At one point she is point blank honest with the human, and he is offended. So she goes away, manipulates time to go back to the moment and this time she strokes his ego, which is effective. I love this movie because it is unpretentiously honest.
If you want action, or if you are not into thought provoking movies then this one is not for you. If you want a creative, sensitive and thought provoking experience, then see this movie. This is great science fiction the likes of which Asimov would have been proud of.",1004659200,10,2340,4.223214285714286

For most this would prove slow, but for writers and filmmakers the pacing and style of ""juxtaposition"" and camera work are terrific. It goes to show what one can do with ""use what you've got"" then some over-done/cheesy special effect. I found the screen presence of both main actors well ""underplayed"" although, some more emphasis on the developement of the relationship would have been nice, overall the film was well worth the watch and perhaps a purchase.",972259200,4,551,4.75

While it is true that we see  no sleek space ships, ray guns, or interstellar battles, the film is rich  in its storytelling and a modern mythology that makes historians and  anthropologists (yes, guilty as charged) smack their lips.  The principals  have no names other the ""She"" and ""the Wandering Man""  but they fill the roles of ancient goddess and true believer which  populates the creation and renewal stories, originally in an oral tradition  but later written, which have survived from countless ancient  civilizations, whether from the Near East, Africa, Aboriginal Australia or  Native North America.  Myth transcends time and the place is always the  same: Earth!

Its gem is in the dialogues, after all almost the entire movie is about a conversation of the two main characters and this reminded me of those Before Sunrise/Sunset movies. But this one has something that makes you feel like traveling through time and space and you don't feel it until it is over. It is a lot more subtle and profound because it is a dialogue of two creatures coming from complete opposites and yet falling in love to each other.

Liked very much the subtlety of the ""second chance"". It is really beautiful...
