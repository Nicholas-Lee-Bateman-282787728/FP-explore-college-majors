3426781,5,B001993Y9A,"It appears Murphy Brown has the same problem as WKRP in Cincinnati. Music is essential to these shows. Murphy loves Mo-Town. To show the original versions, companies have to pay the fees for using the music. WKRP optioned to go forth with other music. The result in my opinion is horrid. Too bad we can't have some co-branding. Waive the music fees, release the other seasons, and sell packaged Murphy Brown Mo-Town music on iTunes (and CD).",1386460800,17,441,4.740259740259741

As TV has gotten progressively worse, we are opting instead for DVDs of old series, and have recently aquired Northern Exposure, Taxi, Golden Girls, and Cheers.  If these are available on DVD, what the heck is WB waiting for?  Let's face it, the cost of producing a DVD when you own the rights has got to be minimal.  Marketing won't be an expense as it will sell itself among Murphy's anxious fans-just give it to Amazon and we'll do the rest!  We don't need fancy packaging - a paper bag will do me fine.  Just get it out there!  After all, any profit is better than no profit at all!  Candace, Diane, anybody - can you help us???",1363305600,2,753,4.328571428571428

This show as on for 10 years. You have DVDs of TV shows that were bombs and only on for 1 or 2 seasons. This show won Emmy's.  It was also well written, well acted and hysterically funny with all the character interaction.  One of my favorite episode is when they are trapped in a motel room in FL during a hurricane.
This show will be top of the charts if it is ever published. 10 seasons to sell!  there is no show on TV that is as good as Murphy Brown on right now.  There are shows that are on DVD and are not this good: alias smith and jones, emergency, facts of life, and good times and others. these were great shows, but they did not have the depth, acting and talent of Murphy Brown.

3426786,5,B001993Y9A,"Along with all the people that made this their favourite show (for god's sake, why else did it last all of 10 seasons), I loved it.

3426787,5,B001993Y9A,"Murphy Brown was consistently in the top 10 for the most part of it's run while it was on TV, yet all Warner Bros. has chosen to release is season 1 and with very little marketing.  I don't understand it.  The only thing I can think of is maybe the righteous right is still smarting from the whole debacle with Dan Quayle thinking Murphy Brown was a real person that they threatened Warner Bros. with something that prevents the release of the rest of the season.  Even I have to admit that would seem too far fetched but they've never given a reason.  And with all off the drivel they and other studios are pushing down our throats to get our money, I guess ""quality"" has to suffer so they can focus more on importing videos from overseas.  Yeah, I'm ticked.  C'mon Warner Bros., what gives?",1353196800,3,792,4.390410958904109

I mean some companies probably have many seasons of stupid stuff like My Mother the Dog...or was it the Horse...or the Car? out on DVD.

Somewhere an ad for ALL the seasons pops up on my computer....probably bootlegged stuff, but if the legal stuff isn't out pretty damned quick, I may have to order the illegal, much as I would hate to.

3426812,5,B001993Y9A,"Apparently the reasons for WB not issuing any other seasons of this top-rated long-running show is the licensing fees for the music, and understandably, I'm sure Motown/Universal are making them pay through the nose for those classic tunes used in every show. Low sales of the first season didn't convince WB to invest into more sets. I have no idea how Shout Factory survives releasing all those great shows the original studio didn't want to, but if they can make it, WB do license them the show, but only if they keep the original music.",1281744000,9,540,4.6947368421052635

3426815,5,B001993Y9A,"Just look at how long discriminating fans have been screaming for the release of the rest of the Murphy Brown series.  You mean that the intellectually-challenged weenies who are helming Warner Brothers can't figure out a way to make a profit on this?  A release of a top-rated, Emmy-laden series (record number of wins, just for Miss Bergen alone)should be a no-brainer. FIND a way to market it---for crying out loud, Warners,a few of us fans can do it for you and you won't even have to pay us. We'll pay YOU. The ensemble cast has a very real, very funny chemnstry, and it's well put together---especially in the seasons that were influenced by Diane English and Barnet Kellman. It's a crime to keep it locked in a vault. Sure, there are heavier-duty problems in the world, but they'd be a lot easier to take if we had something funny to see in the meantime. And ""Murphy"" sits on the shelf while some absolute garbage is released on DVD regularly.

3426819,5,B001993Y9A,"Warner Bros should really get their act together and come into the 21st Century as they look like after-market dinosaurs compared to the other studios. This was *the* biggest show they had during the late 1980s-mid-1990s and Murphy was a Top 5  show in the States for season after season during its highly successful run.

I cannot understand, for the life of me, why 1st Season sales would have been bad to not even entertain the idea of a 2nd Season DVD. It's the next couple of seasons too that had the biggest ratings for the show after it found its feet.

3426820,5,B001993Y9A,"Murphy Brown, a TV character interpreted by the tremendous acting skills of Candice Bergen, was a delight to watch during it's weekly run. The show had a huge audience and touched the lives of so many people right on up to the Vice-president of the United States! Murph was straight up with friend and foe alike. She reacted to life's problems with the courage and zeal of Muhammed Ali in and outside of the ring. Watching her made you want to jump up, shout, and carry on just as if at ringside. Ms Bergen's skills with comedy makes me wonder if her father's peers on Broadway, such as Jack Benny, Burns and Allen, et al. rubbed off on her young shoulders. Like Lucille Ball she didn't care how she looked - she just wanted the laugh that brought so much joy to viewers! That's greatness, and the cast of Murphy Brown brought it to us each and every show they produced. It's been too long a wait for the release of the other seasons; can't someone get the process accelerated? Has anyone contacted Ms. Bergen? Murphy Brown wouldn't have put up with this wait!!

If you were one of the people who made MURPHY BROWN a number 1 hit when it originally aired on TV, write a review and demand the DVD release of ALL it's seasons. Write a review on every website you have written a review on and, who knows. Maybe there ARE a few smart executives out there taking a look at what the public wants. What have you got to lose? Every time I watch an episode from the ONE season I found on DVD, I ache to see more. The characters are amazing together and Candice Bergen is perfect as the sarcastic Murphy.

Why? - Well the answer is the overpriced and overblown self-importance of the Music rights. under the control of agents who extract the maximum fee for even just a few bars of a tune or which the original song-writer may only ever see a few pennies in his or her annual royalty cheque (check). My guess is that Warner Bros. never saw enough sales of the Season One DVD box set to get even a half-decent profit from that series. The law of diminishing returns has decreed that even stripping out the original music from the remaining seasons, and only paying royalties for the original song writers and have cover acts replacing the original performers, will never carry enough sales of DVDs to warrant the release of the renaining seasons. The smarter British bands and performers like ""The Who"" (""CSI"", ""CSI- Miami"" & ""CSI New York"") and David Bowie (""Life on Mars""& ""Ashes to Ashes"") are laughing all the way to the back because they were able to negotiate reasonable fees for the use of their music in soundtracks for these respective TV shows and has given their music extended life and reached out to new generations. I know many young people who cannot believe that the music in the CSI tvs shows are close to 40 years old!. It is a shame that the music industry have left themselves with their knuckles dragging in the mud with their greedy business models and their mind-set bolted on to last century's music industry paradigm. The newer TV producer's these days are playing it smarter and are negotiating with artists directly for original music to use in soundtracks for TV shows. It is also a reason why so much classical music is used in music & TV soundtrack scores where the copyright has expired and is freely available in the public domain.",1421625600,8,1942,4.615606936416185

My Grand Daughter knows all the songs and along with my children and I, We want the rest !!! Can't imagine that the sales on that which exists has been so poor, that  producing MORE would not be indicated and a great success......Patsy P and Sophia G....Granny and GD......",1405382400,5,442,4.432098765432099
8272759,5,B001993Y9A,"After reading some of the other ""reviews"" that basically are begging to give their money to someone for the remaining seasons of ""Murphy Brown"", it should become obvious why this country is so screwed up.  Many people (usually the richest ones) want to work once and then continue to be payed for it forever.  Because of the legal system in this country, this gives them the power to hold the rest of us hostage if their greed is not satisfied.  This applies to other fields than the issue of music involved here.

Their standard responce is that they are just obeying the law, but a) their lawyers helped write these laws, and b) there is nothing stopping any of the artists or groups from charging a trivally small fee to release shows like ""Murphy Brown"".  The net result is that both sides hire even more expensive lawyers to either loosen or tighten the laws ""protecting"" the performers, the artists, or more probably the large corporations that control the rights to whatever is in contention.

I hope this will change someday, but I doubt it will.",1404604800,3,1054,4.6702702702702705
