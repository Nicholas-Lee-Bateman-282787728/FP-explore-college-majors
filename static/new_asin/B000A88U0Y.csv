8076177,5,B000A88U0Y,Another great Susan Harris workout. Been working out with her for decades,1473206400,,73,5.166666666666667
8076178,5,B000A88U0Y,I am an advanced excerciser and was afraid this would be too easy for me but I was in for a nice surprise! I love Susan Harris and have yet to be disappointed in any of the workouts that I've tried by her. I did work up a sweat during this and now that I'm 48 and have had several injuries it's nice to have more Mat workouts in my collection as a change from hard core workouts. I also love Firm Volume 1 with Susan as well as Volume 4 and FitNess Favorites Original Time Crunch,1431993600,5,479,3.948453608247423

8076180,5,B000A88U0Y,"Not picking on Tamela Hastie, though I do prefer this original to the remake. Susan Harris is such a mature, soothing instructor. I also prefer the added hand weight movements that are missing from the newer version. I feel more thoroughly worked out. Great 45 min. workout which will leave you relaxed and tired in a good way.",1183680000,13,327,4.655172413793103
8076181,5,B000A88U0Y,Susan Harris is an awesome instructor. I love this workout and was glad I could find it in DVD format!! Light airy background---kinda like old style firm workouts. AWESOME!!!,1179014400,9,174,5.0344827586206895
