6490611,3,B00LLV9XJQ,"Story is broken down into different chapters describing each character, which sometimes is more confusing. There is really no continuous flow of the movie as each segment runs on its own course. So, at the end, one merely gets familiar with the characters, where they came from, and how they get to the tournament. By the way, the end is not the end yet as the tournament has not even begun. Another sequel is coming..................",1414627200,,434,4.8

6490616,5,B00LLV9XJQ,"Mortal Kombat Legacy II officially drops tomorrow, picking right up where the first season left off and despite the many casting changes and slight shift in direction it doesn't miss a beat. This season brings us Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Cyrax, Ermac and the younger Sub-Zero. Not appearing this year are Jax, Sonya, Shao Kahn, Baraka, Kano, Quan Chi and Queen Sindel. New actors for this season include Casper van Dien (Johnny Cage), Eric Jacobus (Stryker), Michelle Lee (Mileena), David Lee McInnis (Raiden) and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Shang Tsung).  All told you get ten episodes of high-octane enterainment.  Not to mention blood, broken bones, a few cuss words and lots of fatalities.

MK Legacy II is still full of the energy and spark that revitalized the franchise and continues to breathe new life into it. The gritty realism spin that superheroes, et al, undergo in this new millennium is exactly whats needed: no more cartoonish stylings with a wink and a nod to the audience. Liu Kang is no longer the Noble Hero, instead portrayed as a borderline sociopath hell bent upon vengeance. Kung Lao is more akin to what Liu Kangs character used to be- noble and self-sacrificing yet no longer living in Lius shadow. Hes the big brother in the relationship, and their conflict pushes Liu Kang towards the one person wed never thought to see him with.

Synopsis: ***Mini-Spoiler Alert***

A down and out Liu Kang thrashes some local hoods in a bar. Kung Lao comes to aid his old friend and former brother but too much remains between them. We soon learn why Liu Kang is so bitter towards Kung Lao: a flashback shows Liu having left the monastery for a secular life with the woman he loves only to lose her to a senseless act of violence. Meanwhile, Raiden has begun welcoming his Earthrealm Warriors to Outworld and were introduced to Kenshis origins and his encounter with the demon Ermac. Kitana and Mileena hunt Johnny Cage in Outworld; Kitana begins to suspect Shao Kahn treachery, forcing a confrontation with Mileena- who reveals her true nature. Scorpion and Sub-Zero return in a flashback to feudal China to witness the culmination of their tragedy. In present times, Liu Kang continues his downward spiral, prompting a visit from Shang Tsung.

The best parts in the series so far were the tweaking of Raiden, Johnny Cage and Scorpion's characters. Raidens is the most intriguing: along with a new actor his origin gets a complete revision and its the best this season has to offer. Ill ask you: what do you think would happen to a man who appeared out of nowhere claiming to be the God of Thunder and was here to save the world from destruction?

Johnny Cage finally becomes someone you can identify with, not simply goof on.  The rise and fall of a Hollywood star is a tale we're already familiar with- both in real life and in the franchise- but now we finally get to see the man behind the sunglasses.  And you'll like him.

The saga of Scorpion and Sub-Zero felt a little lacking. The most intriguing story arc in the franchise had one of the more pivotal episodes this season, but also the shortest. The history between these two fighters is one of the things weve been waiting for, but still comes off a bit trite and rushed.  As much as there was to their story, it could've used a little more.

Kenseis story was decent, nothing special. Kitana/MIleena comes to an all too soon and unsatisfying resolution, and the cliffhanger ending to the season will naturally make you want just a little more, just one more fight to close it out. But you cant deny it won't have you looking forward to a Season 3.",1413158400,10,3614,4.700949367088608

6490651,5,B00LLV9XJQ,"So this one was a little different from MK Legacy I. Here's what I like about it and why it is worth purchasing:

(1) The fight scenes are good. The acting leaves a little something to be desired, but it's still better acting than MK Legacy I. You can tell the writer put his money into excellent fighters and not actors, which I can appreciate.

(2) It shows a darker side of Liu Kang, and how he came to be. They also use Kung Lao to develop Liu Kang's character.

(3) Johnny Cage is less of a d-bag in this one, and he looks older and a bit anguished.

(4) Kenshi's story was good. I liked the use of telepathic powers, and some of the sword moves he uses are exact replicas of his moves from Deadly Alliance.

(5) The Kitana/Mileena fight is really good, and I liked the dynamic between the two characters. Also, their outfits were fabulous hahaha

Some things I didn't quite get:

(1) I'm not used to Raiden being of Asian descent. I always thought he was supposed to be more Caucasian looking? At least that's what I gathered from previous movies/video games.

(2) Wasn't Kung Lao an ancestor of Liu Kang? I thought that's what was implied in Deadly Alliance.

(3) They didn't have time or the budget to cover all the characters, so some of the key ones had to be left out.

(4) It is slow getting going, but keep watching because it gets really good.

These MK Legacy movies could be what paves the way for a great MK movie. We have to understand that the guy who made these movies had only a few days to shoot all the scenes, and he was paying for everything out of his own pocket. So we need to support him.",1444348800,,1616,4.248366013071895
