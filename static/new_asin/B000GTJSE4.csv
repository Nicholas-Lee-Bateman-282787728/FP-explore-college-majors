2617357,4,B000GTJSE4,"The characters all live on an East European collective farm that is surrounded by bogs and therefore cut off from the rest of the world during the rainy season (and for much of the film it is raining).
I grew up on a farm and so the wandering livestock, the run down barns, the old houses with peeling wallpaper, and the sense of being isolated from the outside world didn't strike me as being particularly depressing or dreary. In fact I found the atmospheres of this film (both geographic and psychic) to be quite familiar.
The people, however, were not familiar. Those who occupy this collective farm are not the friendly country people I remember growing up around; they possess none of the charm and character and voluntary simplicity of rural folk. Rather the characters on this farm appear to be more like stranded exiles from some film noir universe (perhaps from one of Jim Thompson's gritty novels) and to them farm living holds all of the rustic charm of a gulag on the Siberian steppe. To a person they would all rather be elsewhere. The characters discuss leaving and venturing out toward that imagined elsewhere beyond the bogs but perhaps because it is the only reality that they have ever known nothing ever comes of the talk. Its also possible that they are all nihilists who have simply accepted spiritual and material defeat as inevitable. Either way the ideal of communal living--of working for a common good-- has long been abandoned. The individual members are not particularly friendly with or trusting of their neighbors; in fact everyone seems to be scheming against everyone else. The backstabbing competitiveness on display in Tarr's films has led some to conclude that Bela Tarr is making some kind of anti-capitalist statement and I think that there is probably some truth in that observation but its not the whole truth; what pains these characters is not just that the economic collectivity of the communist era has been replaced by the economic competitiveness of the new capitalist Hungary but the feeling that there is nothing else besides money (or petty bureaucratic rationalism) holding the world together any longer. Perhaps this feeling was always there but simply remained unspoken during the communist era. I think that this is also likely. What pains these characters (under any economic system, under any material conditions) is the radical sense of uncertainty and emptiness that marks human life. And this uncertainty and emptiness is psychically debilitating. Though each character reacts to this state of things in a different way, each is overwhelmed by the utter meaninglessness, the inconsequence, of doing anything. It is not merely an economic sickness but the existential sickness of modernity that plagues every character in this film. Nature itself is no longer seen as an escape from the ills of modernity, in fact nature is no longer idealized at all; rather ""nature"" ( both physical environment and human essence) is something that these characters have been reduced to. Art exists on this collective farm but the creation of art, like everything else, is simply a mechanical activity without redemptive or transformative power or purpose.

Intellectuals will be quick to see this film as following in a long line of existential philosophers, novelists, poets, and filmakers: Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, T.S. Eliot, Faulkner, Frost, Camus, Beckett, Bresson, Bergman, Fellini, Polanski, Tarkovsky, Fassbender, Wenders, Lynch...

Its not at all surprising that the late Susan Sontag praised this film (although the earlier Damnation, 1988, was her favorite from this director) as she long expressed an interest in austere and difficult art that could also be construed as spiritual (or at least art that searched for some remnant of the spiritual even amid the ruin of modern or postmodern life). It was of course Sontag who staged Beckett's Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo in 1993 while the city was under siege by Serb forces. Tarr's Satantango (completed in 1994) is a product of the same historical moment; like Sontag, Tarr created a work of art about a society that had crumbled and left its inhabitants without the support of a civilization. Like the characters in Beckett's plays, Tarr's characters maintain a sense of order only by repeating the same activities over and over again, but they are ultimately powerless to cover up the void that is left within them.

This is compelling cinema. Though the characters may be rather ""grubby"" (as Jonathan Rosenbaum said in his review of the film) the slow pacing of the film and the austerity of the black and white cinematography has an undeniable spellbinding effect. Its as if Tarr has slowed everything down and cast the entire world in black and white so that we can see more clearly what is at stake as these characters struggle to resist the paralyzing ennui of unredemptive time.",1225929600,4,4891,5.050742574257426
2617358,1,B000GTJSE4,"I'm afraid to say, that despite ALL of Facets' posturing, they've done a lackluster job on this truly important film. An unconverted PAL source with tons of ghosting and combing. NON-ANAMORPHIC and interlaced. But the Artificial Eye version. It's not super, but it's a lot better than this typically poor job.",1216166400,27,309,5.078431372549019
2617359,4,B000GTJSE4,"The famous opening shot of Bela Tarr's ""Satantango"" is done in a single take lasting seven minutes. It is of a herd of cows walking across an empty landscape as the camera pans from right to left.

This is not exactly the kind of shot which would thrill most American audiences. And it may be for that reason Hungarian filmmaker Tarr has not quite gained fame in this country.

""Satantango"" is a 7 hour film consisting of extreme long shots done in single takes lasting minutes on average. It was shot in black&white, as are most of Tarr's films.

Originally released in 1994 ""Satantango"" went on to achieve some fame on the international festival circuit. Only now has Facets released the film on DVD. It will be available next week in a three disc set. Since I use to intern at Facets, and this was one of the films I worked on, I received an advance copy. When the DVD is available to the public, it will become, in my opinion, the major DVD event of the year! Finally this masterpiece can now find a larger audience.

Going back to the first image in the film, many people are going to shake their heads, why? What does this mean? Why is Tarr showing us cows? I think this shot is important for many reasons. First of all it sets up the fact the film takes place in a small village. We are among the poor, working class. The land is deserted. No one takes care of it and no one seems to be watching those cows. And could the herd of cows represent the characters in this film? At one point we hear a character describe the others as a ""herd"". The characters may be wondering aimlessly just like the cows searching for meaning, a purpose. Of course these aren't answers, merely suggestions.

But ""Satantango"" is filled with images like this with shots which run just as long. Tarr leaves the camera on moments viewers will find boring, whether is it animals, landscapes or a character's face, Tarr's films are loaded with scenes other directors would throw out and leave on the cutting room floor. But Bela Tarr and ""Satantango"" represents a different kind of story-telling.

I think the reason Tarr has shot last so long is to put us in a trance, to lull us. I'm reminded of the story told about Werner Herzog. Supposedly he hypnotized his cast in the film ""Heart of Glass"" to get a dreamlike quality out of them. Tarr too wants to hypnotize us. He wants to viewer to feel uneasy. He wants to attempt to calm us down. When you look at most American films with their rapid edits, the films consist mainly of cuts and jump cuts. Images flash before our eyes so fast sometimes we can't even register what we saw. Tarr comes from a tradition of filmmaking similar to Tarkovsky, Angelopoulos and Antonioni. He takes his time setting up a shot and lets the story move at its own rhythm.

There is not much of a plot to ""Satantango"". If the film had been told in a more conventional manner it would not take 7 hours to tell. The film follows 8 people from a small community who have put their money together just to be conned by two men thought to be dead; Irimias (Mihaly Vig) and Petrina (Putyi Horvath). These men promise a new life for the people by moving them to a new village where better work can be found. But the villagers not only are suspicious of the two men but each other as several have planned to steal the money themselves. Tarr seems to be making a commentary of greed and capitalism. Many critics regard the film as a commentary on the end of communism. I'm not sure I'm willing to go that far, as Tarr claims he is not a political filmmaker, but there is an undertone of corruption and greed. One character even says people are afraid of freedom but there is nothing to be afraid of. Order though can be frightening. Is this the freedom of democracy and the order of communism?

Despite the simple plot what makes ""Satantango"" such a must see are the visuals. Tarr gets some truly beautiful shots. The very first time we see the two con men they are walking in the middle of the street as a strong wind storm blows garbage around on the sidewalks. The shot last for two minutes but it is amazing. Another scene does a 360 degree turn, in a close-up, on a woman's face. What's the point? Not a clue, but fun to look at.

One scene which bothers a lot of people is a sequence where a young girl, Estike (Erika Bok) kills her cat. A lot of people wonder why would she do it. Why would Tarr have such a scene? I think this is a reflection on the hierarchy of power. The girl's mother bullies her as does her friend. But who can she bully? She picks on the cat. It is similar to the way the two strangers bully the town into giving them their money. Those who feel they are strong pick on the powerless and defenseless. What match is the cat for the young girl? The girl incidentally is on the cover of this DVD.

""Satantango"" also marks, at the time, the second collaboration between novelist Laszlo Krasznahorkai and Tarr. The two had worked on ""Karhozat (Damnation)"" previously and continued their work in ""Werckmeister harmoniak (Werckmeister Harmony)"" and Tarr's most recent film ""A londoni ferfi (The Man From London)"". These films show a shift in style on Tarr's part, from his early films which were docu-dramas which made social commentaries on communist life. Now Tarr has become more psychological.

And what about the film's title? The movie is divided into twelve chapters. Six of them move the story forward, 6 are flashbacks. The structure is suppose to resemble a tango. But what about the ""satan"" part? Is Tarr showing us hell on Earth? Are these characters experiencing hell? Remember the film Tarr made before this was called ""Damnation"". The very last scene in the film seems to suggest the end is near. The screen fades to black as we hear a character's voice over. The last words heard are of an impending war.

If there is a valid point of criticism (not comments like, the movie is too long, or in black&white, or its in Hungarian) it is that at times you feel Tarr is making more of an experiment rather than a film. I also never seem to enjoy the last act of the movie. Or in this case, disc 3. Here the film shifts its focus from the townspeople to the con men. I love the first two disc and the way Tarr shows the village and the people and who everyone seems to fear the strangers. They have a mystic power over everyone. But once the film starts to focus more on them they seem harmless. Was this Tarr's point? People will fear are only human and should not be feared? Either way I lose interest in the film's final moments.

Facets has also included some special features including Tarr's rarely seen version of ""Macbeth"" which aired on Hungarian television in the early 80s. It was done in two shots.

Anyone who considers themself a film lover will be doing themself a great favor by buying this film. I know 7 hours is a long time to sit through. And I know it is in Hungarian. But after watching this film you will be seeing a master filmmaker at work. Anyone who thinks there is nothing interesting being done in cinema anymore has never seen a Bela Tarr film.",1215907200,36,7109,4.425076452599388
2617360,5,B000GTJSE4,"Ignore the reviews that seemingly refer to older region 2 versions of this film. According to the Facets promotional materials, this release of Satantango (delayed since its originally announced date in the of fall 2006) is the fully restored, director-approved edition. In addition to the film, this DVD set contains Macbeth (1982, 64 mins.), Tarr's rarely seen interpretation of Shakespeare's tragedy famously captured in two shots; Journey on the Plain (1995, 34 mins.), in which actor-composer Mihaly Vig revisits the Satantango locations; Prologue (2004, 5 mins.), the director's stunning contribution to the omnibus Visions of Europe; About the Restoration (5 mins.); and a Facets Cine-Notes booklet.",1214870400,6,706,5.669811320754717
2617361,5,B000GTJSE4,"It is an exhaustive experience watching Stntang (and I completed my
third viewing in only 6 months) because you feel like you have spent
your entire life with these people.

Despite the minimalism of the film, duly note that the minimalism is
illusory - there were many ordinary images and sounds (which we take
for granted but for the characters comprised their world) which are not
normally accentuated in regular films but are given gratuitous
attention by Tarr - the sounds you mentioned (coins on counter, clocks
ticking, raindrops ticking, etc) and muddy cows, boggy landscapes, bare
and broken tree limbs, benches, debris flowing forward in the wind,
sideboards and cabinets, wooden floors, shot glasses, curtains, average
faces, stormy skies, the blackness of night, etc.

Every single frame is indeed exquisitely and virtuously photographed,
the film is a visual Baroque Hymnal, a Baroque Requiem to fall of
Communism in Eastern Europe.

His flawless tracking shots, the film's plot structure, and the
sequence of events, are all serpentine, cyclical, sequences within the
film that begin at the ending and end at the beginning, sequences that
intersect geometrically, sequences that have equal-but-reversed
spatial, temporal, and narrational points of view.

There is also a plot thread (girl-cat) that serves as a cycle within
each half of the film (one cycle starts near the end and moves forward,
the other cycle starts at the beginning and leads into the end), both
sequences not only overlap, but act as mirrors to each other.

By creating micro and macro spatial and temporal arrangements (which
are based on the pattern if the tango) he literally founded the 4th
dimension of cinema, something that Tarkovsky was trying to do and gave
us glimpses of, he may have succeeded had he lived longer.

The film is a 10/10 profoundly challenging and lateral flight through
time and space during which no time passes and you are consumed by
exquisite photography of a drearily drenched cosmos filled with the
rhythms of ticking clocks and pattering rain and whirring fans and
clicking glasses, your skin feels rain-drenched, your shoes are all
muddy, you danced all night, your mind and body are trapped in a tango
pattern that walking on and on fails to escape, when you land, you miss
the artistry of the debris in flight and the cigarette smoke and the
light shining in during the most inactive empty moments and the
characters' sardonic wit and the clamourous rant of the drunk man and
the girl you want to smack for what she does to the cat, then you
realize you forgot the doctor and you want to hear the bells in the
steeple...",1206835200,7,2642,4.952595936794582
2617362,5,B000GTJSE4,"I'm not going to bore you with the details of the `story' because first of all nothing really happens and secondly it's not important. Mostly its just people looking in and out of windows, walking, or just being, yet that may be what we're doing also by sitting for 7 hours, watching other people by transcending the barrier of celluloid and sharing in their misery. They say the eyes are the windows of the soul and in these Breughelian faces we see the personality of characters shine through and understand their individual and personal agony. This is what elevates this film beyond cinema and art into something more personal like the experience of music. By the end of the film characters feel like real people that we may intimately know.

Parallels are inevitably drawn with the work other directors like Tarkovsky, most notably `Andrei Rublev' (1966) and `Stalker' (1979). Tarkovsky's films had a sense of religious hope whereas Bela Tarr's have none of that yet I felt a certain amount of elation at the end. Albert Camus said that struggling to the height may be enough to fill a man's heart. How true.

This is a film I've waited several years to see since I first saw `Werkmeister Harmonies' (2000) and `Damnation' (1988) on the Artificial Eye DVD release. Rumour circulated for a long time about this eventual release and finally we have it. It's a film more have heard about than actually seen and has always been highly revered among cineastes. Satantango is filled with some of the most remarkable cinematography I've ever seen. So was it worth the wait? Absolutely.

Bela Tarr may be the greatest living director working today.

Highly recommended viewing.",1167091200,19,1673,4.859649122807017
2617363,5,B000GTJSE4,"Living through Stntngo is like being thrown into a dimension diametrically opposite that of our velocity-laden everyday media sensorium, with its its hyperbolic stimulation of the nervous system. Tarr's film, based on a novel by Lszl Krasnahorkai, evokes with equal explicitness the experience of duration -- the ""time-image"" -- found in Tarkovsky's films. Tarr takes his time with each scene, with each chapter of the ""Dance Order"" in which the film is organized. The dance of death, with earth already hell, is the governing metaphor, joined by another powerful one: that of the spider's web, and the intrication in it of victims (both characters and spectators, undoubtedly). The Dance Order runs as follows:

Part One

I. The News That They are Coming

II. We are Resurrected

III. Knowing Something

IV. The Work of the Spider (1)

V. The Net Tears

VI. The Work of the Spider (2)

Part Two

VI. Irimis Speaks

V. The Perspective, When from the Front

IV. Ascension, Feverdream?

III. The Perspective, When from Behind

II. Nothing but Worries, Nothing but Work

I. The Circle Closes

""History is not at an end, nothing is at an end, we can no longer deceive ourselves that anything with us has come to an end; something continues and is retained."" -- Lszlo Krasznahorkai on Stntngo

Stntngo concerns a small town whose factory, its sole economy, has closed, where alcohol dominates everyone's lives, where everyone distrusts each other, where every material thing, building, piece of clothing, gives off the air of dilapidation and impending death, while pure existence and its unendurable duration continues on, and drags the relics of humans and objects with it. If that weren't enough, the rainy season has begun and will continue for months without a single letup.

Only two people hold on, however slightly, to semblance of distance and independence: the Doctor and Irimis, a false prophet who returns, after declaring himself dead, to lead the human remnants into a new era. Both turn out to be informants, linked to the corrupt and capricious power of a state surveillance apparatus. Both practice the art of writing.",1158019200,19,2130,5.04
2617364,5,B000GTJSE4,"Bela Tarr's magnum opus, Satantango, is one of those ""legendary"" films you hear so much about.  It's a monumental work lasting a full 7 1/2 hours when screened in its entirety (which is the only way it should be shown). Does it live up to its reputation?  Is it worth investing one third of an entire day to sit in a theater watching this film?  Yes.  In fact, when one watches it and completely surrenders to the mood and look of the film, one wishes that Bela had made his film longer.  It is a deep, meditative, spellbinding work, a work of a great film artist that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Kubrick and Tarkovsky.

I saw this in a theater in January 2006 after wanting to see it for ages.  The plot, if you can call it that, of this film is it's the story of a failing collective farm in Hungary.  Most of the residents want to take their money and split, but the 2 men in charge of the collective are returning after missing for 2 years.  They're also police informers, but they don't seem to take it as seriously as they should.  That's pretty much it.  Recounting a plot for a film of this magnitude is rather pointless, as it is how Bela Tarr tells the story, not just the story.

It has a non-linear structure, with many things told from different points of view.  Many people made a lot of hay about Pulp Fiction and it's non-linear structure, and how innovative it was.  This film was released the same year (it had started in 1991 but Bela ran out of money, eventually completing it in 1994), and this is a far more complex, artistic film than Pulp Fiction ever can be.  Cinematically, the film is a masterpiece.  The black and white cinematography is fantastic, and the film has roughly 150 shots in the entire film.  Many music videos have over 500 cuts in them, and they run a few minutes.  Here Tarr shows his mastery of the long take. The opening shot, which is very well known to those who have seen the film, runs nearly 9 minutes.  It's a shot of a herd of cows roaming around the countryside.  The camera doesn't even move for 3 minutes until the cows come together and start to roam.  It sets the tone for the rest of the film. Quite often, films with long takes have short ones to offset them. This film doesn't.  It's very meditative, bleak, sad, disturbing, and yet, there are hilarious (yes, hilarious) moments in it as well.  Most people talk about this film in such somber tones. They don't realise that it's OK to have a little humour in an art film.  The sadly late Susan Sontag, a cultural critic who I deeply admire, said about this film ""devastating, enthralling for every minute of its seven hours. I'd be glad to see it every year for the rest of my life.""  She had similar accolades for another 7 1/2 hour film, Hitler: A Film from Germany (aka Our Hitler).  Both times she was right.  These films are worth every second of your time, and then some.  They would make an excellent double featuer.  She also mentioned this film in a scathing essay on the decline of serious film culture in the 1990's, and that Satantango was an unapologetic slap in the face to ""foreign friendly"" films of companies like Miramax.  Many foreign films distributed in the 1990's were designed for crossover appeal.  They were foreign, but had the commercialisation of Hollywood in them.  Tarr's film doesn't.  This is old school auteurism at its finest.  This is a work of art, not a pseudo-intellectual film pretending to be art.  One holds a deep admiration for Bela Tarr for making his film the way he wanted it.  It is one of my all time favorite films.

Facets's DVD is, as some have said here, not particularly good.  The transfer is just average, which is unforgivable in this day and age (go to DVD Beaver for a more detailed analysis of the transfer).  But Facets has added some fascinating extras here, something they didn't do on Werckmeister Harmonies and Damnation, two other Tarr masterpieces.  There's are two short films, Journey on the Plain and Visions of Europe: Prologue, included here, and Tarr's TV film of the scottish play by Shakespeare.  The two shorts are fascinating (Visions is one long take), and the scottish play film is excellent.  It runs 67 minutes long, and is filmed in two takes.  The first take is five minutes, then the credits, then the rest of the film (62 minutes) is all one long take.  It's fascinating to see how Tarr plays it out, but he does superlatively, and makes one of the most memorable adaptations of the scottish play ever made.  So while the transfer is average, the extras are very good, and maybe, just maybe, Facets will take some more pride in their future work and do good transfers.

This is one of the greatest films ever made in my opinion.  It's absolutely fascinating from beginning to end.",1152835200,5,4793,4.494212962962963

2617390,5,B000GTJSE4,"Stntang opens to a languid, insidiously ironic shot of cattle traversing the muddy field of a near desolate, neglected communal farm in rural Hungary, as the cows concurrently attempt to mate during the process of migration. The clumsy and awkward episode is reflected in the fluidly tracked, change of perspective shot of a disheveled, sparsely furnished room where Futaki (Mikls Szkely B.) and Mrs. Schmidt (va Almssy Albert) conduct a meaningless, illicit affair - their relationship summarily encapsulated in the indelicate image of Mrs. Schmidt cleansing herself after the sexual encounter in her lover's presence. With her husband's unexpected return home, Futaki withdraws to an adjacent room and overhears an underhanded scheme hatched between Schmidt (Lszl Lugossy) and Krner (Jnos Derzsi) to abscond with the communal farm's cattle money entrusted to them for delivery into town, with the dream of establishing his own farm. Feigning to arrive at the Schmidt home, Futaki confronts Schmidt with knowledge of their plot and is offered a share of the money in exchange for his silence. However, as Futaki and Schmidt settle their disreputable alliance, Mrs. Schmidt receives word from Mrs. Halics (Erzsbet Gal) that the near-mythical Irimis (Mihly Vig) and his omnipresent assistant Petrina (Putyi Horvth), both presumed to be dead, have been spotted on a road leading to the village, heading towards the local pub. The news of Irimis's unexpected reappearance is received with equal amounts of anticipation and dread, and gradually, the villagers' plight unfolds as a series of point-of-view episodes that explore the root of their anxiety towards the return of the town's prodigal son.

Bla Tarr creates a visually sublime, darkly comic, and understatedly haunting film on complacency, ennui, betrayal, and greed in Stntang. A collaborative adaptation of Lszl Krashnahorkai's first novel, Stntang is intricately structured in twelve narratively overlapping, discontinuous chapters, replicating the visual rhythm of the tango. The inherent nonlinearity of the film's forward and backward episodic movements, particularly evident in the circular, repeated narration of Futaki's perceived detection of the tolling of nonexistent bells at the beginning and end of the film, underscores the banality and empty, ritualistic existence of the communal farmers. Resigned to a life of aimlessness, despair, and passivity, the film serves as a metaphor for the nation's inertial resistance to change and inability to adapt to the unfamiliar landscape of liberation and autonomy in post-communist Hungary. Moreover, the themes of self-entrapment and zero displacement are manifested in the delirious, floating tracking shot above the sleeping villagers that echoes an earlier image of nocturnal spiders that emerge to spin their imperceptible web on the unconscious patrons after their meandering, discordant, intoxicated dance - the titular Stntang witnessed by the deeply troubled, seemingly deranged girl, Estike (Erika Bk) - a reminder of the psychologically entrenched, moribund lives of the villagers on the collective farm.

Through repeated allusions of the charismatic, mysterious Irimis as a messianic figure, Tarr further illustrates the spiritual desolation, gullibility, and moral bankruptcy of the villagers: the static, close-up shots of the inexpressive Irimis that emphasizes his abstracted, seemingly benevolent gaze (reminiscent of Johannes' framing in Carl Theodor Dreyer's Ordet); his figurative return from the dead; his inexplicable compulsion to kneel before the ruins of an abandoned building as fog momentary rolls in and obscures the view; his redemptive speech that galvanizes the villagers into subscribing to his unrealized vision. Like the elusive Godot of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Irimis represents the ephemeral: hope, redemption, sense of purpose, salvation. But inevitably, the model farm proves to be a barren reflection of the villagers' own existential limbo - a bleak, stagnant, and inert wasteland festering in a hopeless, meaningless, and soulless world.",1262736000,6,4104,5.715220949263503
2617391,4,B000GTJSE4,"In 1994, Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr released a seven hour black and white film called Satantango (Satan's Tango in English) that presented a conundrum for both the purveyors of plot-driven, character-empty Lowest Common Denominator blockbuster action summer movies and those who favor the cerebral, pretentious, film school fawning indulgences of Eurotrash (aka World Cinema) film-making. The conundrum was how can time be manipulated by the artist (filmmaker) so that the viewer (percipient) is removed from its passage? No, that theme is never directly stated nor implied in the film's frames, but it is there, and Satantango is a film that, like Chris Marker's La Jetee, will stand as a milestone in cinema history. Like Marker's film, Satantango is a great film, and I will detail and argue such in this essay. But, I believe that it could well be the sort of film that, decades hence, serves as the template for what remains of modern cinema culture.

Critics are often the worst judges of what is original and important when an art form seeks out new means- an online scan of film reviews of old classics often shows how off the mark old line critics were. On a soft tangent, an often abused term crops up far too often in reviews of Satantango, and that is the word 'epic.' In fact, epic is something this film most definitely is not. Epic implies huge spectacle and grand consequences, whereas this film, despite its length, is anything but that. It is intimate and, if anything, anti-epical. In fact, it is almost like a Beckett play on steroids, and one that tests the very premises Beckett based his whole career upon, pushing them to the very limits of their own dictates, and then into something even better, for it has a richness, depth, and humanity that no Beckett play has. Yet, while not epic, the film is very much a visionary work. Many people confuse the two ideals, as if they both connote a grandness, whereas only epic does. Vision, on the other hand, can be small. Quality of her verse aside, much can be stated in favor of the argument that Emily Dickinson was a visionary poet. Her 'vision,' though, was exceedingly small, and this is true of Satantango. The very smallness which makes it an anti-epic also makes it visionary for its vision is that of the microscope, not the telescope, where epics are writ so large. But large things often diffuse, whereas Satantango's length does naught but clarify, even in its depths. And the use of macguffins acts almost as leukocytes to defend the film's narrative from its own length's possible excesses. This defense system is one of the many reasons Satantango is not only a great film, but an important and historic one.",1248825600,2,2695,4.808189655172414
2617392,5,B000GTJSE4,"Satantango (Bela Tarr, 1994)

Americans are used to the idea that movies run between one and a half and two hours. When something shows up in Hollywood that runs two and a half hours or more, Hollywood doesn't know what to do with it. (The main perpetrator of this stupidity seems to be Harvey Weinberg; Miramax are famous for wanting their movies to clock in as close to ninety minutes as possible.) But this is not exclusive to America; the typical Bollywood flick tends to run two and a half to three and a half hours. You get something that runs outside that time limit... well, same idea. So what happens when you get a filmmaker whose vision refuses to fit into such a time frame? If you're part of the western world, you break your movie into a trilogy (or a series), I guess. (Unless you're Kevin Costner and can get away with four-hour epics.) If you're part of the Eastern world, you go to Hungary, where people like revered director Bela Tarr are given all the celluloid canvas they need to paint their masterpieces. Case in point: Satantango, Tarr's most ambitious project to date, which clocks in just shy of seven and a half hours. Yes, that's seven and a half hours. This is not a movie you're going to watch in one sitting; even those times it gets screened at film festivals, they run it in two parts, either on successive days or with a lengthy break in the middle. I have to admit that even I couldn't make it all the way through, as amazed as I constantly was by this film (though that may have had something to do with the rather degraded print I was able to get my hands on; I have high hopes for the Facets DVD set being a much better print, but I haven't been able to afford it yet).

Adapted by Tarr from longtime collaborator Laszlo Krasznahorkai's novel of the same name, Satantango depicts the goings-on in a rural Hungarian village as the country begins the transfer to capitalism. The government has decided that everyone in town is going to get a sum of money; this leads, inevitably (or so Krasznahorkai would have it) to the establishment of a pecking order among the peasants, with the most clever at the top. A few characters, however, sit outside the ensuing carnival and simply observe, with the most notable being the alcoholic town doctor (but if you pay attention, you'll notice a few others doing the same thing--just not as obviously). This is satire, but it's incredibly low-key satire for the most part. If you think British humor is dry...

If you've seen any of Bela Tarr's films (and if you haven't you should, as soon as possible), you'll know what to expect, and why Satantango is as long as it is; Tarr has quite an affinity for long, slow shots, rather like Tarkovsky or Merhige. (According to IMDB's trivia section, the average shot length in Satantango is over two minutes.) And when Tarr isn't playing with ten-minute shots, he's indulging in fifteen-minute pans like the one that opens the movie, showing the village at the beginning of the rainy season. There are no people; there is very little life at all save the occasional passing cow. It's a shot that could have come right out of Tarkovsky's Solaris, and the symbolism is the same, though Tarkovsky was all about the cold lifelessness of technology, while Tarr is, if anything, all about the cold lifelessness of anti-technology (in the guise of socialism). Or maybe he just wants to show how incredibly boring it is in this town where so little has changed since the end of World War II. If so, though, he fails miserably; who'd have thought that a fifteen-minute slow pan around a town square, with nothing but buildings and endless, grey rain, could be so remarkably gripping? I grant you that there will be those, and it's probably a majority of those reading this review, who would watch this shot and find it, in fact, boring. (For a quicker introduction to Tarr's work, take a gander at Damnation. If you find that one boring--it actually has a plot--then Satantango probably isn't the movie for you.) If, on the other hand, you see this shot and you get what Tarr is on about, then the next seven hours and fifteen minutes of this movie will captivate you. I gar-on-tee.

Yes, as I mentioned in the last paragraph, Satantango is essentially a plotless movie. We meet this group of characters, we get to know them, and we see how they interact. There is greed and desperation, yes, but there is also gentleness, love, humor, and the occasional scene of shocking violence. (There is one specific scene I should probably warn you about; animal lovers will want to be on the lookout for points to fast-forward starting about three hours into the movie, going for roughly the next half-hour.) This is possibly the purest example I have seen of a completely character-driven movie that works, and works well.

Satantango is less film than it is experience. It's a piece of Eastern European filmmaking that, like most of those released recently by Facets, is truly must-see TV. (I've been actively resisting comparing it with Kieslowski's Dekalog this entire review, because the two share nothing but scope, vision, and a pretty nice DVD treatment by Facets.) Grab a copy at your local library or video rental store next time you have a free weekend and watch it in two parts. Or, if you're lucky, catch it on the big screen at a nearby film festival; since I first saw this a couple of months ago, one of my life's movie goals has become to find this showing on the big screen somewhere. It's the kind of big, sprawling epic that demands a big screen. And yet, it's a big, sprawling epic in miniature. But the small things here--a character's revelation that someone else has taken advantage of him, or the blossoming of a romance between two highly unlikely people--have just as much impact as any Cecil B. DeMille battle scene with a cast of thousands. Satantango has landed on a number of different thousand-best lists, including those of Jonathan Rosenbaum and Pierro Scaruffi; I can do naught but agree. A film of inestimable power. *****",1238371200,5,6058,4.647388059701493

 At the beginning of Disc2, a young girl must wait outside while her prostitute mother handles a client. It is cold, rainy, dismal and dreary (all trademarks of Bela Tarr's filmic visions). She climbs up into a barn loft and we see her holding a cat, obviously her only companion. She sits there stroking the cat, the cat purring contentedly... then, her mother lets her client out the door and walks back into the house. We are looking down from the loft in the point of view of the little girl.

 She does not like being treated this way and starts taking her frustrations out on her only companion, the trusting, purring cat. She begins the torture by grasping the cat by it's front shoulders and starts rolling back and forth on the floor while still holding the cat and slams it back and forth, back and forth onto the floor as she's rolling. The cat is bewildered and panicked but does not bite the girl, most likely because it still TRUSTS the little girl.

 This cruelty and torture is not satisfying enough for the girl (obviously not for Bela Tarr either) and she let's the staggering cat go, goes down into the house through a back door into the kitchen area and gets some milk from a plastic bag, then, she reaches into a low cupboard drawer and takes out a container (which we assume/hope is sugar) and pours something into the milk dish, puts the container back and takes the milk dish back up into the barn loft. Think she's planning on `making up' to the cat? Eh... NO.

 When she climbs back up into the loft she has to chase the cat through the rafters before she finally captures it again. The milk dish is placed in the foreground, the girl sits behind the dish facing the camera while forcefully holding the cat. She proceeds to force the cats whole face into the milk dish, forcing the cat to drink the milk. The girl smashes the cats face into the milk dish at least three times and we witness the cat licking it's mouth but it cannot escape the girl. After the third time she smashes the cats face into the bowl she sits holding the cat to the camera very rigidly while the cat licks it's face, then, little by little the girl releases her grip and finally lets go of the cat and walks back to 'observe' her work.

 What happens? Well... if you have watched this far you have just witnessed the ONSCREEN POISONING OF A FELLOW ANIMAL! The audience watches while the cat moves less and less until... it dies.

 And THIS? IS CALLED ART!

I've NEVER understood this type of crap being accepted as 'ART'?

Tarkovsky does it numerous times in Andrei Rublev to horses, dogs and cows. Bergman kills a horse in 'The Serpent's Egg' and the ONLY reason we don't see the horse killed and butchered onscreen is because David Carradine threatened to quit the film, so, Bergman had the horse murdered off screen, butchered part of it and dragged the carcass into the road which Carradine has to walk past on film. It is explained to us that in some countries, it is permissible to kill an animal onscreen if there is a licensed Veterinarian on set - how saintly sickening.

 Just like the Hollywood etc. practice of tripping horses to get a good falling shot in Westerns - how many horses were crippled, maimed and were put to death so that we could see a 'cowboy' film?

 There is NO EXCUSE or justification EVER to injure, maim or kill a FELLOW ANIMAL.

 Where Bela Tarr found a young girl to perform this murder is beyond me. DISGUSTING!

8134412,5,B000GTJSE4,"STNTAG is a 1992 film by Bla Tarr that takes the Hungarian director's characteristic style to the extreme: this black and white production, based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-novel/dp/0811220893/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a novel</a>&nbsp;by Lszl Krasznahorkai on the dissolution of a Hungarian collective farm in the 1980s, tells its story through a series of long takes, features little dialogue, and runs for over seven hours. While this kind of cinema is certainly not for everyone, if you have watched and enjoyed the longest films by Andrei Tarkovsky (namely ANDREI RUBLEV and STALKER), the director to whom Tarr is most often compared, then this is something for you.

I invited some friends over to watch the STNTAG on my projector, expecting this to be a trial of endurance where we would give up well before the end (as happened, for example, when we tried to listen to Messiaen's opera&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saint-Franois-d-Assise/dp/B00000JSAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saint Franois d'Assise</a>). Instead, we were enthralled and watched the whole thing without the slightest complaint. The length of this film is a plus, not a minus, as it places the viewer into a hyper-aware state in which one comes to reflect deeply on the detailed world Tarr depicts. One reason that the film runs as long as it does is that Tarr depicts the same action over 24 hours from different characters' perspectives, so we revisit the events again and again, learning something new each time, and this keeps the suspense up. There are images here that I will never forget as long as I live.

As the film opens, eight shareholders in a collective farm in rapidly-privatizing Hungary are waiting to get a large payout for the sale of their cattle, and they expect to then go their separate ways. These farmers are deeply flawed (aren't we all?) and intrigues abound. Some of them are already scheming to sneak away with the others' money. Others await the dissolution of their little community with dread: the collective's doctor, obese and alcoholic, is bound to starve without anyone to look after him, and the youngest child feels something evil is in the air. Enter the sinister figure of Irimis, who had disappeared from the farm long before and was believed dead. He returns with mysterious links to the state, and the last third of the film sets the bickering farmers against the vast country in which they live. While Tarr has denied that he does allegory, his Krasznahorkai source material does seem linked to contemporary Hungary as much as the human experience in general.

Aware of the complaints about the Facets release, I watched the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Artificial-Eye/dp/B000HRLWQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Artificial Eye</a>&nbsp;release of this film, which is Region 2 (UK), so make sure you have a region-free DVD player.

8134413,5,B000GTJSE4,"Over 7 hours long, in Hungarian, with only about 150 edits meaning each shot is up to 15 min long, and ending where an obese doctor boards himself up in his room into complete darkness so he can drink and finish writing his notes, means this is not an easy film.

I had to watch this over a few days since even for me this is too large of an undertaking, but I always looked forward to the next segment and was never bored. Granted, I have an incredibly high tolerance for weird stuff like this, but I was curious about why someone would even make a movie like this - it totally goes against any conventional sense to make this film, even in Hungary with some money raised from the cultural board.

But I'm glad this movie was made. It's uncompromising not only its sheer endurance, but also in its bleakness, its crushing depression, its total and utter hopelessness, its low opinion of all humans, its ideas of cruelty. For seven hours we're subjected to the fate of a communal town of about a dozen people each of whom represent the worst, most cowardly, drunken, whorish, base, foolish, cruel, idiotic, vain, greedy .. it goes on and on. Nobody in this film is a good person and the only person we never see do anything bad is, I'm pretty sure, Satan himself (played by the film's composer).

So then why would this be interesting? Why would watching a herd of cows roam around a deserted farm village for 10 min with no dialogue be appealing? Why would watching a 10 year old girl torture and kill a cat (they don't really kill the cat) who then eats a handful of rat poison to kill herself sound like something worth sitting through? Or how about two military clerks, one dictating and the other typing up doctored notes on the people we just spent 7 hours watching and forming our own opinion of? How about a long shot of an owl? Or horses running around a village square? Rain? Endless rain scene after soaking scene? What's the point?

Well the point it to make you feel terrible the way The Princess Bride makes you feel wonderful. This is THE anti-film. It flies in the face of everything you're supposed to do with a film. 10 minutes of a blind man banging a hand-bell and yelling 'The Turks Are Invading?' is not exactly ripping drama. In fact almost everyone would call it pretentious.

But that's the point. The film is about that feeling of dread we all have sometimes about the world, ourselves, and each other. And just because these are unpleasant emotions does not mean they are unworthy of exploration because, after all, ignoring them will not make them go away.

And the film is a bout a lot more than just soul-crushing depression and a vague sense that the world is either ending or that we're all being watched by a government or God that really just hates us. The film is about oppression and manipulation and how people who are the most vulnerable can be controlled and taken advantage of by even the flimsiest threats of violence or judgment. In that was this is a political film, but from a part of the world that has suffered under so much corruption, ineptitude, oppression, and graft, that it seems, to us, to almost be unreal. Do people actually live like this? Can things really be THIS bad?

Yes. Yes they can be. And it's all unpleasant. Nobody likes to be told they are free but then realize the best they can hope for is to wander around from meal to meal, drink to drink, and bed to bed, and hope nobody will make off with your paycheck. Nobody likes to be shown they are, in fact, not free at all and that the world really just doesn't work and that nobody knows what they're doing except for when they're taking advantage of you.

This is the sort of film most people should see but never will because it's depressing. Nobody wants this. Nobody wants to be made to feel bad. But isn't that just lying to yourself? How can you know (Satan) is taking advantage of you if you don't know what it means to be taken advantage of? How do we spot oppression and corruption and fear and cruelty before it becomes systemic and it's too late to do anything about it? If we all wishing for the sun in a land that only ever rains, then how do we resist the ""promise"" of a warmth that doesn't exist?",1406592000,8,4227,4.410256410256411
