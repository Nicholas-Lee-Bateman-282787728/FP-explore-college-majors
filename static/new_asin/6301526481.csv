7812386,3,6301526481,This was kind of a cheesy movie... the acting is not so great but the story line is better... dealing with a marriage with a pregnant woman and how they deal with their current situation.,1395187200,,187,4.371428571428571

7812388,5,6301526481,This movie is so much more than most people realize. Hank is a concreter (i.e. he lays concrete and repairs concrete structures.) But in this movie the cracks are in his life caused by the stress of impending fatherhood and chronic underemployment. He stumbles through trying to find an easy way to hold it all together but basically making more of a mess of things. Some of his missteps are comic; some are tragic -- many are both. But as the movie progresses we learn along with Hank that it is his pregnant wife Jesse who will seal the cracks in his life and gives hope that Hank will find his way through in the end.,1123545600,6,620,4.353448275862069
7812389,2,6301526481,"There's not a lot to say about this film.  It tries to be a comedy, then it tries to be a 'true-life' style drama, and it never really succeeds at either.  And it has Yeardley Smith, the actress who does the voice of cartoon Lisa Simpson, briefly topless.  The film kept me interested enough to watch the whole thing, but probably not enough to watch it again.",1081296000,5,360,4.343283582089552
