8178581,5,B000N85VLW,"The filipino TV show ""Maalaala Mo Kaya"" has created lots of unforgettable heartbreaking episodes in its 16 years, but I consider PISO the best one EVER made.

Piolo Pascual's portrayal of a math teacher who suffers a mental disease is the best role he EVER played. Many of the characters he played in his movies don't differ much from each other (though they're still very entertaining), but here in the role of Mel he showed us for the first time what a truly great actor he is.

But I must not forget Jodi Santamaria and Susan Africa who did extraordinary performances on that episode.

The second episode SWING with Judy Ann Santos (without any doubt the best actress in the Philippines) and Jason Abalos has almost the same effect on me as PISO. Here we see a young woman who's diagnosed with brain cancer bumping into a callboy. Judy Ann is absolutely awesome, like always (all of her 6 MMK appearances are simply brilliant). What i really love about this episode and MMK in general is that these sad stories have some happy moments as well. And that's exactly what's making them so real.

It's absolutely heartbreaking when you see a person getting ill and then watch her condition getting worser. Hollywood wouldn't show us the real suffering of that person. But Maalaala Mo Kaya does and I'm thankful for that cos only the hard real life could make me cry.

I watched this DVD dozens of times (and will always watch it again and again) and tears are always the result I get from it. Don't get me wrong. I am NOT one easy to cry. For example, I will never shed any tear for any dramatic hollywood flick. Cos to me these movies are not real. But Maalaala Mo Kaya IS!!! All the tales of MMK are based on true filipino stories. The directors of the series are absolutely faithful to the original story. And that's why it's working so well.

Director Jerry Lopez Sinening is a real genius (don't forget to catch his other MMK episodes like ROSARYO, which is out on DVD now).

PISO and SWING are masterpieces!!! This is the best DVD of all time! Period!",1181433600,2,2055,4.522911051212938
