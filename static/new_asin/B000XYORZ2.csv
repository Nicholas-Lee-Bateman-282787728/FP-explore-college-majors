8230259,5,B000XYORZ2,"I loved this video! I watched it with my 6 yr.old. It was a refreshing break from the frenetic world of children's entertainment. The series is a creative and accessible interpretation of classic literature done with traditional puppetry and beautiful music. My daughter was engaged throughout. If your child is used to tons of fast editing, and high drama they may find this too slow - might be best for the 2-5 yr old crowd. But, I say try it - your child might just surprise you with staying engaged with something so pleasant and Disney free.",1258502400,,546,4.639175257731959
