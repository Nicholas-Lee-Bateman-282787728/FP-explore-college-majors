6256491,5,B00IBKXRX8,"Hard workout, but you can choose the components that work best for you.  It's great the way she tells you the next move coming up so you're not always trying to catch up to the moves on the screen.  Many of the moves build, meaning you start with something that doesn't seem to hard, and then she adds a ""bit of a challenge"".  If you can do it you feel so proud, rather than some DVDs that make you feel like the one that always got picked last for dodge ball in gym class. Also great to have the countdown timer on the screen the whole time!",1408060800,4,542,4.046728971962617
