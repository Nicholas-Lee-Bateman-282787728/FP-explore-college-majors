4255916,5,B0043LUR6E,"Sometimes the stars align and a cast and crew is lucky enough to produce a season of television that is pretty much flawless. The third season of ""Friday Night Lights."" The fifth season of ""The X-Files."" The second season of ""Gilmore Girls."" But normally these seasons of perfection come only after a show has slowly built itself into something great after making a few missteps.

From the opening moments of its pilot to the closing seconds of the twenty-third episode of its first season, ""The Good Wife"" was flawless.

Part of its elegance comes from the fact that it refuses to define itself, easily veering between lawyer procedural, family drama, conspiracy thriller and romantic drama throughout the year, often over the course of one episode. The shocking thing is that each of the above is just as well-handled as the others, and it is a delight to watch the ensemble juggle the storylines. More than that, each storyline is meticulously layered unlike any other drama of (dare I say) the past decade. Here the viewer feels mixed feelings with every new twist and turn. Like life, nothing on this show (except the main titles) is black and white and every happiness comes with a few notable reservations.

The large cast is diverse and obscenely talented. Part of the joy of watching ""The Good Wife"" is watching the worlds of the shows briefly intertwine with one another and seeing characters you know well but would never expect to share the screen together feel one another out. From Archie Panjabi's smart-but-labyrinthine investigator to Alan Cumming's oily, brilliant publicist (the show is also notable as being first time I haven't wanted to reach through the screen and strangle Cumming), there isn't a weak link in the bunch.

And then, of course, we have Julianna Margulies in the performance of her career. No other actress can say so much while speaking so little and her fantastic, multi-layered performance already has me ranking Alicia next to Lorelai Gilmore and Buffy Summers in terms of my favorite heroines of all time.

The show is a major hit for CBS, but not many of my friends are watching. Perhaps it is because, on the surface, it seems to be nothing more than another glossy procedural. What a damn shame.

The fact that ""The Good Wife"" can be this consistently good in its first season is unheard of. It is the best show of the 2009-2010 season and has done in one season what most shows cannot in their entire runs. And the best part? The journey has just started.",1278374400,10,2502,4.780092592592593

4255918,5,B0043LUR6E,"I realize this is an incredible show, but I really have to ask why it takes them so long to issue it on CDs. They already have the show on tape. They know they`re going to release CDs as soon as they see the ratings. Are they competely incompetent? September?? What kind of joke is that?",1277769600,,287,4.142857142857143
4255919,5,B0043LUR6E,"Never was a phrase, ""torn from the headlines,"" more appropriate for a TV show. This dramatic tale of a wronged politician's wife brings instantly to mind famous couples such as Bill and Hillary Clinton, John and Elizabeth Edwards, Darlene and John Ensign, Jenny and Mark Sanford, and David and Wendy Vitter. But the circumstances that most closely resemble those used in ""The Good Wife"" are those of Silda and Eliot Spitzer. In 2008, Spitzer resigned as governor of New York after it was revealed that he had spent public funds on high-priced call girls. In his case, his resignation halted potential prosecution. Not so for Peter Florrick (Chris Noth, best known as Mr. Big, Carrie's lover in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City/dp/B00004RFCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City</a>). In ""The Good Wife,"" the husband of the titular ""good wife,"" resigns as the state's attorney of Cook County, in the Chicago area of Illinois, after he's exposed for the same crime as Spitzer. But his successor gets Peter thrown in jail.

The series' opening scene involves Peter's wife, Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ER/dp/B00005JLFT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ER</a>), nobly, and humiliatingly, backing up Peter as he announces to the press he is resigning. Then the scene switches to six months in the future. Peter is in jail. Alicia has been forced to downsize from a big house to an apartment, and she's looking for a job. For her entire marriage, Alicia has sacrificed her education and professional talents in favor of supporting her husband's political career and caring for their two children, now young teenagers. But with Peter's needs now moot, and his income gone, it's time to dust off her law degree and seek a paid position.

Though she is forty-something and out of touch with the legal world, Alicia manages to use one of her own connections to snag a position as a junior associate at the firm of a friend from law school, Will Gardner (Josh Charles, best known for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sports-Night/dp/B001B187BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sports Night</a>). But the job has two major drawbacks. First, Will sees her as the one that got away, and Alicia is in no mood for that kind of complication. And, second, the job is not secure. She is in competition with another new junior associate, Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry, Rory's college boyfriend in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmore-Girls/dp/B000U0F7RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmore Girls</a>), who is the very definition of a whiz kid. Worse, though Cary is extremely competitive, Alicia is naturally collegial and kind, and it goes totally against the grain for her to try and cut anyone out.

I was sold on this show from the opening scene of the pilot. Every actor in it is great, but the three main female actors are particular standouts. First and foremost, Margulies is wonderful. In fact, one might say she was made for this part. It requires some of the most difficult skills an actor can have, in my humble opinion, to subtly indicate a whole range of emotion on the face of a character who is dignified and reserved by nature. Margulies manages to accomplish this with astounding ease given the limitations of her character's personality. It would have been out of character, for example, for Alicia to employ standard ""bits of business"" that other actors use such as grabbing or shoving to show anger. Instead, she shows subtle nuances of expression. Most of all, Margulies reveals Alicia to us by displaying in every scene perhaps Alicia's most sterling virtue, a quiet empathy which connects her to and draws out every other character she comes in contact with. This quality coupled with keen observation and a brilliant, analytical mind are the main attributes that allow Alicia to not only succeed as a trial attorney but to solve mysteries surrounding the cases she takes on--allowing this series to be a fascinating combination of mystery, political, legal and relationship drama, all rolled into one. Most of all, Margulies's talent as an actor allows the audience to understand and believe in every choice that Alicia makes, no matter how difficult, from the loyalty she displays to the unfaithful husband she obviously has loved deeply for many years, to her firm but affectionate relationship with her children, to her tactful handling of her meddling mother-in-law, to her often morally ambiguous encounters with her co-workers and her clients.

The second amazing woman in this series is the ever marvelous Christine Baranski (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia/dp/B001GKJ2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia!</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cybill/dp/B00140PK8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cybill</a>) as Diane Lockhart, a co-partner with Alicia's boss Will. It does not surprise me that a comic actor as phenomenal as Baranski is also an outstanding dramatic actor. Most actors seem to agree that doing comedy is so difficult that drama seems comparatively easy. In this series, Baranski's character Diane has a complex relationship with Alicia and has plenty of juicy plot lines of her own.

The third female actor whose performance I greatly admire is Archie Panjaba (the heroine's older sister in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-It-Like-Beckham/dp/B00005JM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend It Like Beckham</a>), who plays the enigmatic Kalinda Sharma. Kalinda rather rapidly develops what seems to be a strong friendship with Alicia, demonstrating an amazing amount of helpfulness and loyalty to her. But Kalinda's background and true intentions toward Alicia remain intriguingly unclear throughout the whole first season.

Among the male actors, my personal favorite is the fabulously versatile Scottish actor Alan Cumming (Glitch the Scarecrow in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tin-Man/dp/B0010X744G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tin Man</a>&nbsp;and Nightcrawler in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B001PPGAKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>). He plays Peter's cunning political adviser, Eli Gold, and this role is the dead opposite of the odd, quirky types he's most famous for. Eli is conservative and muted, almost benignly invisible in his presentation to the general public. But underneath he seethes with passion and is a powerful, back-room player in the world of politics. His relationship with Alicia is one of the most dynamic in the series and his role in one of the key decisions she makes at the climax of season 1 is absolutely pitch perfect. And, by the way, his American accent is perfect.

I personally adore dramas that present the protagonist with moral dilemmas every week that are filled with shades of gray. This series abounds in that dynamic. I also much prefer dramas that have two clear story tracks, the protagonist's professional life (in this series a weekly legal case for Alicia to pursue, with a frequent mystery thrown into the mix as I mentioned above), and the protagonist's personal life. Because of Peter's scandal, there are plenty of juicy sinkholes for Alicia to inadvertently step into as she weaves her way through a landscape of seemingly endless people who want to use her or abuse her because of her connection to her husband. This thread in the series has allowed it to avoid falling into the aggravating pattern of so many dramatic TV series of melodramatic emphasis on the personal failings of the protagonist and her close family members in ways that often turn that protagonist from sympathetic to pathetic and annoying. I am greatly hoping this series continues to avoid that pitfall for many years to come.",1277510400,313,8045,5.853367433930094
4255920,5,B0043LUR6E,"""The Good Wife"" ranks at the very top, in the cream of the cream, of the best television series ever created. Such a strong statement needs verification. Just what makes this weekly series so powerful?

1. Julianne Margulies, foremost, plays the ""good wife"" in perfect pitch. The wife wronged by her successful, ambitious, attractive, but absolutely corrupt husband (the gorgeous Chris Noth) as a fallen, disreputable district attorney, you know, the kind voters love to put back into office. Then there's the sex scandal that horribly embarrasses both his ""good wife"" and children? What is her reaction to his scandal? How does she cope?

2. Her education as an attorney, no, not just an attorney, but an insightful, resourceful, brilliant attorney, not only gets her a job quickly, but proves she deserves it.

3. Kalinda, the private investigator is the biggest mystery on the show. Just whose side is she on? Just whom has she been intimate with? She represents the ultimate pragmatist, the bottom-liner. She gets my vote as the most mysterious and intriguing of all the characters!

4. Add the mother-in-law, who is helping out while son tries to get out of jail. Viewers eventually discover that she is one of those controlling mothers who push their children onto the success track at any cost.

5. One strand involves the growing attraction between Margulies and her male boss whom she knew in college.  Although not the gorgeous, virile type (like her husband), he represents the intelligent, successful, but perpetual bachelor, one to be wary of.

6. Which also includes office politics and two more fascinating characters: the driven woman partner (whose own love interest is one of the pings later described) and the young male attorney also vying for the one slot that both the Margulies character and he fiercely want.

6. Another Subplot involves her son and a cougar-like older girl intent on using the boy for her own devious plans.

Now wrap all this back story into the various strands that it takes to create a tightly woven plot, utterly fascinating, utterly unpredictable. Ping! What?! Yes, something came loose. What is it? Something that makes this series so gripping, so unexpected, so dramatic that viewers are on the edge of their seats, expectant, breathless. Frankly, I've been stunned any number of times.

Addition: Two days after publishing this review, I realized I had covered only one-half of the program. The personal lives of the characters make up one-half, the other half concerns the weekly trial (after all, this is partially a courtroom drama). Each case is unique and equally fascinating. Just as in real life, each case is not necessarily resolved for the viewer's total satisfaction. Sometimes the viewer--and the attorney--don't really know if the client is truly innocent. This holding to what actually happens also makes this series a winner--provocative, perspicacious, gripping. Verisimilitude is practiced here.

""The Good Wife"" is what television should be about: quality of the highest order. This is not a series a viewer can simply tune into with the mistaken notion of joining the story. It's too complicated, too nuanced for such a cavalier attitude. That's what makes ""The Good Wife: The First Season"" so essential--it provides a full appreciation of this excellent and outstanding drama! Frankly, my viewing mode is in idle for the summer, barely containing a great desire to discover what in the world will happen next!",1277510400,141,3479,5.0966608084358525
4255921,5,B0043LUR6E,"Margolis gives a fascinating, very sympathetic performance as a smart, accomplished woman, a more-than-competent lawyer, loving mother, accomodating daughter-in-law, and betrayed but tenuously hopeful wife. She is a model of self-restraint, self-respect, and compassion.  You cannot help but watch her face every second she is on the screen. Noth is the ambitious, attractive, self-indulgent, man-of-the-people politician who wants to come back home after a very public number of sexual and possibly ethical missteps have landed him in jail and alienated his family.  More than that, he desperately wants to regain the trust and love of all the people he betrayed. The writing is superb!  I can't wait to see what will happen every Tuesday.  The private investigator is indeed a riveting character:  whose side is she on?  has SHE had her own affair with Noth?  is she loyal to the good wife? what's up with those 6 inch heeled thigh high leather boots?  The only problem I've had with the show is the frequent mid-season replays. But if this helps them keep up their excellent writing, I'll be patient. If you couldn't already tell, I highly recommend this!",1271980800,31,1158,5.122340425531915
4255922,5,B0043LUR6E,"Update in late August 2010: It was just announced that Michael J. Fox is coming aboard for some episodes of this show's second season to play an attorney.  He recently won an Emmy for doing the same on RESCUE ME.  I am very excited about this as I think he will be a very good foil for these characters.  My original review follows.

This show never ignores its central premise: what is it like being the wife of one of these political figures who gets involved in a lurid sex scandal.  Julia Marguiles does a very good job answering that question week in and week out.  Chris Noth plays her sex scandal husband.  Some viewers know him from SEX AND THE CITY while others know him from LAW & ORDER shows, both the original and CRIMINAL INTENT. He also does a very good job because you never like or trust him.  His role is getting meatier as the weeks go on and that is all to the good. I frankly would be tempted to just dump him in her place but she holds on for a variety of reasons, the most compelling being her two teen children who are already deeply conflicted by their father's behavior.  He starts out the season in prison and the action steps up when he is allowed to come home under house arrest, with an ankle bracelet. She is left as the main wage earner and she is a very good attorney in her own right. At her firm, she is surrounded by a partner, who is clearly smitten by her, another partner who is the reigning superwoman, and a woman private investigator for the firm, who is fast becoming one of the breakout stars from the series. I think this show is well worth your giving it a try.

4255928,5,B0043LUR6E,"""The Good Wife"" is a CBS legal and family drama, which examines the travails and tribulations of a middle-age woman whose entire life is upended by the scandalous and criminal behavior of her husband, which has landed him in prison, and unable to care for his family. She is a law school graduate who has not practiced law for many years, after having given up her career to raise her children and manage the household. She re-enters the workforce as a junior associate at a prestigious law firm, and one of the name partners of her new firm is a former law school classmate, who had once been a very close friend. ""The Good Wife"" is an interesting and compelling television program, which is characterized by superb writing, intelligent and thought-provoking story lines, and excellent plot and character development. The acting is first-rate, with stellar performances by the ensemble cast, which includes Julianna Margulies, Chris Noth, Christine Baranski, Josh Charles, Matt Czuchry, Zach Grenier, Archie Panjabi, Alan Cumming, Makenzie Vega, and Graham Phillips, to name a few.

4255942,1,B0043LUR6E,"Overall, not a bad show but I'm giving the low rating for two reasons: 1, Alicia's character can be so assertive in the most complex of situations, but then suddenly she gets railroaded by the most mundane things and acts like her world is completely out of control. This happened throughout the series, not just in any one season and it was pretty aggravating to watch and think this was true to her character. 2, The biggest reason for the low rating is the series finale. Literally nothing was answered, for better or worse. Maybe this is considered creative and ""original"" by some, but really what effort did it take in the writing department to come with an ending that had no end?? If I had known that in the beginning, I would have never started watching this show. The finale made me immediately think about how much time I had wasted...",1490659200,2,845,4.565789473684211

I assumed it would be a show about this wife Alicia dealing with her husband's very public crime and infidelity, but it's mostly another one of those attorney dramas that throws legal procedure out the window. She is supposedly a ""junior associate"" competing for a spot in a prestigious law firm, but she shows up to work last, has time for chit-chat, and she is in trial every day. She is constantly hanging out with the partners, and put on as lead attorney for all the high profile cases. She should be buried in paperwork, but she is mostly in court (arriving last!) and out doing investigations with the firm's own PI, who apparently only works for Alicia. They constantly have an easy time finding very damning evidence, that they randomly throw out in court in the middle of a witness cross-exam. After a couple episodes Julianna Margulies goes from great acting, to making the same face all the time and looking bored with her own life. I can't figure out why they bother having a ""previously on the Good Wife"" at the beginning, since nothing in the series has progressed from the first episode.",1489708800,6,1188,4.6084905660377355

We are introduced to the amazing cast, Julianne Margolis is the Good Wife, Chris Noth is the Bad Husband, and this first season is about the marriage, does it break up, what does the Good Wife do, how does the family react, and what about that mother-in-law?

When the Good Wife started there had been a rash of good wives of politicians whose husbands had done them wrong. What a wonderful opportunity for a series. However. As the series moves along, we find Alicia Florrick as the Good Wife. Will she forgive her husband, Peter, as he Enters jail for corruption charges? As the States Attorney for Cook County will this end his career?

And, as the series follows Alicia, what happens to the Good Wife after the scandal wears down? How does the family move on, we discover all of this in season one. A remarkable cast and an excellent first season. Kudos reign for all.

4256168,4,B0043LUR6E,"My mom was addicted to this show when it aired but I never got into. I got bored and saw it on amazon prime so decided to try it out.

The characters do not seem a ton developed. It feels like we are only seeing the surface of the characters. This might be because it was for tv or the writers were trying to show the cases off more than the characters. I would love to have seen more emotions from Alica. You can kinda see some since she is trying to handle so many things at once but at the same time it is like she is trying to push her feelings down to do the job.

The plot is pretty good. When it comes to the cases and the law parts I have no idea if this is close to real or not. I feel the decisions made and the things that are done do seem real. There is no real like cheesy parts. It all feels real. The politics seem real though from what I have seen of the ""real world"" there seems to be more politics in the office than what they are showing. From what I've seen of season two this is shown more. I also feel even with her connection to one of the bosses and her last name that she still wouldn't be on all the big cases but on smaller ones or lesser chair than she is.

I would love to see more of Alicia's past and more of the rest of the characters stories. Though with the way the series is now it is still nice entertainment.",1483920000,2,1345,3.8659420289855073

4256231,5,B0043LUR6E,"Well-written, female-driven drama. The only downside is, like most of these shows, the writers seem to be mostly men or patriarchal-centered females. This means you'll see women getting walked over or inviting themselves to be walked over, men seducing women who say no but who can resist male aggression. I cringe when I see scenes like this, but the cast is strong and acting good. Stories good too",1483056000,,400,4.897058823529412

After only a few episodes, I decided to watch the first season to understand what was going on and see if I still liked the show.  I would have guessed that a lawyer drama would be something I was interested in, previous ones bored me, but the way this show is written and arranged, I enjoy this as one of my favorites!  I used to watch Juliana Margulies in ER, so I was not terribly surprised by her performance, but the rest of the cast also do an excellent job.  The writing is believable and not cheesy, funny, and leaves you coming back for more.  I was a little disappointed that the series ended right about when I started watching it, but that's what these DVDs are for!

4256358,5,B0043LUR6E,"Great viewing.  One has to suspend some logic to go along with the legal goings on... but otherwise it's a great series and one I find addictive.  The characters are very engaging and the acting is terrific.  Multi dimensional so there's lots to keep up interest, there's the tension between the main character and her high profile philandering husband, mother in law, old love interest and teenage kids...whew.  On top of that, she is now the breadwinner and has reentered the work force as a junior associate at a law firm where her old flame is a partner.  Lots of interesting cases and colleagues.",1481241600,,601,4.740384615384615

But overall, I still give it a high rating. It's got something of a Law & Order feel, but I enjoy it more than L&O. Also, absolutely love the title character, Alicia Florrick. And love how Margulies portrays her. Love Archie Panjabi as Kalinda. I'm a sucker for a strong female lead, I guess.

4257005,5,B0043LUR6E,"I have loved every episode of The Good Wife, Season 1.  It has an excellent script and wonderful actors/actresses which play their roles admirably. Parallel to the protagonists' own drama,  diverse and very interesting criminal and civil actions run their course, and as an attorney myself I truly enjoy the courtroom scenes where  the judges', prosecutors and defense attorneys dynamics are presented, although, of course, one has to admit to a little bit of fiction to add to the suspense.  The viewer also gains an insight into the world of politics and politicians, leaving one to wonder how much of it happens in real life.  Romance, family issues, interesting and  diverse character personalities add also to the merits of this season.  Hopefully, the next seasons will be as interesting and enjoyable to watch.",1472774400,,817,5.097744360902255

It's well acted, smart, well-written. Impressed that it's regular TV. I like how it's more pro woman than a lot of stuff I see. I lik the characters. And even though the endings are generally positive it does not feel Pollyanna-like. I also like tha she is not super young. I like how it's jot gruesome, or edgy. I do enjoy edgy but for example Blacklist. There's a show that after a few episodes it was predictable, acting declined, female roles bad and women were the violent victims almost always. Atypically, I binge watched 5 episodes last night! I'm still in the first season, but give it a big thumbs up. Psyched there are a lot of seasons ahead of me!",1472428800,,803,4.4324324324324325

4257131,5,B0043LUR6E,"I love this show.  Not only does it create depth for the trope of the put-upon wife in Alicia Florrick, but it actually does explore the depths of her roiling feelings as she deals with the pain involved in raising children in the shadow of scandal, picking up the pieces of a career she let be shattered by her husband's over-shadowing ambition, her own romantic story, her own self-delusion, and the ultimate betrayal by her family.  It also allows an avenue to redemption for a character so aptly portraying one of the most deeply troubled tropes - the despicably straying husband.  The legal aspect of the show is sound in a way that not many other shows are capable of handling both accurately and entertainingly.  Well done!",1471392000,,730,4.724409448818897

4257256,4,B0043LUR6E,I watched this show when it first came out but only the first season. I'm now on season 5. It's a great show. Especially if you like criminal justice type shows. It even makes you question the justice system at times; leaves you with food for thought.,1470700800,,251,4.361702127659575
4257257,4,B0043LUR6E,I'm only about 3/4 of the way through the first season but so far it's very good. It's a show that my husband and I can watch together. It's a mix of House of Cards and Law and Order. We are enjoying it!,1470700800,,203,3.744186046511628

Having seen about half of the first season, I'm glad to have watched it.  I recognize many of the seasoned actors and actresses as professionals I've seen in other series, and this makes it so easy for me to stay engaged.  I've been a fan of legal dramas and suspense.  This doesn't have language or nudity issues, which I appreciate.  Very nicely done especially for me because I've been a long time fan of ER, Law and Order, Bosch, The Americans, and others.",1470009600,,597,4.481481481481482

4257304,5,B0043LUR6E,"FANTASTIC!!  I viewed all seasons of The Good Wife and could barely pull myself away.  Superb actors and acting.  I think people praised the writing (by husband and wife team) as being much more mature and better quality than typical TV fare.  Each season of The Good Wife had about 22 episodes, and typical TV shows have 13 or 14, so this series has added value to have so many episodes that were made for each of 7 seasons of the show.
The actors are all brilliant and do such fantastic characters.  This is drama and it is nice to see drama done well.  I love this show and will continue to re-view episodes until I feel bored.",1469923200,,630,4.296610169491525

By lying, cheating, and throwing morals away. From the wife to the kids and the mother they display no sense of goodness, just in protecting the father because their only desire is to remain rich, spoiled and uncaring.

Still, I do like good lawyer dramas so I will still give it four stars.",1520726400,,464,4.634146341463414
