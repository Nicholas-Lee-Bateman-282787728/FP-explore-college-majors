5677698,4,B00BVJJSMA,Not a 5 because there was a brief spot on the first dvd that skipped and I could not get it to change. The rest was fine and the tv series excellent.,1375747200,,149,3.6875

5677701,5,B00BVJJSMA,"I was so desperate for Season 2.  I just purchased this DVD set hoping it would have English subtitles and would play in Australia.  Yes to both I am so happy.  Season 2 is a little more intriguing with some unexpected twists, but still brilliant.  And my parcel arrived a lot sooner than I expected.",1372204800,8,300,4.4
5677702,5,B00BVJJSMA,"i've watched both seasons of the american homeland, which I have really liked.  this is the original tv show, which was an Israeli production with Israeli actors, language and shot there. the premise is the same.  there were israeli soldiers captured by the enemy.  they were held as POWs for 17 years. two come home alive and the third comes home in a coffin. however, the true focus of the series is the reintegration with their families with the two and with the third accepting the death. i found this very riveting stuff but if you are looking for a spy counterspy series, which the american version definitely is, this original version does explore that aspect but it is secondary to the domestic scenes.  the spy counterspy aspect picks up in season two with an unexpected discovery made at the end of season one. this discovery does lead to a military operation.  even with this aspect though, the domestic scenes are just as solid in season two.

i think this is the more realistic of the two series but there is no denying the one two punch that the american show delivers for fans of spy series.  i think you can enjoy both versions equally.  I certainly did.

5677703,5,B00BVJJSMA,"Though not a mega production like it's american  couterpart ""prisoners of war"", the original version is much more
subtle and deals with the human beings (prisoners, their families and friends) rather than with ""action"". Beautifully acted, still manages to bring some suspense, especially in season 2 and is definitely worth seing. Unless you get bored if there is no shooting every 10 seconds. But for the shooting, watching the news should be enough, in the US.
A must see, spoken in arabic and hebrew, but good englisg subtitles.",1368316800,25,531,5.034090909090909
5677704,5,B00BVJJSMA,"I was so happy to find this on Amazon.  I had already watched Season 1 but could not find Season 2 by itself only Season 1 & 2 combined.  However, this did not matter as I now have the whole set of DVDs. It is an incredibly well-produced series with superb acting.  I have recommended it to friends.  I was a big fan of Homeland but must say that Prisoners of War is superior.  The story takes a little while to get into as scenes switch from present to past but very soon it all makes sense.  There are some unexpected twists to the story.  I could have watched the entire twenty-four episodes in one go if I had had the time.  Brilliant!

Janet",1394668800,,646,4.145161290322581
5677705,5,B00BVJJSMA,Better than Homeland.  Kidnapped delivers more emotion and sympathy. You will develop empathy for the families as well as the victims and it has thrilling endings in both seasons.,1393200000,,179,5.172413793103448
5677706,5,B00BVJJSMA,"DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS.  STORY LINE IS GREAT CASTING AND ACTING SUPER.
I DON't KNOW HEBREW BUT THE SUBTILES WAS VERY GOOD.",1392249600,2,132,4.5
5677707,4,B00BVJJSMA,"This is the Israeli original to the Showtime's hit Homeland, which I am obsessed with. But this is actually very different. I would imagine that it is as relevant and as topical to Israeli viewers as homeland is to us. It is about three Israeli prisoners of war. Two make it back alive one supposedly dead, I'll say no more. In flashback we see the brutal,barbaric treatment they suffered at the hands of a Muslim extremist sect. But the series does not pull any punches with the Israeli government who hold the two survivors for a strenuous de-briefing in the interest of national security. The series first season elaborates on the two men's deep intimate bond, they are as close to each other as two heterosexual men can be. They have joined again a society that has idolized them or even moved on in some cases. This is a deep and compelling study of the characters as well as of life in modern Israel. The government's suspicion's do turn out to be valid the men are hiding secrets and they slowly come to light. This set includes series one and two, I have only watched the first and I am hooked.",1390348800,8,1102,4.487562189054726
5677708,5,B00BVJJSMA,"Twelve stars would just about make it.
NO! Make that 15 Stars.
After a rocky start where in everything went swimingly, a bad disc brought the tension of this wonderful production to a halt.
The vendor was not particularly helpful and happily Amazon's A-Z program and great ccustomer service supplied a refund which enabled me to re-order from ""TecNick in the UK"".  (BE WARY OF THE ISRAELI VENDORS, CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT THEIR MIDDLE NAME) We finished watching this amazing, excellently directed, beautifly written and surpurbly acted progran to it's conclusion. Unless you are fluent in Ivrit(Hebrew) you will NEED the Anglit (English) sub-titles.
Do NOT let that scare you off. Everything, EVERYTHING about this series is absoslutely top notch.
This is better and well ahead of the palid American version of this series, i.e., Homeland.
Do yourself a favor and watch this show. Well worth your money and time.",1389744000,3,912,5.08
5677709,4,B00BVJJSMA,Kept me on the edge of my seat. Plot and story-line were great. DVD takes a little work to get into US subtitles. Not zoned for US- watched on my laptop,1387756800,,152,3.935483870967742
5677710,5,B00BVJJSMA,"An excellent series. Certainly many twists and turns that keep you involved with all the characters.
Far better & more exciting than the American version of Homeland.",1384387200,,166,5.185185185185185

8574518,5,B00BVJJSMA,A must seen movie series which inspired the production of Homaland series.,1417910400,,74,5.25
8574519,1,B00BVJJSMA,"Good story, much better then Homeland. A little slow at the beginning and too much torture on screen though.

BIG problem is that we have just found out (over 3 months after buying the box), that the very last DVD (last two episodes of season #2) is damaged and cannot be read on any DVD player. It is too late to send it back.

And the last episodes are neither on iTunes nor on Amazon Prime. Very frustrating...",1415923200,,413,4.282051282051282

8574524,4,B00BVJJSMA,"Much better than the ""Homeland"" remake...",1404345600,,41,6.0
8574525,5,B00BVJJSMA,"Although we have not finished viewing the entire series, I think that I can comment on the mastery of the dramatic and cinematic art shown by the creators of this brilliant, disturbing, and tense drama. There's not a wasted scene. The conflicts between and among the characters builds without relief. Although the scenes in captivity shock the viewer, they are not gratuitous. One senses at the beginning that many lives were ruined. Since we have only seen several chapters and don't know how any of this will resolve, these comments could be revised later; but, no one is spared  suffering. The directors, writers, and actors convey the latter in a way which one rarely sees in TV series. An unobtrusive musical score adds to the drama.
A word about the edition: It has not been made for the international market. Even though the quality of the recording is excellent, the menus are in Hebrew and there's a bit of difficulty finding one's way.",1404000000,6,945,4.7975460122699385
