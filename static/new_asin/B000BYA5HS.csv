2446906,3,B000BYA5HS,"If you're fascinated with revenge flicks like CARRIE or WILLARD, then TAMARA is an okay entry in this genre.  Jenna Dewan plays both the mousy outcast and the suddenly sexy siren who wreaks revenge on the group that humiliated and eventually killed her.  Dewan has a nice foxy demeanor and she uses it well, and the rest of the twenty somethings who play teenagers also fit the bill.  Matthew Marsden adds some nice maturity as the English teacher who is the desire of the lonely Tamara.  It's all a little gory and preposterous, but it has style and it's entertaining, and with the recent horde of horrible horror movies, it's a good break!",1150070400,2,641,4.646017699115045
2446907,3,B000BYA5HS,"The story starts off pretty much like any 80's horror film, where a group of dumb highschool kids decide to play a prank on the oucast,only to have it end in death. See our lead is quiet girl who chooses to do her work rather than drink and party, but she gets the attention of a couple jocks when she posts a report of enhance-performing drug-use amongst the team in the school paper. This naturally  leads them to come up with this insane scheme to publicly humiliate her. After discovering her attraction to a male teacher, the punks decide to pretend that the teach wants to meet her in a motel room, all-the-while they'll have a camera recording her undressing and making a fool of herself. The jig is up when one of em busts out of the bathroom and surprises her with the camera, causing her to frantically run outside, and in a fit of rage, to the next room, where the group of teens are hiding. She attempts to fight them, but instead hits her head  on the table,which ultimately kills her--at least, so they thought. After burying her body , they make a pact to not tell anyoneabout it. Luckily for them, she strolls into class the next day a new woman -- short skirt and all. It turns out the night before, she attepted touse her witchcraft to create a love spell in hopes of getting her teacher's affection; hence, why she was so enthused when he supposedly calls out of the blue wanting to meet her in a motel. Apparently the spell causes her to return from the dead because she is now bound  to the teacher and not even death can stop them from being togethor. The only remotely original thing this movie offers is the fact that Tamara can control anyone she touches. This leads to interesting deaths for our group and anyone else who stands in her way. Although the deaths are interesting, I felt like the film was holding back its potential of being a solid horror entry. Maybe I was just expecting more gore, or more on screen action-- like in one sequence someone cuts their ear,tongue, and stabs themself in the eye. A sequence like that given with the right make up effects--could have been a sweet watch. Instead we see mostly the person's  hand  and a fair amount of blood. I suppose I was sucked into the hype this movie has been getting. I wanted to like this, but given that it's unoriginal and doesn't offer anything interesting other than the on-screen deaths, I looked towards the potential gore to save itself, but instead we don't even get that. If you were like me expecting a throwback of cheesy 80s gore-flick, then expect to be disappointed as I was. Overall it was unoriginal, but does offer intresting deaths, but sadly, the deaths are the only thing remotely decent about the film. Also do not expect a lot of gore like I did. I recomend checking it out on DVD first but do not expect a lot from it. I would give it a 6 out of 10 if that helps you decide. Ok but not great.",1149120000,2,2909,4.399628252788104

2446909,4,B000BYA5HS,"Tamara is nerdy girl picked on in school. Following her accidental death, she returns from the dead for revenge. Her dabbling in witchcraft granted her the power to make anyone she touched do anything for her. The movie got awesome when she returned. Her first victim was the famous ""hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil"" scene some have mentioned. This guy was probably least responsible for her death than anyone, so you knew it was going to be hell for the others, right??

Well, I would say that was not the case. While some of the death scenes were interesting, some of those most responsible for her death got off with very little suffering. I agree with other reviews that the ending in the hospital was where I got lost. There were a few events that happened during the last 15 minutes that totally made no sense.

The movie takes a unique approach to the old Carrie concept. Some of the scenes were fun to watch and a few of the deaths Tamara brought down on her victims were cool. Although some of those most responsible for her death got off with some pretty weak deaths and the ending was whack, the entertainment was good overall and I think Tamara probably raised the bar for B-movies. If they were all this entertaining, I would have no complaints. Had some of the deaths been better and the ending was worked out to make sense, this one would have been excellent.

Overall, I would say this is a rental and some might want to buy it if you're a junkie for revenge horror films. I would not be surprised to see a Tamara 2 out in the future.",1147737600,2,1559,4.387543252595155
2446910,3,B000BYA5HS,"There is a market out there for B-movie horror films and enough money to be made that we are getting slick productions from Lion Gate Films and others that might not be a scary as we would want, but are certainly not the laughable tripe of days gone by.  ""Tamara"" is the story of an ugly ducking who turn out not only to be a swan, but also a witch (and not a good witch).  So basically we are doing yet another variation of ""Carrie,"" except this time the title figure is about as good looking as she is deadly.  If you remember, Sissy Spacek received an Oscar nomination for playing Carrie White.  That is not going to happen here.

High school student Tamara Riley (Jenna Dewan) is smart, but does not take care of herself or her appearance.  Her mother ran out on her alcoholic father (Chris Sigurdson) years ago.  Tamara has a crush on her teacher, Bill Natolly (Matthew Marsden), who is married to Alison (Claudette Mink) and who appears to be the one person who praises her work.  But she has written an expose on how the jocks are taking performance-enhancing drugs, and they are out for revenge.  Again, the idea is to find a way to humiliate their target, which they manage to do.  Then Tamara accidentally ends up dead, the group decides hushing this up is better than telling the police, and they bury Tamara in the woods.  Tamara was actually an incompetent witch, but being buried with a page with a spell on it turns out to work better than anything she has tried before.  The ""good"" girl of the group is Chloe (Katie Stuart), with her boyfriend, Jesse (Chad Faust).  Shawn (Bryan Clark) is the main bad boy, with Kisah (Melissa Elias) his girl friend and Patrick (Gil Hacohen) his partner in crime.  But none of them get to suffer as much as they deserve, especially given what happens to Roger (Marc DeVigne), the AV geek.

On the plus side, for a low budget movie ($4,750,000 counts as low budget these days), this is a movie that makes you squirm without spending a lot of bucks on special effects.  They get some mileage out of the old adage ""Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil,"" and a simple idea like completely finishing off a bottle of beer can produce results.  I can tell you right now that I ended up rounding up on this film because it had a couple of moments that do a good job of grossing you out, which really does not happen all that often in horror films, especially when we are down to the B level.  Then we can make the blatant understatement that Jenna Dewan cleans up real good when Tamara returns from the grave.  This leads us directly to the downside of the film.

Not all of these kids are evil.  But what they do have in common is that they are all really stupid.  They kill Tamara.  They bury her in the woods.  She comes back looking drop dead gorgeous and instead of immediately needing clean underwear the male idiots in the group look like they are getting turned on.  Even when the first of the guilty group die, alarm bells do not go off for these kids.  They even go so far as to acknowledge that Tamara is up to something, and still they just take a number and wait for their turn to Tamara's ""to do"" list.  Everybody left alive ends up at the hospital for a group variation on the ending of ""Halloween"" and we play out the end game, which does have some turns you might not predict.  The net result is not good, but it is not bad and acceptable B-movie horror schlock for the 21st century.",1147132800,2,3446,4.350547730829421
2446911,3,B000BYA5HS,"Tamara is an occasionally diverting horror film.  The title character (well played by dancer Jenna Dewan) is a shy, nerdy high school student who manages to get on the bad side of the jocks at her school.  Natrually, this leads to the jocks pulling a rather cruel prank on Tarma and, of course, this leads to Tamara accidentally getting killed and buried out in the woods.  However, like all shy, nerdy girls in these types of films, Tamara was into black magic and, the next day, everyone is quite surprised to see Tamara boldly back from the dead, strutting through the school hallways in a high heels and a red bustier.  Not only has returning from the dead given Tamara a new look but it's also left her with a thirst for revenge and the supernatural powers necessary to get it.

The film's plot will be obvious to anyone who has ever seen a horror film and neither director Jeremy Haft or writer Jeffrey Reddick offer up any new twists on a familiar story.  However, the film does occasionally feature some memorable moments.  Though most of the actors sleepwalk through their roles, three actresses do offer up performances that transcend the limitations of their parts.  As Tamara's best friend, Katie Stuart is immensely likeable and believable as a well-meaning teenager who has suddenly found herself in over her head.  Claudette Mink, who plays the unfortunate wife of a teacher that Tamara has a crush on, is good in a relatively thankless role and she brings a real sense of fear to the scenes where she's menaced by Tamara's magic.  She makes those scenes real and, for a few minutes at least, helps the picture rise above the limitations of its plot.  As the title character, Jenna Dewan gives a strong and credible performance.  Her strongest moments are in the beginning of the film when she makes Tamara's loneliness very real and poignant.  Her terror and shame when she discovers that she's been the victim of a cruel prank is never less than believable and it helps to make an awkward scene very credible.  Once she returns from the dead as evil Tamara, she is betrayed by a script that requires her to be almost too campy to be truly threatening but Dewan still manages to believably convey the anger and the need for revenge that lies underneath the surface of someone whose spent their entire life being picked on.

The direction from Jeremy Haft is rather pedestrian for most of the film until the final fifteen minutes or so.  At this point, the survivors of Tamara's revenge find themselves under seige in a small hospital and it is here that the film actually comes alive.  Haft creates a good deal of tension in these scenes and actually makes the fate of some of Tamara's victims rather tragic.  The closing sequence of this film is almost good enough to excuse the rather lame moments that preceded it and it is in these final scenes that Tamara is the most compelling.

In the end, Tamara is a wildly uneven film and probably one that won't be enjoyed by people who aren't fans of horror films.  However, Tamara has just enough promising moments to make it worth taking a chance on.",1145664000,42,3114,4.647810218978102
2446912,5,B000BYA5HS,One of my favorites watched this for the first time back in 2013 and fell in love with it.

Tamara is a girl who doesn't quite fit in, Tamara is constantly picked on and when a couple of friends play a sick joke on her it leads to her death. The friends bury her and try to make it seem that Tamara ran away. But all is not forgotten. Tamara returns as a sexy seductress and plans her revenge. (due to witchcraft)

I personally love this movie, a great horror thriller with an occult underline story, plenty of great entertainment to keep you going, well paced out with plenty of blood and violence and extremely sexy young ladies, lead actress Jenna Dewan is fantastic as Tamara, she certainly turns from quiet nobody into sexy wild child with a killer body, the rest of the cast is great too, Melissa Elias, Katie Stuart, Claudette Mink. Its an all round great revenge movie with a few twists, good effects, good soundtrack, certainly worth adding to any horror collection.

I liked the plot: a bullied girl gets revenge on her tormentors by means of witchcraft. This isn't your typical killer movie. The way she gets revenge is genius. Instead of just straight up killing them, she makes them suffer for a while. Personally, I would call this a suspense movie, not a horror film. It has some intense scenes, but I wasn't really scared. So, if you're looking for a blood filled scary movie, this isn't it. I gave it 4 stars because it starts to drag towards the end and the ending could have been better.

Although the movie is almost the same as Carrie, I found the movie entertaining and somehow funny. The good thing about this movie is the crazy, random things that Tamara(Jenna Dewan) does to her victims, the ones who were involved with her death. They were gory and hilarious. Especially, the part where she made the two masterminds of the setup, Patrick and Shawn, have sex with each other. The bad thing about this movie is the acting. There were plenty of bad acting in this movie. The only good actor was the lead, Jenna Dewan. She did a above average performance as Tamara compare to the rest of the supporting cast.

2446948,3,B000BYA5HS,"Tamara is a nice horror movie but the writing is really strange and often times forgettable due to feeling more like a teen drama than an actual horror.  It's about a teenage girl played by Jenna Dewan who goes to a high school and gets picked on for writing mean articles about the boys sports team.  She has a belligerent alcoholic father and neither the girls or boys at school like her very much.  It's amazing how she morphs from the most unattractive girl in school to the hottest thing I've ever seen!  It must have taken a LOT of makeup to make her look believably unattractive because Jenna Dewan is just so naturally hot!

Eventually the boys come up with a sick prank to lore Tamara (Jenna's character) to a hotel room after tricking her into believing that the teacher she has a crush on is actually willing to sleep with her.  So Tamara gets undressed, gets nice and comfortable under the blankets... and then her classmates storm in and give her the surprise of her life.  One thing leads to another after an altercation and lots of struggling and she soon dies.  Her classmates bury the body in the woods without feeling any compassion whatsoever (due to the weak writing and plot no less) and assume they just got away with murder.  However...

Little do they know Jenna was experimenting with magic before she died.  She's now back from the grave to gradually kill each classmate responsible for her death.  From here the storyline improves but it's nothing earth shatteringly great or anything.  It's more mediocre writing to be honest, since the killings aren't very impressive and the whole movie seems rather tame with a slight adult edge pertaining to the sexual nature of Jenna Dewan.  The very first scene where Jenna's daydreaming she's doing the teacher is a good example.  It feels like the movie writers are placing more emphasis on Jenna's desirable character than on the actual horror and killing segments which hurts the film a little.  It certainly hurts the atmosphere.

Despite that, Tamara has passable writing and pretty good acting.  Perhaps the killings could have been more violent and hard-hitting.  Tamara's definitely a strange film but not necessarily a bad one.  I just barely give it a recommendation.",1414800000,,2246,4.799479166666667

2446958,2,B000BYA5HS,"A line from the movie. This is a high school paranormal revenge movie. The lead character is presumed unattractive because some of her bangs are in the way for a scene or two. Classic She's All That territory. She has an unrequited crush on her teacher, who is the only person who tolerates her bangs and hunched shoulders, apparently. Classmates kill her accidentally and later on she appears in class anyway. This idea is an excellent setup for a very eerie movie. Instead the movie is about a now sexually liberated wicca girl using magical lust powers to enslave various people to do her bidding so she can consummate with her teacher. Watching her read the minds and find the sins of various characters is kind of fun. The stabbing sound effects in this movie sound like someone sticking their hand into mayonnaise. It is used often. The backup characters, including some who felt bad about what happened, are not very well explored. There isn't very much to sustain one's interest unless you have a thing for the lead actress's stale performance, I suppose. While she does trick two guys into making out with one another, nothing more comes of it so there isn't even a fun gay angle to up the novelty value of the film. At one point the teacher says ""This isn't you, it's the magic"". It's that kind of movie. The ending feels pointless.

Overall I'd put this on in the background if you're doing chores or baking goods, but it lacks enough substance to sustain an attentive watching. Two stars.",1413590400,,1500,4.660377358490566

2447002,4,B000BYA5HS,"I give an 'A' for effort for two reasons: 1) while the story idea is not entirely original, there were enough intricacies and differences to make for an entertaining movie and 2) the lead actress was terrific. She starts out as an introverted, repressed target for bullies then, by the end of the movie, she is a dominant powerful force of violent fury...and she pulls it off so well!

As for the overall execution, the pacing was so-so (thus the 'C'). There were parts of the movie that could've been tightened-up, meaning that the scene already made its point but they kind of dragged it out....almost as if the director didn't think the viewer was smart enough to catch it the first time through, so the characters repeat/reiterate the same thing again.

The other facet of average execution was the acting of the supporting cast, especially the two primary male antagonists. I don't know if it is a matter of the rest of the cast being so mediocre or if it was a matter of the lead being so much better, but the disparity between the lead and the supporting cast definitely detracted from an otherwise fun, enjoyable movie.

Despite the pacing and some of the acting, this movie is exactly what one wants (OK, at least me) from a horror movie: some good gore (albeit a little light on this front, too), some good scares, and a good way to spend 90 minutes on a cold, gray afternoon in the midwest.",1260144000,,1401,4.551587301587301

2447010,4,B000BYA5HS,"I actually came across this movie on cable a couple of nights ago,and watched it more out of boredom than anything else,only to be surprisingly entertained. The story revolves around a teenager [played well by newcomer Jenna Dewan] who is a misfit at school, her only motivation being a well-meaning teacher [played by Matthew Marsden], and a kind friend in the form of Chloe [Katie Stuart]. Tamara gets into the bad books of some of the popular kids in school when her expose on doping in athletics is published in the school paper...this sets the scene for a cruel prank that goes horribly awry when Tamara ends up dead and is buried in the woods. The twist here is that Tamara was also a novice witch who dabbled in the black arts, and she returns from the grave as a sexy, malicious vixen hell-bent on exacting her revenge on all who cross her, including some innocents, such as her English teacher upon whom she has a crush, his wife and even Chloe. Though the plot is really nothing new, and has been done in different variations, Jenna Dewan's Tamara is sufficiently convincing and compelling to watch, and the methods she uses to get back at her enemies, though not highly original, nevertheless make for entertaining viewing. ""Tamara"" is not a great horror movie, but it is actually a pretty decent B movie that bears at least one viewing.",1181865600,6,1348,4.668067226890757

2447015,4,B000BYA5HS,"First of all, the movie is very predictable. The story is classic. Tamara is played by Jenna Dewan, and Tamara is a very shy ugly duckling so to speak, who just so happens to practice Witchcraft. Tamara also has a crush on her teacher who is way older, and also married. Tamara makes a huge mistake and exposes the secret that the school jocks have been using steroids, and as a result mandatory drug testing is implemented. Needless to say, this makes them very angry. They then discover Tamara's secret crush and proceed to pull a very cruel prank on her that results in her death. When Tamara's blood is spilled that unknowingly completes a ritual love binding spell that she was casting before that allowing her to rise like The Pheonix from her own ashes. Instead of doing the right thing they decide to cover it up and bury her in the woods like it never happened. The next day, you can imagine the looks of terror on their faces when Tamara shows back up in class looking drop dead sexy, and looking for a little revenge. Tamara possesses the power to make her enemies do her bidding by a single touch, and that's where the fun starts. Now, I usually hate B-Movies, but this one is definitely worth watching. I bypassed this movie at least 20 times in the video store just based on the cover. I thought, yeah right, another teenage slasher film. The teens get caught in the woods having an orgy by the axe welding murderer...PUHLEEZE! I'm glad to see that I was wrong. Frankly, everything about this film was pleasantly surprising. However, it's not for the squeamish, so if the hate the sight of blood, then you may wanna reconsider watching this. I'm not too familiar with Jenna Dewan's past projects, but she played this role pretty convincingly I would say. Katie Suart plays Chloe, and I was familiar with her past projects from the small rolls like ""Titans"" to her larger rolls on ""General Hospital"". Any way, she plays the noble/always wants to do the right thing teen who's just caught up in the middle of the prank with her boyfriend. I think she did a good job as well.

She comes back from the dead unharmed and a super sexy vixen as if nothing happened.

2447019,2,B000BYA5HS,"""Will make even horror buffs flinch!"" ""Tamara will thrill you, turn you on, grab your throat and tear it out!""  These are the boastful blurbs proudly displayed on Tamara's front and back cover.  Normally, I pay little attention to things such as that but I heard similar comments through the grapevine and got a copy of Tamara with great anticipation.

Regrettfully, what I viewed was one of the most predictable and shoddy string of cliches I have ever had the displeasure of watching.  Being a horror collector for well over a decade and owning well past 1000 horror films, I have learned to be tolerant of all manners of cliches and film faults - even embracing many of them.  However, this film is not even enjoyable on that campy level.  You find yourself predicting every shot but secretly hoping you are wrong so you may find some enjoyment in the film.

Now, the back of the box and the other reviewers here have provided very succinct descriptions of the plot so I will not do so.  In its stead, I will offer up a few thoughts and a few questions.  Firstly, the horror films that I have most enjoyed are ones in which I am NOT certain in the first 15 minutes who will live and who will die.  Though the practice can be fun to wager on who will live and die, it does takes a lot away from the film when you are right on every account.  Is it really horror if you are not surprised?  I, and those who watched with me, were not at all shocked nor incorrect.  If you watch the film and have ever seen any film that follows standard Hollywood horror procedure, you will also not fail to predict.  Here are some other thoughts, how many times have you or your loved ones been able to engage in an epic chase through a hospital that was populated when you went in but then all the people just suddenly vanished - nurses, doctors, staff, security, other patients, and all - so that your chase could continue exciting and unimpeded?  Here's a tip: if you choose to use the abandoned hospital set piece, make it abandoned when you get there.  How likely is it that a frazzled and frightened 5'5"" guidance counselor would be able to succesfully disarm and dispatch two 6' something football players who are also wielding knives and not take any collateral damage?  One is almost faintly reminded of the plethora of films where the girl in trouble gains spontaneous knowledge of numerous self-defense techniques.

Those questions aside, Tamara does have some moderately entertaining horror moments but they simply do not live up to the hype.  For example, scroll up and look at the cover again.  See that axe?  She has it in her hands all of about 4 seconds (literally) and it is then thrown to the ground.  So don't think you will see anything involving brutal axe murder or the like.  A man eating a glass bottle and another cutting off his ear (in a less entertaining manner than Resevoir Dogs) and tongue are the highlights of this otherwise dull and half-hearted ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" meets ""Carrie"" 90's style supernatural flick.  Why this got a four-page article in Fangoria, will forever remain a mystery to this horror fan.",1163721600,2,3141,4.548042704626335
2447020,5,B000BYA5HS,"I thought the movie was quite good actually. It starts out as a tale about a young girl who wasn't drop dead gorgeous but wasn't particularly ugly either. Anyway,she isn't popular at all.

Anyway, some of her classmates decide that it will be funny to set her up. They convince her that a teacher who she has a crush on is going to meet with her at an apartment. When she gets there,she finds out that it was a trick.

Anyway, it gets rather interesting from there. If you like pretty girls and if you like pretty and violent girls, this is definitely the movie for you!! I enjoyed it.",1163462400,4,585,4.3090909090909095
2447021,1,B000BYA5HS,"Some kids pull a prank on Tamara and she winds up dead, comes back from the grave all [...]-looking and sporting supernatural powers.  Boredom and lots of lifeless acting ensue.

The acting in this is some of the worst I've seen, and I watch a whole lot of these low budget horror movies.  Nobody has any actual personality whatsoever, they've all got an ""attitude"", and that's pretty much the entire breadth and width of their performances.  I couldn't care less if they all lived or died.  This keeps the interest level at precisely zero, and that's about all I've got to say about this stinky waste of time. 5",1162339200,,612,4.577981651376147
2447022,3,B000BYA5HS,"Tamara is a high school girl who just doesn't fit in very well.  She is quiet and plain on the outside but full of normal emotions on the inside.  She has a crush on a teacher and has fantasies concerning them.  Her feelings can be hurt and she wants to strike back.  But her bookish nature puts her on the track of some witchcraft books.  One has a spell that will make the object of her crush fall for her.  But when it gets to the final step of the spell, Tamara chickens out.  But the spell is accidently completed when the popular students set a mean trap for Tamara.  A trap that results in her death.  The students decide to hide her body and say nothing.  They don't want their futures ruined by an accident.

But then Tamara returns to school.  A new and improved Tamara full of confidence and dressing to show her real beauty.  This Tamara also wants revenge for being killed and buried.  Now her touch can make people fall in love with her and they are them willing to do anything for her.  Tamara's vengeance grows and grows ans she gets more and more out of control.  Can she be stopped before everyone is killed?  You will have to watch to find out.

A little different from most teen revenge horror films.  Although not as original as Carrie or The Girl Most Likely To, it still manages to stand a bit higher than most.  Unfortunately there were a few moments where the production failed to achieve.  For instance in one scene two guys are convinced to make out.  When discovered by a girlfriend, they are completely clothed and look like they were merely hiding under the covers.  While this topic can be too edgy for some, if you are going to write it into the film, it should be done right.  But for the most part the movie stands up well and has some real tension.  If you like horror a step above typical mad slasher antics then you should check this one out.",1160524800,4,1879,4.315186246418338
2447023,3,B000BYA5HS,"I have read other reviews of this movie, and a lot of people are comparing Tamara with 80's Horror Films. I can see the comparisons, the way the movie follows a formula, and although it isn't a blatant rip-off of one certain movie, it most certainly shadows certain scenes and characters throughout.

Tamara is a quiet introvert with a talent for writing she is in love with her teacher even though he is older and married and obviously off limits. She wears outdated clothing, her eyebrows are in need of waxing, her hair is mousy and unruly, she hunches over, it's a perfect caricature of the ""nerdy ugly beautiful girl"" waiting for her big break. What is different about her is that we know she is a witch, that she has performed spells on the poor teachers wife so she won't have kids, Yes she is bullied in the shower room a la Carrie style (without the tampons) but I for one didn't feel sorry for her. She wasn't innocent, the bullies thought they would be teaching her a lesson about her feelings for teach and for exposing them for taking steroids, although that was the wrong thing to do, I do believe that Tamara needed to be shown how ridiculous the fantasy of this man leaving his wife really was. Her death was an accident, and they should have gone to the police, although Tamara would have turned into the Vamp regardless, so I understand that plot direction. Why involve the cops, when we are supposed to see how the guilty get what's coming to them through her vengeance.

What ensues is her taking them out one by one, using them as her weapons against each other, and against her ultimate enemy, the teacher's wife. The Special Effects were both chilling and disappointing. I loved the ""hear no evil, speak no evil, and see no evil"" kill, but some of the others were muddled by poor CGI and prosthetics, in that aspect it really copied the 80's motif. In the end, we don't like her and we want the survivors to live, as it should be, and the sacrifice of an innocent for the good of the group is beyond copying the 80's it  is true for stories of human nature from all times. I am sure that every male watching thought her demise was a waste, but its also true that her beauty was completely false, enhanced by witchcraft and her hatred, skin deep, and just as fragile.",1160524800,2,2289,4.445238095238095
2447024,4,B000BYA5HS,"Fans of ""TAMARA"" may want to compare it to the 1973 TV-Movie ""The Girl Most Likely To---"" ,starring Stockard Channing, which plotwise it closely resembles, the only difference being that the Channing film aims (very effectively) for laughs rather than horror.",1157241600,,259,5.341463414634147
2447025,4,B000BYA5HS,"I wouldnt even call it low budjet if it was than the acting was well done and so was the rest of the movie. Being a horror buff for years this movie is simply one of the most underrated flicks of the year. What can you say about the main character from nerd too gorgoues hot vixen killer. You are almost cheering her on she is so hot!. I only  took the time too write this because of all the bad reviews the media was giving it. So much for the experts...You wanna spend a quality $3.99 it is easily worth the rent. And too all the haters ya'll never get it. So called experts eating cheese and wine.....get a life man. good stuff. Too all the die-hards see this flick, Carl",1156204800,3,674,4.106060606060606
2447026,5,B000BYA5HS,"This film was really vicious so BE WARNED, you need a strong stomach, but the storyline was really solid and fast paced.  I am surprised more people haven't seen it, it deserves the recognition.",1155254400,2,194,4.705882352941177
2447027,5,B000BYA5HS,"As I prepared to watch this movie, I just had a feeling that this was going to be something special, something that would really knock me over somehow - despite the fact it's a direct-to-DVD release from Lions Gate, it didn't sound all that original and would almost certainly be rather predictable, and I had never heard of any of the actors and actresses in the cast.  That feeling I had turned out to be right on the money.  I would just like to thank the director, the casting director, and whoever else was involved in casting Jenna Dewan as Tamara because this young lady is talented, captivating, and absolutely, positively, drop-dead gorgeous.  I thought I had seen sexy women before, but no one can hold a candle to Jenna Dewan.  This is the kind of woman who makes you want to quit your job, take off to Hollywood, and spend the rest of your life just trying to get a glimpse of her in the flesh.  I am totally smitten, as you can tell.  Dewan bears a striking resemblance to Denise Richards - I swear she could be Denise's younger, even more beautiful sister.

With its I Know What You Did Last Summer meets Devil in the Flesh meets Jawbreaker meets The Craft kind of storyline, Tamara doesn't really break any new ground - but it does rise above its derivative origins and forge an identity all its own.  Screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick maintains a surprisingly tight plot throughout, leaving few questions unanswered, and he even succeeds in giving us a final scene that isn't silly or campy at all.  When I start describing the plot points, you'll think you've seen all of them before, and you have, but you probably haven't seen them all brought together in such impressive fashion as this.  It all starts with your basic high school outcast.  Tamara is a rather plain girl (and I must say the makeup department deserves some kind of major award for actually making Jenna Dewan look plain) with no friends, an unhappy home life, a crush on her English teacher, Mr. Natolly (Matthew Marsden), and an intense interest in witchcraft.  She is also smart, which ends up getting her in trouble when her article about performance-enhancing drug use among some of the school's athletes is published.  Dumb jocks don't get mad, they get even, and they cook up a particularly vicious prank to play on poor Tamara - dragging the local AV geek and a couple of new students into the plot with them.  As so often happens, things get out of hand and - well, Tamara dies.  The others get rid of the body and swear to never mention the night's events again.

Everything would probably have been fine if Tamara hadn't shown up for class a couple of days later.  As if that's not surprising enough, plain old Tamara has suddenly turned into the hottest woman on the face of the earth.  Needless to say, Tamara's not about to forgive and forget.  Now she could just go around killing all of those who wronged her, but that wouldn't be all that fun, would it?  And we certainly don't want any blood getting on any of her new slinky dresses or ruining her makeup.  Since she now has the power to control anyone with just a touch, her revenge is going to be all the sweeter.  Besides, she also needs time to work on stealing Mr. Natolly away from his wife.

In case you're wondering - yes, there will be blood.  And gore, too.  The special effects are a little uneven, but they're pretty satisfying overall.  A couple of the earlier scenes look ridiculously fake, but the first of Tamara's victims dies a most satisfying, impressive death,  and all of the later scenes are more than satisfactorily done.  The crew even takes the time to add little unnecessary details, earning them extra kudos in my book.  There's nothing here to make a gorehound flinch, but I would expect a few eeeewwwws from your average viewer.  Technically, I wouldn't even classify Tamara as horror; it's really more of a psychological thriller with strong horror overtones.

Obviously, I think Tamara is an excellent film.  It's particularly impressive for a direct-to-DVD release.  It comes from the creator of Final Destination, so it should be no surprise that the plot is much more than a mere excuse for stringing a few death scenes together.  For me, though, this film is all about Jenna Dewan, who simply owns the camera.  This young lady ought to be a superstar - I know I'd gladly pay to watch her do anything at all.",1154995200,2,4390,4.598971722365039
2447028,4,B000BYA5HS,"Tamara was a good entertaining horror/teenage angst movie in the same vein as De Palma's Carrie and pretty much most of the teenage revenge/slasher flicks of the late 70's and early 80's. Such horror films involved the high school jocks and popular cliques getting their comeuppance by way of the nerdy student who has had enough. This time around the nerd in question is one Tamara whose shy, bookish and frumpy nature makes her an easy mark for every other kid in school.

Newcomer and extremely hot Jenna Dewan plays the title role and she does a very good job pulling off the dual personality role Tamara goes through the film. The first half of the film Dewan was very believable as the mousy and nerdy student whose low self-esteem adds to keeping her ostracized from the rest of the student population. It doesn't help that she begins to misread one of her teacher's (played by Matthew Marsden) attempts to help her as some sort of seduction she so craves. There is a small bit of a bright side to her daily existence in the form Chloe (played by Katie Stuart), she of the popular girl with a heart-of-gold role. Tamara's life soon turns for the worst as her attempts to show her love for her helpful teacher is rebuffed and her published article about drug-use in athletics puts her in the crosshairs of a couple of jocks with much to lose.

Typical of such teenage revenge horror movies, the cruel jocks and popular kids concoct a plan to humiliate and embarrass Tamara, but just like those past films their plans backfire and the target of their pans gets killed during the the prank. The filmmaker really don't add something new to this tried and tested formula. Instead of calling for the authorities to report the accidental death of their schoolmate, the kids decide, through the bullying of the alpha-male in the group, to bury Tamra instead and forget anything ever happened. This plan probably would've worked if Tamara wasn't dabbling in witchcraft as ostracized teenagers are won't to do. Tamara's spell prior to the prank to spellbound her teacher backfires as its activated by the spilling of her blood and to the surprise of the students who did her harm she returns alive, healthy and completely different the start of the new school week.

To say that Tamara returns utterly different in more ways than one is an understatement. Ms. Dewan does a vampy, sometimes campy, job portraying the new and improved Tamara. Dewan goes from nerdy, plain-jane Tamara to ultra-sexy, barely there skirt wearing teen seductress whose touch does more than seduce those she has targeted for revenge. Jenna Dewan as the reborn Tamara steams up the screen with her overt sexuality and he practically saves the film from just being an ok, by-the-numbers horror movie. Tamara is Ms. Dewan's film from beginning to end and she does a very good job of keeping the story interesting even if it meant just being on the screen.

This film doesn't break new ground in the realm of teen horror. In fact, it's a mish-mash of alot of past teen horror flicks of the past that one could see the many influences in its story. Tamara is part Carrie, Black Christmas, The Craft and a slew of other teenage horror movies. The direction is adequate at best and that's really all one could hope for in a genre film like Tamara. What makes this film entertaining and worth watching is the joy of discovering the new talent in Jenna Dewan. Tamara might not be a great horror film, but Ms. Dewan sure more than tries to make it more than it's B-movie pedigree.",1154822400,19,3543,4.682182985553772
2447029,5,B000BYA5HS,"I first heard of this movie when I was watching the trailers for Saw 2, The preview showed a promising movie in return, and as expected, it didn't let me down. This movie follows young Tamara Riley, who just recently wrote an article about the jocks taking steroids, when the jocks refuse to take the drug test, they're benched the rest of the season. That is the time, they decide to exact their revenge. Using Tamara's love for the English Teacher, Mr. Natolly, they plant a trap at a motel where Tamara is "" supposed to meet him there"" with Tamara ending up dead, not wanting to get a police record, the students involved bury her. The next day we see Tamara with a completely changed attitude along with a complete change of wardrobe, let's just say that Tamara isn't settling for apologies, I won't give anymore away, so watch and see for yourself, I give this product five stars.",1153699200,,885,4.5375
2447030,5,B000BYA5HS,"I just saw Tamara, this weekend. I must say I am disappointed at all the bad publicity this movie is getting. I mean when the team who brought you final destination 1,2, and 3, are doing the story yu know there will be gruesome deaths, and nasty effects. First of all I have seen bigger budget pictures screw up scare effects, because when the mvie gets released it seems more funny than scary, point  in case ""THe Grudge."" I loved the fact that Tamara did not go around killing anyone she felt like, she strictly went with what she saw about their past. Also the dialogue did have some weak line but the actors did a pretty good job, except for the two jocks useing steroids, but then she made them have anal sex. So they got a deeper friendship and that was enough said. The movie has ethics about when you feel guilty about what you have done. I appreciated the fact that though Tamara admits its short comings, it delievers a punch that will shock you......Oh by the way, anyne who is a real witch or sudies the ancient craft will appreciate some of the honesty delievered in Tamara.",1152576000,2,1087,4.407960199004975

This is one of those rare straight-to-DVD horror films that actually turned out alright. The story was ok, the acting was bad at times but give this one a try if you are a horror buff. This movie deserves three stars for a (low budjet) straight-to-DVD project. Although, if this movie had been released into theaters I would give it two and a half stars.",1151107200,3,407,4.285714285714286
8094259,4,B000BYA5HS,"RELEASED IN 2005-2006 and directed by Jeremy Haft, ""Tamara is a Canadian production about an unpopular girl (Jenna Dewan Tatum) at a Winnipeg high school who is harassed by her peers and inadvertently buys the farm in a malevolent prank. Through the dark power of witchcraft, however, she returns as a wannabe seductress to enact revenge. Matthew Marsden and Claudette Mink play a married teacher and administrator at the school.

Tarmara contains elements of Carrie (1976), The Rage: Carrie 2 (1998), The House on Sorority Row (1983) (which was remade as Sorority Row in 20009), The Craft (1996) and The Faculty (1998). Yet it mixes its own brew and, surprisingly, has a few original aspects, along with respectable gore, if thats your thang. The movie influenced future flicks like Ill Always Know what you did Last Summer (2006) and, especially, Jennifers Body (2009). If you like these kinds of films, youll like this one.

There are some awkward or un-compelling moments in the filmmaking. With just a few key tweaks this couldve been great in the manner of The Rage: Carrie 2. Still, its good enough and, like I said, has some innovative parts. Marsden and Mink are strong as the adult protagonists. The women are cute (e.g. Katie Stuart as winsome Chloe) but, with the exception of Mink, they look like they're suffering mild anorexia. Please, ladies, eat some food!

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 38 minutes and was shot in Winnipeg, Manitoba. WRITER: Jeffrey Reddick.

8094267,3,B000BYA5HS,"Yup, Tamara is something that could have followed up ""Rage: Carrie 2"" and flat out been Carrie 3... but even saying that, it's still a decent flick on it's own, and it's not quite Carrie, but does have the same formula.

So Tamara is a nerdy shy girl who has never been popular and always picked on, but it gets worse for her in her senior year after she releases a story in the school newspaper about some of the players on the football team taking performance enhancing drugs. This leads to the jocks and their girlfriends targeting Tamara and wanting to take it out on her that they have been exposed as drug cheats etc...
The jocks and a few others take part in an event that leads to Tamara's accidental death. They agree to pull a ""I know what you did last summer"" job and bury her and keep it a secret.
However the very next day Tamara walks into class a changed woman and those who played a part in her death have no idea how to react, especially when Tamara is now a completely changed girl and isn't hiding their secret to anyone.

Overall, I liked it... it was recommended on one of those sites after I typed in look for something simmilar to ""13 Ghosts"" and this was the only one that popped up I had not heard of before. It was great for one nights viewing, and cured my craving for a decent supernatural flick. I also discovered it's made by those who made the Final Destination films... and tho I'm a bit disappointed none of the kill scenes in this are awesome and creative like in the FD films, it still was a satisfying enough watch for at least one viewing. I don't think I'd purchase it to keep or have an urge to watch it again anytime again soon, but if I ever forget the film in a few years, i'll remind myself now to check it out again.",1490745600,,1760,4.2195845697329375
