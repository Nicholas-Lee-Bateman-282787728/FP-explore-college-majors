289734,3,6300269469,"In this rather tepid film suave Warren Beatty attempts to seduce aging actress Vivien Leigh following the death of her husband. Based on a story by Tennessee Williams, this was one of Leigh's last, great showcases. Even  towards the end of her life she still remained captivating (and a consumate  actress). Her performance makes this slow, trying film worthwhile. Warren  Beatty approaches camp with his greasy giggolo character, and the accent is  just a touch shaky. At any rate, Lotte Lenya received a well-deserved Oscar  nod for her perfomance as Beatty's ""arranger of romances.""",960854400,3,585,5.180851063829787

289792,4,6300269469,"Perhaps the line that sums up Tennessee Williams' sensibility the best comes from his play EL CAMINO REAL, ""Humankind cannot bear too much reality.""  Williams' recurring theme is the desperate and usually doomed search for lasting love, and the decay of soul and body that occurs when his characters lose it, or don't find it at all.

The frailty of the human condition is most often embodied by Williams' vulnerable, aging heroines, aware of their diminishing desirability while remaining imprisoned by their fears and despairing hopes.  The drama comes from the heroine's fight to preserve her gossamer dreams and ward off her inevitable, shattering disillusionment.  THE ROMAN SPRING OF MRS. STONE once again revisits these motifs so evident in his classic plays A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and THE GLASS MENAGERIE.  Maggie in CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF seems noteworthy as the only major Williams' heroine with the courage to face the truth head-on and wrest the love she is hungry for from her faltering husband.

The majestic Vivien Leigh perfectly suits the role of Mrs. Stone, the character who represents Williams' dissolute melancholy to a 't', although I'd have to say this work, which is sleazy at heart, is beneath her.  Leigh was the screen's greatest romantic tragedienne.  Only Garbo might compare to her.  From GONE WITH THE WIND on, Leigh was cast as the proud, often headstrong woman who ultimately faces crushing disappointment in love.  She unforgettably portrayed variations of that element in WATERLOO BRIDGE (where her dashed hopes lead to suicide), THAT HAMILTON WOMAN (ending up imprisoned as a bereft, impoverished sneak thief), ANNA KARENINA (another suicide), STREETCAR (asylum-bound as a rape victim with a crumbled mind), THE DEEP BLUE SEA (abandoned), ROMAN SPRING (willingly submitting to an Angel of Death), and SHIP OF FOOLS (vindictive, embittered divorcee).  Her only departure from the theme in the eight films she made after GWTW was her spritely young queen in CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA.  It almost comes as a surprise, viewing that film in the context of the rest of her movies, that her young Cleopatra does not come to a baleful end (but we know, historically, that in time Cleopatra did meet a famous demise).

Leigh is and always will be my favorite actress.  But part of what made her so haunting in these typical roles was the oft-noted parallels of her ""unhappy ending"" films to the tenor and events of her own life.  She maintained the fairy tale marriage to Laurence Olivier that went sour as he eventually found solace with a younger woman (they were divorced the year before MRS. STONE was released).  She coped with manic-depression.  She endured the disappointing results of her attempts to rival Olivier on stage--efforts for which she largely sacrificed her legendary movie career, although film was the medium in which she easily outshone him.  Finally, she suffered the tuberculosis that prematurely took her life.  Seen in this light, MRS. STONE seems almost biographical, as she sadly drifts through the streets of Rome, facing the void.  She seems numb in the role.  Only in the scenes backstage of Karen. Stone's failing play does Leigh display flashes of the aliveness and fire she possessed as Scarlett.  Yet even in this subdued state, Leigh is mesmerizing as always.  Even in her scenes with alluring young Warren Beatty, we watch her not him.

I can see why Beatty wanted the role.  It is a flashy one, well-suited to his growing reputation as a ladies' man.  But as a newcomer, he perhaps underestimated the dampening effect that appearing opposite iconic powerhouse Leigh would have on his screen impact.  That he nevertheless manages to hold something of a candle to her in only his second film is credit to him.  He seems remarkably self-assured and his Italian accent sounded surprisingly good to me.

Of course, Beatty as a Lothario presents a simpler case of art imitating life.  Hollywood's most notorious stud was always reluctant to show much skin on the screen, but he does a couple of sunbathing scenes that reveal his Adonis physique (and I was struck by how much his slender, muscular, former football lineman's legs resembled his sister Shirley MacLaine's famous gams).

But, Beatty aside, what of Williams' male characters?  Are they doomed as well for their arrogance and presumptive attitudes toward love, like Paul Newman's Change Wayne in SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH?  There is a double tragedy in MRS. STONE.  In a sense Mrs. Stone's demise is sad but not a tragedy, for by then she has wrestled with her nature and come to know herself.  Paolo, on the other hand, in his self-centered conceit, remains totally unaware of himself and willfully ignorant of the bleak future prospects for a gigolo as he squanders his youth and looks.  As he ages and his prized commodity, his looks, fade, there will be no redemption for him.  The Contessa, his pimp, will mercilessly discard him for younger men, or she will foist him off to service some old roue like the Baron.

Mrs. Stone loses hope; Paulo never gains perspective.  There is a double disaster unfolding in this story that critics overlook.",1429574400,2,5159,4.975495915985998

This story is about the loneliness and escapades of a newly widowed past-prime stage actress
in Rome surrounded by a pack of unsavory characters including faded nobility, hangers-on,
young upcoming 'stars' and gigolos.
The film was based on Tennessee William's only novel and directed by Broadway stage director
Jose Quintero (it shows by the film's stagy camera settings and sluggish camera movements).
52 years after its first release, the film now looked a bit dated but Vivien Leigh remained a great
actress in her final film with fine support by the young and great-looking Warren Beatty.

289892,4,6300269469,"Today was my very first time watching this. didn't have a desire or anything to see it but today, I happened to catch it on TCM(bless you TCM)and I was intrigued. For one, I believe if they did this same movie today(and I see a later version with Helen Mirren),I feel that the ending would be different. For one, you have this lady(Vivien Leigh)whose comeback was a flop and closes the show and leaves town with her husband who lovingly indulges her. Sadly, on the trip to Rome, he dies enroute. Sad,lonely,bereft, she goes about town dealing with her sorrow. But, there are those who come along and surely funk things up if you get my drift. Along comes this woman, a countessa(Lotte Lenya)who in actuality is a unadulterated ""pimp"" straight up. My guess is she is impoverished and she provides companionship to lonely American expatriates with an upfront fee of 50% to keep her in the lifestyle she is accustomed to, and she goes around town with her charges hoping to palm them off to lonely and well paid Americans and others who can afford to pay for the company of such people. Of course, Stone(Leigh)rejects it, but with time and some persuasion from Beatty(Paolo, with some coaching from Lenya),she does. What bothers me with this is not so much that she took a lover, but that she is ridiculed by the very people she helps and provides for, as well as others. I will admit that up until the latter part of the last century, older women were ridiculed for having younger men in their lives. Today, Mrs Stone could be like Meryl Streep, do a string of great film roles, glorify and mellow in her maturity and on the fact that she still got the juice. In this film, although the need to be with someone is most definitely a need, and  a requirement in order to live and thrive,it is pushed aside in her case and I find it sad. Stone(Leigh)in the film stated on the fact of being desired or not at all. I found her statement quite telling and revealing. Her other statement on having three or four years to enjoy life then move on was quite as omnious. Interesting tale but I wouldn't call it her roman spring, but winter tale.. just my take. As far as the roles, Leigh, Beatty and Lenya were great. sadly, this was one of the last films of Vivien Leigh, who seems to possess a fragile spirit borne in life to her roles with the exception of Gone With The Wind.",1335398400,,2366,4.451612903225806
289893,3,6300269469,"As a Gone With The Wind fan, I watched this movie primarily because Vivien Leigh was in it and I wanted to see how she was in her later years.  She does an excellent job of her role, she is of course an Oscar Winning Actress.  But her smoker's voice is a stark contrast to her light-hearted Scarlett O'Hara voice.  The film is based on a Tennessee Williams novel.  Which for those of us who hold the dissenting opinion of his works, that means the story is weird and obsessed with passion.  The movie features a young Warren Beatty, who does a convincing job of portraying a young Italian gigolo.  The main flaw of the film is his sudden outbursts without provocation.  It makes one wonder why Mrs. Stone (Viven Leigh) bothers to stay with such a moody and troublesome man.  The ending is almost European in style, in other words not a happy ending and not entirely clear.  I will say that the film does draw the viewer in and I found myself paying attention even though it is very slow moving.  It isn't the best film out there by any means, but it isn't the worst either.",1333584000,,1073,4.346733668341709
289894,3,6300269469,"Recommend this seemy tale, one of Vivien Leigh's final films and one of Warren Beatty's first.  She is haunting as an aging, widowed actress trying to regain a foothold on her life in Rome, and he is fine as a gigolo, with whom she becomes infatuated.  It also includes a wonderful performance by Lotte Lenya as his pimp, a dissolute old Countess.  This evocative story is not the most cheerful, but is certainly involving up to its somewhat mysterious ending.  I would add that it is very erotic without once getting even slightly explicit.  That says something.",1317600000,,563,4.762886597938144
289895,2,6300269469,"This is a very slow paced story with really nowhere to go. The acting was quite atrocious, including Vivien Leigh's. Her performance was simply laughable and unconvincing, especially her reactions to Warren Beatty when he was being an ass to her. Beatty was definitely miscast, since his Italian accent was very bad, and he wasn't good looking enough to play an irresistible gigolo. Come on, why would rich American women lust after a scrawny, beady-eyed, fat lipped Beatty? The ending will just piss the hell out you after having spend so much time suffering through this mess.",1299456000,3,578,4.969072164948454
289896,3,6300269469,"In most movies of this period dealing with prostitution, it is always a man buying a girl. However, strangely for 1961, the roles are reversed. Vivien Leigh is the lonely middle-aged rich widow spending money on gigolo Warren Beatty, not knowing until the end that he never really loved her. Famous line, ""I'm drifting."" Ironically, Vivien Leigh was drifting. She was just divorced from Sir. Laurence Oliver and was facing a life without him. Warren Beatty gives a credible perfomance as the gigolo. Jill St. John looks so beautiful, and according to the interview on this dvd, Vivien Leigh was jealous of her. Vivien never did talk to Jill St. John during filming of the movie. She only nodded. The was Tennessee William's only novel and according to interview, he based the Vivien Leigh character off himself, Williams was a homosexual. I gave the movie a 3 rating because it is slow . Also, compared to William's other plays, this doesn't have much of a plot. However, the acting is fabulous. The setting is in beautiful Rome, Italy with many beautiful scenes. The colors are vibrant and beautiful. This was Ms. Leigh's last major role. She died 6 years later.",1295136000,,1163,4.82
289897,5,6300269469,"Taking on the role of Karen Stone was an act of considerable courage by Vivien Leigh; there were too many unfortunate parallels where life imitated art.  Mrs. Stone loses her husband of twenty years to a fatal heart attack, Ms. Leigh was divorced from her husband of twenty years Sir Laurence Olivier shortly before she began filming, which was his choice not hers.  Both were starting new lives alone, were approximately the same age in the late forties, and were worried about aging and losing their beauty, and as both were actresses, the scarcity of roles that were age appropriate.  That is where the resemblance ends however; Mrs. Stone inevitably gives in to despair, but not so Vivien Leigh who would gallantly challenge and valiantly fight the cruel fates of manic depression, aging and tuberculosis that would ultimately cause her untimely death at age fifty-three.

Based on a Tennessee Williams novella, ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" is the story of a renowned middle-aged American actress Karen Stone (Leigh), who flees to Rome with her wealthy invalid husband (John Phillips) after a disastrous try as Shakespeare's young heroine Rosalind in ""As You Like It"".  En route, Mr. Stone succumbs to heart failure.  Bereft of both her husband and her career, Mrs. Stone decides to take an apartment and remain in Rome indefinitely.  At loose ends, she is increasingly aware she's beginning to ""drift"" without any direction, which alarms her.  This plus her status as a vulnerable rich widow, makes her prey for an unsavory Contessa  (Lotte Lenya) who is nothing more than a female pimp that dangles vain pretty boy Paulo DiLeo (Warren Beatty) in Mrs. Stone's path.  At first resistant, Mrs. Stone's loneliness and susceptibility lead her to be drawn into their web, despite warnings from her astute, caring best friend Meg Bishop (Coral Browne).

The biggest flaw in this movie is the casting of Vivien Leigh.  Aged forty-seven when filming, Ms. Leigh is still so breathtaking beautiful and magnetic that there is no way she would ever need the services of a gigolo.  Except for Audrey Hepburn no actress moved with such poise and grace in every movement, she is the embodiment of Lord Bryon's poem ""She Walks in Beauty Like the Night.""  Exquisitely gowned by her favorite Parisian courtier, the celebrated Pierre Balmain, immaculately coifed and made up, impeccably well bred and intelligent, she is any man's dream mature woman, you'd never do better!  With the added inducements of wealth and celebrity, men of all ages would be beating a path to her door!

Now, just to contradict myself, the film's biggest asset is Vivien Leigh!  She is such a consummate actress that she makes you believe that despite all the above advantages, Mrs. Stone is possessed by the twin demons of loneliness and insecurity. These linked to the double shock of losing both her husband and career almost simultaneously cause her to act irrationally and recklessly.  In repose her face is eloquent in expressing emotion, the eyes haunted with a private grief.  She makes the viewer empathize and care for her, and this is what makes the film ultimately succeed.

This was Warren Beatty's second film and not much of a stretch for him playing a spoiled, petulant, indolent young man who will always love his own reflection in the mirror more than any woman.  However, as written Paulo has about the depth of a birdbath, so there's not much he can do with the role.  With her wide jack o' lantern grin, and flaming hennaed hair, Lotte Lenya is chillingly corrupt and decadent as the barracuda of a Contessa who makes her living off a stable of young boys parceled out to a moneyed clientele of both sexes.  She deservedly received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  Coral Browne as Meg Bishop, Karen's true best friend is wonderful, cultivated, elegant and statuesque, full of forthright common sense trying to save Karen from her darker instincts.  Another parallel, Ms. Leigh and Ms. Browne were very close friends in real life, Ms. Browne allegedly one of the friends that visited Ms. Leigh the day she died.  The cast is rounded out by two smaller but key roles, Jill St. John as the bubble headed, nubile American starlet Barbara Bingham and Jeremy Spenser as a dark, sinister homeless young man who is stalking the hapless Mrs. Stone.  Also look for in cameos both quite young, Cleo Laine as a singer in a nightclub, and Jean Marsh of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" fame as one of Paolo's conquests.

Acclaimed New York theatre director Jose Quintero directed this his one and only film; as an initial effort, he does quite well.  The screenplay is expertly adapted by Gavin Lambert and provides several memorable scenes for the Misses Leigh, Lenya and Browne.  Kudos to production designer Roger Furse, the movie was filmed in London but you'd never know it by his sets, he evokes a Rome that is not the sunlit, joyous ""Eternal City"" of say ""Roman Holiday"", but one that is ominous and disquieting with a sense of inner decay.  Mrs. Stone's sumptuously appointed rooftop apartment perched in lofty splendor above the cascade of the Spanish Steps reflects the lady's breeding and good taste, but ultimately is not a safe haven for her.

The extras in the DVD are the original theatrical trailer and a short featurette entitled ""Mrs. Stone: Looking for Love in All the Dark Corners"" that is moderately interesting and features Jill St. John and Tennessee Williams biographer Donald Spoto.

Supposedly this  was Tennessee Williams favorite film adaption of his works; he considered it almost a poem, and Vivien Leigh as Mrs. Stone one of his truest film heroines.  Since his other memorable film heroines included Blanche Du Bois, Maggie the Cat, Catharine Holly and Alexandra del Lago, this is high praise indeed.

Although Ms. Leigh illuminates Mrs. Stone with her artistry, it's regrettable that she played so many ill-fated or unhappy characters in her few film appearances.  On the stage she was a sparkling comedienne as in ""The Skin of Our Teeth"", ""The School for Scandal"", and ""Look After Lulu"".  Another film released the same year as ""Roman Spring..."" was a charming romantic comedy called ""The Pleasure of His Company"" where Lilli Palmer played an enchanting, witty, sophisticated mature woman who more than holds her own with former husband Fred Astaire and current husband Gary Merrill to a happy conclusion.  This would have been a welcome change of pace and Vivien Leigh's star would have shone that much brighter if she could have played this role in addition to poor Mrs. Stone.",1281571200,15,6603,4.935804701627487

Warren Beatty's ""preformance"" is excruiatingly ""high school play"" - way out of his league with Leigh, Lotte Lenya (an over the top, scenery-chewing interpretation), and Coral Browne.

I have a sentimental soft-spot for this film, but in reality it really isn't a success the SHOWTIME adaptation ( with the great Helen Mirren) is very close to the original short story. In 1961 the moronic censors would not allow a Williams adaptation to be filmed without major alterations (A Streetcar Named Desire - Sweet Bird of Youth - Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, were all but ruined had it not been for some very clever screenwriters).

Vivien Leigh is fabulous as Mrs. Stone. She has exactly the right degree of world weariness and vulnerability, and of course even towards the the end of her career when this picture was made, she embodies my idea of glamour.

Warren Beatty is the ideal gigolo. His Italian accent may not be perfect, but I don't believe that anyone could have done it better. He looks just right, and of course he turned out in later life to be a great womaniser, so this role is almost type casting.

All in all it is a wonderful addition to my movie collection.",1153785600,4,695,4.596774193548387
289935,3,6300269469,"This film is worth seeing because of the talents involved. Vivien Leigh continues her fictional autobiography on film, Scarlett in desperation became Blanche but found a rich husband who dies and she ends as the despondent Mrs. Stone, which somewhat mirrored Leigh's own troubled life, at least in trajectory. Leigh's mental problems and nymphomania bleed through brief moments in the performance and make it uncomfortable if real. Warren Beatty is physically blessed for the role of gigilo supreme (his own personal qualities bleed through as well) but his inability to play an Italian is so obvious  the part should have been rewritten into Paul the American ex-pat. Lotte Lenya in her first screen role since Pabst's ""Threepenny"" in the early 30s is perfection as the Countess pimp. Her relationship with her pet is the most powerful in the film. She's worth having it for alone. Williams script is flawed by the pervasive Death Wish theme, there is no where to go with the story, it becomes a very intimate flat scandalous tabloid story (very much kin to ""The Misfits""). Quintero, one of the great theater talents (personally responsible for the revival of Eugene O'Neill from oblivion), does not know how to shape a film and in particular the end, which should have power, hardly registers. When such great talents work together, it is worth seeing even if only to see where even they went wrong. If the others had worked with the focus and force of Lenya, this film would have been something much greater than it is.",1146441600,2,1522,4.89922480620155

VIVIEN LEIGH in her next to last role, shines in her undrplaying and is strongly supported by Warren Beatty(called Warren Beauty by Arlene Dahl), Lotte Lenya, Jill St. John and Ernst Thesiger(who appeared with Vivien in CAEASAR AND CLEOPATRA).

289937,4,6300269469,"Another Tennesse Williams piece of work for the divine AND talented Vivien Leigh to take on.  It's too sad to know it was her second last film of her career/life.  We all know how superb she was in Streetcar as Blanche du Bois and she gives just another wonderful performance here as the depressingly lonely Karen Stone, an American actress past her prime who settles in Rome after the death of her older husband.  Shades of Blanche did shine here and there throughout the film.  Warren Beatty is pretty (ahem, ""pretty"") good as her handsome and cocky boy-toy, and as mentioned in numerous previous reviews, his accent is, unfortunately, quite laughable at times.

I don't have anything decent to say about Jill St John's performance (I cringed or laughed whenever she was on screen) but Lotte Lenya was incredibly good as the Contessa, the ""female pimp"" who procures males for the lonely ladies of Rome. ***Spoilers****.....My main gripe is the so-called stalker (sorry, I have not read the novella), like how many chances did Karen Stone have to confront him, to tell him to bugger off, and report him to the police!!!  That part didn't seem realistic that she would let him stalk her over and over.  But then again, I guess he ties in with the tragic ending.

Watch it for the setting, beautiful clothes, and of course, a sensitive and touching performance by the lengendary Vivien Leigh, not many actresses at that time looked so beautiful in their late 40's and can act.",1095033600,7,1475,4.756862745098039
289938,3,6300269469,"Vivian Leigh (of Gone With The Wind (1939) plays a Broadway star, Mrs. Karen Stone. She is 48 years of age.  Her husband suddenly dies on an airplane trip.  She retreats to Rome.  She is mourning, miserable and lonely.  She meets a Contessa (Lotte Lenya) who arranges a young French man, Paolo (Warren Beatty) to be ""company"" to her.  Paolo is an ""escort"", a ""gigolo"" if you will.  Mrs. Stone and Paolo begin to date on a professional level.  It is nothing, but cordial.  After weeks of courting and Mrs. Stone keeping this ""arrangement"" at a discreet level, she finally relaxes with Paolo and recites the memorable line, ""When the time comes when nobody desires me for myself, I'd rather not be desired at all.""  Mrs. Stone awaits in the bed.  Paolo catches the hint and takes the lead and they make love for the first time.  A wild romance begins.  It is love springs eternal for Mrs. Stone.  But can this May-December romance last?  The very surprise end of this film will have your mouth dropped wide open.  If your jaws are not sore already.  Very provocative and sexy film for 1961 and even for 48 year old Vivian Leigh.  Also in the cast: Jill St. John, Jean Marsh and Coral Browne.  Sadly, Vivian Leigh died six years later after this film in 1967.

7808022,5,6300269469,I spent the last weekend looking at this version of Mrs Stone and the far later version . I have read the short novel often . This version with Vivien Leigh is very true to the book and has not been dolled up in any way nor has had anything added to the story .On the other hand the later version is a glossy version with many additional material that is not in the book...more of a based on type of film . Personally I could barely look at the later edition but this one is so nicely understated that it is a real treat and is on my list of favourite films. Vivien Leigh makes the film ..she is all class .,1514851200,,607,3.9430894308943087

7808029,4,6300269469,"I became fascinated reading Tennessee Williams' short 1950 novel,  ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" and wanted to see its two film adaptations both for themselves and to better understand the story. During his work on the novel, Williams had imagined it on screen starring the famed actress Greta Garbo. It is perhaps unsurprising that the two films have received more attention than Williams' book.

I saw the second film first: a 2003 Showtime feature starring Helen Mirren.  I then turned to this 1961 film starring the celebrated actress Vivian Leigh and directed by Jose Quntero.  Quintero achieved fame as a theater director. ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" is his only film.  Neither film fully realizes the novel, but each is good and each enhanced my appreciation of the book.

Williams' novel and both films tell the story of Karen Stone, an actress of 50 who is losing her beauty and whose wealthy husband dies early in the film. The couple's sex life had been nil. Karen Stone settles in post WW II Rome where she is lonely and suffers from the boredom and rootlessness she calls the ""drift"". She seeks the passion and physical intimacy she lacked with her husband and in her career as an actress.  A sinister, elderly Contessa sets up Mrs Stone with a series of gigolos, of whom the most important is the young, handsome, and cruel Paolo, 25. Paolo sets out to bilk Mrs. Stone of her money, but she is rather too cagey for him. However, she falls for the young gigolo and deludes herself into believing that the gigolo has fallen for her.  Mrs Stone finally realizes that she has been deluding herself and dismisses Paolo and the Contessa.  Startlingly, she takes up with a young impoverished man who has been stalking her.  Her loneliness has led to risk which in this case bids to be self-destructive.

The book manages to be beautiful and sordid in the manner of Tennessee Williams. The two film versions use different screenplays, neither of which is by Williams, and tone down the harshness of the story.  The early film understandably has fewer sex scenes than the Showtime film which includes extensive partial nudity and simulated sex.

Besides Vivian Leigh, the earlier film features Warren Beatty as Paolo.  He offers a surprisingly creditable performance but is not as convincing as his Italian counterpart in the 2003 remake. Lotte Lenya gives an outstanding performance as the Contessa and received an Academy Award nomination.  The 2003 film features an outstanding performance as the Contessa by Anne Bancroft in her last role. Helen Mirren offers an effective portrayal of Mrs. Stone in the Showtime film but I enjoyed Leigh's more.

Both films downplay Williams' lengthy backstory of Mrs. Stone.  This story sometimes drags in the novel but is essential to understanding Mrs Stone's character. The Hollywood film features spectacular, lavish scenes of Rome and of decadent apartments while the Showtime film is more subdued. The early film does not use the theme of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" which figures large in the novel and in the second film. While more restrained due to the film code of the day, the 1961 film in its subdued way probably is more convincing in showing the smoldering passion underlying Mrs Stone while the Showtime version stresses sexuality.  The 2003 film adds a playwright character, Christopher, clearly modeled on Williams.  I found that touch interesting and imaginative.

The 1961 film has never been regarded as entirely successful while the 2003 remake has been well-received. While I liked both, I prefer Vivien Leigh in the earlier movie.  Both films are slowly paced.

Tennessee Williams novel is tragically quirky and tells the story of growing old, loneliness, frustrated sexuality, taking risks, and self-destructive behavior.  The book deserves more recognition than it has received. Both films are enjoyable.  But in the end they brought me back to Tennessee Williams and his novel.
