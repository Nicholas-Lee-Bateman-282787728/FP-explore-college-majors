8294873,5,B001DTTMWO,"Own all of the ""This is the Sea"" series!  Highly recommend it if you are into paddling or like watching travel expeditions.  Very entertaining as well as informational.",1401840000,,168,4.964285714285714
8294874,5,B001DTTMWO,"I thought that TITS (This Is The Sea)#1, #2 and #3 were very good and I continue to watch them.  It's fun to watch Justine's development as a skilled marine videographer.  TITS #4 continues the trend of entertaining, enlivening sea kayak videos.  Whenever I need to get re-stoked for sea kayaking I simply pop one of this series in the player and next thing I know I find myself loading the kayak for a trip to the water.  Just note though that if you are looking for an instructional vid these are not in that genre.  More inspirational than instructional.",1354147200,,557,4.53
8294875,5,B001DTTMWO,"This is the 4th video from the series.  It has been just as good as the other 3 videos before it.  This video, like the others is a great inspirational video.  The film maker has caught the essence of sea kayaking and makes you want to get out there in your own kayak and have fun and challenge yourself.  Prior to purchasing this series of videos I was a little worried that I would get some type of boring documentary, however, they are very entertaining.  The music that was chosen for each segment is great.  The video follows several different kayakers from differnt areas of the world and highlights that regions playgrounds.  I would highly recommend this video to anyone who is thinking about sea kayaking in the future or just a fun video to be inspired by.",1271289600,,766,4.507246376811594
