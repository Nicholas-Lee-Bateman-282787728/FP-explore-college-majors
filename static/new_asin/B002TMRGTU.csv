3985027,4,B002TMRGTU,"The video provides basic information about identifying and removing waste, how to make simply improvements, and how it is a continuous process.  It is very effective for a training tool to show how improvement applies in any situation. I would recommend this to any business that uses lean principles in a business or manufacturing environment.",1371513600,,344,5.254545454545455
3985028,5,B002TMRGTU,"I've been teaching Kaizen, YB, GB, and BB classes for about 6 years now, and this is one of the simplest, most to the point videos I've found to describe the concepts of lean principles. We used to use a bunch of powerpoints and my boring self in front of class - then we switched to the video. Not only are my students (adult learners) more interested, I've found the knowledge to stick with them longer than it did under our old methods. That sounds like success to me.

Pros:
- It isn't jargon laden or complicated - and it hits the very high level key points of Lean.
- It's practical and relateable for almost everyone. They get it.
- Shows that Kaizen isn't just for people with tons of training - we do it implicitly all the time, and this helps tie it back to the real world.
- There are plenty of breaks and times to stop to practice tool use - value stream mapping, waste identification, 6S, etc.

Cons:
- We've had to do additional explaining when using this video overseas. A couple people were not that familiar with butter - thinking it cheese or something else. This is a minor quibble. Bruce speaks well and is easily understood, and the process is simple enough that virtually everyone knows what making toast is like.",1371081600,3,1235,4.412280701754386
3985029,5,B002TMRGTU,"This DVD is a very good tool for introducing staff level employees to Identifying Waste.  The use of a simplistic process such as making toast really helped our staff level employees see the waste in processes.

Very Good Tool.",1337558400,,227,4.794871794871795
3985030,5,B002TMRGTU,"I have now purchased six copies of this video for six different companies.  All have found it very instructive and useful. Without a doubt, the best and simplest explanation of Waste available to date.",1325635200,,201,4.911764705882353
3985031,4,B002TMRGTU,"This was a good training video, for lean manufacturing.  It gives simple examples of what you are looking for in waste in rergards to productivity.",1320710400,,147,4.88
3985032,5,B002TMRGTU,We used this video on the 7 wastes in all processes and it was a huge success at our management retreat.  Over 100 managers watched and participated in this training and the reviews were excellent.  Developing an eye for waste in processes is what this video is all about.  Very entertaining as well!,1279497600,,300,4.622641509433962
3985033,5,B002TMRGTU,"As the Operations Manager of a manufacturing company, it can be very difficult to explain Lean Manufacturing to the various levels of an organization. This video is so well done that everyone that I have exposed it to (including my 10 year old daughter) have come away with an understanding of the purpose of Lean. I have watched the faces of my employees light up as this presentation takes something that we all understand and makes the concepts of Lean so obvious. I highly recommend this to everyone.",1257724800,,504,4.738636363636363
3985034,5,B002TMRGTU,"The GBMP DVD training series is a great way to help your company learn about Lean.  The plant tours help people visualize what Lean looks like in companies that do it well.  The Toast DVD drives right to the heart of lean by explaining the 7 wastes and teaching how to look for them and eliminate them.  Bruce Hamiliton and his team hit on all the things that get in the way of a successful Lean transformation.  The DVD's are just the right length of time, there's music, and they are very entertaining.  They are not snoozers like a lot of training videos.  The videos are a great way to introduce the Lean topics and get feedback, ideas, and engagement from employees.  The common theme, ""Everybody, Everyday"" has become our mission.",1257724800,,736,4.572519083969466
3985035,5,B002TMRGTU,"This DVD is a must have / must see for LEAN training.
I have used it in several of our in-house courses and it has never failed to entertain and illuminate.
It is one of my personal favourites.",1257724800,,193,4.105263157894737
8380286,5,B002TMRGTU,This is a great video to portray basic lean concepts to most people.  Basic terms and a process that can be related to.  I love this video.,1506556800,,139,4.111111111111111
8380287,5,B002TMRGTU,Very simple way to demonstrate a lean concept. Recommended for all types of industries.,1503964800,,87,5.285714285714286
8380288,4,B002TMRGTU,A well done video that brings the 7 forms of waste in Lean principles down to earth in a way anyone can understand.,1490572800,,115,4.043478260869565
8380289,5,B002TMRGTU,Best introduction to lean manufacturing and waste identification. Must have for your Lean training.,1450310400,,99,6.142857142857143
8380290,5,B002TMRGTU,"GBMPis the best. This video is a love/hate thing. Some people love it and some people don't. Personally...in all my years of teaching Lean, I have never found a way to introduce people to the 8 Wastes better than this video. Everyone from executives to front line workers in ANY industry will benefit from watching. Oh...and I have seen lots of people copy this video...stop the piracy. Give the author their due and purchase this.",1448841600,,431,4.76
8380291,4,B002TMRGTU,Good Video for teaching the most basic concepts of Lean Manufacturing. Not for people already aware of the 8 kinds of waste.,1432598400,,124,4.681818181818182
8380292,5,B002TMRGTU,"I used this video to kick off our process improvement initiative for a legal group. The video really set the stage for a bunch of people who all thought they were ""doing it the best way"" and opened their minds to the possibilities. Every person referred to making toast and it united them, giving them something in common that they could refer to while we were going through the process. Even though all of them rolled their eyes as the video started, by the end they could really see the value of it.",1412812800,,501,4.397849462365591
8380293,4,B002TMRGTU,I found this video effective in getting a Lean Intro class from a service based company to understand the 7 wastes.,1403395200,,115,4.523809523809524
8380294,5,B002TMRGTU,This is the single best introductory explanation of Lean I have seen. I've used this video in many Lean training events I have run because non-practitioners can relate to it.,1391731200,,174,4.833333333333333
8380295,5,B002TMRGTU,"I have used this video to teach lean principles to non process improvement professionals. It looks like a home movie and the cinematography is very amateur, but the content is great and the toast example just works in a classroom setting, I highly recommend it.",1387929600,,261,4.822222222222222
