8444864,5,B004WBZUSK,"I wish that they would bring the animated series back.  I really enjoy how they have fun with the Anne and Felix relationship through the animated series, especially on the very last disc which is volume 9.  A walk in his shoes and A better mousetrap shed light on some of the comical moments of the relationship.  I enjoy how Anne tells Felix,  ""You don't have an ounce of romance in your soul,""  Of course,  that's why she's there, hahaha.  If you're the person who watches kid shows for the show and not so much for the relationship,  then this is still very good, but I still wish they would bring it back to tv.",1360281600,,616,4.2956521739130435
