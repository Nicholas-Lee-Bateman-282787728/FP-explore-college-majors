The story is a parody of the Japanese spirits and their behavior, and if you enjoy that kind of thing, you will love it.  You will love it big time.

If you like well told stories, or feel that cultural touchstones have value, you might not like this story.  The complications of a human ""doll"" who never really does anything except prove that you can make the main character boring, of the display of old iconic figures as a couple of cans short of a six pack, and crafting bad behavior and marginally close to illegal actions into a laugh about history and culture-- I just did not care for it.

Like ""Disaster Movie"" and the piles of badly done parody movies, this one appeals to a small subset of the viewership.  If you love bad parody movies, this will take a place of honor.

If not, well, you have been warned.",1533686400,,884,4.321212121212121

8745457,5,B019KDX7UW,"So when this first came out I saw a few gifs, and it seemed like it'd be a passable goofy show. Man, was I wrong. Not only is this show hysterical, but it also has a lot of heart and gets pretty deep (like Mushishi deep). The show starts off sucking you in with the humor, but it slowly lets these really heavy and heartfelt moments sink in. This show never got much attention, but it is worth supporting. It was easily my second favorite show when it was airing on Crunchyroll, and something I still think about. If you want something that will make you laugh, cry, and then laugh again this is the show for you.",1461628800,12,613,4.203389830508475
