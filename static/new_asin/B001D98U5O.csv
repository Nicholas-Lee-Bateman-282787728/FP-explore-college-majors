3527752,5,B001D98U5O,"""Blood Scarab"" is a really terrific homage to classic monster movies and vampire films!  It is definitely the best film famous cult movie director Don Glut (""Dinosaur Valley Girls"") has made to date!  Lots of creature feature action, awesome FX make-ups,  tons of vampire girls. . . . . with tasteful, erotic, full nudity. . . .and some surprisingly good CGI for a low-budget horror film.  The actors all do a great job, especially Monique Parent and Natasha Diakova.",1217030400,16,467,4.8734177215189876

8292359,3,B001D98U5O,"The third and final entry in Donald Glut's lesbian vampire trilogy centers around the widow of Dracula attempting to become immune to sunlight through Egyptian rituals.

This is the best of the films in the series so far. The lighting, picture quality and the effects look better, aside from some shoddy CGI. The sets used for the flashbacks to Egypt in particular looked very good for a low budget film. I noticed a bit of improvement in the nudity/sex scenes to. They fit more into the plot, feel more erotic and less drawn out and sleazy this time.

Unfortunately one of the main problems from the first two Countess Dracula movies still remains which is the bad acting. Monique Parent manages to pull of a decent performance but most of her fellow cast members leave a lot to be desired. But for b-movie standards it is adequate I suppose.
Dracula is barely in it and didn't do much for the movie. They could've might as well left him out of the movie entirely. But I guess they needed something to motivate the Reinfeld character.
The mummy doesn't do much either. Aside from at the beginning and the end it mainly stands still in it's sarcophagus throughout the movie.

Overall, it is a decent film if you take it for what is; A soft-core comedy about lesbian vampires.
It is to bad Donald Glut decided not to make any more films in this series now that it's starting to improve. Hope he changes his mind as good movies about sexy vampire girls are hard to come by these days.",1346457600,3,1482,4.522388059701493
8292360,1,B001D98U5O,this was a disappointing vampire movie- amateurish and not very scary. the cover art is about as scary as it gets,1302912000,,113,4.428571428571429
8292361,5,B001D98U5O,"If you need an escape for an hour and a half, and love female vampyres like i do, watch this movie. Very entertaining. Love this movie,One of my favorite movies.",1265068800,2,161,4.4
8292362,4,B001D98U5O,Frontline Entertainment does it again with Blood Scarab.  The company that mixes beautiful woman and reasonable story lines has hit a homerun with this retro- 70's horror funfest.  In this outting they join their two biggest story lines; The Mummy's Kiss and Countess Dracula.  It reminds me of the old movies where Dracula would meet Abbott and Costello or Frankenstein would meet the Werewolf.  The main difference is a bevey of beauties who are a feast for the eyes.  There are some fairly good jokes as well.  Worth a look!,1233878400,4,527,4.8
8292363,3,B001D98U5O,"I've seen other reviews like ""Don Gluts best film"". Considering what he's done this isn't saying much.
However this film is not all that bad. The plot is interesting as they combine two streams of films already made, the ""The Erotic Rites of Countess Dracula""/""Countess Dracula's Orgy of Blood"" and the ""Mummy's Kiss"" films into one film featuring one lesbian vampire played by Monique Parent (as Countess Elizabeth Bathory) and who's still nice to look at, and a mummy, played by both a guy wrapped in bandages ""Bruce Barlow"" as well as a cursed ancient Egyptian lesbian that they have flashbacks to. And they thrown in B-grade veteran Brinke Stevens as a professor which is totally unbelievable.

There's a lot of topless lesbians in this. But this is where the film falls down. They're so wooden as to completely ruin the sensuality of the moment. Even when the Countess is preying continually on the bosom of her victim Mina (Natasha Diakova) who seems  caught between playing aroused and playing bored. Monique Parent seems like a graduate from the Actor's Studio by comparison.

There's a moment when the Countess meets Mina at Mina's home and she is standing next to her victim. We see only Mina's reflection in the mirror. There's no reference to this by either character and as we already know the Countess is a vampire I can't see why they have that `special effect' shown.

There's dancing topless lesbian spirits which is a poor tribute to scenes from Joe Sarno's 1973 Vampire work ""Der Fluch der schwarzen Schwestern"" (also known as ""Veil of Blood""). The reference isn't hard to spot given that the director appears in his own film as Mr Sarno.

Del Howison, who was annoying as Renfield in two previous films returns to accidentally kill off his master (Dracula) in this film and continue to annoy throughout.",1232409600,5,1823,4.84887459807074
8292364,5,B001D98U5O,"I wish Don Glut would make more movies; each one is better than the last. This one, BLOOD SCARAB, is a merger of the ""Countess Dracula"" and ""Mummy's Kiss"" series and brings both to a surprising (perhaps) conclusion. Or, at least, things will never be the same.

Don's movies never overdo the gore and always deliver the eroticism we always had to imagine for ourselves in the days of CREATURE DOUBLE FEATURE. And they never skimp on plot or character. If you want to trip back to the days of Drive-Ins, Aurora model kits and FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND, this movie (and the others in the series) are for you.

Del Howison reprises his role of Rennie from the ""Countess Dracula"" movies in BLOOD SCARAB. I've always loved both the actor and the character and I was happy to see him have a role in this one that he could really sink his teeth into.

Very enjoyable all around. Highly recommended.",1219795200,5,893,4.53416149068323
8292365,5,B001D98U5O,I saw this film at a special screening in Las Vegas. I can tell you that Dracula is no longer in the horse and buggy(carriage)era. Don Glut has done a great job of modernizing this classic tale.,1218758400,3,194,4.27027027027027
