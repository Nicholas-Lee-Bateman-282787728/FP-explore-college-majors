8006577,5,B000154000,These are the most incredible DVDs! I learn so much every time I view them. I will be using these for a long time to come. I highly recommend this set. Also what a great savings!!,1170892800,,179,4.0
8006578,5,B000154000,"These DVD's by Master Alexeander are exellent. I have collected many Jujistu series on VHS and DVD and this 9 disc set is my favorite. I think that a person can get a great deal of material from watching these discs, and if that person is in a school and can ask his/her teacher questions about the material then that is the best way to go. A person could watch the dicss and try to learn without a teacher, but it would be better to have a teacher's imput. Every disc has played and they are good quality, exellent material. Buy these.",1136073600,3,536,4.264705882352941
8006579,5,B000154000,"Let me start by saying that before I wrote this review there were 6 other reviews already posted. 4 people gave the product 5 stars and 2 people gave it 1 star. Of the 2 that berated it, one didn't even buy the product, obviously because he was too cheap to make the purchase. Some people...

  Anyway, the other poor review talked about poor quality, skipping, etc.. I have absolutely no idea where he's coming from because my set is PRIMO!

  Listen up- I pay 100 dollars every month for my son and I to study Jujitsu from a qualified master and we haven't scratched the surface of what is on this set. I mean to tell you that this set ROCKS!!!

  I hope that you don't buy it, that way I'll be able to kick your hiney all over the mat the next time we spar. Get the picture?",1109980800,3,777,4.126666666666667
8006580,5,B000154000,I bought this set and I have been blown away at all of the information contained in this set. Everything from grappling techniques to the basics all shot with some beautiful footage and great explainations as to how the techniques work. Awesome!,1089763200,,245,4.857142857142857
8006581,5,B000154000,"WOW! If this video set had any more information about Jujitsu.well, I don't
think it could. You want to know Jujitsu, then I highly recommend you buy
this set. Very good presentation, highly informative and the best techniques
I've ever seen.",1089158400,3,242,4.926829268292683
8006582,5,B000154000,"I agree with the last reviewer... this set is awesome and very comphrehensive. The instructor featured is well known to me  and has been featured in several well known martial art magazines including Black Belt. Guess the reviewer""under the rock"" hides there because this person doesn't have a clue. This is a fantastic complete instructional series. I highly recommend this set. If you want to see the style in action check out the UFC on June 19th.",1086825600,2,450,4.8441558441558445
