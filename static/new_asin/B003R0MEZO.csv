4172477,5,B003R0MEZO,"The 11th season of CSI is very good. During the 22 episodes we have fun, action and good investigations. In the episode 13 (""The Two Mrs. Grissom""), William Petersen is back but uncredited, in episodes 14, the Ex-Wife of Langston appears and she's back in episodes 20, 21 & 22 with the ""Dick & Jane"" killer... So, If you're addicted to this show this season is for You !!!",1306281600,10,372,4.405797101449275
4172507,4,B003R0MEZO,"Over the past few years, I have been collecting the entire CSI: Crime Scene Investigation series on DVD, and over the past few months, Ive been watching each season in the order they were broadcast. Recently, I finished Season 11. While I thought it was very good, I don't think it was quite as stellar as previous seasons.

Most of Season 11 revolves around the confrontation between CSI-2 Ray Langston (Laurence Fishburne) and the Dick-and-Jane serial killer Nate Haskell. Haskell is a notorious psychopath responsible for at least 18 grisly murders, and possibly more. He escapes from captivity at one point, forcing a major manhunt by the Las Vegas Police and other law enforcement agencies. I won't give away how (or even whether) the manhunt ends, but suffice it to say the episodes involving the Haskell-Langston confrontation are suspenseful, tense, and very well written and acted.

Other episodes are very good as well, especially The Two Mrs. Grissoms, which brings Sara Sidle (Gil Grissoms spouse) into conflict with Gil Grissoms mother during the investigation of a murder on a college campus for the hearing impaired. Other outstanding episodes include 418/427, about the murder of and FBI agents wife and the kidnapping of his children; and Sqweegel, about a killer who leaves no evidence behind when he murders people with secrets to hide.

I found some episodes in Season 11 that were not quite so enjoyable. They include Blood Moon, about a killing at a convention of vampires and werewolves; and A Kiss Before Frying, about a series of electrocutions that may be linked to an old Las Vegas murder, while Greg Sanders falls for a mysterious woman who visits the lab. These episodes I felt had contrived plots and lacked interest.

Overall, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Season 11 was good, but not great. It certainly is a worthwhile addition to any DVD collection. Recommended.",1507766400,,1897,5.031847133757962

I never did understand Fishburne's character and how it added to the mix.  He's awesome but it felt that his part never fleshed out.  The stories always were fascinating even after so many years.  I think it ended appropriately.  Just buy it, sit down for the long haul, and enjoy.",1500508800,,428,4.341772151898734

4172826,5,B003R0MEZO,"I just finished watching season 11 of CSI Las Vegas and it is at the moment my favorite season.  I gave it 5 stars because of the
excellent (and very creepy) later episodes; particularly the ones concerning Nat Haskell.  I thought Fishburne was at his best in this
one.  I loved him in the MATRIX trilogy and he has been good in the earlier episodes, but he just got better and better as the seasons
rolled on.  I did not think anyone could replace Grissom, and they didn't, but he came in and took off.  His chase down of Haskell
was terrific though I might have tortured the monster before wasting him.  Haskell was sort of a combination of Perant (BONES) and
Charlie Manson.  Similar characteristics such as attracting weirdo women (of course that was in Las Vegas, a weird town) and
getting them to do his dirty work much like Charlie.  Unfortunately Charlie was a real sadistic killer and Haskell a writers imagination
but still extremely creepy.
  Then too, there was the case of Dr Jeckel, another weird serial killer  running about in a no. of episodes.  Gruesome!  Anyhow,
salute to Fishburne and to the cast of writers who did so well this season.
  I  thought the episode about ""fracking"" was interesting though I was a little uneasy about whether the producers were knocking
fracking or just criticizing the corrupt energy company.  I am a big booster of ""fracking"" and other energy research methods that
can make us independent of foreign energy supplies and yet keep costs to the consumer reasonable.
  Anyway, a good season for those who like action, forensic sci research and putting the bad guys away.  I certain recommend
it and like all my DVDs, I got this set from Amazon.  I still have 12 & 13 to watch.  And as always the entire cast is good; I am
even getting to like Willows, though she seems to be having trouble with her boyfriend; I actually saw her smile once.  And I
certainly like her better than that creep Dr Sweets or Martha from you-know-where.  Enjoy!!",1407456000,,1987,4.611428571428571

The interation of the characters is what fascinates many of us and keeps us coming back.  Please note:  by educational, I mean, for someone who has no crime solving knowledge and has never studied this.

The subtitles/captions were not available when playing them on stand-alone DVD players. Starting with Season 11 of CSI, closed captions can be selected on DVD players. For myself, and I figure many others, this is a big deal not having to hook up a PC to the TV in order to watch a DVD with captions.

 I wish reviews for all DVDs would indicate whether CC is accessible on player devices or required a PC instead. This is even of more importance now that in Windows 8, Windows Media Center is an add-on for a fee, rather than included in the operating system.

4173049,1,B003R0MEZO,"First, I want it on the record that I have nothing but contempt, disrespect & loathing for that Canadian baby Justin Bieber. I cannot believe that little brat invaded my show. That being said, I will not take away what a BIG name he is & even he should have done commentary on the Season Premiere SHOCK WAVES & TARGETS OF OBSESSION. Bieber joined the ranks of Faye Dunaway, Liev Schrieber, Ned Beatty, Ruby Dee, James Whitmore, Peter Stormare, Jewel, where a BIG name gets no motice on the DVD. That routine BIG name ignorance brings us to POOL SHARK, with Elliott Gould. You cannot deny his impact on film & television. Elliott Gould found himself in the same season being slighted the way Bieber was. POOL SHARK also was the return of Drops & just like P0PPIN TAGS(6), BIG SHOTS(7) & DROPS OUT(8), Method Man was not called in toe record commentary. POOL SHARK also had a surprise return of Wendy Simms(Liz Vassey in her final episode) where she & Hodges discussed his failure in not sealing the deal as far as a romance was concerned. Where the f()<k was the commentary from Gould, Method Man, Holly Madison, Vassey & Wallace Langham? POOL SHARK also revisited Sam Braun & POOL SHARK still got nothing.

FRACKED touched upon the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing used to harvest natural gas & drill for oil at the same time. So FRACKED followed suit with UNFRIENDLY SKIES(1), ANATOMY OF A LYE(2), AFTER THE SHOW(4) & I LIKE TO WATCH(6) in being a ripped from the headlines episode that gets dick on DVD.

THE 2 MRS. GRISSOMS-do I really need to spell it out for you? Fine, I will. We meet Grissom's mom Elizabeth who's stone deaf, we meet Julia Holden, Grissom's ex-girlfriend, we see Sara being treated with contempt by Mama Grissom. We see Sara having Julia shove their relationship in her face. Marlee Matlin-BIG name, no notice. Phyllis Frelich was also spectacular as Elizabeth Grissom. We also had the first physical appearance of Grissom since 1 TO GO in Season 9 albeit via Skype. Character development, BIG name, the return of C.S.I.'s star, no commentary on this is inexcusable. Marlee Matlin CAN speak, as for Frelich I don't know, but their commentary could have been converted into text to be read on screen. JorJa Fox was also needed. I want Carol Mendolsohn to explain to me like a child using simple words how this did not get commentary.

TUNE IN, TURN OUT, DROP DEAD was an episode loaded with gallows humor & the comedic goldmine that is Howard Hesseman.

THE LIST, another Brass polishing that quickly tarnished by not getting commentary. We lost the much beloved Sam Vega played with masterful craft by Geoffrey Rivas. It was heartbreaking to have Vega commit suicide. Where was the commentary from Paul Guilfoyle & Geoffrey Rivas?

HITTING FOR THE CYCLE-another humorous gem that was as brilliantly executed as TOE TAGS in Season 7.

UNLEASHED-the return of Lady Heather, the only time Lady Heather appeared without Grissom, with Langston, where Langston himself found fascination with our favorite retired dominatrix. MELINDA CLARKE SHOULD HAVE RECORDED COMMENTARY ON EVERY LADY HEATHER EPISODE!!!!!! Try to say otherwise to me, I double-dog dare ya.

FATHER OF THE BRIDE-Langston's ex-wife is introduced along with her new husband who find themselves targeted by Nathan Haskell. Bill Irwin neither being interviewed nor called in for commentary is SHAMEFUL!!!!! Haskell was easily C.S.I.'s mosst diabolical serial killer. Haskell is the very person responsible for giving then taking Langston away from us. Theirs was a symbiotic relattionship & together Irwin & Fishburne never were interviewed together, never did commentary together. Bill Irwin was reduced as an actor by not getting any attention paid to him on the DVD again despite being what brought to & later removed Fishburne from the series. FATHER OF THE BRIDE also brought back Sofia Curtis who had not been seen since GO TO HELL in Season 8.

CELLO & GOODBYE-more fodder for the Haskell storyline & like HOLLYWOOD BRASS, brought Las Vegas to Los Angeles. The introduction of Morgan Brody, Ecklie's daughter, Langston having the law put HIM under a hot light. We also met Haskell's father Arvin Thorpe. In the Season Finale IN A DARK, DARK HOUSE, we learn Haskell's real name was Werner Thorpe, we learn young Thorpe killed a door-to-door salesman named Douglas Nathan Haskell & Thorpe assumed Haskell's identity. What made Werner Thorpe Nathan Haskell was revealed. NEED I SAY MORE?! All this went into Season 11 & only 2 episodes got commentary. How can they justify charging the exorbitant price for the DVDs yet still since Season 8, barely phone in the content? Seasons 1 to 11 of THE SIMPSON'S, the seasons that aired BEFORE C.S.I. premiered, have commentary on EVERY episode. 13 in Season 1, 220 on the others. THE SIMPSONS pre-C.S.I. have commentary on a staggering 233 episodes, C.S.I. is in the dust with 48-counting Special Features relevant to a particular episode. THE SIMPSONS on those seasons alone have over 5 times as much commentary.",1365724800,,5052,4.921361502347418

4173085,5,B003R0MEZO,"This season picks up from season 10's cliff hanger. I would say the last 3 seasons would be referred as the Nate Haskell/Dick & Jane saga. The only downside to this season is it continues into the 12th season, but it closes the DIck and Jane killer story.

Some featured episodes that stood out to me were:
-'Sqweegel' was about a forensic-proof serial killer. This could have easily been into a CSI movie due to how original and detailel it was in the series.

-'House of Hoarders' only because I know the rise in interest with viewers with shows like Hoarders: Buried Alive or Animal Hoarders.

-'The Two Mrs. Grissoms' was a different way of solving crimes when Sara going to a scholarship foundation for the deaf when a car bomb goes off.

-'Unleashed"" which involves a woman getting mauled by a mountain lion and another case with a pregnant 17 year old who is harassed by cyberbullying.

-The last three episodes are back-to-back in a cat and mouse game between Dr. Ray Langston and Nate Haskell.

Some recurring or guest appearances in this season is Justin Bieber (2 appearances), Dita Von Teese (1 episode), Gil Grissom makes 1 appearance as well as Lady Heather.

As for the episode itself, I barely ever understand the scientific stuff and though the story was good, it would have been nice to see the major bad guys get taken down. They didn't even show them.

The interviews with the series' stars and showrunners are treasure troves of information, and it's fun to hear the actors' perspectives on various aspects of the season just completed. However, I was a little disappointed with the actor interviews for season 11, because there were no interviews with Laurence Fishburne. I would've really liked to hear his views on the whole Nate Haskell storyline and the dark depths of his character, Dr. Ray Langston. Other than that, the special features in this season 11 set were very enjoyable. The one about ""Walking with Dinousaur"" was especially delightful, but the one about Sqweegel is not for squeamish! The writers talked about how they came up with some of the stories. But the best of the special features was the actors talking about the evolution of their characters and how they've changed and grown over the years.

4173226,3,B003R0MEZO,"CSI was a great fun TV show to watch. And I was with it until season 10. But when William Peterson left that was it for me. It was his show. And he made it a great show. With him showing back up a bit. Maybe CBS got it. He needs to be back.
I will keep my eyes on it a bit more. Hope he starts to show up more and more...",1314403200,4,321,3.410958904109589

And a 3-part finale, never done before and it was better than ever.",1312329600,15,277,4.148148148148148
4173228,5,B003R0MEZO,"Eleven seasons down and this show is still going great! It's not the same show as it once was in the days of Grissom (William Petersen) but the cast is strong and the stories still worth watching.  For fans of the show, this set is a must have.  Overall, the episodes of season eleven were closer to the early seasons in terms of quality.  The show hit some lean times in terms of believability and quality a couple of seasons back, but seems to be hitting it's stride again.  May the show continue for many more seasons to come!",1311811200,20,529,4.313131313131313

8402851,5,B003R0MEZO,"Top of the heap episodes. Brilliantly watchable! It's also the first season CBS has deigned to include actual subtitles on the disks (they only had the old school ""CC - Closed Caption"" in previous seasons, and despite what anyone might tell you, those simply do not play FROM DISK on the newer HD TVs - at least my Sony and my Samsung Ultra.

One caveat - I personally detest the Nate Haskell story line. Maybe it's just me, but even as a child I have resisted the narrative device of a super-villain. A bad guy no one can ever stop, who keeps coming back book after book (Sherlock Holmes' nemesis, Moriarty), movie after movie, TV episodes week after week, year after year, and in Batman and Superman comics. Even at age 7 I knew that no matter what the hero did, the bad guy would return. That always felt incredibly stupid to me, erasing whatever cool hero stuff was done. A very lazy way of trying for intense drama.

So with my personal idiosyncratic aversion to stupid 2-Dimensional, immortal super villains aside, Season Eleven has some really interesting and engaging stories - far beyond the pale. I just skip the 4 episodes with the creepy Nate Haskell character, and I am still immersed in 18 SUPERIOR TV shows!",1516406400,,1222,4.60091743119266
