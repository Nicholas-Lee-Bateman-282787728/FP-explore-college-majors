932898,4,6304773331,"What if there existed a document that could dismiss the transfer of Hong Kong from Brits to China? Rob Lowe plays Sean Dillon, a spy trying to gain  evidence of that secret on behalf of Britain. But, as he engages his  assignment, he is caught off-guard by a beautiful distraction, Deborah  Moore. Good flick for Rob Lowe. No James Bond, though.",967766400,6,345,4.622950819672131

7878052,3,6304773331,There are so many people who could have made this part better.  The dialogue left a lot to be desired.  The characters did not form as easily as they did in the book.  Jack Higgins is one of the best writers of my generation.  I wish the film version did more than just use his characters.  They didn't come to life as they did in the book.,1386374400,,340,4.014925373134329

7878054,2,6304773331,"The movie in and of itself aint bad as they say it is if you can only get past the fact that everyone is pretty much in character except the most important person and that would be Dillon. He has absolutely no Irish about him that we come to know and love in the books. Not even an accent,like I said everyone else in the movie is pretty much in character. As far as the book compared to the movie from the little bit I've seen the principle and the concept is there it may have deviated a little bit.

I couldn't finish it because like I said Dillon aint Dillon

Skip this as it is a total let down to hardcore fans like myself. Its more of a collectors item than anything. Casual fans may like this movie. I have mixed feelings about it but most of them are negative.",1226275200,3,769,4.086092715231788
7878055,1,6304773331,"When I received On Dangerous Ground from Amazon I discovered that the shrink wrap had been carefully slit at the top.  Upon opening the case I further discovered that the DVD was actually a copy and not the original DVD.  I would have expected such a possibility from the individual sellers that do their business through Amazon, but not Amazon itself.  I have returned the DVD for a refund and will now order it through AmazonUK.",1180483200,4,430,4.631578947368421
7878056,4,6304773331,"For those of you who have read the Jack Higgins Books, it is simalar to the book, but many differences.  It is a very enjoyable movie, but I believe the movie isn't as good as the book.  Rob Lowe as ""Sean Dillon"" isn't what Higgins makes him out to be.  I do recomend buying it, but don't think the movie will follow the book word to word, but it does follow the book's plot.  Dillon doesn't smoke or drink in the movie, like he does in the books.  Dillon, Asta, Fergouson, and Kim don't go hunting, hell Kim isn't even in the movie or the Prime Minister.  It is a good B film though, I just hope that they would make more movies based on Jack Higgins books, ones that follow the book very closely like ""The Eagle Has Landed"".  I would buy this movie if your a ""Jack Higgins"" fan.  Just don't buy it with high expectations thinking it's just like the book.  Close but not 100% like the book.",1122681600,5,891,4.16374269005848
