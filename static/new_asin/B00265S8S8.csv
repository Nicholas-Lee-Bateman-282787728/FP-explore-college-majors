8351966,3,B00265S8S8,I would consider this a more advanced yoga. It was very fast moving and I couldn't quite keep up with how fast she went from one position to the next. If you're advanced you'll probably love it. If you're a beginning I would look for something else.,1467676800,,249,4.319148936170213
8351967,5,B00265S8S8,"Loved this video. Great workout 2nd and early 3rd trimesters. Too much for my poor late, 3rd trimester body.",1454976000,,108,4.7368421052631575
8351968,3,B00265S8S8,"Great workout, but some of the moves were awkward even at 23 weeks. Needs a little more relaxation at the end.",1355097600,,110,4.285714285714286
8351969,5,B00265S8S8,"I bought this DVD for my wife a couple months after we found out she was pregnant.  We've used yoga DVDs from this company before, and have really enjoyed them so I thought it would be a great gift for her.  She loved it, and used it all the time. It was a great way for her to relax and work out, especially later on in the pregnancy.  A lot of the physical pains that she experienced during her first pregnancy were either less noticeable or gone this time around thanks to this workout.  My wife has shared it with many of her girlfriends that have also had children, and they have thanked her for it.  So whether your a woman expecting a child or a man that wants to help your wife out I would really recommend this DVD.",1325980800,,724,4.142857142857143
8351970,5,B00265S8S8,"I am 10 weeks pregnant and when I can't get out of the house to my prenatal yoga class, Yoga Pulse is the next best thing!  Anastasia, the creator of Yoga Pulse, is a very knowledgeable teacher and her video is appropriate for both beginners and advanced practitioners.  Each posture is given with great detail and a thorough explanation of why each pose is beneficial during pregnancy.  They are designed to create balance and harmony within a pregnant body, while strengthening, stretching and alleviating many pregnancy discomforts. Also, I really enjoy the positive affirmations that are repeated throughout the video.  I highly recommend this video; it makes you feel good from the inside out.",1263427200,2,698,5.0964912280701755
8351971,4,B00265S8S8,"Pros:
The 45-minute length of the workout is long enough to get in a good, challenging workout without taking all day.
Instructor is pregnant herself and is the lone instructor with a voice over (some workouts have a single non-pregnant instructor, which I think is kind of annoying.)
She goes through modifications you can do and also tells you which poses should and shouldn't be done near the end of your pregnancy based on what position your baby is in.
Some really good stretches and poses I haven't seen in other prenatal workouts (like cobra with a bolster)

Cons:
Thick accent and flight-attendant like cadence are distracting at first.
All the 'green light of the yoga pulse zones' is pretty cheesy, but easy to ignore

Bottom Line:  not my favorite workout, but I like it better each time I do it.  Probably not for those who have not practiced yoga before; it's somewhere between a beginner and intermediate level.  For similar and slightly more challenging workouts, I like South Beach Yoga and Prenatal Yoga Flow and for slightly easier workouts I like Mimi Solaire, Anna Getty, and Shiva Rea's workouts.",1252540800,5,1117,4.8578947368421055
8351972,4,B00265S8S8,Liked this DVD.  Thought she is very motivating with out being over-the-top.  Seems like exercises that you can actually do with out much stress on my body.,1248825600,,156,4.7407407407407405
