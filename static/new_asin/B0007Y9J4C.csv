8053919,5,B0007Y9J4C,This is not a part true and part made up for a good movie. This is a documentary that seems to tell the true story of Wild Bill Hickok. It's still fun to watch those part-true-part-madeup good movies but I'd recommend watching this too for a taste of reality.,1509926400,,259,4.3061224489795915
