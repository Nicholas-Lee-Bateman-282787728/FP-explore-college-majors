7997693,5,B0000AMKI3,"Where else are you going to find a film starring Rip Torn and Roberts Blossom. In this dynamic duo of character actors. ""Death Falls"" comes across as part thriller, part romantic triangle, and a little bit ""Andy Griffith Show"". The clueless deputy routine is ridiculously overplayed by Dennis Fimple. Throw in a completely unhinged Jeff Combs, and you have a film full of early 90s entertainment value  ""Death Falls"" is something to watch, the movie is NOT forgettable to say the least",1523664000,,485,4.914634146341464
7997694,4,B0000AMKI3,"In DEATH FALLS (1991), Dub Farley (Rip Torn- A STRANGER IS WATCHING, DOLLY DEAREST) and Mae Baxter (Beverly Garland- SWAMP WOMEN, NOT OF THIS EARTH, PRETTY POISON) await the return of their friend, Hals Johnson (Roberts Blossom- DERANGED), who has taken a trailer full of horses for sale. When he never comes back, money gets tight. In addition, the absolutely insane Lonnie Hawks (Jeffery Combs- RE-ANIMATOR, FROM BEYOND, THE FRIGHTENERS) and his imbecilic friend show up at Dub's homestead, demanding payment of a debt. Meanwhile, Johnson has been in the hospital, at the mercy of his nurse (Nancy Parsons- MOTEL HELL). In the interim, Hawks is certainly up to something. Dub visits Hals, and breaks him out... w/ style! Due to a comedy of errors, mixed w/ misunderstandings, and Dub's hair-trigger shotgun, the police are called in. Also, Lonnie and his pal have only gotten crazier, and more vengeful. Hals tells Dub just how bad off he really is, and the two set off for ""the falls"". Will they make it there, considering Hals' deteriorating condition? Can the sheriff and Mae get to Dub and Hals before a big city cop and his posse, including Lonnie Hawks, find them? When Hawks breaks away from the posse, the story takes a tragic turn. Sort of reminiscent of some of the movies released in the 70's, w/ it's mix of humor, buddy film elements, thrills, and some bitter irony...",1511308800,2,1383,4.839662447257384
7997695,2,B0000AMKI3,"Sad to say but true, after being an actor in a movie which started out with some potential alas finds itself a less than B movie. The director or editor or whoever decided to throw in unneeded bad language as well as some bad cuts.  Most of the actors, well known, faired well through the cuts...but one obviously did not.  Over-acting or bad-acting in this movie dropped it's potential to a less than acceptable flick.  Pity...it was fun to work with most of the actors and crew.",1210636800,,480,4.494252873563219
