1743982,5,B00006CY45,"Nadesico Is a relitively new anime to me, despite the fact that I bacame hooked on the genere waaaay back in 1963, with the NBC version of Astroboy.
Nadesico has to be one of the funniest, yet solid action animes ever made. Chock full of self-parody and gentle humor, It is one of the most beautiful old school animes out there, when animation was still done by hand, and not CGI. I truly like all the main characters, especially the Chibi navigator with the deadpan Spock like attitude. She seems to be the only one with any brains on this laughable ship of fools. :)
All and all, a must have for anime collectors.",1046736000,3,615,4.4035087719298245
1743983,5,B00006CY45,"The hero who became...an anime fan?
Yes indeed, Nadesico is definitely the most enjoyable anime series I've ever seen. So what exactly is Nadesico? Basically, it's a Mecha comedy. But in actuality, it's much more than that. Most comedies go for one kind of laugh. Some shoot for all kinds, but some of the jokes fall flat. I can honestly say that Nadesico is a brilliant show. It makes fun of EVERYTHING. It makes fun of Mecha anime, it makes fun of sci-fi, it makes fun of video games, it makes fun pop culture, it even makes fun of the fact that some of it's puns are totally silly. And seemingly EVERY joke is hilarious. Seriously. It would seem almost impossible that you would not find SOMETHING funny in this show (especially if you find the stereotype of a kid turned hero or a guy being chased by tons of girls funny). But wait, there's more.
Not only is this show hilarious, it also features great characters that (once again) know they are the stereotyped kind and have fun with it. The voices (even in the English dub) are absolutely perfect. They convey everything from serious drama to wacked out comedy perfectly without skipping a beat. And then there is the plot.
The plot may seem on the surface to be just a parody of all the Mecha shows that have come and gone in recent history. But look closer, and you'll find that the plot twists and turns as well as any. Seriously, when the story and drama kicks into high gear, I'd rank this show with Macross any day.
But, you may ask, is every episode the same thing? Mecha action and comedy? No, indeed. The variety in the episodes is truly staggering. You have TWO World War II themed episodes (one about tank battles, another about submarine battles), an episode out of chronological order, a standing in space episode, a talent show episode, and of course a showdown epsisode (to mention just a few). And every single episode is flawlessly executed. Even the review episode is a brilliant take on the episode reviews in all Mecha sagas.
And for what it's worth, the animation and music in this show are both EXCELLENT. Don't belive me? Just watch the into and ending. Sure, lots of shows have great intros, and lots of shows have great endings. But both?
All in all, this is one of the most brilliant shows I've ever seen. The only show I could maybe compare to it is the excellent CGI cartoon show ""Reboot"". In it's third season, it also features epsidoes with parody famous movies and pop culture, and it also has a great story, cool characters, and an awesome plot. If you love Mecha anime, you must have this show. If you hate anime, you still need to try it. It is very balanced show, and you're sure to find something to love. Yes, you've probably seen battles, animation, characters, and plot like this before. But in this world, there's no such thing as originality (or as Picaso said ""Good artists copy, great artists steal"". Nadesico makes no bones about it, they're stealing. And they're artists.",1043884800,38,2972,4.567415730337078
1743984,4,B00006CY45,"We've had epics like Grave of the Fireflies and Wings of Honneamise.  And we've had oddballs like FLCL and Utena.  But Nadesico just feels so familiar; a fan-favorite with many, many winning formulas.
The plot is basic, but it never fails to keep your interest, and it keeps on flowing until the end.  Carrying the seemingly simplistic story along is the characters.  It's one of the most solid, diverse and fun casts shown on screen.  Each crewmember has a distinct personality, and the chemistry between them is simply delightful.  They grow on you so much that even after the strangely open-ended conclusion at Episode 26, you still have a fuzzy feeling inside.
On the video and animation quality, the show holds up quite well.  Frame-rates show some slow-down during battles, but that's not attributed to the DVDs, and it's not jarring either.  The animation is in every sense average, and it keeps it's steady plod to the end.  Transfer is clear, but not pristine, and the last DVD, Endgame, has unusually warm coloring; whether it came from the source or the transfer, I don't know.
It's not mind-blowingly epic, or deeply philosophical (even though it does have it's share of dramatic sequences), but it's why (most of) you started watching anime in the first place.  So for any fans out there, it's one of the series where you just pop in DVD after DVD and hum the theme song as it plays.",1043798400,5,1396,4.731404958677686
1743985,5,B00006CY45,"If Cowboy Bebop is an easy way to get you into the anime groove, then ""Martian Successor Nadesico"" (pronounced like ""Nabisco"") is its complete opposite. Nadesico is a satire whose jokes are all inside. Watching this series without having a good anime foundation and a love for its goofy humor is like watching ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" without ever having seen a Jay and Silent Bob film.
Nadesico is anime as contradiction. It takes brutal stabs at every anime stereotype. You have never heard girls in love whine as much as these. No other mecha pilot has ever not wanted to pilot a mecha this much. Anime plots don't get more convoluted than this one. Characters have never had bigger eyes or goofier outfits (or perkier body parts) or cheesier lines. Rarely, however, do characters have this much heart.
I didn't realize how much I liked these characters until one unexpectedly died. Nadesico manages to drive the anime standard to its most absurd limits and, at its center, remains grounded enough to keep interest high. It draws you in with laughter and keeps you there.",1043712000,13,1082,4.791443850267379
1743986,5,B00006CY45,"I bought this series mainly because I was looking for an enjoyable mech series and on the strength of the reviews I've read about it and ended up liking it even more than I thought I would. Nadesico is a series that has several of the elements I enjoy in an Anime, there's action, adventure, sci-fi and even some romance, all the time never taking itself ""too"" seriously and never above poking a little fun at itself. Without spoiling anything I'll say that I think the way the ending was done fit in perfectly with the rest of the series and I am looking forward to the eventual (hopefull) release of the Nadesico movie. I wish there was a way I could rate this series 4 3/4 stars. To me, 5 stars should be a rating reserved for something close to perfection. Nadesico comes very close.",1036972800,3,787,4.397260273972603
1743987,4,B00006CY45,"Providers seem to be getting the hint from the high sales of the Eva and Gasarki boxsets, so they've finally released the complete series of Nadesico. The plot we won't repeat, we're sure any fan site or other review will tell you more than you want to know - our advice is to buy without reading up on it.
The case itself is a bit of an enigma. Not just a box containing all of the dvds, this case composed of 3 double & 2 single cases moulded together. This makes a positive difference in terms of weight, space-saving and removes the worry that they'll fall out, but you do lose all that nice case art from the seperate dvds.
Without a doubt though, this is great deal taking the price into account. The quality is crisp and infinitely superior to vhs in terms of sound and picture. The one thing that we got annoyed over was Ruri's comment at the end of episode 26 ""some of those questions will be answered in the inevitable sequel."" But there is no sequel - just the Movie 'Prince of Darkness', which like most anime movies, only provides further questions.",1033862400,2,1062,4.395939086294416

1743990,4,B00006CY45,"Overview: Aliens known as the Jovians destroyed earth's base on Mars, wiping out its space fleets. Only one ship stands between Earth and total annihilation - Nadesico. A private company, Nergal builts Nadesico, a space battle cruiser to provide ""assistance"" to earth's military. Free from the military control, they had the free reign to assemble the most unusual crew for the mission. With a ace pilot who is also the cook and the commander of Nadesico, an admirals's daughter, things gets complicated. This new starship is the most formidable fighting vehicle ever built. However, before Nadesco can wrestle with the Jovian invaders, the crew must defeat their fellow humans as they elude the military's attempt to seize the Nadesico.
My $0.02: It may seems like a typical space sci-fi action anime but this series provides a lot of hilarious moments with an unusual cast of characters. Also the story thickens as the crew of Nadesico learns more about their alien invaders and how it's ace pilot was mysteriously transported to earth from Mars just before it was obliterated.
I enjoyed this anime mainly because it's funny and I like animes like Robotech. You will like it too if you like sci-fi mecha type anime with comedy and some parody.",1030406400,12,1245,4.961722488038277

 A word to the wise you need to always watch for people trying to pawn off illegal copies of this version. I myself was sent one and did not realize it until late in the game.

If you are not familiar with any other mecha shows it is still a good time.  The story and characters are off the wall right from the start, and then the story will grab your attention.  What makes this show sooo good is that while it will have you laughing till you cry at the beginning, the story actually sobers up and becomes generally good by the middle and end.  Definitely a show to watch with friends, and also a good one of the few shows that has a good English voice cast.
This particular set is a knock-off version with bad video quality.  But as this is an older show, and the visuals are not of particular importance it is worth the cheaper price than the 'official' version.",1269820800,,837,4.2993630573248405

1744045,5,B00006CY45,I'm just adding on to the other reviews - most are excellent! The story have a lot of twist and unexpect development that take you by the seat and keep you guessing about what will happen next. It start off looking like any other mecha shows but becomes more and more complex - it's tough to not reveal spoilers! It also showed the different sides of the battle - those who wants peace and those who want to wage war - even on their own side! There are a lot of reference material and pseudo science used in this dvd series - they do it in a interesting way that make it look like certain type of Japanese child's show (I don't have any idea which specific shows but this type of show have been used as a parody in a few other anime dvds) as they explain technology terms in a simple way that the general public understand but it's also funny as the characters dress up like either kids or bunnies! The movie The Prince of Darkness (not attached to the Complete Chronicles but need to be buy seperately) answer some of the questions that arise in the end of the dvd sequence.,1202256000,,1075,4.248780487804878
1744046,4,B00006CY45,"At the risk of trafficking in tired cliches, Martian Successor Nadesico has quite literally something for everyone: Cute girls (and let's be honest, guys too), humor, action, drama, and an intelligent storyline.  Plus mecha, of course, and lots of them.  What more could you possibly want?  It's probably not the greatest place to begin if you're new to anime, given the sheer number of references to other anime series and jokes about otaku culture; but honestly, most of these are so oblique that they'll pass unnoticed, particularly the talent competition near the end of the series, which is a parody of Macross (I didn't catch that one myself, having never seen Macross, or Robotech as it was called in the States).

To be fair, I can see how some otaku (translation for the uninitiated: fanatics) would find the show's characterization of otaku unflattering.  But to be honest, that's kind of the point; Martian Successor Nadesico is as much a study of otaku culture as it is a gripping story of political intrigue and space battles, but more than that, it's a chance for otaku to laugh at themselves.  Come on, admit it, you'd find cosplay bizarre if you were looking at it as an outsider.  I find Civil War reenactors strange, but I'm not about to try to stop them from doing it if that's how they want to spend their weekends.  And make no mistake, Martian Successor Nadesico would be hilarious even without the otaku references; my favorite bit from the first episode involves Akito catching a suitcase full of Yurika's panties with his forehead, and if that doesn't make you laugh, I have very little hope for you.  (In fact, come to think of it, most of the best jokes involve either Akito and Yurika's ""relationship"" or Mizumi's predilection for weird, inappropriate puns.)

All of this isn't to say that Martian Successor Nadesico doesn't have its flaws.  Every so often the plot seems a little confused about whether it wants to be funny or dramatic; it's not so bad as to make the show unwatchable, but it's definitely jarring when it does happen.  I also got the distinct impression that the writers didn't know how to wrap everything up in the final episode; as a result, the story stops dead and many loose ends go untied, particularly the meaning of the metal plate that a certain character drops near the end.  (Ruri passes a comment about the unresolved plot points during her end-of-episode narration, so it's possible this was done deliberately.  Or maybe it's just a cop-out and they really didn't know how to end things.  I'm gonna have to lean toward the latter on this one.)  But overall, I'd say that this is one series that every otaku needs to see at least once.  As is my wont, I watched each episode in English, then again in Japanese with subtitles, and I highly recommend this technique to get the full effect.  You'll get to hear Spike Spencer's spot-on performance as Akito and Kira Vincent-Davis' perfect deadpan as Ruri, plus you'll get to hear all the jokes as they were intended in the original Japanese.  (As much as possible, at least, because I'm quite sure that most of Mizumi's puns would be indecipherable to an English-speaking viewer if translated literally.)  Because, you know, that's what real otaku do.  Or so I'm told.",1188864000,,3272,4.76595744680851
1744047,5,B00006CY45,Martian Successor Nadesico takes place in the year 2196 where there is a war waging between the inhabitants of Jupiter called the Jovian Lizards and Earth. The main character  Akito Tenkawa is a boy with a mysterious past he was a pilot but is scared to fight so he becomes a cook he gets fired from his job because every time there is an attack on Earth he freezes up and then starts having like a panic attack. So heading home on bicycle he hits this car and the luggage attached to the car falls this girl and guy come out of the car and Akito starts helping the girl pick her stuff up. The Girl asked if they have met before and he says no after that she leaves and he finds a picture of a little girl and him as a kid and then realizes  that the girl is a friend he had on Mars when he lived there. He wanted to ask her something so he follows the car. To make a long story short she is the captain of a ship called the Nadesico and he becomes a cook/pilot of a robot called an Aestevalis. My review was probably boring but I can a asure you that this was just the some stuff that happens the first episode and that the anime is really funny has a lot of action and it's a Harem anime where almost all of the girls in the series like the main character.,1186185600,,1258,3.988095238095238
1744048,5,B00006CY45,"(SPOILERS INCLUDED!)

You know people, when I first started watching this show I thought that it would be just a very good parody, as most reviewers stated it.

True is that it mixes all sorts of stories and plots inside it: Comedy, drama, action, Mechas, science fiction, romance, an anime inside an anime (it is actually hard to explain but easy to understand once you watch the shows) etc.

At the beginning it is mostly a light-hearted show, making successfully fun out of everything and the main story resolves in three main axes: a) Humans and their forces fighting against aliens, b) Aliens fighting against humans and c) a private company that has the strongest space battleship and hired the craziest crew for this purpose, fights for humanity but has its own agenda. This is how the story mainly evolves till somewhere it reaches the middle of the episodes.

However, it starts to get very emotional and presents itself to have many plot twists such as: one side betrays the other, propaganda and manipulating the truth, political and military power games going on and romance evolving all around it. Not to mention the fact that the aliens proof to be humans as well.  People will die by sacrificing themselves for the ones they love and in times it gets very emotional if not dramatic at all.

Yes, the story - according to most reviewers - in my humble opinion, is much underestimated. You will see that it has a solid storyline, great character development and the message it brings across is LOVE (SPOILER!) and the love between the female captain and the Nr. 1 pilot of Nadesico is the one that will eventually safe everyone; and the series have a (bittersweet in a way) happy ending. Additionally, all the twists and questions will be answered in the end.

The animation is not bad at all: In order to get a good picture, imagine an animation that is a little bit better than the one that Evangelion or Cowboy Bebop had.

As for the opening - finish songs they are very good and you will love its music.

In my humble opinion, no matter what kind of anime fan you are, this show will definitely have something for you and you will love the series.

Is it worth buying it? I definitely will answer with a YES!

Either way, if you cannot afford the money for it than at least rent it because it is worth watching it.

Just keep in mind to watch the series till the end and then make your final judgment.

I hope that I could help in a way clarifying some things about Martian Successor Nadesico.",1149033600,5,2510,4.551111111111111
1744049,5,B00006CY45,"This anime is so funny, and just overall the best of the best! you should really buy the complete chronicles it will save you money.",1139702400,2,132,4.32
1744050,5,B00006CY45,"It seems as though anime these days is taking a turn for the worst with boring and unoriginal shows like Ghost in the Shell and Full Metal Panic. In my opinion, the golden year of anime was 1999. Why? Just look at a list of anime released during that year and you'll see why. A large amount of the most memorable anime came into existence and captured the hearts of otaku (anime fans) everywhere. And Martian Successor Nadesico was one of them. This show is just absolutely brilliant. Not only does it makes fun of old mecha anime with its series-within-a-series Gekigangar 3 (there's actually a separate movie you can buy devoted to the series), it also makes fun of itself by showing the characters from Gekigangar 3 watching Nadesico and discussing ways it could be better. It may sound corny to some, but to me, it's genius. If only every anime could be this good.

Another subtle joke in the episodes is a lot of yelling. If you know anime, then you know that a lot of them contain lots of yelling. While it may seem like a normal part of the anime (and it pretty much is), it's also sort of an inside joke to those who have watched other mecha anime like Gundam Wing. Although sometimes, even to a longtime fan like me, the yelling can get kind of annoying sometimes.

Also, the characters are very memorable. There's the traumatized young pilot Akito Tenkawa, who is reunited with his old friend Yurika Misamaru, an overstimulated nutcase of a girl who can't keep her mind off Akito. Her father is just as crazy as she is, often making comments on the fact that she is ""well-endowed"". Creepy, but disgustingly funny. There's also little Ruri Hoshino, a child prodigy who views everyone around her as idiots when their antics get out of hand. She's the favorite of many Nadesico fans, and I must say that I am one of them.

Overall, I give this anime a 10/10. This is definitely, as the review title says, one of the greats. One thing I forgot to mention, though: the music is excellent. It keeps the mood going in each scene and the anime would suffer greatly without it. If you're looking for a great, lovable anime to enjoy for years to come while the anime world loses its credibility, then you've found it.",1124668800,2,2217,4.509950248756219
1744051,5,B00006CY45,"As far as mecha anime goes, Nadesico is one of the most overlooked series out on the domestic market. Probably because it's one of the more difficult anime on the market to classify. The initial impression is one of a typical mecha show. Reluctant pilot with mysterious powers? Check. Alien invaders? Check. Pretty, but ditzy, main love interest? Check. Several other love interests? Check. Special super powerful new ship? Check. Wacky and strange ship crew? Check. But Nadesico takes all these elements and does more interesting things with them in parody than many shows do with them in deadly seriousness.

The characters mostly seem to be fairly flat and two-dimensional, but as you watch the series you really see that there's more to most of them than is readily apparent. There's generally not much growth, per se, but it's more of a realisation of things that had been there the whole time. The plot also seems straight forward, but there's a unique aspect to it that gets revealed as the series goes on.

Overall, it's hard to beat Nadesico for entertainment value. It's got action, it's really funny, it's got interesting characters, it's got a solid plot, and it's just a fun show to watch.",1108425600,9,1202,4.8585365853658535
1744072,4,B00006CY45,"There aren't many good sci-fi animes these days. But one I would recommend is Martian Successor Nadesico: The Complete Chronicles Collection Set. This anime series maybe in the 90s. But once you watch it, you can never get tired of watching it again & again.
With 26 episodes altogether, there are a dozen chracters you can remember. The epic tale of humans versus the jovians will surprise you with a twist. Then there is a craze anime within an anime that will bring forth the reason why the Jovians fight for. There is romance. There is comedy. And there is mecha fight scenes you will enjoy. Not to mention great music soundtrack that will keep you humming the tunes.
Cute, adorable, enjoyable by its own... this is a DVD Boxset you mustn't miss. Trust me, in my years on Robotech during the 80s... I never thought discovering Nadesico could be this addictive!

But be warned, it is also like Love Hina, Tenchi Muyo and the Excel Saga.  Love between characters, war between almost everybody and humor, some of it even picking on anime, makes the 650 minutes worth any price.  Plus tons of extras and WAY too many trailers.
The story is simple, at first.  The Jovians launch a attack against Mars, destroying mankind's outposts and blasting the United Earth Forces right out of space.  Mankind fights to defend the Earth and what they still control of the Earth's Moon, but the Jovians have a huge advantage in military technology.
The Nergal Corporation builts a super weapon in the form of Nadesico, crewed by wackos, misfits, anime fans and everybody who has the skills needed to run the ship.  They plan to rerun to Mars, to liberate it.
Then things get complex.  The Jovians MAY be on the RIGHT side,  the Nergal Corporation is not interested in librating anybody and the Earth government seems to be trying to hide something.
The characters, from the super-intelligent Ruri Hoshino to the brilliant, if somewhat unbalanced, Commander Yurika, all have funny AND serious sides to their nature.
The series asks tons of questions, about right and wrong, love and friendship, peace and war.  Even after 26 episodes, not everything is answered, but it does give you a lot to chew on. And laugh about.",1080259200,6,1447,4.775100401606426
1744074,5,B00006CY45,"To explain this anime would give away way to much of the story that makes this show so good.  The fact is this show comes close to being the most perfect show I have ever seen.  It has a plot so carefully laided out you shouldn't get lost but yet doesn't get boring and repetative.  The basic story of Nadesico is that the earth in under invasion by a mysterious race called the jovians and it is up to the crew of the most powerful battleship, the Nadesico, to stop the invasion.  This story is mixed with sexual inuendo and humor that doesn't bog down the story with a ton of depression.
Charecter development is a step above all other shows.  each charecter has their own reason to be on the nadesico and each one has their own personality.  You feel the pain of war in a way that makes you think how noble any war really is and to question what is important in your life.
The artwork done in the show is incredable.  you can think of it as a simplistic yet detailed style.  this gives way for the story to come out on top in this show.
In the end this show is the best I ahve ever seen and belive that it always will be.  even the most unenthuesed about anime can find something that they will like in here.  I highly recomend this show for everyone.",1077926400,,1254,4.16597510373444
1744075,4,B00006CY45,"Takes place in the future, the humans are being invaded by an alien race called, Jovian Lizards. Nedesico gets a bit more into the technological aspects of the story, which may confuse younger viewers. There are several episodes that explained the power behind the ship, Nadesico and its weaponry. The ship, Nadesico, is very advanced, it has an auto-defense system which kicks in if attacked. In one later episode I learned more details into the technology behind the ship. Aside from having a force shield, it ran on a new engine that caused a distortion field.  Nadesico operates on a type of anti-matter energy source and is capable of firing a Gravity Blast, a new type of weapon that other Earth ships didn't have. The ship also feeds power to the mechas  as they do battle; even though the mechas have their own battery power, the ship sort of ""transmits"" energy to power the mechas. If they strayed too far from the transmission area, they would loose part of their power and rely on their back-up batteries. The character animation and designs are beautiful to look at. The music and sound fx are also very good. This series is similar to ""The Irresponsible Captain Tylor"", but it is unique enough to set it apart. It does have a wacky crew, who are funny and cute. There are just a few flaws that prevent it from receiving a perfect rating... Akito, the supposed star of the show is so annoying, that I just wished that they had killed him off. Instead you'll get treated to his ear-popping screams. And he screams very often over the silliest things. What's worst is that since he is the supposed star, you get to see a lot of him in every single episode. However, during the rest of the show you'll enjoy mech battles, almost as good as the Gundam series, also spaceship battles and good character development. This anime overall is excellent, but not perfect, as the show is almost ruined by the moron, Akito. Good for all ages. Ends on 26. There is also the Nadesico Movie which takes place two years after the tv series left off.",1076976000,,2044,4.597260273972603

Even though it was complete i always want more than what they give, There is somthing veiwers should know that is not written anywhere i could find. The words D*** H*** and B****** are used often. well not really the last word i listed but the others are very fequent. other than that and a few sex things (nothing bad) it was GREAT.",1076716800,,469,4.164835164835165
1744077,4,B00006CY45,"If you loved the Macross series (or any mecha related anime) then I think you should do yourself a huge favor and watch Nadesico. Nadesico takes all the elements that made animes like that great... and makes a complete mockery of them. Join Akito, Yurika, Ruri and all the others aboard Nergal's ship the ND-001: Nedesico!
Naturally, it's a story about a war between the Earth and invadors from beyond Mars but beneath all that it's a story about  the meaning of friendship, being human, and why people who hate anime are always up to no good. Oh yeah, there's a very Tenchi-esque love polygon too...
Yes, for all you hopeless romantics there is a love story (even though it starts out as a very ridiculous one-sided love story) between Akito and Yurika that eventually involves most of the main female crew of the ship -_-*. It's pretty funny to watch even though some of the male members (not to mention Akito himself) don't find it quite as amusing as we do.
If that isn't enough, there is anime within anime as a lot of the plotline centers around Gekiganger, an anime that doesn't really exist but somehow has its own soundtrack. In fact, there is an episode where the cast of Gekiganger is watching Nadesico instead of the other way around!
You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll find out what becomes of anime fans when you banish them to a planet for a hundred years and leave them to their own devices... I urge you to buy this series!",1056758400,11,1438,4.552123552123552
1744078,5,B00006CY45,"Nadesico was fun from beginning to end.  From the messed up one-sided romance to the Geki-dom of the show, it was a hoot!  Ruri was great, I loved the episodes where it shows she has feelings as well, like when it shows her origins, that was a real treat.  I agree, not for beginners, you have to have a few anime series under your belt before watching this, but it is worth the watch, I guarantee!",1055203200,,398,4.2105263157894735

7967426,4,B00006CY45,"When most people think of anime, they think of a number of cliches that have defined the Japanese animation form for decades: giant robots, romantic comedy with hyper-expressive faces, or even cutesy creatures designed to sell toys and games. In the case of ""Martian Successor Nadesico""--for those curious, it's pronounced 'Nah-deh-sco', sort of like how one would say 'Nabisco'--it takes a good number of those iconic aspects of the medium.....And completely plays them for laughs. BIG laughs. It's almost as if the legendary Abrahams-Zucker Bros.comedy team, while on holiday in Japan, decided to take the magic that made hits out of ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"", and ""The Naked Gun"" and apply it to anime genres of all stripes. (Not as 'gag-a-minute' as those comedy classics, but still funny.) You name it, this anime (almost) has it all, with a MAD Magazine twist. Pilots in giant robots duking it out in the far reaches of the cosmos? It's there. More love triangles than an Archie comic? You bet there are. And the biggest laugh of all? Anime fandom's not safe from the spoofing, thanks to the show-within-the-show 'Gekigangar 3', a parody of the classic super robot anime of the 70's and 80's that's beloved by a number of characters in the series. If I were to liken this show to a specific American comedy series, I'd say it would be the anime equivalent of ""Scrubs""--both shows take established genres of storytelling (Nadesico and anime, Scrubs and medical dramas), and turn them on their heads in a number of humorous ways. (Now that I think about it, there's potential for a decent mash-up in the vein of the Family Guy/Star Wars spoofs.)
Like Scrubs though, the show isn't without its sense of drama and pathos, of course. The plot is very straightforward: in the far future of 2196, Earth's at war with the 'Jovian Lizards', and when the planet's main military forces are ineffective against the Jovian onslaught, industrial giant Nergal steps in to fund the design and construction of a new space battle cruiser, the titular Nadesico. The company also puts the ship's crew together, most of whom despite being experts in their particular fields possess some slight personality quirks. Our hero is Akito Tenkawa, a former resident of Earth's Mars colony Utopia who hates fighting and wants to be a chef, despite having some innate piloting skills needed to run an Aestivalis mech, one of the primary defenses of the ship. As a crew member aboard the ship, Akito deals with more than fighting alien invaders--he finds himself the object of affection for a number of the female members of the crew, including his childhood friend Yurika Misumaru, who also happens to be the ship's captain. Poor Akito--a good number of beautiful women throw themselves at him, and all he wants is to both hone his culinary craft and enjoy watching Gekigangar 3 in peace! (I bet Archie and Jughead would trade places with the guy in an instant.)
All in all, this is an anime that comes highly recommended, if only for the best way of describing it being the following one sentence:
""Fandom saves the universe.""",1496448000,,3104,4.891840607210626

The crew fights to protect humanity from the Jovians and have a little fun. This anime crosses over so many genres. Action, comedy, sci-fi, harem, drama, mecha, and romance. It's very broad. There are also tons of awesome characters. The characters are what make this anime so frickin great. This was one of the first series I ever bought; and over 200 later I still go as far as to call it a legend. You need this anime. I hope you love it as much as I do.",1350345600,,631,4.448275862068965
7967432,5,B00006CY45,"This is a series that really hits home for me. I took to watching Anime in junior high Martian Successor Nadesico was one of the series that really solidified my love for Anime. The story centers around the main character Akito, a member of a Martian colony that, be a random set of events, ends up a crew member on the space ship Nadesico (captained by his childhood friend of course). As the story progress we watch the ship get turned upside down as the crew continues its daily life (forming love triangles, battling aliens, dealing with near death situations...you know, that kind of everyday stuff).

For those of your that are into more modern Anime this may not be your cup of tea. For those of you that remember shows like  Rouroni Kenshin, Outlaw Star, and Trigun, then you'll feel right at home with the style of animation and voice acting that seems to have been lost in recent years.

Without giving too much of the story away, Akito and his childhood friend Yurika team up to fight the Jovian lizards only to find out that things are never so simple (what with the plot twists and all) and end up making the story twist and turn and end up one of those shows you'll never forget.

I said before I started watching Anime in junior high and this was one of the shows that really got me hooked, though sadly I never got to finish it (ironic considering Akito did the same thing with Gekigangar), though I have finally added to my collection (almost some 10 years later) and I couldn't be happier because yeah, its just that good.",1330128000,,1540,4.469750889679715
