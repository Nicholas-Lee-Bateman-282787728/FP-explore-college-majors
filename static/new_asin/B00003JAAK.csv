By the time I discovered it had been released in the UK (a year or two ago) it was already discontinued. The asking price by these online sellers is just outrageous! I see that here today, $90 to $291 dollars (it's just a rip off). As much as I love this show, I will not pay that. So, last month I was on Amazon UK and just happened to see ""The Best of Bette"" CD. It comes in two editions. The deluxe edition comes with a bonus DVD and to my delight, that DVD is the Diva Las Vegas Concert. I ordered it and paid $11 (yes, just 11 US dollars after conversion) including the shipping. It appeared that this CD may also have been discontinued recently. So I would check it out sooner then later. I hope this post saves someone a bit of money. Note that this DVD is also PAL/Region 2.",1461369600,,928,4.048913043478261

7918978,3,B00003JAAK,I had to get it converted on a DVD as it is a gift for my mom. The guy burning the DVD showed me that subtitles are on it and they cannot be taking off as it was made that way. If your not obsessive compulsive like myself then it's amazing! Picture looked great. But I was annoyed by the subtitles.,1384732800,,298,3.901639344262295
7918979,5,B00003JAAK,"The commerically available version of Bette's Vegas concert, The Showgirl Must Go On, is cut down to a tad over one hour and is missing some choice stuff. This disc has it all - but it's only viewable in Regions outside the US. I thought it was possible to view it on a DVD player that plays PAL (and mine does) but that turned out not to be true. The good news is, I can play it on my PC. And since I can hook the TV up to the PC, we're good to go!",1378166400,,449,3.736842105263158

7918981,5,B00003JAAK,"Dear Readers of this review this is to tell you about my experence with this.
 Purchase of my copy of Bette Midlers Diva LAS Vegas with the help of Amazon. Com.
 i had been chasing this DVD for some time but without any luck i received an e/mail
 from amazon.com and they had sent me some places where it was for sale the best.
  price for my wallet was a copy that was for sale second hand but with good write
  write up and the price to suit my wallet with postage etc in England i was at.
  first a bit uneasy about this as being 75 years old this was against my grain of
  trust in people these days but finally decided i trust amazon com. so lets go it.
  was amazing they kept me informed about everything and my DVD.arrived on the day.
  they said it would and play as if it was new. i can only say to all those Seniors.
  out there trust Amazon.com.and you will have no WORRIES THEY ARE GREAT.

  Best Wishes To All.

7918982,5,B00003JAAK,"Folks - Save yourself some money and go straight to the Amazon UK website.  With the exchange rate and shipping, it's a heck of a lot cheaper than what the used vendors are selling it for.  FYI - you need a multi region DVD player for this one.",1176768000,6,244,4.0625
7918983,5,B00003JAAK,"July 2010 UPDATE: AS STATED BY OTHERS, THIS DVD WAS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH REGULAR PLAYERS USED TO BE SOLD IN THE STATES BUT READ NOTE AT THE END; THINGS HAVE CHANGED...

Diva Las Vegas was produced in Germany (under PAL Format). DIVA was filmed during Bette's last two shows of her Vegas MGM Grand performance from 1995-1996. It is a MUST HAVE for all Ms. Midler's fans. A DVD was not produced or sold in the US because of her contract with Disney during those years.

Bette starts her show with a unique & typical of her entrance; coming down from the sky in a cloud. She then proceeds with the usual welcome and sings the expected oldies including the First Wife's Club, Bed of Roses, and other great classics followed by the regular Sophie Tucker jokes with more spice than usual (remember, it's Vegas). Next, an exquisite section on Burlesque; four terrific girls and only three costumes; yeap, someone's showing more than what expected. Vegas allowed it...

The second act starts with DeLores De-Lago; the wheel chaired mermaid who then decides to become a Home Shopping TV sales-woman [competing with Joan Rivers] and promoting her ""Balls"" to improve physical condition. You will be surprised on how Bette masters said balls. The section concludes with eight wheel chaired mermaids performing on stage at one time, singing New York-New York.

The show continues with a love song from her native Islands; Hawaii which prepares us for the grand finale singing the famous themes & love songs from Beaches, The Rose and the rest of her classic repertoire. It ends with the introduction of the orchestra, the back-up singers, the Harlettes and the great Bobby Lyle plus an unexpected and truly emotional ""encore"" of three songs.

Overall, the Divine Ms. M offers in Diva Las Vegas a much more sophisticated performance than on Divine Madness and a better production than Kiss my Brass (the 2005-2006 tour). The DVD sound is excellent and the picture surprisingly great for a PAL format. Diva compiles more than two hours of continued energy from the Divine Ms. M. This is a DVD that you will watch many times and will be proud it to show your friends, relatives & neighbors.

NOTE: If you do decide on getting this very expensive Germany produced DVD, buy an affordable programmable DVD player with Multi Region capability (for $30.00 TO $70.00 or so). You might have to change the region code from 1 (USA) to 2 [Europe] or to 0 [no region] following the instructions found on the Internet. Once accomplished, the device will play DVDs from all over the world including those from Japan, Spain, Great Britain and the US. Otherwise, burn the DVD into your computer HDD and watch the VOB version over & over. BTW, many current types of software allow you to burn VOBs into Disks. You can figure out the rest...",1149638400,19,2807,4.765432098765432

It is NOT a REGION 1 NTSC DVD, it is in PAL and compatable in Regions 2 thru 6!!  A TRUE Bette fan would know that this DVD has never been released to us here in NTSC Region 1 USA!!!

The ""1"" rating below is deceptive (especially since it is written in French). Their problem was the DVD wasn't compatible with their region, nothing to do with the actual content.",1136419200,4,299,4.555555555555555
