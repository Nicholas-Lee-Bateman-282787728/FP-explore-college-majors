8098482,5,B000CEX31C,A must have for anyone wanting to make the most of their venison.,1514073600,,65,4.076923076923077
8098483,5,B000CEX31C,"This DVD was purchased as a replacement for our old VHS version. It is a fantastic series and we found it so useful we have given it as gifts to friends several times.  As for us, we review it periodically to make certain we are getting the most from our wild game and are remembering some of the fine points that make things easier and better.  We mostly use the Big Game Field to Table section of the film series, but all of it is interesting and we learned some of the old ways from it.  Truthfully the recipes and style of cooking are not as useful to us (some are high fat) as the way Milos Cihelka explains processing white tail deer.  Before learning from this series 15 or more years ago, we thought we were making some fine venison products.  This series really upped our game, so to speak and are enjoying our venison harvests just that much more..  Highly, highly recommended.",1507161600,,887,4.378048780487805

8098486,5,B000CEX31C,If you like wild game for table fare then you need to get this video.  Chef Milos covers the material well and shows you how to make a safe and tasty transition from field to table.  Bon Appetite!,1400112000,,196,4.131578947368421
8098487,5,B000CEX31C,"Wow, very well done video.  This video is on task, with very little clipping, which never left me wondering what happened in between.

Chef Milos Cihelka walks you through every stage of handling game beginning after the kill and ending at the dinner table.  Every time I thought of a question he answered it knowingly.  Personally, I really benefitted from his detailed butchering, concerning silver skin, untasty fat, packaging for the freezer and seam separation.  His cooking insights were well beyond anything I was doing, but not in a busybody kind of way.  Just simple and thoughtful approaches which require a reasonable amount of time.  I think most outdoors people and those preparing wild game would benefit in some way from this video.

The only drawback is the sound quality isn't the best, but is very much in line with my expectations concerning cost of production and how that cost is passed on to me.  Interestingly enough every time he turned on a vent fan I could barely hear it, I was worried when he first mentioned it.

In the Amazon title description it says HD DVD, which I would never consider the quality HD after watching, but they may be technically correct as I am no expert.

One way to improve the video would be to include a recipe sheet or a link at the DVD menu for each recipe.",1389916800,,1312,4.636363636363637
8098488,5,B000CEX31C,"My wife bought this for me - I'm doing the review. Simply stated, I LOVE the videos. Outstanding instruction, well demonstrated technique, and excellent recipes in the series. Strongest possible recommendation. There has been a world of difference in our venison over the past couple of years since we got Chef Milos's videos. Processing takes less time and the meat keeps much better. My opinion is that any hunter who has limited experience at meat processing will benefit tremendously from these informative and entertaining videos.",1337904000,,535,5.305882352941176
8098489,5,B000CEX31C,"Today I viewed ""Wild Game, Field Care & Cooking"" and Milos Cihelka knows his stuff. I have dress out and cut up several dear and learned even more from this DVD. Anyone deer hunter who wants better tasting venison should view this. Milos has lots of great tips and it is easy to follow. I want to see more of his huntng and fishing DVDs.",1327104000,,337,4.2
8098490,5,B000CEX31C,"The Chef/Author really knows his stuff !! As a confirmed Foodie,I have high standards....and they were all exceeded by Milos.  It's rare to find a serious outdoorsman who is also a World Class Chef....almost all recipes were within the abilities of any serious home cook.......High marks all around",1262131200,,298,5.208333333333333
