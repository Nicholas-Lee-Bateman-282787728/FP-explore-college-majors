7949264,1,B00005OSJX,Just terrible. This is a terrible video which does not show any islands or beaches or anything else. It is just featureless satellite photographs with an accompaniment of empty piano music.,1340150400,,189,5.129032258064516
7949265,2,B00005OSJX,"Buy one of the Imax space dvd's , you'll be better off. This one is boring.

Unfortunately once you open the box, nobody lets you return it.

So you are stuck with it.

Spend your money on something else.",1144800000,,204,4.17948717948718
