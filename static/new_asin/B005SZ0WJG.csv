4887531,4,B005SZ0WJG,I've watched this entire series more than once and it is wonderfully fun. My only complaint is navigating the DVD's. You can't quickly access each episode and I always seem to get stuck in this irritating advertisement that's everywhere on each DVD!,1478995200,,249,4.9523809523809526

This was my first kdrama I had ever watched and it quickly became my most favorite. I am so glad to say that I own it now.",1478736000,,253,3.618181818181818
4887533,1,B005SZ0WJG,Poor quality.  Was suppose to have English subtitles.  When subtitles did come up they did not make sense and they appeared at random.,1477699200,,134,4.782608695652174
4887534,1,B005SZ0WJG,"Having made fun of friends who watch KDrama TV over the years, I was called out on it recently, and was forced to at least give it a try. Oh man, it's unbelievable how narrow minded I can be :P  It's been almost 2 months, and i'm already on my 7th show (and that's only because there's so many hours in a day...).  In any event, even though Boys Over Flowers has some annoying moments (the Contest and the Fashion Model Dude plot...bleh), I place it 3rd only behind Secret Garden and Coffee Prince, in terms of my fave KDRamas.

So, to discuss the DVD details.  The video is in 4x3 format, which is a HUGE strike against it.  Since i've already seen this on Viki in it's beautiful HD 720P widescreen format, this DVD is unacceptable.  I can't believe they would do that to this great show.  You will lose a lot of the environmental feel watching this in the cropped format.  I can't speak much for the music, as I was so annoyed with the 4x3 format, that I basically returned it without watching much more than a few sections.

I ended up searching for the YA version, which I fortunately found on eBay, albeit at around $230.  IMO, it was worth it, as you get almost the same version as you would on Viki (subtitles are a little different, but are still very good).  The music also seems to be similar to what you get on Viki, so i'm very happy with that as well, since some reviews suggest a different soundtrack depending on which version you get.  Since my gateway to KDrama is through Viki, i'm pleased that the YA version is very similar.

If you just want a copy of BOF to own purely for casual watching, then this DVD might be sufficient.  Since I love this show, I value watching it in it's true widescreen format, which is the only way to really enjoy it.  There are scenes where Jun Pyo's head and helmet hair, is in close up, and in 4x3 format, it just overwhelms the entire screen...it's not a good image.",1476835200,,1918,4.303621169916434

4887536,5,B005SZ0WJG,I love this story.  I wish they had an English voiced version!,1473724800,,62,4.166666666666667
4887537,3,B005SZ0WJG,"Boys Over Flowers is a really entertaining show. However, this DVD set (PMP version) has some issues.

Pros:
-It's Boys Over Flowers.
-It's on DVD, making it easy to watch anywhere without an internet connection.
-The price at $35 is not bad.

Cons:
-Lackluster subtitles with some errors. By ""lackluster,"" I mean the subtitles were very simple and straight-forward, and I felt like the dialogue lost a lot of its impact because of this. The other version I originally watched was different, and the subtitles were more dramatic and interesting. For instance, in this version when Jan Di has to grant Gu Jun Pyo a wish, he wants her to say I'm sorry (can't remember the exact phrasing), and she seems outraged. It didn't make much sense for her to be angry because she had already apologized. However, in the version I first viewed, he wants her to say ""I'm sowwy"" (again, can't remember the exact phrasing), and it makes more sense that she'd be mad at him since he wants her to do a simpering baby voice. There were other instances like this that stood out to me, too.
-Quality. The resolution is just not good. Again, the first version I watched was clear and high quality. This version is grainy and not great.
-Commercials. There are multiple discs, so you have to change them frequently, and it gets really bothersome to have to sit through commercials and other things at the start, and you can't fast-forward. They even have commercials before each episode, but you can at least skip those.

I'd recommend this if you want Boys Over Flowers on DVD, so you can watch it easily. If you don't mind just watching it online, I'd recommend that instead.",1473120000,,1655,4.680412371134021

4887551,5,B005SZ0WJG,"This production of ""Boys Over Flowers"" is the best romantic comedy I have seen in years and one of my all-time favorite movies.  Here are some pros and cons:

CONS:
Unreal plot situations (kidnappings, drownings, amnesia)
Unreliable subtitles
Two distracting subplots in the second half (Ji-hoo and Grandfather, Yi-Jung and Ga-eul)

PROS:
A great Cinderella story
Excellent writing
Jan-di, Jun-pyo, and Ji-hoo are complicated, interesting characters
Countless memorable comic and tragic moments
The actress who plays Jan-di (Ku Hye-sun) is phenomenally expressive, capable of showing emotional pain in more ways than I knew were possible, but also hilarious when she needs to be
Superb direction and music

If you watch the first episode and aren't yet hooked, that's okay, because the first episode is not all that great. If you give the second episode a chance, and then maybe the third, you will start to see the depth of the acting and writing, and you may find yourself hooked.  Don't worry -- it's okay to get addicted to this one.  It's really good!

(Note: We watched the DVD version because I understand the DVD version has a better original soundtrack than the Netflix version.)",1459728000,6,1188,5.092783505154639
4887552,5,B005SZ0WJG,"I first saw this on Netflix and loved it so much, I decided to browse Amazon and see if it was available. I'm delighted to report that this DVD set is better than Netflix - there is more than what Netflix shows!!! It's not completely different, but there's more dialogue between JanDi and Joon Pyo, the theme songs have translation (unlike Netflix, where you have no clue to the words of the songs) ...in general, it's more developed and really draws you in.  It's a great story, one that can be enjoyed again and again.",1459555200,,520,4.473684210526316

What it is is stunning. His character is complicated and he draws you in. These are all beautiful actors. The story line great. You laugh more than you cry. We all just loved this k drama.

4887577,5,B005SZ0WJG,"WHY oh WHY am I so totally taken in by this foreign melodrama?  Like an emotion junkie, I've watched and re-watched these episodes, taught myself the songs on the piano, skipped around to favorite spots and and bought the DVD.  I feel like I need to watch it again just so I can count up some of the crazy stuff, like how many times Jan-di gets rescued.  It's a good thing these kids are fictional.  I'd really fear for their success in relationships, as they have TERRIBLE communication skills.  Never speaking up when an explanation would be simple, always jumping to conclusions.  If they'd just learn to communicate somewhat normally they'd save themselves so much pain . . .  BUT I guess there wouldn't be a movie.  Oh, and I hope Koreans are better kissers in real life.  Korean kissing scenes are always disappointing.  Movie Director:  ""Okay, now just BARELY touch your lips to hers  and . . . .FREEZE!  Don't move those lips!  Now hold it! Hold it!  Hold it!

Not only is this offer cheap, but the delivery was as promised, I didn't have to wait long for there to be a ringing at my doorbell signaling that the package was here. The quality of the gift was good. The set came in a thin plastic wrap to protect it from scratches (which is really useful). Though I myself didn't get a chance to open the wrapping since it had to be wrapped for as a present, when my sister opened it she was overjoyed and together we got to open it.

There was no damage to the cover, and i found the inside adorable as their were pictures from the drama and each character had their own little section with their description on the sides. No CD was scratched which I am relieved to say. The only thing that felt a bit off was that at first glance, they make it seem like there is six discs instead of five since there is six places for six discs. At first I thought that they had forgotten a disc, but then I doubled checked and yes the order was correct, five discs no more no less so don't let the extra slot worry you ! :D

4887609,5,B005SZ0WJG,"I absolutely ADORE this series and was sad when I got to the end of it! I was turned onto it by my daughter and her husband, as they had stumbled onto the series on netflix. I was able to borrow the second half of the series from the library (they were missing the first half, unfortunately). Then, one long weekend when my daughter & her family were out of town, I housesat and watched the first 12 episodes in 4 days. The problem I found with netflix was too-small yellow subtitles, and quite often a long sentence was crammed into a teeny super-thin impossible-to-read line (at least on a 20"" TV monitor), whereas on the DVDs the English subtitles are white, larger, and ALL were easy-to-read (longer sentences are on 2 lines, which makes sense). So I greatly recommend owning the DVDs and that's going on my Christmas wish list! Boys Over Flowers is based on a Japanese comic book series written by a woman in 1996! We haven't seen the Japanese TV series version, but we just LOVE LOVE LOVE the Korean. VERY exciting series! I give it the highest rating possible.

4887637,5,B005SZ0WJG,"I can't tell you how much I love this drama and how sorry I am to have wasted time not watching it before! I have been hearing about it for a couple of years and seen the manga and the anime show at the library and advertised on sites but I was only slightly interested. I am trying to learn Japanese, so I didn't want to be distracted with Korean dialog and having issues between picking up Korean and learning Japanese. The only reason I decided to watch it, was because Crunchy Roll had a free trial membership for 2 weeks to watch anime and dramas for free. I was hoping to see Japanese dramas but this popped up, so I figured, stop running and watched it. OMGosh, it was wonderful, maddening, frustrating, emotional, and awesome all wrapped up in one! You have got to see this show! I know a reviewer was talking about music issues, didn't bother me one bit. For me, it did not take away from the story at all. The part where they come into school as F4, music was different but I actually preferred the rock intro--made more sense and fit the scene much better; especially considering what Gu Jun-pyo did the first 40 seconds after appearing! Please don't let that distract you from buying this drama! It is well worth it! although, I have to admit I never spent $43 on a set before!

My box was broken when it came but that was because of how it was packaged, which was not the greatest and because UPS doesn't care about your stuff, they just throw it around, which looked exactly like what they did to it. It was just a piece of the enclosure but the box still closes and the cover corner was a little crunched but it was still in good shape, what could I do. Was not gonna send it back. The DVDs were intact, the packaging was little disappointing because I expected them to be on plastic trays in the box and they were in cottonish-plastic sleeves, but that is a manufacturing/production issue and not that big of a deal. Besides, I could always buy a DVD box I like, if I was that bothered. I am happy and satisfied that I now have my own copy, without the annoying commercials that interrupt every 7 minutes, that the websites force on you to just watch the dang show! Although, there is an annoying advertisement at the beginning of each episode that drove me crazy sometimes but I learned to ignore it and use it as an opportunity to go to the bathroom, check on a meal, pop some popcorn. It seems like it lasts forever but only about 20-30 seconds and only at the beginnings.

Like others have said, there are some typos, misspelled words and once or twice, the dialog didn't really convey the meaning clearly but it really is not that much of an issue; it wasn't like the whole movie and you still got the idea of what was being said, even if they worded it in the wrong or a confusing way. It wasn't hard to fill in the blanks of any confusing dialog that occurred. This version is from PMP and not bad in quality; the subtitles are clear enough to read and just the right size. The picture quality was good, could have been better but still worth the buy. The only way it could have been better was if it was on Blue-ray. So if you were hesitant to buy it, don't worry about it! This version is just fine! Buy it! I would also recommend after this, buying Naughty Kiss, which has Kim Hyun Joong, from this show as well. His two performances in these are as different as night and day! I totally forgot about him being in F4 after watching Naughty Kiss!

4887638,4,B005SZ0WJG,"Very good drama, tells the story of Geum Jan Di, a girl by saving a dying Shinwa school student, who was going to commit suicide, after no longer bear the abuse of students, organized and directed by the group elite school called the F4; this is admitted with a scholarship, to start studying at this institution, the adventure began for Jan Di. An argument very well done, with the recreation of a typical high school society with fun and humorous scenes, the Ku Hye Seon performance (Jan Di) characterizes very well the gestures and attitudes of a student from school.
otherwise the product is very good with a very slick and clear resolution, quality is optimal, but how have the dvd in the package, is not practical, can be damaged during shipping to the customer, although the box that contains them is tough, no others would be to think of a better way to package the dvd case inside the pack.

My comment on the mother ""witch"" character: Plausible until the ending.
How does a woman who finances a kidnapping that almost killed her son, destruction of families, humiliating anyone she perceives as obstacles for her egotistical desires, doesn't know her son, and is
such a good actress, you love to hate her, then ends up sweetly smiling with her husband

4887652,3,B005SZ0WJG,"First, the quality of the dvd is excellent. English subtitles are very good.

The reason this gets a 3 and not a 5 star rating is because by the 10th or 11th episode I was so sick of the performance of Koo Hye-sun I would roll my eyes every time she was on screen. Stuffing her mouth with food and then talking around the food (happened A LOT) I guess it is supposed to make her endearing and working class, but it was ridiculous after awhile. The way she would yell at the Lee Min-ho character and her parents, the pouting, shuffling her feet when she was trying to be ""cutesy"", the stupid way she would pretend to be surprised and overwhelmed by rich surroundings was just annoying, annoying, annoying. I couldn't understand how three of the shows most ""eligible"" men fell for her. She wasn't even charming. I don't know if that is Koo Hye-sun's fault or the director's, but it brought down my overall enjoyment of the show.

As for the rest, most of the cast were good (Jan-di's family were pretty annoying but who can say anything bad about Lee Min-ho except for the hair!), the storyline is good and particularly liked the story line with So Yi-Jung and Chu Ga-eul.

Overall recommendation -- buy it, it is worth it.",1404086400,4,1221,4.466367713004484

I admire JanDi  surviving by herself and then realizing that she wanted to be with her family.  Also, the different classes (rich vs. poor) showed that people are different yet also the same in life.  This is a feel good movie when things are solved.

I was apprehensive at first because i thought this dvd set was not going to be as good as the Netflix version but I have never been happier. Especially since the price was not as ludicrous as the other version I've seen. The series comes in brand new packaging with 5 dvds containing all 25 episodes.  The subtitles are a bit different from the Netflix version and the some of the scenes don't play the kpop music I am used to hearing but sweet classical music instead. However, the integrity and humor of the show is very much intact. In fact, I find that these subtitles flow a bit better than the Netflix version. As a fan girl of the series, I am thrilled with this purchase!

Pros: good price, good subtitles and fast shipping
cons: none

Update review:
Differences I noticed compared with YA entertainment version ( Netflix version) and PMP version ( this product) after borrowing the YA version from my local library. Overall, in terms of series satisfaction I feel there is no difference. However, I think its important for people to know what are some the subtle differences between the 2. For one, the YA version has special features (such as mini behind the scenes footage and a segment the cast did on a talk show). Secondly, which is the most obvious is the soundtrack music used in the PMP version vs. YA (Netflix version). The Netflix version (YA) uses about 4-5 songs interchangeably while the PMP version (this product) uses those songs plus other songs in the series (Lee MinHo's song ""My Everything"" plays during the final scene for example).

I still think this product deserves a 5 star rating because for the price I paid for, I still got what I wanted: My favorite k-drama with good subtitles ( slightly different subtitles compared to Netflix but good nonetheless) without paying an exuberant amount of money.

Last Note: Package differences between YA and PMP.
YA comes in a plastic case with plastic holders inside to hold the dvds
PMP (this product) comes in a plastic case with sleeve holders inside the dvds.",1394582400,51,2174,4.6484375

4887686,3,B005SZ0WJG,"This is the third Korean drama that I watched on Netflix with English subtitles. There are 25 episodes, and each episode is just over an hour long.

Lee Min Ho stars as the arrogant, wealthy King bee at an exclusive high school.  He and his 3 friends (the ""F4"") rule the school with cruel ruthlessness.  The heroine is a poor commoner who is given a scholarship to the high school for an act of bravery. She is subjected to relentless bullying instigated by the F4 boys. Over time, they realize that she has a heart of gold and they become her staunchest supporters.

The hero gets 5 stars for his acting in this 25-episode series. He is perfect as the teenage high school king bee, sneering and snobby and filthy rich. He was very charming and endearing as he learned the pleasures of commoner food such as ramen.

The heroine's acting in the first 7 episodes was hard to watch. She has a very narrow face which was usually scrunched up in pouts, sneers, and snivelling expressions that caused her chin and cheeks to have dimples and lines. Combined with the bags under her eyes, her slapstick overacting, her bowl cut hair with straight cut bangs, and deliberate stomping, clumpy gait, she overdid the petulent, childish, ugly duckling part and looked like a 35 year old in a bad wig with bad acting, rather than a spunky but sweet 16 or 17 year old.

The initial episodes are about her difficulties fitting in at the new rich school.  As the plot progresses, the characters slowly mature.  As the heroine endures hardship after hardship, her character learns wisdom, stops pouting and snivelling, and as she becomes more reflective, serene, and wise, her acting improves immeasurably.

The plot is like a teenage fantasy, a cross between Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling. Poor girl, neither smart or pretty, goes to rich school full of pretty rich people, ends up with the friendship of the four most swoon-worthy guys, and falls in love.

Unfortunately, there are many, many, problems with the plot. It jumps from location to location without much explanation. The heroine keeps on starting new jobs, but there is no explanation about what happens to those jobs later on. Does she keep all 5-7 (I lost count) jobs until the end? There are many plots and it's hard to know which character knows what's really going on.  Does the hero know half of what his mother is doing to the heroine? Most of the misunderstandings could have been avoided if the main couple just talked to each other like normal people or friends.  Instead, it takes a very long time for the heroine to finally tell the hero what she decides to do after high school, or for the hero to tell her the problem with his mother. Even the last hour of the series was hard to believe. In the real world, you need ongoing communication to have a decent relationship.

The first half of the series, every 1-2 episodes the heroine would fall unconscious (from beating, drowning, being drugged, exhaustion, etc.) or would need otherwise need rescuing from the F4.  Really? How much of a damsel in distress can she be? The only time she stands up for herself is if she is protecting someone else. Otherwise, she just stands there and waits to be hurt.  It helps that one of the F4 has an internal emergency bell that alerts him to go to her whenever she needs rescuing.  No, really, he says that in the story.

The first half of the series, the hero is the absolute ruler of his little world.  The latter half he becomes a helpless victim, which was hard to believe.  Also hard to believe is that just having graduated from high school, with no further education, at the age of 19 or 20, he is appointed managing director of the most powerful Korean conglomerate? Really?

Initially, the heroine's family was very vulgar, low class, and social climbing in intent.  They were also badly overacting.  It's only as the story unfolds that I could appreciate their love, bonding and generosity with each other. As they endure poverty, starvation and hardship, they became a prime example of what a family should be.

I toughed it out and watched all 25 episodes.  It was worth it to watch Lee Min Ho, but the storyline and plot were hard to swallow. I liked that the heroine learned wisdom, acted kindly under fire, and brought a lot of happiness to other people.  The storyline is pretty unrealistic though.

For a better series, I'd recommend Secret Garden. Even though it has a body swap premise, it is more realistic and better acted than Boys Over Flowers.",1392854400,4,4517,4.64321608040201

I don't want to reveal anything in the series, but near the end when one of the characters says, ""We've been through so much together.""  I start yelling at the tv listing all of the things that the lead female character has been through,  LOL!  It's awesome because I love shows that get you so involved with the characters and storyline that you yell and shake your fist at the tv.  It's awesome!

It didn't end exactly the way that I wanted it to, but then I'm not the writer and I can live with the ending as it was written.  I'm just not personally satisfied with it.  Watch it and you might agree with me on that point.

The subtitles are not the official subtitles and we are not sure but it appears the DVD's are copies, not originals.
The DVD set was costly and I spent a lot of money to then ship it overseas.
I am not at all satisfied with the order.  Is there anything that can be done about this.  It is to costly for her to return the order back to the states at this point, but the DVD set is not usable at all.

This series I came across on Netflix and watched it and to my surprise I could not stop watching. I needed this so bad to at the time,my Mother has just passed away and this series brought so much needed laughter,tears and ultimately joy. This may seem corny at times but you just can not help falling in love with the story. I eventually bought the soundtrack from here and keep it on my Ipod. This is a must for anyone who needs a boost with their lives because it is a life affirming show. The series does leave you hanging on the end and there is a follow up movie available on here,but it is not the same actors and it really doesn't fit with the series.

4887758,4,B005SZ0WJG,"After watching ""Boys Over Flowers"" on Hulu, I decided I had to have a copy of the show for my DVD library.  The story is great, the characters are intriguing, and the show is just very entertaining as a whole.

What I didn't like about this product was that the music is different in a lot of very important places.  Most notably, the ""Almost Paradise"" theme that plays during a lot of F4 scenes was almost always replaced.  Even the instrumental rendition of the song that plays when the boys first walk through the school doors is replaced by some heavy metal music that I might've found fitting had I not grown so attached to the show's main theme song.

Also, there were a few typos in the English translations as well as translations that didn't make quite as much sense as the ones on Hulu do.  Since I don't speak Korean fluently, this was another bummer to add to the list.  If you're thinking about buying this version of the show, I suggest just watching it on Hulu and suffering through the commercials.  Music really can make or break a show, and the music for the originally aired episodes proves that.",1368748800,30,1115,4.485148514851486
4887759,4,B005SZ0WJG,I absolutely adore this show!!! No lying the best I have ever watched. I have yet to find one that compares. The only prob was the subtitles. I originally watched the show on Netflix and their subtitles are way better and more detailed. I feel like these are a Lil more dumbed down,1368403200,,281,4.320754716981132

It's about a quorky girl who get's into a rich school and Joon Pyo(lee minho) starts to make her life hell, but she pushes through it!

4887764,2,B005SZ0WJG,"**SPOILER ALERT*** I actually bought this from iOffer but they won't let me edit my comment so I decided to write a review here. The dvd case looks like this exact one except on the cover it says in English ""Boys Before Flowers"" and the Korean title under it. It is made by KBS and there are 3 dvds that are DVD-9. It is a strong cardboard material instead of the normal plastic that we have in the U.S. It is much more sturdy than the plastic version.

Here comes the bad news. It looks like KBS just recorded it off the air. The picture isn't great and sometimes they had a red banner at the bottom of the screen with korean words moving across. Don't know why that was there. I can see the pixels and sometimes the color is really bad. It got to a point where they looked orange in one of the scenes. This wasn't a breaking point for me though. The subtitles and the missing scenes killed it for me. For example, when Jun Pyo gives Jan Di the swimming goggles from the auction. It jumped from seeing Jun Pyo in his suit that he is auctioning...to Jan Di's family trying to sell her goggles at her house. I was totally annoyed.

Now for the subtitles. Netflix and Hulu have amazing english subtitles compared to this version. They explain the meaning of words such as Jan Di meaning grass and them calling her a weed. They do not do that with these subtitles. Also whoever made these subtitles does not know how to speak english properly. Whenever they should say ""lets"" they say ""let"". For example, ""Let(s) get her."" Not a breaking point but their conversions of words and lingo definitely were. It just doesn't flow as well...Hope this helped. I know I would have appreciated this information before I bought this product. Hopefully more people can post the quality of the different versions of Boys over Flowers and City Hunter so we can figure out which is the best one to buy.

The quality of everything makes up for it i've already watched majority of my discs and have found no issues with them, no skipping, scratches, sound off or anything of that sort. It shipped fast too so i went right into watching it when it arrived.

If you're interested in owning Boys Over Flowers it's a pretty awesome drama. It's got a bit of everything and always has you on the edge of your seat going ""WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW???"" it's crazy and it's a pretty good tear jerker too.

However, the third disc has a flaw that keeps the disc from being played properly.  The seller has diligently tried to get a different disc, but all three disc I've tried had the same flaw and stop playing in the same spot.  It's a very small, hard to detect dimple on the play side of the disc.  The rest of the discs are great and I really appreciate being able to have the English subtitles for the songs as well as the speaking.  However, I think there are times when the Netflix version has a better translation and gives more of the conversation in English than this version.

We both watched Boys Over Flowers together for the 1st time this past summer and loved it! It can get a little too emotional (lots of crying) for my taste, but I still think it's a great show! My friend didn't seem to mind the crying though, so keep in mind that it's just me who doesn't care for the lead crying over the male lead and the male lead crying over the lead and boo-hoo-hoo...I just can't.
I did find this show to be very funny though and the actors are amazing! *cough* Kim Hyunjoong *cough*

I am happy with everything so far! It came sooner then I expected, very fast and everything is intact. So yeah, nothing really to complain about yet!

It made all the difference to the whole mood of each scene.  The music is the original score and that's what I was looking for.  The only thing that is a little irritating is the commercial that plays in the beginning but other than that I loved this complete set.
update:  I just finished watching all 25 episodes and I found several different songs in the later episodes.  There is one song sung I think by Lee Min Ho in the pivotal scene in episode 25 and at the end of that episode.
