He was quite creepy near the end. I would definitely recommend if you like horror comedy movies. Lots of funny scenes in this one and fun to watch. For a low budget flick, I think they did good. I know people online hated this one, but I enjoyed it. You will need a region free bluray player to see this though or a region B bluray player.",1446854400,,514,4.099009900990099
8563553,4,B00B79OY3W,"The film starts out with zombies in the first clip. You don't know why they are there, unless you read the DVD by-line. It starts with three main characters, Boris (Michael Gamarano)a cowardly policeman who is still handing out parking tickets during the Apocalypse. There is also a milkman (David McClelland) and a man (George McCluskey) who learned survival skills in the service...the postal service. If you don't read the by-line you will know what caused the zombie outbreak 80 minutes into the film, although it does have a flashback subplot. Our core group is joined by others as most of the film, like most zombie films, is consumed by their traveling and killing zombies. The end was unexpected. The humor was hit and miss, with a few good scenes.

Worth watching for those who like a little humor with their zombies.
