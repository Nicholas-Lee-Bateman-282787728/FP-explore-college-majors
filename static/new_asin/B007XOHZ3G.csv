8522987,2,B007XOHZ3G,"I am looking for a new Sex Ed video to use in my 5th grade class, and I had high hopes when I saw this was a Disney production. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed and won't be using it. The animations were better than in ""The Birds, the Bees, and Me for Girls,"" but still not likely to appeal to students. At only 14 minutes, it also doesn't go into sufficient detail. The fact that it appears to be out-of-production probably says it all...

If you're looking for a good Sex Ed video, I recommend ""What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up."" Even though it's over 20 years old, it's still the best video I've found on the subject.",1361664000,6,641,4.254098360655738
