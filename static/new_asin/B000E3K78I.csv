8105076,4,B000E3K78I,"Excellent Insight into the Style and Songs that make SRV a Legend, Great Playing That will Inspire you to add These Techniques to your own Style. I would Have Rated it a 5 Star if they had utilized a Backing Track or Bass and Drums When Licks were Played Back.",1270684800,,260,4.22
8105077,5,B000E3K78I,"I disagree with the other reviewer on this dvd. Jammie Humphries is a skilled and excellent teacher of this type of guitar genre. I also own Vol 2 SRV in this series that features ""couldnt stand the weather"" and ""Lenny"" and thought it was extremely acurate and well laid out. Jammie walks you through both rythym  and leads parts on these dvd's and makes it fun and interesting to learn SRV guitar licks.

The other thing that he does that others miss is show you all the usable blues scales that are used and this gives you a boatload more technique for the dollar, after playing and learnning from this dvd i found myself being alot more confident in my blues solo's. Tablature can take you only so far. What Humphries teaches you is to have some soul and understanding of how string bends and trill's can effect the mood of a blues song and thats more important than being a TAB ROBOT that so many player are these days ""technical understanding but no soul to their playing"".

He has a way of teaching that pulls you into the style and structure of the music and that is a lost art these days among DVD instructinal teachers. It was good enough for me to buy his entire collection of DVD's HE IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST.

8105078,2,B000E3K78I,I bought this DVD hoping it would show the entire songs.  It does not.  Pretty much hits the parts here and there.  I have been looking for a DVD that shows you every thing played and found it after buying this.  It was found at [...]  Amazing accuracy and the entire song is taught which is pretty amazing.,1201737600,3,307,4.224137931034483
