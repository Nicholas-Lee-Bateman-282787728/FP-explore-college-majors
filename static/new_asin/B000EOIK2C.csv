8111938,3,B000EOIK2C,"I  enjoyed the style of animation. It really did work, especially with the battle scenes.  I'm not sure the voice talents used here were used elsewhere in the verse, but for the most part, they weren't bad. The story line worked well... but then again, it was written by Larry Hama.",1426204800,,282,4.509803921568627

8111945,4,B000EOIK2C,"As a recent GI Joe fan, I still have a lot to learn and I've seen a lot of fans complain about the new stuff.

The storyline and character development could have used some work. I'd watched the second movie, Valor vs. Venom, before watching this and some of the changes in the characters seemed sketchy to me (For example, Beachhead's voice had almost a surfer dude tone to it that didn't seem to fit the tough-as-nails drill sargent I'd read about on websites). Some of the voices and graphics involving the faces seemed exagerrated, but a commentary claims this is more a quirk of production than anything else.

But, you look for perfection in anything and you're dissapointed. Just sit back and enjoy and you'll have a lot more fun. I found it easy to ignore the quirks because it still had plenty to offer. A story that still got the job done, a lot of fun characters, more than enough action, plus some funny scenes to keep things interesting. This is a college student talking, so this is just a grown-up looking more closely at it. I've already seen one review that shows what the movie's about: Something for kids, and their parents, to have fun with and enjoy.

The features are a lot of fun to play with, including a cool music video, character profiles, a behind-the-scenes peek at how the movie was made, and some commercials that actually proved to be more interesting than I thought. The commercials actually include a lot more footage that, while not really from the movie itself, are still cool to watch and feature some characters and envirnoments that didn't quite make it into the movie.

I still recommend this movie if you're willing to make the extra effort to find it. The key is to just sit back and enjoy the ride. If you're looking for the cast to be exact carbon copies of their original characters, you'll be dissappointed. If you're just a Joe fan and want to see your favorite fighting force in beautiful, computer animation, you'll be a happy fan.",1200441600,2,1979,4.597733711048159
