Since I had little choice in that matter when I was looking for a new VHS anime with my girlfriend (she only has a tape player) at Suncoast Videos, I looked at the big words on the back cover and was completely drawn in by the, ""Mom went on vacation, and all I got was this lousy girl.""  The description on the back sounded just as interesting and quirky as that phrase, so after just a little convincing by my girlfriend, we picked it up.  I'm so glad we did.  The animation is enticing, it is outrageously funny,  and it will be an anime you will want to watch again and again!  I just hope more episodes will be turned into anime!",1066867200,2,763,4.300699300699301
8408467,5,B00003IXE0,"Tattoon master is a great anime!  It contains comedy, magic, love, and some fight scenes.  The pace of the story is pretty fast, which is becoming  the norm of modern day TV shows and movies. This anime is a must have!",967075200,,218,4.2682926829268295
8408468,4,B00003IXE0,"Well, what can I say??  It was funny and had a lot of crazy characters in  it.  It had a determined priestess who was bound on love, a crazy  arrow-shooting chick who seemed to detest men, a hormonal pervert father,  two guys (have no real comment on them except they were kinda funny), and a  very hot-tempered Eric (who happens to be my favorite person in the  anime)who short fuses over any little thing, but somewhere deep inside he  has a kind heart.  The actions kinda cool, but the way these girls fall for  Eric is kinda sickening!  They hardly even know the guy!  Oh well, I guess  I'm not the type to believe in love at first sight.  But, if you're looking  for some laughs, buy this tape!  That is all!  Bye now!  ~Q.",965001600,2,728,4.266666666666667
8408469,5,B00003IXE0,"Tatoon Master, follows the exploits of a young female tribal warrior (Nima) who goes to Japan to find a boy (Hibio) she saw in a picture.  Once she comes in contact with him, she finds that he doesn't like girls, in  fact he wants nothing to do with them, but instead of leaving she decides  to hang around for awhile... Just long enough for trouble to start brewing  when another love-struck female gets thrown into the picture.  Its an all  out jelousy battle and arrows, that arn't exactly of the cupid make, begin  to fly.  I highly recommend this 2-episode OVA and would love to see a  sequel.",961113600,3,598,4.462962962962963
8408470,5,B00003IXE0,i think this  anime was very well done it was interesting as well as had that affect that would knock your boots off from laughter.the best part were the characters becuase they have so many different quirks about them  that just made them amazingly interesting and funny.,961027200,,272,4.76595744680851
