It does, as an extra, contain the very short film that was made for the festival.  This is an important event in Rock history as it marks the official end of the Acid Tests, which had begun in 1964.",1526169600,,297,4.192982456140351

The participants in creating this event were some of the major heavyweights in the San Francisco music scene. It is a fascinating film to watch and is well worth the money. If you love the psychedelic era this movie is a must see.,1320796800,23,318,4.5
