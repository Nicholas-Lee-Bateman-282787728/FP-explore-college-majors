7930500,5,B0000541XE,"VCI Entertainment and Puritan Pictures present ""Gun Code""(1940) (Dolby

digitally remastered)...relive those thrilling days from the early '30s and '40s

when drama took us down the dusty trails and the plains to exciting

adventures....some of the best B-Westerns ever to grace the Saturday Matinee

Screen......the Native Americans had no better ambassador than Tim McCoy, a

former Indian language translator in real life...as Tim McCoy speaks

passionately about this country's longtime abuse of its native population by

breaking treaty after treaty...just remember double thrills, chills, mystery and

suspense...hitting the bull's eye with excitement...don't miss any of the Tim

McCoy features loaded with action that will leave you wanting more of his

B-Western adventures

Under director Sam Newfield, producer Sigmund Neufeld, original screenplay Joseph O'Donnell...the cast include Tim McCoy (Marshal Tim Hammond/Tim Hays), Inna Gest (Betty Garrett), Lou Fulton ('Curley' Haines), Alden 'Stephen' Chase (James M Bradley/Banker), Carleton Young (Slim Doyle/henchman), Ted Adams (Sheriff Kramer), Robert Winkler (Jerry Garrett), Dave O'Brien (Gale/henchman), George Chesbro (Bart/henchman), Jack Richardson (Mike McClure), John Elliott (Parson A. Hammond). . . . . . . . our hero Tim McCoy this time is battling a gange of extortionists led by Alden Chase, Carleton Young, Dave O'Brien and one of my favorite badmen George Chesbro...usually cast as a villain Ted Adams is the Sheriff and between McCoy and him they set up a fake jailbreak with McCoy pretending to kill Adams...another great B-Western for Tim McCoy under the Puritan Pictures banner for Poverty Row, proves to be one of his finest performances.

Special footnote, actor Tim McCoy in real life was a sharpshooter and famed for

his fast draw...was an expert on the Old West also an authority on Indian

folklore could converse in Indian sign language...McCoy was inducted into the

""Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage

Museum"" in 1973, also inducted into ""The Cowboy Hall of Fame"" in 1974.
