152667,2,0792845552,Oh dear the ravages of time have rendered this worm very weak. I saw it as Witchfinder General in the UK years ago and the audience cheered when the revenge hit the floor.  But now it looks very much a Hammer Horror B movie.  Endles shots of horses galloping. Very nice if your an equestrian but it does not further the plot.  Lovely scenery and Cromwellian housing does not make a good film.  Based on fact they say. Well this is one film that should go the way of the witches. It has appalling acting with women making feeble tears and cries. And some of the wigs are gloriously illfitting and clearly made of straw. Perhaps they are Cromwellian.

It's based on a true story, and from what I saw in the film, I'm glad those days are over.  The rest of the cast do a fine job, especially the lovely Hilary Dwyer, who portrays Sara.

152670,5,0792845552,"One of the most disturbing and brutal films of all time. Vincent Price tones down his flamboyant acting style to give one of his most harrowing performances as brutal witchunter Matthew Hopkins who roamed the English countryside during the Cromwelian era in search of suspected witches. When he hangs the the priest uncle of roundhead Ian Ogilvy's lover the vengeful soldier sets out for revenge which culminates in an unforgettable and highly disturbing climax. The horror of the film is not about witches but about what a human being is capable of. Young upcoming director Michael Reeves' suicide after the films release only adds to the films notoriety and plea for a saner world. Released in Britain as ""Matthew Hopkins Witchfinder General"" which is a much better title and distances itself from the AIP release as an Edgar Allan Poe tale.",973209600,6,843,4.98581560283688
152671,4,0792845552,"The Conqueror Worm is a textbook example of a movie's potential prospects  as an acknowledged classic being wrecked by the stupidity of critics and  the cynical manipulations of a distributor underestimating the intelligence  of American viewers. Distributed by AIP in America as ""The Conqueror  Worm"" and purportedly ""based on the writing of Edgar Allan  Poe"", the film got buried by disinterested US critics who incorrectly  passed it off as simply another addition to the increasingly tiresome Poe  fare being churned out by AIP, Roger Corman and others. The casting of  Vincent Price, of course, only strengthened this unfortunate and lazy  critical impulse. For this, the distributor is as much to blame as the  critics, by consciously pursuing a marketing strategy which implied  precisely what critics chose to believe. And by tampering with the film  itself to contrive to provide a Poe connection (by adding prologue and  epilogue commentary by Vincent Price quoting from Poe's poem) AIP hung its  sinking critical reputation around the neck of this great movie. In fact,  The Conqueror Worm has nothing to do with Edgar Allan Poe and was not even  made by the AIP studio either. And when US critics began hearing European  buzz about a great little horror movie called The Witchfinder General by an  innovative young Brit director, Michael Reeves, how were they then to know  it was the same movie they had so flippantly disregarded? By the time The  Witchfinder General was rereviewed as the stand alone original it is, it  was too late. The movie's moment had passed amongst the moviegoing  mainstream. It is only through its devoted cult following that memory of it  and its tragic young director (who died in mysterious circumstances at the  age of 25) has deservedly been kept alive. Considered in the context of its  time, The Conqueror Worm is a powerful, violent tale of hypocrisy and  vengeance. It tells the story of the villainous opportunist Matthew Hopkins  and his  sidekick, the brutish moron John Stearne, who went from village to  village in Cromwellian England torturing, hanging and burning  ""witches"". The movie pulls no punches in its portrayal of the  methods used by Hopkins and Stearne to extract confessions and exact  punishment, but is also satisfyingly contemptuous in its portrayal of these  two psychopaths. In this regard, Reeves manages something even Roger Corman  couldn't do: extract a layered, complex and credible performance from the  normally corny Vincent Price. This simply has to be one of his best  performances ever - the one that could've given him consolidated mainstream  respectability, but the one that probably the least people actually saw.  Ian Ogilvy (TV's The Saint - after Roger Moore's stint)- is also very good  as the tender then vengeful soldier, Richard Marshall. I am of the view  that the original reason this film got trumpeted as a horror movie related  to the casting of Vincent Price and AIP's cynical business calculations.  However, it is indeed a horror movie, just not the kind of horror movie AIP  wanted the public to believe. It falls rather - despite its gorgeous  costume dress and sets - into the same category of horror sub genre which  deals with studies of pure evil a la Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.  (In fact, the knowing, murderous collusion - and tension - between Hopkins  and Stearne resembles somewhat the relationship between the calculating  Henry and moronic Otis in the later movie.) The Conqueror Worm is also,  however, a revenge movie - a kind of proto-Death Wish - in that the story  is driven by Richard Marshall's obsessive quest to avenge the violation and  rape of his fiance by both Hopkins and Stearne. The movie looks fantastic,  probably the best sense of that period ever captured on film. The shots of  Marshall racing his horse through the English countryside under a  foreboding evening sky are simply breathtaking. The images are strong and  dark as well, contributing to a grave atmosphere of oppression in the air.  The opening scenes - incorporating a lone townsman preparing a hilltop  gallows against a dark sky and an old woman being dragged to her execution  - are as powerful as anything you'll ever see. The wonderful thing is, the  movie never lets up on this opening power. It runs its violent course  without dragging and delivers a stunning visual feast of violence and evil.  This movie absolutely has to find its way to DVD - and soon. And, for once,  the audience frustration that builds up in the face of hypocrisy and  cruelty, is satifactorily resolved. So, for those of you who are still  wound up from having experienced Nicholas Hytner's brilliant version of  Arthur Miller's The Crucible, watch this movie to get the closure you need!  Highly recommended to serious moviegoers and collectors - but also as a  great midnight with popcorn movie for couples! At under $12, buy, buy, buy.  Or wait for the DVD which will be stunning.",968284800,49,4976,4.972019464720194
152672,4,0792845552,"Just like the Haunted Palace, City beneath the sea (War gods of the deep)  and the Oblong box this Vincent Price film claims influence from Poe, but  the only influence is the title. This film was released as the Witchfinder  General in England, whih is a much netter name. In general, the late 1960's  saw a decrease in quality in horror films, but this is definitely an  exception. There was supposedly a great deal of hostility on the set of  this film and some sources say director Michael Reeves tried to create  anger to inspire the actors to show anger in their performances. Originally  Reeves wanted Donald Pleasance in the main role, but the studio got Price  and he excels in a very harsh and serious portrayl. This film is very  violent for the time and sometimes a little disturbing, perhaps a little  too real at times which is both good and bad at the same time. The settings  and costumes are very good, the film was made in October and November so  you really get a chilly autumn setting that adds to the film. The ending  could have been better, but this is still a very different and enjoyable  horror film.",962755200,2,1126,4.5049504950495045
152673,2,0792845552,"My copy of the movie has a few scenes out of sequence. It disrupts the flow of the movie and is an obvious production error.
 The movie itself is an okay film about two real men -- Matthew Hopkins (played by Vincent  Price with proper Puritan severity) and Thomas Stearne, witchfinders during  England's Civil War. Their first victim in the film Vicar John Lowes was a  real life victim of their persecutions.
  In Britain, the movie is called  Witchfinder General and based off a book by Ronald Bassett of the same  title. But in the US, voiceover narration was added at the very beginning  and tail end of Vincent Price reading Poe's poem the Conqueror Worm. It was  retitled in the States to fool people into thinking it was an adaptation of  Poe's works.
 And the original theatrical trailer included on the video  tape proudly shouts ""Only from the pen of Edgar Allan Poe could come  from such a horrendous tale of terror!""
  Err.... not likely.

152724,3,0792845552,"Remembered now for the fact that it was helmed by Michael Reeves - who was only 24 at the time, and would later kill himself of a drug overdose, thereby curtailing a promising career - THE WITCHFINDER GENERAL is a low-budget Gothic movie notable for a scene-chewing performance by Vincent Price in the title role.  Shot in the flat wastelands of Bury St. Edmunds in the east of England, the film is notable for its use of atmospherics - the stark branches of the trees shot against a uniformly gray sky, the wan sunsets of a winter's day signaling the onset of night.  Cinematically speaking, Reeves makes considerable use of the zoom for dramatic effect; together with Paul Ferris' otherworldly music, it helps to create a world in which concepts of 'right' and 'wrong,' 'piety' and 'blasphemy' have been overturned.  Everyone must try to fend for themselves, and only the fittest - in this case Matthew Hopkins (Price) survive.

The film's historical setting - during the darkest days of the English Civil War - is merely a pretext for Reeves to conduct a searching analysis of the latent violence lurking beneath any so-called 'civilized' society.  Taking advantage of the relaxed censorship environment prevailing in the late Sixties, he includes some gruesome moments - as, for example, at the beginning, when a limb of a hanging victim is shown being roasted over an open fire.  This is a LORD OF THE FLIES-type world in which human beings have been reduced to savages under the cloak of religious zeal; despite his apparently civilized exterior, the Witchfinder-General is perhaps the most extreme example of this.  Although vanquished in the end - and Price handles his demise with all the &eacute;lan characteristic of his earlier horror film roles, notably in the Corman/Poe cycle during the early Sixties - his legacy lives on; the world is not restored to 'normality.'

Although produced during an era of significant social change, THE WITCHFINDER GENERAL is actually a misogynist piece.  Women are either represented as virgins or whores, to be protected - or more commonly abused - by men.  The opening sequence sets the tone, as an innocent victim (Ann Tirard) is pulled along the ground, screaming all the while, and brutally hanged  Thereafter women are shown in sexually provocative positions, or else framed in close-up trying to assume a position of sexual attraction in order to gull Matthew.  This is a strategy used by Sara (Hilary Dwyer) later on.

THE WITCHFINDER GENERAL is an entertaining piece - anything with Price in the leading role is bound to have its attractive features - but it is very much of its time, a product of the so-called 'Swinging Sixties.'",1415404800,,2686,4.942222222222222

But how successful will their operations be when the fianc of one of the accused hears about their ethically dubious ways and sets forth with his army to stop them?

152730,5,0792845552,"A horror film without the supernatural is like saying, a disaster film without a disaster.  But that's what Witchfinder General is and yet it is scarier and more disturbing than all of the gothic, castle in lightening and thunderous nights and creepy, eyes in the portrait following you everywhere horror films that flooded B-Movie houses during those years.  Witchfinder General is a 17th Century depiction of what real human manifested horror is in the way Bogdonovich's, Targets is a 20th Century true horror film.  It's about what real people do to others that's ""not good"" and anyway you slice that that is far more terrifying than any supernatural threat that may or may not have ever occurred.

Price plays Matthew Hopkins a self appointed and financially motivated Witch finder who wanders the English countryside showing up with his sadistic sidekick in any village or hamlet where some person has been accused by the locals of consorting with the devil.
Although Hopkins alludes to objectivity concerning his Witch determining skills, it becomes quickly apparent that once anyone is accused, the guidelines of his ""testing"" leaves no way out for them.  It's impossible to stay alive and be determined innocent.  The very act of dying in one of the cases ( an elderly woman lowered into water by a rope tied 'round her waist) was the only path to acquittal for that poor soul.

Set against these two true minions of earthly hell is a young beautiful couple hoping to marry.  She, having an uncle with the great misfortune of being a Catholic priest in a festering anti-papal nation and he, a young Coronet (Lieutenant) in Oliver Cromwell's rebel army, played by Ian Ogilvy, who is perhaps the real lead of this film.  The story gets cooking as Hopkins descends on the innocent priest.  His niece who is his charge attempts saving him through the loss of her own innocence.  I won't reveal anymore plot points other than to state that with Hopkins, you can't win.  Or can you?  And at what price?

So I've mentioned Price, I've mentioned Ogilvy - both great but the truel star of this film is it's twenty something director and co-writer, Michael Reeves.  A young man who made two terrific films; this being his best before succumbing to a bout of drinking and downers that would end his life shortly after Witchfinder's release.  He was truly the star of this film.  Without him it could have been a B-horror movie ala Corman, but his wisdom-beyond-youth abilities elevates this film to just below the heights of The Exorcist and The Shining.  Certainly on par with Robert Wise's The Haunting.  His three great virtues as the director start with initially crafting a narrative screenplay out of what is essentially a basic history book written about Hopkins.  Then, in really having a feel for the very English countryside where the actual Hopkins roamed and hence shooting it with a lyrical and melancholy flow.  And lastly, his taming of an already legendary horror film actor, the great Vincent Price.  And it is about this interaction that makes the film stand out beyond the great film it is, for the twenty something director was not going to put up with an entertaining but straight off the shelf performance by Price.  This young man Reeves was one of those rare artists who's confidence in his own ability and his craftiness at application so managed to wrangle the star in, that, although acrimony developed, Price would later state that is was one of his best films.  Another remarkable aspect of the film is it's look and professionalism on a minuscule budget; some 80 thousand English pounds in the day.

Honorable mention goes to Robert Russell who plays John Stearn, Hopkins torturing sidekick and occasional adversary.

And there were other horrors associated with this film.  For one it's American distributer re-titleing it, The Conquerer Worm and replacing it's stellar orchestrated score with bad synth music and the fact that it's dashing young lead, Ian Ogilvy, never went on to much bigger fame.  He has had some success but not what he deserved.

This is really a horror film most likely because it's not about horror at all.  It's about bad people doing bad things and that can be pretty horrible.  Please see it.  Honor this director's best work and spread the word.

Oh and just one other thing:  watch the movie and tell me that Kubrick didn't borrow from it!  Watch it.  The scene for those who know The Shining will be unmistakable.  That alone should put Reeves in the top echelon of filmmakers.",1393459200,7,4535,4.8428571428571425

Having compared the Midnight Movies version to my Image laser disc version, I found that I prefer the Image disc hands down.  Here's why.  Some people think that by titling the film, THE CONQUEROR WORM, that somehow the film was abnormally cut in terms of nudity and violence.  Not exactly true.  I found that the music from the CW laser disc was the same as the Shout DVD.  The CW laserdisc has all the nudity and violence, except for one scene where the guy's guts are hanging out a bit longer.  The DVD has all the wenches dressed and NOT topless, like in the laserdisc version.  The DVD picture quality seems too stark, with all the atmospheric outdoor scenes missing that beautiful hue that the laserdisc captures.  Also, I'm not positive on this, but I think there was a scene where some women and children in rags are roasting potatoes in the ashes of the firepit where witches were burned.  It was in the laser disc version, but I don't recall the scene in the DVD version.  To make a long story short, people who were expecting to finally see this film in it's restored, uncut version, were cheated to the max by the Midnight Movies folks, and they should get their money back.  What they got was the UK print that was censored for years, not the international print, which has been available everywhere as Conqueror Worm.  The DVD is anamorphic, but that term seems somewhat of a joke when th print is matted, and missing the top and bottom of the picture, where the full screen laser disc has the entire image.

152759,1,0792845552,"Wow. This was nothing like I expected- having read many positive reviews in many places.

Vincent Price is wasted and appears uninvested in the project. Excessive screen time is thrown away on endless chases on horseback. The incredibly thin plot just goes round and round in circles. There is the barest shred of motivation for Price's character. And what there is is muddled and confused.

And WHY is a priest practically encouraging an unwed couple to fornicate under his roof? So the film can have a love-making scene? The often lovely, backlit by-the-sun location footage is marred by an incredibly generic ""sweeping romantic"" score. (albeit typical of the period)

Climactic scenes are robbed of impact by poorly-executed physical effects (especially the so-obvious-it's-painful use of a back-board during a violent assault.

I do feel the film has two things going for it- an incredibly a-typical downbeat & thought-provoking ending, and Wilfrid Brambell's cameo (which he obviously could've done in his sleep, but it benefits from being sandwiched between boring nonsense).

Anyway, I dove for my discs of THEATER OF BLOOD and THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES  to wipe this from my fond film memories of vincent Price.",1280102400,6,1219,5.225641025641026
152760,5,0792845552,"Matthew Hopkins (Vincent Price) is in the witchfinding business. He travels the countryside, fulfilling his calling as God's judge, looking for witches to eradicate. It's the 1640s, and business is good! Europe is awash in ignorance and superstition. It is the perfect time for the WITCHFINDER GENERAL to apply his techniques in order to seek out and destroy the many children of satan. What is a witch? Why, anyone who displays characteristics that Hopkins says are witch-like. Thankfully, Hopkins is a reasonable, fair-minded man. He'll use only sanctioned torture to extract confessions, followed by a quick hanging or burning at the stake. Of course, Hopkins will collect a lot of gold for his services. After all, witch-hunting is hard work! WITCHFINDER GENERAL is a tale of religious insanity, greed, and murder. Price is at his best, portraying Hopkins as a ruthless, relentless zealot w/ no regard for anything other than his mission (and its monetary rewards). He'll even sleep w/ several beautiful, young witches if he has to! It's all part of the job.

152761,5,0792845552,"This film is somewhat of a departure for Vincent Price. Here, here is not a supernatural ghoul or goblin, but depicts Matthew Hopkins, a real historical figure who tortured innocents in the name of the cross. This is probably his best performance.

The torture and violence is graphic, but doesnt linger so long on screen as to become distasteful, as in say: ""Ilsa, She-Wolf of the S.S."". While this film is definitely not for children, it could probably be safely viewed by an intelligent 11-13 kid without totally warping their mind. There is a love scene, but no graphic nudity. To my recollection there is no real swearing (cursing). There is some gore, but again, tame by the standards of today's R-rated movies.

I won't give away the plot, as the less you know about the movie before viewing, the more you will get out of it. In short, it is a stylistic piece of horror set against a historical backdrop. Many scenes are set against the rural English countryside and village which adds to the atmospheric intrigue. The ending is not easily forgotten and may really shock younger viewers.

A good, creepy, Halloween movie starring Vincent Price.",1254700800,,1151,4.803030303030303
152762,4,0792845552,I saw this on the big screen when it was initially released.  It seemed a bit more frightening.  I review Vincent Price's performance as being quite good.

152763,4,0792845552,"Witchfinder General (though American audiences might know it as The Conqueror Worm), released in 1968, is probably one of his better performances int he set as well as being the most disturbing of his career.  In this flick Price plays Mathew Hopkins, a lawyer and professional witch finder/executor, a character that's based on an actual witch inquisitor.  While making his way through England torturing and executing ""confessed"" witches (whether they are guilty or not), Hopkins is summoned to a small town at the behest of the populace to look into a local priest.  It just so happens that the priest is the uncle of Sarah Lowes, whose fianc (Richard Marshall, played by Ian Ogilvy) is a Roundhead fighting against the Royalists.  After Hopkins tortures and executes Sarah's uncle Richard comes back to find his soon to be wife in quite a state (she had offered herself to Hopkins in exchange for her uncle's safety and was inadvertently raped by Hopkins' assistant in the process.)  Richard vows revenge on Hopkins, stopping at nothing to see him pay for what he's done.

The film was very well made with a startlingly non-camp performance from Price (a feat which young auteur director Michael Reeves accomplished by constantly questioning Price's acting choices unexplained to a point where Price ended up reeling in his typical black humor.)  The film was pretty brutal for the time, and much more so than Price seems to typically make.  I think it's because the material was handle very realistically and straight forward with no actual witchcraft or crazy plot devices.  I was also surprised by the very downbeat ending, also a rarity in Price's oeuvre.",1244678400,,1662,4.992753623188406
152764,1,0792845552,"I feel cheated by this DVD. The best scene has been cut in which a group of women are tried, lots of sadistic torture, very intense. It is the pivotal scene in the movie and has been cut unjustly. Unrated? Bull. The stink of censors is all over this.",1238630400,11,250,4.122448979591836
152765,4,0792845552,"Released in 1968, the British film ""Witchfinder General"" (originally known as ""The Conqueror Worm"" in the USA) details the infamous witch-finding exploits of Matthew Hopkins in Eastern England circa 1645-1647. Hopkins (Vincent Price) and his colleague John Stearne travel from village to village brutally torturing ""confessions"" out of suspected witches and charging the local magistrates for the ""work"" they carry out.

Some call the film ""the original torture porn"" and I suppose it was pretty radical in 1968, but it never struck me as being a torture-obsessed film. It always struck as a British Western with a simple rape/murder/revenge plot: A soldier's beautiful fianc is savagely raped and her Uncle, a Priest, tortured & murdered for supposedly being a witch. When the soldier (Ian Ogilvy) finds out he vows revenge.

Don't get me wrong, this is a good film, it's just that it always came across to me as more of a Western than a torture film. The only death that I found truly unsettling was the one where a woman is burned to death by being lowered into a bonfire. That scene definitely has a lasting impact.

The writer/director was Michael Reeves, a promising young filmmaker. Unfortunately he died of an accidental barbiturate overdose not long after the film was released at the way-too-young age of 25. The dosage was too marginal to suggest suicide; besides, he was already busy working on another film project.

Reeves and star Vincent Price reportedly didn't get along. Reeves originally wanted Donald Pleasence for the title role but the studio forced Price on him and he had to rewrite the script accordingly. Reeves mainly objected to Price's hammy acting style and did everything he could to get Price to play it straight. He would say things like, ""Please, Vincent, try to say it without rolling your eyes."" At one point Price pointed out to Reeves, ""I've made 87 films, what have you done?"" The director responded, ""Made three good ones"" (LOL!!).

After seeing the film the following year Price admitted that he finally saw what Reeves was trying to do and wrote him a 10-page letter praising the film (!). After Reeve's death Price stated: ""I (finally) realized what he wanted was a low-key, very laid-back, menacing performance. He did get it, but I was fighting him almost every step of the way. Had I known what he wanted I would have cooperated.""

The film is only partially accurate as far as history goes, although the gist is true. Hopkins was in his mid-20s when he committed his atrocities, not almost 60 as was the case with Price. Also, Hopkins & Stearne were accompanied by female assistants. As far as Hopkins' death goes, tradition tells us that disgruntled villagers caught him and subjected him to his own ""swimming test,"" although there's no actual evidence to support this; most historians believe he died of tuberculosis at his home shortly after his torturous escapades in 1647 (only 27 years old).

One of the film's highlights for me is Hilary Dwyer, who plays the soldier's fianc/wife. She's just a uniquely beautiful woman all around and a pleasure to behold.

Another strong point is the ending which ***SPOILER ALERT*** depicts the soldier mad with rage hacking someone to death while his just-tortured fianc screams and screams. The evil inflicted upon them has brought them to this point of maniacal frenzy. It's reality, my friend. Despite the rather downbeat ending I've always viewed it as somehow uplifting for obvious reasons. There's no reason we shouldn't assume the soldier and his wife move on to live a happy life together. ***END SPOILER***

Some make it a point to stress that ""Witchfinder General"" is not a Hammer film but rather American International. Regardless, the picture is a British film made at the time when Hammer was in its prime; it therefore has that Hammer vibe, which is why some mistake it for a Hammer picture. Needless to say, if you like Hammer films you'll appreciate this.

At the same time, ""Witchfinder General"" stands apart; it has its own uniqueness, no doubt due to Reeve's burgeoning genius. As such, the film is special to me. Some of the photography is hauntingly beautiful; the protagonists -- the noble soldier and the lovely Sarah -- are exceptional; the villains dastardly; and the ending innovative.

So why not a higher rating? Because, as special as this film is, it's not the most engrossing saga. Artistically, it's gets an 'A' for a low-budget film from that era but, story-wise, they could've made it more compelling.

The film runs a short-but-sweet 87 minutes and was shot in Suffolk & Norfolk, England.

GRADE: B",1234742400,5,4623,4.934362934362935
152766,5,0792845552,"I found Vincent Prices performance in this movie delightful as with most his work.  For some reason his role felt perfect for him and his presence onscreen is fantastic to see.  This is the type of movie that I could of seen really happening during witch trials given the time period.  The craziness of people were getting the best of them and would surely go along with these men or be cut down themselves.  I had never heard of Witchfinder till a couple days ago and found certain parts to make me say ""ouch"".  The movie really didn't have much to do with actual witch hunting as so much as the time period.  I felt so much more could of been done to create a feeling of dread amongst mass so called witch killing.  I guess most people have an idea of what did occur at the time but there just wasn't enough witch hunting to go along with the title.  It did show corruption that could go along with such a power position.  Though given the brutality it kind of made up for the lack of hunting.  I did feel the movie came apart close to the end when it turned more into a revenge flick instead of a cleaver departure of the villain.  Vincent was a very dark figure along with his goons in this film and you hope for revenge but I necessarily didn't want it.  I was hoping for more story and less revenge but I guess that is how this story goes.  Vincent Price is the biggest reason to watch this flick since he always shines in his roles even if a film stinks.  Witchfinder is one of Vincent Prices more violent and darker flicks than what I have seen so far though I haven't seen absolutely all of his films but I have seen a lot.

The video and audio quality is very nice on the dvd with nice color.  The special features include a interview and I think a trailer but that's basically it.  Overall fans of Vincent Price should not miss even though this movie is kind of hit or miss.",1231286400,,1885,4.206128133704736
152767,2,0792845552,"Seriously, this movie is not worth the more than 3 stars many people give it.  Yes, give credit to Price for playing a vile character sans the usual ""camp"" factor, but that praise on its own makes neither his acting nor the whole of this film great.  I found myself fast forwarding through several sections that would have offered nothing more if I let them play at normal speed.  This type of ""self-editing"" we do on occasion with movies at home just goes to show some professional editing should have been done in the first place.  In fact, I'd go as far as to say it should have been edited to the degree of a whole new film, that would better serve Price's resume and our viewing pleasure.

Some complain they don't know how this is categorized as ""horror"" -- I don't know where or if it is, but I don't think it was intended to be.  Although the Witchmaker General does inspire TERROR amongst those he chooses to target for torture and the stake.  That being said, I did miss the usual lavish, rich, and gothic sets from Price's Poe-inspired movies.

This movie is a one-timer for viewing.",1225843200,3,1094,4.4623115577889445
152768,4,0792845552,"This British horror film from 1968 is definitely worth a look.  Price gives a career best performance as the evil, self-serving Matthew Hopkins, who abuses his position as Witchfinder General in order to satisfy his own vices - all the while condemning vice in others.  It's an adult, disturbing movie, which captures the raw quality of seventeenth century English life, while reflecting back some of the sexual preoccupations of the late 1960s.  It also speaks to our own era, in that it deals with corruption and depravity at the top.  The ending is bleak, and terrifying, and will stay with you a long time after you have put the DVD safely back in its box.",1222646400,2,660,4.71304347826087
152769,4,0792845552,"Everybody loved Vincent Price.  In the 60s and 70s, he was crowned the King of Horror but no matter how many horror movies he appeared in, people still loved the guy.  He could do horror classics like MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM or THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM or show up as the villain Egghead on TV's ""Batman"" or even pop up in a cameo in a Frankie & Annette Beach movie...and everyone still liked him, no matter what he did.

Then he did THE WITCHFINDER GENERAL.

When I saw it as a kid, it was called THE CONQUEROR WORM and, years later, Vincent would show up on ""The Tonight Show"" with Johnny Carson to do a dramatic reading of that Poe poem about a maggot.  I wonder if this is on youtube.  I'll always remember his delivery: ""...for the play is the tragedy, Man...and its hero...the conqueror worm.""

As a lot of other reviews here state, THE WITCHFINDER GENERAL is probably Vincent Price's greatest performance.  He is diabolical here but with none of the campy fun of his other films.  He is sinister, corrupt, evil.  That he tears through the countryside as a gov't/church-sanctioned official only makes him more repellent and horrible.

I remember reading an interview with Vincent and he said making this movie was an unpleasant experience for him.  He didn't get along with the director or, if I remember right, the director's personality was darker than Vincent wanted to deal with!  The director died of a drug overdose but--again, if I remember this correctly--Vincent was turned off by his dark side and his interest in Satanism (does anyone else remember that?  The director was into Satan worship or something).

Witchfinder General (aka Conqueror Worm) is an extraordinary film.  It's one of a handful of features directed by Michael Reeves.  This is the film he's most famous for, and it's as bleak and as terrifying as you've heard.  It's not a ""gorehound"" film (even though there's gore galore in it); it's an immensely intelligent film.  It takes place during the English Civil War where law and order had pretty much broken down, and local magistrates were running amok.  Frequently, witch hunters were employed to rid the countryside of ""wrongdoers"" (or people they just didn't like), and Matthew Hopkins (played by Vincent Price) was one of these men.  Hopkins was a real witch hunter, but this story is not completely based on fact.

The film, despite its limited budget, is wonderfully shot in the English countryside, giving it a really gentle flavour at times, which is ironic, as the film is very violent and cruel.  It's not a happy film, in fact, quite brutal and bleak.  The torture scenes are incredibly brutal and realistic, and are very difficult to watch, as they are not slick like modern Hollywood.  The veneer of civilization is lifted, and the underbelly of society comes out with a venegance.

This, I believe, is Vincent Price's best performance.  Here he drops the campiness and hamminess and shows that he was a great, brilliant actor.  He plays it entirely cold, giving his performance a shade of sadism and cruelty, something not found in his other work.  Michael Reeves, the director, was rather distant from Price, which angered Vincent deeply.  Vincent later admitted that Reeves's treatment of him enabled him to give the cold, dispassionate performance you see here.

The film has been hard to find in its original version.  The BBFC (the British Film Censorship board) made Reeves cut the most violent scenes from the film.  Reeves insisted on the scenes staying in, claiming that they were realistic depictions of the torture that went on during Matthew Hopkins's time.  Surprisingly, the film wasn't cut at all for its U.S. release.  The only things that AIP Pictures did to the film was put on a prologue and epilogue with Vincent Price reading an Edgar Allen Poe poem, and retitling the film Conqueror Worm (they did this to tie the film into their other Edgar Allen Poe adaptations).  They also used a different score for their release.  On this DVD, you get the official cut from Michael Reeves (the commentary on the DVD by the co-producer says this DVD is in fact Reeves's original version).  There is also commentary by Ian Oglivy (the 2nd lead actor in the film) and the co-producer, and a featurette on Michael Reeves, who died shortly after making this film.  This is quite an extraordinary film considering the time it was made, its budget, and the inexperienced director.

The story is fictionalized, but there is nothing fictional in the sadism and avarice depicted in the witchhunters, nor in the suffering depicted in the innocent victims.  The violence shown here makes one reflect on the evil wrought on innocent women and men in the name of religion in 17th-century Europe.

Vincent Price gives a taut performance that has none of the camp or black humor he displayed in movies like ""House on Haunted Hill.""  He plays Matthew Hopkins as the supremely evil and obsessed villian he probably really was.  Price evokes no sympathy from the audience in his chilling portrayal of Hopkins, and this was probably his greatest performance in a motion picture.  Ian Ogilvy is also convincing as the dashing Captain Marshall.  The story plays like real life and leaves one disquieted.

152793,5,0792845552,"Every lover of film has had a pivotal film experience, the movie that made such an impact on them that they have never forgotten it. For me WITCHFINDER GENERAL is that film. I first saw it in 1969 as THE CONQUERER WORM (AIP's American release title designed to cash in on the Vincent Price/Edgar Allan Poe series although the movie has nothing to do with Poe). I was 17 years old, just about to complete my junior year of high school in Greenville SC, and was a big fan of the Roger Corman/Vincent Price Poe series. I had seen very few films that would not qualify as G rated. The ratings system had just been introduced the year before and this film was rated M (for mature audiences, later GP then PG). It was a complete shock to the system in every way. It was the first time I had seen nudity/lovemaking before and the violence was painful and ugly. Vincent Price was cold and hard without a trace of his usual mannerisms and therefore not sympathetic in the least. To top it all off there was no happy ending and people were worse off than they were before. Of course these things had been in films since the silent era but it was the first time I had seen them and we always remember our firsts.

I have seen just about everything in the movies since then but seeing WITCHFINDER nearly 40 years later I'm amazed at how well it holds up. I am happy to report that after years of substandard VHS and Region 2 DVD editions this version features the original director's cut and restores the original soundtrack which was not available in America. An added bonus is the commentary which features star Ian Ogilvy that fills in the background of the making of the film. For those who don't know, the film is set during the English Civil War and pits two young lovers against a sadistic Puritan witchfinder.

I prefer him in a slightly more campy role like the scorned, vengeful actor in THEATER OF BLOOD, but his cold, sadistic demeanor in this film is just right for the part.
Apparently, this disk is the old American version rather than the uncut version I bought a while back from Brazil called ""O CACADOR DE BRUXAS.""  This beautfully produced, import version of the film (which includes the original English sound track) contains some lovely nude scenes that were never shown in the U.S. version.
Too bad MGM didn't put WITCHFINDER GENERAL out sooner.  I'd have never discovered this Brazilian gem if I had been able to find a domestic version of the film.  If MGM's version lacks these scenes, which apparently it does, I'm forced to give their Witchfinder General a 4 rating.  The Brazilian version gets a well deserved 5!!",1187740800,7,1014,4.935294117647059

I can only imagine that these people's knowledge of Vinny P. is limited to this movie, because anyone who has actually watched an excellent Price movie like ""House on Haunted Hill"" or ""Last Man On Earth"" would view this slice of British 60's schlock as just what it is: an awful film.  Boring, preachy and utterly predictable, ""Witchfinder General"" also mixes in a healthy dose of nihilism and hopelessness just to make everything that much harder to take.  I would not buy this movie and I wouldn't recommend that anyone should watch it.  Although a friend of mine, who likes to go on and on about how evil the Catholic Church is, actually claims to like this movie.

152810,3,0792845552,"Back in 1971 I saw CONQUEROR WORM on the bottom of a QUADRUPLE feature of horror films at the Venus Theatre in Houston, TX. I've never forgotten it. I've never been ABLE to. I think director Michael Reeves would be proud of that fact. I went in expecting a film with SOME sort of supernatural aspects. Instead I saw a ""HISTORICAL Horror Film"", depicting the real-life persecution and legalized MURDER of those who happen to be on the wrong side of the English Civil War. In the midst of it, Vincent Price plays the single most irredeemably EVIL [...] of his entire career!

AIP pulled a serious con job on US audiences by retitling WITCHFINDER GENERAL to try and pass it off as a ""Poe"" film. Apart from the rather appropriate excerpt read in his usual classic style by Price, it has nothing to do with Poe, and with its shoestring budget looks and feels nothing like any of the other films in AIP's series. We're talking down-and-dirty ""realism"" in the manner of the Monty Python historicals-- but there's nothing even remotely funny here. It's one of the most viscious, vile, dispicable things ever committed to film. Despite this, it features 2 of my all-time favorite actors, stunningly beautiful landscapes & photography and sweeping, romantic music. All of this seems to work as tremendous contrast to the excessively BRUTAL violence and lengthy torture scenes, all of which contain what I'd call ""real world"" SCREAMING rather than ""movie-style"" screaming. The director, the LATE Michael Reeves, allowed his singlular obsession with proving the danger of violence to overwhelm his work, and made it hard to get his point across to audiences. The violence escalates as the story continues. You keep hoping things will turn around... THEY DON'T! The situation gets worse and worse and WORSE, UNTIL-- the climax, when the hero breaks loose (in part because the villain wanted him to get a close look at his wife SUFFERING!!) and attacks Price with an AXE. It may be the most violent death scene in Price's career-- but after all his character did over the entire length of the film, IT'S TOO GOOD FOR HIM!!!!! The hero apparently went completely insane, and the film ends with his wife SCREAMING in reaction to it all for nearly a whole minute. I recall leaving the theatre completely disgusted, whatever movie-going innnocence I may have still had at that age completely destroyed. This makes BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES look like a kiddie film.

The only time I ever ran across an interview with Ian Ogilvy, it was in an issue of FANTASTIC FILMS, and they were discussing his very good friend-- the LATE director! I suddenly discovered that this APPALLINGLY offensive piece of film-making had starred Ogilvy, who 10 years later became one of my favorite actors for his portrayal of Simon Templar in RETURN OF THE SAINT.

He described how Reeves wanted Donald Pleasence-- but Vincent Price was under contract, so that's who he got forced on him. Reeves drove poor Vincent mad on the film, continually badgering him about his ""style"". Like... ""You're doing that THING."" ""What thing?"" ""THERE! You're doing it AGAIN!!!""

At the UK premiere, a woman in the press corp stood up halfway thru the film and addressed the crowd, saying, ""This film is utterly DEPRAVED, and so are ALL of you unless you leave with me right now!"" She left, they stayed... Later, after the Hollywood premiere, Vincent wrote Reeves a 3-page letter, thanking him profusely. He told him he finally ""got"" what the guy was after, and thanked him for bringing out of him the best acting performance of his career! Good grief. (Knowing Price, I'm sure he was sincere. Someone else might have been sarcastic, but he's too sweet a guy!)

Years back a friend told me he saw the film in a theatre with his then-girlfriend, and they were so offended they walked out 15 minutes before it was over. I started laughing, and told him how ""lucky"" he was-- because he missed the WORST part! --and THEN I told him WHAT he missed. Some things don't leave you.

When Channel 3 in Philly ran it on SATURDAY NIGHT DEAD with ""Stella, the Maneater from Manyunk"" (don't be fooled, she was really from the Mafia neighborhood in South Philly), it was CUT profusely. In fact, I'd swear 5 of the last 10 minutes were cut!!! Guess what? It IMPROVED the picture! (At least now it's watchable.)

For years I envisioned what the film might have been like if the director had had more taste, more sense, and more ""restraint"". Then one day I saw HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS. In that film, Price gets killed in the EXACT same fashion as this one-- hacked to pieces with an axe. But it was so artfully done, with quick camera cuts, close-up reaction shots and the action seen only in a silhouette on the wall, I realized it was EXACTLY as I pictured the climax of CONQUEROR WORM should have been-- but wasn't. I know Reeves was trying to make an important point, in an era of people whose senses were being DULLED to the effects of violence, but I often wonder if he couldn't have gotten his point across much better if he'd just had the maturity to match his ambition. The STORY itself is disturbing enough-- EVEN with every single bit of violence cut.

In addition to Price & Oilvy, neat cameos to watch for are Patrick Wymark (WHERE EAGLES DARE) as Oliver Cromwell, leader of the war against the King, and Wilfred Brambell (""Johnny McCartney"", Paul's grandfather, from A HARD DAY'S NIGHT!) as a horse trader.

Around the same time I taped this I also managed to see CRY OF THE BANSHEE. I was surprised that that film had almost the identical plot as this one-- except BANSHEE's plot contains REAL witches and supernatural elements. I enjoyed that film more than this one, but while WITCHFINDER went overboard on violence, BANSHEE went for excesses of nudity-- all of which was cut on TV! Damn.",1155427200,11,5833,4.71078431372549
152811,5,0792845552,"... or maybe the best horror western ever. What you make of this will depend on two things. How much you like old British horror and how much you know about the production of this particular film. When you realize that this is the last production of a young talented Director, Michael Reeves, who died (25 - accidental overdose) on the path to being one of the all time greatest film directors, and that this is his third, last and best film, you will under its value (as an example of his talent watch the shot in this film of young children cooking potatoes in the ashes of a `witch' that has just been burned). It is a notch above your average late 1960s early 1970s horror films. In fact it is a notch above nearly every British film making it one of the British modern classics.

The story is based on the real life times and crimes of the lawyer and Witchfinder General - Mathew Hopkins, who set about destroying alleged witches across England with the full power of the law. This film depicts the various acts of torture and trials conducted on witches making it an extremely important historical document (as a note the Western influence comes from the gallant long countryside horseback riding shots, mobs in the villages and things like gallows being erected in the same vein as the cowboy movies in the USA of that era. It WORKS extremely well!) It is also certainly the best rendition of such grim persecutions to date on the screen (US viewers should think Salem Witch Trials x 100).

There is an interesting plot involving a young soldier whose fiance's father - a priest, is put on trial for witchcraft while the soldier is away. When the soldier returns he vows to track down Hopkins for the crimes he has committed against his wife and father and so the movie is essentially a story of revenge as this soldier chases Hopkins across the countryside passing through villages where Hopkins has been.

Some find this film hard to watch because of this subplot but stick with it because after the first twenty minutes or so the film really takes off. This is also Vincent Price in his best role ever and some would say his best work although the production values are somewhat low (a very restrictive budget with a young director practically making it by himself). Many of the scenes are underexposed, dirty, bad cuts, lots of zooms (a no-no in cinematography these days), daft credits that almost underexpose Hopkins face in the background and other elements of film making associated with tight finances. However ALL of the fight sequences and torture sequences are very well done. In fact some of those scenes had to be cut!

The real gem in this movie though is to know how much it has been through. The director set out to make one of the most violent films ever conceived in the UK. The UK censors immediately cut it to ribbons saying that it would shock the viewers too much. Also the US censors agreed that the violence should be toned down considerably but agreed that the US version could contain different takes with nude women. This led to several versions of the film over the years.

This review refers to the superb DVD version of the film. You can only currently get it on PAL but it contains 2 versions of the films, excellent bonus materials including documentaries, Empire Magazine's Kim Newman provides excellent production notes (best seen on any DVD to date), trailers and biographies. It is dirt cheap. Get it!

Anyway the DVD has 2 versions - The Directors Cut (featuring NO nude women and all the restored cuts) and the Export Version (featuring nude women and all the restored cuts). The VHS version is CUT. However this decade one scene was restored that was originally omitted from the screen version - of the infamous boot in the eye sequence. So all new VHS versions of the film have this restored... but the DVD has also restored - (1) A priest being tortured, (2) A women being slapped, (3)An extended version of the river dunking, (4)A witch missing her eye being tied up and burnt alive, (5)A woman being tortured and (6) the notorious axing sequence. Unfortunately these cut scenes had to be restored from a poor quality tape recording in the Director's own personal collection, so these cut scenes look very different from the quality of the actual film - however this is only a minor point given that the film is over 30 years old and was made on a shoe-string budget. The fact that we get to see these cuts at all on a DVD in SUBLIME for fans!

So for the first time ever - The Fully Restored - Witchfinder General as it was meant to be seen is now available!

152813,3,0792845552,"""The Conqueror Worm"" is the American title of ""Witchfinder General,"" which was sold -- deceitfully -- by American International as part of the Edgar Allan Poe cycle (a dubbed-in recitation of Poe's poem ""The Conqueror Worm"" by Vincent Price is its only connection).  While ""Conqueror Worm"" contains all of the picture elements of the available British version (though the version released to theatres in 1968 was even more graphic in the torture scenes), the superlative music score by Paul Ferris did not make the transition and was replaced by an initially pleasing, but quickly repetitive and inadequate synthesizer theme (in some scenes the music simply runs out, then starts over again like its on a loop).  Even so, this grim historical thriller features one of Vincent Price's all time best performances as Matthew Hopkins, a powerful man with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Price was not so much directed by Michael Reeves as goaded by him (Reeves really wanted Donald Pleasence for the role and was bitter over having Price forced on him by AIP).  But Price acquiesced and managed to keep the twinkle out of his eye and his tongue out of his cheek, and the result is ferociously evil.  In addition, the settings and costumes are so authentic that you will believe you are really watching the 17th century play out before you.

152814,5,0792845552,"The masterful direction of Michael Reeves has blended cracking adventure, achingly beautiful photography, inspired use of violence/horror, a genuinely moving love story and a memorable stirring score into, quite simply, one of the best British movies of all time.

Reeves coaxed a life-time best performance from veteran actor Vincent Price (I'll leave the viewer to discover the delightful anecdote about this in the accompanying documentary), as Matthew Hopkins. No Abominable Dr Phibes here! Price keeps the hamminess in check to deliver a genuinely chilling and convincing performance. His assistant, the utterly egotistical and brutal John Stearne, is superbly played by Robert Russell.  Ian Ogilvy and Hilary Dwyer are also magnificent as the young lovers, who have the misfortune to cross the path of the Witchfinder.  The tender beauty of their love scene generates a huge amount of empathy with the lovers and contrasts most markedly with the horrors to come.

Some elements of very black gallows humour - the kids roasting their potatoes in the post-execution fire, and a cheeky cameo from 'old man Steptoe', were truly inspired, but Reeves brutally realistic (some would argue pessimistic) view of humanity, leads us to the inevitable jaw-droppingly stark and bleak conclusion.

From comments in previous reviews, it appears that the US VHS release has butchered this movie, even shockingly stripping away the excellent score, so go for the (UK) Region 0 DVD instead, available through Amazon UK.

The DVD presentation is generally good, although the additional scenes from the export version are of noticeably poorer picture quality with apparently no attempt having been made to digitally restore them. This is a shame, as some of the interrogation scenes and the tavern scenes with John Stearne are genuinely compelling. The audio - Dolby mono, is adequately clear, but with the occasional soupcon of distortion.  The extras include the theatrical trailer, production notes and, importantly, an excellent and revealing documentary about the tragically short life of the hugely talented Michael Reeves.

If you like a movie with a feel-good ending, then don't touch this DVD with a 16-foot Civil War pike, but if you enjoy very powerful, memorable and disturbing cinema, then the masterpiece that is Witchfinder General (bizarrely re-titled 'Conqueror Worm' in the USA) is an indispensable purchase.",1110672000,8,2412,5.413333333333333

152818,5,0792845552,"first off, i'll come out and say that i don't care about the petty feuds between Vincent and the director, or the star and director of any movie! from what i've learned, Reeves was acting like he was a hot shot and by 1968 Vincent was a LEGEND and knew his way around acting and when he questioned the director about something, Reeves coldly replied that Vincent was clueless and his entire career was meaningless. now, had this been a stuffy or an egotistical celebrity i wouldn't have a problem but my god, Vincent Price? He was one of the least egotistical people in the profession and he didn't take himself seriously, and because of this it allowed him to spoof himself in the later years and have fun with his image. Reeves also never visited or checked up on Vincent after an accident happened on the set: Vincent fell off a horse and Reeves purposely ignored Vincent hoping the anger would come across on film! this 1968 film on witch-craft and Matthew Hopkins shows what a great actor Vincent was. Who else had the versatility to do this intense film but yet a year prior he was cavorting around as Dr. Goldfoot in two films as well as appearing as Egghead on the TV show ""Batman""! Vincent is often ignored and his LONG career (1935-1992) is constantly being down-played by critics who prescribe the silly notion that horror movies are bad and anyone who gets a kick out of them are bad for society. such garbage! Matthew Hopkins, as played by Vincent, isn't lovable or hammy as we all love Vincent to be...this is probably the only role of his where the viewer has no sympathy and you cheer on his eventual comeuppance and this one is a doozy! it IS a horror movie because it has all the elements: violence, evil, blood, death, intensity, scream queens, and atmosphere...and because this is an AIP film there are several shots of nude women but it's all in context of the story so don't anyone out there yell ""X rated"" or something silly like that. This movie inspired Vincent's 1970 film ""Cry of the Banshee"", which i also love. another witch-craft/voo-doo film from this era from Vincent is the wonderful ""Oblong Box"". but ""Conqueror Worm"" a/k/a ""Witchfinder General"" is fantastic.",1079568000,2,2193,4.640102827763497
152819,5,0792845552,"Why one of the reviewers here insists on calling this a Hammer movie I don't know. It certainly isn't, and never was. I saw this on its initial release in 1968, and its dark power burned a hole in my psyche. It was released on a double bill with ""Blood Beast Terror"", starring Peter Cushing (and also NOT a Hammer film). The production outfit was an enterprising competitor of Hammer's called Tigon Pictures. The billing with the Cushing epic (an endearing thriller about a vampire moth), tells you that this movie was unfairly promoted (and trailed) as a horror pic. While it certainly is horrific, even sitting in the Sadean tradition of UK movies like ""Peeping Tom"" and ""Circus of Horrors"", it really transcends all genres, including the historical epic, while employing tropes from many diverse genres.
I asked Ian Ogilvy for his recollections of the movie a few years ago, but he seemed - strangely - not to understand what a masterpiece he'd been involved with ... he told me, for example, that filming the scene in the church, wherein Richard pledges vengeance, he'd felt it to be both sentimental and slightly silly. Rumors and gossip abound about the filming of the movie, and you can read some interesting anecdotes from contributors on the IMDB.com pages dealing with ""Witchfinder General"". For instance, Vincent Price to the director Michael Reeves: ""I've made over 70 movies, what have YOU done?"" Reeves: ""Made three good ones.""
It was also interesting when some years ago I visited the village of Lavenham, where much of the movie takes place, to hear recollections of the townspeople, many of whom appeared in the movie, and all of whom adored Vincent Price as a real gentleman. A pity Price never acknowledged publicly that ""Witchfinder General"" featured his best movie performance. Two other points: Johnny Coquillon's photography makes this movie what it is ... that, and Paul Ferris's ORIGINAL music score with its haunting ""Greensleeves""-inspired melodies, which was foolishly washed out of the US release and replaced with generic soapy schmaltz. Perhaps this is at heart a movie for Brits (particularly ex-pats like me?) who adored the English landscape and sensed something terrible emerging in the collective unconscious during the late sixties that belied the pastoral hippie dream.  The original version ended with a freeze frame of Hilary Dwyer, at the moment of her greatest anguish, and darkness has won, and we are all in hell. At this point in the American-International release, Poe's ""Conqueror Worm"" is inserted on the soundtrack to justify packaging the movie as a Price/Poe flick, brutalizing the movie and wrecking its original dark vision. I understand a DVD is available now with original score restored - I can only hope the ending, too, is given back to Reeves's vision. Incidentally, Michael Reeves's ""Sorcerers"", made just before ""Witchfinder"", anticipated the vicarious thrills of snuff movies and the Internet by decades, and contains one of Boris Karloff's finest performances. We mourn the loss of Reeves, but in his brief career he created at least one enduring masterpiece, and it's called ""Witchfinder General"".",1062028800,17,3161,5.114119922630561
152820,4,0792845552,"Film director Michael Reeves' 1969 ""The Conqueror Worm"" is such a harrowing film, one will look past its many faults including an obvious low budget, poor editing and wooden acting by several supporting performers. Make no doubt, this was strictly a ""B"" goth film made popular by Roger Corman at the time, though Reeves refused to pull any punches in his uncomfortable examination of witch-hunter Matthew Hopkins. Notorious for many reasons, including the suicide of young director Reeves soon after completing this film, especially intense scenes of angst and torture, and what must rank as Vincent Price's most villainous performance, ""The Conqueror Worm"" will stay with the viewer.
The unremitting tone of this English film must be admired, as Reeves was obviously attempting to reveal the evil within all men, and most certainly the type of paranoid fear and weakness which lead to such witch hunts. The scenes of torture, while intense, are never exploitative. There is an overall unwavering sadness to ""The Conqueror Worm,"" but the film's themes are valid, if not thought-provoking. Reeves should be admired for sticking to his guns, and his feuds with Vincent Price on the set (""Please Vincent, stop rolling your eyes. Try to act natural!"" he reportedly said to Mr. Price) are now part of horror film legend.
It's a fine line this atypical film walks, and all one has to do is view the similar ""Mark of the Devil"" (though I would not recommend it) which was released within the same year. The German film, dealing with the hunting and persecution of witches, chose to emphasize graphic scenes of torture rather than the dark character motivation for such heinous acts. And thus, ""Mark of the Devil"" must rank as one of the most vile films ever made.
I'm not sure one could truly call ""The Conqueror Worm"" vile, but this film is attempting to reveal some dark truths about man. Unconventional and brave, this cheerless tale was one of the most unique horror films during the decade of the 1960s, and serves as an interesting testament to a film director who tragically might have been on the verge of greatness.",1046476800,5,2117,4.916201117318436

Price plays a straight up role as real-life witch-hunter Mathew Hopkins. Set in Cromwell's England during the years of civil war, Conqueror Worm is an excellent historical drama whose horrific effects come from what human beings do to other human beings.
The movie itself is a told in a straightforward textbook manner. The first part introduces the main players and their relationship. Hopkins and his cruel assistant and the priest, his niece and her fiance, a soldier in Cromwell's New Model Army. The second act creates the issue at hand, namely Hopkins cruel torture and killing of the priest, his taking advantage of his niece and her rape by the assistant. The final act is the chase, the soldier tracks Hopkins and ends in a harrowing finale.
The simple formula above is successful because of good writing, directing and acting by all players. Conqueror Worm, made in 1969, is still graphic in it's depiction of sexual and physical violence.

Little does he know as he rides off, pausing to give directions to two strange men, that he just directed Hopkins and his toadie to Sarah and her guardian.
Sarah buys her uncle's life with her body.  But after his toadie rapes her, Hopkins turns against her and permits the priest's death.  Ogilvy returns to find the church destroyed, and Sarah shattered and hiding.  Ogilvy marries her and vows vengeance against Hopkins.
The score sets a poignant tone, the acting is superb with Price in a very non-hammy performance.  It is also notable for being directed by Michael Reeve (Ogilvy's friend and they made Revenge of the Blood Beast and And Now the Screaming Starts together). Reeve showed the promise of being a brilliant director, but he died after the completion of his third film.
The film is disturbing, unsettling, but a great & neglected work.",1035936000,8,1617,4.780575539568345
152823,4,0792845552,"Matthew Hopkins was a self proclaimed Witchfinder who started his career in 1644 in Essex, England. In a three year career he is estimated to have killed between 200 and 400 ""witches"". The Witchfinder General (The Conqueror Worm) is a movie based on his success as a prosecutor of witches.
Witchfinder General is an interesting movie in that it is part horror, part melodrama, part historical epic. Vincent Price has one of his finest and most effective roles ever as Matthew Hopkins in this 1968 British Classic. The movie was renamed The Conqueror Worm for U.S. audiences to try and take advantage of Price's fame from Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe inspired series of movies. Except for reading part of the poem The Conqueror Worm during the ending credits, the movie has nothing to do with Poe.
The basic story is common enough for this sub-genre of horror movies: There is an abusive official who accuses and prosecutes alleged witches for his own personal gain and personal power trips. There are two other fine British films from this time period that deal with the same subject matter, The Devils by Kurt Russell and Mark of the Devil starring Herbert Lom. All three are well made and effective, but Witchfinder General is the darkest of the bunch. The tortures are all brutal and unnerving to watch and there is a lot of screaming in this movie. Price plays Hopkins as overbearing and cold bloodedly cruel. He allows a woman to submit to him sexually to prevent someone from being killed, then tortures and murders the guy anyway, and then later has her tortured and murdered for being a witch. What a guy!
The director of this movie was the young and upcoming Michael Reeves who unfortunately committed suicide in 1969, not long after this movie was released. There was a well known feud of sorts between Reeves and the star, Vincent Price. At one point Price is reputed to have said to the 25 year old director: ""I have made over 70 films, what have you done?"" with a reply from Reeves: ""I have made three good ones"". Perhaps the tension between director and star helped to make this the dark and humorless film that it is. Even 34 years after it's release, it still holds up as a beautifully made movie that hardly looks of feels dated at all. The period movies that Price was making with Roger Corman a few years before this film was made, while still excellent in many respects, are obviously a product of the 60's.
Unfortunately this movie has not been released in the U.S. on dvd. There is a British release that includes a documentary on Michael Reeves, but for now in America all we have is the MGM midnight movie video release...",1035849600,6,2648,4.6481876332622605
152824,3,0792845552,"This film, set in 1645 strife-torn England has Price in a serious role very different from his usual tongue-in-cheek horror flicks. This one is more of an historical drama with violent episodes than a true horroe film. Price plays Matthew Hopkins, a lawyer and witchfinder who journeys from town to town seeking and killing suspected witches, usually women or royalists or Cromwell's supporters or papalists or just about anyone else who is different.
While keeping to the letter of the law, Price and his henchman certainly break the spirit with their cruelty and sadism. THe plot revolves arounf two young lovers, RIchard and Sara, caught in Hopkins web. Sara's uncle, a priest, is accused of witchcraft and is tortured and jailed. Sara, to save his life, seduces Hopkins but eventually is also accused of witchcraft and jailed and tortured. Richard vows revenge against Hopkins. Several more people are burned, hanged, tortured, etc. before the inevitable end.
The film is violent and disturbing. I'm not sure if it's disturbing because it is violent or because it is not violent enough since the real actions that took place would have been more horrific and evil than what could be displayed on film.
It's an upsetting film. Price is good as the zealot who hides behind the law for carrying out his evil intentions. John, his henchman, is a sadist who simply enjoys torturing people and gets away with it. The film is authentic in its portrayal of English life during the Civil Wars with its harsh cruelty, depravity, breakdown of social order, etc.",1030924800,4,1554,4.957854406130268

7792436,5,0792845552,"This is an expensive blu-ray when you consider that this film is from the late 1960's and was never much of a hit at the time. BUT, here's the thing: Witchfinder General is something akin to lightning in a bottle. Reportedly Vincent Price and Michael Reeves (the director) did not get along very well. Price (too often, IMHO, a bit of a ham actor) was ""forced"" to play the part straight. Seriously. Not over the top. He disagreed, but knuckled under grudgingly. When he saw the finished film, he thanked the director for the insistence.

Witchfinder General is actually more of a drama than its often-referred-to ""horror"" moniker. There's no horror here. It is actually a film based on factual events/people. Price is Matthew Hopkins, a real person (though at the time of his witchfinding, was much younger than Price), who stole a royal edict to search out witches. This was convenient for Hopkins, because England was in the midst of a civil war and he was able to take advantage of the times and illegally hunt down witches and then see to their execution.

Though the film takes creative license with events and their timing, there is much VERY MUCH to like here. The drama is real and the acting is superb. Ian Ogilvy is dashing as our hero. Vincent Price's Hopkins is so subtly creepy that you will find yourself uncomfortable.

Not particularly gory - not gory at all really - there are certainly some tense moments when the witches are done-away with.

If you don't expect historical accuracy, but want to learn a bit about what this real life person was doing and get entertained along the way - check this film out!",1476748800,8,1625,4.671328671328672

The movie itself is Blu-ray and it plays / looks fantastic. If that is all you are buying this movie for - go ahead because the movie looks great. It you like buying DVD's / Blu-rays for the EXTRAS you will be disappointed because the EXTRAS on the Blu-ray disc are PAL formatted and WILL NOT play on Blu-ray players in the US.
