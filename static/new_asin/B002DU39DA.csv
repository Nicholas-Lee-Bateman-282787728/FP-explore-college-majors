8366052,4,B002DU39DA,"What can I say about this show? An early seventies cult classic. I remember seeing just a few episodes in Austin, where I grew up. But I remember it well, and it is very nostalgic for me. Definitely dated. But fun for the cheesy factor. clusters Vincent Price, and this dude that's practically every character on the show, and this big guy name Igor that you get used to, he's pretty good. Lots of repetitious episodes, since it was a daily or weekly show. Probably if you're from Canada it is more nostalgic for you. Not for those with a lack of attention span. A quaint children's classic-monster show that was still a great fad back in the seventies.",1423094400,3,653,4.495798319327731
8366053,5,B002DU39DA,"I remember watching this Canadian horror show every day after school and wondering where the heck it came from!  I was a kid in the US and it just seemed like this show was from another planet.  And that's a good thing!!!

All these years later, it is great to revisit this show, now in its original Canadian episodes (the US episodes were modified, edited versions) and it's still goofy and silly, but kids will love it.  And I think I like it more as an adult now, seeing Billy Van tackle so many different characters, and of course having Vincent Price as well!

This DVD set is great, obviously not all the episodes included (there were so MANY!!!) and a lot of the werewolf DJ segments will never be legally available because of music rights issues, but overall, the producers of this DVD collection did everything they could to bring you as many episodes uncut as possible!  Excellent!!!",1394150400,3,893,4.584905660377358
8366054,1,B002DU39DA,"When my package arrived, I found that the cover box was the same as pictured above, but underneath was some B grade direct-to-video horror movie that I wouldn't pay $5.00 for.  I shipped it back and got a refund, naturally. I still don't know if this was a scam or just gross incompetence.  In any case, I can't rate the product because I never actually received it.",1392422400,2,366,4.447761194029851
