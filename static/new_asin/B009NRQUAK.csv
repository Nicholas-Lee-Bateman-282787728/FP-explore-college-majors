8543210,4,B009NRQUAK,"JUST HENRY relates the plight of a boy growing up in a small Yorkshire town, circa 1950. He misses his WWII hero dad, doesn't like school and doesn't see much point to it even though a new inspiring teacher helps in this regard, and meets Grace, a very interesting girl who finds herself caught between Henry and his mortal foe, Paul. Like many BBC films, JUST HENRY does a fine job of meshing light, charming, funny moods with some very serious conflicts. Not a lot of frills and/or fast action, just an evenly paced film with a some truly memorable characters. Some really tense and unexpected stuff happens toward the end.

JUST HENRY is based upon a novel by Michelle Magorian, and several of the IMDB reviews criticize it for doing paltry justice to the book. All I know is that I enjoyed this film, and if the novel is much better (which is often the case), then I look forward to reading it.",1378080000,4,898,4.475609756097561
