2865159,5,B000RETOH4,I am very impressed with the purchase of this item.  It was priced well below everyone else and delivered exactly when promised.,1270252800,,128,4.818181818181818
2865160,5,B000RETOH4,"Both of these movies are very funny. ""The Whole Nine Yards came first and then the spin off 'The Whole Ten Yards."" They both have equal comedy moments, which is unusual in sequels.  Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis bounce of each other very well which makes for a great comedy team.  There are extras on both films.  I'd like to see these two actors team up on some more films.

Buy this package deal and you won't be sorry, I highly recommend them.",1268784000,7,447,4.349397590361446
2865161,5,B000RETOH4,"The Whole Nine Yards/The Whole Ten Yards are two very good movies. They are very comedic. If you like Bruce Willis, you should really see both of these movies.",1255478400,,159,4.517241379310345
2865162,4,B000RETOH4,"An enjoyable double header with comedy, connivance and convoluted plots. Nine is better than ten, but only by a yard or so. They are both light comedy with dumb crooks, lucky heroes and a dash of romance. A great alternative when Big Brother is the only thing on the TV.",1223769600,8,270,4.42
2865163,5,B000RETOH4,"In case you were wondering, this is a double sided DVD with the main features and the special features the way they were orginally released, so it really is like having two DVDs for the price of one.",1197590400,19,199,4.2631578947368425

2865180,4,B000RETOH4,The Whole Nine Yards is classic comedy.  The Whole Ten Yards isn't worth the time it takes to watch it.  That's the reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5.,1472515200,,154,4.1

2865228,5,B000RETOH4,"Who knew that when you put Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry together in the same movie that it would be as hilarious as it turns out to be, in not just one movie, but two.  The supporting casts add to the plot and romance that often seems to accompany planned chaos.

2865237,5,B000RETOH4,"Arrived early and in the condition as promised. These movies are so so funny. When you need a good ,serious laugh  this will be a good movie to try. Most of the characters are hired killers but it is truly funny.  I loved it",1395360000,,224,4.068181818181818
2865238,4,B000RETOH4,Not what you'd expect out of Bruce Willis.  Has unexpected twists and turns.  Willis and Perry play well together and the women are good in their roles.,1394582400,,152,4.592592592592593
2865239,5,B000RETOH4,The first movie was hilarious and odd but the sequel was almost as good as the original. Both well  worth watching.,1392508800,,115,4.476190476190476

2865241,5,B000RETOH4,I LOVE this movie!  It is one of the few movies I can watch time and time again.  Mathew Perry has the best comedic timing and excels at physical comedy.  And I love that Bruce Willis can deliver great lines with a stone cold expression but still make me laugh! I tried to find this double feature locally (walmart) but had no luck. Thanks Amazon!,1389052800,,347,4.3076923076923075
2865242,5,B000RETOH4,"These two movies are humorous and were ""just what the doctor ordered"" as my father is battling cancer.  He is able to have both movies in a single case which keeps storage to a minimum.  My only recommendation would be that the actual disc is more clearly marked as to which movie is on each side.",1388534400,,297,4.285714285714286

2865244,5,B000RETOH4,This is a great comedy featuring Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis. It will keep you laughing and in suspense at the same time wondering what's going to happen next. This is a must buy!,1380585600,,182,4.382352941176471
2865245,1,B000RETOH4,It was billed as a double feature but there is only one film. Should I have received the Whole ten yards as well?,1378425600,,113,3.9565217391304346
2865246,1,B000RETOH4,"Perhaps I grew up or something, but these used to make me laugh. Now it's just violent and not funny at all. If you want to enjoy Matthew Perry's sense of humor, than Friends is the way to go. And if you like Bruce Willis's ability to be a strong dude, than get Die Hard or Armageddon. I don't know.....just did not enjoy these movies",1377302400,,334,4.153846153846154
2865247,5,B000RETOH4,Nine js far better than ten but ten is not bad. It is worth it for just nine. I don't  like mayo on my burggers either.,1376179200,,119,3.576923076923077

2865264,3,B000RETOH4,"While ""The Whole 9 Yards"" is a delighteful movie that is fun to watch and deserves 5 stars...Willis, Perry and Duncan play off each other very well and Natasha Hentsridge is a doll, without a doubt ""The Whole 10 Yards"" has got to be the worst sequel ever made and doesn't even deserve 1 star!! The script is awful and whoever dreamed up forcing the viewers to endure a film of incompetent bad guys should never work in Hollywood again!! An insult to any person watching. For Bruce Will to ""star"" in this movie...well, I guess he needed money for gambling debts or alimony!!",1332633600,,573,4.519230769230769

As for me, Natasha Henstridge is my girl so I wanted to watch this. Both of the movies were actually better than I imagined. AS my title suggested, if you want to relax and laugh your rear end for several hours, this would serve its purpose.  I picked up a used copy for $4 for both movies so that translates into $2 each movie which made this even better....... Enjoy~",1322092800,,481,4.161290322580645

The Whole Ten Yards was a nice surprise and I totally enjoyed it!!  I like situations that are believable and this movie is full of them!! Good to get the movies together like this - an excellent bargain!",1293753600,,340,4.059701492537314

2865271,4,B000RETOH4,"The Whole Nine Yards won't win any Oscars, but it's a reasonably funny film and certainly worth the five dollars I paid for it. The sequel is funny too, but falls into the standard sequel traps and has a pretty nonsensical ending. Anyway, it's nice to have both for completion's sake.

If you like this film, I would recommend Get Shorty and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), both of which I feel are better.",1282089600,,402,4.4324324324324325

8200263,4,B000RETOH4,"The Whole Nine Yards is the movie is which Bruce Willis introduces the character of ""Jimmy the Tulip"" a retired mob hit man who has moved in next door to a mild mannered dentist who is having problems with his wife.  I enjoyed the movie and was anxious to see the sequel: The Whole Ten Yards.  The Whole Ten Yards has most of the same actors/actresses as the original and is positioned as taking place a few years later.  Like most sequel movies----it was not as good as the original.  I don't know if this is because of high expectations based on the original, or if it is just hard to come up with another script that ""works"" for the characters introduced in the original, but most sequel movies tend to disappoint me.  I would give The Whole Nine Yards 5 stars----The Whole Ten Yards 3 stars---and an average of 4 stars for the two pack.",1516838400,,840,4.358974358974359
