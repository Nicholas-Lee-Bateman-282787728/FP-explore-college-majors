8744385,5,B0197ZVYBM,"This film is so well-done with a contemporary/documentary approach.  The story-line is simple, yet profound.  The acting is right-on but it is surpassed by some beautiful profound script and cinematography.  Hopefully it can be reproduced for Region 1 DVD's so that Westerners can appreciate what these talented Europeans have offered.  Kudos to the Actors and Producers!",1468281600,2,371,5.571428571428571

Dario Grandinetti is an extraordinary actor and his portrayal of Pope Francis is incredible.",1460332800,6,326,4.295081967213115
