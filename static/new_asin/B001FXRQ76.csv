3589621,5,B001FXRQ76,"If you've read professor and technology history buff, Rachel Maines and her delightful book, The Technology of Orgasm (see my Amazon review), you'll love this companion documentary.  The book goes deeper than the DVD, of course, but does not include the details of the heart felt and very sad pleasure party spokesperson and local Chamber of Commerce leader, Joanne Webb busted in Texas.  What a sad tale of a mom of three (with a husband, also crushed) a former fifth-grade teacher, whose life was hammered by the The Man in Medieval Texas with the help of the county court in Cleburne, a place one hour from Dallas.  Tell me again, please, that we did not really elect a president from this state.  I'll let you connect the dots between the war on the vulva and over 5,000 war dead in Iraq.

Indeed, the Webbs' lawyer called it the war against the clitorises, a very Texas theme evidently.  Six vibrators and your off to jail.  Yes, a family destroyed by an obscenity charge whose cloud still hangs over Texas.  Owning six guns is not obscene there but six vibrators is.  War indeed.
And if you think all this only happens in Texas, and  only ""a long time ago"", read the 2011 review above by the college professor in Chico, CA.  He showed this DVD in class and was charged with sexual harassment and making students feel uncomfortable.  My.  Let's not make college students uncomfortable!

The history of the vibrator, invented even before the household vacuum cleaner or the toaster, is a tale that unfolds like any other great junior high history lesson.  Only this one's about more fun things than The Civil War.  Like: ""Children: Can everyone  say with me...Vuulvaaa.""

The high point for me in this wonderful DVD documentary on the history of the rediscover of the Big O at the dawn of the 70s has got to be that spot where Betty Dodson says women were so excited during that period with all this self discovery Hitachi's magic wand thing that they had to start grasping them in blissful four hour sessions with a potholder as they were overheating.  Overheating indeed.

A close second among highlights has to go to where Rachel Mains, the main story teller, flips through pages on the history of late 19th century women's stitching and embroidery magazines and stumbles on vibrator ads.  Viola.  History unfolds.  My, my.  Also dear were the reenacted trips to the doctor by the lady with ""womb sickness""; so she could get a genital massage and find relief from her ""hysteria"".

The only flaw in this history lesson here is that for some political reason or just that most the folk are east coast, Joani Blank, founder of Good Vibrations in SF was not interviewed, only her same-time contemporary in the east, Dell Williams, founder of Eve's Garden who was wonderful on camera.  Like the industrial revolution or the printing press, the time was simply right for these liberating electrical tools. Same with the roots of the book and research in 1999, controversial but well received.  The interviews around the history of that iconic NOW symposium on female sexuality were priceless as well.

Rent or stream this DVD.  Start a discussion.  I'm amazed how many young women now nothing about the history of the women's moment in the late 60s early 70s.  What a fun place to start.  Oh, and read a book!  The companion Technology of Orgasm by Mains, the inspiration for this DVD.",1308096000,,3386,4.733333333333333

Yes, a family destroyed by an obscenity charge whose cloud still hangs over the Lone Star State.  Owning six guns is not obscene there but six vibrators is. Still.  (I should be fair. No doubt six brains would get you busted in that vast state as well.) War indeed.

3589623,4,B001FXRQ76,"Excellent documentary.  However, I urge instructors to be
cautious about showing this documentary to younger students.
I showed this documentary to my sophomore-junior college
students and was then accused of sexual harassment for
having created a discomforting environment (both for men
and women).  These are conservative times.  Even a documentary
on this sensitive topic can get one in trouble.

  Incidentally, there is absolutely nothing inflammatory
or inappropriate about this informative history of the
vibrator.  No profanity is used.  No diagrams or anatomical
explanations are given.  No simulated sex is presented.  It
is, all things considered, about as inoffensive  as a documentary
can be on this topic.

  Why only four stars?  I found the interviews visually
disconcerting.  The off-center diagonal frames hurt
my eyes.  Also, I thought Dodson's (Sex for One author)
comment about ""riding the vibrator day and night"" a
bit gratuitous.  Given the sensitive nature of the topic,
I would recommend editing out that particular comment.
No need to give viewers an excuse to put down an otherwise
important contribution to the sex positive literature.

  Incidentally, for a thoroughly entertaining and accurate
Hollywood rendition of this story, see HYSTERIA.",1302912000,2,1272,5.589473684210526
3589624,5,B001FXRQ76,"I saw this film at U of A as a presentation by their Women's Resource Center. It was not only an excellent, educational film, it was fun, entertaining and compassionate. If it was currently available in an individual format, I'd buy it in a heartbeat and show it to every friend who I could get to sit still for it! It was one of the best times I've had learning in a long time!",1259798400,,378,4.121621621621622
3589625,4,B001FXRQ76,"This is an excellent, feminist documentary.  However, almost every woman presented is white and women of color are almost invisible in this work.  Remember the Schoolhouse Rock installment about women getting the right to vote and all the animated women are white?  This is equally homogenous and disappointing.
At one point, the narrator says, ""Middle-class women are forced not to have or speak about sexual desires and feelings.""  It's great that they brought up class, but race is absent.  At that time in history, Black women are stereotyped as lascivious and outside of the elite group of women who could be on a pedestal.  The white feminists interviewed here should know that, but they say nothing of it.
The work includes a white comedienne named Reno.  I like her and I wish her career much success.  However, they could have had Margaret Cho, Mo'Nique, or Margo Gomez laughing about the same women's issues.
In the book ""The Color Purple,"" Shug showed Celie that she has a happy button down there.  This work speaks of white women informing other white women about their downstairs equipment, but you never see women of color addressing this issue.
This is a great documentary.  Don't get me wrong.  However, it borders on what bell hooks termed ""white power feminism.""  In a time when one out of four women in the US is of color, the monochrome presentation of this work is beyond troubling.  It's downright shameful!",1242518400,3,1429,4.8796680497925315
3589626,5,B001FXRQ76,"I saw this film at the Women's Building in San Francisco last year. The film makers were present. This movie is a true work of art: tactful, truthful and very real to my own experiences as a child, teen, young woman, and as an adult in my 30's. I only wish my grandmother had seen this film. I actually just bought it for my grandfather. Who at the age of 81 asked me ""do women have orgasms?"" He watched this film and said. ""I never knew. If I'd only known while your grandmother was alive."" They were married for 42 years before she passed. This film is for everyone. It's not pornographic by any means, and it is a lesson we all need to know or remember. Good bye to that silly pink book that talks about maxi-pads in junior high... not practical or realistic. All women of all ages, but especially the young girls who are just discovering their bodies and sexuality should see this movie. Don't take my word, watch it for yourself. It's an eye opener.",1233187200,,954,4.335195530726257

8303070,5,B001FXRQ76,Love this documentary--I show it to my university students each year. Very oddly edited but the messages and concepts are great for discussion.,1431302400,,143,5.260869565217392

8303072,5,B001FXRQ76,"That was the title of the web article I ran across back in 2008, when the book ""The Technology of Orgasm: 'Hysteria,' The Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction,"" by Rachel Maines first came out and various websites felt obliged to at least pen limited pieces on the subject promoting it.  In less than a decade, most of those articles are now gone, deleted from history unless you know to go find them on the WaybackMachine.

I've attached the original article to my blog here http://ranthonysteele.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-astonishing-history-of-vibrators.html along with a few of my thoughts on the subject of human sexuality and some other references.

The film, while littered with cheap visual gimmicks in places, is actually quite good and decently paced.  If you are at all interested in the subject beyond mere prurience, I recommend you give the film a viewing. You might learn something.

It is worth noting that the Texas law cited in the film is still on the books as of 2015. It is still a felony to possess more than six obscene items (whatever that means, since the law has never been tested) and that they cannot be sold as sexual devices but must be euphemistically disguised with other language.

I found the film very informative and hilarious in places. Well worth the time to watch.",1425600000,,1307,4.972477064220183

8303074,4,B001FXRQ76,I never knew that a woman could be sent to jail for owning too many vibrators!!!  Great documentary full of really great information.,1411344000,,133,4.782608695652174
8303075,2,B001FXRQ76,This was very well made movie and the people that were in it were very knowledgeable.  I guess that I did not read enough about the movie and its contents and I was expecting something different.,1400544000,,195,4.416666666666667
8303076,5,B001FXRQ76,It was very entertaining and informative. I think every woman should watch it. It's all about women and not being ashamed of it.,1399161600,,128,4.608695652173913

8303078,4,B001FXRQ76,"This was a good feminist documentary - but it really only touches on some of the aspects of the book it is based on (The Technology of Orgasm: ""Hysteria,"" the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction).  Reading the book made me realize how limited the scope of the video is.  If you are really interested in an in-depth academic history, read the book as well.  If you just want a bit of fun, or an introduction to the history of the vibrator, the video is great.",1353456000,3,464,4.435294117647059
