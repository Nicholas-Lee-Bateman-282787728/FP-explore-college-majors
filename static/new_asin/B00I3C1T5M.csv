6248136,2,B00I3C1T5M,Very trite plot with no real ending....I would avoid this one,1422057600,,61,4.636363636363637
6248137,4,B00I3C1T5M,I'm not sure what to think about the ending but this was a pretty good movie. JJ Feild is fantastic.,1421452800,2,100,4.05
6248138,5,B00I3C1T5M,"Well, for me, this was a good suspenseful,action pack movie . I was all ears and eyes glued to the TV not mention it was beyond good acting ,beyond low budget. I would watch this again for sure. Though, I did not watch it from Amazon I did indeed watch on Netflix. I simply can't wait for the second part of this movie.",1420761600,,319,4.079365079365079
6248139,5,B00I3C1T5M,"I found this movie very engrossing, very suspenseful.  There's the hit man who strolls through an office late at night when only a few employees remain and pick off people, one by one.  Why exactly he executes his victims, it's not clear until the end...and even then, it's not the most coherent explanation, that is one down side.
The actor who plays the assassin did a good job - very spooky in his expressionless efficiency.  Tom, the young man at the center of the plot is believable in his character who is ethical and hard-working, and is not yet jaded by the less well-meaning people in his profession.  He gets fired early on in the movie (so not a spoiler) and is disappointed and somewhat down, but he has it in perspective, knows he will survive it.

Later, when he returns to the office at night for something, he gets intrigued by suspicious behavior of strangers passing off briefcases and then he has his long, drawn out encounter with the tall killer who wears a nice suit and says very little.  Tom turns out to be awful good at composing himself faced off with such danger, thinks on his feet (mostly) and dodges a lot of bullets.  Almost TOO good for a young paralegal, but...that's the way of movies, yeah?",1418428800,3,1226,4.545454545454546
6248140,2,B00I3C1T5M,"A very big law firm is going after a very large pharmaceutical company. Tom (Max Minghella) is a paralegal working on the case. He is secretly dating Ann (Eloise Mumford) so the story doesn't become too linear or boring. Tom gets fired and on his way out espies an odd suitcase exchange. He follows the man (JJ Feild) to the 34th floor only to secretly watch him engage in sabotage and then a murder. The film is then consumed with a cat and mouse game that takes place on one floor in an office building. If watching two grown men hiding under a cubicle desk makes your top ten list of entertainment, go for it. Tom forced himself into the situation and could have taken the stairs out at any time. I never felt the intensity. For me the office cat and mouse game was boring and ""the twist"" was nothing to write home about.

F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",1400284800,,852,4.325
6248141,4,B00I3C1T5M,"It's rare now for a movie to begin by immediately catching your attention.  This movie does!  It wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  I'm not sure why, but I went in to it thinking it was more of a horror/thriller, but it was mainly just a suspense/drama.  I my opinion, at least?  I recognized the main character, Tom (Max Minghella) from his work as Divya Narendra on The Social Network.  I think this guy should get more recognition.

Tom is an office worker for a massive law firm that is going to trial over a Pharmaceutical Company and their product that has the potential to harm millions.  When he discovers some cracks in the case, he puts together a memo to show the bosses.  They fire him for over stepping his boundaries in the company.  But as he leaves the building, he notices an unusual situation taking place.  He decides to head back to the offices where he discovers a killer on the loose.  As he attempts to save the workers left in the building, he begins to uncover information the firm has been hiding.

Pretty entertaining film, actually.  It went by really fast.  There was no dead spots, it was pretty much a fast paced journey from start to finish.

Final Verdict:  WATCH IT!  It's totally worth the time!

8638595,4,B00I3C1T5M,"This is a thriller with a simple setup: Good Guys trapped in an office building with Bad Guys. Its a challenge to keep a premise that is confined to one location fresh and engaging, but the filmmakers pulled it off here. Max Minghella is very likable in the lead role as Tom, a guy whos sort of down and out (lost his job) yet sort of up and at em (he has a new love). In other words, hes not a stereotypical character, but just a real guy. The filmmakers manage to throw in enough twists and turns with the characters and with Tom using his wits to outsmart the bad guys that the film moves quickly enough that you forget you're inside an office building the entire time. Mostly suspense with a little bit of action and good performances.",1523577600,,739,4.285714285714286
8638596,5,B00I3C1T5M,The reviews are messed up.  It's showing reviews for some sick movie.  This is for Brit series NSFW.  It's rly the best. Best thing I've seen so far. Helped. Thank you. Where's series 2?,1519862400,,186,4.411764705882353
8638597,4,B00I3C1T5M,"This show gets much better with each season.  In the beginning it wasn't something I would normally watch (a generational issue, I'm sure).  But I am glad I stuck with it.  It's interesting, even sweet and sensitive at times, and the character development is great.  You start to want to know what happens to each of them in spite of the fact that they are initially very unlikable.",1519344000,,382,4.573529411764706
8638598,2,B00I3C1T5M,"the acting was mediocre at best. i knew from the beginning that the main attorney was involved with hiring the killer. jj looked cool, but not intense enough. the ending is boring.",1515715200,,180,4.65625
8638599,5,B00I3C1T5M,"Clearly no one was paying attention when they wrote their reviews... thinking it was about the movie, not the UK  TV show... alas, I'll watch anything with Zawe Ashton... the perfect amount of beauty, funny, and snarky/quirky/smartassedness.  Great show...and NOT about a law firm. :)",1513382400,,284,5.288888888888889

8638601,4,B00I3C1T5M,I saw this on netflix and was a really good movie- tense thriller--was hoping for a sequel -- based on the ending,1482969600,,113,4.181818181818182
8638602,5,B00I3C1T5M,Very good movie. No slow parts. JJ Feild played a great bad guy.,1468627200,,64,4.0
8638603,4,B00I3C1T5M,"Good movie. One of the main characters, Christian Clemensen, was my neighbor when I grew up.  We're both from Humboldt, Iowa.  It was obvious he was a genius, even at a young age.  He could have been anything he wanted to be.  I figured he'd be a doctor, but he always like acting.  Great guy, I wish we would have stayed in touch.",1444867200,,331,4.190476190476191
