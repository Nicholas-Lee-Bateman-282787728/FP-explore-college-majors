8244332,5,B00126ZX3K,"When I first saw this film on its initial release I didn't know what to make of it. It seemed like it got its inspiration from GOLDFINGER and Ian Fleming's Bond novel MOONRAKER. However, it was like a jumble of everything thrown up in the air and played out in the order in which they landed. Actions just seem to turn on a dime in this film. For example: Bond is being chased down an ice-covered slope by Soviet troops in Siberia all to an exciting John Barry score. This is an excellent scene. A gattling gun mounted on a Soviet helicopter blows the ski mobile right out from under Bond. He picks himself up, grabs the runner from the ski mobile and begins to ski board down the slope this time to the musical accompaniment of the Beach Boys' ""California Girls."" What happened to John Barry's score? The scene and all its dramatic tension are destroyed, yet it seems to work much better today, 28 years latter.

The film looked a bit sloppy. The stunt doubles are not always matched to Roger Moore very professionally. His hair colour seems to go from brown to straw to red. In one scene when Bond is chasing May Day through Paris in a borrowed taxi, there is one camera shot where you can see that it is definitely not Roger Moore. The fight scene where Bond and Sir Godfrey wrap up some of Zorin's guards in the warehouse has to rank at the bottom of the series. The editing couldn't even salvage it.

However, your heart kind of went out for Roger in this one. He didn't have a good outing in this picture and it being his last Bond film, he perhaps deserved better. There were a few memorable scenes that do make this film a good one. After Bond is chased into the woods on horseback and is captured, Bond tells Zorin that there will be retaliation if they kill him. ""You amuse me Mister Bond,"" says Zorin with indifference. ""The feeling's not mutual,"" responds Bond. After that scene I was hoping that Bond would really put this fellow out of his misery. The one image that remains with me from this film is when Bond carries Stacey on his back climbing down the fire truck ladder rescuing her from the burning City Hall. As corny as that scene may have looked it hearkened back to a time in films when heroes really were heroes. Roger did a fine job during his tenure.

After Bonds have come and gone through the years A VIEW TO A KILL somehow still entertains more with each passing year.",1358121600,,2397,4.382022471910112
