8252902,3,B0013TSRCA,Great doc with insights from Syd Mead. Poor audio though.,1422748800,,57,4.8
8252903,5,B0013TSRCA,"Excellent!
Syd Mead is THE best technical and industrial illustrator! Period.
Visual Futurist title really fits him and his drawing and illustrative style.
Another MUST HAVE for the Syd Mead connoisseur!!!",1404691200,,205,5.645161290322581
8252904,3,B0013TSRCA,"It seems like this was done on a very low budget and was a little disappointing, I agree with Roscoe's review that it could have been a lot better.",1398816000,,147,4.103448275862069
8252905,5,B0013TSRCA,"I have been a fan of Syd's work for many years. I have several of his large format (and expensive) books. This DVD gave me an insight into his background and methods that really added to my love of his work.
I would recommend this for anyone interested in future design or the creative process. To paraphrase the head of the Disney Imagineers statement in the DVD, when they run out of ideas they pull out the Syd Mead books for a jumpstart.
The most personal thing I liked about this DVD was Syd's personal history and stories. This tells you a lot about how someone with great talent can follow and create his own path to true success. I was amazed to find out how many movies he has been involved in. I knew about his involvement in Bladerunner, but the large number of other movies, and the interviews with the producers, directors, and designers of those movies, gave me a whole new respect for Syd's work.",1379376000,3,911,4.428571428571429
8252906,3,B0013TSRCA,"If you've seen Gnomon series Techniques of Syd Mead (which is overly long) you'll know what to expect. Basically this is a big back slapping exercise - while I do think Mead deserves recognition and some of the contributions are insightful but I would have preferred a rounded production rather than a gabfest intercut with Meads work. Apart from driving around in his vintage Mercedes, it seems that Mead didn't make much of an effort for what was meant to be a retrospective / bio doc of HIS LIFE.. I think there's potential here to expand on what's been put on film but if this is to be the defining artefact it's disappointing.

My biggest single gripe is shot at 4:3 rather than widescreen so pan-out shots fail to show Meads breathtaking panaromas to their fullest (also while I recognise BluRay/HD would probably have been too expensive some included digital files/screensavers at a higher resolution would have been nice - seeing as the DVD isn't exactly cheap at $32.00 - also the included 'artwork' is a rather pathetic slip on paper not a poster - the packaging is cheap and cheerless).

It's interesting to hear about Meads backstory but he's fairly guarded and quite mercurial - he swings between arrogance and being humble - he certainly knows how to charge and if this is the one lesson you take from the DVD then it's worthwhile. As for what he says - you've heard it all before he has pat interview answers - ""I paint a photograph of something that isn't real"" ""I was always interested in scenario"" - the interview is very deferential and nothing Mead says is challenged or questioned.

Maybe I'm being harsh it's just that I happened to watch Dangerous Days (the making of Blade Runner) recently and I thought it was a shame that Mead couldn't have pulled on his contacts in the movie business to allow him to use footage or still shots - it's a pity Ridley Scott couldn't have given a short interview - it would have been great to see them drawing together as they apparently did during Blade Runner.

Lastly it would have be great to show a little snippets (not in the same detail as Gnomon) of Mead's work methodology rather than him racing around in his car or the rather lame cartoons/computer experiments. I understand the man a little bit better but not his artwork, process, worldview (which seems to be commerical rather than humanistic) I also suspect there is a darker side to his pysche - why and what he draws - it seems to have a lot of POWER and position and what is less clear is whether it's a democratic or priviledged future he wants to envision...

Is it worth seeing? probably - Is it worth $32? probably not",1371686400,5,2647,4.587737843551797
8252907,5,B0013TSRCA,"Awesome book.
Came in perfect condition and was on time.
You will love this edition and all the awesome work by Mead, it is very unique.",1367366400,,136,4.269230769230769
8252908,5,B0013TSRCA,"Definitely a MUST buy for anyone interested in Syd Meads Career, it also includes a little dvd sized poster of one of his artworks which was a nice touch. I would of liked to of seen a more of the behind the scenes of some of his projects such as Blade runner, but all in all if you after a Documentary about Syd Mead that is what you will get and a nice montage type review of his concept art.",1344643200,,394,3.9375
8252909,5,B0013TSRCA,"A must for any Syd Mead fan !!  I was happy to find that there are currently some paparback compilations of Syd's work... and affordable.  In the past, it seems any publications of his work went for $200-300 each.",1296345600,2,213,4.435897435897436
