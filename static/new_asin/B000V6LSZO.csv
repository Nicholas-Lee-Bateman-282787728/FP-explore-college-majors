8216674,4,B000V6LSZO,"What an exciting film. The characters of Okatsu and Rui duplicate the kinds of friendships one sees in buddy-buddy yakuza films, and it's great to see women taken just as seriously on their road to gory revenge. Sure it's sexy and exploitative, and yet it's also a serious good action flick, and it's Junko Miyazono in her glory days.",1387843200,2,334,4.677966101694915
8216675,5,B000V6LSZO,"The second film in the Poisonous Seductress series has little in common with the first, except for its star, the lovely Junko Miyazono, and its writer, Koji Takada.  The theme of a woman exacting revenge against heinous forces of evil is still here, but Miyazono plays a completely different character this time around.  This sort of anthology series is unheard of in the west, and I've had a little bit of trouble wrapping my mind around the concept.  My first experience with this kind of marketing (and that's really all it was) was the Shinobi No Mono series wherein Raizo Ichikawa played various ninja across the course of the series.  The poisonous seductress series only spans three films, but in each one Miyazono plays a different character.  Never mind that the second and third films have protagonists with the same name!  WHAT?  Never mind.  I'm reviewing these as separate features, not as parts of a trilogy.

Quick-Draw is about a woman who was adopted by a widower who runs a local dojo.  Her ""brother"" Rintaro sucks at swordplay and only wants to run off with his girlfriend, a fact which embarrasses her father.  She's an ace with a blade but since she's a woman, her skills aren't as important to the family's pride as Rintaro's.

A local magistrate has his evil eyes set on Okatsu and he goes about getting her through any means necessary.  Rintaro is framed for a crime he didn't commit, Okatsu is raped, and her father is tortured and killed.  When she finally gets free, Okatsu, with the help of Rui, the cutest ninja girl you'll ever see, slashes her way to vengeance!

Okay, there's quite a bit of hyperbole there, but you get the idea.  This movie is a hell of a lot of fun!  It has beautiful women, good fights, and top notch performances.  While the screenplay certainly isn't unique, it gets high marks for keeping the story on the fast track.  You'll find no fat here.  Director Nobuo Nakagawa keeps most of his crazy tricks in the bag where they belong and delivers a tautly paced actioner that would please most any viewer.  His one conceit is his use of a two-story brothel set in a long, wide shot.  The action moves in and out of rooms, upstairs and down, without the camera ever moving.  It's an interesting gimmick but I'm glad he kept it to a single sequence.

Junko Miyazono shines as the titular heroine and Reiko Oshida nearly upstages her as the ninja fighter from the wild.  There's also another guest appearance by Tomisaburo Wakayama-this time as a wandering bounty hunter who also showed up in his own film series and TV show called Shokin Kasegi.

Of particular note is the marvelous score by Koichi Kawabe.  He balances a western-style score with Japanese elements in such a way as to never let one overpower the other.  Lots of Japanese composers could learn a thing or two from the success of this score.  The engaging koto duet that's performed on camera is especially good.

I can't explain why this film (and its predecessor) work so well when so many movies made with similar formulas during the same period seem to fall flat when viewed today.  Perhaps its due to the fact that the restrictions placed on filmmakers were loosening up and we finally got to see truly heinous acts from the bad guys.  Perhaps it's the carefully balanced combination of eastern and western elements in a stew that simmers just so.  Or maybe it's the charm of the outstanding cast.  Whatever the reason, this is one jidaigeki film that shouldn't be missed.  Highly recommended.",1378684800,2,3511,4.681372549019608
8216676,4,B000V6LSZO,"It doesn't matter if its east or west cinema,not too many people embrace a female lead character.  This is not a bad film overall.",1371513600,,130,4.416666666666667
8216677,3,B000V6LSZO,"This second offering in the Okatsu series is ok, but only just. It is by no means made as cheaply as some of the other revenge movies of the time, the costumes are good and the cinematography not bad. The story is slow, really slow, and it becomes more and more boring after the death under torture of her father.
Junko Miyazono is a very attractive woman, but her swordplay is just lame, and I mean really poor. If you have to watch this one, take my word: There is definitely no need to sit through the third part of the series, which is pretty awful.",1282694400,,553,4.226415094339623
8216678,3,B000V6LSZO,"I pose that question seriously. There are so many of these films available, and what's worse is that most fall into the catagory of ""Here's more of the same"" that they almost give revenge flix a bad name. There's a tsunami of them to drown in, and this series brings nothing new to the table, though I've only seen two of the three. Adequate, maybe, horrible, no, but run out to add to a collection? Hardly. Once watched, there's precious little left to offer in repeated viewings. Stick with the top shelf of these films from that era - 'Blind Woman's Curse', 'Lady Snowblood' 1 and 2, and 'Bohachi Bushido; Code Of The Forgotten Eight'. And more recently, the excellent 'Azumi' for true kickass enjoyment. I'd rather sit through Quick Draw McGraw before Quick Draw Okatsu...",1275955200,4,776,4.713235294117647
8216679,5,B000V6LSZO,Quick-Draw Okatsu is part two of the Legends Of The Poisonous Seductress trilogy. This film was okay with Okatsu and Rui fighting and killing their way through samurai clans. I am already looking forward to the final chapter of this series.,1235692800,,240,4.878048780487805
8216680,4,B000V6LSZO,"Second in series entry has great/fun with second banana teen slasher providing support for our lead's (perpetual) revenge.  As Chris D points out in the commentary (always very low key but welcomed and insightful) these Legends films are stock plots made viable by fairly astute directing.  This color offering, ""Quick Draw,"" is a good place to start.  It has all the cliches of the genre, yet it's still very watchable.",1195603200,4,420,4.9714285714285715
