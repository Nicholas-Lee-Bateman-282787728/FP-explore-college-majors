I don't know which features does have the DVD version, but in  laser disc was extraordinary, I learned a lot from the best  cinematographers, e.g. Almendros say that a cinematographer should never  use a fog filter. I really recomend strongly this DVD not only for film  students, but also for every person who own a DVD, you'll never see this on  TV.

536161,3,6303029183,"After reading the glowing reviews, I purchased this item and was looking forward to viewing something on the level of Kevin Brownlow's ""Hollywood"" series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-A-Celebration-of-the-American-Silent-Film-Complete-Set-1-13-VHS/dp/6302597609/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film, Complete Set 1-13 [VHS</a>] except focussing on cinematography.

Instead, what I got was a rambling, somewhat coherent look at cinematographers.  A slight distinction but a necessary one.  (Imagine buying a series you think is on ""history"" then finding out it's about historians instead.)

Instead of focussing on the art of the cameraman, it looks at the cameramen themselves.  Cinematographers sit around talking about ""Connie Hall Haskell Wexler Gordon Willis blah blah blah"" without any explanation of who they are.  A caption or scroll along the bottom of the screen indicating that Conrad Hall filmed ""Butch Cassidy"" and ""American Beauty"" would have been helpful to casual students of the subject.

The other problem I have with this film is its lack of any kind of structure.  It starts off more-or-less chronologically until it gets to post-WW2, then looks at individual cameramen such as Vittorio Storaro and Vilmos Zsigmond, THEN discusses individual films like ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Chinatown,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" (which you might assume would have been in the Vittorio Storaro chapter).  These are presented semi-chronologically up through the late 1980's, although one of the last films is ""Eraserhead"" from 1977.  There are no chapter headings or obvious breaks; the film just cuts from ""Jaws"" to ""Days of Heaven"" to ""Raging Bull"" without explanation.  (There is a little paper insert inside the disk listing chapters and subjects; otherwise I would have been even more lost.)

It's not necessary to be chronological like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cutting-Edge-The-Magic-of-Movie-Editing/dp/B0009PVZEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cutting Edge - The Magic of Movie Editing</a>.

This is not a film for mere movie lovers.  You really need a little bit of background.  There's very little ""This is what effect I was trying to achieve and this is how I did it.""

I appreciated this DVD more and more as I became more familiar with films. The more of a fan you are of both movies and cinematography, the higher you will rate this documentary. From silent movies to modern-day, the producers on this did a fine job showing examples of films from every decade up to 1990. (It would be fun to see an updated edition of this to include films since 1993)

This video gave me a new appreciation for black-and-white films. Some of the photography was magnificent and many cinematographers think that is the medium in which they could really show off their talents.

Regarding color, this documentary is where I first heard about the fabulously- filmed movie, ""Days Of Heaven"" (1978), which has become one of my all-time favorites. In all, there are about 125 films mentioned, so you may discover some gems you weren't aware of, as I did.

After a while I just felt like I was having example after example thrown at me with no breaks or time to breathe.

 Having living professionals talking about their experiences with some of the legends was a good touch, although I found the huge variation in the sets and lighting of them a bit distracting... maybe mentioning who created them or why they were so different would have helped.

536215,3,6303029183,"Sometimes you want to like a film so much it takes you a while to realize that you're not having nearly the fun you'd anticipated.  Such was the case with VISIONS OF LIGHT, a rather loose and rambling celebration of the art of cinematography.

  The film's strengths - conversations with a number of modern, world class cinematographers.  Beautiful clips from movies from the advent of motion pictures to the 1980s.

  Its weaknesses - no coherent thread or linear narrative tracking the development of the art.  The movie bounces around a bit too much for that, and all that jumping about makes things a little disorienting.

  It's as if VISIONS OF LIGHT wanted to make the case that motion picture photography is important and something to be appreciated in and of itself.  I'm already convinced of that, and was hoping to see a more structured piece investigating the hows and whys of the art.

  For instance, one scene deals with a scene from IN COLD BLOOD, a film on which Conrad Hall was the director of photography.  VISIONS runs a clip from that movie that features Robert Blake in a prison cell, talking to a priest.  It's raining outside the window, and the shadows of the rain plays on the expressionless mask the Blake character wears while talking about his father.  As Hall puts it, the shadow of the rain cries for the Blake character.  The rain was a lucky accident which really adds depth to the character and the movie.

  VISIONS OF LIGHT is filled with such scenes, and the film has an anecdotal allure that makes it enjoyable; if it had gone a little farther behind the camera it may have been remarkable.",1102723200,7,1628,4.654929577464789

536257,5,6303029183,"""Director of photography.  The person in charge of lighting a set and photographing a film.  Also known as 'first cameraman,' 'lighting cameraman,' or 'cinematographer,' he is responsible for transforming the screenwriter's and director's concepts into real visual images.""  From Ephraim Katz's Film Encyclopedia.
This collection of film clips and interviews with various DPs (director of photography) and camera operators such as Allen Daviau, William A. Frakeman, Haskell Wexler, and Nestor Almendros reveals their influences, the period during which they worked, what techniques were evolving, and anecdotes.  Clips from about two hundred or so films are examined.
Yes, as Ernest Dickerson says, cinematography's the way one responds to light.  Initially, there was just a director and cameraman, the director in charge of the actors, the cameraman in charge of everything else.  And the stationary cameras didn't give them much to do, but of course that changed over time with the camera dollies and booms, and later, handheld cameras, made more effective by Steadicams, whose inventors won a special Oscar in 1977 in the technical field.  But camera movement gave the DP greater ability to achieve his visual triumphs.
Other than the Katz quote, DPs were to tell the story visually and to make actors and actresses more handsome and prettier but to enhance special features.  Actresses like Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo required special attention, but boy, did they sparkle!  Dietrich's cheeks were made narrower with the lighting used in Shanghai Express.  And small wonder Harold Rosson made Jean Harlow prettier in Red Dust--he even married her (lucky guy!) after her husband Paul Bern committed suicide.
This takes a chronological history of lighting, from the silent era up to the late 1980's, and puts it in context with the history of film.  For example, the role of cinematography changed with the advent of sound.  According to cinematographer John Bailey, the 1920's were the golden age of cinematography because at the time, the camera was unencumbered by sound and all devices accompanying verbal dialogue storytelling.  And when anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen came to be used, DPs had to find some way to use that extra space on either side, as they did with Lawrence Of Arabia, like the scene of Lawrence, having rescued Qaseem, who is greeted by one of the boys, riding towards him.  And with the gradual independence from the studio system, previous errors such as flaring lenses were deliberately used as new techniques.
My favourite era is the film noir era, which borrowed from the German Expressionism of the 1920's.  Sparse lighting, slashes of light, dark shadows, dense rarified vocabulary of visual information, low angles define the characteristics of such films as The Killers, Out Of The Past, and Touch Of Evil.  It's stark black and wide, hardly any greys.
But other uses of dark or darkly lit techniques were shown with the candlelit sequence in Grapes of Wrath, a clip from Fat City, and the accurate capture of period dramas, where there was no electricity and so thus families relied on light from windows.
As for best uses of technique, the pure visual accident in In Cold Blood, where Robert Blake's character is speaking to the chaplain about his father, and the light reflecting off the pouring rain on the window shone on Blake's face, making it look as if he were crying.
This collaboration between the American Film Institute and Japan's NHK Television is ideally for film students/buffs and for moviegoers of a more intelligent and inquisitive calibre, which I hope will comprise of enough people.",1070668800,32,3645,5.173469387755102

I think I missed quite a bit on this DVD and could have viewed it more closely. When you're studying, not working in an industry, and have the volume of material I was finding to go through it is sometimes hard to choose what will be the most useful to a beginner. Conrad Hall's work has always fascinated me, however little I know of it.",1426291200,,641,4.378151260504202

7834842,5,6303029183,"If you've never seen this documentary, treat yourself.  Its appeal is wonderfully broad, meaning it will make as much sense and have as much value to a noob cinephile as it will to a working filmmaker.  Thoughtfully made, using interviews with top-drawer cinematographers, some of whom are regrettably no longer with us, and a very pleasing interplay of remarkable shots intercut with a discussion of that very shot or technique.  Find yourself a copy and tuck it away in your library.",1410307200,,485,4.962962962962963

7834844,4,6303029183,"My boyfriend always appreciates the cinematography of movies, so I decided to do some research and look for a documentary about it. I found this, and it seemed to always be rated or voted the best cinematography documentary.  I took a chance and bought it, and he told me he really loved it, that he watched it twice in a row.  I haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but my goal was that he would really love it, and that goal was definitely accomplished.  The bad reviews I'd read before buying were always about the fact that I guess interviews with the different people on screen were to short, or would cut away too quickly, but then again other reviews said they LIKED that about the film, so I guess it's just everybody's different opinion.",1325980800,,747,4.437956204379562
