7969454,1,B00006IUG5,"I made a stupid mistake and bought this thinking it was the comedy movie ""Student Bodies"" with some extras. I don't know what I was thinking. At any rate, I had no interest in what I received at all. It appears to be some very old ""teaser"" movies. Quality was poor, but perhaps the original media was not high quality to begin with. The only value in this for me was seeing the very early work of some of today's superstars. Other than that, it will probably just end up in the trash for me. Others might find these old movies interesting, though.",1168300800,5,547,4.320388349514563
7969455,4,B00006IUG5,"This DVD set has almost no extra features (Play and Scene Access only), and seems like they took bad prints of four old movies and simply dumped them onto DVD.  There's dust on the frames plus occasional minor film rips, dropped frames and warped sound.
So why 4 stars?  The quality is good enough to watch the movies without significant distraction, and the lack of reproduction quality actually kind of adds to the ""feel"" of watching old campy movies.  And most importantly, [money](the price when this was written) for 4 movies on DVD is an absolute [bargain].
Important point:  ""The Harrad Experiment"" included in this set is the full uncensored original version (Rated R, 97 minutes), not the 'edited for TV' version which is all that's available on standalone DVD and VHS today.
There are also a number of well-known actors in these movies, often in roles before they became famous.
Included on this 2 DVD set (each movie is on one side of a DVD):
""Seniors"" (1978) with Dennis Quaid and Priscilla Barnes. Four students open a bogus sex clinic for cheap thrills and then are amazed to see it blossom into a profitable business
""Getting Wasted"" (1980) with David Caruso. Cadets at a military academy get involved with the 60's drug culture.
""Secrets of Sweet Sixteen"" (AKA ""Sweet 16"" - 1981) with Bo Hopkins, Patrick McNee and Larry Storch. Why are all the boys dying to meet Melissa?
""The Harrad Experiment"" (1973) with James Whitmore, Tippy Hedren, Bruno Kirby, Don Johnson (plus if you look, you can find Melanie Griffith, Gregory Harrison, and Fred Willard). At the coed Harrad College the students experience a college policy of sexual freedom.",1035763200,28,1653,4.871886120996441
