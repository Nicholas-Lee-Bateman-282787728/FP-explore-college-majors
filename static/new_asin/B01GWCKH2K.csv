7769512,5,B01GWCKH2K,Well presented. The moves flowed. After comparing it against another course focused on the same issues. I found Lee Holden's presented better and will use it as the one I choose to practice routinely.,1483747200,,200,4.911764705882353
7769513,4,B01GWCKH2K,Good exercises. Just want more at that price. Wish it included his YouTube neck exercise.  I've edited my first review now that I've used the DVD for a few weeks.  I thoroughly enjoy it and find it helping my chronic head/neck issues.,1440892800,2,234,4.5476190476190474

7769516,5,B01GWCKH2K,"I am totally happy with this DVD.  I have compression fractures in my back, and thought Qi Gong for Upper Back and Neck might give me some relief from the nagging pain.  I feel Lee Holden's DVD has been very helpful.  I have noticed I can stay active longer than before.  I will continue to use this DVD and hope for even more relief.  Thanks, Lee Holden, for your dedication to health and people's well being.",1394582400,8,410,4.342105263157895
7769547,5,B01GWCKH2K,"There are many workouts to be found for the lower back, but the upper back and neck are an often neglected area of the body. Thats why Lee Holdens new DVD is such a relief, literally.

This DVD, filmed in beautiful Yosemite National Park, features a long 40+ minute routine as well as a brief 20 minute version for those who are pressed for time. The stretches and movements are simple to perform and Mr. Holdens informative instruction makes it easy to follow. This type of exercise is a great way of relieving tension in the back, neck, and upper body and alleviating the pain that usually follows. Those who spend much time hunched over a keyboard or a screen will benefit from releasing the stress of those unnatural positions. Small repetitive movements can also lead to poor posture and pain, so the large, broad motions of Qi Gong are a beneficial corrective action.

I was looking forward to this DVD since Ive had some recent headache and neck pain issues. I just finished a couple weeks of physical therapy, and I found nothing in this DVD that would contradict any of the PT stretches I learned. In fact, I will be adding much of Mr. Holdens Qi Gong for the Upper Back and Neck routine to my morning regimen.

I received a copy of this DVD in exchange for a fair and honest review.",1510012800,,1292,4.48936170212766
7769548,5,B01GWCKH2K,"Lee Holden follows his fine Introduction to Qi Gong with this 45 minute emphasis on using Qi Gong to heal and prevent upper back and neck injuries. It is estimated that 80% of people will have an upper back or neck injury at some time so it makes sense to have a set of strategies to follow.
Holdens calming style and gentle workouts are the right prescription for those of us who suffer. He demonstrates basic stretches and exercises to compensate for habitual movements, muscular tension and repetitive motion injuries by emphasizing deep breathing, gentle movements, and a calm state of mind. This DVD would make a great gift for anyone who struggles to navigate the stresses of modern life.",1508284800,2,694,4.791666666666667
7769549,4,B01GWCKH2K,"I am a yoga and martial arts practitioner and while I am familiar with Lee's work via his DVD ads, this is the first I've actually done. Like many, I struggle with neck and shoulder pain regularly and appreciate qigong moves intended to target these specific areas.  The DVD itself is incredibly easy to follow with an introduction that can be skipped by anyone familiar with any basic qigong.  There is a long and a short routine, depending on how much time one has available. The previews section can be skipped as well (he has DVDs for just about anything).  Lee avoids getting into a lot of the esoteric language sometimes associated with qigong and most of the moves have been adapted to specifically loosen areas most commonly blocked and/or stressed. The pleasant music and gorgeous setting of Yosemite will keep me coming back to this routine in the future. These routines are great for beginners, but can certainly be used by more experienced as anyone can benefit from loosening the shoulders and neck. These moves can be built upon to create even more of a release and openness in the upper body.",1508198400,3,1107,4.725388601036269
7769550,5,B01GWCKH2K,"Mr. Holden presents a well thought out, easy to follow series of Qigong exercises targeting a very sensitive and important area of the body.  Our modern society has created so many opportunities for repetitive motion injuries and other pathologies due to chronic bad positioning and posture.  Most people, myself included, at one time or another suffer from headaches, neck aches, shoulder pain, arm pain etc. that is attributable to stiffness and swelling of the neck and shoulder area.  This set of Qigong exercises works to release the built up tension in the neck and shoulders.  It also helps to increase the circulation in these areas.  In my experience, done consistently over time, this set relieves chronic pain in the neck and shoulders and helps to maintain flexibility and circulation even during those hours of work that caused the problem in the first place.

There is both a short (20 minute) and long (40 minute) set presented on this DVD so it is easy to fit into most anyones schedule.  I believe everyone could benefit from this set of Qigong in either treating or preventing chronic neck and shoulder issues.",1508112000,2,1128,4.936507936507937
7769551,5,B01GWCKH2K,"The material presented in this video will be welcome by anyone who needs relief for neck and back problems caused by stress, hard day at work or other causes.  Of course, severe back and neck problems should be looked at by a physician.  This is also a good relaxing workout after a strenuous martial arts class, various sports or just to relax.  The video is clearly presented and easy to follow by people of all ages.",1507939200,,419,4.4868421052631575
7769552,5,B01GWCKH2K,"After viewing Mr. Holden's intro to Qi Gong, I was fortunate to receive and view this dvd as well.  Please see my other review for info on that presentation.

The upper back and neck dvd is a more specific series than the original introductory one.  The ""foundation"" exercises are similar, but new concepts are introduced making this an effective presentation for a targeted audience.

Again, Mr. Holden's approach to presenting the concepts and exercises was well delivered, easy to follow and the more I watch the dvd the more appreciative I am of Dr. Yang's efforts to showcase talented individuals in both the martial and healing arts of the East.

Mr. Holden should be congratulated on a job well done.  I look forward to other of his offerings with anticipation",1506643200,,767,4.861538461538461
7769553,4,B01GWCKH2K,"Qigong for Upper Back and Neck is a nice routine, especially if, like me, you spend 10 or so hours a day working in front of a computer. I was a bit hesitant since this is a YMAA product not featuring Dr. Yang, but it seems YMAA is branching out like Gaia and other fitness publishers. Lee Holden is a pleasant enough presenter and the routine is simple and easy to follow, so this would be a good entry level DVD for people interested in qigong.
My one critical comment would be that there is a lack of background information on qigong, which, if you are familiar with Dr. Yang's work, is a bit disappointing. For example, the Sunrise Tai Chi program has so much information in it you can watch the video for months and still learn new material. In general, YMMA products tend to be exhaustively thorough.
In this case, Qigong for Upper Back and Neck, you don't have as much background information, but if you are a newbie and this DVD interests you in qigong then there are a lot of YMAA DVDs you can use to further your education.
The video is filmed in Yosemite Valley and the background scenery is awesome.",1506211200,2,1111,4.398058252427185
7769554,5,B01GWCKH2K,"From a Holistic point of view, this is the most neglected part of our bodies.  Yet for optimum overall health we really need to address the Neck and upper back.  How?  Seriously, how?

I am an intermediate yoga practitioner (I do not expect to advance beyond that I am served well by my skill level), but none of the routines I practice have ever freed up the seemingly-permanent-state of tension and constricted flow of energy which exist in the upper part of our torsos, mine and no doubt yours as well.  This video does just that.  And it does so from the first application.

Me:  55 years old.  I drive for the worlds largest express delivery company.  I work 11-14 hour days (which explains why I tend to neglect the very disciplines, like Qui Gong, that would make my day and overall health so very much better).  I have twice in my life had the opportunity to study with distinguished Qi Gong Masters.  I know what the practice can do for the human body.  I just keep falling away from the practice.

It does not matter if you drive a vehicle, load ships, operate on patients in a hospital or sit in a cubicle for a living  Just like with me, that tension builds and builds and builds daily.  We carry it in our faces, our level of energy and our general demeanor.  We all feel it, we consent to it like background noise and none of us expects or accepts that there is any other way to live our daily lives.

WELL NO MORE!

Prior to this video I had never heard of Lee Holden.  I gotta tell you, he is a true teacher/practitioner.  The exercises offered in this video are easy to learn. Well instructed and MAN, DO THEY DO THE JOB!  In just a few moments I felt the constraints of the tension being lifted removed like blockage in a main artery.  I felt fibers in every muscle releasing.  I could feel the meridians opening and the energy flow again!  At one point the term deep tissue massage popped into my head; at the very same moment Lee used the term Deep Tissue massage to describe the effect he expected me, the practitioner, to be feeling.  He was dead on!

There was a feeling of very positive energy flowing through my upper body the rest of the day.

This is an area ignored by me for far too long.  That has  now Changed!",1505520000,2,2241,4.3173076923076925
7769555,4,B01GWCKH2K,"Another decent DVD by Mr Holden. There is always something to learn.
You should not be disappointed if your moving along with this one.
You can and will release tension in this vital area of the body.
Take a moment!",1505433600,,215,4.4
7769556,4,B01GWCKH2K,"Easy to follow, clear instructions and demonstrations.

Quite useful, as well.  A few weeks of regular (not even everyday) practice is easing my neck/upper back pain.  My job requires occasional long car trips and I can do these without discomfort or pain afterwards.

I do more general qigong exercises (flying phoenix and taiji ball).  These exercises are specific to the target area and give quicker results for neck/upper back issues, in my experience.

My only caveat is do not overdo and consult your health care professional about this.  If you've had neck problems, the last thing you want to do is to screw up your again.

I recommend you give this a go.",1501459200,,663,4.8053097345132745

8763972,5,B01GWCKH2K,"Wow!  I have had constant pain in my neck for years.  I have tried numerous remedies such as the plastic neck massagers, numerous  topical pain relievers, books on neck pain, etc, etc.  I didn't know what to expect with this DVD  but I was amazingly surprised.  After doing this video just once I got immense relief!.  Prior to this DVD I was constantly aware of the neck pain on my right side.  Since using the DVD I am not aware of pain until I repeat the exercises the next day and stretch out the tensed up muscles again.  I have only used this video about six or so times.  I plan to use it daily (short version) until I get all the kinks out.  Then I am assuming I can use it less frequently after I get more stretch to the muscles.  I also got his DVD for Energy and Vitality and am also using it daily.  For some unknown reason I have a lot of stress i.e. tensed up muscles so I plan to use the Energy one every day (short version) indefinitely.  I am so glad I came across these DVD's on Amazon.",1528761600,,1004,4.082051282051282
8763973,2,B01GWCKH2K,"I liked the old one much better! I also like the old versions of Qigong for Seniors(great for fibromyalgia!) and others that offer a ""music only"" option. Too much instructions on new versions.",1524182400,3,192,4.848484848484849
8763974,5,B01GWCKH2K,Gentle movements presented in a way that made it easy for me to follow along. I love that it was recorded in such a beautiful setting. Just looking at that incredible scenery helped me relax and flow with the movements.,1523318400,,219,4.5
8763975,5,B01GWCKH2K,"I most highly recommend this program. As someone that unfortunately experienced whiplash from getting hit by a drunk driver, I can personally attest to the effectiveness of this Qigong routine. It is also nice to have the beautiful setting of Yosemite Valley complementing the beatiful Qigong movements.",1518307200,,303,5.468085106382978

8763977,5,B01GWCKH2K,"This video is a step by step, follow along, way to loosen up the tight muscles we all have in our upper back and neck.  His instruction is clear, easy to follow and very effective in relaxing those tight muscles.  He has both a long and short version of the exercises.  I would recommend doing the long version along with him at first and then use the short version to keep those muscles loose.  I have studied Qigong for 5 years and was familiar with many of the movements, but Lee has put them together in a very effective way.  He explained and demonstrates the movements as well as teaching the breathing that goes with the movements. I was surprised at some of the tension I found as I followed his exercises and stretches. I will definitely be using this regularly.",1515369600,,771,4.439716312056738
8763978,5,B01GWCKH2K,"Lee Holden's whole approach is low-key, peaceful and calming.  And what he demonstrates works.",1514246400,,94,5.714285714285714
8763979,4,B01GWCKH2K,"I really appreciate a practice that focuses on this area of the body as I carry most of my tension in my neck and shoulders. I could definitely feel the tension being released during this practice. I also really enjoyed that this DVD offers a short and long routine. Whether I have more or less time to spend with this, I can still get a practice in.",1512518400,,350,4.2388059701492535
8763980,5,B01GWCKH2K,"This DVD is just what I needed.  I am a pianist that spends several hours a day practicing, which easily leads to upper back and neck tension.  I also had an accident several years ago resulting in a fractured vertebra in T5. Muscle memory has continued to hold tension in that area - muscles trying to still protect a former injury even though it is now healed.  After just a few sessions with this DVD, I'm already experiencing less pain and more freedom in my upper back.  I'm convinced that using this DVD will retrain my muscles to be relaxed and pain-free.",1511049600,2,562,4.480392156862745
