4160031,5,B003NLE5N6,"This is a charming little film! ""The Waiting Room"" from 2007 and written and directed by Roger Goldby, is just the kind of film rarely seen today. This is the story of 'Anna' (Anne-Marie Duff ""The Magdalene Sisters"" 2002) and 'Stephen' (Ralf Little). Both of whom, after a chance meeting in a train station waiting-room (when 'Anna' came to the aid of one of 'Stephen's' nursing-home residents 'Roger' Frank Finlay) were instantly drawn to each other (they barely spoke, but it was apparent). You see, 'Anna' is a single-mother, and 'Stephen' lives with his girlfriend who is pressuring him about having a baby. 'Roger' serves as the unassuming/unknowing go-between that will bring these two lost and love-struck souls together. I'd rather not give the whole story away, suffice it to say, it's the kind of film that many of us can relate to (very true to life). The entire cast was wonderful: Anne-Marie Duff, Rupert Graves, Frank Finlay, Ralf Little, Zoe Telford, etc., etc. A wonderful romance-drama, with all the wit and charm that only the British seem capable of! A very positive and uplifting film, because, life happens! The DVD picture quality by IFC Independent Film was excellent. NTSC, English (English subtitles), NR 110 mins.

Love and Peace,

4160033,4,B003NLE5N6,"In this era of casual relations, one night stands, quick partnering soon broken by separation, divorce as the standard, single parent homes, and all that seems to have replaced longevity in relationships, it is not surprising that Roger Goldby wrote and directed this little British film that deals with all these aspects - and yet leaves a window for redemption open. The film is well cast, stylishly acted, and while it can be a bit tedious at times (sort of the way life is tedious at times) it still manages to leave room for hope that real love can really happen.

Anna (Anne-Marie Duff) meets Stephen (Ralf Little) at the train station where the elderly Roger (Frank Finlay) is waiting for his wife. Though words don't really happen there is a chemistry that is evident.  But the two part - Anna is divorced from Toby (Adrian Bower) and lives as a single parent with Charlie (Polly Rose McCarthy) and Stephen is living with Fiona (Christine Bottomley) in an emotionally flat line situation: Stephen spends his days working at a nursing home where he relates very strongly with his elderly patient Helen (Phyllida Law). Obviously something is missing in their lives.

Next door to Anna lives a couple - George (Rupert Graves) and Jem (Zoe Telford) with one son Joe (Finlay Kenny Tighe) - and Anna is in a sexual relationship with George despite her friendship with Jem.  George and Jem are not at all happy: George's affair with Anna is the only glue that holds their marriage together.  But Anna obsesses about Stephen (though she doesn't even know his name - his is just `a lovely man') and when George decides to leave Jem for Anna, Anna confesses she does not love George and makes him return to his role as husband and father, and thanks to the love little Joe has for his Dad and family it looks as though that will last. Meanwhile Stephen confesses to Fiona that he doesn't love her (he is obsessing for the mysterious Anna) and in a series of events and changes and fantasies blended with circumstances and needs Anna and Stephen finally meet again at the train station - or do they???

It is that kind of harsh reality accompanied by loving fantasy that draws us into this very intelligent, distinctive film.  The acting is top drawer and the photography and direction make the whole story work. Maybe there is a place of fate or destiny...it is nice to believe in that if only for the duration of a lovely little film.  Grady Harp, August 12",1346284800,2,2456,4.642857142857143
4160034,4,B003NLE5N6,"I'm going to say that the thing I enjoyed the most was the light in this movie, and then the heavy draped, rich colored, in and outs of the rooms-spaces-places (ok I also liked the music that scored all of it). This sort of dragged you through a time of things in lives feeling heavy, colored by the pain of want, messes, as it moved you into the longings, the twists and turns of several scr*wed up relationships. So basically you have two strangers meeting in a train station. They listen to an older man talk of his life, his love, his meanings found with the one he loves, and they make a ""connection."" It changed everything in their unrelated real lives....it was just there now in the minds of these two. That's basically the core of the movie. What goes on after they return to their reality is interesting.
And I suppose the premise of the rest is to ask would that be worth all that they might have to shift and change and have happen for them to find out if this is ""it."" Or perhaps there is an inevitability because they can't live a lie. I'm going to have to think about that. In fact it might well be a modern treatise on the notions of love and ""waiting for something.""

So each person goes back into their lives and we do too, it's painful- actually -to do that. He's (the guy in the chance meeting) this charming nurse to an elderly patients in an nursing home. In a relationship that seems to be missing love, a girl he can't communicate with, a relationship he's unable to fulfill with a girl that is pressuring for children perhaps as a fix for the void. It feels like a train wreck.

She's(the girl in train station) just left a man, has a child, got into some stupid, stupid post break brief affair in her pain with a next door best friend's husband. So that's like a tumor sitting there. All these grabs when the friend leaves the room by the husband. Ugh. You might want to just dismiss it all, run away, but the filming is interesting,  except it is filmed so in and out of the struggle to find a way through this. No one is feeling clean and real. It's distortion, dissatisfaction, struggle. You ask yourself over and over if this angst is worth suffering bad relating. Or for a brief moment I thought, should I do the dishes now?
He tells her he's fallen out of love.( guy in train meeting to his girlfriend). She (girl in train station meeting) tells the friend's husband she's not sheleping around with a married man. And this is also about both of them looking at what they need to be able to all have happier lives. And somehow out of trying to turn it right maybe something starts to break up the mess. Don't worry if you lost track here, who cares.
It's rather interesting to watch, and whoever compared it to Sex and the City is nuts.

It's really about people finding a way trying to do right things, to try to hear their heart, to move lives onward. I could have done without the morning naked b*tt pe*ing shot. It was the ""I'm living alone now"" being a naked guy thing. I could do without that. It didn't set up the finale for me.

 But I did really enjoy the final scenes of the nursing home and the ins and outs of following a few days in their lives. This couple that met in this coincidence are both interestingly made through the directors choices into beings you feel goodness and innately want to support. They have the quality of being able to care. To fumble and make error and yet have in them something that makes him open and read a photo album of a lost patient....it just is utterly a home unlike any facility I know here in America-they care. You warm to this film, these places.

Even Mr. cheat is someone that you are allowed to find goodness in.
Time moves and these two change their lives to be able to find one another again and to make that connection. Chanced in a train station.

I think that a lot of people will like it.  To me it tried too hard, I didn't really relate to the main character and it veered way too far into stereotypes and sentimentalism.  There are many films that do this kind of thing very well but to me this is this just doesn't ring true enough to be as touching as it is supposed to be.",1382140800,,490,4.180851063829787
