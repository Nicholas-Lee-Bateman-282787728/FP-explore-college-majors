It ought to have been up when they put the little training teaser up here, and here it is, the night of the premiere and I still can't give them my money so I can watch it over and over again at my leisure? Don't even get me started on how my friend and I were going to watch this week's SHIELD and found it wasn't up yet.

5864628,5,B00DY64BLG,"This is the most realistic movie that I have seen.  All of the characters fit perfectly .  The cop that is always after Oliver plays his part perfectly.  Oliver and Diggle make an unusual and excellent partnership.
 Olivers family seem to  fit the profile of the problems of the very rich.  They get into all kinds of trouble but their money buys them a way out. That is the way that I see rich political leaders like the Kennedy family, the  Clinton family and all the other leaders.
They want and get money and power but in real life there is not anything to really stop them like the Hood.
This is the type of movie that the world is looking for, a hero.  It is also a movie that gives encouragement that anyone can make a difference in this world.  You don't have to be rich to make a difference.  I am glad that
Oliver puts others first to protect his city even though he is rich, he does not make it a priority.
You and I can make a difference in our life by helping others with what we have.",1379203200,5,998,4.151041666666667
5864629,3,B00DY64BLG,Really good. Has lesbian kissing scenes in it which I really didn't (my personal opinion) appreciate because my kids are hooked on it. It is just hard explaining to a 7 year old why 2 girls are kissing.,1518134400,,202,4.342105263157895
5864630,5,B00DY64BLG,"It was mostly this season in particular which secured my official loyalty as a fan of the show, as this was a particularly intense season, and a definite game changer for everyone, especially Oliver. As a writer, one of my favorite types of characters are the noble heroic types generally typical of superheroes, but what makes Oliver stand out is his superpower is, strangely enough, pain and suffering.

When the show began, Oliver's main reason for taking up the bow and becoming the vigilante was intensely personal, as his father had confessed just before killing himself that his family's wealth had been built on the suffering of others. During the first season, his prime obligation is indeed towards the welfare of the city, but is mainly influenced by his desire to cleanse the sins of his family. By the end of the first season, especially following Tommy's death, his personal connections to that vow fades considerably and transforms into focusing directly on the city. In the second season, we begin to see a transformation in Oliver in which he comes to possess an understanding that what he began as the vigilante is something far bigger than himself.

The completion of this transformation in Oliver occurs in the episode ""City of Blood"", in which Amell has received considerable praise for his deliverance of a very distinct performance. Based both on what he has experienced since returning to Starling City and what he experienced on the island, he comes to possess a better understanding of how one's actions affect others on an intensely personal level. This transformation started with the arrival of Slade Wilson in the city, and ended with Slade's tirade vendetta against Oliver inflicting on him probably the worst suffering he's experienced during the course of the show. By the time this episode occurs, it has been revealed that Slade has suffered greatly because of actions Oliver either took or failed to take. First came Shado's death, with whom Slade was in love with, which occurred when Oliver chose to save Sara instead. More significantly was when the Mirakuru came into usage, as Oliver both administered this to Slade and later failed to cure Slade of its effects when he had the chance, for which Slade suffered immensely.

One of the major stages of Slade's vendetta was recreating the situation in which Shado met her end, in which Slade forced Oliver to chose between the two most important people in his life, who would live and who would die, Moria or Thea. Despite Oliver's best efforts, Moria sacrifices herself for her children, after which, before disappearing into the darkness, Slade tells him that before this vendetta was to end, one more person had to die. Here, the transformation completed. Following Moira's death, Oliver attains an unusual sense of clarity over the situation based on the evidence before him. In seeing how Slade recreated the scenario which led to Shado's death on the island, and how he planned on unleashing the army of Mirakuru-induced soldiers on the city, Oliver accepts this was all in fact result of his actions on the island. At the same time, he's also painfully aware of the fact that at that time, he had no means of defeating Slade or preventing anyone else getting hurt, leaving him with only one card in his hand left to play. Seeing how Slade spared him and Thea after Moira sacrificed herself, he comes to one firm resolution.

Now, several critics, while still praising Amell's very intense performance in this episode, denounced Oliver's following actions as rash, fool hearted, self centered and wallowing in self pity, and that he wasn't thinking clearly. I'm seeing the exact opposite.

When Oliver doesn't show up to Moira's funeral, John and Felicity track him down at an apparent secret backup hideout, where he reveals in striking clarity what he intends to do as a last effort to stop Slade from hurting anybody else, which is to surrender to Slade. He starts by correctly acknowledging his responsibility for Slade's actions, and based on Slade's proclamation that before the vendetta could end, one more person had to die, comes to the conclusion that if he offers himself as that last person and lets Slade kill him, Slade would spare everybody else, and the city.

Oliver's reason for coming to this conclusion is about as far from self-centered as possible, as despite the fact that he's in an overwhelming amount of pain (based on his facial expression and the tone in his voice), he manages to keep his composure, his only concern being to keep those closest to him (Thea, Laurel, Sara, Felicity and John) safe and to spare the city he vowed to protect from destruction at the hands of Slade's army. When Felicity tries to dissuade him from his decision, he makes a reference to something someone else he'd met on the island had told him. When on the island, he and Sara were trapped underwater on a Japanese submarine with a man named Peter. The only way for them to escape is to dislodge the sub using one of the torpedoes, which could only be operated in such a manner manually from the inside, basically a suicide mission. However, Peter tells them that he is already dying from radiation poisoning, conveying the same scenario of their being no other alternative Oliver finds himself in, and offers to free them. Oliver tells Felicity the same words Paul had offered him and Sara, that ""the essence of heroism is to die so that others could live"".

This is what I like to call the perfect example of the makings of ""The Heroic Sacrifice""

First, based on Oliver's conviction of duty stemming from his justifiable sense of responsibility over what happened to Slade, it seems reasonable to assume that this was not a decision Oliver was making on a whim, but was rather more almost as decisive as Slade's efforts to torture him. Second, having seen that Slade was decisive and merciful enough to spare Thea after killing Moira, Oliver had every reason to believe that Slade had enough restraint for him to convince Slade to accept him in exchange for everyone else, making this undoubtedly the bravest thing a person in this kind of situation can do. That transformation of conviction which started with Tommy's death and ended with his mother's death, even in spite of all the pain he'd suffered at the hands of Slade, gave him the strength to stay true to his devotion to those dear to him and even more so to the vow he made to protect the city, even in the face of death. Finally, Oliver had properly analyzed the situation to the point that he concluded the only bargaining chip he had left to use against Slade was his own life. Luckily, Laurel was able to find him another one just in the nick of time by providing solid evidence that her suspicions about Sebastian Blood had been true, that he'd been conspiring with Slade all along. With Laurel renewing his hope that he could still defeat Slade after all, he abandoned his plan to surrender, owing to the logic that the Heroic Sacrifice is only to be used as a last resort. Him not going through with that plan didn't matter, the fact he was willing to go that far when there was no other option proved him capable of true heroism.",1517875200,,7204,4.785369774919614

5864634,2,B00DY64BLG,"I watched this show hoping the entire time that it would get better. I like what they did with the origin. Its kind of a Green Arrow/Batman blend. The story, the characters, and the by episode plot is just terrible. They are shallow and appear stupid no matter how intelligent they are supposed to be, making repeatedly and increasingly idiotic decisions to fuel a garbage plot. This is written for tweens, and for them, it'd be great. Don't go into it expecting a good show for adults.",1511481600,,486,4.597701149425287

Started slowing down about a dozen episodes in, and getting hyper dramatic peyton placey spacey and self-introspective whiny and weird after that....Second Season??? It's like the remake of Battlestar Galactica. It takes 5 shows for anything to happen, and tons of ""psychodrama city"" crap. I guess you'd enjoy it if you were in a psychotic family. When the bad hoodie came back for season two, I was done. It took them 5 episodes too long to kill the bastard in the first place, and, well, no way. Just invent another character! he sucked anyway. Subtract the drama, and this is a show for a wrestler dude who is too sensitive to be a decent vigilante. Wimpy garbage for 12 year old gossipy girls. Ha ha.",1490745600,,746,4.702290076335878
5864673,5,B00DY64BLG,"I put off watching this show for years. Finally gave in a month ago. This is seriously the best show I have watched since LOST. Stephen Amell is superb. The talent of the cast is beyond anything I have seen in a TV series. I am not a huge DC fan so I had zero knowledge of The Green Arrow before this. I have been a Marvel fan and this blows all the Marvel movies out of the water based on character development. If you let go of preconceived notions or prior knowledge of the comic you will LOVE this show. I wish I would have started the series in 2012 when it first debuted. I am now caught up to season 5. Have watched seasons 1-4 2x and am going back and watching my favorites, AGAIN. I do not watch much TV but this has me hooked. Seasons 1-3 are amazing. 4 is just ok but neccesary for character development in my opinion. Just stick with it because season 5 is kicking bootie again and taking names!!! I bought all 4 seasons because if netflix ever stops streaming it I cannot even imagine being with out the ability to watch. Best Show Ever!!!

5864676,1,B00DY64BLG,"I watched this on Netflix, all of season 1, and about half or season 2.  Season 1 is pretty good.  But in season 2, most of the episodes are small parts of a larger story that leave you hanging over and over again.  They changed it into a soap opera where things are almost never resolved at the end of the episode.  I got disgusted and quit watching.  I have a degree in science, and they almost completely lost their credibility on the second season, repeatedly presenting events that are implausible or impossible.  I am willing to put up with some stretching, since we clearly don't have a complete understanding.  I enjoyed Star Wars, Star Trek, Batman, The Avengers, and Iron Man, to name a few.  But this one is not worth the time.",1489536000,,738,4.455223880597015

My only complaint is that shows like this aren't available as part of Amazon Prime.  I just love Amazon.  Before Amazon, everything I needed would have been a trip to a different store.  Now, if I need something  just about anything, I go and look at Amazon first. Its amazing that I can buy everything from  Its amazing that I can buy everything from cereal, dog food, nail products, clothing, household items and electronics.  Along those lines, buying this video is just another example of the wonder that is Amazon.  I have been very impressed with the huuuge selection on Amazon.  I don't think there is anything that you cant buy on Amazon, short of perishable foods.  Most of the time you can the items cheaper than you can in the local store, but not always. Then we have the additional spectacular invention that is Amazon prime.  This praise and rant doesnt mean that I think Amazon is perfect, and I have had a few problems here and there, but over all  Amazon is my go to place for everything I need to buy, except groceries.

5864872,5,B00DY64BLG,"The first season started off fairly slow before getting awesome. This season instead starts off great and, hopefully, will continue to be even greater.

The episode explains how the results of the ""earthquake"" and Tommy's death have on Oliver's esteem in becoming 'The Hood' again.

The laughs are still there but it seems that the show itself is going to be more darker. Oliver doesn't want to be a vigilante and the season is particularly going to focus on Oliver becoming a 'Hero' rather then being known as a murderer.

Perfect start to the season and it feels like a completely different show (which is a good thing). I love Arrow and hopefully it continues to amaze me each week",1461024000,,684,4.683333333333334

5864916,5,B00DY64BLG,"I am old, but I love the Arrow. At a time of a tragic double loss in my life, when I was depressed, and unable to focus on what I needed to be doing, the only thing that made me happy, lifted me up, and took me away from all that was going on around me, was the Arrow. I ran across this show by accident, had never heard of the Arrow before, but I am so glad I found it. I love Stephen Amell and all the characters. In my opinion the casting is perfect, there is never a dull or boring moment, great story, lots of action, normal people dealing with things in their lives, while fighting against the evil, to make things better.  It was hard for me to wait for the next show, so I bought all the shows that are out, and have a pre order in for the next series. I guess you could say I am probably the biggest fan, and I hope it does not change into something else, I hope it does not fail me in the future.",1454198400,4,906,3.8449197860962565

5864918,5,B00DY64BLG,"It is hard for me to be objective about Arrow, because it is what I dreamed about as a kid but never saw: A comic book TV series that was both true to the source material and original in its approach. The Arrowverse is becoming a fully realized vision of a universe of heroes and, with the advent of the sister series The Flash, superheroes. The frequent nods to the whole DC world, such as dropping Ted Kord's name, is gratifying to someone who has been reading comics for far longer than he cares to admit. It is a little regretful that DC has not opted to unify its movie and TV world the way Marvel has, but even though it means the CW family of shows is missing the megastars like Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, it is still totally enjoyable. Perhaps the best thing about Arrow is the decision to take years to complete Oliver Queen's story. Major characters from the Green Arrow comics, such as Black Canary and Speedy, are just now beginning to take shape, and all are developing slowly. Oliver himself is still growing and changing. Arrow also is becoming richer by adding new characters such as John Diggle and highly modified ones like Felicity Smoak. With its own take on familiar villains like Deadshot, Deathstroke and Bronze Tiger, the series continues to stay interesting, and based on the first two seasons, is just getting stronger. The only negative for me is the overlay of soap opera type drama, but that is just a quibble. I plan to keep buying these, because I don't get the CW on my satellite. But they are worth having anyway for the ability to rewatch plus all the bonus features and deleted scenes.",1453593600,2,1628,4.540816326530612

I won't be buying future seasons, especially since the writers continue to change Oliver's story each season and where he was during his absence from home.

Revenge plots are my favorite, so this season was right up my alley. This season really showcased the amazing team of Oliver Queen, Felicity Smoak, and John Diggle.  This is what pulls me back to the show every week.  There are a few moments of What?! a few threads I thought never developed as full as they could (Isabel Rochev for one) but overall, a very satisfying season and a fabulous follow up to its first season.  Season 2 brings all the best parts of Season 1 forward, develops the relationships you loved there, and dumped a lot of what didn't work to try new things.

Arrow-the-soap-opera continues. A lot of the acting improves (or, honestly, maybe it's just that Oliver's not wound quite so tightly any more, so Stephen's allowed to show a little more), and many jaws unclench slightly (c'mon Willa Holland, you can do it!). The fight choreography already couldn't be improved upon (and I should have mentioned that in my first season review), and the actors and stunt doubles must be having great fun. Adding Grant Gustin as Barry Allen (hey, isn't that the guy who becomes the Flash? Hmmm...) to the Arrowverse pleased many of us.

5865030,5,B00DY64BLG,"(Basic series flow in the review)
The first Season was indeed compelling viewing, the question was, could it be equalled, i feel it almost
certainly has been, the second season has 23 exciting and action packed episodes to enjoy with the
bonus of a catch-up episode at the beginning to remind us of what had gone before.
'Oliver' is racked with guilt because he'd been unable to save his best friend 'Tommy Merlyn' during
the machine-triggered earthquake that had all but flattened the area in 'Starling City' known as the
Glades.
As with the first series during each episode we not only follow 'Oliver's' deeds to rid the City of villains
we also follow his story on the island, his struggle for survival and how he became who he is today.
In the first episode following 'Tommy's' death 'Oliver' has returned to the Island to reflect on what had
happened and clear his mind, friends and fellow confidants 'John Diggle' and 'Felicity Smoak' who assist
'Oliver' in his role as 'The Hood' fly out to the Island to bring their friend home, 'Starling City' need the
vigilante back on the streets.
Back home his mother 'Moira' is in jail awaiting trial for her part in the deaths of over 500 in the Glades
as a result of her association with 'Tommy's' father 'Malcolm Merlyn'
In the ruins of the Glades ruthless gangs are thriving, 'Oliver' is certainly needed in his beloved city,
he wants to do things differently this time because of the loss of his friend, he also no longer wants to
be known as 'The Hood'' but by the name 'Arrow'
Street-wise 'Roy Harper' boyfriend to 'Oliver's' sister 'Thea' wants to be part of 'Arrows' campaign to
rid the streets of corruption and violence, 'Arrow' doesn't feel that 'Roy' has the skills to join him on
the streets but could be of use to identify criminal elements in his neck of the woods.
Ex girl-friend to both himself and more recently 'Tommy' isn't coping after Tommy's' death and has
taken to drink and drugs which will almost certainly affect her career in the legal department in which
she works, whilst 'Laura's' father 'Quentin Lance' has been demoted in the police department because
of his recent dealings with 'The Hood' (Arrow) he had come to realize that the actions of the vigilante
were for the good of the city, which is currently the opposite of how the department chiefs see it
Early on, 'Arrow' receives help from a mysterious masked woman during his encounters with the city's
low-life. but who is she ?
'Arrow' faces a series of resourcefull villains including the sinister 'Doll-Maker' and indeed adversary's
in the shape of those he'd considered a friend of both past and present who have access to the serum
found on the Island.
The series as mentioned earlier continues to follow 'Oliver's deeds of present day alongside continuing
to look back upon his 5 years on the Island.
There become several more persons that learn of 'Arrows' true identity as time goes on, will he be able
to continue keeping it secret from those closest to him ?
Again as with the first series it manages to cover 'Oliver's' life both day and night in 'Starling City' as well
as building a profile of all the lead characters , a strategy that enhances viewing pleasure in this well made
and exciting series.
There are one or two surprises in store along the way, some a little predictable perhaps, some not so.
This, again, is a brilliant and absorbing made-for-TV series......am so looking forward to the third.

5865031,5,B00DY64BLG,"Great show, it's full of action and can be extremely funny from time to time. The the entire cast is perfect and made me a huge Arrow fan now! Watching this show even got me interested in the Green Arrow comics! Good to see the underrated hero can get his time in the spotlight!

Overall great purchase glad I bought it. I've seen all 3 seasons multiple times and I am extremely excited for the 4th season to come out this fall! I suggest this TV show to teens/young adults/mature adults, Season 1 does have a lot more ""violence"" compared to the other seasons but its pretty mild. The women in the show are very attractive and there was very mild romance scenes in season 3 but theres nothing that should make parents concerned and it's an element of the show that keeps fans coming back for more!  TEAM OLLICITY!

Grant Gustin who portrays Barry Allen aka The Flash makes a few appearances as well.  I have really enjoyed the story.

We learn more about Oliver's time on the island, as well as what happened to Sara. The introduction of Sara changes the dynamic of the team, and puts Oliver back with a Lance. Poor Felicity!

Oliver's enemies are racking up and the pressure is on. He must save his family, even as he despises his mother for a deep family secret that could destroy them.

I LOVE the introduction of the Suicide Squad in this season. I'm coming to this season late, so the buzz of the film about these characters is all around. The introduction of this group of criminals is done seamlessly- and isn't forced into the story.

Oliver's character needs to get past the long-suffering, guilt-ridden look soon after this season, though.",1436659200,,795,4.697841726618705

5865121,5,B00DY64BLG,Awesome,1434844800,,7,7.0
5865122,5,B00DY64BLG,"After quickly getting addicted to the CWs new superhero show Arrow, I couldn't wait for season two to start.  Fortunately, it continued to build on the wonderful first season with more action and drama.

The show is based on the DC Comics character of Green Arrow.  Honestly, I know little about him outside of this series, but thats okay.  What is here works so well I don't need to know much more.

In the aftermath of the season one finale, Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) returned to the island where hed been stranded for five years.  However, it isn't long before Diggle (David Ramsey) and Felicity (Emily Rett Rickards) head back there to track him down and get him to return to Starling City.  With his mother, Moyra (Susanna Thompson), in jail, it falls to him to run Queen Consolidated, and his return has come just in time since Isabel Rochev (guest star Summer Glau) has been brought in by the board and doesnt seem to have the same vision for the future of the business as Oliver does.  Meanwhile his sister Thea (Willa Holland) is running the nightclub he started.

Unfortunately, Olivers return is just in time since someone has arrived in town with designs to destroy the city.  However, this time it is much more personal than Oliver knows.  Will he figure out the plot in time to stop it?  Who is behind everything?

Actually, the second season is even more complicated than this since I haven't really talked about Roy (Colton Haynes), Theas boyfriend and Olivers secret apprentice in the justice business.  Then theres the Lance family.  Quentin (Paul Blackthorne) has been demoted to patrol while Laurel (Katie Cassidy) has joined the DAs office and is targeting the Vigilante (aka Oliver).  But the big surprise is the new superhero in town with some ties to Olivers time on the island.

Once again, those flashbacks to Olivers time on the island proved to be the weakness to the show.  They definitely tie in more to what happened this year, but I just don't see the point of them most of the time and felt they slowed down the present day story.

However, the present day story more than makes up for any weakness.  You might have figured out that there are a ton of characters in this show, but thats because there are tons of things happening.  There are some case of the week type episodes, but they are fewer this season, instead tying in much of what happens to the overall season arc or at least the character development.  The show is very suspenseful at times, too, with the characters facing overwhelming odds.  I had a hard time figuring out how they were going to succeed.

There is plenty of character growth here this season.  Just about everyone gets grow to a certain extent, and watching them deal with everything they are facing is incredible.

Which means all the actors have stepped up their game this season.  We might have one or two scenes that aren't the best, but there wasn't anything that threw me out of the show.  I especially love Felicity, who gets the funniest lines and some serious growth this season.

Because the show is more grounded in reality, it relies more on stunts than special effects, although both are handled perfectly when they appear.

As a fun note, they set up the CWs new series The Flash with a couple episode guest spot early in the season.  I cant wait for that show to appear this fall.

The second season is being released in the DVD only set and a Blu-Ray/DVD/UltraViolet combo set priced at only $10 more than the regular set.  Both sets feature all 23 episodes from season 2 in their native wide screen and full surround.  The sets also have the same extras, which include an episode commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and three featurettes, one that chronicles Oliver's journey in the eyes of Starling City so far, one that looks at the action and special effects of the show, and one that focuses even more on the stunt work of the show.

Arrow is exactly what it sets out to be  a strong and fun superhero show.  You won't be disappointed with season two at all.",1434672000,,4050,4.598326359832636
5865123,5,B00DY64BLG,Great show - cant wait to get season 3,1434672000,,38,3.3333333333333335
5865124,4,B00DY64BLG,"While Smallville still holds the record for the longest TV show based on a DC character, it was surpassed in about every other way by Arrow in just two seasons. If the series first season did a pretty good job of introducing the character of Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) and his arrow-slinging alter ego while balancing simultaneous storylines of his survival on a remote island with his return from the dead in Starling City. It established some long-term and short-term villains, looked at the difficulty arising from living two lives, and it started the slow build of the second seasons primary villain: Deathstroke. With that setup courtesy of the first season, the second season starts off sprinting and rarely ever lets up despite the introduction of a number of important characters and backdoor spin-off pilot for CWs new DC show, The Flash. Arrow is a perfect example of just how good junk food television can be.

(Also, don't worry if you don't know who Deathstroke is; if you didn't already know, knowing hes a villain spoils nothing for you, and if you did, then you already knew he was bound to be one of the shows big bads anyways when he appeared in the first season.)

The second season starts five months after Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman) and Moira Queen (Susanna Thompson), Olivers mother, unleashed an serious earthquake on Starling Citys slums killing hundreds of innocent people, including Olivers best friend (and Malcolms son) Tommy (Colin Donnell). In the aftermath, Malcolm is presumed dead at the hands of the Arrow and Moira Queen is in jail awaiting her trial for her part in the tragedy. The shame of Moiras actions have driven both Oliver and Thea (Willa Holland) away from her side, and both of them bury themselves in their respective hobbies, being a nighttime vigilante and being a nightclub manager.

For Oliver, the streets have gotten a little more dangerous as unknown forces have begun experimenting on abductees, including Theas boyfriend Roy Harper (Colton Haynes) with a chemical that seems to give them incredible strength but also severe anger issues. Its a combination Oliver has seen once before during his stay on the island, and flashbacks to that point in his life shed light on that as well as the arrival of a new ally (Caity Lotz) who has similarly returned from death and quickly joins up with Team Arrow (they don't actually call it that) alongside Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) and Diggle (David Ramsey).

The second season deserves considerable credit for doing a dozen different things and doing them all well. First and foremost it both definitively ties Olivers time on the island back to the modern story in multiple meaningful ways and it ends the season with the flashbacks getting a whole new setting. (The latter was especially badly needed because by the second seasons end theyve effectively maxed out the number of things they could believably have happen there without it seeming ridiculous). Second it establishes a number of different teams (like the Suicide Squad and, in a small part, the cast of The Flash) without any serious detriment to the seasons narrative. Sure, things kind of jolt to a stop so the Suicide Squad-related episodes can occur, but by keeping Oliver and company involved or busy doing other things in the margins, they feel like tangential lines of thought instead of just outright and sudden turns in the overarching story.

Of course, with all the characters the story is juggling some of them, like Katie Cassidys Laurel Lance, kind of get the shaft with an alcohol abuse story that keeps her busy rather than keeping her interesting. The other Lances in the cast have more substantial happenings, like her fathers (Paul Blackthrone) demotion and how he deals with it, following his cooperation with the vigilante and that cooperation then being discovered by higher ups in his department. Its an unexpected realistic but seemingly minor thing, but considering how seldom people with insider knowledge of a superhero get subpoenaed for that information in comic books, movies, and TV shows, its oddly satisfying. Laurel, by contrast is just a sounding board for that development and a few other major ones (like one involving the seasons secondary villain). Shes there so the actions of others have a witness, but besides that she just becomes a drunk.

Blu-ray Bonus Features

The set includes the season on Blu-ray, DVD, and as an Ultraviolet digital copy, along with extras like production featurettes on the series stunts, special effects, and story. A gag reel, some deleted scenes, the 2013 Comic-Con panel, and a season one episode-long recap round out the set.

If you disengage any requirement for consistency, this is an entertaining series; it has a complicated plot and it moves quickly.  It was purchased on a whim and I don't regret it.  But here's an example of inconsistency.  Bag guy says ""arrows are such an ineffective weapon"" but it seems to be one of their chief means of killing people.  Bad superhuman guys have ""almost the density of concrete,""  but bad guy arrows completely penetrate them (stick out their back)(with no mention or reason to believe there is anything special about bad-guy arrows).  I think you see what I mean.  Nevertheless, it has its moments.  Good guy Sara, is well played by toughie Caity Lotz; and Paul Blackthorn also give a believable performance as her policeman father.

5865170,2,B00DY64BLG,"Not recommended for your younglings. It plays well to the culture & media we live with today: bi-racial / diversity; bi-sexual / lesbianism; wealth, bodies & beauty shown to be most important in life as seen with cheating parents and a shallow main character sleeping with every slobbering female in the episodes (except his sister and mother); dysfunctional families: lying, deceit, adultery & addiction; self-pity, pouting self-obsession & self- centeredness. Then there are credibility issues: shooting arrows against full auto weapons by moving targets at hundreds of yards; a hacker that accesses every system known to man - instantly; nonsensical chemistry; leaving sub-plots unfinished. Several key actors over-act with contrived intensity that is humorous. Like 6th grade level plays made up as you go. The one black male actor with a UK accent (""Walter"") is the best of the lot as far as skills in acting & integrity of character. If you are into other DC / Marvel franchises that have testosterone and plots without all the constant female emotional & estrogen-laden catharsis, you will unlikely be able to get thru most of the Arrow episodes. My 2-cents. Besides the Batman franchise, a movie that comes to mind that is much better done - with a similar plot of a wealthy man enduring a life change, struggling with his dark side, returning to his city for good - would be the movie The Shadow with Alec Baldwin (also based upon a comic caricature.)",1432771200,,1460,5.012345679012346

The characters show so much emotion and the writers have conceived excellent story lines moving back and forth from the past to the present.  The actors who for the most part are not familiar to me are excellent.  The villains and heroes are not necessarily all black and white, there are levels or gray.

Emily is just a joy as Felicity.  She is funny, smart, courageous, nave, heroic, all wrapped into a beautiful young woman.  She and Stephen have great chemistry together.

5865390,1,B00DY64BLG,"I remember liking the first season. Granted, I was looking at the Wiki every few episodes in order to figure out who was who, but a lot of that was trying to figure out the comic book mythology and makes sure that Captain Jack had really gotten so fat since Torchwood. This season I was looking up Wiki because I honestly did not know who any of these people were. Even when I had just seen them in previous episodes, I forgot them. No one registered as interesting enough to care about.

There are so many things to hate about this season. First, the acting is uniformly bland. Like many movies aimed at teenagers, the casting director chose from the same bland white 20-something pool. There's a token black guy but everyone else is white and good looking in a classic boring sense. No one is fat. No one has buggy eyes. No one even has a big nose. It's simply the most boring cast available. It might not be so bad if anyone on the show could act, but they can't act. They just kind of say their lines and look constipated.

Second, the filming is terrible. I realize that the directors are going for the whole Batman vibe with Oliver Queen as the caped vigilante complete with the stupid growling voice but every shot looks like black bears fighting in a coal mine. The action settings are not exciting when you can't see what anyone is doing. Beyond the dark green, there is really no color palette to speak of.

Third, the characters are boring. I realize that I stated that the actors were boring, but the writers aren't doing them any favors by making them say such stupid lines. The cop dad character is a fountain of cop cliches. Laurel gets a drunk story line in the middle but it seems more like petulance than any decent addiction story. The villains and the helpers all seem interchangeable. The main drain on the show is Oliver Queen who is just a bad Batman clone as far as the writers are concerned. In the comics, he is a hippie. Writers love to have him choose between shooting a store owner and a robber and shoot the store owner due to the high markups. He's funny and cranky. The writers use none of this material. It's impossible to care about this bland superhero and his bland hangers-on.

Fourth, those flashbacks are obnoxious. They might have had a purpose in the first season when the viewers had to be caught up on the background of how Oliver Queen trained to be a superhero archer while hanging out on the island. In this season they only serve to drag down the already turgid episodes with background information that no one requires. They basically come down to ""Oliver got into a bunch of fights and hung out with characters tangential to the action"" every episode.

Fifth, when the plots aren't boring they are stupid. For example, the mother spends the early parts of the season on trial for murder stemming from the big evil plot. At a certain point she is found non-guilty. So she runs for mayor. Apparently, she has a big business so why shouldn't she run for mayor - beyond the fact that everyone THINKS THAT SHE KILLED 500 PEOPLE???? Not even O.J. Simpson was so blatant as to run for public office after his trial. And that's not even the stupidest thing that happens on the show. And even stupider plot is when Oliver's sister turns out to be his half-sister because the mother slept with Captain Jack. This is obvious from the beginning and it keeps coming up even though it's a boring story. There's even one point where the mother states that Oliver must never know because it will tear him apart - because a fully grown man can't handle the idea that his parents cheated on each other?

Sixth, this show is a network show and here's where I offer a tepid defense of its awfulness. Instead of a 13-episode cable show with a clear beginning, middle and end, this show is supposed to be something that people tun into on a weekly basis. So the facts are repeated and the plot gets dragged out. Still, there are network shows and network shows and this network show is not giving us interesting or decent episodes adn the overall plto is terrible.

I remember Smallville as being very cheesy and silly but I couldn't help watching it. This show sets out to be like Smallville by offering up an origin story for another DC hero. Yet, this show is so dour that it can't even get over it's stupid moments. Instead the stupid moments are taken so seriously that you wonder about the mental acumen of the show runners.",1424304000,5,4457,4.481527093596059
5865391,5,B00DY64BLG,"Excellent service and quick shipping from Amazon!

Arrow is one of my new favorite shows. Compared to older Warner Brothers comic book based shows (Smallville) it feels less cheesy/hokey and has pretty great production values. Stephen Amell, Emily Bett Rickards, Colton Haynes and Willa Holland are great casting choices; the  play between Oliver(Amell) and Felicity(Rickards) is probably the highlight of the show.

The only thing I don't really like about the show is the heavy reliance on flashback as a story telling device. It seems about half of every episode takes place in the past. I understand the importance of the origins for comic book heroes, but much of it feels unnecessary or that it takes up too much time. When I rewatch episodes I actually skip through the flashbacks, once was plenty. I sincerely hope that Oliver's five years on the island are synced with the his time back in Starling City, so that after the first five seasons there are no more flashbacks.

Other than that it is a terrific show, CW seems to bringing their A-game lately.",1424304000,,1062,4.883333333333334

5865522,4,B00DY64BLG,"Arrow - The Second Season  [548 2014-01-27]

Summary:
  Oliver Queen - rich playboy - is ship wrecked then marooned for five years on a remote island. He returns home with a crime fighting agenda using the disguise of a hooded archer. His purpose is not clearly defined, something about bringing a vigilantly ""justice"" to individuals on a list of urban exploiters from a notebook handed to him by his father. Needless to say Oliver gets some push back from the local authorities, the underworld bosses, his mother and his pals.

As season 2 begins we find the Arrow teamed up with two companions: John Diggle - former special forces warrior and Felicity Smoak computer wiz - and secretly in love with Oliver Queen/Arrow. Oliver renounces his murderous methods of taking down the enemies of Sterling City - he become less deadly but nonetheless still a force for good. Ghosts from his past conflict him remorselessly in Season 2

  The creative team for ""Arrow"" had to somehow integrate a comic hero - The Green Arrow - and a contemporary action TV series utilizing, of course, real actors. How well this concept has been successful is a judgment left to the individual viewers, but as of the date of these comments the show has been renewed for a third season. As they say vox populi vox Dei.

Content:
  The Season Two package consists of 5 disks and 23 episodes originally show on the CW Network during the period October 2013 through May 2014. Also included are several special features on disk 5 that I founding modestly interesting.

Positive Comments:
 Many episodes include deleted scenes, which are not to be missed. Some are quite lengthy and are interesting and informative concerning that particular episode. The deleted scenes are identified with an icon next to the episode titles - a helpful viewers aid.
 Each episode juggles multiple plot lines: one reoccurring theme detailing Oliver's convoluted misadventures on the Island during his 5-year involuntary vacation and then a jumble of scenes of Arrow meeting out justice to some hard case dudes.
 The action sequences are quite intensely interesting but strange only the bad dude get killed.
 I watched the DVD in sequence and with the deleted scenes and the few extras ""special feature' found it was worth the purchase price.
 Season 2 used a flashback technique to introduce each episode - you know what I mean: a voice tells us ""Previously on Arrow"". Much better that season 1 reuse of the same introduction over and over again.

The Cast:
 Steven Amell as Oliver Queen is more that adequate for the demanding emotional and physical role he is cast in. David Ramsey as John Diggle Oliver's sidekick is a plus. Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity Smoak is real cute with those glasses she is always wearing.

Negative Comments:
 There are a vast number of important plot events placed in motion in season 2 - way too many - is my brain too small or what?  I could not keep everyone's identities and relationships quite in sync - who is behind that mask and where does he or she ""fit' in the big picture so to speak. If you miss several shows you may by scratching your noggin asking what's this all about. Not the show you can skip and come back too.
 Two principal characters are resurrected from the dead - yes they show up not as your typical ghost but in the regular body - or their own body that is. Since there was no explanation this completely confounding this viewer - I could only assume this was a joke on the audience. [Say, guys lets bring back so and so - just have him show up - I mean the viewers won't mind so lets do it!]  I was not amused and felt I was being played for a dope.
 I still found it hilarious that all the young ladies and men in this show were just knockout beautiful and handsome - and, oh yes, dressed to the nines - just unbelievable.

Recommendations:
  To be honest this show is mindless viewing candy. I found it entertaining but refrained from trying to look for any kind of plot logic to the drama. Just enjoy the nice looking people, the convoluted - nonsensical plot, and wild action sequences.",1422316800,5,4103,4.645429362880886

5865593,2,B00DY64BLG,"A miracle drug called ""Mirakuru"" is the unifying thread of season 2. Unfortunately it has considerably less credibility than ""The Undertaking"" as the unifying thread of season 1. It's too far out, too comic bookish, to fit in well with the first season which appeared to make an effort to stick to a grim reality. What happens to the character ""Roy Harper"" is especially hard to swallow. The most interesting character of both seasons is Detective Lance who makes an evolution from a Javert-like police officer to a man who is learning more and more the gap between the law and justice. He makes an effort to always ""do the right thing"" and suffers increasingly because of it. There was no need for the ""Mirakuru"" thread. The show would have done well enough to simply follow up on the first season. I will not be purchasing season 3. I'm not even sure if I will complete watching the episodes of season 2.

5865638,5,B00DY64BLG,"When ""Arrow"" first debuted on the CW I was cautiously optimistic. Back then, I was young and believed that no depiction of Green Arrow would outdo the one seen in ""Smallville"". Boy was I wrong--Stephen Amell is the real deal. He plays Oliver in different stages of his life: the young, brash, bratty playboy marooned on a godforsaken island, and the mature, stoic, no-nonsense vigilante who brings justice to Starling City. In this season, you begin to see where both personalities begin to intersect. This season is more ""comic book-y"" than Season 1. The first season stuck to a realistic, Nolanverse Batman style. While the series still retains its dark, brooding environment, it is not afraid to delve into the more fantastical aspects of the DC Universe, with the official introduction of superpowers. For a long-time comic book fan, the surprising characters introduced this season is more than worth the price of purchase.",1420243200,4,928,5.071895424836601

David Ramsey as The Arrow's friend, partner and sparring partner, John Diggle was the perfect casting choice.  However I have to say Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity Smoak is what brings that extra spark to the show.  Felicity and Oliver are without a doubt the cutest couple on television right now.  There isn't another actress anywhere who could have played Felicity better than Emily.  She is so much fun to watch!

5865909,5,B00DY64BLG,"WB COMICS FORMULA BASED ON BATMAN MODEL

Oliver Queen/Arrow is a good, well-meaning guy. His mother says: ""You see only the good in people, even when they don't deserve it."" Played terrifically by stubble-faced Stephen Amell, he maximizes audience compassion, sympathy and admiration. WB was wise to avoid a neurotic primo uomo for this role, and Amell is solid and indispensable for making the show work.

Oliver Queen has been through years of isolated island hell, and he continues in Starling City's brand of it. Because he's not nearly as intelligent and worldly as Bruce Wayne, arch villains most always far outdistance his imagination and thinking, and he mainly reacts instead of leads. So bad guys and gals outthink him plenty. But he keeps trying and plodding, and gradually learns and grows. After all, he's a young guy who was completely out of touch for 5 years.

John Diggle: A seasoned, wise, tough YOUNG Alfred Pennyworth-type whom Arrow leans on and who's in plenty of action with his boss.

Felicity Smoak: Arrow's un-disabled Oracle-type IT expert, and with lots of dry and all too scarce show humor, even though she's never been a martial sort. Lots of the actor's catchy dialogue is regrettably obscured by mumbling and mushy diction.

Sara Lance: A deadly Huntress-sort as ""Canary."" Sometime lover of Oliver, and daughter of policeman Lance.

Laurel Lance: Silver St. Cloud-type, sometime lover of Oliver, and daughter of policeman Lance.

Quentin Lance: Police detective, akin to Jim Gordon, with two grown daughters and who's learned the hard way (like Gordon) to trust and help Arrow. They meet on rooftops, too. Maybe someday he'll be police commissioner.

""Arrow"" Comic Formula:  Fantasy story and writing techniques crafted to keep the characters constantly in severe distress and hypertension, and so keep viewers tense, stressed, cliff-hanging, and morbidly curious and fascinated about what will happen next. More specifically on what will happen next with the mostly screwed-up good guys and extremely embittered and hateful bad guys. So drama kings and drama ""Queens"" abound! Warner's has honed this formula through decades of Batman, at least, and executes it in ""Arrow"" with skillful and brutal power. ""Arrow"" Season 2 demonstrates a lot of avoidable torment, no matter what the intentions, that honesty really is the best policy (except for trying to conceal Arrow's secret identity, which nonetheless gets repeatedly compromised) and that ends really don't justify means.

SOCIOLOGICAL THOUGHT EXPERIMENT - Got a Problem? Get Panicked and Violent.

The frenetic, relentless angst all the characters suffer in ""Arrow"" is something WB pulls off powerfully with its longtime experience with comic fantasies.  If real-life people were embroiled in these situations, they'd hardly live to 40 due to premature strokes, heart attacks, hypertension, anorexia, hyper-insomnia, addictions, nervous breakdowns, and suicides -- if the bad guys didn't snuff 'em out first.

And this is where ""Arrow"" can qualify as a sort of sociological thought experiment. Even if unanticipated and unappreciated by WB, ""Arrow"" does depict individual and societal ""what-ifs,"" if lives were to go mostly in those shattering ways.

""Arrow,"" and other such high-anxiety comic fantasies, powerfully portray visions of humanity frantically struggling to cope with even the next minute or two.  If such visions gain more and more appeal and traction, maybe they might even have more social impact on actually materializing. So shows like this are ripe for studying as types of sociological thought experiments. The show belongs to a category of portrayals that might be correlated with actual social developments -- if real developments ever do increasingly come to emulate desperate and frantic and frenetic comic fantasies. So besides thrilling entertainment, ""Arrow"" may thus be one more exciting media ""advertising"" example for sociological study, and what social-science investigations might find based on turbulent and violent comic shows as potential role models and social influences. Besides commercials, the content sure does advertise a lot for certain lifestyles and societal situations. While traumatic, you sure can't deny they're exciting, and so perhaps appealing and even ultimately influential on real life.",1416614400,6,4328,5.429210134128167

I was a HUGE fan of both seasons of Arrow until season 2 episode 13 when the producers decided to include a homosexual relationship. I am a strong Christian and find horror and disgust in homosexuality. Arrow was a TV show me and my entire family (my ten-year-old brother included) very much enjoyed together. But after watching that ONE episode I am beyond angry and have NO interest whatsoever to continue watching. Very, very disappointed and angry.",1414281600,3,518,4.766666666666667

5866014,4,B00DY64BLG,"With the start of the second season of Arrow, effort went toward making the show more representative of the female population, less hating-on-people-with-money and, thankfully, less about a sociopathic, serial-killing, body-guard crushing, random-working-stiff shooting, island lunatic.

The new addition to the cast, brilliant Caity Lotz, in the role of Black Canary, a feminine, kind-hearted, warrior woman who doesn't hate men and think they should all die for staring at her chest, but who, also, doesn't hate women or think they are all witches. It is a rare portrayal of a well-rounded, woman who advanced in her life beyond the petty jealousies of high school and is greatly appreciated.

Additionally, rather than spend his time murdering body guards, leaving their wives and children with nothing, Oliver Queen (Arrow) has moved on to targeting actual criminals, which was a lovely change in plot, given the first season's message of kill-everyone-you-don't-like-even-if-they're-an-innocent-bystander, and they continued that redirect by giving us an Arrow who has stopped endeavoring to kill anything that moves when he is on his little missions. In fact, he begins this year, actively endeavoring to spare the lives of those who can be spared, especially random guards and paid henchmen who transport naughty things and operate elevators and drive trucks for the naughty kingpins sprinkled throughout the season. To make sure the audience knew about this change in priorities right from the get go, the producers added the voice over in the opening credits, having the character inform us that he has been inspired, by his departed friend, to become something other than a killer. It was the right call and made the show permissible viewing for some in my family.

Beyond this, great consideration was paid to developing John Diggle as a human being, outside of his participation in Team Arrow, even allowing for the inclusion of people calling him John instead of Diggle. Furthermore, he no longer acts as the weaker participant and babysitter of the great white man. The producers saw the light and, THANKFULLY, are giving us the John Diggle we deserve, a true hero who can act alone, who can save the day, and who, quite frankly, is a better human being and far more intelligent than Oliver Queen. An end to the racism that plagued season one and this turn toward a genuine and accurate portrayal of an African American soldier, who finally reminds me of the ones I've known during my life so far, I think, is my favorite change in the series. John is a stand alone character, a force to be reckoned with and is often the voice of reason and experience, guiding an Arrow who would, without John Diggle, be dead or running off the rails.

Felicity Snow, fan favorite with good reason, is sweet and smart and capable and, sadly, a bit of a doormat. By the end of the season that doormat situation becomes uncomfortable if you, like me, prefer her, as a human being, to the endlessly in need of therapy and some quality 5-Htp wreck-of-a-man that is Oliver Queen. (Though, that situation has a wonderful moment coming up in Episode 2 of Season 3, for those of us who don't like the seemingly endless doormat situation they've set up with her character. It involves Superman and a very tall building.)

As for the downside, or, rather, the con of this show:  They like to kill people, they like it a lot, they don't apologize for it, they need a psychologist in that writer's room. For some reason, there is no effort made to allow us to view the growth and change of the core cast over time as, it seems, each year, they are going to kill off major characters (won't say who) and leave us without all of that brilliant story that the now missing person could have given us. They did it in season one. They did it in season two. And, I'm sorry to say, they did it in season three, already. It is a great misfortune, the curse of a shortsighted writer. Sometimes people forget to think ahead to what they are losing in the killing of a major character. It isn't just an actor missing from set. The death of a main character is the death of everything they could have done, been, gone through, said, engineered, taken back, failed at, broken, built, changed or defined. A death of a character is a death of an entire world and, in season two, the big death was a huge mistake that all the lovely John Borrowman season-three face-time in the world cannot unmake.

Overall, I'd say it is safe for teenagers, not children, with words of caution to parents. Katie Cassidy is anorexic and has been, on and off, for years. She is used in pro-anna and ""my friend ed"" literature and on sites as ""thinspiration"" and you should not allow your girls or your boys to watch this without sitting down with them and showing them the difference between a healthy body, like Caity Lotz (thin but muscular and fit) or the magnificent Alex Kingston who is very fit and healthy and shines in her role as the mother of Sara and Laurel Lance, and, on the other side of the health debate, a diseased body like Katie's. When shots of her legs (that don't touch and don't have any moving flesh on them) and her spinal column (knobby to such an extent that a look at her diet is not necessary for diagnosis of being significantly underweight) come up on the screen, ask your daughter and your son how they feel seeing a beautiful woman waste away to nothing rather than assert her power and reclaim her health and ask them who they would cast to play Laurel Lance, if Hollywood didn't prefer women to disappear.

That having been said, this is leagues ahead of where it was in season one and is a relatively fun view.",1414195200,4,5698,4.719597989949749

Relationships will constantly change and everyone will have secrets...that aren't genuinely bad, but to keep the Soap moving the characters have to act like their morality has somehow been violated.
Regarding ""action"" it consists of half-lighting or strobe-light effects (supposedly from muzzle flashes or some other source) and sped-up footage.
It's hard to really care about a character.  Ms. Smoke and ""Sin"" begin and end my list.  Thankfully a few get killed (no spoilers from me, tho!) but not enough.
Still, the plots at least toyed with having an ""arc"" and overall was an improvement over the totally repetitious Season One.  Perhaps it'll be good in a year or two, if it lasts that long.",1413244800,2,821,4.920289855072464

5866154,5,B00DY64BLG,"Fair warning, this will contain spoilers from season 1, and hints, but no major giveaways from season 2.  If you have not yet seen season 1, avoid the first couple paragraphs.

Season 2 starts off after the events of season 1.  After taking out Malcolm Merlin but failing to prevent the earthquake machine from going off, Oliver retreats to the island and the season opens with Felicity and Diggle trying to track him down and convince him to come back to Starling City.  Moiria is in jail awaiting trial for conspiracy and murder, and Thea has taken over the club.  Oliver wants to give up being the vigilante in large part because of the death of Tommy and the fact that they never truly got to reconcile.  But as it becomes clear he needs to don the hood again he takes a no killing vow similar to Batman's,

This season has a lot of storylines being inter-weaved.  The main story told in both the flashbacks and in real time is Slade Wilson's transformation into Deathstroke.  As was the case in season 1, the show jumps between flashbacks of events on the island and present day, yet this season the flashbacks are more closely tied to present day events.  The show brings in many more DC comics characters including the mid-season set up to The Flash which is being spun off into its own series, and sets up ra's al ghul who is rumored to play a large role in season 3.  It also sees the return of some season 1 characters, and has more than a few surprise twists.  It continues the tradition of not being afraid to kill off characters, which does not necessarily mean you have seen the end of them given the flashback format of the show.

The show has a lot of characters and stories to juggle, and I think for the most part it does it well.  Of course some of the ancillary and recurring characters are absent for large chunks of the time, but all in all I think the writers were able to give all the main characters something to do without sacrificing story quality.  The acting and writing in the show continue to be very good, which makes it work as well as it does.

For those who get the blu rays, the format is exactly the same as the season 1 release.  There are 4 blu ray discs and then 5 DVDs.  Unfortunately the blu rays do not play in a season/uninterrupted mode so if you stop before all the shows on the disc have played you have to find your spot again.  As far as extras go, there are deleted scenes for many episodes, part of the comic-con panel discussion, a few featurettes and a gag reel.  Enough to keep those who like going through the bonus material happy.

Ultimately if you liked season 1, you will probably like this season as well.  In some ways it is not as dark as the first season (at least as far as the Oliver/Arrow character is concerned, but in some ways it is even more dark.  If you are a fan of the superhero genre (but can live with changes from the comic books), then it is definitely worth getting into this series.",1413072000,,2962,4.335753176043557

5866317,4,B00DY64BLG,Comic book fans will enjoy the original story with references to characters and events in the books. Enjoy the acting and action sequences. There are times that it gets repetitive with the same damsel in distress but I feel if you don't binge watch several episodes in a row this should bother most viewers. There are tie ins to other characters and shows that add to the appeal of watching.,1412208000,,391,4.6

5866402,4,B00DY64BLG,"DC Comics characters continue to rule the television world and the proof is in Arrow: The Complete Second Season Blu-ray and DVD sets. Every actor in the cast is invested in their role and strives to provide quality entertainment in each episode. The fight choreography creates some of the greatest action sequences ever seen in super hero movies and TV. Good writing doesnt hurt when it comes to keeping audiences engaged week after week, either.

After the Glades are ravaged by the Undertaking, Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) retreats to the island he was stranded on for so many years. Arrow is unable to face the citizens and friends he feels hes failed. At the plea of Diggle (David Ramsey) and Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards), he returns to discover Starling City is worse off than ever. Oliver finds himself pitted against old and new villains alike as he struggles to fend off evil and protect those he loves.

The Blu-ray edition of Arrow: The Complete Second Season is presented in 1080p High-Definition 16x9 (1.78.1) coupled with DTS-HD MA: English 5.1 audio. The video quality is flawless and gives viewers no reason to be distracted from all the action and excitement taking place onscreen. The surround sound puts you right in the middle of the jungles of the island and the noisy streets of Starling City.

Those who love bonus material will be impressed with Arrow: The Complete Second Season Blu-ray set. A bonus recap episode reminds viewers of the events of the first season. Three featurettes entitled From Vigilante to Hero, How Did They Do That? The Visual Effects of Arrow, and Wirework: The Impossible Moves of Arrow take us behind the scenes of the show. Unaired scenes, a gag reel, and the Arrow 2013 Comic-Con Panel complete the special features.

Arrow: The Complete Second Season is unrated, even though it would merit a PG-13 if put before the MPAA. Theres a whole lot of violence and bloodshed when our hooded vigilante comes face-to-face with the criminals who cross him. Some adult situations and mild language are found as well.

If you're not watching Arrow already, you need to be. Strong scripting, great acting, and breakneck pacing make it an experience you don't want to miss. Marvel might be the Kings of the Cinema right now when it comes to compact two hour super hero tales. However, DC reigns supreme if you're looking for longevity and complex dramas that keep your attention for the long haul.",1411689600,2,2438,4.865060240963856

5866458,5,B00DY64BLG,"This show is awesome!!! You know that sensation? The one where right after you wake up you still have these ghost like images and snippets of the dreams you were just having floating around the edges of your mind in your mental peripheral vision, bathed in a fog as they quickly fade away and no matter how hard you concentrate or try to grasp onto those little bits the faster they disappear? This is nothing like that at all, Arrow is well written, well acted, and very well thought out almost like the fuzz on a velvet painting when you rub it against the grain and it gets all prickly. I have only seen the first season and about a third of the second season but man it is more addictive than toaster crumbs on a low fat mustard and apple pop tart strudel. This show is extremely entertaining and I know that you can use maple syrup as a hair gel on your dog although it can be hard to get out but I don't let the addictive nature of this show over power the pure entertainment of it. I am really impressed with Stephen Amell as an actor but the price of fast food jumping so diversely from county to county makes being a fan of Canadian muskrat jug bands hard to acknowledge even to friends and family so I can see where he will get a lot of roles in the future and not just superhero roles I am willing to bet. The actor playing Diggle is participating in the episodes but some of his lines are directed towards me, just yesterday I was watching an episode where he said something to Stephens character but he was looking at me and doing an impersonation of the gremlins taunting Mrs. Deagle but he was saying ""Diggle Diggle Diggle"". It's not the first time actors have sent me messages so I'm used to it by now, anyhoo, it's about time for my meds so I'll wrap this up with a quick quote... "" never trust the banana that won't look you in the eye when it's time to water the day lilies"" - Crusty the homeless guy that hangs out behind they medical supply warehouse!",1411344000,,1972,4.247340425531915
5866459,4,B00DY64BLG,"We are big fans of superhero television and movies in my home. When the pilot and first episodes aired, I watched it with my 8 year old in mind and quickly found that the programming was not good for younger viewers. The programming includes torture and sexual overtones along with violence and murder. So we passed on the program for family viewing and I was personally into other programming and did not have the bandwidth to watch. As the new Flash program was announced and appears on the surface to be family acceptable, I thought I would have a second look at the Arrow.

While still not acceptable for younger viewers, as the first season binge was in full effect, I found myself enjoying the show more and more. The second season is even better than the first, not often seen in sophomore year. The acting continued to improve over time. The writing gets high marks from me for thread management and continuity. As I binged watched the second season, I couldn't really stop and kept wanting to see what was next.

If you have passed this show over in the past for whatever reason, stop and take the time to watch the show now. It is worth the binge and hits on several different cylinders at the same time. My one criticism is the Green Arrow premise to begin with, the rich boy turned hero. However, the show does it well with the inclusion of the island premise. Good stuff!",1411344000,,1384,4.50996015936255

5866655,5,B00DY64BLG,"My husband and I are hooked on this show!  Season 1 was amazing, and Season 2 just blew me away.  There were episodes, like every TV show, that were not done well; however, overall it rocked.  Almost every episode was better than the last, and each one was like a mini-movie.  I loved the characters before, but season 2 developed them to an all new level.

The only character/story-line that I had a problem with was that of Laurel, played by Kate Cassidy.  I don't know if it was Ms. Cassidy's acting or the writing, but this character lacked depth and emotion.  I like the character of Laurel, and hope that they break her out into a new dynamic character.  I do not like her played solely as Oliver's hurt ex-girlfriend who views herself as a victim.  This story-line got old very fast.  I'm so hoping for her to break away from the ""boys"" and become a kick-a** character who doesn't take any crap.  If she forgives Oliver for cheating on her over and over and over again, then I will lose all respect for her.

I also wish they would do more with Diggle's character, played by David Ramsey.  His acting talent is being under-utilized.  While the Suicide Squad episode was classified as a ""Diggle-centric"" episode, it lacked the essence that makes Diggle such a dynamic character.  I'm hoping for more emotion from him given what happened throughout season two.

Oliver's character, played by Stephen Amell, really grew this season.  After rewatching the first and second seasons it is clear that Mr. Amell has grown as an actor.  I truly believe his performance as Oliver Queen and as the Arrow.  I'm waiting in excited anticipation for when he becomes the Green Arrow because I think he'll do the character justice.

Finally, there is Felicity, played by Emily Bett Rickards.  She was a surprise in the first season and a shining star in the second.  Ms. Rickards talent is growing in leaps and bounds.  I truly believe we'll see her in more and more projects in the coming years.  The chemistry between her and Amell is tangible.  I did not see it during the first season, but upon rewatching it, I now understand what all the ""Olicity"" shippers are seeing.  There is clearly chemistry and I hope the writers use it.

I won't say anything about Thea, Roy, Walter, Sara, or Moria because I fear I cannot without revealing spoilers.  Just know that each character's development is growing in leaps and bounds.  This is a series that I will continue to rewatch for years to come.",1409529600,,2483,4.6307339449541285
5866656,5,B00DY64BLG,I truly enjoyed this season. I think it was so much better and so much more interesting than the previous season was. Hope that season 3 will be even better!,1409529600,,157,4.266666666666667
5866657,2,B00DY64BLG,"I guess to be fair, I am basing this off the 1st season. But from what I've seen. Batman meets 90210. If you like stereotypical characters who wouldn't look out of place in any college bar and bad guys so one dimensional they make Homer Simpson look deep then go for it. I guess I am a little out of the target demo for this show. 20 somethings who like DC comics this is for you. I will look elsewhere.",1409443200,,403,4.05

5867141,5,B00DY64BLG,"Season 1 was a little slow for me. But by season 2, The show really starts to pick up. Season 2 focuses more on Oliver's evolution into a hero as opposed to his evolution into a vigilante in season 1. Given that. I have to give a quick comparison. If you loved Christopher Nolan's batman films, you'll love this show. Especially this season. It has an overall darker tone than most superhero tv shows and movies. The action sequences look absolutely superb and in my opinion rival the action sequences found in most marvel and DC movies. The plot keeps you guessing. The villains are intriguing and the hero's are relatable. Everything about this says A+",1407110400,,654,4.646551724137931

Marvel/Disney may have the edge in the movies, but for tv series, Arrow is king as opposed to AOS which lost half it's audience because it didn't know where it was going for the first half of the season. Now it's trying to play catch up to Arrow. This fall is also the premiere of The Flash which looks to be another winner. The 3rd season of The Arrow will have some new characters and will sure add some new viewers as word of mouth spreads. I'll be sure to add season 2 of Arrow to my pre-order list as I already own the first season.",1407110400,,709,4.2592592592592595

5867198,3,B00DY64BLG,"I've been watching this show for a while now and I think it's time for a review.

The setting is this; millionaire playboy creates a second life for himself where he fights crime as a vigilante in an effort to rid his boyhood home from the crime syndicates that are now running the city. Sound familiar?? Well it should. I couldn't write this review without stating right up front that this show is almost shamelessly a clone of the Batman story line. I should state also that I've never read any of the original story line of The Green Arrow, so I'm not sure is the story always has been or if the amazing success of Christopher Nolan's Batman series made the produces want to clone it in a made for TV version or if it always has been and the creators of Arrow are simply staying true to its roots.

At any rate, think Batman but only slightly less well done without the topnotch acting and cheesier action sequences and you're pretty much there. Even so, I wouldn't consider all of this an insult exactly, even the best of superhero movies can't quite stack up to The Dark Knight. I actually find myself quite entertained by this one. Nothing in it stands out as being bad per se, only an obvious knockoff.

The acting is mediocre, but better than you might expect from a superhero TV show. The main character Stephen Amell playing Oliver Queen does a pretty decent job here, perhaps no Golden Globes for this one, but certainly no Razzie Award winner.

The story line moves forward while doing a pretty good job throwing a couple twists along the way, some less than shocking, but just enough to keep you from getting bored. I've seen enough of further seasons too know that things change for Olly, growing darker as he fights his most hated villains and compromising his morals blah blah blah. At this point I would probably keep watching more, when I find myself in the mood for it, but only because it's on Netflix and I'm running out of decent material there.

Conclusion
Overall I would say there are far worse shows to be watching, but there are quite a few better ones out there too. If you're in the mood for a superhero show and you're sick of re-watching all of the really good movies out there, like me, then check this one out and see if it's a fit for you, it won't have been a total waste of time.

5867258,5,B00DY64BLG,"I've been watching since the very first episode and this is definitely a good TV show that's gotten progressively better.  It's one of the best comic book adaptations made for TV.  I was a huge Smallville fan when that was on and I would put Arrow right up there with it.  The acting is good (especially by the lead, Stephen Amell and Emily Bett), the fight scenes are incredibly well choreographed and the writing is good as well.  This show is a must watch for me as I watch it live, no DVR and I typically put the phone and anything else down that might distract me so I won't miss anything.  I'm a bit of a fan girl when it comes to comic books/movies, etc so it's understandable that I'm hooked but my husband (who really could care less about comics) even likes this.  It's not too over the top or campy, it's just the perfect blend of all things awesome.  Definitely recommend if you're looking for a new show to tune into.  Don't let the fact that it's on the CW be a detractor (in my opinion, they tend to do comic book adaptations better than the big 3 any day).

I honestly don't have any gripes about any of the characters, and the plot lines are able to hold your attention throughout the season. Stephen Amell is perfect as ""The Arrow"", and David Ramsey as ""John Diggle"" and Emily Bett Rickards as ""Felicity Smoak"" complement his character very well. Even all of the love story plot lines don't get on my nerves as they usually do on other TV shows. I also like how this show is not scared to kill off major characters; it makes the pain seem all the more real and it actually makes you look with anticipation to see who will be killed off next. So all in all, great dialogue, great fight scenes, good humor, love, and good cliff hangers make this show a must see in my opinion.",1406160000,,860,4.415094339622642

5867494,3,B00DY64BLG,"I like the way this show continues its pace.  Decent fight scenes, beautiful actors, and hilarious one liners are the highlight of every episode.  The writing, the choreography, music, and lighting really add to the depth of feeling people have put into this series.

I'm a casual superhero fan and I grew out of the comics a while ago but what I remember were the story arcs were really, really dark.  There's a levity in the TV version that is welcoming.  I mean, anything having to do with R'as al Ghul or his family or anyone his family comes in contact with is a real downer, amirite?

I love how Oliver has his own Scooby gang, just like Buffy.  I don't like how Oliver has to sleep with (almost) every woman who walks across the screen.  Some of those hook-ups were a little mind boggling and head scratching.

I think the cutest characters are Felicity and DIg. The cons i have are primarily based in character development.

1.  Sarah turned out to be waaaay more interesting that her sister.
2.  Where is Oliver's real heart?  Who does it belong to?  We don't see his true heart for all this 2nd season. He might be comfortable in his skin now. He has hot passion/one night stands and he's got fuzzy friendships... unrealistic? Obviously.
3.  Felicity rocks but what is she?  His den mother?  Office wife? Ugh.  The coolest girl is ""friend-zoned.""
4.  Why can't anyone just die?  Does everyone get a free ""come back to life"" or ""get out of jail free"" card?  Are we running out of story line and villains?

I do like the series but it's got a lot of over-hashed repetitive themes.  I skip all scenes involving whiny Laurel, bitchy mom, and ""just slumming it"" Thea.  Snooze-fest.  Let's just move on to the head bashing, shall we?",1405382400,,1737,4.525806451612903

As a result, the storylines and pace have developed well-especially Arrow and Canary getting together.  There is however, one glaring error here-one that is easily correctible. Please, please, please! kill off Thea's boyfriend Roy.  His extinction would a be the best example ever of ""addition by subtraction"". He couldn't be more useless-I literally cringe when he's on-screen.

I'm hoping Oliver and Felicity will end up together! Overall, the show is really great. The acting isn't always amazing, especially in season 1, but everyone is getting better as the show progresses. It has a lot of great elements: humor, action, great plot and character development, as well as a sort of love story that that is not a main focal point of the show (I like that it is subtle, or else it would make Arrow too lovey-dovey, which it's a little too dark for, in my opinion).

5867729,5,B00DY64BLG,"NO SPOILERS so you are safe to read on.  I hate reading spoilers.

The best way I can describe this show is that you feel like you're watching how it would play out in the comic books.  Great dialog, action, great story telling.  I haven't watched a lot of ""Smallville"" but to me this is the best comic book television show of all time! Yes, I know some will bash me for saying that over the old ""Batman"" show with Adam West, but ""Arrow"" really is an awesome show.

I didn't start watching this until this season about half way through, so I started watching the first season and I was hooked within the first 5 minutes and just flew through the who first season and then started to get caught up with the 2nd.  Stephen Ameil does such a great job playing the lead character, my hope is for when they do a ""Justice League"" movie, that if Green Arrow is in this that Stephen gets the part.  Really good young actor.  The cast has a lot of newer or unknown actor's, there are a few I recognize from other small roles on other show's or a movie here and there but they all really work so well together.

I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves an action, mystery drama type show, watch this show and you won't be sorry.",1402963200,,1225,4.223175965665236

5867785,5,B00DY64BLG,"The CW's ARROW had a very auspicious start when it began in 2012. The first season seemed to be a mismash of BATMAN BEGINS (only with a lot more killing) and Sam Raimi's first SPIDER-MAN film in regards to the love triangle between Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell), Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy) and Tommy Merlyn (Colin Donnell), and how showrunner Greg Berlanti seemed to be determined to turn Tommy into the Harry Osborn character who would eventually take up arms against ""The Hood"" as his father Malcolm (the fantastic John Barrowman) did. Each episode counting down to the finale seemed to be leading in that direction until suddenly, the finale of the first season came, and it seemed like every cliched moment the show had displayed was suddenly turned on its head. The Undertaking wasn't able to be stopped, and although Moira Queen (Susanna Thompson) finally took responsibility for her part in it, and Malcolm was killed by Oliver, much of Starling City was left in ruins and our heroes watched as people they loved died. It was the ultimate television shocker; a show that was pretty good but not great... that actually ended its first season with the heroes winning the battles but losing the war. That was a really ballsy move on ARROW's part, and one that I had to applaud them for. Suddenly, I was very excited to where the second season would take us.

And the second season didn't disappoint at all.

This season really is about Ollie's three different families: his real family with mother Moira, sister Thea (Willa Holland), her boyfriend Roy (Colton Haynes), Laurel's dad and new Arrow fan club member Quentin (Paul Blackthorne); his crime-fighting family of Diggle (David Ramsey), Felicity (the great Emily Bett Rickards), and seemingly-resurrected Sara Lance (now played by Caity Lotz) as ""The Canary""; and his Purgatory island family of Slade Wilson (Manu Bennett), Shado (Celina Jade), as well as Sara and how they all intersect. After Oliver makes a fateful decision to save one of his island family members over the other from the hands of the severely morally-compromised Dr. Anthony Ivo (Dylan Neal) in his never-ending search for a super-serum called ""mirakuru"" (which Slade now has coursing through his veins, saving him from certain death but also slowly driving him insane), the island family is thrown into chaos which catches up with Oliver and his other two families in the here and now. Wilson arrives in Starling to not only destroy the city, but to take away everyone that Oliver cares about, leaving him as alone and agonized as he is. Another emerging threat to the city is Brother Blood aka Sebastian Blood (Kevin Alejandro), a seemingly forthright mayoral candidate who is also a lunatic bent on shaping Starling to his vision. Good will battle evil, and in some cases, team up with evil, and only one side can be victorious.

The pace this season kept is miles beyond what was started in the first season. Everything is better; the story, the character arcs (with the exception of poor Laurel, whose primary arc is little more than an afterschool special about the dangers of alcohol and drug addiction), the action, the interplay between characters, the big surprises (including another great character back from the dead), and the inclusion of many more DC Universe easter eggs, most especially being Grant Gustin appearing at the midpoint of the season to play Barry Allen, who fans of the comics will know as eventually becoming The Flash (whose appearance was so hyped that it gave ARROW its own un-official spin-off). This season also brought us Amanda Waller (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) and Task Force X (aka The Suicide Squad), as well as Nyssa Al Ghul (Katrina Law, another veteran of the great cable series SPARTACUS like Bennett and Addai-Robinson) and the League of Assassins. If this weren't a 22-episode season, all this might have seemed like a bit much, but these are characters that absolutely end up benefitting this show. It also introduces Isabel Rochev, a possible ally/love-interest/villain in the personage of Summer Glau, who is an actress I love to see work, but her presence seems to doom some really good to excellent shows (see FIREFLY, THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, THE UNIT, DOLLHOUSE, and ALPHAS).

While it's obviously Amell's show, and it lives and dies by his blend of guilt, charisma, physical prowess, and gravitas, this season firmly belongs to Bennett as Slade Wilson. He's a much deadlier threat than that of Malcolm Merlyn (despite how much I love John Barrowman), and his performance never rings false for a moment. A hero is pretty much only as good as his villains, and while this season has plenty to spare, no one comes close to the imposing presence of Bennett, who is truly remarkable.

ARROW is obviously a much different show than the CW's superheroic prequel series SMALLVILLE, but they're both following very similar dynamics. If you look at the two, structure-wise, they're very similar even down to the beautiful nerdy girl who's constantly friend-zoned by the man she obviously loves (which eerily enough ends up being Oliver Queen in both shows!), but ARROW is confident to take a darker path with a more down-to-earth hero, and gives more opportunities to make an even more solid ensemble than SMALLVILLE did.",1402704000,,5299,4.9695603156708
5867786,5,B00DY64BLG,Outstanding storyline and great acting performing of the stunts. Very surreal. I can't remember another series without big name stars that was as compelling as Arrow has been.,1402704000,,175,5.285714285714286

5867788,4,B00DY64BLG,"I avoided watching Arrow at all for a while. I had seen enough to know that this wasn't the Green Arrow I remembered from the comics, but rather a Batman show with the names and costumes changed. But in a moment of boredom, I started Season One on Netflix and--after a few episodes--told my girlfriend that we had to watch this. I described it her by saying ""It's like 'Revenge' (a show she watches) and Batman had a baby."" We haven't looked back. After finishing up Season One on Netflix, we told ourselves we would wait until we could get Season 2 for free, but--well, now we own Season 2 and are 6 or 7 episodes in within less than a week.

5867978,4,B00DY64BLG,"I love this show!  Some things do annoy me this season but I'm blinded by how much I like it. So yes this review is biased but I can admit I prefer season one. (PARTIAL SPOILER!?) Two other slight dislikes are ""no more killing"" he was such a bad ass when he always went straight for the kill but I appreciate the character progression. The other thing that bothers me is ""permanence"" in the storyline arcs but it's the same in comics so I can't be too upset. There is no such thing as something that cannot be changed or undone by a weak story twist the problem  being the more ""undo's "" you have the less emotionally attached The viewer is when you attempt a big shock/tragedy. I enjoy the difference from the show to all versions of the comics and love what they do with ""Red Arrow"". All things considered if you loved season one as much as I did that carries you through and still makes you consider taking up archery because of an awesome character portrayal by Stephen Amell.",1401062400,,980,4.3497267759562845

I'm looking forward to the next season. The actors/actresses are great and deliver their characters in a way that make you love/hate them. I highly recommend this show to anyone who I a fan of action/drama/superheroes. You won't be dissapointed.,1400976000,,393,4.549295774647887

If you are a fan of action and adventure this show is for you.  I was not familiar with the comic book story, but you don't have to be to enjoy this program.  Stories are excellent, photography, direction, costumes, writing, acting everything is top notch.  Can't wait for Season 3!",1400889600,,439,4.506329113924051

5868042,3,B00DY64BLG,"My young son and I have been watching this show for some time, but it seems like the characters are going to bed with each other every other episode, with both homosexual and heterosexual themes. Not appropriate for a superhero show, which by its very nature targets kids. Can't there be at least one action show on television where sex isn't elevated as the ultimate goal of humanity?",1400803200,4,385,4.676470588235294

5868063,3,B00DY64BLG,"One thing that especially annoyed me about this show was the nosy insecure computer-tech girl with the blonde hair. She was BEYOND annoying. Always worrying about who ""The Arrow"" was having sex with. Like ""Hey! Mind your own damn biz & stop worrying about where that man sticks his *bleep*!"" It's like she took it as a direct insult when he slept with the chick who attempted the hostile take over. Every time ""The Arrow"" is telling a story about the HELL he went through on that island, all she comments on was the fact that there was a ""woman"" involved in the situation. Always with the snide comments making light of the pure HELL that poor man went through on that island. Like ""B***h are you kidding me!?"" I have no idea why the writers tried to make this a ""thing"". One occurrence, fine. But a constant during every damn episode!? NO!

The younger sister (Thea) is an annoying brat. It irked me every time she came on camera. I had to F.F. most of the time, cuz I got tired of hearing a so-called ""teen"" talkin 'ish with her face all up in the ""adults"" face with her arms crossed like she pays the bills up in there *lol* and with that shiny nasty wart on her lip. Oh and what 17-18 yr old is legally allowed to run a ""night club"" ? Especially one that has a history of substance abuse. Also they really need to fix her wardrobe, someone who's built like a 12 y/o boy shouldn't be wearing a Bodycon dress. Which she seems to wear in every. scene.

Also REALLY not a fan of the genital wart both the daughter & mother have on their top lip. I'm sure they're moles but MAN it did not look like it. Was very distracting.

I was into it at first, it was something I watched while traveling or folding laundry. I watched up until the current episodes. Then I guess I lost interested, because every time I got the notification that new episodes were available I was like ""Meh...I'll watch it later"" (Unlike my faves ""Hannibal, Orphan Black & Supernatural, etc"" where I can't wait to watch what happens next). Well it's been 10 episodes later and I still haven't watched. So I will be calling Amazon customer service asking for a refund for episode not watched.

DISCLAIMER: Being that Amazon ""comments section"" is becoming too much like YouTube comments due to ignorant people with no lives, I have to make this disclaimer. F_ _ _ YOU in advance to anyone that feels the need to criticize my review, as well other peoples review. I turned the ""notification"" feature off because I couldn't careless about anyone's feedback. So your stupid commentary WILL fall on deaf ears. So STFU in advance also. Have a good one : )",1400716800,,2617,4.4345114345114345

5868066,5,B00DY64BLG,I'm not really a comic book fan and I knew nothing of the arrow before watching this show but this was really a fun show.

5868195,5,B00DY64BLG,"This is a series that I originally decided to stay away from because it was on the CW,  you know...the network that brought you ""The Vampire Diaries"".  Sorry ""Diaries"" fans but I just cannot get into your favorite series.  Anyway, back to the subject.  I take back everything I said about the CW network, well almost everything...ARROW is exceptionally good.  It has big screen qualities that are not usually found on the smaller screens (although 80"" is not so small).  Expertly choreographed action sequences, good stories and some fine acting make this series a pleasant surprise.  I'm all in and I've only watched a portion of the first season.  Good casting for the series lead, Stephen Amell and David Ramsey as his ""sidekick"" John Diggle.  I guess I'll be purchasing the second season from Amazon so I can catch up.  Good job, CW, even if you do produce ""Vampire Diaries"".  I'll probably be driven out of town after my thumbs down for ""Diaries"".  They shoot the series in the county I live in.

5868199,5,B00DY64BLG,"This is one of the best shows I've ever seen. The writing is amazing. In season 2, the episodes leave you constantly engaged. The last few episodes feel like a collection of finales - that's how good each one was. I highly recommend watching this show. You won't be disappointed in its ability to entertain you.",1400371200,,311,4.571428571428571
5868220,5,B00DY64BLG,"With the way they ended the first season of Arrow, I really thought it was going to be a single-season show. (Apparently they did, too!)

Having just finished the full Season 2 last night, I can't even begin to do it the justice it deserves, aside from saying that it is far better even than Season 1!

If you're a super hero junkie like me, you'll love this Season of Arrow! And, if you haven't given Arrow a try at all yet, do yourself a favor and purchase the first and second seasons and make a weekend marathon of it! (Yep - it's ""that"" addictive!)",1400371200,,553,4.257142857142857

5868224,5,B00DY64BLG,I got into the show by the recommendation of a friend. Now my only complaint is they don't come out fast enough. I'm not usually a fan of a show with excessive flash backs but I like that this show keeps the flashbacks in chronological order. Makes it much easier to follow. Arrow's second season was full of action adventure and (almost surprisingly) a great plot played out by a fantastic cast.,1400284800,,396,4.513888888888889

People die that are integral to the plot and shows that ""real life"" isn't always a fairy tale. Great casting, great sound, great everything. The only thing that continues to get to me is the Canary's mouth gestures. She is trying to hard to be coy and cute. I can't tell if she is doing it to try and conceal her real voice or what.

5868315,3,B00DY64BLG,Seems to be struggling to find a steady plot now. Why didn't the writers get through the island story a little sooner. Maybe they think it ties the story together by writing it this way.,1399939200,2,186,4.3428571428571425
5868316,5,B00DY64BLG,Definitely one of the best super hero shows. Gotta love the angst! The characters are very complex. It's worth watching!,1399939200,,120,5.05

5868318,5,B00DY64BLG,"Arrow probably has the best action scenes of any television show.  Each character is interesting and has a vital role to the overall success of the series and storyline.  If I have any complaint, it would be they mayhem caused by Slade.  They are dragging it out over too many episodes.......in my opinion.",1399852800,,306,4.735849056603773

5868340,4,B00DY64BLG,"I believe this program is based on a comic book character which I am not familiar with but this series is action packed to say the least.  I like the depth they go into the characters and the scenery is great.  Sometimes the story line seems to be interrupted with too many flashbacks, but I have to admit they do fill-in the blanks of validating the actions the characters are taking in the present day.  The actors and actresses have a good handle on reflecting emotions which make the characters believable.  I would recommend that if you are into good versus evil and hero's and villains, you may like this series.",1399852800,,618,4.54054054054054

5868391,4,B00DY64BLG,"While comics/graphic novels are always the best way to go when it comes to ""Superhero"" material, this show does have its pros and cons. First it is 10000x better than that nonsense Smallville. It keeps you interested and wanting more every episode into each season. I was hoping for a little more in season 2 than I am seeing, but maybe because season 1 was just that damn good. The fighting is more like dancing and kind of cheesy at times. Oliver has more of Batman's/Bruce Wayne's personality than he does Oliver Queens true personality, and the character's aside from Deathstroke and Barry Allen seem to be missing something...hmm. Maybe more story, maybe more costume? Maybe I'm just used to reading about these characters and ""Hollywood"" tends to kill everything it touches. Nonetheless, the story and plot are rich and full of woe. It is definitely something to sit down and watch if you haven't already.",1399680000,,911,4.846153846153846

5868396,2,B00DY64BLG,"The first season of Arrow was quite enjoyable.  This second season is, in a word, silly.  It's like a bad daytime soap opera in which one episode completely reverses the premise of the episode that came before it, often for no apparent reason.  It's almost like there are two competing teams of screen writers who write every other episode and then try to undo whatever the other team did.  This is most egregiously notable in the way that nobody stays dead.  Now, admittedly, this is fairly common, but the usual rule is that any character who dies off camera is only ""mostly dead"".  However, when you have (spoiler alert) two separate people who more or less died on camera, including one who was killed by the Arrow's bare hands, you have to wonder.
  Net result: quit with the first season and then hope that the Flash spinoff is better.",1399593600,5,841,4.597315436241611
5868397,2,B00DY64BLG,"I really enjoyed the first season of Arrow. I am not a huge fan of comic book genre, but there has been some excellent development of this genre in recent years. The first season of Arrow was a great example. The characters in this series are a great blend of the two dimensional comic book super hero characters mixed with multi-layered character issues and development. This creates a fun and exciting super hero series that also draws the viewer into the struggles of the characters. There are successes and failures for both the good guys and the bad guys, but the hero moves forward in his quest to right the wrongs his family has done and save his city.  He puts his super abilities to work to accomplish his goal and achieves successes and failures, but generally moves forward in his goal. The first season did an excellent job of setting up this very interesting multi-layered comic book drama. The viewer is able to see the emotional/psychological growth in the hero throughout the first season. Very nicely woven in to each episode are enlightening flashbacks that reveal a bit of the hero's history and what shaped him into the super-hero he is today. The first season was a great balance of the comic book super hero world, good character development and exciting multi-layered drama.

After this promising start, the second season has been a disappointment. The character development of the hero/good guy characters is all over the place and it seems that the characters have lost much of the ground gained in season one. There are no wins for the hero and his team this season, which makes watching this series more depressing each week. It seems that our ""super hero"" can't even help a grandma across the street, much less tackle the behemoth bad guy that is taking over his city. The bad guy and his cohorts are unstoppable while the hero and his ever expanding team seem to not even be able to tie their shoes.

The super bad guy this season is excellent, and the back story development in season two is very well done (probably because it is helping us understand the relationship between the bad guy and our hero). However, it is too bad the writers didn't balance this excellent bad guy development with at least a little bit of good guy development. There have been some good set-ups for potential developments which mostly end up as missed opportunities for some excellent small wins and additional character growth on the hero side. The viewer needs at least a few of these moments to bring us a glimpse of the contrast between good and evil which is (I believe) at the heart of a good comic book hero series. Slipping a few of these in would at least have the viewer rooting for the hero instead of leaving the viewer feeling deflated at the end of each episode (unless you are rooting for the bad guy). The bad guy seems to be the only one with any ability to follow through on his plans and goals. There is one episode left in season two. I suppose one could hope that the depressing first 22 episodes could be resolved in one week, but I'm not holding my breath. And if everything is resolved in the final week, it will be the cap on the inconsistent story line and character development of the hero in this second season.

While I was disappointed with season two, if this series makes it to season three I may watch the first few episodes. There is much to appreciate about this series (generally), and I do hope that perhaps the next season (if there is one) could do a better job of balancing the good/evil story lines, as they did in the first season.",1399593600,8,3584,4.577881619937695

The actors are much better at their craft that what you see on Heroes or Agents of Shield. This is a show where the characters themselves are more important and enjoyable than the fight scenes. Don't worry, it has enough comic book references for the dedicated fan and there is a lot of action.

5868488,5,B00DY64BLG,"Great show even if you were not Green Arrow fan like me.  Acting is very good overall.  So many times the characters in these type of shows are not fully developed.  With this series you really do see the characters grow and develop.  It is definitely best to watch shows in order not so much for current story, but more for background while Oliver was missing and considered dead for 5 years.  Subscribing to season 2 thru Amazon was not only best value it is very handy because I travel a lot and can watch on Fire, iPod, roku etc.",1399248000,,533,4.29

5868579,5,B00DY64BLG,"I'm usually turned off by any series under the CW banner, and most super hero shows for that matter, but I take great exception to this one. The story line is great, and the occasional time jumps give you something extra to consider as you're trying to piece things together. The production quality and the acting are all pretty solid. Some of the more seasoned actors come from some of my favorite shows of the past, which is a special treat. The story has taken us on a wild journey over the past 40+ episodes I've seen, and you can see the struggle and humanity everyone faces on a weekly basis, including the lead character, Oliver Queen. He's not perfect, and frequently makes mistakes, but he seems to be learning from them and evolving into a new version of himself with each season. Other shows have frequent gimmicky and cheesy moments where you're almost too embarrassed to watch (or even admit that you watch) but I haven't come across this with Arrow. Some of the episodes even take me by surprise. I highly recommend this show to anyone, whether they like super hero shows or not. A bit too violent and adult for children though, so keep that in mind.",1398729600,,1164,4.5476190476190474

5868582,5,B00DY64BLG,I did not know much about the green arrow comics as I knew about green lantern but green arrow has become my second favorite dc comics character after superman. This show is amazing. It takes that dark Christopher Nolan approach into a modern day series. It is not your typical good clean cut PG superhero like smallville. The arrow kills and has a dark past and is tempted daily by that dark side. This show provides everything you need in a modern day superhero series. The cast was chosen perfectly except for maybe Roy who annoys me often but other than that the characters have great chemistry. The plot and story line keeps you on your feet and wanting more every week. This show is well put together and better than anything and I mean anything out there.

Strong character development and some great action.  Like Batman in a lot of ways but less ""heavy"" and at the end of the day a lot more enjoyable.",1398556800,,309,4.685185185185185

5868645,3,B00DY64BLG,"Like a soap opera with people coming back from the dead. Is satisfying to see really bad guys getting killed. This is absent in this season. It's like the PC police came after the show and said he couldn't really be a vigilante. Progress never seems to be made in cleaning up the city. When one bad guy is put away, another fills his shoes intead of there being a different problem elsewhere to solve.

It just lacks the creativity in writing to bring back dead characters and replace one bad guy with another.",1398470400,2,510,4.425531914893617

Leave it to House of Cards and such shows where it would make sense.  besides that one sour note which like I said would play well in a different show, this is a good fun show with lots of twists and turns.

5868669,2,B00DY64BLG,"Arrow is based on a cartoon so you expect the characters to be ""super-human-like.""  However, Arrow has gone too far in the second Season by introducing Slate as the mortal enemy of Oliver due to the death of Shadow.  Slate was a character you liked on the island and still want to like him in the city.  You can't have the shows villain be a character the audience likes and have the basis for his being a villain be so weak (i.e., Oliver killed the love his life).  In season one Oliver and Slate were ""brothers"" and Oliver, Slate, and Shadow were like the Three Musketeers.  Now one of the Musketeers has tortured the other due to the death of the third Musketeer at the hands of their enemy.  Enough Arrow for me.

5868676,4,B00DY64BLG,"Season 2 of Arrow has been an example of great growth of an already fun show. We see much growth in Oliver as he learns to accept help from his friends and realize that he can accomplish his goals without killing. There are fun reveals in terms of new characters including The Flash. If I had one complaint it would be the continued presence of Laurel. Her character seems to be off on its own, having nothing much to do with the Arrow storyline. Katie Cassidy does a great job of portraying Laurel's spiral into darkness, but it would have been nice to see her more connected to the other characters and the main storyline.",1398124800,,624,4.434782608695652

My only dislike and 4 stars is because it's the same problem I had with the first, I just don't like seeing all the sexual interactions and parts with like everyone,:( it's just so not important for the show to me. If it didn't having all that I would definitely give it a five star, but since it does that's my reason for giving it only a 4 star rating. But besides all that I really enjoyed this season it was even more interesting and kept me even more intrigued through every episode.

The premise of the story line caught my attention and I thought that I would give it a shot figuring after two or more episodes I would quickly lose interest and move on to something else.  I really like this series!  The story line weaves a captivating tapestry of what has happened to Oliver Queen and the rest of the characters in the past to how each of them will react to the many challenges that they face.  New flashbacks in each episode clarify why the Arrow is so complex and what has molded him into the person that he is.  This season ends with Olivers world seemingly to have crashed down around him.

can't wait to see how he responds.",1397520000,,765,4.277777777777778

5868848,5,B00DY64BLG,I must admit it took me a long time to convince myself to watch Arrow because I thought it would just be another Super Hero night time soap opera but to my delight and amazement it was so good that I watched weekly programs back to back and did not want to stop.  The main character is imperfect which makes it believable and the supporting characters are great!,1397433600,,362,4.323529411764706

5868893,5,B00DY64BLG,"Arrow is one of the best shows on TV. The story is compelling, the characters have depth, and the quality of production and special effects is stellar. If you are looking for slow paced stories or comedy this may not be for you. If, on the other hand, you want action and intrigue, you won't regret watching Arrow. Honestly, I did not have great hopes for the show but thought I'd watch a few episodes because I'd enjoyed the Green Arrow character on Smallville. But after one episode I was hooked. Oliver Queen is a flawed character and that is what makes him interesting. There are no perfect people on Arrow, and everyone has secrets. Rough if that's what your real life is like, but very nice to watch in a program like Arrow. Can't wait to see what is coming next.",1397433600,,769,4.422535211267606

5868898,4,B00DY64BLG,Good mystery.  Entertaining.  Reasonably good acting.  I would recommend for light entertainment.  It is a good story.  Enjoyed it.  Yes.,1397260800,,137,5.6

5868940,4,B00DY64BLG,"I have never been a big super hero fan.  However, I do like this show very much.  The Story line is believable and action is fantastic.  It keeps me very intrigued with the switching between the Island the Glades and  Starling City that Ollie is trying to save.  Then on top of that you have such wonderful love stories with Ollie and Laurel, Roy and  Leah and of course Mrs Queen and her soon to be EX.  The villains even keep you guessing with Mr Merlot and now the Aldermen being part of the Black Guards what is up with that so interesting.  Now we are at the stage where we find out about Sara the sister he suppose to have died and super hero formula.  I am only have way through but I really enjoy the suspense.  I am watching it slowly so I can keep track of all the twists. turns and plots.  I know I only gave it a four but that is because some of the bad guys that Ollie fights are kind of lame.  Diggle and Felecity really give Ollie an edge just like a good man needs a good women, a good super hero needs backup.  just watch the series",1397088000,,1049,4.033980582524272

Slade Wilson is a great addition to this show and I like how even though she's dead they have brought Shadow back. Great chemistry in all the action. If they keep writing episodes this well, this show will last a long time like Smallville. I love how they bring back actors from Smallville, Srargate, and film down the street were Duncan MacCloud lived. America is losing out on lot of great shows to Vancouver BC.",1397088000,,530,4.363636363636363

5868945,3,B00DY64BLG,"When Arrow first came out, I loved it.  For whatever reason, this second season just falls flat for me. Laurel started out as a super strong lady and is now in a typical 'chick' roll that bores me. Sarah is bi-sexual? REALLY what purpose did THAT serve? Moria Queen killer of hundreds running for office? Lame!

John Diggle and Felicity are the only two characters this season that seem to be growing and are enjoyable to me. I'm going to watch the rest of this season and decide then if I'll go with season 3.",1397088000,2,510,4.3578947368421055

Easily one of the best shows to binge watch if you have the time!  Compared to the First Season of Arrow, I would say that the second season has greatly improved.  More action, more drama, and of course even more references to the greater DC Universe.",1397088000,,414,4.269230769230769

5868974,5,B00DY64BLG,I love this show and I hope that it is not taken off any time soon! I gave it a five star rating because I think with the story line and action that it deserves it. The characters are amazing and the actors and actresses do a wonderful job.,1396828800,,240,3.9183673469387754
5868975,4,B00DY64BLG,I am pleasently suprised and throughly enjoy the series which is much better than I thought it was going to be. Character development is good. I enjoy how they introduced Flash or pre-Flash and the league of assassins. I like how Arrow changed form an angent of vengence to a Hero for the whole of Starling city. Also I enjoyed how he went from a lone maverick to developing a team although some members where unexpected. I really enjoy Diggle and he is my favorite character.,1396828800,,476,4.546511627906977

5868977,5,B00DY64BLG,"Arrow has really kept the quality up.  I will say that it may be time to wrap up the Slade storyline, which is statring to drag a bit.  Develop the Roy character more and that partnership while bringing in new villains.",1396828800,,219,4.317073170731708
5868978,2,B00DY64BLG,"The series has a lot potential, but it's starting to feel like a soap opera action series. The arrow is also often portrayed as stumbling through one conflict after another, never completely able to handle the conflicts on his own or even with the help of his team.

5869098,5,B00DY64BLG,"My husband and I stumbled onto this series and we never dreamed that it would hit so close to home. My husband is a retired Marine Corps officer with 23 years of career wartime. Being a mustang and becoming an officer gave him more incite into real war
time events and helped him teach his young Marines how to survive. He did not give up after retirement but started coaching football and teaching high school Special Education. Many of the young people in his classes could very well be from the Glades.
His career in the Marines helps him teach the discipline that these students lack in their home environment. He teaches them what the real world is like and how to survive in it. For many of them he is the last step before entering life. Some of them are still going to make bad choices or cannot survive on their own and they may end up in prison or worse. For all of them they are given guidance and a choice while they are in school. There is a law in Ameicanow that states ""No child left behind"" so there are ways for the students to get help and even further their education. There are trade schools and work programs. The main thing is they can get a high school diploma. Without that their chances are slim. I halfway expect to see some episodes about this very thing in the Glades as it begins to rebuild.
Being a Real Estate Broker I can understand the evil developer's mad plan to destroy the slums and rebuild there. My specialty was new construction and I worked for a developer for five years and studied Planned Urban Development from the ground up.
So you can understand how this series hits home for both of us. That Goodness for the Arrow. He is as close to a real life Super Hero as it gets.
Best wishes for your efforts in this series and we will both be with you until the end which we hope will be many years from now.",1396310400,,1845,4.289398280802292

5869137,5,B00DY64BLG,Excellent story and execution. this is how i would picture a real super hero in real life. Hope it will continue with more seasons.,1396137600,,131,4.5
5869138,5,B00DY64BLG,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the second season so far.  Suspenseful, action packed, and love the dialogue.  Lots of chemistry with the cast.",1396137600,,137,5.181818181818182
5869169,4,B00DY64BLG,"I should start by saying that, while I love action and science fiction, I am not a huge comic fan and I don't care at all whether Arrow the TV show strictly adheres to the canon of the DC comic.  Folks concerned about fidelity with Oliver Queen on the page may want to flip this review 180 degrees because I think the show is at its best when it isn't trying to match the DC comic.

Precisely because I'm not a comic fan, I didn't give Arrow a chance when it first came out.  When I finally caught the pilot via streaming I was hooked and binge-watched my way through Season 1 and as much of Season 2 as is available.  The primary reason is that Stephen Amell is just really good as Oliver Queen/The Arrow.  In addition to the requisite good looks and athleticism, Amell brings a controlled intensity that grabs your attention and makes the ""hero with a secret identity, wresting inner demons"" story feel believable.  Amell portrays two Olivers - the younger, self-centered boy who sneaked off on the family yacht with his girlfriend's sister, and the hardened, driven man who returns years later to Starling City after being marooned and presumed dead.  Current-day Oliver has many secrets and Amell effectively uses facial expression as much as words to let us in on Oliver's thoughts.

As the two founding members of Team Arrow, John Diggle (David Ramsey) and Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards) are equally as good.  The relationship between Oliver, Digg and Felicity feels genuine; they spend a lot of time together and we see them bicker and tease, but ultimately support one another when it matters most.  Rickard's role has grown over time, a smart move on the part of the creators.  As Felicity, she manages to be simultaneously naive, awkward, brilliant and beautiful and she provides most of the show's humor.  Oliver and Felicity are not a couple, but Amell and Rickards have a crazy good chemistry that makes them more compelling than many TV romantic pairings.  If for no other reason, you should catch early Season 2 just to watch Oliver watch Felicity.

So why not 5 stars?  Because, after a great start, the show feels like it's coming unglued in the second half of Season 2.  Perhaps in order to cater to the comic fans, they've introduced a plethora of DC heroes and villains, and Oliver may as well have posted his secret identity on Facebook.  Team Arrow feels crowded now and we don't get enough time with any one character, including Oliver, to really care about him/her.  In focusing chiefly on the action/fight scenes, the show has lost much of what made it fun -- watching Oliver try to balance his day job as a CEO with his night job as The Arrow, and seeing the trio of Oliver, Digg and Felicity work together both in the office and in their hide-out.  Season 1 also gave us a more focused villain storyline, with John Barrowman doing a great job as the Dark Archer.  Season 2 has introduced a lot of dangling plot threads.

Other than Felicity and Oliver's mother, Moira, the show has also struggled all along with its female characters.  There is an abundance of beauties with doe-eyes and overbites (Laurel, Isabel, Sara, Thea) who are not bright, not convincing, and not even very interesting.  Laurel really doesn't work as the object of Oliver's long-time devotion.  The show keeps trying to portray her as a tough, intelligent attorney, but it always falls apart and she succeeds mainly in appearing teary and resentful.  As Oliver's competition in the boardroom, Isabel's girlish lisp does not sell her as a titan of business.  And even Sara (aka The Canary), for all her mad fighting skills, is bland.  She is Oliver without the intellect and angst and, as a couple, they are a little boring.  If the entire show had been content to remain a 2D comic book, the flat characters might not be so noticeable.  But Oliver, Digg and Felicity have done such a good job of becoming real, complex people that anything less from the others is disappointing.  And why thumb your nose at the TV gods by wasting the Oliver/Felicity chemistry?

So, if you've never watched the show, my recommendation is to grab Season 1 and the first dozen or so episodes of Season 2 and enjoy the ride.  The jury is still out on the rest of Season 2.",1396137600,,4259,4.644859813084112

5869379,4,B00DY64BLG,"Loved the first season. Was looking forward to the second season and the new wrinkles in the equation. Recognized some story and plot inconsistencies with the Green Arrow character in the DC Universe, but minor. Didn't expect Slade Wilson to be back. Totally unexpected and, I think, unnecessary. Sure, lots of things happened for 5 years in the island, but let's move on now to the present day and let the dead remain dead. Was looking more towards encounters with the League of Assassins, but I guess the script writers like nothing more than staying on in the island.",1395187200,,570,4.767676767676767

5869384,4,B00DY64BLG,I enjoy a good story line based on righting wrongs and the good looking bad gone good in secret. It's the usual family of rich and famous who are doing behind scene manipulation of government with the idea they know best. Always one rich group being blackmailed into line by the big leader who seems nice but is pure evil. Great archery type fight scenes and protagonist is nice to watch.,1395100800,,388,4.47887323943662

5869386,4,B00DY64BLG,"I enjoyed the first season enough to pay Amazon to watch the second. I know virtually nothing about the comic book character, so I'm just watching it for itself. It includes subtitles, and that's important to me.",1395100800,,212,4.756756756756757

5869429,4,B00DY64BLG,"I have been enjoying the second season of Arrow, however I must say the first season was better.  By this point you have gotten to know the characters pretty well, however some new ones are introduced, and the continuation of the back-story on the island helps to keep things interesting.
There are two primary bad guys, however one quickly drops off in importance without any reasonable explanation which I found a little frustrating.  He is about to take the city by storm in the mayoral election, and is a dominating figure in many of the first few episodes.  However once the second nemesis comes more into play, the original drops into the background.
Other than this it is an interesting story, and it is great to see all the primary characters develop, and to see some of new ones also take a frontal role in the series.",1395014400,,827,4.612244897959184
5869430,5,B00DY64BLG,"For a show on a small network, this is quality television. Plenty of action, drama, romance and some light comical moments to give it a little of everything. This is an excellent cast complimenting a very well written program. I hope it continues for a long time.",1394928000,,263,4.617021276595745
5869431,5,B00DY64BLG,"This show is totally awesome!  I love the way they show it from present day, while providing flashbacks of when Ollie was marooned on the island.  It gives backstory and reminds me of Once Upon A Time",1394928000,,200,4.378378378378378

5869434,5,B00DY64BLG,My husband and I both love this series and we have very different taste at times. This is the best super hero/comic type of show out there! Looking forward to many more episodes. Beware it is very addictive! ;),1394755200,,210,4.410256410256411
5869435,2,B00DY64BLG,"What happened?  Arrow used to be exciting, surprising and fast moving.  Then the writers ran out of ideas.  Now it's soapy, slow and the action has become totally predictable...sorry guys.",1394755200,4,188,5.2
5869436,5,B00DY64BLG,It is very good and I think that this show should always be on during the week and more episodes should be created with all the characters,1394755200,,138,4.148148148148148
5869437,5,B00DY64BLG,Well put together show.  From the beginning you can tell the writers have worked hard to develop the script and the actors perfecting their characters,1394755200,,150,5.0
5869448,5,B00DY64BLG,"Arrow is head and shoulders above the other efforts that have been put forth to translate the box-office success of superhero movies to the small screen. I had assumed that ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" was going to be better, but ended up instead falling in love with ""Arrow"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"" much. much more.

Arrow works because of excellent casting, a multi-layered approach to storytelling, complex and satisfying interactions among the characters, and a sophisticated moral landscape. It also has the best fight scenes ever choreographed for television, and a lead who is an amazing physical presence (but perhaps spends a too-pandery amount of time shirtless).

This is an addictively satisfying series that actually feels like a well-conceived story arc rather than merely a ""crisis of the week"" set of barely connected episodes, and give or tak the clunky bit of soap opera dialog, is among the most entertaining shows now being produced.",1394755200,,954,5.228758169934641
5869449,4,B00DY64BLG,"I enjoy the show. Most of the characters are likeable and you want to root for them. The romantic triangles get boring, but it's hard to find a show without it. I've enjoyed the evolution of ""Arrow"" from season 1 to season 2.",1394755200,,225,4.255813953488372
5869450,3,B00DY64BLG,"I got into this series after a marathon watching of the 1st season on Netflix.  I enjoyed it enough to pay for the 2nd season.  While the progression of the story arc's has been going okay, dropping of an initial arc from the start of the season, the failure to develop the partnership of Ollie/Arrow and Roy/Speedy more, and no hint of Hal Jordan (Ollie's best and oldest ""superhero"" friend) is a disappointment.
The writers and producers also reveal they have a problem with a growing cast.  If they find a way to balance them all and don't leave any more hanging plot lines this show could easily make it 5+ seasons.
One plus is all the lovely female cast members.  Especially their take on Black Canary.",1394755200,,707,4.543307086614173

5869455,5,B00DY64BLG,"This is easily one of the best shows on TV. Cast is spot on, story never gets boring , not even for a second. The acting is phenomenal, you truly get absorbed into the show and feel what the actors/actresses feel and the action is easily one of the best I've seen in regards of it's intensity and stunts. In fact I'd put this above other super hero movies. It deserves to be a movie. But I'm also grateful it isn't, because we wouldn't get all of this amazing story that keeps getting better. This is a must buy, but BE SURE to watch this show from season 1 ep. 1. You need to watch them all in order to appreciate it. And lastly, spend the extra buck to get HD, it's more then with it.",1394668800,,686,4.051470588235294

I got entranced right from the first scene and they haven't lost me since.  Great characters, two great adventures in one, and a hero that is great eye candy, especially in leather.  Great action, smart people, good plots.  Even love the dark videography.  One lush set in a mansion to lots of dark alleys and wet basements.  The best of comics come to life.  Can't wait for each episode to come from Amazon.",1394582400,,518,4.333333333333333
5869556,5,B00DY64BLG,This is a great series I would recommend to any action or comic book loving person. The drama and suspense give it just the right touch!  May not be suitable for children as my son (age 9) finds the violence (inherent to this type of show) to be too scary. Try an episode from season 1 and I guarantee it will be an instant favorite.,1394582400,,333,4.123076923076923

5869608,4,B00DY64BLG,"It's what you want, or at least what I want in a tv show adapted from a comic.  There's backstory, table setting, and the occasional bad guy from the comics, but it's setting the story the right way.  If they had started with the bad guy of the week approach, this show would've failed.  Instead, there's been a slow introduction, great character development, and I actually care what happens to the fictional people on the show, which is key for me.  Years ago, explosions and carnage would've been enough, but I like the telling of a story, and the story is a good one here.",1394409600,,576,4.457142857142857

5869616,5,B00DY64BLG,"I just flew through Arrow Season 1 and fell in love. It usually takes a show quite some time to get up to speed. This show not only worked from the start, it has one of the better ensemble casts on television. In particular the fact that you're essentially watching two shows at the same time as you're watching what happened to Oliver Queen while he was lost on an island and now that he's back. It is evident that the team behind the show fleshed out a multi-year story arc and that's exactly what a show needs to succeed. Usually when a show gets a chance and becomes a hit they then have to figure out how to keep going in the second season.

Beyond that, this show has the same vibe as the Christopher Nolan Batman series (serious, done as if it's in the real world, etc.). But unlike the Dark Knight trilogy which Nolan created completely separate from the DC universe, this show swims in the DC world. There are so many references it's hard to keep track as nearly episode has a villain or reference to a hero. They've introduced Barry Allen and now a Flash pilot is being filmed. If you love DC characters and want to see a show that is smart, sexy, kicks ass and treats the source material with respect - get into Arrow.",1394323200,,1229,4.297413793103448

Very few shows will do that to me.  I'm only half way through season 2 and I'm going mad with a week of waiting between episodes.
Most Frustrating of all is the ""love interests"" of Queen.  He seems to have many yet there is one he is obviously drawn to and very protective of...his geeky, awkward, girl next door cute, I.T. sidekick.  All the other women he's with are strong, beautiful, independent types.  They're women he's had and lost, and survived through it.  While his sidekick Felicity is smart and strong in her own way, the show makes you believe he keeps his distance romantically because she is the one he can't lose.

5869962,5,B00DY64BLG,"The second season is even better than the first. Felicity is awesome and so is Roy Harper. The only annoying part about the second season is that Laural is terrible...literally, all she does is sit on the couch, drinking wine, and moping about how everyone doesn't design their life to best suit her. I'm serious, in pretty much every scene after the first few episodes, she's sitting on a couch like a whiny teenager. So annoying and so useless, especially compared to the first season were she actually did things other than be an alcoholic.",1393459200,,543,4.726315789473684

It does a good job of maintaining a higher level story arch over the course of a season, but suffers from the monster of the week phenomena and frequently tries to cram every character possible into every episode with somewhat mixed results. There are too many characters on the show that they are attempting to develop story lines for and the overall product suffers somewhat.",1393459200,,493,4.744186046511628

5870071,5,B00DY64BLG,"This show has nearly convinced me to go out and buy some Green Arrow comic books.

There seems to be some real effort in making the storyline and directing convey the feel of a comic. I, at first, found some of the major characters annoying and unrealistic in their logic, however, I think that's mainly because in a comic book that level of hyperbole is completely appropriate and it often lends to the energy of the plot. I still find some lines and interactions annoying but they somehow don't detract from the show.

I feel like everyone cares not only about the show but the characters they portray. It's a top notch show I look forward to seeing more from.",1393113600,,662,4.508333333333334

5870212,4,B00DY64BLG,"On the whole the second season has yet to disappoint, save for a couple things. First, while it's understandable that those who head the show want the show to appeal to a broader base, it is still disappointing to those of us who were own over by the gritty ambition of the first season to see Oliver Queen/The Arrow watered down into an easier to digest, friendlier, more politically correct crusader.
Second, The Canary, originally enticing and mysterious, morphed into a shallow ""The Hood"" imitation following a botched reveal that could have been so much better. But this isn't a surprising development since The Arrow himself has thus far apparently lost a good portion of his ethos found on that island.  His partners in anti-crime, Feliciity and Diggle, are more than up to par and can tend to steal their fair share of scenes. As for the rest of the Queen family, Mr. Blood and the increasingly annoying Laurel, well, best thing to be said is time will tell.
Over on the positive column, Arrow still continues to deliver dynamite action scenes, typically well timed flashback scenes and a solid supporting cast. Moreover it still has something that seems to have alluded so many shows and movies based on comic books and graffic novels, namely a willingness to feature some of the biggest names in the source material's universe. That is one of the things that have season 1 so much curb appeal.  Moreover the rumor mill has it that this same aggressive approach may well lead to The Arrow making an appearance on the big screen with some other big boys in the DC comic's world. That would be something to see, especially if we could possibly get that older, more gritty Arrow back again....",1392595200,,1699,4.736486486486487

5870214,4,B00DY64BLG,I have always enjoyed secret identity shows and Arrow is no different.

5870287,5,B00DY64BLG,Excellent series. I enjoy how each season brings a new villan and how The hood keeps evolving. Good concept how Canary ties to the show. I think bringing on other DC heroes/ villains occasionally each season would also be a great series twist.

5870366,3,B00DY64BLG,"I never read the comics, so I have no reference for the original story, or how closely this holds to that storyline.  But what I liked so much about season 1 is starting to unravel now in season 2.

Season 1 impressed me with the pure ""humanness"" of the series.  I never read comic books as a kid, never got into superhero stories or anything, although I enjoy the various Hollywood movies that they've done the last several years.  But the first season was pure human strengths, not anything out of fantasy.  That made it so DIFFERENT from most other shows out there in the genre.  The only downside was how, as in all shows, the bad guys can be perfect shots when it comes to everyone around the protagonist, but when they shoot at the protagonist they can throw veritable walls of lead at the hero, and miss every time.  That gets old in all the movies and TV shows.

Season 1 ended with the storyline swinging towards the fantastic, which was depressing, since it was the lack of that fantasy stuff that really made me enjoy the show.  And it really started to take off with season 2, between the ""miracle drug"" they found making people into superhuman beings and the still unknown story arc with the one CSI agent who is in a coma after a particle accelerator mishap which scene ended with him having pink electricity shooting in his skin on his neck...  I'm afraid of where they're going to be taking this series now.

Maybe I'm in the vast minority who enjoyed the ""purity"" of the show, who actually LIKED having a ""superhero"" comic that wasn't about superpowers and such, and they felt they had to amp it up to keep the series alive by making it more like what has been ""proven"" in Hollywood to succeed.  Or maybe this is where the comic went, and they're following it religiously.  Either way, for me it's a let down because it's moving in the exact opposite direction of what drew me to it in the first place.

And now they're showcasing the girl/girl relationship, which while I fully support people having relationships with whomever they please, I'm just tired of TV shows trying to preach rather than simply entertain.

Actors for the most part do a rather good job, there's nobody that really jumps out as being a bad fit or doing a poor job.

But even with this disappointment, I still like it better than any other similar type of show on the TV.  I just hope in my own selfish way that it doesn't devolve into a show that I wouldn't enjoy anymore.  I may need to research the comic to give myself a head's up about what's in store.",1391904000,5,2549,4.4334763948497855

5870570,2,B00DY64BLG,"The first season was fresh and entertaining- but now it's descended into this soap opera on steroids. There is no character development, the first season's stars are largely ignored ... the villains have to be supermen who ""suddenly"" have all the connections, all the money, all the knowledge ... except for being able to put it together that they can just go up and wipe out Oliver's ""friends"" in one evening and then Oliver the next evening.

5870649,3,B00DY64BLG,"I want to start by saying I really want to like this show, but I just won't let me.  I think the problem is that the writing is constructed in such a way that there is no room for the audience members to use their brains.  The characters spend episode after episode going through over the top dramatic lamentations which are repetitive and entirely unnecessary.  I think the goal is that even if the audience was half brain dead they would still know the characters motivations.  I just can't imagine mature human beings who run multi-national corporations or train 24/7 to fight really dangerous enemies behaving this way.  Teenagers behave that way, but not responsible adults whose actions have life and death consequences.  It simply stretches the realm of believability.  Yes, it is a super hero show, but if it is set in the real world the characters should act like they belong in it.",1390953600,4,891,4.709677419354839
5870650,5,B00DY64BLG,This show is heavy on the dark side of human nature.  While no mistaking this for a great acting set.  The plots are good and the producer/director have turn this Marvel Book into a great series.  We love this show.  There are villains every turn and twist!  Pretty heavy on the gore!  Not recommended for the squeamish or people younger than 16!  We love the characters!,1390953600,,371,4.53030303030303
5870651,5,B00DY64BLG,"I've fallen in love with this series. I'm not sure if it's the characters or the way that they approach creating characters without magical superpowers. While I wouldn't call it flawless or as overall well done as many shows, I prefer Arrow. I connect with the characters and get pulled into every episode. I find the island intriguing and the flashbacks a great way to build the show and explain or introduce characters moving forward.",1390953600,,436,4.826666666666667

5870708,5,B00DY64BLG,"Arrow is a great drama with lots of twists and turns and high suspense. I like it because it's not the usual 'good guy' persona in the beginning.

5870710,5,B00DY64BLG,"Few things first - Arrow isn't like anything currently on TV, or TV past. It truly is a great combination of the DC Universe with a Movie Worthy Cast stuck on a lesser known network. Stephen Amell - aka Oliver Queen offers an amazing performance with each episode. Not only is the show great, but the cast and production crew has gone the extra mile to stay connected with their fan base online. Search Stephen Amell and you'll quickly find out that he operates his own facebook account to stay connect with his fans. If DC doesn't bring Arrow into the Movie side of the Universe they will be missing out on a chance to capitalize on a great thing - as I would easily compare Arrow to the Nolan Batman Trilogy.",1390867200,,710,4.386363636363637

5870757,5,B00DY64BLG,"Stumbled onto Arrow by chance and have binge-watched all available episodes to date.  Being a more ""senior"" viewer I remember the Green Arrow and Speedy in their comic book days.  While the current rendition varies markedly from what I remember, I, none the less, enjoy this adaptation of the DC Comics hero.

The series is a little ""soap opera-ish"" which, while probably necessary to draw a wider audience, sometimes gets in the way and confuses the hero's mission in Starling City.  Being born in Vancouver, I thoroughly enjoy the scenics and aerial shots of the city. Vancouver is a great city.  I think the characters are well drawn and the flashbacks to Oliver's time on the island do much to explain his present character.  I'm glad the flashbacks continue into the second season, particularly as new characters are woven into the stories.

I recommend ""Arrow"" for pure escape-ism and some great special effects.  Makes me want to run out and buy a bow... - Vidwiz",1390780800,,970,4.836363636363636
5870758,4,B00DY64BLG,Excellent adaptation of one of my favorite DC heroes. This reboot includes a number of surprises connected to the DC universe. Thoroughly enjoyable. Marvel's Agents of Shield should take some lessons from this  if they want to have another season...,1390780800,,249,5.225

Yes their customer support is great and has resolved all the issues, but why must there be so many issues in the first place? First a video was unavailable to watch (the link broke) after it had worked be4. Then it tried to have me pay for a new episode when I have the season pass.  Again, the support team was able to fix all the problems but why the bugs to begin with? Also what's the deal with the licensing or whatever, if an episode has already been fully aired on TV why does it take anywhere from a day to a week for it to be added to amazon? 5 stars for the show, 2 out of 5 for the service.",1390435200,,673,4.022388059701493

5870961,5,B00DY64BLG,"The second season picks up speed and introduces many new characters, with surprising plot twists.  This definitely holds your interest and keeps you coming back for more. We have recommended this series to our friends and family.",1390176000,,229,5.1891891891891895
5870962,5,B00DY64BLG,this is my all time favorite show lots of action love the characters and it also has a really good plot,1390176000,,103,3.9523809523809526
5870963,3,B00DY64BLG,"So, i really enjoyed the first season. There were a lot of traditional plot lines but they kept it fairly fresh with lots of new reveals from the island. The second season... it got a bit more involved. Every episode seemed to give Oliver's island experience another layer and i found it a little less engaging. But the action is there (although softened a bit with his focus on wounding rather than killing - which i found ok) and the characters stay strong. I'm intrigued and a little bit dubious about where they can go from here, and how long they can spin out the island, but i am enjoying sticking with it for a while longer.",1390176000,5,631,4.401709401709402
5870964,5,B00DY64BLG,Love this show! Great actors and great writing. Lots of action and plot twists. Highly entertaining. What more could you ask for?,1390176000,,129,4.909090909090909
5870965,5,B00DY64BLG,"Great characters, intriguing back and forth from present day to the island background development, good dialogue, plot twists, and acting.",1390089600,,138,5.95
5870966,2,B00DY64BLG,"The series started out with an interesting premise but the character could not hold that pose. Partly because of the decision of the writers to bring 'guilt' into the picture. This constantly messes up the character until finally he can't be the arrow because it might be immoral to kill someone. It's a TV show, not real life, please let him be the character and don't mess with him but throwing in pc values. Just because he doesn't feel guilt does not mean he is amoral. Why the either or? Another issue that plagues this is that the 'formula' for each episode is growing dull and resembles every other show, for example, take Nikita. The things to throw into each episode are too predictable. The need of the story arc to accomplish x or y in every episode is too predictable. Is this a cookie recipe used now in all such programs? I'm seeing it too often and that's why I feel a bit bored. So three is the best I can do and probably generous. It's cookie cutter quality but I expected more than a cartoon even if it was based on one.

UPDATE: I just started on Blind Spot, episode 11. It just gets worse and worse. The writing is terrible. The action is flat and gratuitous. It is completely UNBELIEVABLE that the father character would not have sympathy for his daughter and would side with Blood. Pathetic writing. Boring. I won't be buying season three. I'll watch what is left because I bought the season. If you like cartoon cookie cutter characters and flat plots that are predictable then maybe the action hero theme will be enough and you will like the series.",1390089600,7,1573,4.5
5870977,5,B00DY64BLG,Arrow is a great show. I have seen all of the first season and cannot wait for more of season 2 to come out!,1390089600,,108,3.5416666666666665

5870979,5,B00DY64BLG,"I am thankful to live in an age when people can stream their favorite shows at their own convenience. I am also thankful that Amazon and others have made it painless to do so.  We don't watch network TV and even if we did, our schedule would not allow us to watch when the broadcasts are aired. This show is entertaining. It is a little dark sometimes, and the viewer is often left to his/her own conclusion as to whether the actions in the plot are right or wrong. It is intellectually stimulating to keep up with multiple plot lines. The writers do a good job most of the time (sometimes it seems to take too long to resolve an issue when one watches one episode right after another) and the actors make the story come alive. Kudos all around.",1390089600,,745,4.321428571428571

5870985,3,B00DY64BLG,The first season held my attention because of the periodic flashbacks which shed light on Oliver Queen's experiences while marooned for 5 years on a mysterious island. I have only seen two episodes of the second season. So far the unravelling of the mystery seems a bit fantastical even for this type of show.,1390003200,2,309,4.7407407407407405

The dual story lines of what happened on the island and what is happening now in the city are terrific.  Great writing and excellent casting.

This was enjoyable for me the first season, the 2nd especially the superhero girls etc just started getting tired and over the top. I lump this in with SleepyHollow, cant even make it through the first season even though I already paid for it. I will say I am still watching revolution though and it keeps my interest. I am done watching the arrow even though you can catch free episodes. This is just how it goes for most shows, only a few can be good or great",1389830400,,573,4.314814814814815

(**SPOILERS**)
They continue right where we left off, with the Glades being blown to pieces. Now Oliver and crew have to fight new bad guys. The show is still very interesting but Green Arrow is not doing his whole ""You have failed this city!"" bit as much anymore.

5871220,5,B00DY64BLG,"Arrow is one of the few TV based comic based shows that doesn't go overboard on computer generated special effects.  It stays grounded in a reality, much more like your Dark Knight style.  The characters are well developed over time and are all flawed in some way which makes it all more real.  The ""Hero"" of the show isn't necessarily always a ""good"" guy.  He does things that you don't  agree with, but you still like him.  Arrow isn't perfect, and has it's flaws like any show, but is one of those shows I still consistently look forward to new episodes off.",1389571200,,561,4.450980392156863

He's one of the best villains I've ever seen.  Of course, John Barrowman is so talented, he could have been cast as the hero.  I became a fan of Susanna Thompson when she played Mark Harmon's love interest in NCIS. David Ramsey is a hunk - love the workout scenes between him and Stephen Amell.

5871334,4,B00DY64BLG,This is a great twist on the arrow story. You need to get past the first couple episodes the acting gets better with time.,1389139200,,122,4.125
5871335,5,B00DY64BLG,Very good series with a good plot and action! It keeps you interested unlike other series that go on longer than they should.,1389139200,,125,4.478260869565218
5871336,5,B00DY64BLG,I Love being able to watch episodes that aren't on any subscription websites.  $3 is a fair price for HD.,1389139200,,105,4.25

I just loved it!",1389052800,,105,4.3
5871367,4,B00DY64BLG,"Good show, good story lines, the acting is a little cheesy but it is based on a comic book character. I like the character development and how they keep bringing new characters in to set up a Justice League spin off.",1389052800,,216,4.2926829268292686
5871368,5,B00DY64BLG,"Had watched the first season on Netflix.  So went to Hulu for second season, but since it had already started they only had last five shows which made me miss the first three or four shows of the season so decided to buy the ones I had missed on Amazonpime.  I really love Amazonprime.  I don't think a day goes by that I don't go to Amazonprime for one reason or another. A lot of the shows I get free and some that I really love I don't mind paying a $1.89 to see.",1389052800,,466,3.9361702127659575

5871371,5,B00DY64BLG,"The show is awesome, it's just that simple. Sets the bar for DC comics TV shows as high as The Dark Knight did for movies. It's the standard and anything less is poop.",1388966400,,167,4.090909090909091
5871372,4,B00DY64BLG,"I like DC Comic and Marvel based movies and shows, this program was a recommendation based on other shows I have watched. I don't watch the CW network so I didn't know about Arrow or the new Beauty & The Beast. I was very entertained by the story, setting and acting. The violence and moral questions it raises would make it TV 14 in my view.",1388966400,,342,4.196969696969697
5871373,5,B00DY64BLG,Great show so far! I enjoy following the characters as they face all kinds of challenges and evolve as people.,1388966400,,110,4.55

5871407,5,B00DY64BLG,"I think this concept is far more interesting than the Batman series.  I like that he has to interact with family and friends.
I did not like that Tommy had to dis so early on in the series but I see how it created the extended character in season 2.",1388966400,,249,3.98
5871408,5,B00DY64BLG,"I find few shows these days stand up to binge watching through Netflix or Amazon.  But just as this show starts to annoy me in some ways, they change it up and get my interest back.  I was getting tired of Laurel's mopey face and how she showed up every 2 minutes all over the place, but they seem to be toning down that storyline.  I like how Felicity is getting more attention.  The island plot seems to be making sense...I had worried that it might be like Lost, where the writers seemed to be winging it towards a disappointing/nonsensical end... I like how there are strong female characters that don't scream too much.  But mainly, each episode is a fun story, and over time there is good character development.",1388966400,,717,4.484615384615385
5871409,5,B00DY64BLG,"This show just gets better and better.

5871413,4,B00DY64BLG,Tough time seeing the connections to original DC comics or new 52. Over all the acting is pretty decent. Fun show,1388880000,,113,4.428571428571429
5871414,5,B00DY64BLG,"Season 2 of the series Arrow, I absolutely loved it! Fast paced, fun twists, and hang onto your chair developments! At 9 episodes it was much to short!",1388880000,,151,4.428571428571429

5871448,5,B00DY64BLG,"Green arrow was one of my favorite characters growing up, and though some of the key characters, namely Dinah not being canary kind of bugs me, this show is really great. It stays realistic but isn't afraid to go super now either. Welcome my other and single most favorite character; Barry Allen. I feel like he is too young a bit but the actor couldn't have played him better. There was so much content and it was all done so well. This is a show I hope to keeps going forward and doesn't get stuck in mediocrity like Smallville eventually did.",1388880000,,545,4.405940594059406
5871449,5,B00DY64BLG,Another hit for me by The CW network the action/drama show with a great cast and great writing.  Full of great plot twists and lots of fight scenes and really well done special effects.  Watched all the back shows i could find and now i am caught up and ready to watch it on the regular tv station.,1388880000,,298,4.120689655172414
5871450,4,B00DY64BLG,"Good, over the top, comic book fun. I didn't often catch the characters acting so the stories roll along entertainingly. Recommended to grown up 50s kids and teens, well versed in the suspension of disbelief.",1388793600,,208,4.9714285714285715
5871451,5,B00DY64BLG,I love this show.  Can't get enough of it.  Each season just keeps getting better. Can't wait for next season to get here.,1388793600,,122,4.260869565217392
5871452,5,B00DY64BLG,"I did not think I would like Arrow when I first started watching it, but I will be damned if I was wrong.  The first season took a few episodes to find its footing, but turned into on of my favorite shows of the season.  Season two is halfway done, and has managed to surpass the first season in every way.  I cannot recommend it enough.",1388793600,,337,4.075757575757576

5871456,4,B00DY64BLG,"I love this show, although I usually catch it on demand or Hulu, and I think that Laurel is becoming an idiot because she feels guilty she's blaming someone else, and I think that Oliver, should really be with someone (Felicity), who knows every bit of his personality, I do love this show.",1388793600,,290,4.490566037735849
5871487,4,B00DY64BLG,"Watched it half heartedly live but was always confused by the many characters. Got netflix, caught up from S1 and now want to be completely in the know for the return in January. Very helpful to be able to buy only the ones I needed to see, and really enjoying the show now.",1388793600,,274,4.188679245283019

5871490,5,B00DY64BLG,It is a great show that keeps you on your toes wondering what is going to happen next. How Arrow gets out of jams that you know he is going to get killed or caught.,1388707200,,164,3.7142857142857144
5871491,4,B00DY64BLG,"The acting was to excessive in some parts and the scripts seemed a bit like a rag doll. Though the flash back were very timely and well set, the differences between the Oliver in the past and present don't seem to correlate to much. Almost as if it's two different people, the girly voice, hair, personalities (he tries to be like his old self, but it just doesn't seem to match his old personality at all. It's like a fake) nothing really seems right. Though it's a great idea, the script writers and the director need to do a better job. Take a hint from AMC, they got there act together.",1388707200,,590,4.324324324324325

5871507,5,B00DY64BLG,"This show is shown in two dimensions one in real time the other in the past. I love the stories of the island they help to understand his reactions to the present things. I love the demeanor of the Trio. That's what I call them the"" Mighty Trio"".
Awesome show. There are now several of my family members watching.

5871538,5,B00DY64BLG,Really well done! Love the show. You can't predict what's coming like most shows. A modern day Robin Hood put a much better cause. My whole family can't wait until the next week too watch the new episode,1388534400,,203,4.368421052631579

5871543,5,B00DY64BLG,"This is a stew of action with just the right amounts of mayhem, intrigue and love interest thrown in to keep you coming back.  It's got to be good for us to pay to watch the episodes in the second season rather than just wait for them to be free in Prime.

Stephen Amell's portrayal of the comic book hero is nuanced and intelligent;  his seamless transitions from daredevil athlete and arrogant rich boy to the vulnerable, wounded survivor hiding beneath both masks makes the second season of Arrow a pleasure to watch, and I can't wait to see what new plot twists the next installment will bring to this engaging modern-day saga.  :-)",1388361600,,472,5.0256410256410255

Lucky for me I had friends who nice enough to let me know what a great show it actually is. I just finished watching season 1 and catching up on Season two in less than a week. I am now having to stop myself from going back and watching it all over again. Though I do plan to bring many of my friends kicking and screaming to finally see what a great show the CW and DC Entertainment have managed to put other. From the first episode you get a sense that this isn't like a lot of the shows being shown on TV. Give it a shot.,1388361600,,631,3.8244274809160306

5871606,5,B00DY64BLG,The series is very entertaining. For a tv program they have spent the time being detailed and careful in the action sequences and sets to make each episode feel like your in the movie theater,1388275200,,191,4.485714285714286
5871637,4,B00DY64BLG,"I was thoroughly impressed with how believable the motivations are for the main characters, and also impressed by the writers' ability to fashion interesting villains without making them too cartoonish. Steven Amell has just nailed the juxtaposition and angst that Oliver Queen lives with. Supporting cast is solid. Sometimes a little cheesy, sometimes a little simple in the dialogue, and often a little too much teeny-bopper romantic drama. But hey, it's a CW show. But overall I love this show and hope it has a nice run.",1388275200,,524,5.0344827586206895
5871638,4,B00DY64BLG,"Very exciting, action filled, man show.  Somewhat predictable and acting is lackluster at times, but if you enjoy superhero genre, this series is a winner.  If I could wish for anything -the plot could use some levity.  A few relaxed moments would break the tension.",1388275200,,266,4.866666666666666

5871641,5,B00DY64BLG,I didn't start watching this show until the start of 2nd season where I then watched all of season 1 and then caught up to what is live on tv. Great cast and enjoy the references/easter eggs. If you are a fan of comics and shows like Smallville then you should love this show. It's very addicting.,1388188800,,297,4.228070175438597

5871644,2,B00DY64BLG,"This is a great plot with TERRIBLE and somewhat juvenile writers.  Maybe they are trying to appeal to a younger audience and in that effort not allowing a GREAT cast to appear more sophisticated.  The actors do the best with the dialogue they can but I CRINGE at some of the dialogue that leaves their lips.  Even my teenage daughter watches with me to see wonderful scenes created then we both say "" PLEASE DON'T SAY A WORD, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE"" .  They can make this series 10-times better by firing the writers...keep whomever creates the scenes and fight sequences...everything else is TOP quality but the dialogue just SUCKS.  I continue to watch because all else is just that good. I hope with each episode to see less corny dialogue and a little more sophistication by simply holding 'silent' in some scenes that 'BEG' for it.",1388188800,9,834,4.684931506849315

I love this show, the characters and their interactions with one another are great. Finally caught up to season 2 mid season finale.

5871663,3,B00DY64BLG,"I thought that the 1st season of this series was amazing, and I totally loved it. I was greatly anticipating season 2, and was extremely disappointed in it. They took the show in a completely strange direction, and for that reason, I give it a mediocre review.",1388102400,2,260,4.553191489361702
5871664,5,B00DY64BLG,"In my opinion this series is a video comic book.  Oops, I should say video graphic novel?  The story lines and characters are interesting. As in a graphic novel one needs to suspend disbelief to truly enjoy the episodes.
If one prefers to watch Arrow on the larger TV screen you'll be disappointed watching the episodes on your Kindle or your computer. If this is the case (and this doesn't have any thing to do with critiquing the series), get a ROKU and watch Arrow on the tube. Or, if Arrow is now televised in your area you can watch it every week. BUT by using Amazon video you watch them before the episodes are televised and you don't have to wait a week before watching the next episode.",1388102400,,695,4.37984496124031
5871665,5,B00DY64BLG,"I watched the first season of this show and became hooked. I read some of the Green Arrow comics in my youth which I found to be stupid but this show is not like the comic. The Green Arrow that was in Smallville can't compare to ""Arrow"". This show is more grounded in the real type world. The ""Arrow"" as they refer to does do in the bad guys (That's kills them). Even in the ""Man of Steel"" Superman had to make a choice to save lives beyond the comic book image. The characters in the show draw on comic book characters in some way but with a twist. The Black Canary in ""Arrow"" is not the same as the comic book but the ""Huntress"" seems to be following the same type story line. Oliver Queen (The Arrow) has a family which adds to the plot. Also I'm learning some Russian from the show.",1388102400,,786,4.1103896103896105
5871666,5,B00DY64BLG,"A friend of mine recommended this show to me. As a big fan of Marvel, Sci-Fi, anything Joss Whedon I respected the premise, but was a bit weary of a show based on a mid-level DC character (With the exception of Batman, I find their catalogue of heroes a bit meh. That, and none of the cities are real, which for some reason irks me considerably.). Color me totally surprised. For a show on a CW budget, it makes the most of it's dollars, with great cinematography, direction and fight scenes that are very well choreographed. The acting is good all around, with fully fleshed out characters and witty banter. It does tend to occasionally lean on the ""villain of the week,"" but the overarching story line is well done. My wife also found a new celebrity crush in Stephen Amell. We watched all 33 current episodes in about ten days.",1388102400,,830,4.503311258278146
5871687,5,B00DY64BLG,"I've been on a marathon viewing of the first season and will have to purchase some from the second season to finish up. This is a great show and actually shows evolution of the main character especially as he reflects upon his experiences from his five year survival on the island. He's tough but cares about his family and friends and what can I say? Ever since Disney's Robin Hood, I've had an interest in archers! ;o)",1388102400,,420,4.467532467532467

I must admit loving Stephen Amell even more as an amazing actor and person as a whole, he stays grounded know matter how big the show gets, I would give this show more stars if there were more..",1388102400,,599,4.042016806722689
5871692,5,B00DY64BLG,"This is a great TV series for those of you who are superhero fans.  Unlike typical superheros (i.e. Iron Man, Hulk, Superman, etc), this hero is believable - an ""ordinary guy"" with special training and a lot of money (kind-of like Batman).  It's also a bit ""dark"" (also similar to Batman) both in its artistic style and in the struggles of the hero.

So far the series seems family friendly.  There are some suggestive sexual encounters and a general acceptance of casual sex.  But no nudity and the sexual content probably appears in only about 1 out of every 5-10 shows.  There is death and violence in the series, but the violence is not bloody or gratuitous (it's similar to what you would expect in a comic book or a superhero movie).

The story line is fairly engaging, the acting is good, and the plot is fairly consistent.  Season 1 was excellent.  Season two has become a little more far-fetched as most second seasons tend to do in this type of show.",1388016000,,960,4.534883720930233

5871850,5,B00DY64BLG,"From a write-up of the midseason finale at comicbook.com - With the League of Assassins waiting in the wings (and thats just a huge, explosive mess waiting to happen, with two of Ras al Ghuls most wanted assassins in Starling at the moment), Arrow has taken on the superhero mask and is starting to own his hero persona. Hes also going to be facing down Brother Blood (whom he knows about), Solomon Grundy (how could he possibly guess?) and Deathstroke (which may occur to him once Cyrus Gold rises from the apparently-dead, but right now remains a mystery).

Whether those two major groups of villains (the League of Assassins, and Deathstrokes group, including Brother Blood and Grundy) will ever collide with one another or not, thats enough to keep the team busy even if there wasn't any fallout from the midseason finaleincluding Roys being dosed by Blood, Felicitys almost-relationship with Barry Allen and more.

Somehow, though, the two-part midseason finale managed to seed all of that (plus the origin of The Flash) without seeming shallow or stretched thin. The writers are pacing this show out perfectly and its head, shoulders, quiver and hood better than it was this time last year. Its not just the most exciting comics show on TV right now, but the most fun Im having on TV this season, full stop.",1386979200,,1313,4.831111111111111
5871851,5,B00DY64BLG,"Awesome! The best show on tv!!!!! I love Arrow because it has action,romance,and great story lines. Best of all I love Stephen Amell.",1386979200,,133,4.826086956521739
5871852,4,B00DY64BLG,This is a fun series; I did scream out loud when yet again another character came back from the dead; just don't take this series  too seriously.,1386979200,,145,4.37037037037037
5871853,4,B00DY64BLG,"Season 2 is quite good, but like the 2006-2010 show HEROES, the second season simply can't live up to the perfection of the 5-star premier season. Here's a couple of reasons why:

[1] A fun part in both serials was when the core characters first met one another and also when secret identities were revealed. While important new characters are introduced in s2, some of the initial excitement has worn off. Luckily for Arrow, there are plenty of characters who have yet to learn about the secret lives of other characters.

[2] It is now much more difficult to suspend one's disbelief; this is due to a more traditional comic book hero vibe being adopted (as opposed to season 1, where you could *almost* believe that the events transpired in an exaggerated U.S. metropolis), as well as the mid-season introduction of one of DC's more fantastical heroes in the ep ""Three Ghosts"". While comic fans may appreciate this move towards more of DC's universe in s2, the rest of us can have a difficult time trying to swallow the acceleration from fiction into far-fetched fantasy. I will likely get hate mail for saying it, but it had to be said.

Arrow will easily make it to season 4 (as HEROES did, despite plummeting ratings), but I also have a hunch that no subsequent season will be able to recreate the chemistry of perfection seen in season 1 (as happened with HEROES).

That said, this remains a prime (but not yet ""Amazon Prime"") series that continues to deliver television done right.

UPDATE 2/7/2014: OK we are now halfway thru season 2 and the pace of the show continues to remain very well balanced; furthermore, each ep leaves you with a craving for the next, as was true in season 1. They aren't going overboard with the fantastical superhero shtuff as much as I had anticipated after ""The Scientist"" and ""Three Ghosts"", although a tendency to go ""over the top"" remains the show's only consistent flaw. Oh well, it's still a tremendous amount of fun, and if you are invested in the characters you won't be disappointed. Felicity Smoak remains a favorite, and it will be interesting to see where her character goes (hopefully she won't jump ship onto the upcoming serial ""The Flash"" that has been ordered by the CW, although I would be thrilled if she appears on BOTH).

UPDATE 5/14/14: Still a good show but it doesn't have me on the edge of my seat like season 1. The flashbacks to the island are getting tedious and interrupting the here and now story that I actually want to be watching. While so much could be done with the island story, the writers are floundering. Going back and forth between the ship and the island: who cares? I want to see what is going on in Starling City. Secret identities have been revealed to more of supporting characters, but with no consequence. Hope to see improvement in season 3.",1386979200,,2827,4.655310621242485

It's too bad really, because it has a good cast and I do like how they are trying to tell two stories at the same time, but the script writing and editing are lacking in continuity and common sense, and all the characters have the emotional maturity of eight year olds.

I get that I'm not the target demographic for this show, but I'd like to think teenagers don't appreciate gaping plot holes and senseless melodrama either. :p",1386633600,5,597,4.330357142857143

My 16 year old son turned me on to this show and so now my younger 2 sons (14 and 12) watch it ASAP.  For a while we were gorging on season 1 on Netflix, and were watching 1 show a night.  Now we are almost caught up on Hulu but 3 episodes were MIA (purchased them on amazon).  The main characters are all real life cool, plus omg that body!!  I really don't need to name a name here... 8)  he is SO good as Oliver - calm, humble, but all knowing without being cheesy.  The 2nd season had a big surprise start with a return of a ""dead"" character and although we like her, the actor has many uncomfortable and unnatural mouth expressions that do distract us a bit. I only mention this because the role is significant and all of us notice it a lot.  We really love the intelligent, MIT educated female sidekick Felicity )my 16 year old is infatuated big time) and her genuine quirkiness -a dork in disguise.  :) we all  Love Felicity.  The fights on this show are epic and original.  A triple head slam against a wall is something that comes to mind from season 1 but there is an endless list.",1386374400,31,1200,4.1695652173913045

The show features outright theft of themes from The Dark Knight movie series and slightly altered genre cliches, melodrama performed by the star and his apparent love interest obviously not chosen primarily for the likelihood of their winning Emmys, and fight scenes that seem to owe more to enthusiastic editing than choreography or stunts.

5872197,4,B00DY64BLG,"It would be easy to pick countless holes in the plot lines of this series, but it is after all a comic book so that would be a pointless exercise. Even so, the most glaring recent example in Season 2 is the ""reappearance"" of Sara Lance (Caity Lotz) as the Black Canary - the blonde, masked, ninja avenger. Oliver affects to be stunned by the discovery that she did not drown when his father's boat sank (the event that launched the series) after which he was marooned on the hellish island to which flashbacks are a large part of the overarching plot. However, we soon learn that he could not have been surprised because she shows up on the island in flashbacks as part of the enigmatic enemy camp and there is much interaction between them there. This is, of course, mere quibbling over one continuity flaw when in fact the entire series is filled with similar comic book absurdity, demanding a massive measure of the willful suspension of disbelief. It is, nevertheless, quite entertaining absurdity - however fraught with outrageous implausibilities - and all the female characters, from the evil China White (Kelly Hu) to Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards), are delicious eye-candy.

Arrow fits right in - the guy gets angry, he doubts himself, he makes poor choices, and his seemingly selfless acts often have a selfish motive.

Detective Lance who hunt down the ""Hood"" (Oliver Queen' s alias) was demoted to a patrol officer since the first season, and his daughter (Oliver's former lover) is working the police to catch the ""Arrow"" (Another one of Oliver's alias) because of her blaming the Arrow for the death of her lover (Oliver's friend) in the events of season one, ironic that in season one she would see him as a good guy but his dad see him as bad but now when the hood turned in criminals alive and not critically wounded he sees him as a good guy and gives him the alias of the arrow, and now a new vigilante appears that would be a ghost of Oliver's past that everyone questioned about but assumed it just as he said it was. As fanboys watch this series based on the DC comics character ""Green Arrow"" they are probably waiting for Roy Harper to shine as in the comics he is the Green Arrow' s sidekick With Alias' s such as; Speedy, Red Arrow, And Arsenal. So far he's made an appearance in the mid season of the first season and has been coming out regularly on episodes and in season two it starts to get closer where he is working with the arrow and hopefully eventually becoming his sidekick and being a better on tv hero and sidekick unlike 1990's ""Batman and Robin"" that was a complete train wreck, not my opinion everyone at that time and know now's it. So far things are building and its hitting the fan as Oliver's flashbacks are even related to the events that are happening now and I can't wait to see the more episodes to come.",1383696000,,2098,4.260651629072682

Seeing things unfold on the island and how they relate back to Oliver's current life is cool.  Though a bit far fetched that everything that happens in Starling City revolves around the island.

I'll be the first to say it.  I HATE LAUREL she just does not fit in the world of Arrow.  I love her father he makes mistakes he gets angry sometimes but he is doing the best he can.  I love most of the other characters in the show, I love the Queen family.  But the whole falling in and out of love between best friends and former lovers that caused horrible tragedy in your family is tiresome and unbelievable.  People make stupid mistakes in there love life but her character is just to far fetched in such a well written show.  I understand they may need her for future character development but as it stands now she is an unwanted distraction.

To give a small spoiler example from the second episode in this season.  The Glades have fallen to criminals and apparently the police do not go out at night (I'll accept that in this show).  So medicine being delivered ""for some reason always at night"" to the hospital keeps getting hijacked putting many hundreds/thousands of patience at risk.  Its 'Too dangerous' to assign a police escort to the medical deliveries.  However as soon as the hood shows up to protect the medicine, Laurel and a phalanx of a 1000 cops show up to catch him because the hood let her down one time by not saving her 'boyfriend'.  How is she in charge of people?  The Police just follow her lead not to go after the bad guys that could cause the deaths of hundreds because The Hood didn't save her boy friend?  She is not even a captain or a commissioner or police chief, she is just a DA.  Nothing that involves Laurel makes any sense.  Please take the time to write her character better.  Her character is taking this show down the path of Smallville.",1383436800,5,1965,4.450980392156863

5872445,3,B00DY64BLG,"Mediocre at best. The shoddy acting is really what holds this show down, but if you can look past that then there are a few good points in it's favor. It's really hard to overlook the fact that it's so obvious that the Hood is Oliver, until this episode he didn't even bother wearing a mask. I know, I know, he had some kind of greasy face paint that did NOT fool anyone.  Oh wait, it fooled everyone. While I am facepalming thinking to myself ""Is everyone in this show really that stupid?? Yes, apparently they are.

The action sequences are very well done, the costume and the hardware realistic.  The plot (in my opinion) is fairly cheesy and cliche. Every new character introduction is a new love interest and will, unwaveringly, develop some kind of superpower. A superpower that will, by inevitable misunderstanding, turn them against the protagonist and an entire season will be filled with correcting said misunderstanding by fist or by politics.  blah blah blah  but watchable. If I was to write a detailed review it would be summed up as ""fun, but predictable and overly cliche"".

So in summary:  If you like a show you can fast forward to the fight scenes and still know what's happening, and what's going to happen next, then this show is for you.",1382054400,2,1259,4.618834080717488

With the help of Diggle and Felicity, there is a new way to dispense that justice without the body count.

the cast just seems to flow together (although the son becoming the enemy plotline  - shades of Spider Man is lame).  The enemies not only on the streets but in the boardroom will add a huge amount of depth and entertainment to this show this season.

I am getting a bad feeling that they are going to turn this into one of those shows where he never kills anyone because he is so non-violent and such.  I hate it when the politically correct gurus get into my favorite shows and I hope this does not become another casualty of the politically correct.  Call me funny but I prefer to see evil murdering bad guys in the ground rather than an unrealistic ""justice"" that tries to make me believe these rich guys cannot buy a lawyer good enough to get them off.",1381363200,15,1135,4.300469483568075

8598923,4,B00DY64BLG,"I love this show. It has lots of action, the supporting characters are super strong, and the human elements are solid. I love the character development and the way new characters are introduced. The cast of this show is probably the best of any on TV right now.

The show has a few negative elements, though they're relatively minor. Most are typical, in that they fail to portray real life accurately:

1. Some people may be irritated by the tiny masks that the characters wear, which really don't hide their identities at all. But that's a typical comic book setup and doesn't bother me at all.

2. The characters often hide secrets from each other even though in real life they would likely reveal those secrets to those who are really closest to them. Again, understandable as a plot device, but the writers sure seem to use this a lot. Almost to the point of sitcom-like dependence.

3. Some situations show no research by the writers at all. For instance, in one scene, a doctor starts rattling off medical history about Sara to her sister, Laurel, before Laurel visits her at the hospital. In real life, no doctor would do this due to confidentiality laws. It's done in especially sloppily on the show, because Laurel could have noted the same medical conditions by just seeing her sister with her shirt off (which she does in the same scene).

4. Another huge gaffe is when a supervillain takes control of Queen Consolidated. Even though the Queens own 50% of this multibillion dollar corporation, the takeover supervillain somehow manages to ""dilute"" all of the Queens' holdings to the point that they're basically worthless. Everything about the takeover, the ownership thereafter, and the dilution makes no sense, even to a high school business student. Further, it never made sense that Oliver Queen kept hanging around at the company rather than just selling everything to the takeover artist when he didn't know that she was a supervillain. And did the Queens have the worst estate-planning advice ever in the history of rich people? What, now they're broke? They don't have trust funds? The entire fortune is tied up in 50% of the stock of a Fortune 500 company rather than being diversified even a tiny little bit? They don't sell stock over time and put the cash into trust funds in unrelated assets? This is not at all like real life.

But if you can get past some of the silly fails in business and legal knowledge shown by the writers (I did), this show is quite good.",1528761600,,2488,4.721198156682028
