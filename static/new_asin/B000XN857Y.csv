8228748,1,B000XN857Y,"1 star is more than this dvd deserves.  $29 bucks??!!  Are you kidding me??!!  I bought it for $2.00 at a yard sale and wish I could get my money back.  There were no secrets here, certainly no winning ones.  And the copyright (on mine) is 1996, 18 years ago.  If this is the same production, it is sorely dated on top of being an absolute waste of time and money.  Slots don't drop coins anymore, just as one small example.  The only secrets revealed here is 'how' the casinos win...offering literally BILLIONS of combination possibilities on the multi-rell, multi-line, especially progressive slots...but we already knew that.  We also know that playing the higher denomination slots supposedly offer better odds.  Supposedly.  You can still go broke playing the higher denomination slots, just much faster.  So, I'm sorry, I don't think there is a book or dvd out there that has the 'system' figured out.  Here's the real secret:  There is no secret.  The odds are against you.  Period.  That being said, I LOVE playing them, they're great fun, as long as you discipline yourself.  That was the only worthwhile advice offered in this dvd, and that really is no secret.",1409097600,,1171,4.77
8228749,2,B000XN857Y,"I sent for several books,  including this OLD DVD.  This was very disgusting.  Many years ago,  1999 to 2003 I purchased many books from Amazon, all on Slot machines by many different authors,  Also purchased 4 VHS tapes ""WINNING SLOT SECRETS BY David Wilhite""  Photos taken in Los Vegas .  This DVD is nothing but an exact copy of the VHS made over 10 years ago, which I have. It is also very old, as there are no machines available to play that this DVD shows.  It is worthless and a Scam. to sell something that has no value anymore.

  I purchased this DVD as I assumed it was based on the New Machines with print out slips which are out  over 7 years ago.  I wanted to send it back, but don't know how as I ordered several books with it.  I would like my money back, or a credit toward an new book available on Slots.  However, I have two I purchased in the last few years.  Regards,  Norman Faut",1368230400,,901,4.145348837209302
