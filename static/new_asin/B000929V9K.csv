2260699,4,B000929V9K,"Most of these thirteen 'toons hail from 1963, when Casper was on TV on Matty's Funday Funnies (later Casper was replaced by Beanie and Cecil), along with a few theatrical releases from 1952, '54 and '58. The  '60s Casper 'toons are probably the best known, since they were rerun endlessly in syndication and accompanied the Harvey comics of the period.

While adults might find some of the '60s crop somewhat slow, Casper is a young fan's favorite, and they are better than later Casper revivals (which they are often confused with) by other studios. This is a quality collection from Sony Wonder/ Classic Media, not another of those ""Casper and Friends"" DVDs where you get one Casper 'toon. Every 'toon features Casper, who in these 'toons lives with the Ghostly trio, and some star his Harvey comics friends, Wendy, Spooky, and Nightmare. Also, these are different 'toons than the standard handful that show up over and over on cartoon collections. The '60s ones are about three minutes each, and were originally shown on shows with live hosts or other cartoon segments. The 'fifties 'toons are somewhat longer, being made for theatrical release, and are taken from good prints. All in all, a good collection. I list the contents here (which are not listed on the package):

A Visit from Mars; The Absent Minded Robot; Bedtime Trouble; Boos and Saddles; Doing What's Fright; The Enchanted Horse; Little Lost Ghost; Small Spooks; Super Spooks; True Boo; Twin Trouble; Zero the Hero; Growing Up.",1128902400,28,1495,4.948207171314741
