I still haven't been able to watch it but I bought also Raavan which the same story lime except that the actors differ except for the 2 women.",1429401600,,290,4.105263157894737
8432043,4,B004JZJGRA,"As a person who is is obsessed with Mani Ratnam's work.. I really tried to love this movie. And there is a lot to love - the locations are exquisite and storyline is fairly good. The problem is with the dialogue delivery. The use of a local Tirunelveli? tamil in a number of places spoken by people who have never spoken that type of tamil in their lives makes it very uncomfortable to hear. The words are beautiful but there is no conviction behind them. Aishwarya is beautiful and shows a reasonable range of emotion but her dubbing is quite bad. The music is amazing. Especially the end credits song but again since the movie used the same tunes for hindi also, the words in tamil seem to be stuffed into the available music. ""Whatever word fits, lets throw it in there"" kind of lyrics. Vikram and Aishwarya have no chemistry. She falls in love with him because his sister was raped by a bunch of policemen? Come on. I understand that Mani Ratnam is very attracted to Bollywood and Hindi but time and again it has failed him. Why not focus on the Tamil industry where your work is not only appreciated but also very understood?",1347148800,,1130,4.463768115942029
8432044,4,B004JZJGRA,Melodramatic. Beautifully and creatively shot. A little crazy. And with a bit of a water fetish. I enjoyed Raavanan a lot.,1322092800,2,122,4.857142857142857
8432045,5,B004JZJGRA,"Vikram, as Veera is outstanding and so is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, as Ragini. IMO, many of the directorial & editing choices are more effective here than in the Hindi version - Raavan.
And while Aish excels in both the Hindi & Tamil versions, unfortunately, in Raavan (Hindi), some of the other casting choices, (Abhishek Bachchan as Veera, Vikram as Dev), just didn't work for me. Very happy I finally got a chance to see Raavanan! This Tamil version has to be much closer to Mani Ratham's directorial vision.",1307750400,,509,4.795454545454546
