8745869,1,B019QUWFHK,Why is there no mention of the lack of English subtitles? DVD arrived very promptly in the UK but I was very disappointed that I was unable to appreciate what I'm sure is fascinating content.,1453507200,,191,4.485714285714286
8745870,5,B019QUWFHK,"This DVD (currently PAL, but playable on computers and laptops in America) is a treasure! A must for all serious students and teachers of vocal artistry. Dame Elisabeth, here in her last year, is quite simply radiant as she imparts vocal wisdom and perfection to her lucky students with precision, insistence, love and humor. She was a miracle on stage, and no less so here. Bravissima e grazie!",1451865600,,395,4.823529411764706
