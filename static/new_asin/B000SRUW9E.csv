8206536,5,B000SRUW9E,"I was in the Bay Area when this took place.  The ""city hall riot"" was a real one.  This gives the background of how the Communist Party (CP) was trying to infiltrate various unions and especially the teachers union.  When the House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC) tried to expose their tactics the CP had to destroy the HUAC and stop the hearings.  The film shows their efforts and calling it a propaganda film really is inaccurate.  The CP called in a number of young activists from the Berkeley campus and the fight was on.  It's a shame but the only way the hidden agenda of the CP was outed effectively was through the efforts of HCUA.  The media just was not interested in exposing their machinations.",1395273600,5,713,4.611111111111111
8206537,5,B000SRUW9E,"This is an excellent 43 minute video with introductions by two Congressmen from the early 1960s. There is real time footage from 1960 which illustrates how the communists/Marxists/progressives/liberals of the day manipulated the Congress and the American people. By today's standards the footage seems quite tame, but in 1960 the activities filmed here were quite revolutionary. Regardless, the point made in the video is that people are easily manipulated when their minds are not engaged in what they are really doing and in particular young people (college students in the video). A few communists incited a mass ""sheep-like"" behavior amongst hundreds if not thousands of unwary students, who likely thought they were participating in a useful protest, but were instead being manipulated royally. This video is not particularly entertaining (like todays so-called news is more entertainment than news), but it is on point. Worth a watch.",1362960000,4,940,5.445205479452055
