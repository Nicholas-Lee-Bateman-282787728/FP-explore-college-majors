8340927,3,B001TBM3A4,Not really what i expected. If you have any  experience training Jiu Jitsu then the last 10 minutes or so of this dvd is useful. For the novice it's pretty good. Professor Machado does a good job explaining the basics.,1434585600,,218,4.45

8340929,4,B001TBM3A4,This DVD is a complement of Mayor Avi Nardia's book. It is recommended because it is very good. I'd like Mayor Nardia make a DVD explaining Kapap's principles in each movement. This would be very useful.,1360627200,,203,4.666666666666667
8340930,4,B001TBM3A4,"Krav Maga/KAPOP is such a versatile method of defense/offense,that I'd have been surprised if it hadn't been adopted (w/slight modifications) by the Israelis. Having said that,however,I personally find ground scrambling far too vulnerable for my tastes-realistic down & dirty street defense. Good to know,naturally,but not something I'd want to pursue further. Great instructional DVD,however.",1249862400,2,393,6.296296296296297
