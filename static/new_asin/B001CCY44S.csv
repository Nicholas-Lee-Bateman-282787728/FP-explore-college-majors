Soon after Melissa dates one of the local boys he ends up dead and local Sheriff Dan Burke played by (Bo Hopkins) begins to investigate.

Will the death of Melissa's date be the only one or is it the first of many to come? Is Melissa the killer or is it just a coincidence the murder happened when she came to town? What secret is Melissa Morgan Hiding? Why is her 16th Birthday so special and will the secret be unveiled in time?  Sorry! You'll have to buy your own copy to find out how it ends.

From Jim Sotos the director who gave us the very graphic and brutal 1975 ""Forced Entry"" comes ""Sweet Sixteen"" from 1983. For some reason this movie doesn't get very much playing time if any and until now it was hard to find. To me the film is pretty much an 80's slasher film with a mix of suspense and horror thrown in. The story and plot as with most of the acting is pretty good in my opinion and I enjoyed seeing this movie again. This movie features a good cast with names that include Bo Hopkins, Patrick MacNee, Susan Strasberg, Larry Storch, and Michael Pataki. I think that the plot has enough twists in it to hold your attention right up until the unexpected ending.

As for the DVD release of ""Sweet Sixteen"" - The Director's Cut, Is it really worth owning? The DVD itself is nicely packaged but the video and sound quality of this new ""Director's Cut"" release from Code Red is a slap in the face to any fan of this movie. The video image is riddled with debris and age related artifacts and it's evident that Code Red didn't spend any money on cleaning up the print for this DVD release. I would rate the video transfer of this DVD release somewhere between bootleg and VHS quality. The sound isn't much better as it contains some hissing and crackling throughout.

DVD Features Include:
-Intro by Scott Spiegel/Aleisa Shirley
-Audio conversation with star Aleisa Shirley and director Jim Sotos at Scott Spiegel's ""den""
-On-camera interview with stars Bo Hopkins and Aleisa Shirley
-Stills gallery
-Theatrical trailer
-Original theatrical version of ""Sweet Sixteen""

The original theatrical version of ""Sweet Sixteen"" is found in the special features section of the DVD. The quality is so poor that there is a disclaimer about the video quality before the movie starts. Unless you're a hard core fan of this movie and have to own it for your collection, I'd recommend renting it first to see what you're getting.",1269648000,12,2761,4.508
3508561,3,B001CCY44S,"Sweet Sixteen (Jim Sotos, 1982)

Jim Sotos--a nom de plume for music video and TV commercial mogul Dimitri Sotirakis--directed only four movies in his long and distinguished career, but all four of them are well-respected by a small, but steadily growing, number of critics and fans. Interestingly, Sotirakis' four movies are all in different genres. Forced Entry was a straight thriller. Hot Moves was a cheap exploitation film. Beverly Hills Brats was a family comedy. And then there is Sweet Sixteen, his entry into the horror genre. It's a pretty basic slasher film with supernatural elements, but Sotirakis' ability to convince pretty big names to appear in his movies, as well as his distinctive directorial style, put Sweet Sixteen above the average level of film coming out during the great slasher film glut of the early eighties.

Melissa (Aleisa Shirley from Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone) and her family have just moved to a small desert town (and we get the feeling this isn't the first time they've moved house in the recent past) that seems quiet on the surface, but has a lingering, nasty racism brewing just beneath the surface. Melissa, being the nave new kid, stumbles into the middle of a confrontation between a Native American man and a high school classmate (which has nothing to do with my plot synopsis, but sets up a lot of stuff later, so pay attention to it) before she and a prospective new boyfriend head off for some alone time. Everything's all well and good until he turns up dead the next morning. This starts a trend, unfortunately, and suspicion falls equally on Melissa and Jason Longshadow (Don Shanks of Halloween 5), the Native American guy I mentioned before. Melissa's father, archaeologist John Morgan (The Avengers' Patrick Macnee), being more civilized than the natives, doesn't believe the red Injun is responsible (since everyone else thinks he is because he's a red Injun) and can't believe his daughter capable of the murders, so he sets out to figure out what's going on before one of them gets lynched.

One of the things that distinguishes Sweet Sixteen from its contemporaries is its examination of racism. Sure, by 1982, film had explored racism before. But in slasher films? Not your typical content. As well, when was the last time you saw Patrick Macnee in a slasher flick? (You never did again, either.) As well, the cast also includes Susan Strasberg (as Melissa's beleaguered mom) and Don Stroud; a pretty heavy cast indeed for an early-eighties movie of any sort not produced by Irwin Allen. While the script (the first--and last--feature-length script by Erwin Goldman) doesn't give the cast a great deal to work with, they do what they can, and make the material seem a bit better tan it actually is. Not too many surprises to be had here, but it's a good, solid slasher flick from the heyday of slasher flicks, and it's been unjustly overlooked in recent years. Rediscover it if you're a fan of the genre; it's worth your while. ***",1243814400,6,3012,4.890410958904109

8286747,4,B001CCY44S,"Not a slasher flick, despite descriptions otherwise.  At best, this could be called a very tepid murder mystery.  Only a few guys are stabbed/killed, at night, in the darkest dark (hit and run so to speak, as they happen so quickly).  Two of the bodies are stumbled upon requiring girls to scream.  It felt like a made-for-TV mystery, especially considering the long list of TV stars involved: Bo Hopkins, Don Stroud, Sharon Farrell, Larry Storch, Susan Strasberg, and the inimitable Patrick (The Avengers) Macnee.  Unfortunately, Sweet 16 is played for laughs a bit too often, thanks to the sheriff's daughter (Dana Kimmell) running around trying to solve the murders.  They also throw in a racial component in an offhand manner when two of the suspects are Native Americans and one is lynched in his home (Henry Wilcoxon as Greyfeather) as a result.

This is by no means a horror movie.  But it has a few good tense moments, and there is Patrick Macnee in a supporting role.  So I liked it in spite of the fact that I was duped into thinking this was an 80s slasher flick, which is what I was hoping for.  Disappointed but obliged to like it anyway as a product of that time.",1429747200,,1177,4.615384615384615
8286748,3,B001CCY44S,"This was slightly different than I was expecting.  I found it to be a bit boring and I wasn't even interested in who the killer was. It was a surprise to me who it was and I found it ridiculous. Too many adults in it and not enough teen interaction. I was expecting the typical lame humor that's found in B movies but there wasn't any to be found in it, which is great. Lead character Melissa is supposed to be fifteen and we got a couple nude scenes with her. The pretty actress who played her, Aleisa Shirley, was actually nineteen when this was filmed in 1982, though someone said it was filmed in 1981, so who knows? The acting was pretty good though I though the girl who played the sheriff's daughter was annoying as heck and overacted slightly. Her brother is the guy who's in the video for Rick Springfield's Jessie's Girl.",1411689600,,831,4.361290322580645
8286749,5,B001CCY44S,"1982's ""Sweet Sixteen"" is somewhere between ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (which was made that same year), and a Nancy Drew murder mystery.  It was directed by Jim Sotos, most known for his mid '70s work ""Forced Entry,"" and features one of the strongest casts of a formulaic teen slasher movie in recent memory.  Along for the ride are screen veterans such as Bo Hopkins, Patrick MacNee and Susan Strasberg.  Thus, with the aforementioned cast and its above-average production values, this one always comes off as a ""real movie,"" unlike some of its no-budget slasher counterparts from around the same time.

Aleisa Shirley (in her screen debut) stars as Melissa, who is a VERY mature-for-her-age (both in appearance and behavior) 15-year-old newcomer to a small Texas town.  Melissa, shall we say, doesn't let her physical lack of years hold her back in the least, as she is known to drink, do drugs, stay out well past curfew, and has a rather casual and promiscuous attitude in choosing sexual partners.  Early on, a drunk, redneck town ruffian takes her to an Indian reservation for a little late night action, only to be stabbed multiple times by an unknown perpetrator.  Melissa in fact becomes the object of desire to all the boys at her new high school, and pretty soon more carnage ensues, with all the guys with the guts to get close enough to her becoming possibilities as the next murder victim.  Sheriff Bo Hopkins and his daughter, played by Dana Kimmell (in the same year she starred in ""Friday the 13th 3-D"") are hot on the trail of the killer throughout the film, and suspicion points to an unsavory Indian at the reservation's burial ground.

Man, did I ever have a lot of fun with this one.  A lot of the appeal and the movie's kinetic energy is carried on the shoulders of Aleisa Shirley, who at 19 was a drop dead gorgeous brunette knockout.  And the scenes of her undressing/showering and even taking a moonlight skinny-dipping on her Sweet 16 birthday (the title occasion and the inspiration for the memorable movie poster/DVD cover) are far from unwelcome.  I also love the shaggy early '80s hairstyles on the boys that lust after her.  The potential boyfriend from her high school that she arranges a date with in a dark back alley, to try and score some ""killer herb,"" looks like he was taken directly from a 1982-era Scorpions concert.  Dana Kimmell also shines in her role as the respectful good girl, just the opposite of Melissa, and the whole cast looks like they had a good time filming this one.  With its arid Texas desert setting, in many ways this film has all the breezy, loose and free-spirited qualities of a sultry summer night.  (I just happen to be viewing and reviewing this on a hot summer night myself, and it never ceases to entertain me, and I've watched it several times since I bought it).

As for the DVD itself, apparently the original master of ""Sweet Sixteen"" was somehow lost to time, and kudos therefore to the good folks at Code Red for rescuing it from certain oblivion and compiling the best surviving film elements into this composite ""Director's Cut.""  While, as other reviewers have stated, the resulting transfer definitely could be better, I in the end found it more than watchable, and the gritty, film-reel quality actually adds a raw, vintage edge to it, making one realize just what a precious commodity this one was to give a digital rebirth to.  Someone seems to now be taking notice, as this 2008 Code Red reissue is already out of print, with remaining copies being snapped up rapidly, and prices increasing by the day.

If you're into slasher films for big-budget splatter effects alone, you are sure to be disappointed.  If however you are looking for a lost treasure from the genre's peak era with an attractive, vibrant cast (not to mention the entertaining theme song ""Melissa"" that is played over and over again on the soundtrack), and more than acceptable direction by Sotos, look no further than ""Sweet Sixteen.""

8286753,3,B001CCY44S,"Put together back in the early 80's this little horror/thriller/slasher film has a lot of impressive parts but fails to really live up to it's potential. Director/Producer Jim Sotos must have pulled a few strings to assemble such a name cast for his little no budget film. Unlike a slew of similar films of the era Sweet Sixteen has a cast of recognizable names. The story is basic and semi plausible .In a small Texas town the new girl in town Melissa played by newcomer Aleisa Shirley is getting the attention of the local boy population. Melissa's dad (Patrick Macnee) is a historian in the area doing a dig looking up Native American artifacts. Her Mom (Susan Strasberg daughter of Lee ) is from the area originally and knows the local sheriff (Bo Hopkins) who has a daughter and a son who are Melissa's age and go to the local high school. Melissa has traveled with her over protective parents around the country and is more worldly than the local kids. She's also quite attractive and not afraid to flaunt it. Boys and men start to come onto young Melissa much to the chagrin of her parents and local girls like Marci(Dana Kimmell) the sheriff's daughter. Nothing seems out of the ordinary until the first guy she dates (Don Stroud) turns up dead in the desert with multiple stab wounds. The new girl is suspected but no real concrete evidence can place Melissa as the killer so she's free to go. Then another boy is going to meet with Melissa after hours but is promptly dispatched in a similar vein. This time both Melissa and an old Indian man (Henry Wilcoxon) find the boy dead in an alley. Again things point to Melissa being a killer but there's no hard proof. And the locals also have a resentment of the local Indians and try to blame the killings on the old mans son. The son works for Melissa's dad at the site and earlier had an altercation with the guy Melissa went out with. The film is quite clumsy in trying to weave these story lines together which drags the film down a notch. So we are left with a few dead bodies, a runaway suspect,some deep secrets that the town would like to forget and Melissa's 16th birthday party. The films not very gory,not very scary and you should be able to guess the real killer before the sheriff does. The cast is amazing considering the low budget feel and obvious corners being cut. MacNee is a tv legend and veteran actor who's great as the Dad. Bo Hopkins did a slew of big films like American Graffiti and a some smaller ones and is still active today in his 70's. Strasberg's father Lee practically invented modern acting techniques and Susan did a lot of work until her death. Dana Kimmell was the star of Friday the 13th part 3 and did Lone Wolf McQuade as well and was a tv actress until the early 90's. Others like Don Stroud and Henry Wilcoxon have long resumes with Wilcoxon's going back to the 30's. Heck even F Troop's Larry Storch pops in for a cameo. As for Melissa star Aleisa Shirley in her first film wasn't asked to do much but did fine with what was asked of her. Mainly she had to act like a teenager in a new town who resents her parents and show some gratuitous nudity as well. As a interesting footnote of the 80's slasher craze Sweet Sixteen is a passable nights viewing. But sadly if the story was better and tighter this could have been a cult classic.",1328140800,3,3335,4.4332247557003255
