8700952,5,B00T8N8KA2,"Very beautiful and well-acted film about a psychologist trying to convince his deathbed laden father of his newfound and remarkable theory.  An fascinating sort of role reversal is carried out with the real-life psychologist playing the father.  Elements of comedy, drama, and adventure are interwoven nicely in this film complete with the right choice of music to set the mood as well as superb choreography which make it very exciting to watch for many times over.  Being able to relate to the characters in this film while catching a glimpse of a theory that could revolutionize the entire university should be a MUST SEE for everyone.  I think that I have found one of my favorite films of all time!",1487894400,,703,4.833333333333333
