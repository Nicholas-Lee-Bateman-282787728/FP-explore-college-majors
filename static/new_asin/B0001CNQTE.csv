1986783,5,B0001CNQTE,"As a former Protestant, I have heard many derogatory comments and misconceptions about what I believe as a Catholic.  I love this video because both men are willing to listen to the other without disagreeing or debating their beliefs.  It's an open, honest conversation where both men respect each other's faith traditions.  Although it does not address every single misconception that Protestants have about Catholic beliefs, it hits many of the big ones, such as Mary, Confession, and Salvation.  Both Catholics and Protestants would benefit and learn so much by watching this with an open heart.",1199664000,15,598,5.197916666666667
1986784,4,B0001CNQTE,"This was a good movie, with some depth to it.  Fer loses his teaching position in Buenos Aires, and he is trying to figure out how to be productive, and solvent, from that point on.  His wife, Liliana, keeps him directed, or at least tries to, while balancing a difficult relationship with their son Pedro and his family in Spain.

I found Fer to be pompous, wedded to a leftist philosophy that no longer has relevance, and just not very likable.  His son left the country because he realized how autocratic and arbitrary life could be with the political problems that seem to plague Argentina . . . continually.  His father seemed to go out of his way to berate his son for leaving his home country, but could offer no alternative.

This movie drives one to evaluate one's own life, and what is most important.",1193529600,,811,4.52054794520548
1986785,5,B0001CNQTE,"The first time I saw this on TV, I was so absorbed, that I attempted to stay awake long enough to see it in its entirety. It didn't start until midnight on a local Christian channel, and I just couldn't quite make it. When I found it on Amazon, I ordered it immediately, and so should you!! Every Catholic and Protestant should see this movie. Father John Riccardo does a beautiful job of answering all questions and addresses many misconceptions about the Catholic Church. If we could all reach this level of understanding, there would be much more acceptance and love toward one another as we are commanded to do by Our Lord.",1193529600,14,627,4.557522123893805
1986786,4,B0001CNQTE,"LUGARES COMUNES (Common Ground) is yet another sensitive Argentinean film that has the courage to deal with the bumpy political life of Argentina as well as the equally rocky road to aging.  Based on the novel by Lorenzo F. Aristarain and directed by Adolfo Aristarain this is a film of sunlight and shadows - and those clouds that promise to unveil the sun despite passing darkness.

Fernando Robles (Federico Luppi) is a writer and university professor in Buenos Aires who is informed before his planned trip to Madrid to visit his son Pedro (Carlos Santamara) and daughter-in-law Natacha (Valentina Bassi) that he is being placed in early retirement: the crumbling government of Argentina cannot support such things as education!  After an exquisite farewell of sage advice to his students on what is important in the role of a teacher, he goes home to his loving wife of many years Liliana (Mercedes Sampietro) to prepare for their journey to Madrid.  At the airport Liliana senses sadness in Fernando and he confesses that he has been 'fired', that they have little money to live on in Buenos Aires: he covers his sadness by buying Liliana perfumes she loves.  This couple is bonded so beautifully it makes us weep.

In Madrid the couple is forced to stay with the son and daughter but the closeness of this familial proximity is intolerable when Fernando informs his son of his financial situation.  Pedro is cold and harsh and is in life for money yet insists on assisting his parents. The couple leaves, returning to Argentina where they under advice from lawyer Carlos (Arturo Puig) sell their home and move to the country where they plan to grow lavender - a return to the purity of the land.  But fate intervenes and the story ends in a manner that leaves the viewer sad but wiser.

The cast is sterling and the direction is first rate.  This is one of those films that should be required viewing for many reasons, but especially for people who are approaching the time of retirement and the fear that holds.  Highly recommended for a large viewing audience.  In Spanish with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, December 06",1165190400,5,2130,4.802739726027397
1986787,1,B0001CNQTE,"Like most Aristarain's films, this one goes nowhere plot-wise. It is also peppered with presumptuous ranting and gratuitous, artificial dialogue, much in Aristarain's style. The actors make a very professional effort in trying to put some life in the starchy script and slow plot, but not even the skill of Luppi can prevent the movie from stopping dead when his character is forced give speeches on every utterance.

  A waste of acting talent, Spanish money and my time.",1149120000,,472,5.0256410256410255
1986788,5,B0001CNQTE,"Filmmaker Adolfo Aristarain and actor Federico Luppi have collaborated quite a few times over the years. Always wonderful movies, always superb acting. Lugares Comunes is precisely that: a wonderful movie with superb acting. The usual Aristarain/Luppi fare. It is a quiet movie, a movie for those who like ideas, a movie to be watched and watched over and over again. A true masterpiece.

1986878,5,B0001CNQTE,"A review of the DVD entitled ""Common Ground: What Protestants and Catholics Can Learn From Each Other"",  2006 Kensington Community Church, &  2007 Niniveh's Crossing

  I just saw this DVD for the second time, together with three persons who saw it for the first time, my wife and another Catholic couple, during our parish's celebration of the 2009 Week of Prayer for Christian Unity. This is an interview of Fr. John Riccardo of the St. Anastasia Catholic Church, north of Detroit, by the Rev. Steve Andrews, Lead Pastor of the Kensington Community Church, a nearby evangelical megachurch.  The topics touched upon include salvation, the Eucharist, prayer and worship, Mary and the saints, confession, evangelization, and reaching across denominational lines.
  About one hour into the video, the impact of the presentation was so profound, that both of us men in our 70's, had tears in our eyes. We were all touched by the true love both of these ministers had for God, their sincere desire for truth, and the mutual respect and love they displayed for each other. Fr. Riccardo is so effective in the interview because he came across as a truly ""authentic"" person, besides being quite grounded in Sacred Scripture which he uses to back up every facet of Catholic belief and practice. This is why ""over 2,000 copies of the interview on DVD were sold through the Kensington Church's bookstore"" in the few weeks after its release. (Stan Williams, [...] 2006). This fact is so very encouraging, as I believe this DVD is the single most effective video presenting the Catholic faith tradition and practice to other Christian communities and anybody who wants to learn more about what Catholics believe.
  I hope that by the time we celebrate the 102nd Week of Prayer for Christian Unity in January 2010, thousands of church programs, and millions of persons yearning for Christian Unity with a sincere heart would have seen this video, and hold discussion groups about it. It certainly should be viewed by mixed audiences with both Catholics and Protestants together. Furthermore, I strongly recommend this video to all public and liberal arts college libraries for its intrinsic value of liberating the mind from preconceptions and misconceptions about the Catholic faith and traditions, besides libraries and bookstore of all Christian churches.

1986879,5,B0001CNQTE,"With candor and charity, a Roman Catholic Father expounds upon the faith through an interview by a Protestant minister.  The love the two men have for one another is apparent in this refreshing, inviting, and educational exchange.  A must see for anyone interested in what Catholic and Protestant hold in common without the sellout of either side.  Perfect unity may be elusive so long as the differences are significant but charity and understanding short of that perfect communion can still be accomplished to a small degree.  We can praise God for small yet significant victories in understanding.

Father Riccardo's responses to Pastor Andrews' queries are revealing, theologically sound, charitable, and yet without compromise.  The charity of these two men is profound and enlightening.  The love and respect they have for one another is worth the price of the video in itself.  The Protestant/Catholic differences are significant and cannot be ignored yet we must learn to deal with those differences without hateful polemic and begin to understand one another in charity and mutual respect as human beings.

The world has seen a divided church for too long and for too long we have busied ourselves more with flinging accusations at one another rather than seeking to undermine the work of the other.  Our differences are indeed significant and cannot be compromised but they will only be resolved in seeking truth and understanding where ever it leads.  This video is not yet another touchy/feely unity-at-any-cost ecumenical siren - this is a call for unity through real understanding based on an objective search for truth.  Unity can never be placed as a goal above objective truth and these two men of faith have given us the keys to finding a form of unity that will not sacrifice the search for truth.  Very praiseworthy and enlightening.  Perfect for small group studies and personal education.  A must have.",1214092800,14,1924,5.10223642172524

I have witnessed too many debates that has the Protestant railing away at the Catholic about false and useless complaints.  Protestants and Catholics have heard too many myths and ""fake news"" from people who are either uninformed or afraid.  This video should be seen by all Catholics and Protestants to understand that we are all on the same side; in love with Jesus Christ.
