7902566,5,B000003K62,"Worf takes Alexander to a Klingon outpost so the boy can observe their cultural heritage up close and personal.  However, that night three assassins attack them.  They survive in part because of the actions of K'Mtar, an adviser to the House of Mogh.  When K'Mtar shows Worf that the knife of the assassin bears the symbol of the House of Duras.  While the Enterprise begins looking for the Duras sisters, K'Mtar tries to inspire Alexander to become a warrior.  But, as always, the boy resists the idea.  However, when confronted with the evidence the Duras sisters not only deny they were involved in the assassination plot, they point out that the knife bears not only the symbol of the House of Duras, but the mark of Lursa's son.  The twist is that Lursa only recently became pregnant.  That would mean the knife produced by K'Mtar, comes from the future...
After several less than stellar stories involving Worf's Klingon heritage and his problems raising Alexander, ""Firstborn"" gets down to the basics.  At long last, Worf, the only Klingon in Starfleet, recognizes the uniqueness of his son and finally grants him the right to follow his own destiny, no matter what the cost (apparently Alexander wants to a diplomatic peace-maker).  Given all the time it has taken for this obvious idea to get through Worf's thick skull (it has all those bony ridges), this was a nice payoff to resolving that particular sub-plot.  It was also nice to see an episode that makes subtle but appropriate use of time travel.  An excellent final STNG ""Klingon"" episode.",988156800,,1556,4.8522727272727275
