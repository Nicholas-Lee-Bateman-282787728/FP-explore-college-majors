2295872,4,B0009K1ZHS,"The only problems were that Stratas was old and didn't sound her best, and the occasional audibleness of the prompter.  Everyone else sounds great.",1133222400,,147,5.125
2295873,5,B0009K1ZHS,"This double bill production of Tabarro Pagliacci is one of the great operatic experiences of the past several decades and must be purchased and experienced.

  Tabarro may be my favorite of Puccini's operas.  It is innovative and daring, holding your attention for every second.  The orchestra is used ambiently, there are tugs going off, songs and lovers and all sorts of passers-by giving context to the action.  The music bespeaks the most profound modernist melancholy.  Subdued angst marks the entire opera, which bursts forth in the ecstasy of love, in terror, rage and finally in vengance.  There is a magic about the score which underlines the action.

  This opera, being so ambient, is almost completely on the shoulders of the performers.  The opera will either fail or succed on the stregnth of the singing actors employed, and here there are only the best.

  Juan pons is the Michelle.  This charachter may be one of the great baritone charachters in all opera.  Not evil by any means, Michelle is honestly loving, tortured by Giorgetta and her distance.  He has sunk into paranoia and melancholy.  His gentle melancholy slowly turns into fury, after bearing his soul to Giorgetta pleading with her, to ""come close and rest by him, for the night is beautiful."" (some of the most beautiful baritone writing ever done.)  Juan Pons is a fabulous Michele, he is a big gruff man, the exact type needed.  His voice, although as always lacking in warmth, has the power to express Michelles frustrated rage, and the beauty to express his romantic melancholy.

  Domingo plays Luigi.  At the age of 55 he is still the great romantic lead.  No other tenor could do what he did.  He was madly in love with Giorgetta.  When he dances that out of tune waltz with her, your heart tears in two.  I watched this production with four friends, and at the finish of ""Hai Ben Ragione"" we were one and all in tears.  Domingo is in strong voice, and he uses his full range, from ringing desperation to sotto voce angst.

  Teresa Stratas makes her farewell in the part of Giorgetta.  Forget that she is 60 years old, her voice is still there, and she is still the greatest singing actress alive.  Her giorgetta is consumed by lust, meloncholy and  remorse.  she really feels bad for her silent, brooding husband, and  her tears are real when Michelle pleads with her.

  BRAVO!!!!!!!

  Next to Tabarro comes comes the inevitable Pagliacci, which was also spectacular.  Pavarotti delivers a clown of real force.  This is one of his finest acted performaces to date.  Vesti la Giubba will truly move you to tears.  Pons is a wonderful Tonio, a man truly deformed.  His voice is ideal, shouty and intense.  his interactions with Stratas are true verismo, with spit and blood to spare. Dwane Croft is an incredible sounding lover for Stratas.

  Teresa Stratas, perhaps a touch less secure than in Tabarro, is still a memorable and incredible Nedda.  Her attention to the drama, makes a work that is sometimes charachture into something dramatically convincing.

  I don't cry very often, but I cried at this....

Tabarro: orchestra A, singing A, set B, acting B, costumes A, except for Giorgietta, which I would rate a D (Who would wear heels on a barge?), lighting B, English subtitles D.

Pagliacci:  orchestra A, singing A, set A, acting A, costumes A, lighting A, English subtitles B.

Bottom line:  Get this DVD for the Pag.  As for Tab, I am not familiar with the La Scala production referred to here by another reviewer; but my personal favorite is the one with Amarilli Nizza done in Modena.",1373673600,2,696,4.617886178861789
2295877,4,B0009K1ZHS,"I Capuleti e i Montecchi is yet another wonderful opera by Bellini.  There are plenty of beautiful melodies throughout, and it stands along side of his other famous works as one not to be missed.

The production by the Ravenna Festival is a fine one, with nice costumes and clever scenery (projected imagery superimposed as a backdrop, and sometimes in the foreground as well).  It's not in the league with high budget productions like one would find at The Met or Royal Opera House, but it suffices and doesn't diminish the experience.

Valentina Farcas (as Giulietta) and Paola Gardina (as Romeo) perform admirably, although the supporting male singers are merely adequate.

The video quality is not much below what I've come to expect from contemporary opera dvds, but it's OK ... audio quality is of similar quality, dolby 5.1 option - no DTS - but good enough.

I haven't seen the Patrizia Ciofi / Martina Franca Festival version yet, and that's fine ... maybe someday, but until then, this production is good enough - Bellini's wonderful melodies take center stage and the minor shortcomings with this offering do not detract.

6 - 2 - 2013 update : I keep enjoying this performance more and more, and watching it a little bit more than my four other Bellini operas.

Still, four stars though ... I wish the chapters began at the start of all the arias I like, rather than sometimes a minute or two into the chapter ... Oh well ... And the picture doesn't fill the entire screen without manually adjusting the TVs picture size setting, although it seems to be in the 16:9 ratio rather than the old school 4:3

And again, the projected imagery is a clever, effective, and efficient way to add scenery to the stage.",1351728000,3,1719,4.703333333333333
2295878,5,B0009K1ZHS,"I really just bought this for I Pagliacci, so that is what I am going to review for it. This is an opera that I have watched several times since buying it, and listened to it on record numerous times. Mr. Pavarotti does an AMAZING job in this, and the praise I am going to give really does no justice. He does a fantastic job displaying emotions through music, watching and hearing him singing Vesti la Giubba will literally put tears in your eyes. You can really feel his pain in the inability to get out of his fate. What else can I say that hasn't been said? By far one of my favorite operas performed by one of operas greats, a definite must have.

I feel I should say this, too. Il Tabarro is a great treat to have with this, but I think that I Pagliacci really outshines it. Of course, that is entirely my opinion, so I hope that does not offend anyone who thinks the contrary!

So, in summary, definitely buy this and enjoy BOTH of these fantastic performances, you won't regret it.",1326240000,6,989,4.283422459893048
2295879,2,B0009K1ZHS,"...alas, it's true.

I was so looking forward to see this production for two reasons - first, this coming season we'll have ""I Capuleti e i Montecchi"" performed by Opera Boston, and I wanted to see other productions beforehand.

Second, I have in the past enjoyed the recording of June 6, 1966 (!!!) on CD set with Claudio Abbado conducting Teatro Communale in Bologna, Giulietta by Margherita Rinaldi, Romeo by Giacomo Aragall and Tebaldo by Luciano Pavarotti.  The singing there, with such a cast, is just out of this world, and the music flowed so beautifully.  Thus I expected something of the same from a relatively modern performance on DVD, plus coming from a splendid city of Justinian and Theodora, a city adorned with marvelous monuments as befits the glorious Capital of the Byzantine Empire.

Alas, this spectacle is quite disappointing.  First, the singing is adequate for females and just below that for males, meaning especially Tebaldo (Giacomo Patti).  Giulietta (Valentina Farcas) sings nicely but her voice is too monochromatic; Romeo (Paola Gardina) sounds perhaps the most robust of them all.

Overall the mis-en-scene is another extreme of a national aestethical preference - if German-speaking nations like to take a deliberately rough and often deconstructing approach to old operas, distorting, humiliating, mocking and perverting every sublime feeling, aspect or idea of old masters, Italians revel in keeping the tradition too much, and the result is often an overly sentimental, sugary, syropy show, devoid of any challenge to the original interpretation.  I think, based on reading Stendhal and Glinka, admirers of Bellini, Donizetti, Rossini, that such a production is actually very appropriate to convey the spirit of operas by those composers and the ways they was staged then, when aforementioned artists wrote openly that the whole opera house was sobbing, and they themselves were weeping profusely.

The only issue is that times have changed and productions like this produce an effect of a tear-jerker, only that they fail to squeeze tears.  These fogs, projections of sweet images, fadings in and out and so on are viewed as tired cinematographic tricks, devoid of any novelty or invention.

The story itself is appropriately such an outrageous sacrilege of Shakespeare - the whole spirit of Shakespeare, that is, of a rebellion of youth and love against the repression and confinement of brutal family tradition, camouflaged as law and honor, is ruined.  Here we have, in the victorious bourgeoisie spirit of the time (1830) a meek and week Giulietta, so timid and fearful, afraid to leave her father's house, speaking of law and duty - so much that with astonishment one finds oneself doubting if this is a Juliet we all know and love.  This distortion of the story seems to fit a peculiar theme in Italian opera of that time, reminding of another opera, a recent Boston production of Donizetti's ""Maria Padilla"" - also a prolonged overbearing scene of a daughter begging for father's forgiveness, made a centerpiece of the opera.  It seems that either the composers were particularly drawn to this very strange theme - a week innocent woman who exalts devotion to her father above all - or it was a fashionable ideal in Italian society of that time.

It is a historic fact that the libretto by Felice Romani was a reworking of the story of Romeo and Juliet for an opera by Nicola Vaccai called Giulietta e Romeo. This was based on Italian sources rather than taken directly from Shakespeare.  However, the raping of Shakespeare is just too much, and it feels much more painful in a visual DVD than on a recording, where one can channel the senses into enjoying bel canto singing by splendid voices, as on the aforementioned CD with Aragall/Pavarotti.

Bellini wrote the opera for the 1830 Carnival season at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice,  and the premiere was on 11 March 1830.
One interesting aspect of this opera is that the role of Romeo marked the end of roles written for a castrato in operatic history, together with the role of Orsini in Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia, conspicuously written only 3 years later in 1833.

Music-wise, it is pleasant but as any music without counterpoint it starts tiring the listener after a while;  even Norma becomes heavy to listen after two hours, and this one turns so repetitive in its musical forms and methods that starts sounding tedious even earlier.  It is written in the Italian style of those years, but Bellini lacks Rossini's smile and lustre, plus the too blatant violation of a beloved story of inseparable lovers spurning oppressive family and society is just too much to take.

Given the woeful production and mediocre singing, I can't truly tell a good story and recommend this performance, unless you must see a version of ""I Capuleti e i Montecchi"".  It can, however, sound quite beautiful if the voices are glorious, so you can try Aragall/Pavarotti recording, or Netrebko/Garanca on YouTube to compare for yourself.",1312156800,2,5018,5.018072289156627

2295881,3,B0009K1ZHS,"I like this production very much!  The gals are better singers than the guys, which is okay because they are supposed to be; they are, after all, the leads.  The opera itself is almost a study in stasis, despite the music Bellini provides for variety of action and concomitant emotions, but the constant changing of projections indicates the shifts of forces among and around these two young lovers.  Those projections, based on works by Carpaccio (about whom I wish more had been explained in the info that comes with the packaging of the dvd), are indeed iconographic and comment thoroughly on the plight of the lovers and explain why they are doomed.  Consequently, the production has to be taken on its own terms, and, as such, allowed to explore the depths of the opera as something to be experienced on a number of levels.  I think that the production is a fine collaboration between the director, the set and lighting designers, and the musicians.

  Why then do I give it only three instead of five stars as a rating?  Because I need to have the subtitles before me, at least for the first three or four viewings.  I know that a lot of the meaning lies in the projections, but I need those subtitles, and, despite my experience with many dvds of operas, still can't get at those subtitles!  I've given this dvd to people who are far more mechanically-minded than I, but they can't find them either.  Last of all, I can't play the dvd on Playstation 3; being an old man, I need that sharpness and clarity both to see and hear as much as I can!  If you have a solution, please let me know it.  Help, please!

  CORRECTION: As one of the introductory titles indicates, the icons are the subtitles, which would be fine if we were one of the few during the Late Middles Ages and Early Renaissance who knew what they were and meant.  For example, knowing what the falling leaves, from what kind of tree they come, and their color and size means during the first act of the duet of the lovers increases the significance of the characters AND audiences' experience enormously.  Therefore I increase my star rating of this production from 3 to 4.  But do the makers of the dvd want to sell it or not?  Come on, give us those subtitles!",1264204800,11,2234,4.507462686567164
2295882,5,B0009K1ZHS,"This is one of the best productions of an opera I've seen in a long time. I've heard before that Pavarotti was a bad actor. This dvd does not support that at all, I recommend anyone that has doubts go to youtube and look up some scenes from this dvd. The Puccini piece was also very nice, and had some interesting harmonies!",1259539200,3,324,4.241935483870968
2295883,5,B0009K1ZHS,"This Pagliacci is unsurprising in that it is all that one would hope for. Old War Horse, or not, a decent cast can make it effective; a cast like this shows why it has been so successful for so many years. On the other hand, Il Tabarro, surprised me with its impact; as one reviewer recognized, it is a musical version of many of the films and plays of the thirties and early forties, working class drama, in which hard-working, ordinary people, find themselves the material of Greek tragedy. No better argument against minimalist staging of drama can be made than the atmosphere created by the Met scenic design which with deceptive simplicity makes a major contribution to the success of the production. Puccini's music amazed me with its sheer rightness for the simple love triangle so often portrayed yet made fresh and vital here. Finally, and most importantly, Conductor Levine leads three perfectly cast principals to give of their best, which is some of the best singing of its day. Stratas shows that even without singing she could step into the role on Broadway and be a hit; with her wonderfully expressive singing, she creates a memorable character despite the limited time available. Pons, too, in every respect commands respect for his portrayal. As to Domingo, his ability to enter into the most variegated roles is by now legend; here, he, too, looks, acts, sings with near perfection to make us believe in his tragic love.
Needless to say, I can recommend both these short operas, without qualification. The Pagliacci will live up to expectations, the Il Tabarro will exceed them.",1253232000,5,1597,4.875
2295884,5,B0009K1ZHS,"This is my favorite production of Tabarro, one of my Puccini favorites.  I saw this when it was first broadcast and a wonderful new surprise was Graves Frugola who gets the singing honors.  Too many Tabarros are just too bright.  This one verges on murky....very suitably grey.  Stratas is a bit long in the tooth but well worth watching for master emoting and she still summons up some impressive singing (tho a bit rough in lower notes).  I am no Domingo fan but this is one of his better singing efforts.  His acting is passable, but not exciting.  Pons is totally miscast.  Michele commits double murder in a fit of rage and we need a voice with sharp intensity.  Pons is too soft in voice and also is no actor.
  If you've never seen this little masterpiece this is a good version to start with.

As I can't tolerate Pav my review stops here.  I could only get thru this Pagliacci once because of him.",1247011200,4,906,4.418181818181818
2295885,2,B0009K1ZHS,"l'id&eacute;e &eacute;tait originale : Pagliacci sans Cavalleria, mais avec Puccini. Paris et les quais de la Seine ne d&eacute;bouchent sur rien : hauts murs qui cachent le ciel et aucune issue en perspective, alors que Zeffirelli campe ses Paillasses dans une r&eacute;gion minable de la campagne italienne. Ce sont les hommes qui triomphent, ils sont jaloux et se m&eacute;fient des (de La) femme. Pauvre Teresa Stratas, elle avait eu son heure de gloire, avec la Lulu de Berg-Boulez (Op&eacute;ra de Paris 1979) et la Traviata de ce mme Zeffirelli.

2295886,5,B0009K1ZHS,"It looks like I can't get enough of Pagliacci; I own three of them now. It's the universal appeal, since most of us have had to deal with a love lost - and frankly, we were pretty angry, if we were honest. Thankfully, most of us didn't go completly nuts.
The music is wonderful - a sort of mad stagger between farce, exhultation, strange, then stumbling into eerie - then as suddenly, jerking back to opera buffo. James Levine conducts superbly, the orchestra is perfection. Art direction by Levine also luridly opulent and joyous -great color! -scenes interspersed with some extraordinary  choral and vocal work - each performer deserving standing ovations. I was very impressed with Kenn Chester who played the affable Arlechin (harlequin ). superb- and I hope to see him in more, absolutely ! But you know who steals the show? Who eats the scenery, as it is called? Juan Pons ! This is his opera. At first, we buy an opera, because it may have the big name star - and certainly you want to own this one with the late, wonderful Pavarotti. In this one, however, Juan Pons is unmistakeably the master of ceremonies. Before I thought of him as best supporting actor. Now, as I hear more of him, more closely now, I have to admire his voice. Don't overlook his mastery of baritone bel canto. It's easy to find a collection of favorite arias by the big names...but it would be fabulous to listen to Mr. Pons do a CD/DVD in concert. I would buy that now in a minute. What a voice. In this show, Juan is the show.",1189641600,8,1509,4.467391304347826

2295888,3,B0009K1ZHS,"Talk about an example of a stage director not having faith in the beautiufl music of this opera.  The scene changes never stop even during the revashing arias and duets.  Something is always moving, going up or down, panels sliding on and off the stage, projections constantly fading and appearing on the back scrim,images superimposed on top of each other, stairs appearing and disappearing, the harp player sitting on the flight of steps, the clarinet player in a tree - well, you get the picture (plus!) It's too bad because you keep losing focus on the wonderful voices and melodies of this opera.  Minnesota Opera did this work a few years ago and I don't remmebr being as impressed by the music as I was on this DVD.  i also had to keep adjusting my volune, bass and treble controls.  The sound is flat and at times it sounds like a Met broadcast from 1955.  There is also a visual problem on the long shots which tend to be blury.  This opera doesn't work for me having the part of Romeo sung by a female.  This is too much of a classic love story, thanks to Shakespeare, and doesn't lend itself to gender bending even though the two women's voices - Valentina Farcas & Paola Gardina -  blend very nicely and their duets are breath taking.  Cudos also to the rest of the cast and to conductor Pietro Mianiti and the Ravenna forces.  In case you haven't noticed, this is a mixed - bittersweet review.  I loved the music and singing and tried not to be distracted by the rest.  This opera deserves a first rate DVD presentation which this is not.",1162166400,8,1551,4.457446808510638
2295889,5,B0009K1ZHS,"In what has to be considered an inspired pairing, the Met opened its 1994 season with this double bill, recorded here for posterity. Il Tabarro and Pagliacci, though by different composers, belong together, since both are relatively short verismo tragedies, both feature indigent and tawdry characters, and both deal with infidelity and murder.

The evening starts with Puccini's Il Tabarro, the more low key outing of the two. It's typical of Puccini to be less interested in telling a complex story and more interested in creating a convincing sense of atmosphere, of place, and of eliciting strong emotions, all through his wonderful music, and he succeeds brilliantly. From the serene opening to its violent climax, Il Tabarro is filled with the brooding tension of its unhappy characters. The Met's dark, yet lovely, production works wonders toward bringing this tension to life, as do the singers. A scowling Placido Domingo is Luigi, the strong itinerant workhorse willing to risk everything, even to kill for his one outlet of happiness, his love for his boss's wife, played by Teresa Stratas. Domingo still sounds great, even youthful, his ardor is always legitimate because that's the type of singer he is. Physically, he isn't nearly as handsome as he was in, say, Rigoletto from fifteen years earlier, he looks a little like a more smoldering Lon Chaney Jr. at this point, but this actually ends up being a plus, his age adds a craggy, wounded look to his features that works, even though he is clearly much older than the character he is portraying. Stratas' voice isn't quite as strong as it was ten years earlier, when she was capturing the powerhouse roles of Violetta and Lulu and Salome to perfection, even with the pristine sound quality of this production she has trouble maintaining a consistency in volume, but if she was intentionally trying to save herself for the big moments, well, the strategy worked, because Stratas always manages to deliver when it really counts. To her credit, her voice rarely sounds strained, the purity of sound is still there even if isn't always as full or as forceful as it used to be. Juan Pons, the betrayed husband Michele, is a gentle yet threatening bear of a man, his singing is tender and passionate but also simmering with rage which the audience just knows is destined to come to the surface before the story is over; he gives a dynamite performance, appropriately enough, he is the last to make his curtain call and gets the strongest ovation. Il Tabarro is far from Puccini's greatest opera, but it is a work to be treasured, with its emphasis on the life and feelings of poor folk living and working by the Seine over the story itself, it functions as a chilling mood piece, and proves that this often underrated composer could do whatever he wanted, he was creatively diverse, he had a brain in addition to a heart.

Leoncavallo's Pagliacci is one of the greatest masterworks of the verismo genre, more hultihued musically and dramatically than Il Tabarro, which the Met emphasizes with a colorful and crowded production(but not too colorful or too crowded, it is just right). Pavarotti is Canio the tormented clown and one of the most complex protagonists in all versimo, his voice is clear and piercing as ever and his performance really gets to the violent heart of the murderous cuckold, he manages to match Domingo in the acting department, rarely has the singer come across as so, well, vicious. Yet his Vesti la giubba shows the sadness of the character and lives up to what you would expect from a tenor of his stature performing one of opera's most popular numbers. He even takes a curtain call for that one aria(and nobody takes a curtain call like Pavarotti). Stratas returns as Nedda, another wayward wife(was she trying to tell us something?), and she is once again on for the big moments, especially her glorious aria which taxes her voice, nevertheless she manages to break through and topple the house. Juan Pons also returns as Tonio, his prelude(""I am the prologue"") is delivered with panache, and his portrayal of the deformed comprimario plays up the lechery and resentment over the heartbreak with disturbing results. His voice is, of course, smooth and clear and boiling with hate. Dwaye Croft has the ideal sort of romantic baritone voice for Silvio. The complexity of Leoncavallo's ""true"" story, with its play within a play(a commedia del arte piece, the narrative of which cleverly matches the surrounding events) and the confusion of fantasy and reality yield all sorts of brilliant action from the chorus and players, the stage is never less than thrillingly alive.

Special accolades should be given to the performances of James Levine and the mighty Met orchestra, who bring out the tragedy, the humor, most of all the passion of both scores while never failing to miss the equally important moments of pensiveness and quiet. Verismo has never sounded better.",1159401600,19,4955,4.917562724014337
2295890,5,B0009K1ZHS,"This is an absolutely wonderful performance of Bellini's opera, at the famed Ravenna festival. Overall a moving and very beautiful interpretation. The stars are undoubtedly the two ladies. Both are great singers, but I think Gardina as Romeo is the better actress. Also, Farcas overdoes her coloratura just a little. Tagliavini's Tebaldo is also good, though his voice is a little thin at the high notes. The other singers have minor roles but are all good. The orchestra and conducting is great. Splendid costumes. The scene is pleasing, but a bit confusing at times, and its in no way a big irritation like other modern productions nowadays.

2295892,4,B0009K1ZHS,"These two verismo opera performances more or less define what the Met has traditionally represented:  Huge, colorful, even dwarfing stagings surrounding singers of great international renown.  As a double-bill gala opening for the 1994 season, this DVD offers the Met's cream of the crop for an evening of flaring passions.

Il Tabarro has often been the ugly stepsister in Puccini's Trittico, although, if properly staged, as this production is, it can be even more moving than Suor Angelica, while exhibiting a much subtler and more advanced musical fabric.  The design/directorial team of David Reppa and Fabrizio Melano has created a vivid Paris that nearly smells of croissants, with storefronts, cobblestone streets, high embankments, and a large barge on the Seine, where the tragic love triangle plays out.

As Giorgetta, the padrona, Teresa Stratas looks extremely haggard and wears a reddish fright wig (even though the libretto mentions that she is a blonde).  She uses every molecule of her anorexic body to deliver this tricky role's high notes with real power and a minimum of squall.  Unfortunately, much of the role lies in the lower part of her voice, straddling an audible break that produces some rather gutteral sounds.  Normally an unparalleled actress, Stratas is far too manic and jittery here, making it all too easy for her husband Michele to guess that she is unfaithful.

As her secret lover Luigi, Placido Domingo makes a strapping (and somewhat paunchy) stevedore, and is in fine vocal form, keeping the bravado in check to play his role credibly.  His swagger, his confidence, and his tender reminiscing on life in the suburbs are all artfully delineated.

The real revelation of this performance, though, is Juan Pons as the padrone Michele, a huge bear of a man, as threatening as he is gentle, as vengeful as he is pitiable.  Pons mines every nuance of this fascinating role, and finds the right vocal shadings through volume and placement in order to create something truly original.  That his sound is often less than polished only works in his favor here.

As La Frugola, the glorious Florence Quivar shines, a true case of star casting in a minor role.  Federico Davia as her husband Il Tapa looks a bit old for his part, but has a real rapport with his wife and is quite nimble on the stage.  Charles Anthony as the alcoholic Il Tinca is a fitting archetype of a man destroyed by his wife's infidelity, almost like a ghost of the future Michele.  Levine and the Met orchestra control pacing, dynamics, color and phrasing to achieve maximum musical and emotional effect, making this performance one of their most satisfying on DVD.

Returning after intermission to Leoncavallo's I Pagliacci, we have a Zeffirelli production that is rather modest by his standards, and therefore attractive.  Teresa Stratas plays the itinerant actress Nedda, who this time is caught in a love quadrangle, not only including her bourgeois lover Silvio and her clown husband Canio, but the hunchbacked clown Tonio as well.  Stratas seems relaxed and renewed after the intermission, wears a much more becoming wig, and rarely has to reach for notes.  She is fantastic in the range of things she must do in this role, from dancing to whipping to a wonderfully accomplished pantomime during the play-within-a-play.  If I find her a bit TOO brutal in her treatment of Tonio when he declares his love, it may be just my own sensitivity.

Juan Pons is the hunchback Tonio without the hump.  Evidently Zeffirelli felt that the physical hump would be superfluous, emphasizing instead Pons's physical girth, along with vocal color, makeup and movement to suggest his twisted nature.  Pons delivers a forceful Prologue, but somehow I always hear Robert Merrill in this scene, which puts Pons at a disadvantage.  However, Pons masterfully turns lovesickness into revenge, guiding our emotions from pity to disgust in a nicely arched portrayal.

Pavarotti as Canio is the weakest link here...he wouldn't know an emotion if it slammed into him at 60mph.  He works as a monolith on the stage, a tangent to the drama and to the activity, rather than being an organic part of them.  His ""Vesti la giubba"" is vocally sound, but that uber-italianate sniffling that is so much a part of his style has always been a source of annoyance for me.  I wish Domingo had returned for this role.

Dwayne Croft is one of my favorite young singers and is put to good use in the role of Silvio.  He's dashing and sophisticated, representing the promise of a step up in life for Nedda.  As Beppo, Kenn Chester has a sweet lyric sound.

Again, Levine and the Met orchestra are the perfect musical accompaniment to these acclaimed singers.  Had I been there at that gala opening night, I may have left after the close of Il Tabarro, knowing that after its riveting final 20 minutes, nothing that followed could possibly match it.",1136246400,5,4912,4.919902912621359
2295893,4,B0009K1ZHS,"Puccini's Tabarro is an sadly underappreciated and seldom performed opera; and while I was excited to see the MET's production with Domingo, I was dissapointed with many of the other singers. Stratas is too old, to shaky, and too past her prime to be attempting to sing a part that is both challenging and that is written for a younger voice. Whether it was throwing around her body to reach the high notes or scraping the bottom out of her throat, Stratas offers a terrible performance (unusual for such a wonderful performer). Yet looking past Stratas and several of her co-stars one can find an amazing performance. Domingo and Pons are superb. Domingo delivers an incredible ""Hai ben ragione"" which truly shows off his maturity and acting. Pons offers the yearning and cold Michele through his beautiful execution in ""Come e difficile"" and ""Nulla Silenzio."" For a Puccini lover who has not experienced Tabarro I would suggest getting the La Scala production of the entire Il Trittico. The cast is wonderful, youthful, and Piero Cappuccilli delivers the best performance of Michele yet on DVD.

Yet the pairing of Tabarro (with Domingo) with Pagliacci (with Pavarotti) makes this DVD worth buying. Once again, you will have  to listen to an elderly Stratas (although she performs better in Pagliacci) but it is well worth the pain in order to hear Pons and Pavarotti. ""Vesti la Giubba"" is flawless as is ""Non, Pagliaccio, non son"".

If you are a committed opera fan then I would suggest these productions, but for new opera fans I would stick with La Scala's Trittico on DVD.",1136160000,7,1578,4.858736059479554

My impression is that this is a very nice performance of the opera.  It is well conducted by a youthful James Levine, the Zeffirelli sets and costumes are excellent, the video direction by Brian Large was, as usual, thoughtful and dramatically compelling.  The last scene with Canio knifing Nedda made us gasp -- it was that dramatically intense.  The color quality -- saturation, images clarity -- was fine.  We listened to the PCM stereo track which was fine.",1503792000,,586,4.82
8062143,5,B0009K1ZHS,"This 1994 Opening Night Gala Performance is one of those events that could be reasonably described as legendary. Many factors lead to this expectation. These include a stellar cast list supported by the fine orchestra under James Levines expert direction. They also include an absolutely traditional pair of productions plus matching sets by Fabrizio Melano and Franco Zeffirelli. These are spectacular in the best sense of the word by keeping completely within the allotted time scale and the sense of believable reality.

The recording is presented visually in 4:3 as one would expect and the sound is presented in DTS 5.1; Dolby Digital 5.1 and stereo. This review made use of the DTS 5.1 option and that was not a matter for concern. Indeed, the orchestral contribution was startlingly clear in its underlining of dramatic detail and that is a tribute to both Levine and the recording engineers. The imaging, while not being of HD clarity, is still not a matter of concern. The camera work was well up to the standards expected of Video Director, Brian Large.

Moving on to the cast members, one must salute the quality of the dual roles played by Juan Pons as Michele in Il Tabarro and Tonio in Pagliacci. These are key roles and Juan Pons proves to be an excellent anchor man bringing considerable gravitas to the two roles with impressive stage presence and vocal delivery.

Teresa Stratas fulfils a similar function across the two operas and shows herself to be a compelling actress as Giorgetta in Il Tabarro and as Nedda in Pagliacci. Although, at this stage she might be considered past the ideal age for such roles featuring younger women, the reality is that she brings such vibrant intensity and physical energy to the roles that, even with close-up camera work, it hardly seems to matter.  In addition there is not the slightest sign of fatigue, weakness or beat in her voice on a demanding double role evening. Many younger singers could learn much from her vocal and dramatic deliveries as well as from her stamina in both considerations.

Domingo as Luigi here reprises a role with which he is utterly familiar and he does not disappoint. All three of these singers get considerable applause from the very appreciative audience, but the loudest and most prolonged acknowledgement is that reserved for Pavarotti making his dbut stage performance as Canio and demonstrating that he can not only sing fabulously but that he can also be a significant and credible actor in the stage role. This is a notable statement and the audience correctly single him out for especial praise.

The remaining members of the two casts give consistent and outstanding support and the concept of verismo is unfailingly delivered with considerable force to the audience. There are too many to individually comment upon but suffice it to say that neither cast has a single weak link either vocally or dramatically. Realism is the order of the day and is intensely portrayed throughout both works as intended by the composers.

Although both operas benefit immensely by the attention to detail and realism achieved by the stage productions of both Fabrizio Melano and Franco Zeffirelli, it is Zeffirellis concept that will most likely remain in the memory.  Incidental moments such as the acrobats and fire-eater and the entrance of Pagliaccis caravan pulled by a real horse do much to set the scene. The positioning of the watching crowd juxtaposed with the key players as Pagliacci remorselessly drives on to its inevitable conclusion is dramatically masterful. These two operas will especially delight those favouring a traditional presentation.

This then is a dual presentation of arguably monumental legendary status which, for many collectors, will continue to be definitive.",1478217600,,3776,5.048154093097914

8062145,1,B0009K1ZHS,"Everything about these two productions is excellent except for one thing.  Teresa Stratas is vocally way, way past her prime here.  In the Il Tabarro especially, the sound she makes resembles that of two cats fighting.  Her very highest notes are not bad, but everything else is gone--completely gone.  It totally ruins the recording, which is too bad because Pavarotti, as usual, is wonderful.",1466812800,,394,5.109375
8062146,1,B0009K1ZHS,"When my daughter told me she was deeply moved by the present production of Pagliacci at the Met (Jan-Feb 2016), I decided to buy for her a DVD movie version to which I could attach  for posterity  an account of my own personal love of this masterpiece I have had ever since I first heard the recording 54 years ago with Tito Gobbi, Giuseppe Di Stefano, and the incomparable Maria Callas, recorded at La Scala in 1954. Having caught just a brief glimpse of this Met version on a large screen inside the store at the Met, and after feeling the orchestration was right on the money and Pavarotti was magnificent, I assumed the entire production would also be impressive and selected this as my gift. I was dead wrong, but for a personal reason that may not matter to others. I have an understanding that allows staged operas to stretch my credibility when I see a young tenor singing that he loves a beautiful woman who is between 250-300 pounds and goes on and on about her physical beauty. But in a movie version, I expect the casting director and director to provide a visual experience that matches the storyline and libretto. See the version available through YouTube with Gina Lollobrigida as Nedda, even though she is lip syncing to Onelia Fineschi's wonderful voice. Take one look at the 21-yr old Gina and you can believe a husband would completely lose his mind if he caught her with another man. In the story, as per Canio tells us himself near the end, ""I am that fool who found you a starving orphan of the streets, and took you in, and offered you a name, and the fever and the folly of his love.""
So, the entire story of Pagliacci revolves around an older man who took a beautiful young woman off the streets and married her, foolishly expected he would be able to gain her love, and didn't realize that any man who looked at her would lust for her, and that a tragedy was simply waiting to happen. With all due respect to how wonderful Teresa Stratas' voice is, she has such deep rings under her eyes, can't even stand up straight, has a head full of grey hair, and performs such ridiculous antics as she's singing that I wonder what Zeffirelli must have been thinking  to allow such nonsensical behavior on the stage. She simply spoils the entire rationale for the tragedy. I cannot bear to watch any further than Stratas' first major solo, and I certainly will not give this DVD to my daughter. In fact, I'm going to remove one of the stars in my review before I submit this.",1455494400,2,2490,4.468131868131868
