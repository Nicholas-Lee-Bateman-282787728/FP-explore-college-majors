816098,3,6304239149,"Review of Giant
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

Giant lived up to its title, in every sense of the word. It starred the famously tall Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor, a petite woman with a larger-than-life personality off screen. George Stevens, one of the great Hollywood legends, directed the movie, and James Dean tragically died before the film was released, elevating it to an entirely different echelon. And at three and a half hours, it certainly had a gigantic running time as well.

While there are more all-American themes, such as settlers and Native Americans, or the Revolutionary War, Giant comes close to one of the most American films that came out of the twentieth century. Rock Hudson comes from money; oil runs through his veins. He picks the strong-tempered Liz Taylor for a wife, and she doesnt always fit in with his lifestyle. Instead, she seeks solace in her friendship with James Dean, a common hired hand, who represents the absolute opposite of her husband. One scrapes and claws for a chance to become a giant. The other already is, but he risks losing everything by resting on his laurels.

A powerful metaphor for the American Dream, Giant garnered ten Oscar nominations, and won Best Director. James Dean gives a startling performance, given his youth, but its heartbreaking to watch him in the film. Onscreen in the epic, he reaches an older age than he did in real life. To me, its one of those classics that you watch once or twice but don't really want to own in your collection, but give it a try and see if you like it!",1500422400,,1556,4.671532846715328
816099,1,6304239149,"Other interested shoppers out there (as well as Amazon) should know that I ordered this special edition and had to return it for defective manufacturing (the CD would get stuck in a particular scene and not budge anymore). I had the set replaced and the same thing happened with the second set only it got stuck in a different scene of the movie while it also had several stops and goes along the way. Both sets did not have consistent coloring either. I decided to return the second faulty set for a refund. Amazon should look into the manufacturer's quality of workmanship. For whatever is worth, my husband who's an engineer, said the products were defective because there is something wrong with the equipment the manufacturer is using to copy the movie. We all like to pay the lowest prices for the things we want but there is a point at which quality must prevail. Thank you!",1499385600,,881,4.617834394904459

816333,3,6304239149,"Watch ""Giant"" for its stars and because it's a classic.  The story itself is really bland, especially compared to the Edna Ferber novel, and the characters aren't all that interesting.  The roles need deeper characterization, the production values aren't that great even when compared to the ""computer-generated video-game sets"" of today, the racism could have been depicted better and more emotionally even for the 1950s, and Elizabeth Taylor's aging via makeup and wardrobe weren't too convincing.

Elizabeth Taylor's beauty, James Dean's smoldering, sulky performance as Jett and Rock Hudson make this movie. As a Texan, ""Yellow Rose of Texas"" and ""The Eyes of Texas"" playing constantly in the background are squirm-inducing and annoying.  The studios could have done a better job on the production values as well.  This country had become more conscious and sympathetic to racism by 1956, and the studio had a golden opportunity to make a real statement about it.  The Latino and African-American characters could have been given more presence and more of a voice that would have added to the plot, instead of making them stand there and be insulted while the white characters try to defend them.  The studio probably cared more about not offending white moviegoers and making $$$.  Still, ""Giant"" is a classic, so check it out at least once to say you did.",1485907200,,1361,5.099099099099099

816839,4,6304239149,"I remember first seeing this at the drive-in with my parents when I was 10. The title threw me a little--there are no ""giants"" in it. It struck me as just another ""cowboy movie"" and horse operas bored me--still do, in fact. My babysitters were head over heels and sighing over James Dean but I kept getting him mixed up with country singer Jimmy Dean who had a variety show on TV at the time. And it was looooooongg. Which to a 10-year-old attention span meant it draaaaaagged. Why did Jett (Dean's character) hate Bick so much? Bick (Rock Hudson's character) was never a mean boss to him. Why was Jett always showing off to Leslie (Liz Taylor's character)? And some of the weirdest scenes stuck in my mind. Like the funeral of Bick's sister Luz, when Bick's uncle played the organ. I didn't know it at the time, but the piece he played was Debussy's ""Clair de Lune""--not really funeral music. And piano music to boot. Like the Thanksgiving scene, when all the little kids were playing with the live turkey and calling him ""Pedro"". Then at the dinner table when they bring out the cooked turkey and one of the kids asks; ""Is that Pedro?"" When that is confirmed, all the kids start whining. But the one that stuck in my mind back then was when Bick got into a fight with the cook at a diner and they bump into the jukebox, which starts playing ""Yellow Rose Of Texas"" through the whole slugfest. I thought that one was cool without really knowing what it was about. I learned a few years later reading the Edna Ferber novel that it was because the diner guy was rude to Bick & Leslie's daughter-in-law and grandson. Something about the daughter-in-law being Mexican. So what was the big deal about Mexicans? I saw them on TV all the time and they were funny. Speedy Gonzalez was FUNNY. Quick Draw McGraw's deputy Baba Looey was FUNNY. Well, I guess that's what you get when you're faced with serious social stuff--and serious MOVIES--at only 10 years old.",1473033600,,1953,4.519774011299435

817628,2,6304239149,"This is a truly bad film. It has been called ""sprawling"" and this is accurate, but hardly a compliment. One might also have chosen ""undisciplined"", ""sloppy"", ""random"", ""lazy"". There are no conversations, only speeches. The characters are paper-doll stereotypes, sloppily drawn.
Why do some of them fall in love? We don't know, we just watch it happen for no reason at all. Similarly the hatred and bigotry we are meant to condemn has no context. The writing is so thin we can't be bothered to care about any of these actors, the people they clumsily portray or anything they pretend to care about either.
Which is tragic because race divides us as deeply today as it did in 1956 but this simplistic, self-righteous pap is more likely to annoy and bore the troglodytes among us, then and now, than bring them closer to a fuller humanity.
While lauded for it's direct, if insipid assault on redneck culture, the film's other notable feature is James Dean's performance. Sadly his remarkable craft serves mostly to draw glaring comparisons to the stiff, inauthentic delivery of the rest of the cast.
And while we're observing craft, the editing of Giant often appears to be disconnected from the narrative. One assumes this stumbling hatchet-work is imposed by an over-long and disjointed script fueled by hubris and untouched by discipline.
If you're a film student, Giant might serve you as a great example of what to avoid. Want to see what bad writing looks like? Empty character development? Painful editing? Look no further.",1451692800,,1527,4.945525291828794

With a cast that includes Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, James Dean, and Sal Mineo, it simply must be watched. It dealt with some important issues, too - feminism in West Texas, discrimination against Hispanics, old vs. new money. Since I'm from Texas and have been to the Alpine-Marfa area, I liked seeing the location. But overall, the plot is weak, the ensemble acting somehow doesn't quite come off, and the make up as the actors ""age"" gets worse and worse. And it is OVER THREE HOURS LONG!

819824,5,6304239149,"GIANT, this film is a masterpiece. I have always been an admirer of James Dean. This film let's us see him come full circle from a youthful rascally critter to an old man stubborn to the end clutching to some unrealized and unshared dream of acceptance by his fellow man. As Jett Rink, Dean knew exactly his own feelings in regard to the social economic classes that society had conveniently categorized individuals, especially those germane to Texas. He feels no guilt toward his own prejudices and only strives to be accepted by the upper class (his fellow man) from which he literally rose up to from the ground and enters into its ranks. Rock Hudson's Bick Benedict, from his perspective, was born into the upper class and sees himself as a great benefactor to the lower classes that are employed by him. Unlike Dean's character, he is unaware of his own prejudices.

The Elizabeth Taylor character, Leslie Benedict, stands away from the canvas and represents the unprejudiced point of view of the unflawed human spirit. She stands as a mirror to reflect back the personifications that both Dean and Hudson exhibit. She is direct and to the point with Hudson, her husband in the film. He is just too blinded by his own upbringing to even make some sense of what she is trying to point out in his flawed but self-noble character. With Dean she is subtle in her assessment of his human qualities, just as subtle as he is in the revelation of his prejudices. Hudson does finally confront his flawed character very nobly and very unaware of his own motivations.

Dean does come full circle and ends up where he started - still a scoundrel, but old and used up. I think that the Hudson and Dean characters were a reflection of Texas society from both ends of the spectrum set in the mid-twentieth century. As noble as the Hudson character was in his attempt at redemption, Texas was not ready for change at that time in History, but the seeds were planted (also represented by Hudson and Taylor's offspring in the film) and it was just a matter of time. I was born and raised in New England, but visited Texas many times where half of my family resides. I have seen Texas first hand from the early 60's to the present. This film has a special meaning for me. The characters and the performances ring true. George Stevens' attention to detail is seen and heard in every frame of this film. The performances of its three stars are flawless, as are those of its many supporting players.

The Dimitri Tiomkin score is a great asset to the feel of this film. He thematically represents the characters and their backgrounds to dramatically drive the narrative. One scene that made you want to stand up and cheer was the fight in the roadside diner. This scene was just as moving and exciting as the bar room brawl in George Stevens' SHANE and it has his directorial fingerprint all over it. I highly recommend that people get a chance to see this film and place themselves in the not too distant past and view it from the perspective of when its characters lived and thrived.",1413936000,,3068,4.605118829981718

Cambrige walks away with the film, and Carol Baker is extremely effective. I so wanted to love this film all over again, but it's lost a lot of its magic. The aging makeup is terrible, and James Dean performance suddenly seeems ridiculously mannered. If it had looked a good as it should, it would have helped enormously, but this is a terrible transfer. Sorry to be a spoil sport, but compared to some of the great classics from the '40's, this isn't in the same league. I'm happy that so many people still love it however.

And I saw it a flock more times, theatrically, in its many reissues throughout the years, until it finally made it to laser disc in '85. In fact, I received my just-released copy, mailed  from Ken Crane's, on the very day that Rock Hudson died.  By that time, it had begun to look like an overlong soap opera with a pretty obvious anti-bigot theme. But it remains epic film-making, 1950s style, and one that wasn't a biblical extravaganza. like so many of them were. This was up for the Best Picture Oscar, but lost to AROUND THE WORLD, which, today, looks just like a travelogue peppered with a lot of has-been actors and a few big ticket ones.

She attempts to break the traditions of her male dominated world by voicing her opinion, helping the poor against her husband's wishes, refusing to be  her husband's possession, accepting her son's marriage and having a compassionate understanding for Jame's Deans character.

The only extras included on the blu-ray are: the introduction by George Stevens, Jr.; the audio commentary by Stevens, screenwriter Ivan Moffat and critic Stephen Farber; and the 46 minute documentary ""George Stevens: Filmmakers Who Knew Him"".

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The story of `Giant' is long, detailed, and full of exploration. `Giant' is a richly rewarding story that explores some serious thematic material. It begins by being a story of two people falling in love: Jordan ""Bick"" Benedict Jr. [Rock Hudson] and Leslie Lynnton [Elizabeth Taylor], even though the two seem to have little in common. Bick was traveling to buy a horse within Maryland and is a wealthy Texan who is head of a ranching family. He fancies Leslie when he meets her while on this trip, and she equally fancies him. Leslie breaks up an engagement she was in so that she can leave with Bick and go to Texas. The long journey of `Giant' only begins here.

Over the course of the storyline, the film explores racial discrimination from the Southern white ranchers and seeks to explore the development of the Benedict family towards racial equality as Leslie determinedly helps to change things for the family. This is a core theme of the story. The Mexican American workers who work for the Benedict's were isolated, segregated, and ignored. In one integral scene of the film, Leslie helps a seriously ill worker who was receiving no help medically. It becomes clear to her that not enough is being done to care for these people, who Leslie understands work with them. Yet she sees that they are being discriminated against. In concluding the film, there is a pivotal scene that makes a definitive statement about the great importance of racial equality. It becomes clear that one of the points of the film is to say that being a ""Giant"" can have more to do with standing up for what is right than for always being showered with riches.

In voicing her opinions and fighting for what she believes in, Leslie also changes the stance on a woman's role within this family business infrastructure. She wants to do the same kind of work the men do and she wants to be able to be involved in the process that the other men so selfishly attempt to keep to themselves. In a key sequence, Leslie Lynnton Benedict and Jordan ""Bick"" Benedict Jr. disagree over an issue while Bick's having a meeting with his male colleagues. He refuses to listen to her and let her join in the meeting. This causes marital problems between the two, who have a temporary separation during the film's story. This is another big focal point of the story, and it makes the film much more compelling and important as a result.

James Dean plays the role of Jett Rink, who was working for Luz Benedict [Mercedes McCambridge], and trying to make a living so that he could eventfully become rich and leave Texas behind. It was his dream: an American dream of finding success. Upon Luz Benedict's passing, he is given shares that allow him land of his own because he was in Luz Benedict's will. Jordan ""Bick"" Benedict Jr. tries  to purchase back the share of the land but Jett Rink rejects. He eventually finds oil and becomes a bigger tycoon with greater wealth and power than the Luz Benedict family. Yet his greatest tragedy lies in how his feelings for Leslie Lynnton Benedict (whom he is in love with) can never come to fruition and his pain leads directly into a path of his own destruction.

The part of Jett in `Giant' was James Dean's final performance on film and it was his peak between the three films. Despite being a supporting role, James Dean's performance as Jett arguably became the most stand-out one of the films despite a shorter appearance compared to the lead performers, Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Whenever I think of `Giant,' despite the many amazing elements to the film, the first thing I always think of is James Dean and his iconic role in it: wearing his similarly iconic Cowboy hat which helped to add flavour to his performance.

The canvas of the filmmaking in `Giant' was quite expansive and it is something that George Stevens understood how to utilise especially well as a filmmaker. George Stevens was not an overt director like so many are instead of wanting to draw attention to stylistic flourishes, he wanted to hone in on the performances of the actors. Yet a masterful skill resided in George Stevens to deliver incredible shots, these fantastic moments of cinematic greatness when he felt it necessary. He was more capable than most filmmakers as a true visionary of the medium and how to best utilise it to share stories.

George Stevens was so precise when it came down to his directing efforts. `Giant' is one of the great epics in cinema history. He was entirely capable of telling the detailed story inherent in the book and script while also bringing the best out of his actors. I feel as though he seemed to know exactly when things could shine further with moments of extreme majesty shining through. It was the quiet moments that he created that helped to form the greater, big picture.

`Giant' is without a doubt one of my favourite film in this entire collection: it is one of the greatest of all westerns and a truly remarkable cinematic achievement. Featuring excellent performances by Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean and based upon the novel by Edna Ferber, Giant is one of the greatest films ever made.

Blu-ray Video Quality - `Giant' is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1, which is the ratio that was utilised during filming. The film itself was exhibited in cinemas with the more common 1.85:1 ratio, but this Blu-ray presents the film with the most authentic representation of the work done during the making of the movie. This 1080p image transfer does a good job with the presentation of MPI's restoration efforts, which resulted from a 4K scan of the negative.

With regards to `Giant,' this transfer could surely have been improved had the film been allowed breathing room across a two-disc presentation, and one would hope such an effort would have been allowed to yield even greater results than what is found with this Blu-ray edition. At the very least, I feel the film could have been included across three discs: one showing the film uninterrupted, and another two discs preserving the film with the best possible transfer. As unlikely as this scenario sounds for Warner Bros., I feel as though some films merit this as presentation quality-control and that some films could be improved with a simple solution similar to what I am suggesting.

I've never before seen the film look as good as it does here. The film itself is filled with so many conversational-pieces and slow pan camera sequences that the bit-rates are relatively strong for the material presented and help to maintain what is mostly notable about the film quality in regards to depth, colour, and detail. There is also little damage: restoration efforts by MPI helped with this aspect of the presentation. Lastly, I also noticed no unnecessary digital tinkering, which helps to solidify this as an impressive transfer worthy of consideration.

Blu-ray Audio Quality - By a large margin, I consider the presentation Warner Bros. has allotted to `Giant' in the sound department to be the absolute best of the three recently released James Dean films arriving on Blu-ray for the first time. This is primarily because the film's audio presentation has been preserved with stereo sound rendered in 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio, sourced from the mono soundtrack and preserving the general soundstage with an authentic sounding representation of the source.

Maintaining the original audio design allows for the film's audio to sound natural and authentic and closer to the way as it did when released to theatres for the first time. There is surprising fidelity for a film of this age. It doesn't sound digitally altered and the sound-stage is impressive with good clarity and depth for the stereo sound. Dialogue is clearly distinguishable and easy to understand. The score and sound effects have decent range and sound reasonably good. I certainly found the film benefited from its notable sound-design.

Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras:

Feature Film Blu-ray: Introduction by George Stevens, Jr. [2:55] Recorded in 1995, Stevens, Jr. provides an optional introduction summarizing various points that will be covered in greater depth in the remaining extras.

Commentary by George Stevens, Jr., Screenwriter Ivan Moffat and Film Critic Stephen Farber: As with Shane, Stevens served as an uncredited production assistant on Giant. He and Moffat provide a wealth of insights, memories and trivia, although much of it is duplicated in the other extras. Farber acts as informal moderator, prompting Stevens and Moffat with questions. Even with three participants, however, it proves difficult to keep up a continuous commentary for over three hours. An alert listener will notice that some portions of the commentary in the last half hour are literally replays of earlier sections (e.g., Stevens' comments on Michael Todd and the Oscar results).

George Stevens: Filmmakers Who Knew Him [45:40] First released in 2001 on the DVD of A Place in the Sun, this documentary features revealing interviews with an impressive array of notables, including Warren Beatty, Frank Capra, Rouben Mamoulian, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Alan J. Pakula, Robert Wise and Fred Zinneman.

Bonus Special Documentary 3rd DVD:

George Stevens: A Filmmaker's Journey [1:51:24] This 1984 documentary, written, produced and directed by George Stevens, Jr., provides a detailed overview of the life and career of George Stevens the director. Beginning with his early days in Hollywood as a cameraman for Hal Roach, when George Stevens saved Stan Laurel's career by figuring out how to photograph the future comedy legend so that his pale blue eyes would register on film, the documentary traces George Stevens' long career directing such skilful light fare as `Alice Adams' (with Katherine Hepburn), `Swing Time' (with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) and `Woman of the Year' (with Audrey Hepburn and Spencer Tracy).

World War II changed Stevens' outlook: Volunteering for military service (along with such notables as William Wyler, Frank Capra and John Ford), Stevens was assigned by General Eisenhower to document the Normandy invasion. Later, he directed a film crew that recorded the liberation of the concentration camp at Dachau. He returned from four years of war having lost all interest in comedy or anything else on the lighter side. Indeed, for several years, Stevens seemed uninterested in directing at all.

With `I Remember Mama' in 1948, George Stevens began the series of films that would bring him two Oscars for Best Director, great popular success and major industry clout. The list includes `Giant,' `A Place in the Sun' and `Shane.' The winning streak ended in 1965, with the troubled production of `The Greatest Story Ever Told,' starring Max von Sydow as Jesus.

It was during this period that George Stevens became embroiled in an infamous controversy within the Directors Guild of America, when Cecil B. DeMille, a staunch anti-Communist and supporter of the blacklist, attempted to remove Joseph L. Mankiewicz as president and to institute loyalty pledges. Stevens led the successful opposition, although, as recounted by Fred Zinneman and John Huston, it was the venerable John Ford who stood up at a key moment and delivered the coup de grace.

The documentary uses substantial archival footage, including recordings of Stevens himself, and its interviewees are an impressive roster, many of whom are no longer with us. In addition to Hepburn, Zinneman and Huston, participants include: Joel McCrea, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Fred Astaire, Ginger Roger, Millie Perkins, Frank Capra and Alan Pakula (whose stories about Shane are brief but memorable).

Finally, when you hear people say ""they don't make them like they used to"" `Giant' is probably one of the first films that springs to mind. This masterpiece of cinematic craft and storytelling is both socially important and marvellous to behold. The visual qualities are so sublime and yet it's not the showiest of films: this is a film that is so nuanced and wonderfully realized that it stands significantly apart from most other productions of its time and even of modern cinema. This is one of the best epics to ever be made and George Stevens made that possible through the brilliance of the directing. The story and the great performances make this an essential viewing. Whether you care most about the acting from Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, or James Dean or perhaps the magnificent storytelling and there is no mistaking the brilliance of this significant classic. Giant should belong in everyone's Blu-ray Collection who is a massive fan of great classic cinema. So much so, this Special Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook is totally amazing and so beautifully professionally presented and so with a massive tour-de-force film and this ultimate Special Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook, it is again a great honour to add this to my Blu-ray Collection and in a few years' time will become a very rare item, so don't delay, as in time this will no longer be available. Highly Recommended!

820905,5,6304239149,"Edna Ferber's writings were outstanding; so I'm not surprised the screen-writers had a field day with her book, turning it into a motion picture of epic proportions. Basically, that's what ""GIANT"" is...an epic. The acting is exceptional, the musical score is strong, and periods of the scenic background are quite favorable. While the near-ending Jett Rink (James Dean) scenes may be a bit over the top, the beginning and ending are, in my opinion, the best parts of the film. The chemistry between Rock Hudson's and Elizabeth Taylor's characters is surprisingly good and the fight in ""Sarges"" diner is a lulu! Those are my favorite parts. It's a good mix of drama, humor, and emotion on a grandiose Texas scale.",1394323200,,712,4.941666666666666

821134,3,6304239149,"The consensus of opinion seems to be that this transfer was as good a job possible considering the condition of original elements but it's still extremely disappointing due to the film's well deserved status as one of the best films of the 1950's. The problem was that this was made right after the major studios had abandoned the cumbersome and expensive (but quality wise stunning!) three strip Technicolor process. Kodak's new negative film stock was imperfect and Warner Brothers own WarnerColor lab process was problematic at best. Many a good film and a few great ones (""Giant"" in particular!) were sabotaged by WarnerColor.

I have the previous standard DVD version which isn't even anamorphic but to my eyes still looks basically more satisfactory when zoomed in on my Panasonic 60"" Plasma than this HDTV Blu-ray (which of course doesn't even need the zooming). Do a Google search for ""DVD Beaver Giant Blu-ray)"" and look at the screen cap comparisons and I think you'll see what I mean. Color just seems more accurate and the image sharper on the old letterbox DVD.

Unless 4K really takes off I suspect this version of ""Giant"" is as good as we'll ever see in our lifetime and that's pretty sad. Still recommended if you love this film and don't have it but if you have the old regular DVD I'd think twice about upgrading to this Blu-ray. I wouldn't do it again.

Oh yeah...it's admittedly a very nice deluxe edition with a 46 page mini-book, two extra standard DVD's, one of special features from the old DVD. another with the excellent full length feature ""George Stevens: A Filmmaker's Journey"". The deluxe packaging and the Stevens documentary somewhat soften the blow of the disappointing transfer.",1388880000,,1712,4.896551724137931

821240,5,6304239149,"One of my favorite classic movies, and presumably most here have seen it before so I won't harp on the content. At 3 hours, 20 minutes, it's immersive, from the era when people had the patience for longer films with lots of dialogue. There are a few cringe-worthy scenes (one involving children crying in unison), but those are outweighed by the masterful ones. Some of James Dean's scenes here are more compelling than many in 'Rebel', and leave you wishing he had had more screen time. His nonverbal acting is amusing and engaging. Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor were the established stars, however, and they carry off their aging roles brilliantly. Fifty seven years later it's still a beautiful film to watch.

I purchased the 3 disc Blu Ray version. First, the packaging is terrific -- it looks great, the booklet is nicely bound in so it won't become lost, and the extra feature discs (DVD) are relevant and interesting -- mostly interviews with less prominent cast members and the director's son. It feels like a durable package, and one that you could display on a shelf, not a cheesy blue plastic case. Regarding the picture and sound quality, it may be because there's only so much you can do with film shot in 1955, but I have a hard time imagining that a DVD couldn't deliver nearly the same picture and sound quality. Given the very slight price difference, it's probably just as well to buy the Blu Ray, but if I had already owned it on DVD I'm not sure I'd be in a hurry to pay another $20 for this version.",1386547200,,1524,4.562043795620438

And it apparently has not been remastered. Do not buy this film if you are expecting a beautiful clear picture like one would expect with a blu-ray disc. It seems if the blu-ray has only magnified the flaws of this transfer.,1383955200,,538,4.5
821328,3,6304239149,"The film ""GIANT""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giant-Blu-ray/dp/B00E5QTW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giant (Blu-ray)</a>&nbsp;is a terrific movie, but, I never review film content because there are already too many opinions when it comes to movie reviews. My reviews are strictly based on the video and sound quality of the disk, whether a plain DVD or Blu-ray.

For some strange reason (although maybe it's not so strange if a Blu-ray review can fool someone that is buying a plain DVD think the picture quality is beautiful because of all the reviews being lumped together and unless the reviewer states what version they are reviewing, you're lost), Amazon continues to lump together all reviews, from VHS through Blu-ray.  While a review of the movie itself might be valid across formats, QUALITY is a whole other story.

I only watched a friends Blu-ray of ""GIANT"" and haven't decided yet whether or not I will buy this Blu-ray.  The reason is because I have a regular DVD collection of nearly 500 films.  Originally, because I was a film collector, it was supposed to replace the films in my film collection, plus any other films that I never had on film but always wanted.  Somehow it grew.  Because I used projectors (for film and video) viewing, when Blu-rays came out, I decided to replace my ""favorite films with Blu-rays.  Once again it got out of hand and I now have about 200 Blu-rays (and growing).

However, as my Blu-ray collection grew, I began to notice that many of these ""new"" Blu-ray's picture (and in some cases sound) quality was either the same, or only ""slightly better than the DVD's I was replacing.  Because of this, I am trying to be more selective on what I replace now.  I know that part of the problem is that the majority of my films are from the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's and the elements from many of these films were in bad shape (not because of age, but because of poor handling.  Having been a projectionist, I ran many of these films when they came out (or were re-released), so I'm familiar with what they looked like on the screen in most cases.

When I bought the first DVD of ""GIANT"" in 2006, it was claimed to have been ""restored"".  I even read a review of the purported restoration by George Steven's son, who said he was even a second unit director.  He said that the sound and picture never looked so good and if I recall, said he thought it looked ""better"" than the original.  I did run ""GIANT"", and recall what I thought was bad timing.  However, after see that DVD, I now think (IMHO) it was just some bad photography. In addition, the bad poor soundtrack on the film, is STILL bad on the DVD and now the Blu-ray.  Just like you can't make bad photography good. you can't make distorted sound on most of the music mix, sound perfect.

A number of years ago PBS ran ""GIANT"" and although they butchered the film (cutting out the fight in the diner, if you can believe that), the print's color timing, contrast and focus was beautiful.  Although it wasn't possible for me to determine if the sound was better than on the DVD.

Now comes this Blu-ray of ""GIANT"" and while I wasn't able to view it on my projector, which would show any defects and was why I was converting my DVD's to Blu-ray in the first place. After my first viewing, it doesn't appear much better than the DVD, if at all.  When the cost is factored in (high cost for mediocre quality Blu-ray), unless you don't already have the 2006 DVD or have never seen ""GIANT"" (which is a great saga of early 20th century Texas), then this Blu-ray of ""GIANT"" is a MUST HAVE.",1383955200,,3623,4.663522012578617

821535,5,6304239149,"What I think I responded to most about `Giant' was the fact that it was far from what I had initially anticipated.  Don't you love it when that happens?  You settle in to watch a film that you are expecting to like, but are blown away when the plot unfolds in a way that takes you by surprise and winds up delivering a more powerful and memorable experience.

So, for those of you who have not seen this are may have been under the impression, like I was, that this was some sultry love triangle film; it's not.  Despite the obvious attraction that Jett expresses towards Leslie, Leslie never has an affair, and while her relationship with her husband, Bick, is rocky and tumultuous, their rich love for one another is the backbone and the highlight of this rather masterful film.

`Giant' tells the story of a stubborn and arrogant (but not obnoxiously so) cattle baron who meets and falls, almost instantly, for the young an opinionated Leslie.  He weds her, beds her and takes her with him back to Texas, where her charm and nave manners are met with opposition by the racism and coldness of the south (and you thought Southerners were hospitable).  As the film unfolds, we witness Leslie and Bick come to terms with the roles of their relationship, through tragedy, children and the rise of a Texan empire in Jett Rink.  Yes, Jett, once the solemn ranch hand who grated Bick's nerves has struck it rich with oil and is slowly but surely taking over Texas, much to the dismay of Bick who was at one time rested comfortably at the top.

The epic scale of this film is not lost in the details, but instead thrives in every one of them.  I completely understand why director George Stevens won the Directing Oscar (although I'm still baffled that this lost Best Picture, especially to THAT film), and the fact that most of the cast walked away with nominations was also nice to see, especially since this is probably the best I've ever seen Rock Hudson, an actor I often find quite one note and stiff and yet he melted into his role as the frustrated Bick extremely well.  James Dean delivers a knock-out SUPPORTING performances here, completely sinking into his character and delivering a chilling performance (and that final soliloquy is breathtaking).  I strongly feel that is he had been campaigned properly (in the right category), he would have won the posthumous Oscar.

I'm baffled that Elizabeth Taylor was not nominated, especially since she is the MVP of the film and delivers a brilliant performance that is so layered and so intricate and basically anchors the film from start to finish.

At the end of the day, I'm in love here.  At nearly three and a half hours, this is the definition of epic and it feels that way.  It is melodramatic, sure, but it handles itself with incredible grace and depth of emotion and beautiful imagery.

They don't call it `Giant' for nothing, for this really is larger than life.",1379980800,,2924,4.635658914728682

He died at the age of 24 in a car crash, and, like most icons taken from us too early (See: Heath Ledger), passed into pop culture immortality. Effortlessly cool, the essence of counterculture, beautiful, attractive to both sexes, and a phenomenal actor, James Dean had a long and lustrous career ahead of him, but tragically left us only three films. But they are three brilliant films.

Though Giant is less than the sum of it's parts, though it would lose half it's power if the brilliant Dean did not act in it, it is a classic among film because of the figure that strides it like a colossus: James Byron Dean. His stage presence, his emotion, his tough exterior but complex mind mark him as one of cinema's truly great actors.

821543,4,6304239149,"In GIANT, the last entry of James Dean's motion picture trilogy, he portrays Jeff Rink, an oil rig worker who acquires a piece of land, sets out on his own, strikes oil and eventually becomes a petroleum multi-millionaire. On the night of the triumphant opening of his magnificent airport/hotel complex some years later, Rink boozes himself into oblivion and shocks the attending crowd with an incoherent podium speech. (Note: Dean's inebriated ramblings were dubbed by Nick Adams.)

Here, Dean enthusiastically chews scenery and everything in sight; thus he's the best-remembered part of a story that's primarily about the Benedicts, 'Bick' (Rock Hudson) and Leslie (Elizabeth Taylor), and the contrasts between their old money elegance and the nouveau riche vulgarity of Dean's.

A sweeping Edna Ferber melodrama as big as the Lone Star State itself that's directed by George Stevens, ""Giant"" unfolds more slowly than most newer films. Despite great scenery, cinematography, sets, a strong cast and fine music score, because of its leisurely pace this epic hasn't held up as well (in my opinion) as Dean's penultimate effort,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REBEL-WITHOUT-A-CAUSE/dp/B0007US7EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE</a>&nbsp;(1955).

Sorry to say, I was greatly disappointed. I forced myself to watch to the end, and was glad I got my copy from the local library (for free, thank Heaven) instead of buying it. The standard for accomplished acting (think: Kenneth Branagh) and directing (think: Spielberg) has risen so high that it's truly painful to watch Rock Hudson attempt to squeeze emotion from his role. Liz Taylor was fair, and the supporting cast (Chill Wills, etc.,) was pretty good, but the direction dragged, dragged, dragged. I restrained myself from saying out loud, ""Move it along, move it along!"" (Was George Stevens compensated per minute that the film ran?) Acting kudos, if any, go to James Dean; his character was lazily, sleazily annoying, but a convincing portrayal of a neer-do-well propelled to ""greatness"" by sudden wealth. The rest of the leading actors evidence, I suppose, the era of the Big Studio, hiring some actors for ""star appeal"" and good looks despite questionable talent.

822252,3,6304239149,"The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a tv special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young tv show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink.

  Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable.

822496,2,6304239149,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic.

Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife.

The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it.

At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs.

Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back.

Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech.

The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals.

The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property.

Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying.

Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him.

Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained.

The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute).

The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex.

'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict saga--he pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout.

Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.",1351555200,,5796,4.8404040404040405

822500,5,6304239149,"Giant! That one word that says it all! Giant is without a doubt a true classic in more ways than one. Filming in Marfa, Texas and enlisting a tremendous list of some of the most famous movie stars ever to embrace the silver screen; Rock Hudson, ""Liz"" Taylor, James Dean, Mercedes MacCambridge, Chill Wills, Paul Fix, Rod Taylor and of course the biggest of all; Texas!!! Every reviewer before me has more than described Giant and I do not think I could add much more to describe my opinion. That being said, Giant is one of my top 10 movies in my Western DVD collection and is number 3 in my view.  For those who have never seen Giant, take time and look at what the West really was; of course it was indicative of the early 20th century, but yet in southwest Texas, what you see in the drama IS Texas.  Being an Arizonan and growing up on a 6000 acre cattle ""spread"", it represents very well what it was. Then oil changed the whole image of Texas; yet, even today, there are still remnents of cattle ranches that dot the landscape of southwest Texas, and the people on these spreads still show the old style of what their ancestors bought to it; a strong spirit, hard working and a down to earth philosophy of determination and respect for everyone.  An outstanding movie!!!",1336262400,,1275,4.44017094017094
822501,5,6304239149,"This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power.

The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty.

The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them.

Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes.

She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite.

She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him.

The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children.

There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro.

The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas

The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches.

The moral is given by some member of that rich band: ""You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich."" Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility.

Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law.

That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word ""future"" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary.

822638,2,6304239149,"Those reviewers who thought this was a great film, have a Medical Marijuana Card, or are from Texas and voted for both Bushes.

On every level, this film is a disaster -- acting, directing, story, cinematography.  But you must see it just to appreciate how bad it is.

First:  Elizabeth Taylor can recite dialog with the best of them.  But . . . OMG, who thought super short Elizabeth Taylor would look good next to super tall Rock Hudson? (Next to Alan Ladd, yes.)  And the director shoots their scenes full body so you dramatically see that she is about 5'2"" and Hudson is 6'4"".  She even wears 3"" or 4"" heels and it doesn't help.  The only time he holds her is during close-ups -- she is standing on a box so her head hits his chest.  In reality, her head would be just a little higher than his belt buckle.  Also, Taylor just had a baby in real life, and was chubby through this film.  The director could have shot her at angles to make her look thinner, but all the shots of her accentuate her weight.  (Skinny Audrey Hepburn was originally considered for the role, but she turned it down.  Maybe the director didn't get the memo and used the original camera angles for a skinny actress.)  Yeah, this DVD is worth the price just to see how Elisabeth Taylor looked in real life.  (Richard Burton once described her as a short, fat bitch, with big tits.  Then he married her.)

By far one of the worst scenes in the film is when Taylor and Hudson are standing at a window with their backs to us.  He has his arm around her.  His sister has died because Elizabeth's horse threw her.  The horse was Elizabeth's favorite, which Rock bought from her family for breeding.  She loves that horse -- only she can ride it.  Elizabeth, with Rock's arm around her, asks him about her horse.  Without pause or sympathy, Rock replies ""I shot him.""  Elizabeth does not flinch.  Then Rock says that he had to put the horse down because he had a broken leg.  George Stevens should have had Elizabeth immediately push Rock away and say ""You did what?!""  He can then hug her and tell her the horse was in pain, and it was he humane thing to do.  As the scene stands, her non-reaction is entirely inappropriate.

Second: Rock Hudson cannot recite dialog with the best of them.  Often, his face does not match the words he is speaking.  Even when he is silent and tries to ""emote"", his face loses the scene (e.g. the opening dinner table scene at Elizabeth's house.  He looks goofy.)  Hudson is best in a farce like ""Pillow Talk"", and not a drama.  He was truly miscast in this film.

Third: Poor James Dean.  His last movie and it had to be a real stinker.  His problem was that he trusted the director George Stevens.  ""Keep your hat down over your eyes, and stand in the dark shadows Jimmy, no one wants to see your face, or what you're thinking"" his director probably told him.  ""We only want the audience to see your face on rare occasions.""  And he has Dean go from under-acting a scene, to over-acting a scene (e.g. when he tells Rock he hit oil -- he's way over the edge).  Dean should have followed Marilyn Monroe's advice and refused to come out of his trailer until he was allowed to follow his own instincts and direct himself.

Fourth: As part of the plot, all three leads are racists (e.g. Elizabeth Taylor's father has black servants that are treated kindly, but they are servants and know their place, and Rock Hudson treats the Mexicans like his cattle. And James Dean -- although poor -- distances himself from ""those wet backs"".  For the benefit of his fans and prosperity, Dean should have demanded that his character be sympathetic to the plight of the poor Mexicans.  It would have made a better story.  Especially when he strikes it rich -- he could have helped the Mexicans.  There was much of this 201 minute film that was unnecessary and could have been reduced to 100 minutes at the most, and still carried the major plot.

George Stevens was the director and had absolute control of all aspects of this film.  He cast the wrong actors. Rock Hudson does not walk or talk like he owns the second largest cattle ranch in Texas -- he simply talks loud to express authority, nor is he convincing in his love for Taylor.  Taylor looks short and fat and out of place in all of her scenes.  James Dean is either manic or mumbles his way through his scenes.  Different actors were definitely needed.  (Think of Clark Gable, Ava Gardner, and Paul Newman.)  And Stevens should have had the balls to tear several pages out of the script.  Hell, Gone With The Wind (a truly great film) did not try to film every page of the book.

Stevens also supervised the photography.  With the exception of one shot -- James Dean in the expensive car with his feet up, which has become iconic -- there is not one scene in the entire 1956 film that ranks with Alan Ladd looking at Jack Palance (immediately before the shoot-out) in Steven's 1953 film, Shane.

And all of the shots of Taylor should have been from the waist up, and every scene with Hudson should have been behind a table, fence, divan, etc. so she could stand on a box.  She does, in some scenes, wear a bullet bra to make her chest look bigger and her waist smaller, but then photographing her bare arms only served to emphasize her chubbiness.

Also, in the death scene of the gay incestuous sister, note how James Dean walks into the parlor.  He does a super exaggerated John Wayne, bow legged stride.  It's like he's on a boat with his shoulders tipping way to the right, then way to the left.  It's comical in a non-funny way.  And with his hat covering his face he steps into the shadows of the hall way, tilts his head, and only one eye can be seen -- like something out of a horror movie. Good grief!  Stevens knows better.  And Dean knows better.  Dean should have said ""George, WTF!  You want me to walk stupid like that -- which I don't do in any other scene of the movie -- and you are not even going to light me?""  That walk is not part of Dean's character in the film -- why do it in this scene?

And obviously, neither Taylor or Hudson watched the dailies of this film -- or they would not have come out of their trailers either.

No, this is not a great film.  It is not even a mediocre film.  It is a terrible film.  Enjoy the disaster.

For you Texans: Okay, the broad open expanses of dry dusty Texas with the tumble weeds and illegals are photographed well.  George did that right.",1330128000,,6452,4.377740303541315

How wonderful to have the long list of acters no longer with us such as Sal Mineo, Jimmy Dean, Rock Hudson, and Elizabeth Taylor just to name a few that were either in their youth both in age and career.

This is a travesty coming from a great company like Warner Brothers Home Video. I was ashamed when I showed this movie to some friends. They even noticed how bad it looked. We tried zooming, stretching, squeezing, everything a widescreen tv can do and it would not make this dismal transfer any better. Now with blu ray on the market, Warner needs to step up in their picture quality for their DVD releases. I pray that Warner is working on a new restoration of the magnificent picture and sound that is expected for this classic. This great motion picture deserves better than what Warner has put out here. Just think, the blu ray should fit the whole movie on one side of a disc instead of a two sided disc like this one. And I would love to see this movie in 1080p! Talk about beauty!!

It looks best on the smaller screen because of the lack of detail and poor color rendition.  Don't buy this DVD if you still have the VHS.

822725,5,6304239149,"As the title of the film states, ""Giant,"" meaning out sized, over scaled, Jumbo, excessive. The Rialto ranch, where this film takes place, Texas, the meals, the livestock, the Rock--this film overflows with swagger. But in a deeper sense, the film captures everything small about the time in which racism, sexism, and stratification were bluntly reflected in speech and custom. Giant is a fitting title for a film featuring 3 of Hollywood's greatest icons. I don't know if any actor before or since Jimmy Dean has acted in three films(to my knowledge)as convincingly as he did (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause, and Giant).

Basically, Giant is about 2 people, one who's already a giant and one who is just one rung up from the Mexican house and field workers who maintain the ranch, Jett Rink, played by Dean. Jett is the ranch pee-on who wouldn't even be on the ranch if it were not for Hudson's tough ornery sister who, through her death, wills her share of the ranch to Jett. Inadvertantly, Jett strikes oil and the tables and class dynamics are reversed in his favor. Once the ant, he becomes the giant and makes life on the ranch a living hell for Hudson and Taylor.

This is a great movie, from a sociological perspective, one of the first films to tackle racism head-on and the root of it all, stratification. There's also a thread involving a very very young Dennis Hopper as Hudson's son who falls in love with a Mexican girl. Highly entertaining on every level.",1319068800,,1475,4.6692307692307695

Well, it was kind of like 2 movies in one.  Today, it would have been a mini-series.  I loved Elizabeth Taylor- at her most beautiful, just breathtaking to look at her.  I never thought of Rock Hudson as a serious actor, but this is one serious movie.  Then you throw in James Dean- who really looks the part of the alienated loner yet very cool hearthrob.  The story is tremendous and it didn't drag on or become boring even after 3 hours.  Think of it as Gone with the Wind Texas style.  Toward the end it became a little more like a soap opera than a movie and the story lines and dialogue definitely had a ""Father Knows Best"" 1950s type quality.  Very corny at times especially at the very end, but by then you've come to love the characters and you love the movie.  The preachy finale about racial tolerance was a little over the top, but i realized later that this was 1956 and it was a different world then- many Americans were not racially tolerant and instead of corny, it was actually courageous. I don't know if you would say its one of the greatest movies of all time as much as one of the greatest stories.

822976,5,6304239149,"Quite possibly the inspiration for the TV series ""Dallas"", this tale of Texas is indeed, larger than life; the rich story by Edna Ferber bought to the screen with a cast of characters second to none at the time.  James Dean who became a film legend before and after his time, played magnificently the role of Jett Rink, a ranch hand who was too smart to play dead, too underprivileged to compete - yet.  As Jordan Benedict (Rock Hudson)returns from the East Coast bringing not only a blooded foundation horse to improve his stock, but also a stunning young Eastern wife, Jett Rink is instantly overwhelmed by her beauty and class; she is a breed apart, untouchable.  But maybe, just maybe, not!  - if he somehow could become rich and refined enough!  Thus begins his life-long fascination/infatuation with Bic Benedict's wife, Leslie, and the ""rest of the story"".

George Stevens was one of a kind during his eara - directing through his infallible skill in casting such wonderful films as ""Shane"" and ""Hud"" into the legends they are today.  The scene most poignant for me was the one later in life, as the self-made, successful, debauched misfit, Jett Rink, veteran of the wages of life and liquor makes his sheepish and hesitant bid for the hand of the daughter of the woman he has loved and lusted after from afar throughout his life. Pining eternally for something more he yearns for but cannot have, Jett sees his chance a generation later but he still can't pull it off.  I was struck by the sheer artistry employed by George Stevens in directing the girl in role of Leslie Bendict's daughter as she tries to find something she likes in Jett besides his money and the fact her father detests him. It is eerie!  The mannerisms, the voice, the mental frame of mind, even the timbre of the voice tumbles out of the past at Jett Rink as they sit at the table.  In a pitiful, painful way,it is romantic, moving. (the book itself paints a far less romantic version of Jett Rink's adoration for Leslie)

When the book first came out, it was critiqued as being slanted against Texas, but I felt it was a balanced act, depicting very fairly the views that might have been taken by a ""tenderfoot"" from the East, who was arriving from a vastly different culture, and trying to adjust to not only the landscape, but the food, the people, the purpose.  If you look closely, there were subtle truths abounding throughout the pages, as both of these vastly different people adjusted to each other, and managed to love each other despite those differences.

The movie also dealt with a variety of then-controversial subjects beyond Big Oil Wells and Big Cattle ranches; such as class disparity coloring even such basics as a visit from a doctor; wealth without conscience; the ravages of war; sassy women who have forgotten their place in a man's world; and of interracial marriage.  Jordan Benedict (Bic), discovers to his chagrin there are a lot of things he cannot control with money and power; he, after a lifetime of vigorous bigotry, finds himself possessed rather unceremoniously of an educated, but nonetheless of Spanish descent daughter-in-law!  He bears up under this indignity rather grudgingly - until the time he and the mixed family he has come to accept run afoul of a restaurateur who makes disparaging remarks about Bic's baby grandchild.  A ""rowdy rhubarb"" of epic Texan proportions ensues, and when the last table is shattered, the restaurant owner beats the tar out of Bic, but it was worth it; he comes to understand at last that blood is thicker than water even if it is mixed up slightly.

Both book and movie are unforgettable.",1295395200,,3642,4.737341772151899

822978,5,6304239149,"This review is a response to all the comments/reviews made about how unhappy everyone is regarding Warner Bros. not enhancing GIANT for widescreen tv playback...

GIANT was shot in the native aspect ratio of 1.66:1.  Basically means, it's just slightly ""wider"" than standard 1.33:1 aka: 4x3 (standard television box). Furthermore, shooting at 1.66:1 is a ""non-anamorphic"" format. There is no ""squeezing"" a wider image on the film negative - then unsqueezing when projected.

This DVD of GIANT presents the film as it was intended. If WB enhanced the picture for 16x9, then we'd actually lose a lot of the picture (from the top and bottom). The composition of the film is designed for the 1.66:1 frame perfectly.

Generally speaking...
Films that are shot 1.85:1 are anamorphic (but not always) thus, can be enhanced for widescreen tv playback.
Films that are shot 1.78:1 (which is the exact aspect ratio of today's HiDef screens, can be enhanced for widescreen tv playback.
Films that are shot 2.35:1 or 2.40:1 are anamorphic (but not always) thus, can be enhanced for widescreen tv playback.
Usually, films that are shot full-frame, 1.33:1 or 1.66:1 are non-anamorphic and should not be enhanced for widescreen (thus cutting off the tops and bottoms of the image).

Two examples of non-anamorphic films (but are still enhanced for widescreen tvs):
1.) Kubrick's ""EYES WIDE SHUT""-- shot full-frame: 1.33:1 (yes, that's 4x3) standard television. For theatrical distribution, they ""matted"" the tops and bottoms to create a 1.85:1 ratio. The remastered special edition of ""EYES WIDE SHUT"" is enhanced for 16x9; just so you know, you're actually getting less picture. The original DVD release presents it in full-frame, as Kubrick intended (in fact, it even says it before the movie begins).

2.) Robert Altman's ""SHORT CUTS"", presented in 2.35:1 ratio is actually non-anamorphic. Again, shot full-frame, then matted it for the desired 2.35:1 ratio. Why? Because at that time, when movies hit videos they would do this awful process called Pan&Scan. Shooting it full frame would keep their desired composition by just removing the mattes from the top and bottom of the screen.

So why is GIANT non-anamorphic? Well, you'll just have to ask director, George Stevens... but he'll tell you that he wasn't crazy about this new gizmo called, ""Cinemscope"" (aka: anamorphic lenses/widescreen)... plus, he wanted to give GIANT a ""tall"" feeling opposed to a ""wide"" feeling. But he changed his mind when he made THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, shooting anamorphic 2.20:1.

Kazan, wanted EAST OF EDEN to have that wide yet claustrophobic feeling so he chose to shoot Cinemascope, 2.35:1 as did Nicholas Ray for his films, like REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and BIGGER THAN LIFE.

823092,4,6304239149,"1.) The audio is pretty good (some of the music is so famous such that anyone born and raised in Texas in the
  past 50 years probably knows it without even realizing it) but the picture image quality has not fared so
  well. Another reviewer theorized that the DVD was made from a 3rd or 4th generation copy. About that I don't
  know but the result is that some of the imagery is not as good as it should be. (Example : In the opening
  shot a watering pond for cattle (in Texas it's known as a 'tank') is shown. The color is faded and not clear
  making one wonder how the opening scene looked to theater audiences 50 years ago.)

  2.) I think that some of the acting is overdone and the attempt to 'act like Texans' causes some of the scenes
  to be almost comical (you have to 'stand back' and think about how the scenes strike you). Now, having said
  that, I will also say that some of the scenes are so 'classic' that they make up for shortcomings of other
  scenes. (Example: When James Dean shows-up covered in oil after his first well comes in, it seems exactly
  what anyone would do when everyone else figured that he would 'lose-his-shirt'.)

The overall 'look-and-feel' of 'Giant' is so much larger-than-life that its strenghts overcome its shortcomings.
If heroic music gets you excited, and the thought of a horizon that stretches further than seems reasonable
makes you want to get in your car and 'head west', then you've got to see 'Giant'.

823095,4,6304239149,"In GIANT, the last entry of James Dean's motion picture trilogy, he portrays Jeff Rink, an oil rig worker who acquires a piece of land, sets out on his own, strikes oil and eventually becomes a petroleum multi-millionaire. On the night of the triumphant opening of his magnificent airport/hotel complex some years later, Rink boozes himself into oblivion and shocks the attending crowd with an incoherent podium speech. (Note: Dean's inebriated ramblings were dubbed by Nick Adams.)

Here, Dean enthusiastically chews scenery and everything in sight; thus he's the best-remembered part of a story that's primarily about the Benedicts, 'Bick' (Rock Hudson) and Leslie (Elizabeth Taylor), and the contrasts between their old money elegance and the nouveau riche vulgarity of Dean's.

A sweeping Edna Ferber melodrama as big as the Lone Star State itself that's directed by George Stevens, ""Giant"" unfolds more slowly than most newer films. Despite great scenery, cinematography, sets, a strong cast and fine music score, because of its leisurely pace this epic hasn't held up as well (in my opinion) as Dean's penultimate effort,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REBEL-WITHOUT-A-CAUSE/dp/B0007US7EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE</a>&nbsp;(1955).

This means that unless it is expanded (which ruins both the color and the clarity) the picture will be crunched. Many older films (Gigi for one which came out around the time of Giant) have been issued in an anamorphic format, so why not Giant? An anamorphic format can be played on a  4 by 3 TV or a widescreen TV equally well but an LBX can be played well only on a 4 by 3 TV.

The fact that I'm not American and search for America in Queens, New york? Or am I sounding a tad too self...

I know this is in colour but off late,I am trying to watch as many as black and white films as I can because there lies a certain substance in these films which the newer film-makers seem to have forgotten to showcase or maybe just what was primarily important for someone in the 1950's somehow seems so much concise and apt. There seemed to be structure, belief, hope and though I've always been a big individualist, I feel newer films are based more on an individual, self-indulgent level.

I only saw it recently. What an outstanding epic of sorts.

 James Dean was a awesome actor, and very handsome! I though everyone acting in this movie did a outstanding job, that's what made the movie so great! It keeps your attention!

It is about a rich, handsome cattleman named Jordan(Rock Hudson) from Texas, who owns a ranching empire named Reatta, who travels to England to buy a horse, and falls in love with the horse owner's, very beautiful daughter Leslie (Elizabeth Taylor). For Jordan and Leslie ,it is love at first sight, and they get married, and go back to Texas! But in Texas Leslie has to face alot of changes, and old traditions, and has to deal with a sister in law that does not like her at all!

 Jordan(ROCK) likes having things his way, and sticking to old traditions, and Leslie lets Jordan know that she has a mind of her own! He is stubborn, and she is stubbon! It is fun too watch Rock and Elizabeth in this movie!

But things start changing when oil is discovered on Reatta, especially for Jordan,  and Leslie, and Jett(James Dean)! Jordan could care less about oil, he is a cattleman, but Jett feels totally different about it! I highly recommend this movie! It is one of my all-time favorites!",1232323200,,1403,4.5436507936507935

823356,4,6304239149,"Everything about this movie just like Texas is huge.  From the more than 3 hour film length to the scope of the screenplay which covers a span of a few decades to track the growth of a state of the union as well as that of the family life and the world view of the Benedicts.  Bick Benedict takes a wife from the North i.e. Virginia which provides life back at his home ranch in the South a little more spice than even he had imagined.

I enjoyed the way the film tackled issues such as racial, social and gender discrimination throughout and I was hit by the irony of how James Dean's character Jet Rink himself an early victim of social discrimination could in turn when he eventually makes it really big practice hypocritically racial discrimination himself.  This is a truly epic film with excellent acting by all the cast and excellent background settings including a masterful effort at directing by George Stevens.

This dvd version is also a treat for fans with bonus features galore with documentaries and especially interviews of the cast which I found very entertaining.  The picture quality is also very good with hardly any noticeable flaws although the sound quality while good could be enhanced further.  Should this film ever make it to Blu-ray, I hope they will take the opportunity to improve upon the sound quality options to include Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround versions as well.

823497,5,6304239149,"I have seen the movie ""Giant"" three times now and am always surprised at how well it holds up each time I see it. Although it is almost three hours and a half in length, the time passes quickly. Based on Edna Ferber's novel by the same name and directed by George Stevens who won the 1956 Oscar as best director, the film, set in the first half of this century covers two generations of Texans: rancher Bick Benedict (Rock Hudson), his feisty wife Leslie (Elizabeth Taylor), and their children played by Carol Baker and Dennis Hopper. We should not forget James Dean as Jeff Rink in this his great but final role before his death at 23. Mercedes McCambridge also plays Bick's no-nonsense sister Luz and a very young Sal Mineo plays Angel, the Mexican worker at Bick's ranch, the Reata, who goes off to fight in World War II.

Everything about this film is big: its length, the landscape-- much of it beautifully photographed-- and certainly stars with the physical attractiveness of Taylor, Hudson and Dean are bigger than we, the sublunaries. The plot is both grand and straightforward. Bick falls in love with Leslie at first sight, takes her from her home in Maryland-- where he has gone to buy a horse from her father-- to his huge spead in Texas. There she struggles with male attitudes towards both women and children-- husbands should be lord of their castles and the owners of both their wives and children-- as well as the prevailing racism lodged at Mexicans and Mexican Americans. For my money, Rock Hudson is a far better actor than critics usually are willing to admit. Elizabeth Taylor of course plays the Southern belle role, the steel magnolia, that she repeated again and again until she finally almost because a caricature. James Dean makes us wonder about what kind of great actor he would have become, had he lived.

Two things always stand out when I watch this movie. One will make you smile; the second will make you sad. The characters in this film essentially grow old by having their hair died grey. We know what Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor looked like as they aged; they did not look like Bick and Leslie with grown children. The second-- the racism towards Latinos. It is so raw and jarring in the film, but sad to say, too many Latinos, particularly Mexicans and Mexican Americans are still treated badly. While the movie's treatment of racism must have been much ahead of its time when it was released in 1956, unfortunately the film's message is still all too relevant today.

""Giant"" made the list of 100 best movies published by the American Film Institute in 2000. It really is a classic.",1184716800,,2627,4.657327586206897

Hollywood's best (Elizabeth Taylor at an age my generation won't recognize, and Dennis Hopper in a surprise smaller role) play in this story that confronts big topics such as inter-generational transfer, racism, and faulty attempts at personal growth.

823574,4,6304239149,"""Giant"" met the lush, sprawling Edna Ferber novel on its own level... Detailing the history of a Texas royal family, the movie, like the novel, is a monument to myths about Texas size, wealth, and vulgarity...

A well-bred lady from Virginia, Liz is the outsider who marries the big, strong, thick-headed ruler of a family dynasty (Rock Hudson) and who stubborn1y refuses to lose her own notions of right and wrong...

In choosing as his bride this independent woman who won't conform to Texas folkways, Hudson selected a wily and persevering antagonist, a lady with a mind of her own who challenges, and loves him every step of the way... At the end, when he fights the owner of a roadside diner who will not serve his Mexican daughter-in-law and grandchild, Liz can count the twenty-five-year battle hers... Playing the liberal to her husband's reactionary, she's succeeded finally in educating her man... It's one of the few occasions when Taylor's the wise teacher rather than the recalcitrant pupil...

The marriage--a prototype for the Taylor mnage, in which tenderness and turbulence are closely mixed--is set against the evolution of Texas from old-fashioned to modern... As horse-loving Virginia deb, as new bride, as threat to her husband's mannish domineering sister, as young wife and mother, as patrona of the ranch who would rather talk politics with the men than chit-chat with the women, as the unattainable mistress of Jett Rink's dreams, as dignified, middle-aged champion of American-Chicano integration, Liz is at the center of the epic canvas, and it's a wise and charming performance...

This movie is so rich in detail, storytelling, and acting. Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean were outstanding in their performances, and eventhough Mercedes McCambridge had a small role I liked what she represented, strength and fierce independence!!!",1164499200,,469,5.438356164383562
823576,5,6304239149,"I normally shy away from movies that run so long, this one over three hours. I also have never really enjoyed myself when watching an Elizabeth Taylor film. However, I felt the need to watch the last of James Dean's films and decided to pop it on just to see if it was worth my time. Boy, was it!

Giant is the story of a wealthy family in Texas. It begins with a strapping young man named Jordan Benedict (Rock Hudson) going to the east to buy a stallion. There he meets his future wife Leslie (Elizabeth Taylor) whose fire and sweetness both attract him and confuse him. He takes her back to Texas, a radically new environment. There she meets a competative and difficult man who is envious of her husband in every way, Jett Rink (Dean) and Jordan's stubborn and jealous sister (Mercedes McCambridge). Leslie soon learns that things in Texas are enormously different than that of her old life, but she refuses to completely change. Her compassion for animals and other people including the detitute Mexicans that serve her meets with approval from the audience but distain and confusion from the Texans around her. Years pass, and the Benedicts have children who grow up and turn out to be quite different people than they ever expected them to be.

Aside from the already wonderful list of cast members, all of whom do an amazing job in their roles, Sal Mineo, Jane Withers, and Dennis Hopper also make appearances.

Some might consider this to be a highly politically motivated film, and perhaps it was. There are certainly elements that question unfounded prejudice. However, the film is not high and mighty in the least and much of the story has nothing to do with politics. It is simply a wonderful story told beautifully by director George Stevens and an excellent cast.

There is not even a hint of melodrama in the portrayals of either the villains or the heroes, making it a film that I never tire of watching.  The issue of bigotry is just as relevant today as it was in 1956 when the movie was made and in 1952 when the book was published.  James Dean reveals his true range of acting ability in his portrayal of Jett Rink from a poor and rebellious young kid to a middle-aged oil tycoon.  Rock Hudson's portrayal of a rich Texas patriarch is quite realistic, despite the overly romantic roles he usually played.  Elizabeth Taylor, too, is convincing as a young woman from a family of privilege in Maryland adjusting to life in the modern west without sacrificing any of the values she had acquired while growing up.  Everyone in this film does not appear to be ""acting.""

823580,5,6304239149,"It's very easy to forget that this wonderful, entertaining, and nostalgic epic film won George Stevens an Oscar.  As the special features included in the set indicate, Stevens was a very special director who enjoyed a long, productive, and rewarding career.  Prior to World War II, Stevens directed mostly comedies and did quite well, particularly when he worked with Hepburn and Tracy on ""Woman of the Year.""  Wartime service, where he produced a number of special films using Kodachrome film, changed Stevens greatly, especially when he saw the atrocities in the German concentration camps.

His films after World War II were dramas, often with a harder edge than he had used before.  This was particularly true of his memorable adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy,"" which became known as ""A Place In The Son.  ""Giant,"" however, does have some comic moments, as well as very moving ones.

My parents and I first saw ""Giant"" when it was released in 1956.  It was a very BIG film, in many ways, and yet it had an intimacy and personality rare for epic productions running more than three hours.  In so many ways, the film epitomized the changing values of family life in the mid-1950's.  One must really view the film as it was intended, a virtual time capsule of a much different time.  Watching the film again in the excellent restored version in this DVD set, we couldn't help but notice one scene that clearly showed Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson sleeping in twin beds, so typical of the old-fashioned morality imposed on most movies and television programs of that era because of strict censorship.

Yet the film was daring for its time.  Elizabeth Taylor is an independent, strong-willed, and determined woman, who is not afraid to stand up to her husband, wonderfully portrayed by Rock Hudson in perhaps the best role of his career.  She is not prejudiced and befriends the Mexican workers and their families, who live and work on the huge Reata ranch in west Texas.  Eventually she convinces her husband that he is wrong, that the Mexicans deserve to be treated better.  One of her sons, portrayed by a young Dennis Hopper, even marries a pretty Mexican-American woman.  That sets the stage for Hudson's memorable confrontation with a bigoted restaurant owner near the end of the film.

In 1956, many of us were intrigued by the final film appearance of James Dean, who had been killed in an automobile accident on September 30, 1955, near the town of Cholame, California, at the age of 24.  The incredible interest in Dean, even after his death (or perhaps because of it), amazed me at the time.  He had already become an icon for millions of young Americans, who saw him as the first actor who really depicted the very struggles they were facing in a constantly changing world.  Yet the film shows Dean aging, well beyond his actual lifespan; it is fascinating to watch him appear with gray hair and to become a rather pathetic figure, despite all his wealth, as he continues to lose control due to over-drinking.  Amazingly, when Dean's Jett Rink passed out at a fancy banquet and reception in his honor, he was mumbling so badly that Stevens discovered, too late, that someone would have to rerecord Dean's dialogue.  Reportedly Dennis Hopper was chosen to imitate Dean's voice because the young actor had died soon after filming ended.  For his excellent work, Dean received a posthumous Oscar nomination.

Overall, the film is a high mark in George Stevens' career.  The values he believed in are clearly represented here and this remains a very moving story, possibly surpassing Edna Ferber's original book.  Stevens would only make three more films after ""Giant,"" perhaps because Hollywood and America changed so dramatically in the years following ""Giant"" and it became increasingly difficult for the director to find suitable stories.  Fortunately, ""Giant"" is a great testament to the great care that Stevens put into his films and we can enjoy it again and again in this beautifully restored version.

The DVD set includes two documentaries made in 1996, on the 40th annviersary of the film's release.  They include fascinating interviews with some of the stars of the film, as well as people in the town of Marfa, Texas, were much of the film was shot.  It is particularly poignant to hear the recollections about James Dean, who was clearly very talented and showed great promise before his life was tragically cut short.  His death shocked and upset so many people and, even 40 years later, was still difficult for some of his costars to discuss.

There is also a kinescope of the world premiere at the Roxy Theatre in New York, taken from the special telecast of the now-defunct Dumont television network.  The program was hosted by Chill Wills and Jayne Meadows and includes brief comments by some of the stars, as well as director George Stevens and producer Jack Warner, who attempts one of his notoriously bad jokes.  There also appearances by celebrities who attended the premiere.  One is quite impressed with seeing the men in their tuxedos and the women in their fabulous evening gowns and furs.  At one point Jayne Meadows laments that the telecast is not in color because some of the gowns are so colorful and beautiful, a sentiment we can share.  Nevertheless, the rather brief telecast is a reminder of a vanished era, of which ""Giant"" itself is a product, that will probably never return, despite the efforts of some to bring back ""the good ol' days.""",1152057600,,5508,4.863879957127546

823582,3,6304239149,"In a recent review of Edna Ferber's novel, WASHINGTON POST book critic Jonathan Yardley states flat-out that the movie far surpasses the book.  That wouldn't be difficult.  You've got gorgeous scenery, James Dean and the lucious Liz Taylor, and Carole Baker and Dennis Hopper in good early performances.  Even Rock Hudson, though still in earnest weeper mold, isn't overly annoying.

The problem with the film is that Dean's charismatic performance has to fight against the script, which requires him to be the villain of the piece.  He is so appealing and poignant as the smart, lonely ranch hand who knows he's better than the smug ranch family he works for that when he's suddenly required to be a racist jerk, it just doesn't feel right.

That said, Dean is wonderful most of the time, from the early scene where he entertains Taylor at his painfully-shabby little house to the moment when he defiantly relaxes in Hudson's touring car, smoking a cigarette, to the moment when, drenched with oil from his first gusher, he races over to Hudson's ranch house, tells him off, and slugs him for good measure.

As for Taylor, she is simply delightful as the pretty girl from Virginia who may move to Texas but refuses to behave like Texas women are supposed to--in the middle of one fight, she reminds Hudson that she'd WARNED him she was an awful woman, and then smiles and wins the argument yet again.  She eventually even conquers his inborn racism and inspires him to duke it out with the owner of a greasy spoon who refuses their Mexican daugther-in-law service.

But that scene is also a mark of what is wrong with the film; like far too many films of the period, it portrays racism as something residing only among the poor and uneducated, when in fact it was top-down infection, even a good strategy to keep poor whites and poor blacks from teaming up to take on their real enemy.  But the flaws can't keep this from being an enjoyable film.",1149897600,,1947,4.683284457478006
823732,3,6304239149,"The ""Giant"" in the title would be Texas, the story an epic detailing the life of a rich Texan land owner, his family, and associates.  What begins as definitely a giant production, what with large music, large sets, panaramic views, and a massive land to cover unfortunately rushes through a bit too much information over its three hour plus period, but maintains its pace via a daring most films of the time didn't have.

The daring I speak of begins right from the beginning with Elizabeth Taylor basically criticizing Texan history right in front of the Texan character Rock Hudson.  But soonafter follows a love and family story as Leslie is meant to see it in all of its large, 525,000 acre glory.

We stay relatively happily with this couple and the pending drama of a young hand Jett (James Dean) before the story goes into rush mode.  This is definitely a situation where the book had a lot of stuff to cover, and the movie had to cover important parts with only a passing glance.  It's a testament to George Stevens' skill that we're able to get the idea via the quick shot to an important plot point before the movie moves on, but it has the unfortunate side effect of disallowing the real drama to build.  Scenes that are supposed to create a major change for the characters, like finally transitioning from cattle to oil, are ended without a moment of exploration into what it actually means for the characters themselves.  Marriages that are supposed to present controversy are sudden and relationships are developed in less than two minutes of screentime.  It gets rather difficult to truly appreciate what's going on for all of the characters.

On the other hand, the movie still is able to present characters, and presents them in a way that is endearing while still taking the time to comment on controversial issues.  Feminism, interracial marriage and prejudice, and the overarching theme of the transition from Big Cattle to Big Oil (think of it as an agrarian-to-industrial transition, if you must transplant its themes to a more worldwide scope) keep this movie from being anything like boring or tedious.  The performances are also key in maintaining attention, and indeed every character, even the ones that do things we don't like, are in the end completely relatable.

I wouldn't call it a landmark of film, but I can definitely see why it has and will stick around for a while.

The story is really good and the social implications and the racism issues that are thrown in are really interesting and make it more than just a fluff piece. It is the story of a young girl (Elizabeth Taylor) who is from a wealthy family who falls in love with a guest (Rock Hudson) who is from old rich Texas money. She decides to go off with him and get married and move to Texas and to his sprawling ranch. She is completely out of her element at first because this is a real working ranch and she is being pampered but she eventually wants to be out working and being part of things much to the dismay of the old hardass woman who ""runs things"" around the ranch. She eventually fits right in and starts befriending and helping some of the local indians and Mexicans much to the dismay of eveybody because of the class distinctions that were still in place. She also meets and befriends a young man whose family owned a little patch of dirt adjacent to Rocks ranch. The young guy is James Dean. Dean falls hard for her but is backward and shy. There is a lot of friction between Dean and Rock over Taylor and over the fact that Dean is poor white trash. Dean hits it big when his pathetic oil well actually hits black gold. He eventually becomes even more rich and powerfull than Rock.

The movie spans many years and the characters all age into their sixties. Rock and Taylor pull it off much better than a very young James Dean in make up trying to be 60. Dennis Hopper has a great roll as the son of Rocks character who never lived up to the macho image but goes his own way and becomes a doctor. He also marries a Mexican girl which stirs up a lot of trouble with him 'mixing races' which was a no no back then especially but not exclusively to the upper class in that some of the towns people even are biggoted toward the marraige.

823738,5,6304239149,"This weekend marks the 50th anniversary of actor James Dean's tragic auto accident-September 30, 1955.  He had no less than three masterpieces made when he died-EAST OF EDEN in release, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE about to be released (or vice-versa), and GIANT in post-production.  Impressively, he netted two Best Actor Oscar nominations in consecutive years (1955-1956).  To mark Dean's death, the opulent Castro Theater in San Francisco is having a James Dean mini-film festival over the weekend.

I believe all three of these movies are on letterboxed DVD, though most people erroneously think George Stevens' GIANT (1956) is in wide-screen; it is not, just a mere 1.66:1 ratio.  I recommend it to you this weekend on double disk DVD or videocassette for its 50th birthday.  It is a modern western from Edna Ferber's episodic novel, set in 1940's and 1950's Texas.  It is a Texas of oil wells and land, not big cities, with location work in the little Panhandle town of Marfa.  A big mansion sits like an anachronism in the middle of prairie.  Cattleman Bick Benedict (Rock Hudson at his best) marries the beautiful city girl Leslie (luscious Elizabeth Taylor).  Watching them, often with grease and dirt on his jeans, is drifter Jett Rink (James Dean).

As the 1940's blend into the 1950's, this huge and sprawling 201 minute masterpiece turns Bick and Leslie into parents:  sons cattleman Earl Holliman and doctor Dennis Hopper.  Bick warms to Holliman, but wants nothing to do with a son who wants to be a doctor, especially one who treats nearby Mexicans, whom Bick has contempt for. (""Leslie, those people have their own doctor.""  ""THOSE people, THEIR doctor, OUR doctor, what does that mean?"" says Leslie with disgust at her racist husband.)  Independent Leslie sides with Hopper and even goes with him when an Obregon baby gets sick on Mexican land.  Meanwhile, Jett Rink has been given a small piece of land on the large Rietta ranch, an inheritance when a close friend dies.  The land sprouts oil gushers and Jett eventually becomes rich.

After an intermission around the 110 minute mark of this very engrossing movie that won Strevens a Directing Oscar (and a whopping NINE other nominations!), we are one generation further.  Doctor Hopper has married a Mexican wife, and they have a cute Mexican baby; even the little baby earns Bick's contempt.  But so does rancher son Holliman's daughter (Carroll Baker).  She is getting romantic with an aging millionaire Jett Rink, who bears an uncanny resemblence to Howard Hughes. Jett is rotting before our eyes; it is a stunning James Dean performance that probably should have won a Best Actor Oscar.  We are following a Texas family over several generations, as Bick slowly grows to admire and even like Mexicans, particularly his little grandson in a memorable diner scene.

With glorious music by Dimitri Tiomkin, and a screenplay by Fred Guiol and Ivan Moffat, GIANT is a stupendous filmmaking achievement if you can do its 3 hours and 21 minutes in one long night.  But two nights is still workable for such an episodic and sprawling family saga.  You may need a THIRD night for all the DVD extras on this valentine to Texas--B&W TV programs on location in Marfa for filming exteriors; an audio commentary by no less than critic Stephen Farber, writer Moffat, and George Stevens, Jr;  a documentary appreciation for George Stevens by directors who knew him; Hollywood and New York premieres on kinescope; original and reissue theatrical trailers; publicity material and poster art; and reflections on the film's enduring legacy after half a century.

Whether you watch it to honor George Stevens' directorial artistry, maybe Rock Hudson's best performance, a Texas-style birthday party, or as a remembrance of James Dean's untimely death and staggering talent, GIANT is one heck of a western epic and family saga.  In fact, it is probably worth owning on DVD because you will watch it often, especially with so many marvelous bonuses.  Here is to GIANT's 50th birthday!",1127865600,,4029,4.9895209580838324

Leslie, after a rough start, proves herself quite the force of nature. Ranch hand Jett Rink (James Dean) falls into unrequited love with Leslie, uttering, in one scene, one of my favorite lines in the film, something like, ""Mrs. Benedict, you sure do look right good enough to eat, yeah, good enough to eat...."" (voice trails off and he looks like he's going to lick his lips) - and then when he strikes it rich with oil, he takes his bitterness out in several ways.

With a stellar supporting cast including Mercedes McCambridge, Sal Mineo, Carroll Baker, and Dennis Hopper, ""Giant"" is the original miniseries before anyone knew what a miniseries even was...except this is of course a classic film of the big screen, not a TV movie.

Directed by George Stevens, the sprawling epic (201 minutes, but it goes fast, believe me) beautifully covers two generations of family and a variety of issues, including marriage, family, childraising, social snobbery and racism, the latter two being covered especially well. When in the mood for a well-paced, involved, alternately funny, sad, heartwarming, and emotionally fulfilling epic, ""Giant"" always fits the bill for me.

My favorite bit of trivia - Liz Taylor and Rock Hudson became fast friends on the set, and indulging together in partying/drinking binges most every night, after filming stopped. In the scene where the two are watching a marriage, the two actors had to stop during the filming several times to take turns going outside to throw up, as both were terribly hungover from the previous night's revelries.",1125360000,,1834,5.00327868852459

Too bad Dame Elizabeth Taylor couldn't be a part of the commentary...she is really marvelous in the picture, as are most everyone.  George Stevens Jr. lends great sentimentality, insight and credibility to the entire project.

The beautifully executed themes on feminism and racial prejudice are more timeley than ever.  Rock Hudson, in arguably the best acting performance of his career, does a marvelous job of transitioning from a ""good old boy,"" to a more enlightened, open minded individual.  It's ironic that his own repressed sexuality caused him to be ultimately less enlightened than that of the character which earned him an Oscar nomination.

James Dean, as in his two previous motion pictures, displays an uncanny ability and presence that add to and reinforce his mystique as one of our greatest acting icons of the screen.

Leslie is an outcast at first, but she slowly begins incorporating herself into the society in which she has moved teaching kindness and compassion to her lunkhead of a husband along the way. The movie follows their relationship and the growth of their family through about 30 years of marriage.

GIANT is a visually spectacular movie. Though the film's scenery isn't it's best feature, it adds a lot to the film's substance. The acting is very well done, especially by Taylor and James Dean.  GIANT is probably best known as Dean's last movie (he was killed before the picture was even released).  Dean plays Jet Fink, the lead secondary character in the picture--a man fighting against the world to make a name for himself and always playing second fiddle to Jordan Benedict. Rock Hudson does a decent job of acting in the film, but he is upstaged every time that James Dean appears in a scene. The real-life animosity that Hudson felt towards Dean adds a great deal of texture to their performances and makes the rough relationship between Jordan Benedict and Jet Fink even that much more realistic. Taylor holds her ground with Dean perfectly capturing the sexual tension between the two.  Besides those three, there really aren't any other standout performances.

Unlike many epic movies that focus on nations, empires, or dynasties (both literally and metaphorically), GIANT chooses to tell the tale of the generation of one family, and specifically one couple. It's more a film about love and family than it is about cattle, oil, big business, or money. That's really nice to see for a change.  After all, even though most of us probably aren't as materially blessed as the Benedicts, we all live epic stories.",1099094400,,2290,4.851282051282051
823854,1,6304239149,"The product information here should be carefully read, as it reveals that this edition of Giant has been transferred in a 1:1.66 letterbox transfer. This is a travesty. Giant was filmed and released in the classic 1:1.33 ""Academy"" aspect ratio, which also happens to be the aspect ratio for NTSC analog television. George Stevens disliked widescreen processes, although he was forced to use them by studios on later films.
The time has come to put a stop to these unnecessary, phoney ""restored"" versions of classics. It's just a marketing ploy to squeeze more money out of old warhorses. Going back to the good old days of the laserdisc, I never much cared about the extras that were first introduced by Criterion and later imitated by the major studios. I've always responded to a high quality video transfer taken from the best film elements available. Getting the aspect ratio wrong and mutilating the images of Steven's classic film makes everything else irrelevant.
Thank goodness I still have my laserdiscs. Failing that, grab a copy on VHS.",1084838400,,1047,4.988571428571428
823855,5,6304239149,"The DVD is superb -- I do not know what all the complaints about sound, etc. are all about! My goodness, this film is almost 50 years old -- and I think it is in wonderful shape!
I purchased this video because I have become a big James Dean film, but the acting of Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Carol Baker, and Dennis Hopper were splendid.
To think that Hudson was a mere 29, Taylor 23, and Dean 23 and could play characters who age 30 years with such reality is a true testament to their genius!  Of course, the makeup artists must also receive recognition.
The most disturbing portion of the film to me is when Hudson confronts ""Sarge"" the restaurant owner in a fist fight and when ""Sarge"" lands into the juke box, ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" begins to play. However, this epic film is full of irony and subtle twists and nuances -- to really grasp the entire message this film needs to be viewed more than one time.
The irony of the Mexican children singing The National Anthem during the funeral of Angel (played by a very young Sal Mineo) touched me. Little Angel was a person who died for the United States and yet was the focus of bigotry from his impoverished birth until his death.
Or course, in my opinion, there was and never will be another James Dean -- it is heartbreaking to watch this dramatic genius in the final film performance before his untimely demise. Like Buddy Holly, I will always wonder where Dean's career would have gone.
Carol Baker is fantastic in her first film role and the very young Dennis Hopper's performance is equally memorable.
This film speaks to the injustices of racial bigotry that unfortunately will always exist except in a utopian world.
The additions to this DVD make it a must-buy!
Please don't hesitate to purchase -- this DVD is worth every penny -- and then some!
Oh, the editorial review refers to Elizabeth Taylor as a Southern Belle and this is incorrect.  Leslie Benedict is from Maryland and even makes the comment to Hudson and his crownies that she was from the ""Center of Politics"" when Hudson tries to push her aside so the men can talk ""Business and Politics"".",1082592000,,2123,4.54046997389034

In several scenes, you can actually see flashes of lines, as if the print was lifted off a television screen.  There was NO attempt to upgrade, enhance or preserve this wonderful, classic film.  The extras?  Nothing special.  Certainly not worth the cost of buying this terrible DVD expecting a top grade enhancement and then finding that you have something that wouldn't even be shown on TCM!  My question is, where did TCM get THEIR print??  Please heed this advice.  Buy the 1985 VHS tape before you waste your money on what has to be one of the worst rip-offs in DVD retail yet.

823941,2,6304239149,"The two stars that I rate this DVD is simply for the terrible transfer of this classic motion picture. This movie is a 10 star movie, but this particular DVD release is simply terrible. It seems as if they used third generation, or even fourth generation negatives to create this transfer, with absolutely no regard for consistancy. Some scenes are tolerable, at best, and seem that the transfer might have come from a decent third generation negative, and some scenes are totally dismal and seem as if they were done from a fourth generation negative that was found on the cutting room floor. There is absolutely no consistancy of the colors and brightness from one scene to another. But this is only the half of it. The transfer to this disc was done in a near full screen picture which cuts so much of the scenery off of the sides of every frame. It was a shame how this disc was done. This beautiful Hollywood epic deserves such better treatment. The roles played by Rock Hudson, James Dean and Elizabeth Taylor are classic Hollywood roles, and the original shooting of this epic was done in a beautiful way, (which you can enjoy on laserdisc if you find a copy.) This movie tells the story of racial injustice and trys to teach a morality lesson of racial tolerence, all set in the by-gone days of depression era rural Texas. The story of us-and-them as played out by Mexicans and Anglos, and as seen through the eyes of Hollywood, dosen't get any better than this motion picture. For that reason alone, if you really must own this movie, buy this DVD. Otherwise you would be better off waiting for a better transfer or buying a good used copy on laserdisc or buying this movie on the 1985 VHS put out by Warner Brothers, (do not buy any VHS tape of this movie other than the 1985 version, the rest were terrible).

823943,1,6304239149,"""Giant"" is the epic western drama directed by George Sidney.  Based on the book by Edna Ferber, the film deals with racial intolerance and sexual repression - both taboo subjects of the day.  The film stars Rock Hudson as Bick Benedict, a lumbering cattle rancher from Texas who's new bride (Elizabeth Taylor) is torn between her loyalty to her husband and her own strong will.  James Dean, in his final role before his untimely death, is electrifying as Jett Rink, a poor boy come to greatness that ultimately seduces him to the dark side of wealth.  Mercedes McCambridge, Chill Wills and Jane Withers all give stellar performances.
Warner Home Video's 2 disc DVD is A GIANT DISAPPOINTMENT!  The transfer, long available in Canada as a single, double sided disc, is tired worn and horribly out of focus.  It is NOT ANAMORPHICALLY ENHANCED for widescreen televisions.  Colors are muddy, dull and, on occasion, bleed into one another.  Flesh tones are way too orange.  Black levels are a muddy brown at best.  Aliasing, shimmering, edge enhancement and pixelization all intrude.  The worst factor in this transfer however is the horrible misregistration of the image - creating deeply out of focus images in medium and long shots as well as annoying halos around almost everything.  The sound has been matrixed for stereo but is horribly strident, with scratchy pitch and an abundant amount of background hiss.  There is nothing even remotely engaging about the sound field.
EXTRAS: Enough to make Texas blush.  We get a retro documentary, an intro by George Stevens Jr. some wonderful home movies shot on location, a good stills gallery, the original theatrical trailer and some other toss away junket material including news trailers and radio snippets.
BOTTOM LINE: The extras are the reason ""GIANT"" received a one star rating in this review.  For its transfer quality alone a negative two seems better suited.  Without the extras there is really no reason for Warner Brothers to be celebrating the release of this classic motion picture in its current incarnation on DVD.  What a shame that the studio that funded the movie can't see fit to do it justice for a new generation!

823944,5,6304239149,"Not having read Edna Ferber's novel on which this film is supposedly based, I am obviously unqualified to comment on how faithful it is to the original material. George Stevens directed the film, working with a screenplay co-authored by Fred Guiol and Ivan Moffat. I saw it when it was first released in 1956,  immediately put off by what I viewed as the boorishness of the native Texans, especially Vashti Synthe (Jane Withers) and Uncle Bawley (Cill Wills), who bear at least some resemblance to members of the Jed Clampett family. Then and now, I think  Rock Hudson is only infrequently believable as Bick Benedict. Not so Elizabeth Taylor as Leslie Lynnton Benedict. Gordon Bau and his staff must be faulted for the sometimes ineffective make-up work, notably on the Benedicts and Jett Rink (James Dean) in their later years. At any moment, I expected an elderly and enfeebled Charles Foster Kane to appear, announcing that he is Fuz Benedict, the long-lost cousin of Bick and his sister Luz (Mercedes McCambridge).
While viewing this film again recently, however, I appreciated much more than I had before efforts made in it to address some very important and highly controversial racial issues. Keep in mind that this film was released only two years after the historic Supreme Court decision which declared racial segregation unconstitutional and therefore illegal. At least the larger ranches in the Southwest, plantations in the Deep South, and mining communities in the Southeast were, in effect, empires with well-entrenched and fiercely defended social and economic hierarchies. Throughout all levels, everyone was very class-conscious. Any challenge of the prevailing values was perceived as a threat to the entire culture.
I was fascinated by Bick Benedict's gradual, sometimes grudging acceptance of new perspectives on race and ""place."" That progression is largely explained by his son Jordan's marriage and parenthood. Slights to Jordan's wife prepare us (and Benedict) for the climactic scene in the diner which clearly indicates how significantly his perspectives have changed. Oh sure, his response to the proprietor reflects Benedict's family pride and macho temperament but I think his behavior makes an important statement which brings the film to an appropriate conclusion, one which I had not previously appreciated.
Some portions of Giant still seem corny and mushy to me; other portions seem dated. However, on balance, I think the film makes an important contribution to understanding where our society has been and where it seems to be now so that, hopefully, we will be better-prepared to resolve whichever  issues are still divisive. With all due respect to the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights as well as to the Supreme Court, there are certain matters which can only be affirmed and sustained by the human heart. I was again reminded of that while seeing this film again.",1057536000,,2908,5.196162046908316

Yes--it is long--but there is a story to tell ( remember when movies actually told a story ? ), and the story takes time. The performances by the actors are fine, but--let's face it--long after the movie is over, it is James Dean that is remembered.
James Dean--that incredible talent taken so early in life--James Dean--the young rebel for all eternity.

It seems to me that the theme music for ""Giant"" is still played at many college football games--it clearly still strikes a chord in the hearts of Texans everywhere.

A personal note--if there is one actor who will hopefully some day write an autobiography, it should be Dennis Hopper. For nearly 50 years, this guy has had an incredible career in motion pictures--from acting with James Dean to the present--Dennis just keeps on rolling ! Of course--who am I kidding ? He probably has no time to write a book !

Bottom line--if you collect classic movies, ""Giant"" should be in your home.

Author, Edna Ferbers ""Giant"" is a classic Texas western film of epic length (201 minutes) not since Maragret Mitchells ""Gone With The Wind"" has a books film adaptation been so well received.  4 years in the making Director George Stevens and Warner Brothers produced a monumental history making film.

Summary - An outstanding ensemble cast provides us with a magnificent movie experience.  In short this epic film is about a Texas cattle baron (Rock Hudson - Oscar nominated role ages 30 years) who travels east to evergreen Maryland to buy a champion horse for breeding.  Meets the socalite daughter (Elizabeth Taylor) buys the horse, marries her and they return to his ""Giant"" desolate Texas ranch (596,000 acres).  A family (?) outcast & dirt poor (James Dean - Oscar nominated role) finds Elizabeth desirable and a 30 rivalry of hatred begins.  This complex story shows how family life evolves, survives and how new generations change traditions.  The stars aging 30 year process is amazingly authentic & beleivable.  Multi-plots, colorful characters & vast vistas makes this a classic film.
Get the popcorn ready. Watch the Film Introduction and then prepare to watch this ""GIANT"" 3 1/2 hour western classic.  (This is a flipper disk - so you get a break)

I have been a fan of Giant for many years, and have seen the film many times. I had looked forward to the DVD re-issue, anticipating all the benefits of DVD quality and presentation. What a disappointment this disc has been! Although the blurb for the set describes the film as being transferred from ""revitalized film elements"" it is, as far as I can tell, nothing more than the same video tape that was used for the laserdisc version several years ago.
It is NOT a new digital transfer, and it is NOT anamorphic. Detail is appallingly bad for a DVD, color has been hyped up but surface texture is poor. Zooming the picture to fill a 16:9 screen produces picture quality hardly better than VHS.

824053,5,6304239149,"Those of us who live on the dusty, windswept plains of western Texas and Oklahoma readily appreciate a moving, gripping, well-made film that portrays the harsh, yet aesthetic abundance of this region.  Equally enjoyable is the portrayal of what was once a titanic clash of two industries:  cattle ranching and energy.  Throw three young, very capable actors into the mix, and suddenly you've got an epic as entertaining today as it was forty-plus years ago.
GIANT is the story of a west Texas ranching dynasty, the sprawling Reata Ranch, overseen for generations by the Benedict Family--currently run by Bick Benedict (Rock Hudson).  Bick takes as his bride an ""Easterner,"" petite and pretty Leslie Lynnton Benedict (Elizabeth Taylor).  Leslie's transition from Maryland to the dusty flats of west Texas is the epitome of culture shock, yet she's up to the task, even to the point of challenging the ingrained bigotry toward the local Hispanic population.  Bick's conservative stubbornness is at odds with Leslie's progressive beliefs; their numerous ""disagreements"" are some of GIANT'S most delightful, amusing moments.  Yet the couple endures--endures through love.
Jett Rink (James Dean) is one of Bick's quiet, surly, unreliable ranch hands.  Jett becomes infatuated with Leslie from the first moment he sees her; his attraction to her motivates him to better himself.  Inheriting a patch of land from Bick's older sister, Luz (played wonderfully by Mercedes McCambridge), Jett leaves Reata and does the unthinkable:  he drills for oil.  And when he strikes paydirt--when his first ""gusher"" comes in--the stage is set:  the grand ranching tradition of the Benedict clan versus Jett's rapid accumulation of wealth and power via dotting the west Texas landscape with oilwells.
James Dean simply dominates this film.  The fact that he was able to so completely and effectively portray Jett Rink as a shrewd, hard-drinking businessman when Dean himself was only in his early twenties is astonishing.  The range and complexity Dean brings to this role is spellbinding--and tragic:  tragic in that we are given a glimpse of his phenomenal talent that was extinguished forever in an auto accident before GIANT was even released.
I also enjoyed a very young Dennis Hopper as Jordan Benedict III, Bick's son and reluctant ""heir apparent"" to the family business.  And Chill Wills is a bona fide scene stealer as crusty, cantankerous Uncle Bawley.  He gets the best line in the movie; after Bick angrily rejects Jett's latest offer to drill for oil on his ranch and slams the telephone down, Uncle Bawley quietly says:  ""Most expensive phone call you ever made, Bick.  Probably cost you around a billion dollars.""
GIANT is highly recommended.

824054,4,6304239149,"""Giant"" is a film that is either great or greatly overboiled.  It depends on your mood and your attention span.  ""Giant"" is a long film.  It is based on the hugely popular novel of the same name by Edna Ferber.
It tells the story of Bick Benedict and his family as they move from having one of the largest and most prosperous cattle ranches in the state of Texas to being one of the largest producers of oil in the state.
Visually stunning, ""Giant"" is so grand that it is often too grand for its own good.  Sometimes we are just not able to get close to the characters because they are too broadly drawn and played.  Some of the actors are up to the task of delivering beyond this hinderance, but others aren't.
Rock Hudson as Bick is certainly matinee idol handsome and believable, but he never quite seems to be any more than playing his part.  Elizabeth Taylor is sweet and demure as his East coast bride.  This is one of Taylor's best roles, because she is certainly up for the task.  James Dean, who was highly reviled by the virile Hudson, delivers a perfect performance until the last two reels, when he seems to have become a sad characature of an actor pretending to imitate Marlon Brando.  Mercedes McCambridge as Luz is sheer dynamite.  It is sad that her character is a supporting role and doesn't appear on screen as long as I would have liked.
At its release, ""Giant"" polarized the critics and the fans.  It probably wouldn't get the attention it does if not for it being the last of the only three films that James Dean ever made.  In fact, Dean was already dead by the time the film went into post production.
A bit of trivia:  Dean's last scene in the film had to be dubbed because the actor decided that his character's drunken lines should be delivered garbled.  In reality, they were so garbled that no one could understand a word being said.  Since Dean was no longer alive, the lines had to be voiced over by another actor.
It is impossible to review ""Giant,"" ""East of Eden,"" or ""Rebel Without A Cause"" and not focus on Dean.  It may seem biased or weighed too heavily in his favor, but since his body of work consists of only those three films, it is doubtful any reviewer can separate those films from that actor - nor should they.
While ""Giant"" shows us the greatness of the actor who was James Dean, it also gives us a peek at the troubled soul of a man who was not long for this world.  I've often wondered what Dean would be like today and what roles he would have taken.  Would he still be considered a great actor or would his popularity have faded with age?  It is impossible to know.  It is much easier to remember fondly a person for their famed youth, than to see them over time.  Perhaps, A.E. Houseman said it best in his poem ""To an Athlete Dying Young"":
Smart lad, to slip betimes away
From fields where glory does not stay
And early though the laurel grows
It whithers quicker than the rose.
Eyes the shady night has shut
Cannot see the record cut,
And silence sounds no worse than cheers
After earth has stopped the ears:",1047945600,,3061,4.36331569664903
824055,4,6304239149,"What about this movie isn't big?  Big stars (Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson); big state (Texas); big ranch (2 million acres of prime cattle land), and big length; at 202 minutes, this film runs about 45 minutes too long.  The story is the familiar one about grandiosity run amok; the moral, which has been done to death, is that the simple life is the one best worth living.  We've seen it all before.

So why see this movie?  In two words: James Dean.  In his last film before his tragic death on the Freeway at the age of 24, Dean showed that he was what his legion of fans always claimed: a true genius.  Try to imagine anyone else in the role of Jett Rink , and the character remains a cipher - lifeless, dull, nothing.  It took Dean to bring it to life and make it his own.  In this movie, James Dean and Jett Rink become indistinguishable from each other.  And perhaps only an actor as brilliant as Dean could turn Rink from a character we love in the first half of the film, to a character we hate at the end.  His drunken tirade near the movie's end is a tour de force.

Dean's magnificent performance doesn't take away from the very creditable acting by Rock Hudson as the millionaire rancher Bick Benedict, an incredibly beautiful Elizabeth Taylor as his wife Leslie, the young Sal Mineo, and especially Mercedes McCambridge as Bick's bitter, sexually frustrated sister with an unrequited passion for Jett Rink; but next to Dean's knockout performance, they pale into mere adequacy.  Forget everything else; this is Dean's movie.

this movie Rock Hudson plays the lead role as the Texas Rancher.
He courts and marries Elizabeth Taylor. Carroll Baker and Dennis Hopper play the role of their children. One of the more lasting roles was the character of Jett Rink played by James Dean in his final acting role. Rink strikes oil and becomes a millionaire. This
movie covers life on a Texas ranch. The neighboring rancher is played by Chill Wills. You get a very good history of this ranching family in this movie. It is a giant of a movie in every way.

never forget it.",1046390400,,723,4.443609022556391
824146,5,6304239149,"The 1956 film is aptly named; everything about it is huge. Three years in the making, and a full 202 minutes long, it's the sweeping story of a Texas family that starts in the 1920s.  Elizabeth Taylor is the young bride from East who, after a whirlwind romance with Rock Hudson, comes to his huge 595-acre Texas ranch.  Here, she finds his unwelcoming sister, prejudice against the Mexican servants, and a condescending attitude to her as a woman.  James Dean is here too, a sullen ranch hand who yearns for her as well as wealth.  She's feisty though, as well as beautiful, and the rational center of the film, which spans a quarter of a century, as she and Rock Hudson quarrel, make up and raise their three children.  Texas changes too.  James Dean, the ranch hand, is the first to discover oil, and all of their lives change dramatically then.  After a while all the land in the area is gushing oil wells where cattle used to roam.
During the course of film the makeup changes to show the cast aging, and Elizabeth Taylor, who was only 23 at the time, is shown as a mature woman.  Dennis Hopper plays her grown son and Carol Baker her daughter. There's even a small part for Sal Mineo, who plays a grown up Mexican-American boy.  By then the story is a family saga with the son choosing to be a doctor and the daughter finding the older James Dean an attractive man.  This is the stuff of soap opera, which I usually don't like.  But somehow, I was completely captivated by this film, which shows how everyone's character develops through the years.
I was impressed with the quality of all of the actors, including Mercedes McCambridge, who has a small role as the sister.  Sometimes I forget how talented Elizabeth Taylor is as an actress and even Rock Hudson, who is known for his rather stilted performances, was able to show some real feelings.  James Dean, however, stood out above all the rest.  The scenes he had with Elizabeth Taylor in which he showed his awkward vulnerability were ripe with nuance.  It demanded mastery of his craft.  His performance was indeed outstanding.
However, it is almost half a century since the film was produced.  I now know what Elizabeth Taylor really looks like as a mature woman.  I have to smile at her gray-haired persona in the film, in which she remained slim and elegant.  I can't help thinking about Rock Hudson's super masculine image as he dukes it out in a diner when his Mexican-American daughter-in-law is refused service.  And I'm saddened to think of poor James Dean, who died tragically in a car accident at the age of 23 shortly after the film was made.  His movie image of aging alcoholic millionaire is the only hint we have of what he might have looked like if he lived.  The film even brought out thoughts of our own President Bush, himself a product of a Texas background and his own mixed Mexican-American family.
The video consisted of two reels, and included about an hour's worth of features in addition to the more than three hours of the film itself.  I stayed up late into the night to watch it all, including a short documentary about the small town in Texas in which part of the film was made, an interview with Dimitri Tiomkin who wrote the music for the film, an interview with the son of the director, George Stevens, and a long telecast of opening night both in Hollywood and New York with Jayne Meadows interviewing different stars as they entered the theater.  Although the film itself was in color, all of these features were in black and white and brought back memories of live television shows, bouffant hairdos and mink stoles.
I never saw ""Giant"" when it first came out.  Videos and DVDs were years away in the future and, in those days, if you didn't catch a film in the theaters when it first was released, that was that.  I'm so glad that this film was so easily available all these years later because I totally enjoyed the experience of spending a evening watching it.  I was able to sit back, relax, and return to a time, place and cinematic point of view that doesn't exist anymore.  The world is changed now.  And so have I.  But I absolutely loved this film.

824147,5,6304239149,"I saw Giant in a movie theatre when it first came out in the 1950's.  The movie is epic in proportion and is about 4 hours long.  This is the only movie that I watched back to back 3 times (I went into the movie theatre at noon and came out at midnight).  The story is great, the acting is excellent.  Elizabeth Taylor is at her best and is beautiful as well.  Rock Hudson and James Dean also give stellar performances.  This is one of my favorite movies and has remaind so throughout the years.  I can hardly wait until they release it on DVD, then I will purchase it all over again, and, of course love witching it many more times.",1013990400,,633,4.139344262295082
824148,3,6304239149,"While I'm still working on my glowing review for Rebel Without a Cause, I think I'll do this one for Giant. To say it bluntly, the film left me disturbed and unsettled, as movies generally do when I don't feel they've been finished. Whatever happened to Jett? It's not enough for me to see him lying in a drunken stupor under a fallen table. His part of the story needed to be resolved, and it wasn't. I give this movie three stars only because James Dean was in it. Without him it would have received even fewer. It may just disturb me forever to think that this was his last film and they didn't give his role much to do beyond wearing a cowboy hat. It seemed that for the first tape he had more of a part than the second; even so, you never get to look inside his mind or at his background to see why he did as he did, or anything. James Dean had everything as an actor to make that love triangle powerful and memorable. As it was, he barely had a chance to enter it before he struck oil and seemed to exit the movie and the triangle, almost as if he was simply dispensable. I don't think Jett Rink's part can just be waved off like that. Not that anything can be done now, forty years after Giant's completion. There are a few good things I can say about this movie, and they all pertain to James Dean. I liked the scene when Leslie stopped at his house to have tea with him, and loved when he was reverently gazing at that footprint she left in the mud, watching it slowly fill up with something that wasn't mud, and then just watching him dig into it, exulting in it, practically covering himself with the stuff. Why does that scene have more power than all the rest of the movie put together? And I keep thinking, why did his final appearance have to be as an old drunk? He made the touching if slightly inebriated speech about ''Beautiful Leslie, the woman a man wants, the woman a man has to have'' - and basically disappeared. I can't figure out this movie, and if I watch it again, I'll most likely be FF'ing over anything that isn't pertaining to Jett, so there wouldn't be much point in it. One more thing - I want to go against the grain of most reviewers of this movie and say that I think the fight scene at Sarge's was stupid and dumb and I don't see what the Texan music playing had to do with anything. My recommendation for you? Go rent this movie before buying it. You may love it. I suppose for people who love Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor, this would be wonderful. I only watched it because of James Dean, and as I can't stop saying (you may have noticed) his role was severly neglected and underdeveloped. I think I've made my point. Perhaps someone will benefit from my observations.",1006732800,,2706,4.246124031007752

Everything about ""Giant"" is superb and marvelous. James Dean, Rock Hudson, and Elizabeth Taylor go through three generations in Texas. It's amazing going through the times as they each grow older. The restaraunt scene, where Rock Hudson gets beaten up and knocked around by the owner is unforgettable. It shocked me when Hudson lost the fight, landed in the salad, and the owner throwing a sign on him saying
""We have the right to refuse service to anyone."" ""Giant"" is absolutely marvelous and heartwarming entertainment.",1004140800,,683,5.053097345132743
824151,4,6304239149,"A sweeping epic is the best way to describe Giant.  Everything about the picture is giant.  The sets, the characters, and the landscape.
The story of Giant revolves around Leslie and Jordan Benedict.  Starting when they meet each other and covering their lives through middle age.  Jordan is a third generation cattle rancer in Texas and knows little of anything else.  Leslie, who was raised in Maryland, is not the sort of woman he is used too, but he marries her in haste because he is so facinated by her.  Upon returning to his ranch of more than half a million acres the movie really begins to get going.  And to make no mistake, one of the central characters in this film is Texas and how it changes to change the characters.
A lot of stuff happens in Giant.  Just about every significant event that happens in their lives together, children, fights, death, business, is shown on screen.  This makes for a very complex character study which is why the picture is so long.
On that note Giant succeeds where many other films of this length fail.  In part because the lead roles played by Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor are enormously rich and textured.  They give so many layers to the characters by the end of the film the audience really feels like it has been on an intimate journey with them. This is the success of Giant.  If the characters did not grow and evolve then the picture would be difficult to sit through.  Hudson in particular is fantastic as he struggles with his old fassioned ideals in the face of an ever changing society.
Another actor who is just facinating to watch in this film is James Dean.  For the masses out there that know Dean as just a pretty face, you must know that he was an actor of limitless potential.  Dean must have been about 23 or 24 when he did this film and he died shortly after it's completion.  However, his character, Jett Rink, also evolves on a large scale throughout the picture.  And more so than Hudson Dean's Jett is always at odds with himself in the film.  This was similar to the characters Dean played in his other two films, East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause, but not to be mistaken, this character is perhaps even more complex.  It is too bad he did not get the chance to make more films.  He was a great actor.
Giant was and is a very good film.  Personally I feel three and a half hours is way too long for a movie, but not this one.  The picture stays interesting throughout and that is no small task.  It did not seem like three hours at all which is a testiment to it's quality.  Additionally I think this picture has aged really well.  I did not find it campy or over dramatic.  Also a young Dennis Hopper plays Jordan Jr. in the latter stages of the film which I got a kick out of.

The soundtrack also is miles above any previous mixes of the film.  As for the film itself all I can say is that I love every minute of it.

Stevens' waterlogged pacing sometimes pays off with added dramatic charge, sometimes merely seems lumbering.  Hudson and Taylor were never better (she's actually a living, breathing PERSON, for a change), and Dean is riveting.  Nakedly emotional, he invests the smallest gesture with a poignancy that's profoundly moving.  The fun in this disc is the additional features:  Gig Young plowing manfully through a bunch of Warner TV promos (including one with a charming, elfin Dimitri Tiomkin); the usual making-of documentary, replete with current video interviews with every survivor of the film's production they could coax in front of a camera; and, most glorious of all, the DuMont Network broadcast of the film's premiere.  Emcees Chill Wills and Jayne Meadows (!!!) hustle a who's-who of yesteryear celebs past the TV cameras, most pausing just long enough to proclaim GIANT the towering achievement of cinematic history and plug their own current movie. Catch George Nader, Rock Hudson and Tab Hunter making with some very ordinary-looking beards.  And, as the NY opening's a benefit for muscular dystrophy, the odd real person stumbles in among the actors, various charity figures begowned and tuxed and tiaraed for the big night, looking like deer caught in oncoming headlights as they burble and chatter and shove crippled tykes in wheelchairs toward the cameras.

824155,3,6304239149,"When reviewing a movie as generous in length as this one, one is left wondering where to start.  First, lets get the negatives out of the way.  Only one I can think of and that is that it runs a bit long.  This makes the film drag a bit in the midsection, but for some that is what makes it so great.  A matter of opinion, mostly, whether this is too long or not.
The positives:  First, the acting is out standing.  Liz Taylor is always spectacular, and Rock Hudson works wonders with Bick Benedict, making him come to life as a full real life, well rounded character.  James Dean is also in fine form here as Jett Rink.  Other notables include Mercedes McCambridge as Luz Benidict, and the actor who plays the son of the stars (I've forgotten the man's name).
There are also some incredible scenes here.  Virtually any scene with Dean is great and a double treat if Hudson and Dean are together.  The Christmas scenes are well done as is the return from the war which will bring tears to your eyes.  The scenes revolving around the dedication of the airport are all tremendous, as we see proof that one may grow older with out changing and the ingrained prejiduces that become standard after a lifetime.  The scene when Jett Rink's luck turns is one of the best in the whole movie as is his insuing confrontation with Benedict.  The scene in the cafe towards the end is also great.
In closing, the score is also amazing, with the swelling orchestra and the recurring theme that crops up from time to time.  In short, this movie is recommended.  You might have to break it up instead of sitting straight through it but it is definately worth a watch.",982800000,,1650,4.417218543046357

The three main stars offer their finest performance, in my opinion. Right down to the smallest part - every actor is impeccable in their depiction - just look at the expression on the Negro Manservant in Maryland - one can read his mind while watching his glances. The tiniest role players are gems in Giant. Viewers must concentrate carefully on every single scene so as not to miss a single detail. As it is over three hours long, an intermission might be preferred, rather than missing any moments as all are crucial. The version I have was recorded off television during a showing in the 1980's and I have now worn it out - so am thankfully able to obtain a new one through Amazon.  I have seen this Movie many times but it always has an incredible impact. Never was Elizabeth Taylor more breath-takingly beautiful or Rock Hudson more tall, dark & handsome !! James Dean's chiseled features and mumbling speech and every movement he makes totally portray the resentful rebel to the hilt. I found the sage of their disappointment with their children's choices in life interesting. Those who also find this should not miss another movie where this occurs - that is ""Splendour in the Grass"" starring Natalie Wood and introducing Warren Beatty. It has this similar theme but with much more tragic results as the parents force their children into ultimately ruining their lives. I think that four stars from Giant are also in Rebel Without A Cause. Dean, Hopper, Mineo and the other I think is the lady who plays young Jordan's wife. Is she Pilar del Rey ??? Anyway, this movie should not be missed. One can smell the greenness of the Maryland pasture and then taste the dust of Texas.

Giant continues to be a vivacious spirited romp of sheer narrative bliss as we are introduced to bigheaded Jordan ""Bic"" Benedict (Rock Hudson) as he earnestly courts and eventually weds the forcefully strong-willed Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor). Once the young newlyweds settle at Bic's renowned cattle ranch Reatta where Bic and Leslie begin to live their lives together, we meet the unaccommodating and disrespectful Reatta farmhand Jett Rink (James Dean in his third and final role), and the character relations developed here plant the seeds that set this Texan tale of pride, class, masculinity, and bigotry ablaze and never faltering through its pleasing three and half hour run. Shimmering and sparkling with legendary performances from its leads, great supporting roles by an astonishingly distinguished cast including a young Dennis Hooper (Jordan ""Bic"" Benedict III), Jane Withers, Chill Wills, Carroll Baker, Mercedes McCambridge, Sal Mineo, Rod Taylor, and Earl Holliman, staggering attention to every minute detail, and an exceptional notable awareness of the role of time on the trials and tribulations that the ""supposed"" advance of technology and culture have on the old-fashioned reminants of Texan Aristocracy, Giant remains an unforgettably momentous milestone in film history.

Every  subtle nuance, every hand gesture and movement of his body is  mesmerizing.
He completely outclasses Rock Hudson, who gives an adequate  performance, nothing more. Their scenes together almost make you wince at  Hudson's ineptitude in juxtaposition to Dean's understated mastery in the  acting department. The highlight of the film is when Jett finally strikes  oil and drives up to his rival Hudson and tells him the news (then punches  his lights out!)

824287,5,6304239149,"The screen adaptation of Edna Ferber's bestselling novel is big in every way.  Big screen, big stars, big budget, big name director.  Yet in spite  of all this ""bigness,"" Giant is a very personal, intimate story about a new  generation of Texans coming of age during a time of social and economic  change.  Elizabeth Taylor plays a privileged eastern woman (incorrectly  identified as a Southern belle by Amazon's reviewer) who falls in love with  Rock Hudson, a Texas cattle baron, when he visits her father's home in  order to purchase a much-prized horse.  Instead of bringing back just a  horse, Bick Benedict (Hudson) brings back Leslie (Taylor) as his bride.  Leslie's eastern upbringing is challenged by the more conservative Texas  culture she's been thrown into.  Far from a feminist crusader, Leslie  believes her opinions and thoughts are at least as important as her male  friends and neighbors, something unheard of in the relatively isolated  Texas ranch where Bick's family has made its home for generations.  Added  to this mix is Jet Rink (James Dean), a wrangler turned oil baron in an  ironic twist of fate.  Still hated and looked down upon by Bick and his  friends, they can't ignore his success, nor can they ignore the oil  business and its ever-growing importance to the surrounding Texas economy.  Filled with all the grandeur that you'd expect from a movie epic, Giant has  so much more.  Rich characterizations by Hudson, Taylor, and Dean, all  giving the performances of their careers.  Hudson proved his dramatic worth  with his portrayal of Bick Benedict.  His may be the best performance in  the film, which has unfortunately been overshadowed by Dean's untimely  death and ensuing mythology after Giant's production.  It's been recorded  that director George Stevens originally wanted Grace Kelly for the role of  Leslie and he was not happy with Taylor as second choice.  Well, if that's  the case, it doesn't show at all.  Stevens gets a marvelously nuanced  performance out of Taylor that is truly amazing to behold.  It's even more  amazing when you realize she was only 23 when the film was made (Dean was  the same age).  Just about everyone who was alive in the 1950s seems to be  in this movie and to great end.  The casting is absolutely perfect.  This  film is a career high point for all involved, including director Stevens,  who won the Oscar that year as best director (Amazingly the film lost out  to Mike Todd's Around the World in 80 Days for Best Picture).  Chill Wills  and Mercedes McCambridge are outstanding in their supporting roles, and  it's just plain  fun to see Dennis Hopper, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Rodney  Taylor (later changed to Rod), and Caroll Baker (who makes her big screen  debut in this film) at the beginnings of their careers.  The wonderful  score by Dimitri Tiomkin rounds out this excellent production.  It you love  big movies with big themes and great acting, Giant won't disappoint you.  After more than 40 years, it holds up amazingly well.  Great entertainment!",966384000,,3044,4.920634920634921
824288,5,6304239149,"""Giant"" This film is a masterpiece. I have always been an admirer of James  Dean. This film let's us see him come full circle from a youthful rascally  critter to an old man stubborn to the end clutching to some unrealized and  unshared dream of acceptance by his fellow man. As Jett Rink, Dean knew  exactly his own feelings in regard to the social economic classes that  society had conveniently categorized individuals, especially those germane  to Texas. He feels no guilt toward his own prejudices and only strives to  be accepted by the upper class (his fellow man) from which he literally  rose up to from the ground and enters into its ranks. Rock Hudson's Bick  Benedict, from his perspective, was born into the upper class and sees  himself as a great benefactor to the lower classes that are employed by  him. Unlike Dean's character, he is unaware of his own prejudices. The  Elizabeth Taylor character, Leslie Benedict, stands away from the canvas  and represents the unprejudiced point of view of the unflawed human spirit.  She stands as a mirror to reflect back the personifications that both Dean  and Hudson exhibit. She is direct and to the point with Hudson, her husband  in the film. He is just too blinded by his own upbringing to even make some  sense of what she is trying to point out in his flawed but self-noble  character. With Dean she is subtle in her assessment of his human  qualities, just as subtle as he is in the revelation of his prejudices.  Hudson does finally confront his flawed character very nobly and very  unaware of his own motivations. Dean does come full circle and ends up  where he started - still a scoundrel, but old and used up. I think that the  Hudson and Dean characters were a reflection of Texas society from both  ends of the spectrum set in the mid-twentieth century. As noble as the  Hudson character was in his attempt at redemption, Texas was not ready for  change at that time in History, but the seeds were planted (also  represented by Hudson and Taylor's offspring in the film) and it was just a  matter of time. I was born and raised in New England, but visited Texas  many times where half of my family resides. I have seen Texas first hand  from the early 60's to the present. This film has a special meaning for me.  The characters and the performances ring true. George Stevens' attention to  detail is seen and heard in every frame of this film. The performances of  its three stars are flawless, as are those of its many supporting players.  The Dimitri Tiomkin score is a great asset to the feel of this film. He  thematically represents the characters and their backgrounds to  dramatically drive the narrative. One scene that made you want to stand up  and cheer was the fight in the roadside diner. This scene was just as  moving and exciting as the bar room brawl in George Stevens' ""Shane"" and it  has his directorial fingerprint all over it. I highly recommend that people  get a chance to see this film and place themselves in the not too distant  past and view it from the perspective of when its characters lived and  thrived. This VHS widescreen version is excellent within the constraints of  the format. I was very pleased with it and it is the best version that  Warner Brothers has put on VHS in my opinion. I was also very much pleased  with the supplemental material included.",965865600,,3367,4.613175675675675
824289,5,6304239149,"This is the film which underlines the tragedy which is the early death of James Dean. His performance as an uneducated, insecure drunken ranch hand who strikes oil lingers in the memory - out of all proportion to the few  lines he gets in the script. It left me with the indelible impression of  another Orson Welles (in Citizen Kane, a similar portrayal of an old man by  a young actor) cut off before his time.
The long, rambling story is  reminiscent of the Texas landscape in which it is set. It goes on and on,  mostly featureless in terms of plot, but somehow keeps our attention  through great writing and performances.
A great allegory for the  transformation of America through the twentieth century; and a fine epitaph  for a superlative talent.",957744000,,755,4.666666666666667
824290,5,6304239149,"I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and think that it is great. It is the story of two generations of a Texas family and the changing times. My favorite charactor was Jett(James Dean) who tried to win over  Elizabeth Taylor by improving himself. He is looked down on by the Benedict  family and grows bitter. When he strikes it rich he still dosen't get his  girl and become a sleazy business man. He ultimatly fails due to a drinking  problem. Mr. Benedict changes over the movie from a strong headed rancher  to a soft hearted grandpa, and Taylor plays the woman who changes him. My  favorite line in this movie is when a drunk Jett encounters Mr. Benedict  after striking oil. ""I'm gonna be richer then all you sons of  Benedicts ever dreamed you could be."" In this line he shows the  bitterness that would lead to his fall.",949363200,,837,4.453947368421052

James Dean, Elizabeth Taylor, and Rock Hudson are outstanding.  Growing up in Marfa and seeing  where these talented actors stayed and worked is amazing.  This is a  definite movie for all to see whether you are a fan of westerns or not.  Giant is one of the top movies of the 1900's.",946857600,,409,4.373333333333333

The movie is full of great performances by Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and especially James Dean, in full mumbliness. Plus, Mercedes McCambridge, who received an Oscar nomination for this role. However, the Blu-Ray transfer was terrible, which is why Im giving it a 4, instead of a 5. There are ghost halos and much below average sharpness. Its a shame they didn't pay more attention to such a great film.",1519257600,,487,4.674418604651163
