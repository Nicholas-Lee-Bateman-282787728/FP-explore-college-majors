The story may not be ""actual fact"" but it is based off a true story.  I love this movie and was glad my daughter insisted we buy it.",1247184000,3,267,4.196078431372549
8338126,3,B001RJXG9U,"Decent for what it is,kind of a neat little supernatural horror flick,typical elements such as a group of younger people in a situation that likely won't end well for them,plus it has Rowdy,Rody Piper in it ,if thats a selling point to anyone",1446076800,,242,4.651162790697675

8338128,1,B001RJXG9U,"Watched it for free on netflix, it's not scary, very disappointing. Bad acting and the plot could've been better and more frightening. The last 20 minutes of the movie are filled with nonesence gore. Overall it's boring and frights are few if any",1365724800,,246,4.744186046511628
8338129,1,B001RJXG9U,"Ghosts of Goldfield is a disaster the entire way through.  A really low budget type of horror that does nothing at all in ANY category (no horror whatsoever, no interesting concept, no quality acting, *nothing* at all).  I think what hurts it the most is that it tries to implement a ghost character that the teenagers can SEE but... it looks so much like a regular woman instead of a ghost that it's VERY hard to take seriously, haha.

The one scene in particular that strikes me as really awful is when the teens first spot the ghost and they follow her down the stairs of a hotel room.  Honestly, the only good thing about this spot is the unintentional parts- that being, the camera view that shows the ghost from the front side which means we see the flashlight reflection on the walls that the teens were using to follow the ""ghost"".  Unintentionally unique lighting that initially made me think that something supernatural was responsible for the lighting.  They kind of ruined the scene by continuing to show us more of the teens following the ghost.

The overexaggeration from the one guy working at the hotel is laughable.  He's REALLY mean towards the kids, and there's no clear reason why he'd act in such a manner other than the movie writers were playing on the old cliched horror trick that ""There must be a scary mean guy to frighten the teens"", haha.  Reminded me of Scooby Doo!

The storyline is totally disgusting.  Instead of focusing on actual hauntings and ghosts, it mainly takes us on a sinking ship (not literally unfortunately, I mean metaphorically) of nothing but ""relationship"" scenes between the teens.  You have one of the teens (the brunette girl) that likes to be naughty and steal things, and her presence is basically what ruins the entire story because all she does is either secretly roam around the hallways and steal the things that she likes, or, cheats on the other girls boyfriend.  I actually didn't even realize initially that the blonde girls boyfriend was that one guy until the brunette starting jumping on his lap in one segment later on (you know what I mean by this!)  Unbearable!

The only segment that did sort of frighten me through all the horrible acting and storytelling is when the one male teen got pushed down the stairs, and the camera view showed the old lady ghost from the fallen teens point of view (that being the bottom of the stairs where you could anticipate her face moving across the top step) and then suddenly the old lady was just THERE at the bottom of the stairs to finish the teen off using her hands.  That was honestly the best moment in the entire movie.  The way some of the other teens die is just... ugh!  Really really average.

Just a really embarrassingly bad attempt at horror.  Nothing went right.  All the characters mannerisms weren't believable, and there's so many problems that it's best to just award it the 1-star rating it deserves and not even give it a second thought.",1332892800,2,2965,4.652591170825336
8338130,1,B001RJXG9U,"Featuring perhaps the most awkward and stilted dialogue ever, what The Ghosts of Goldfield lacked in writing, it did not make up in acting or special effects.  We did get a few laughs out of it; unintentional ones I'm sure, but not enough to recommend it for its camp value.  Really, there's nothing to recommend this poor excuse of a movie at all.  Except for the Kool-aid blood.",1326326400,2,380,4.5588235294117645
8338131,2,B001RJXG9U,"Movie review of ""The Ghosts of Goldfield"" : This movie was suppose to be based upon the actual haunted hotel in Goldfield, Nevada,but,in fact, the movie was shot inside Tonopah's Mizpah Hotel; there were a few scenes in which you could see a fancy ""M"" etched upon the glass in the doors. It also got the story wrong as the prostitute who was chained up in room 109 gave birth to her child while a prisoner, NOT after giving birth as the movie portrayed. This movie had sooo much potential, but ended up as nothing more than a cheesy gore fest towards the end. Too bad as the story of the Goldfield Hotel is actually very interesting and needs to be told...properly! What'smore, the producers of this movie dropped the golden egg as the Mizpah Hotel actually has its own ghost story in regards to The Lady In Red who haunts the place mostly upon the 6th floor. While The Goldfield Hotel is closed to the public, Tonopah's Mizpah Hotel is being restored to its former beauty and shall be opening its doors once more in the very near future; I had the honor of entering it just a few days back and was greatly impressed by the restoration being done. Check her out when you have the opportunity.",1319500800,4,1192,4.447488584474886
8338132,4,B001RJXG9U,"This is quite a good low budget horror, just goes to show with a bunch of talented young actors you don't need much to make an enjoyable movie. The ghosts could have been a bit creepier but the students/film makers were fun to watch as they got picked off. Definately recommend this one to everyone",1286323200,,298,4.4363636363636365
8338133,3,B001RJXG9U,"Familiar scenario:  a group of friends investigate a supposedly haunted hotel and wind up dead.  Here's some other tidbits:
1.  TWILIGHT's Kellan Lutz shows he's not going to establish himself outside the TWILIGHT franchise.
2.  Wrestler Roddy Piper gives more believable performances in the ring.
3.  Blood doesn't spurt like cranberry juice.
4.  There's nothing fresh or scary in this ghost story.
AVOID.",1270512000,3,406,5.365079365079365
8338134,3,B001RJXG9U,"Ghosts of Goldfield is not a bad little movie to watch. I was disappointed that Roddy Piper was kinda flat. He was good in They Live and the rest of the cast was ok. Would I buy it? No. There are 2 gruesome deaths but thats it. It could of been a total waste,but its watchable. The story is simple a group of film makers record ghosts in an abandoned Hotel. There is only one ghost perhaps it would of been better if there was more.",1252886400,3,432,4.034883720930233
8338135,1,B001RJXG9U,"I didn't like this movie at all. It was kind of boring, really just terrible and totally forgetable. I wouldn't even want to watch it on tv for free. A total waste of time.",1250726400,5,172,4.088235294117647
