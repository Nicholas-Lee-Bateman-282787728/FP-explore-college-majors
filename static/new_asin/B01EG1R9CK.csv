7734826,5,B01EG1R9CK,Good movie about some French Foreign Legionnaires' experiences during the Algerian war for independence from France back in the 1950s and 1960s.,1470787200,,144,5.590909090909091
7734827,1,B01EG1R9CK,Not very accurate and don favour the Legionnaires.,1469923200,,50,5.375
7734828,5,B01EG1R9CK,"Good take on the Algerian fight for independence circa 1960. Realistically portrayed, solid acting from multiple perspectives recommended for anyone interested in the politics and emotional turmoil of colonial North Africa. A definite recommendation for students in my class studying terrorism who have first developed the background to better appreciate the film. I bounced this four to four and one-half star flick (IMO) up to 5-stars to generate more interest in the film for those who will understand it. I found the film actually got better when watching it a second and third time. Don't expect the typical Hollywood-style action flick and brush up on your French and you might like it as well. Of course you can also read the English subtitles and let the language barrier fade into the background after the first 15 to 20 minutes.

If you 'get it,' you may start to understand much of the basis of the current conflicts and terrorist activity in North Africa and the Middle East. If you don't 'get it,' well, sorry, but there's no quick way to provide the necessary background for understanding the film or the current rise in terrorist activity worldwide.",1469664000,2,1164,4.969230769230769
7734829,2,B01EG1R9CK,"Based on the excellent book ""Legionnaire"" by Englishman Simon Murray, this is a so-so adaptation of story. This low budget movie would've been helped by having a cast of more than 2 dozen.",1469318400,,188,4.7272727272727275
7734830,4,B01EG1R9CK,"A well made, no frills film. Not beau geste, but down to earth, and he gets the girl in the end. ""Vive la Legion!""",1469318400,,114,3.7916666666666665
7734831,3,B01EG1R9CK,"Decent show,  gives a good retelling of what was happening to the French Empire after WW2",1469232000,,89,4.5625
7734832,3,B01EG1R9CK,"A film that shows multiple points of view (soldiers, civilians, partisans) from those caught in war. Somehow the sadistic training instills toughness in the recruits. Many with military experience have ""been there, done that""  (to a much lesser degree) so it might work even if this film didn't show much in the way of letting these guys grow into competence.  The problem with the film - even if Murray provides interesting insights and relationships- are the couple of casual horror incidents by Legionnaires, whose actions are not even required as part of the brutality of war. Even with these super-tough guys, the officer's would have to realize their controlled beast was off its leash, if they pulled the soup stunt and the troops just laughed. But for the few scenes, it was interesting to watch what these guys got themselves into. BTW: This movie was originally released in 2002 as ""Deserter.""",1467676800,,903,4.973509933774834

7734835,4,B01EG1R9CK,Good movie. Showed the brutality of the French in Algeria.  I was a relief to see a movie which was not totally Eurocentric.,1485475200,,124,4.391304347826087

7734840,1,B01EG1R9CK,Really a crummy movie. I find it hard to believe an adult could have written the dialogues that appear in this movie. They are so inane as to be totally unrealistic. Save your time and money.,1483056000,,191,4.333333333333333

7734848,2,B01EG1R9CK,I watched about 3/4 of it and it turned from a so-called action movie to an after-school special written by social justice warriors (and just plain boring),1480464000,,155,4.777777777777778

7734850,4,B01EG1R9CK,great to see films about the legion. The story line was a little weak and the NCOs were portrayed as being sadistic. Some back story about Algeria would have been helpful to those who are unfamiliar with the political situation.,1479168000,,228,4.725

7734856,2,B01EG1R9CK,"This movie is not "" Four Feathers"" quality nor as good as some older films depicting men in the French Foreign Legion. It seems to be more of a short story extended with scenes of harsh training endured by the recruits.
Fairly weak story line and not a lot of background changes. The cast was decent is about all I can say about that.",1477612800,4,334,4.234375

Tom Hardy is a key but ancillary character.  A Frenchman who joins the French Foreign Legion with two buddies from Spain.

It's 1960 so they are sent to Algeria for their mandatory minimum service of 5 years to fight France's ill fated attempt to keep its colony in Algeria.  They ostensibly fight the Algerian resistance, but they also fight the French colonists who don't want to leave Algeria as well as the regular French army under DeGsulle which wants to cut its losses, declare victory, and go home to France

The film centers on an English volunteer who wrote the book upon which the movie is based.

Their indoctrination/boot camp is hell, but this group of unlikely misfits bonds into a unit.  It quickly becomes obvious to the Brit that the French do not belong in Algeria after he tries to befriend Algerians and French colonists, the Pied noir or black feet",1503705600,,986,4.664739884393064
8758565,3,B01EG1R9CK,Decent movie about the French trying to hold on to their colony.,1497657600,,64,4.416666666666667
8758566,5,B01EG1R9CK,This is a serious movie which was made to score some serious points. It seems to me that many of the negative reviewers did not watch the movie through to the end. Or else they did not watch it at all.,1495238400,2,201,3.926829268292683
8758567,4,B01EG1R9CK,"Also called ""Deserter.""  2002 Movie.  Well done film about the French Foreign legion complete with a much more realistic look at life in the Legion versus the glamorized versions.  Brutal indoctrination, shallow friends bonded by adversity versus ideals.  Timed during the Algerian fight for independence and all of the turmoil it entails, even for the Legion.  In the end I was surprised by this reasonably accurate version of Legion life and a most interesting ending......The movie was well done!",1492646400,4,499,5.265822784810126
8758568,1,B01EG1R9CK,"An awful adaptation of Simon Murray's book ""Legionnaire"". I can't believe that Murray had anything to do with this tripe, it completely went the opposite direction of the book. Simon Murray exposed the brutal side of the Legion in the book but he was proud to have served in the Legion & left as an honored Legionnaire. The movie made it seem like he couldn't wait to get out & hated every second he was in the force. The movie also suffered from weak characters, poor script & so-so battle scenes. Do yourself a favor & pass on this one.",1486512000,,538,4.39
