2637480,5,B000HEZEU0,"This anime is awesome! I hate that it's only 13 episodes , it should have been longer! Anyways it's about a boy who's in a band and is at that point of success in music. He meets a man who is very cold to him and suddenly finds he's in love with Yuki. And now that he's famous, people are doing anything to find more out about him plus Yuki has a dark secret of his own. Anyway it's really funny and you might also shed some tears like I did.",1160438400,12,442,3.868131868131868

2637502,5,B000HEZEU0,"First of all, I'm not a huge anime fan, but I started watching this on Anime Network (cable channel) and I was hooked from the first episode and actually bought my first anime DVD. Yes, the two main characters are gay and Yuki has some hokey lines, but it's more than made up for in the humor and the character development. Warning, it can be a little slapsticky -- with the former CIA agent manager, a fey idol with a toy rabbit, the lovelorn fiance and Shuichi's goofy antics -- but the ending seemed to make it all worth it. I only wished there was a sequel.",1245628800,2,561,4.252336448598131

2637505,5,B000HEZEU0,"If you are hesitating or are on the fence about buying this series, DON'T WAIT ANOTHER MINUTE!  Gravitation is the Platinum standard of shounen-ai and is a fantastic anime series period.  While the manga is sensational and at times edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, the anime series is just as gripping, and the characters are rich, colorful, and beautiful.  Seeing everyone's favorite sullen novelist Eiri Yuki in full color animation is well worth the purchase, but that's just the icing on a sweet, sweet cake.

The songs are great of course, and the English voice cast is actually more than just tolerable -- they do a really good job.  The box itself makes for a beautiful display, and each of the 4 disc cases features a bold, colorful, sexy rendition of Shuichi and Eiri.  The extra features are fun and informative, especially the liner notes which detail certain specific details in some episodes that may be missed or confusing.

The few love/kissing scenes are extremely tame -- hence the shounen-ai label and not yaoi -- but sweet nonetheless.  There are mushy, ""awwwww""-inspiring moments for those that like that, funny moments, guns, laughs, cries, and everything in-between.  There's something for everyone.  Even my hard-core action anime-loving friends enjoy Gravitation.  There's just something about it that hooks you in and won't let go...

All in all, this is one of my favorite anime series of all times, and is one of the most beautiful dvd boxsets I've ever owned.  While you may be able to find it less expensive on another site, BUY IT.  You will NOT be disappointed.  After all, It's...Gravitation...",1199232000,32,1624,5.0299625468164795
2637506,5,B000HEZEU0,"I love it!  Totally awesome series, especially if you are a fan of music and shounen-ai.  Very strong story and entertainment galore!",1191888000,,133,5.0
2637507,5,B000HEZEU0,"OKay I admit it this is my first same sex anime, and what first got my attection was the music theme. But I can honestly say this is one of the best animes I have ever seen in my life. (I'm kinda sad I didn't discovered it sooner.) Now if you have any problems with same sex coupling simple, don't watch. But IMO when it comes down to it Gravitation is just a great powerful love story.
It's what I love about anime it's FUNNY and then you might find yourself sad and heartbroken for the charcthers. The three main guys are just down right eye candy. Shuichi is just so likeable with some of the cutest faces and Yuki is just breathtaking in looks. And you really feel for him, for both of them.
Then the music is some of if not the best japanese rock music I have ever heard! (You might want to get the soundtracks after hearing.) The English dub is one of the best ever! Bravo to the cast! Espically IMO Shuichi and Yuki's VA's.
Anyway I LOVED the series (I couldn't stop watching) and was sad when it ended. I'm so proud to call myself a fan and I feel this anime deserves more then 5 stars! ^_^",1184803200,,1098,4.135514018691588
2637508,4,B000HEZEU0,"Though the series is absolutely wonderful, the subtitles aren't. If you get the series, definitely get the English version, so that you won't have to deal with bad grammar, misused words, and confusion. English version is excellent!",1180396800,10,232,5.297297297297297
2637509,5,B000HEZEU0,"This is a fantastic set and has some fun extra features.  It has all the episodes and the language settings are easy to access.  However, the set doesn't include the OVAs.

8139598,4,B000HEZEU0,"Okay, so I had bought the first dvd of this show and found it funny and cute. So I thought why not find out more about Yuki's dark past. Lol. I love all kinds of anime's even guy on guy action sometimes as long as its not porn stuff. Now I have not finished it since I bought it because I have a bad habit of starting a anime then stoping in the middle an starting another one. But so far I do like the show and the art is different from the run of the mill art. Plus Yuki's eyes make me swoon!! :)

If you like funny, random, dark action then you will love this show.

Also the package came in good condition and the dvd's are in very good shape!! :)",1402963200,,651,3.8507462686567164

8139601,5,B000HEZEU0,This anime is an old one.  It's about a rock band coming of age and also there's a relationship between guys.  Lots of conflict.  I can say great overall.,1368230400,,154,4.241379310344827
8139602,5,B000HEZEU0,"As a yaoi fangirl, Gravitation and God Save Our King were the first series to get me into the genre (and realize how cliche and how many bad tropes there are in this genre...). Gravitation is one of the oldest examples of a shonen ai (not yaoi...well the manga is yaoi, but the anime is shonen ai) done right.

Shuichi Shindou has just gotten out of high school (in the manga at least as the anime starts out with them out of high school) and wants to start a band with his friend Hiro. When writing lyrics for a song one day, he ends up losing it and its almost blown away only for a mysterious blonde grabbing it and telling Shuichi that he has no talent. Shuichi is pissed at these words and vows to find the man who insulted him after that night. When he finds him, he gets more than what he bargained for and ends up in a dysfunctional relationship with the man known as Eiri Yuki.

From there though, Shuichi and Hiro do get their wish as they do start a band and pretty soon make it to the top of Japan (and its all about keeping the top spot in terms of music) but Shuichi has to balance music with his weird love life with Yuki.

I'll say this right now. The music in this series is GODLY! Gravitation and Full Moon O Sagashite have the best music in terms of music anime. Kinya Kotani takes over Shuichi's voice when he starts singing but his voice is good~ I think Shuichi's first song was The Rage Beat and the animation during the performance is amazing. What saddens me is how the anime can't put the entire soundtrack in the anime and you have to find it on a CD or on a website. However, I still have to admit that Ryuichi's song Sleepless Beauty surpasses anything that Shuichi can sing (and its admitted in series). The music theme is very important in the series as a whole.

The plot is one of the first shonen-ai/yaoi series with an actual plot that isn't just making love after an obvious cliche plot like introduce girl, get jealous and get back together. The major focus of the series is on the career aspect (and the only anime that does it like this is Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi) and then focuses on the personal life of the characters.

The characters are very unique during this time. Although Shuichi and Yuki's relationship is a huge double standard I admit. Basically, if Shuichi was a girl and allowed Yuki to continue to abuse her, Shuichi would be getting flack for being a love martyr that needs to leave the abusive relationship. If Yuki was a girl, he would be hated for being so mean and abusive to a nice guy like Shuichi and doesn't deserve a good man. Because they're both guys, its not pointed out in the fanbase (only a few people are disturbed by Yuki's abusive nature especially in the manga). Also what annoys me is how the manga treats Shuichi (the anime is way better at portraying Shuichi's personality.) I think what I hate about manga Shunichi is how he becomes a stereotype uke as time goes on and becomes more hyperactive and annoying then hot-blooded and determined he starts out as and because the anime ends before this shift takes place. As a result, we see Shuichi having a backbone...and I love how despite his cheerfulness, he has proven to be a yandere (hint: he admits that he would rather have Yuki die then leave him alone and would do the deed himself...before going back to his cheerful self). In fact, I'm surprised how many crazy people are in this series and because the series switched between comedy and drama. I mean, I'm still looking at the scene where Yuki's brother in law Tohma PUSHED SOMEONE INTO A MOVING CAR ATTEMPTING TO KILL HIM. Yes the guy deserved that but it's still shocking that he would go through with that at the risk of getting arrested. (And let's not go to that one scene where Tohma decided to attack someone with an axe...that's funny and scary at the same time at how ridiculously insane this guy is.) Then again, everyone is insane. Mr. K is the typical American that uses guns in order to have his way...and its played for laughs especially when he starts shooting people (he guarantee no one died during his rampage but...)

Regardless, I feel like the relationship between Shuichi and Yuki are portrayed somewhat realistically with Shuichi being able to show that he can change someone who is messed up in the head after some abuse and what not (I don't ship stockholm syndrome so...)

But even if you're not a yaoi fan, you can enjoy a shonen-ai series like Gravitation. It's very tame compared to other series and its funny and dramatic (lots of mood whiplash).",1363305600,2,4558,4.451497005988024
