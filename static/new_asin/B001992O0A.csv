3428610,5,B001992O0A,"Tuesday Nights, 7:00 PM following Wheel of Fortune. At that time, I was glued to the TV and trust me when I say you wouldn't have been able to get me away from it!

I've loved ""Rescue 9-1-1"" for as long as I can remember! Personally, I'd call it true Reality Tv, not this extremely over-rated trash we have on Tv today. Seriously, can shows like ""Jersey Shore"" teach you something as valuable as what to do in an emergency? But, I'm getting off track here.

As stated by several other customers, ""Rescue 9-1-1"" was a reality-based Tv Series, narated and hosted by the legendary William Shatner. The show ran on Cbs for 7 Seasons (from 1989 to 1996,) and profiled the true stories of people (or sometimes animals) in danger, as well as the 9-1-1 dispatchers, police officers, firefighters, paramedics and/or bystanders who (in most stories,) saved the lives of said victims. There were several stories that ended in at least one death, but these were usually documentary-style stories, or stories that involved multiple victims.

What really gets me is that Arnold Shapiro, (the executive producer of the show,) seems to have forgotten how educational it was. Otherwise, I'm sure it would've long-since been out! More than 300 lives have been saved simply because of what various viewers of ""Rescue 9-1-1"" learned from watching it! Examples: Two children witnessed their grandmother choking on a piece of fried chicken, and were able to get it out by doing the Heimlich Maneuver, saving her life. How'd they know how to do it? ""Rescue 9-1-1""!
A man witnessed a motor vehicle accident, and noticed that the driver of the truck involved was pinned beneath it. He lifted the truck off her, and then noticed she wasn't breathing. So, he gave her mouth-to-mouth, saving her life. Where did he learn mouth-to-mouth? ""Rescue 9-1-1""!
Two young children woke up to discover that their bedroom was on fire. They ran out, shut the door to their room, entered their parents room, woke them up and they all got out safely. The dad himself said, ""He showed me through that fire!"" Where did these two young children learn what to do if something like this ever happens? ""Rescue 9-1-1""!
There are several other examples I could give, but I think you get the idea.

It's just mind-boggling that so many shows of today, (quite a few of them not that great,) are even being aired on TV let alone out on Dvd, yet ""Rescue 9-1-1,"" a great, educational, life-saving show hasn't graced the shelves of our local retale stores, or the pages of online-shopping websites like amazon.com yet! Shatner himself said it best at the beginning of one episode.
""A Television Program's success can be measured in many different ways: Ratings, awards, reviews... For us, the most important measure has been in lives.""

The fact that ""Rescue 9-1-1"" saved well over 300 lives, (possibly even thousands,) should be enough for Arnold Shapiro Productions and 20th Century Fox to release it on Dvd! I promise you, it'll both make money and (more importantly,) continue to save lives!

As a side note, I think it'd be nice to get Shatner involved in trying to get ""Rescue 9-1-1"" out on Dvd, as well as the individuals who were featured in stories on the show! Who's with me?",1287964800,8,3229,4.777777777777778
3428611,5,B001992O0A,These true stories were outstanding reality TV before the network execs discovered the formula for faux-drama mixing beautiful bodies with trite but elaborately staged crises like Amazing Race and Survivor. It's time to bring it back on DVD so a new generation can enjoy these tales of heroism and grace under pressure.,1272672000,7,319,5.153846153846154
3428612,5,B001992O0A,"When this series began I had just become an EMT. It was an exciting time for me, sleeping at the ambulance garage every Friday night, waiting for the calls, hoping I'd know the right thing to do. I had a trainer, along with the other EMTs who responded to calls, who taught me more and more each week. Watching Rescue 911 raised my awareness of what emergency medicine can do to help people in need, the value of this wonderful profession. During the first season I watched, learned and enjoyed. But the best was the first show of the second season which dealt entirely with stories of people whose lives had been saved because of knowing what to do in an emergency from watching the show! I wondered whether the makers of the show had ever imagined the life-saving effect they would have on the viewing public. From then on, every first show of the new season had such stories. Rescue 911 is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. It was real life stories with real life details - better than the soap-opera-like medical shows we see so much of now. A dvd of all the seasons would be a great thing to own.",1263600000,17,1108,4.357487922705314
3428613,5,B001992O0A,"I love this series. I remember when I was a kid and me and my mom would sit and watch this together, I loved it and it really taught me as a child why I shouldnt, cook by myself, play with fire, matches, knifes, guns, fire works, or animals. Rescue 911 was not only a great show but a good learning tool for children. It gave my parents a visual aid for accidents rather than them just telling me, ""you cant do that because I said so"". Because I would have probably done it anyway thinking nothing would go wrong.
This should be aired on tv again from beginning to end and ""DVD Please""
I hope someone will read these requests and take them into consideration because trust me whoever decides to release this series will definately make some money.",1259107200,16,747,4.3428571428571425
3428614,5,B001992O0A,"This is my favorite television series ever. For those of you who don't remember, this is the TV series hosted by William Shattner 15 years later after the original STAR TREK TV SERIES but before BOSTON LEGAL. Rescue 911 aired from 1989-1996 for 7 seasons and 958 episodes. Sindicated re-runs aired on THE FAMILY CHANNEL AND ODYSEEY until 2005. Need not to worry anymore... you can watch ALL 958 episodes on YOUTUBE. Go to [...] 911. All
of the stories ARE REAL. Some of them have been reconstructed with actors playing the roles of the victums. All of the 911 phone calls are REAL the dispaters are NOT actors. The police, firemen and parametics are NOT actors. The show is a real blast and deserves to be realeased on DVD. I am hoping REAL SOON............",1248739200,11,757,4.614814814814815
3428615,5,B001992O0A,"I have been a fan of Rescue 911 for at least ten years. It was always the highlight of my week when, at eight o'clock on Tuesday evenings I would sit down in front of the TV to watch 911. Of course I was delighted when I discovered that the Family Channel was also airing the show, not just every day, but at one point two episodes per day. Of course I was rarely able to watch the one at noon being in school, but I would always catch the nine o'clock one. Which meant two episodes of 911 on Tuesday, first the one on CBS at eight, then the nine o'clock one on the Family Channel, and three per day sometimes on those rare occasions when I was at home at noon.
  For those who don't know, Rescue 911 was a reality TV show hosted by William Shatner that retold true stories of people rescued from emergency situations. Many were reenactments of past emergencies, but some were actually filmed on the scene of events as they happened, usually hospitals in which several different events occurred simultaneously.
  The show first aired in 1989 and ran until 1996, after which it was aired in sindication for a time. Unfortunately, to my knowledge it's not being aired on any network in the US anymore, which is why I really hope they do actually decide to release the series on DVD.
  One of the things I really liked about Rescue 911 was that the stories it told nearly always ended happily, though there were exceptions when one or more of the victims didn't survive. I was amazed that some of the people on the show survived, let alone made such complete recoveries from their ordeals. There were also occasionally some more lighthearted incidents, such as the burglar who attempted to break into a house posing as Santa Claus only to get stuck hanging head down in the chimney, or the woman who came home to discover what she thought was a burglar standing in her front entry and called the police only to discover that it was a maniquin. Another favorite was the burglar who broke into a store only to become trapped inside and had to call 911 in order to get out.
  One of the other things I always found most memorable about the show was its theme music. At first it actually scared me a little bit but I got used to it after a while and then I couldn't get enough of it, from the opening theme with its sound and video clips to its closing theme with the memorable ending of ""Mr. Shapiro, step out of the car please,"" just as the music draws to its close.
  So again I really do hope they actually do decide to release Rescue 911 on DVD, or that they start airing it in sindication on US TV again. I've really missed that show!",1227398400,33,2633,4.333333333333333

8272918,5,B001992O0A,"I haven't really seen this show a very long time on TV. I remember watching it on the Family channel which is now ABC Family, and then on to CBS. I remember the part where a daughter and a father go on some picnic and when they were on the road. They were driving in some red two-door car, and then a dump truck fell on them! And all the sand covered the car. The next one I remembered is when the litte girl ask her mom if she could bathe her little brother and her mom said no but she did it anyway. The little girl said she was testing to see if the water was hot or cold. She felt the cold water and decided to turn it all the way to hot! Then her little brother said it was too hot and his skin started to melt. Her mother came in the bathroom and just completely freak out. And the next thing I remember is when those kids where in the basement with their father. Their father was looking at this heater and then light up a match, and then it just EXPLODES. The two children were badly burn that they had no hair and had to wear like protection on their bodies. I'm telling you. This is one scary show!",1402790400,,1108,3.950892857142857
8272919,5,B001992O0A,I learned a lot of facts and safety tips from this show.  I was 6 years old when my family started watching it.  I still remember many episodes in vivid detail.  What a great series!,1400889600,2,182,4.142857142857143
8272920,5,B001992O0A,"It has been so long since Rescue 9-1-1 aired I had forgotten how many seasons it had run. A darned shame it has not even been released on VHS and wonder if there is a reason. Certainly there is a market for it but if there is a valid reason why it has not been released, we viewers are not generally aware of it. That being said, My roommate and I really looked forward to watching two shows - America's Most Wanted and Rescue 9-1-1. I also enjoyed the show that either came before or after AMW, Cops, but that was too realistic for her. We were amazed at the variety of types of rescues we watched each week but it really has been too long for me to remember a single rescue. We were aware actors portrayed for the most part the ones involved and looked forward to seeing the real people at the ends of the episodes. I agree that many lives have been saved from techniques learned while watching the show and if it never gets released, at least it has that legacy. I do not remember the source, but I did read somewhere that eventually everything will be released on DVD so it could just be a long wait with a happy ending. My fingers are crossed, and my toes as well.",1376265600,3,1169,4.176991150442478
8272921,5,B001992O0A,"My sister and I used to LOVE this show as a kid. We would each put a can of Faygo pop in the fridge like a week before the show started so it would be good and cold while we would watch the show and sip on our Grape Faygo pop. I would even put a note on mine in the fridge saying ""DON'T DRINK..Saving for 911"". If someone drank mine before the show boy watch out. Gosh I hope they bring this to DVD. This is a great show and has saved a lot of peoples lives.",1355270400,5,458,3.683673469387755
