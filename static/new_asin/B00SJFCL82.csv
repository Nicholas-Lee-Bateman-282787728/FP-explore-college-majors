6989414,3,B00SJFCL82,"I am fascinated by the study of dinosaurs and own a lot of videos on the subject.  But, none (other than ""Walking With Dinosaurs"") can""hold a candle"" to this one.  It is, easily, the most comprehensive and enjoyable video on dinosaurs that I have ever watched. And, there is a lot of new information in here not in any other.  It even debunks some long-held beliefs about dinosaurs.  This is a ""must see"" documentary for anyone interested in this subject!  However, BEWARE!!!!!  I originally bought this documentary in just a 2D presentation.  It was 174 minutes long - all of it very enjoyable.  Then, ""Planet Dinosaur"" came out in 3D and I decided that I just had to have it. So, without doing much investigation, I ordered it.  WOW!  What a huge mistake!  The 3D version is only 53 minutes long!!!  (and not the best 53 minutes, in my opinion).  So, I would give the original version of this 5 stars (or more if one could), but, due to its hugely disappointing length, I would give the 3D version 1 star!",1433980800,3,1007,4.497237569060774
6989415,5,B00SJFCL82,"I really enjoyed this ""movie"" - even though it was less than an hour long.  It was very interesting and keeps your attention - went through the different dinosaurs species, when they existed, how they evolved, statistics, and had some excellent animation and imagined real-life scenarios.  There were some VERY good 3D pop-outs and the animation was excellent.  I've shared this with a couple of people and it's been very well received. Glad I bought it.  Well worth the $$$$",1431388800,3,475,4.9

6989417,5,B00SJFCL82,"PLANET DINOSAUR is a great, entertaining way to learn about dinosaurs. The narrator talks about various dinosaurs, including the gigantic Spinosaurus  larger than Tyrannosaurus Rex  as maps and graphics pinpoint where the bones of each dinosaur were found. The narrator also explains how scientists determined how they hunted, what their prey was, and how they died. It wasn't always larger dinosaurs that did them in. Weather had a lot to do with the deaths of many.

But by far the best aspect of this amazing release is the computer-generated interpretations of what these beasts looked like when they roamed the earth millions of years ago. Rendered with painstaking artistic skill, the dinosaurs are shown in circumstances they well may have encountered, such as defending killed prey, eluding a predator, using specific skills to find food, and surviving in an often hostile environment. The artists have been careful to show how the dinosaurs moved, some lumbering, others surprisingly spry.

3D brings the images to life. Filmed in high definition Blu-ray 3D, the film makes it more fun to witness these gigantic creatures do their thing. Though the scientific explanations may be above the heads of youngsters, they will love seeing these big beasts in action. The images are so convincing, the film is almost like a true-life nature documentary. At under an hour, the film packs in lots of information and some memorable images. Its a great way to learn about these dramatic creatures.",1428451200,5,1495,5.139917695473251
6989418,5,B00SJFCL82,"If you were a big fan of the six-part BBC documentary, Planet Dinosaur, thats fine.  Frankly, nothing is quite as good as 3D dinosaur teeth threatening to bite your head off in your own living room.  Educational of course because I did learn some cool, awe-inspiring facts about dinosaurs.  There are a lot of new discoveries happening all the time and finding out about them will thrill and amaze even the most ardent dino fan.

Be prepared to back up as these colossal critters stomp around on the scene.  I got a total sense of how they move, run, and search for their prey from the computer-generated images.  Of course John Hurts narration makes it sound more like a documentary than a Jurassic Park-like adventure, but its all in what you make of it.  I could almost smell the dinos and imagine them stomping and moving the ground.

You can watch individual episodes from the documentary (listed below), but Planet Dinosaur 3D can be watched time and time again, which is something I like to do.  I enjoy learning about dinos and loved watching them in action.  If you have youngsters in the house who are ardent dino fans, this film is a must have.  The film can also be played in 2D, but not on any DVD player.

8698588,5,B00SJFCL82,"A strong addition to a 3D or dinosaur collection.  Extremely well researched and presented.  The overlapping maps of the evolving world are fascinating.  A menu of little known, recently discovered dinosaurs are featured and the newest theories and evidence.",1437868800,2,258,5.564102564102564
8698589,1,B00SJFCL82,"Warning: This is NOT the full 6-part BBC documentary. For reasons that utterly baffle me, for the region A release they took the 6 half-hour episodes and edited them down to a single hour-long feature. Why? Why not just release the 6 episodes? Why pay someone to edit out 2/3 of your content when you could just release the series as is? I know the series was broadcast in 3D, so it's not a matter of converting it to a new format. It defies all sense. Do not make my mistake. Do not buy this travesty.",1437609600,11,502,4.239583333333333

8698592,2,B00SJFCL82,"While the feature starts out with strong 3D and an interesting premise, it quickly dilutes into a child's documentary.  Far too many ""pauses"" for fact checking, which tends to slow down the feature and detracts from what could have been an interesting feature. A recommended rental.",1436227200,,282,5.130434782608695
