7859991,1,6304040210,This movie plays about 30 seconds and then cuts off. I tried it several times and the same thing happened. I rated it one star because it would not publish otherwise.,1507334400,,166,4.387096774193548
7859992,1,6304040210,"My wife and I rented this and both of us hated this movie. Hate isn't even a strong enough word! We despise this movie, we abhor this movie. It HAS to be one of the WORST films I've ever seen in my life. It's like a bad high school production of a bad movie. The acting's bad, the script's poor, the cinematography stinks, and there's NO background music/film score except for a few cheesy montages. I wouldn't watch this again if I was paid for my time.",1316822400,,454,4.2298850574712645
7859993,4,6304040210,"Like all of Henry Jaglom's films, this one is nearly all dialogue. What action exists is rather stilted. Some of the same character actors who've appeared in films from the 70s and 80s appear. This is an entertaining film about 30 something women who develop baby fever. Having been there, done that, I can testify to its acute accuracy.",1215475200,,337,4.728813559322034

To further complicate matters, she might be pregnant herself. In the mist of this unsettled personal life, Gena leaves her two men to attend a baby shower party for a girl friend and talks with the various female attendees all of whom are facing their own ticking biological clocks.

7859995,5,6304040210,"Like all of Henry Jaglom films, Babyfever will only appeal to the top 20% of the world's population that are intelligent enough to understand and appreciate the genius of Henry Jaglom's films and who actually bother to honestly think about where their lives have been, presently are, seem to be going, and why.  This film is a MUST SEE for all who've had children and who still can have children or who plan to have families through alternative means.  There has never been a film before or since that maps out the treacherous territory of contemporary motherhood.  Those who love this movie should also be sure to read Anne Crittenden's ""The Price of Motherhood"" for further discussion and exploration of these issues.  This film is one of my favorite films of ALL TIME!",1047340800,,771,4.774436090225564
7859996,3,6304040210,"Having recently discovered Jaglom's films, particularly Eating, and Last Summer in the Hamptons which featured the charming Melanie Mayron look-alike Victoria Foyt (and Jaglom's wife), I was curious about this title. However the extreme reactions of the existing reviews gave me caution. The format is similar to Eating, where straight to camera interviews are intercut with a narrative. Jaglom's strength is in presenting cinema verite conversations between actors, but since he takes nearly an hour to begin the baby shower that the cast assemble for, we have to endure Foyt with Matt Salinger. These scenes feel improvised to the miniscule degree and Foyt overplays her discomfort, especially when she barks to release tension. Her energy in general here seems lower than it was in Hamptons, and soon her anguish over Salinger and whether or not she is pregant to him becomes tiresome. There is an unnecessary diversion with Zack Norman as the husband of the shower hostess, Norman being the least talented of the Jaglom/Emil/Norman triumvirate. Thankfully Eric Roberts turns up for one scene (odd casting even for Jaglom) as a past suitor and brings some edge. However things pick up for the shower when the film populates. Jaglom amusingly shows us a wall of cascading water to coincide with the confirmed pregnant women, though surprisingly the one with a born child is removed quickly. Foyt is better when she has scenes with the deep-voiced Dinah Henney, and scores a laugh when the aforementioned baby reacts badly to her. I liked Henney's line referring to Salinger, that you can't marry someone who deals in golf metaphors. The range of opinions expressed to camera covers alternative views, including career women with no interest in childbirth, a lesbian couple, women married to men who don't want children, those infertile, and those who believe motherhood has deprived them of careers. We also get a female doctor on hand, who herself looks pregnant, to deliver technical advice which bogs down proceedings. Perhaps the confessions have less depth and reveal less pain than the shameful feelings on display in Eating, but I guess this topic is less prone to such negative emotions. Unlike the end of Eating where Jaglom identified each actor by face and name, there are some quirky touches that I am unable to attach to an actor, though perhaps not being able to identify the singer who delivers some bum notes in her performance is a blessing.",977011200,2,2460,5.076543209876543
7859997,1,6304040210,"Now, this may read strangely coming from a Jaglom fan, and a young father at that, but ""Babyfever"" was excrutiating to watch.  I made it roughly midway and had to (1) stop, (2) rewind and (3)return.  Sorry.",946944000,3,206,4.54054054054054
