3098284,3,B0012S3NZI,the historical information is interesting but the presentation is a little boring. the narrator's voice is a little boring and they also breeze by the fact that slaves built the white house.,1391212800,,190,4.96875
3098285,4,B0012S3NZI,"It was full of very interesting historical information. I would have liked it to have included more than just Arlington, Vietnam, Jefferson, Washington, and Lincoln memorial information..",1373241600,,187,5.962962962962963
3098286,5,B0012S3NZI,"Another movie we always show on our trips from Southeastern Indiana to Washington, DC with 50 VETERANS on a three day bus trip.  There's so much to see and do and this helps for them to see what is in DC.",1358812800,,204,3.975609756097561
3098287,4,B0012S3NZI,"I ordered this to replace my VHS copy recorded from way back when the History Channel first went on the air -- needless to say, the VHS quality was rather poor.  I really enjoy this series and the amount of detail that they get into about each monument -- not too much, but certainly going beyond the superficial with a lot of interesting historical nuggets.  Unfortunately, this was (at least) a 4-part series and this DVD only includes 3 parts (part 4 features the Library of Congress, National Archives, and Supreme Court).  I'm sure they had a reason for omitting it, but I can't imagine why.  So I'll convert my VHS copy of that episode to digital and live with it for now.",1356739200,2,678,4.487804878048781
3098288,5,B0012S3NZI,"This DVD gave a very good overview of the monuments. I was planning a trip to DC, but couldn't see everything in the short time that I had. This DVD helped me determine which monuments I really wanted to visit. Anyone visiting DC should know that -- as of this writing -- the Washington Monument is closed because of damage sustained during last year's earthquake.",1339632000,,364,4.615384615384615
3098289,5,B0012S3NZI,"I purchased this DVD with the expectation of playing it in the van while we traveled to Washington D.C. for a Spring Break trip.  In addition to the literature I had amassed in planning the trip, I thought the kids, and I, would learn a few things about the sites we were about to see from the DVD.  Turned out that the kids didn't want to watch it going out to D.C., but did opt to view it on the return trip.  Ten hours, each way, is a lot of time in the 'ol mini-van!  The DVD was a nice change of pace from the movies we had loaded up.  The kids were 10 and 12, and we all thought it was worth a viewing/listen.  I'll break it out again when we take our two younger kids to D.C. in a few years.
One word of warning - allow three weeks for delivery of the DVD, if you want it by a certain date (like before a Spring Break trip!)  I had a window of 12 days for the delivery. It arrived the day before we left, one day after the 'last' quoted date of its expected arrival.",1302825600,3,973,3.8838383838383836
3098290,4,B0012S3NZI,"Did not focus equally on all the monuments.  Very interesting detail about Arlington cemetary.  Interesting, but goes a little long on some parts of the Arlington cemetary, at least, that viewing got a little trite.",1271808000,3,215,5.114285714285714
3098291,5,B0012S3NZI,"I live in Califorina and had a few business trips schedule in D.C.
They made the flight much more enjoyable and were very interesting.
My intent was to sneak off to see the momuments but never got the chance
but was still happy that I purchased them.
I saw the Monuments in the 80's and it did back happy memories.
I also watch the with my dad who is a history buff and he also really enjoyed them and learn new things.",1210464000,5,419,4.121951219512195

8247542,5,B0012S3NZI,"I purchased this for grandson, age 10.  It is a very good, educational video. Almost 3 hrs! It has considerable narrative, background history and is great for ages 15 and higher, perhaps. Just a little too long in narrative for young kids. But nevertheless, it is a good purchase. My grandson will grow into this and one day look back on his trip to DC and at that time, he;ll be more interested in the longer videos. It breaks the topics down into segments and then, there is about a 15-20 minute history, background of the monument's history, etc.  For young kids, it will not hold their attention long enough. Still- -it is worth purchasing.",1429056000,,644,4.591304347826087

8247544,3,B0012S3NZI,"My Review is based on  a VHS version of Great American Moments by The History Channel. It covers only the White House and has a running time of only 50 minutes. It was released in 1994. To be fair,I was not very impressed at all. It was a collection of B & W (naturally from the early days) and color. None of the photography was inspired,the commentary even less so. It reminded me of the photography and text that you'd expect to get from older travel guides or brocheures. If anything ,I got the feeling that when The History Channel decided to make this documentary that all they did was gather up an hour's worth of old stuff from archives and patch it all together. Granted this was produced in 1994,that's 20 years ago. I am a big history fan,and also a fan of The History Channel,which produces great stuff these days;but this VHS was then. Don't get me wrong though; there was nothing wrong with the quality of this tape,but the quality of its content. and I am sure it would be much better if done these days. I can't vouch for the later DVD as I haven't seen it;but it should be better if it was produced in 2006,but I really don't know.",1421193600,,1148,4.339534883720931
