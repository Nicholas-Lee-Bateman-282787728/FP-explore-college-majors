1235173,5,B00000JMQB,"This is a sort of ""Best Thomas Trainwrecks"" collection.  It is a series of five minute stories, each involving trains that derail, crash into one another, drive into water or get covered by dirt.  It is great fun.  My two year old, who is a Thomas addict, loves this video and just laughs with glee with every wreck.
Alec Baldwin's narration is excellent.  This is a must have video for your Thomas collection!",976060800,4,410,4.575342465753424
1235174,4,B00000JMQB,"Another favorite of my son's collection.  I think that the enthusiasm in Alec Baldwin's characters is what I like the best. My son (2.5) will sit  through at least half of it in rapt attention.  Plus nothing in the plot  needs explanation!  No ""what"" ""whys"" or  ""wheres"" to handle!",966297600,4,281,4.63265306122449
1235175,5,B00000JMQB,"This is a wonderful Thomas video.  It's funny, but it also teaches many good lessons.  Our favorite stories are ""Bye, George,"" ""Horrid Lorries,"" and ""Something in the Air.""  We love  the music video and think that it's very funny.  This video is enjoyable  for Thomas fans of all ages.",950400000,5,285,4.714285714285714
1235176,5,B00000JMQB,"excellent children's video. my 2 y/o daughter loved it and will sit and watch it over and over. the music video ""accidents happen"" was very well done.",948931200,2,150,4.592592592592593
1235177,5,B00000JMQB,"Percy is saving Toby from a flood, getting ""Put Upon"", he and his engine friends turn lorries into the broken words:""Smashed,Broken,and Sunk."", and is too busy for the likes of the Troublesome Trucks.",946684800,,200,5.090909090909091
1235178,5,B00000JMQB,"""Races, Rescues and Runaways"" is a great video.  The animation is more realistic than previous Thomas videos, it introduces new characters and  Alec Baldwin's narration is much improved over the 1998 effort,  ""Thomas the Tank Engine:  Cranky Bugs.""  More important, the kids  love it, which makes it worth every penny!",942105600,24,318,5.26
1235213,5,B00000JMQB,"This Thomas video has a whole bunch of crash sequences in it and every time I see an accident in Thomas, I start laughing so you can imagine how much I laughed while watching this video. Although, Percy is just the same old engine again; whining and complaining about all the work he has and feels that he is ""put upon"" with so much work. But let's put Percy aside shall we and focuse on the hilarious stories on here:

Toby And The Flood 5/5:

It's a stormy day on the Island of Sodor and Toby is miserable because of all the dark clouds. He is sent on patrol to see how bad the storm really is and finds out that the dam is breaking so he hurries back to warn everyone. But on his way, while crossing a bridge, the dam collapses and sends Toby down stream. Can he make it to safety in time before the river takes him down the waterfall?

Put Upon Percy 4/5:

Percy is whining and complaining that he is being put upon with work. Thomas pays no attention to him and tells him that he's just a silly engine. But when there is an avalanche at the quarry, will Percy be able to save himself and his driver in time?

Horrid Lorry 4.5/5:

Cranky tells the engines that they are too slow and delay the ships at the docks. He says that a lorry should take over their jobs. The engines are furious and hope that a lorry does not come, but one does, along with two other ones. The lorries are very rude to the engines and take over their work. Pretty soon there is no work left for Toby. Will the lorries continue this madness? Find out in this story.

Bye George! 5/5:

George just can't stand railways. One day, he is ripping up an old railway when Thomas goes by with some freight cars. George starts saying how bad railways are but Thomas can't hear him. George thinks that Thomas is ignoring him and this makes him mad. He soon ends up causing trouble.

Something In The Air 5/5:

Thomas is a bit late to the docks with Henry's load for The Flying Kipper. Thomas tries to warn Henry that there is danger on the rails but Henry doesn't listen. And because of that, he ends up swimming with the fish.

Oliver's Find 3.5/5:

Oliver has an accident with some freight cars, so Sir Topham Hatt has him run the mail train for a while. One night, Oliver gets lost and Sir Topham Hatt gets worried. When he finally finds Oliver, he finds something else very interesting.

""Accidents Will Happen""(Music Video) 6/5:

A fun and catchy song that is a great addition to this video, since it talks about accidents.

I'd recommend this Thomas video. It is funny and even sad at time but it will provide lots of entertainment to the whole family.",1099958400,9,2626,4.287449392712551
1235214,4,B00000JMQB,I've critized Alec Baldwin again and again but i'm sorry he's ruining great characters such as Percy and James. In my Thomas listmania I called Percy a whiner. Well I think he know is. In this one and then in Percy's Chocalte Crunch he whines about hard work. I mean some of them complain but he whines. That's just plain annoying. The best episode one this tape was probably the Lorry one and i'd like to point out the fact that Butch does not have a face. Bye George was just plain stupid. Oliver was good in his episode and I wish he'd have more of those. This tape is ok and it would be good for Thomas fans to have. Before you buy this one take a look at some of George Carlin's works first belive me their better.,1076630400,,719,4.142857142857143
1235215,5,B00000JMQB,"Thomas and Friends never fail me in entertaining my three-year-old.  The stories are always short and simple, but interesting enough to keep a kid's attention.  This one is especially entertaining because of all the flooding, crashes, and angry characters who eventually learn a lesson or two in the end.",1058832000,2,304,5.183673469387755
1235216,5,B00000JMQB,"Thomas & his friends like to race to the rescue when in trouble.
In this release, Thomas & his friends teach some horrid lorries a lesson, say bye bye to George the steamroller, & get to see Henry in trouble. But it was really the driver's folt Henry had a accident. Sir Topham hatt should blame it on them! I say this DVD for all ages!",1049846400,6,336,4.106060606060606
1235217,5,B00000JMQB,"In this installment of Thomas and Friends, Alec Baldwin takes viewers on yet another set of Thomas adventures.  My son is a huge fan of Thomas, and we watch his videos almost every day.  This tape in particular has become one of his favorites.  The first story especially grabs his attention due to the dam breaking during the flood, Toby floating helplessly past the sign that says ""Beware the Waterfall"", which my son has memorized by now, and the heroic rescue by Harold the helicopter. He also enjoys the story of the Lorries; three spunky little trucks which are supposed to replace the engines, but in the end its the Lorries who can't perform their work.
As with other Thomas videos, this is just the right lenght to hold my son's interest without him becoming distracted.  The stories are bright and cheerful, and Alec Baldwin makes an excellent narrator.  I highly recommend the Thomas video series.  Buy one or several of this series and enjoy them with your children.  You might even learn something along the way!!",1043107200,4,1026,4.762711864406779
1235218,1,B00000JMQB,"I have a 21 mo old boy who loves to see Thomas & friends, however  when a disaster happens he screams and becomes upset.  I'll put this one away until he's much older.  I think this is very disturbing for young ones!!",987465600,4,217,4.119047619047619
1235219,5,B00000JMQB,"A Thomas fan once, a Thomas Fan for life--or that is how I feel about my son's favorite character.  This collection of Thomas stories is great.  A direct interpretation from the original stories, it brings the characters from the book alive.  My son loves it.
On a separate note, the live animation and lack of a lot of special effects is a refreshing change from a lot of the other kids movies out there.  It lets kids' imagination to develop and that is why I think that my son watches this tape over and over and over....",983232000,9,524,4.371134020618556
7912875,1,B00000JMQB,"Seems awfully ""dark"" in nature for a young child.  I can't say that we watched any of the clips all the way through.  We kept fast forwarding to find a ""better"" episode, but we finally gave up.  Dwelling on destruction does not deepen a young child's understanding of how to make sense of the world.  My two year old grandson was entrhalled while watching, but not in a good way.  After just a few minutes, I declared this a ""bad video"" because Thomas's friends were not nice at all.  I then checked with a couple of older boys - 10 year olds - who said they ""hated"" Thomas the Tank Engine shows.  I know some kids love this type of entertainment but we much prefer Kipper and Spot for relaxing before naptime.  Thomas is on his way out the door!",1433030400,,746,4.2785714285714285

7912878,1,B00000JMQB,"Many of the Thomas the Train books and videos are way too scary for my 2 & 1/2 year old son.  He started having nightmares after watching one episode about Halloween once. I was watching with him, but it was still too much for him. He is a very intelligent, sweet, sensitive child and I'm very careful about what and how much TV he watches. I think this show is very inappropriate for younger children, and too dumb for older children.  The creators are either not parents or not conscious parents.",1313366400,2,498,4.461538461538462
7912879,2,B00000JMQB,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves Thomas, so I was excited to buy him this DVD. However, this collection includes episodes about mudslides, floods, and something about being trapped in a mine. The first (and only) time he watched it, he kept running out of the room to hide in another room. What a disappointment. I don't know why the creators of shows for small children think they have to make things scary. What a waste.",1216598400,4,417,4.428571428571429
7912880,5,B00000JMQB,"Thomas the Tank Engine Races, Rescues and Runaways is a wonderful DVD with fantastic adventures that keep my 3 year old grandson entertained for hours.  He loves the stories and wants the songs over and over.",1212192000,,208,4.777777777777778
7912881,2,B00000JMQB,"The contents are all right but I was disappointed to hear it all in American English voices and slight ""ethical"" adaptations from the real deal like not call the fat controler by the name used in the origonal version. My kid doesn't seem to mind though.",1189641600,,253,4.521739130434782
7912882,5,B00000JMQB,"I have to laugh.  We got this video and it had my kids (boy and girl; 3 and 5 respectively) sitting on the edge of their seats.

It's the music and Alec Baldwin's narrative that makes this video a success.  They really managed to bring a little 'peril' to Sodor, but it is nothing scary.

Another thing we like about this collection of videos is that there are alot of the lesser known characters such as George, Duck, Skarloey, Oliver, and Toad.

Titles are:

Toby and the Flood
Put Upon Percy
Horrid Lorry(s)
Bye George!
Something In The Air
Oliver's Find

Five Stars.  A good addition to the home video sheds.",1120521600,15,612,4.45045045045045
