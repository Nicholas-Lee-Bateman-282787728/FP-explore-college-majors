5457949,3,B00AN10NU8,"I rent a fair amount of low budget suspense/thriller/horror type movies from Redbox or am scrounging around on Netflix looking for these type of films.  Often, I discover movies that are so terrible that I rarely make it through the first thirty minutes to an hour before I turn them off.  So, it is always a pleasant surprise to find a film that I will watch all the way through and it is even a bigger surprise when I enjoy the film after completing it.  So, I will place my rating within that context. This movie was an absolute hidden diamond on Netflix. A fair amount of the film had a House of Leaves feel in that there is a house where all sorts of strange things happen and the visitors cannot leave.  In a nutshell, this film is about two families viewing a home for sale and become trapped in the home by some strange supernatural means.  What occurs throughout the rest of the film is the interactions between the characters and their attempt to escape the house and strange things within. For a low budget independent film, the story is interesting albeit strange, the tension is engaging, the acting is fairly good and the story moves fairly well along. If you like strange, suspenseful movies, give this movie a try. I do not write reviews very often but I felt compelled to write a review for this because I am always looking for hidden gems on Netflix or Redbox.",1364083200,43,1378,4.47410358565737
5457950,5,B00AN10NU8,I have seen this movie and didn't want to because horror is not my type of film. But it's really not a horror movie - there's no gore - but it sure is suspenseful and builds to a surprise climax. See it.,1359072000,5,203,3.857142857142857

5457954,5,B00AN10NU8,"If you watch Prime horror there's no way this should get anything less than 5 stars! The acting/production is excellent and the script is cunningly wicked. Someone else said this is more of a psychological thriller than horror, I would say true except that thrillers are included in the horror genre for some reason, though this does have a large supernatural aspect to it. Fear is generated not by monsters or demons but by circumstance... expertly done as well. You don't need anything external to feel fear, being trapped is enough. You're trapped, you can't get out, and you're going to die. That's all you need, and the beauty of that premise is that people think a certain way, they keep convincing themselves they can escape even after the signs that they can't keep coming. This builds a tension, which just keeps on building-you get a clue as to how to get out-then its ripped away... I really enjoyed this and I don't think its rebound from all the high-school film projects masquerading as movies. THIS IS GOOD STUFF!",1493942400,2,1028,4.748603351955308
5457955,5,B00AN10NU8,"This is one of my favorite kinds of 'horror/suspense' type movies.  It's actually DIFFERENT.  I love when I come across a movie that is not just a run-of-the-mill horror or done every-other-day suspense.  I am not a movie aficionado, so it's quite possible this has been done before; however, it is not common and I bet it's not something most of you will be familiar with, either!  (The only other movie I can think of that's close is an Asian horror movie loosely based on Hansel and Gretel, which was also great and I can't wait to see again.)  As with most movies of this type, you do of course have to suspend belief in reality somewhat.  But, please don't let that keep you from enjoying this movie with a pretty original idea.  I'm not going to rave as highly on the acting.  But, still definitely worth watching :)",1489449600,,822,4.469798657718121

5458010,3,B00AN10NU8,I like this film because it introduced a new twist on families being held captive by some unknown force.  What makes this film work is dynamics of the two families and the back story that is revealed.  There is only so much you can do when the majority of the film is in one location.  I feel the actors really carried this film.  If you enjoyed the film Farm House with Steven Weber you will probably enjoy this film.,1471392000,,418,4.253164556962025

I'm still horrified to the point of speechlessness... Now when it comes to horror films, I'm mostly desensitized to your typical jump-scares and obvious haunting stuff...but this is psychological horror, the only horror that can scare me anymore, and I can assure you that this has beyond exceeded my expectations to the point of I want to curl up in a ball in the corner and just cry.

Overall okay and better than many films, but what really makes this one stand out and what will keep most people up at night is not the very few and far between scares...it is the vast multitude of missed opportunities to make a good, cohesive, and compelling story.  I personally will probably be up for a while thinking of the half dozen or more places where this story could have gone right.  In the end, we have a predictable, boring, slow paced film.  The acting and effects are good, but there is no depth to the story.  The family members never engage in any form of logical, problem solving about their situation-let alone any existential self-exploration which anyone in such circumstances would logically find themselves compelled to conduct.  I see this film as just one long, unexciting misfire.

I have no idea why I kept watching this movie because there was no indications that it was going to get better so I can only blame myself for not walking away.  The acting was flat with nothing to draw you into the characters and there were stupid little things thrown into the story line that you assume will build up to the explanation of what is truly going on but they don't.  It's as if there were a few stories going on at once yet none of them ever reached a full conclusion.  Do not believe the reviews about this being a ""hidden gem"" or ""give it a chance"" because those were likely written by the actors themselves as they desperately hope that someone will finally watch this garbage.

None of it made any sense and even the dramatic moments fell flat because the acting was so flat that any scene meant to be dramatic garnered the same reaction you'd give to someone spilling a can of soda.  Ah, oops, oh here's a towel....on to the next scene.",1466985600,,1001,4.32620320855615

And if each person was reliving their biggest sins why didn't the one without sin get away? Not to mention if there is a way out and you know how to get out, why wouldn't you?? I don't think people would act like this if in fact a scenario like this was to ever happen. And some of the actors were just bad. I get that it was low budget though, so you work with what you got.

This movie is creepy, it remembers that the best thing about haunting stories is that what haunts people the most aren't just the ghosts of strangers from some distant past that move furniture around, but ghosts from their own pasts. And this movie takes us on a well paced ride through our characters demons and provides some good surprises along the way. And I wasn't at all disappointed in the ending, it was credible...maniacal, but credible.
If you're looking for gore and/or jump scares you won't find it here. If you are looking  for creepy, character driven, atmospheric ""chiller"" than I highly recommend that you check this out.",1464566400,,724,4.8861788617886175

Pretty decent movie that I enjoyed, although I thought it focused way too much on the thin father. It needed a different actor for that to be passable.
Afterwards I realized I think I might have liked it more than it deserved because the house reminded me of the cabin in Mama. Be that as it may, I really did enjoy the movie.

Two things about the plot I could not shake (listen up writers) the girl they found, couldn't she write what happened to her?  It is far fetch no one had her write what happened.  The second issue i had was the husband of the last couple standing (wife was a nurse) had done some previous wrong doings but wouldn't he know the house number of his previous transaction/ misdoing while viewing the house? That were the two glaring issues I had.  Finally, normally amazon has the worst actors on the face of the planet but these actors were top notch for a horror movie.

5458491,4,B00AN10NU8,"Recently disappointed by the low-budget offerings, I went into this movie with no real expectations, and boy was I surprised! Marc Singer gave a wonderful performance as Charlie, a father with hidden secrets.  Hayley DuMond portrayed Charlie's wife, Susan, and slipped into her role as 'the other woman' very nicely, working hard to befriend and make nice to Charlie's daughter, Emmy, portrayed by Janey Gioiosa. Emmy was a fairly typical angst filled teen that hates her stepmom. The true acting gems in this movie, however, were Art LaFleur and Victoria Vance as husband and wife, Don and Leslie. Art gave an impeccable performance as a stoic tough guy that truly loves his family, while Victoria gave a believable performance of a long suffering housewife - and third grade teacher - that is feeling deep grief.

Two families go to view a home during an open house; a dream house, fairly secluded farmhouse on seventy acres and asking price was definitely affordable. Charlie almost hits a girl, Hannah, on their way to the house. Don and Leslie pull over to offer assistance; together, they all discover Hannah has no tongue. They try to take her to a hospital, but quickly discover all exits take them right back to the house. Time passes with Susan continually complaining about being stuck there in a passive-aggressive attack against Charlie and Emmy. Leslie slips deeper and deeper into depression and madness, seeing her deceased daughter Lizzy - portrayed by Emma Rayne Lyle to perfection - as she cooks and cleans the house and essentially 'mothers' everyone there.

I won't spoil the ending, so no true spoilers here. There was a creepy factor surrounding the house - which was actually quite lovely when the creepiness was removed - and a definite spook factor in the filming. Lighting and sound was excellent with no scenes too dark to see what's about to happen and no scenes where sound blasts or quiets so much you strain to hear what is happening. Honestly, I expected the ending, but was not disappointed with the outcome because actor portrayal was spot on. Thumbs up on this flick!",1463356800,2,2103,4.901685393258427

The violence isn't quite as graphic in this movie as in some, but there are some scenes that are certainly not suitable for preteens and below. The story lines were sub-par.

5458594,3,B00AN10NU8,"House Hunting (Eric Hurt, 2013)

It's the very end of March, and I am finally getting round to seeing the first movie to cross in front of my eyes that was actually released in 2013. And I have to admit, since the big draw in the promo materials seemed to be the presence of Marc Beastmaster Singer, I can't say I was expecting a lot. But the movie, which shares a number of aspects with a bunch of other flicks I've seen over the past decade or so and handles them with, if not originality, at least freshness and enthusiasm, was a good deal more fun than I expected it to be.

...and here it is in early December and I am finally getting around to finishing this review. (Which you probably won't see until well into 2014. I'm a little behind.) Which says nothing at all about the quality of the movie; it's basement-budget, and you've certainly seen it before (personally, I most recently saw a lot of these plot twists in the underrated YellowBrickRoad), but it's got a low-rent cleverness and a general air of affability about it that I found engaging. The basic idea: two families, both in the market for a new place, find themselves coming to the same house at the same time for a self-guided tour (with those silly tape-recorded audio portions you find in low-rent museums and such). There's the Hays family, headed up by dad Charlie (Singer), and the Thomsons, headed up by dad Don (Cobra's Art LaFleur). Once they enter the house, the discover that every time they try to leave the property, they wind up back at the house, the playthings of the spectre of the house's former owner. And the price he lays upon them for leaving is a high one indeed.

There is, of course, a method to the madness, and the families have to try and figure out why they're stuck here before the house offs them all (or they get around to killing one another as tensions flare; both fathers, especially, come to believe that they're innocent victims, while the other family is to blame for getting them involved in this mess), so there's some semblance of a plot, and the characters, while not anything approaching three-dimensional, are at least well-drawn enough that the viewer doesn't feel stupid investing a touch of emotion into caring at least a little what happens to some of the trapped folks. It's not a bad little movie, well-paced, fun, and not nearly as stupid as it could, and probably should, have been; you're not going to come out of this thinking it's a classic, but you probably won't feel like you've wasted your time, either. ** ",1406851200,,2538,4.559210526315789

5458597,1,B00AN10NU8,"I am ashamed of myself for sticking it through to the end...spoiler alert....

If it took me all of 5 seconds to figure out that walking backwards works then why did this completely go right over everyone else's head? Emmy was walking backwards and figured out she was almost to the road when Douchebag shows up to try to rape her. She tells everyone that she was walking backwards so one of the dads goes outside and figures out how to leave. Then once he is killed by one of the ladies they all act like they have no idea how he figured out how to get out of the house. What?! It's completely obvious! Emmy told him she walked backwards, he went outside and walked backwards! What is so hard about that?

Not only that... the girl with no tongue... is that really supposed to shut her up? You mean there isn't a writing utensil in that entire house? There isn't any way she could have used a piece of soot or charcoal from all the firewood they were burning to write? You mean that Emmy in the end when her tongue was cut off couldn't find a way to write? You mean she couldn't just walk backwards?

Sorry, these things just had me stomping on the ground mad! When people don't do what real people would do in certain circumstances... and instead do the only thing that will fit to the story or progress the plot, it is utterly annoying to me.

If not for these two simple things... them being utterly clueless to the whole walking backwards thing...even though they already figured it out... and them not finding some way for the no tongue girl to write... then I might have liked this movie. The acting wasn't really that bad at all. The characters went from regular old dysfunctional family members to straight up crazy (most of them) and they played the parts well. The women were all completely hysterical as always, not sure if that is hard as far as acting goes or not, but they played that well.

When the plot holes in a movie are just too glaring it can really irk me. Sorry, didn't car for this movie towards the end... I find it hard to watch without just screaming at the screen ""JUST WALK BACKWARDS!!!! COME ON!!! JUST WALK BACKWARDS!!!!! UGGGGHHHHH!!!!""",1394928000,2,2170,4.428571428571429

5458599,4,B00AN10NU8,"I have a few reservations but taken on a whole (suspending your disbelief a bit in order to accept the premise) House Hunting is on par with some of the better haunted house films.  Unfortunately the bloody photo of Marc Singer on the cover of the DVD package is mis-leading - making the film appear to be a slasher movie which it isn't. (at least not very much) This type of marketing will disappoint gore hounds and illicit negative reviews causing the rest of us to miss a this spooky little film.

The premise and this is not giving away much.  A couple of house hunting families visit a secluded house that's for sale in a wooded area..  For reasons better left unsaid. these folks find themselves unable get more then1000 feet from the house and there is no force-field of dome nvolved either.  The reason  is  much more creepy.

There is nothing unusual about the house or its location which makes it all the creepier.  The look of the house bares none of not the haunted house cliches. There are no dark and stormy nights.  Most of what takes place is in broad daylight in what appears might be a typical fall day that seems to go on forever.  As the unwilling quests begin to get on each others nerves, a bit of the supernatural begins to show itself.

House Hunting is an understated horror film relies more on interesting characters, a deliberate tempo. good music, eerie atmosphere and an imaginative story  and not CG. Director Eric Hurt showed great restraint by keeping special effects and the usual tired attempts at shocks to a bare minimum. What Mr. Hurt did create was a haunted house film that gradually draws you into the troubled world of the characters and their ""non-adjustment"" to a house they visited and may never leave.

I would recommend this film to audience's who appreciate subtle spooky films along the lines of the original Haunting, The Innocence, the Yellow Wallpaper or some of the great Val Lewton films. I subtracted one star - why? mostly because of some holes and a few illogical things that just don't add up.

Because the film is otherwise very good and in order to enjoy the film more I overlooked these items. Read the spoilers below if your interested - but do not read them before you see the film!

The following are my only reservations about this good Haunted House film - These are spoilers!!! There are a few shots of the ghosts where we see them for what they are - which I can only describe as appearing like the ""open mouth demon-like faces"" from ""The Ring.""  This has become an over-used cliche that only takes the viewer out of the film. The ghosts could have been more ambiguous  - is it ghosts or madness?  The final ""tongue cut scene"" in the film is rather obvious and tacky. This scene should have been implied not shown.  Finally there are numerous holes in the story, and a number of things that just don't add up: The spirit of a little girl returns to her mother which causes a problem between the parents - This plot point is interesting but is given no explanation.  There is no attempt at logical communication with the mute girl - anyone heard of writing? - simply not logical.  Finally the film seems to indicate that the ghosts are out for revenge  - if this is the premise -  then there is no logical explanation as to why the ghosts victimize the innocent Emma or the parents of the the teenage hit and run driver or for the ghost's to victimize the previous visitors or the following visitors for that matter.",1391904000,8,3483,4.527156549520766
5458600,2,B00AN10NU8,"Morality tale? Haunted house story? ""No Exit"" through a horror lens? The Shining meets the Brady Bunch? ""House Hunting"" aims for all of the above, but doesn't quite hit any. Its conceptual waywardness is exacerbated by meandering pacing, awkward characterization, and glaring plot holes. Still, the film's setting and atmosphere are well-rendered, and there are enough enjoyable scenes to keep the audience (well, me anyway) watching as it meanders towards an unsurprising conclusion.",1386892800,,484,5.6438356164383565

Two families are brought to the same 78 acre cabin in the woods by a ""realtor"" (who reminded me of a young Brad Dourif)  making a financial promise he obviously cannot keep.  Both families assenting to this illusion is what unfurls the ribbon of madness inherent in both families--Marc Singer (""Beastmaster"")  representing the madness best of all when his character takes an abrupt turn you may not see coming.  Ugly truths are revealed about the human psyche and the deep lies we often tell each other to keep our families together are ripped to bloody, word salad tatters.  This is an overlooked phenomenon which needs more attention.  That said, the director would have a masterpiece on his hands if he had elaborated on the mute girl and her ""diary"" a little bit more.

He has one leg in a brace, but his other two legs are working fine.

As you can tell by the trailer or write up, the home doesn't let them go. As it turns out they all have their dirty little secrets which come back to haunt them. The film develops slowly as you are unsure what is happening. Are they already dead? Is this a descent into madness (aka ""Yellow Brick Road"") or just a simple haunting? Or combination?

The problem is that they put too much into the film that when it came time to bring it home, sort of speak, that boredom started setting it. They needed to make the important end scenes as mysterious as the rest of the film. Some of the internal conflict seemed overdone. I understand it was because of the various secrets people had, in order to make the film work cleverly...and it did. But the actors couldn't do it, they were boring.

Both men find the lonely house in the pristine land appealing, but the mood immediately changes when they stumble across a strange, battered, terrified young lady (Rebekah Kennedy; Season of the Witch, Creature) with her tongue cut out running in the woods from something.  In an attempt to drive her to a hospital they find that the road continues to somehow return them to the house.  Again and again they drive away from the house only to be returned by some supernatural force.

Forced to stay in the house overnight, their sanity is tested and they begin to lose patience with one another.  There is no electricity, it's cold, and they find seven cans of ""stew"" in a cupboard--and there's seven of them.  Weird yet?  It gets weirder.  They see a strange man walking his dog who somehow disappears in front of them before they could ask him about the house and the next morning the cupboard has been somehow restocked with seven cans of stew.  Don's son Jason insists that the strange tongueless girl knows what's going on or, worse, that she is behind it somehow.

Days go by, stew is restocked, and attempts to leave on foot continue to return them to the house.  Another oddity is Jason, who taunts and comes on to Charlie's daughter and is clearly attracted to her stepmother as well.  Yet more weird, they start seeing other people that simply ""aren't there.""  This begins to steer character psychology and interactions.

As they do what they can to keep their limited sanity, passing time in the house, they learn that some of them are connected to the previous owners.  But as the days wear on, the number of stew cans restocked in the cupboard drops to six and things continue to get weirder.

This film never seems to go anywhere, yet it has no problem maintaining my interest.  This is one of those weird movies that keeps you guessing while giving you nothing.  There's not a lot of blood, but there's a lot to keep our attention.

8554470,3,B00AN10NU8,"Yeah, I mean, you can actually do worse than this movie... it does have a somewhat well constructed script and it sorta makes sense, feels a bit longer than it should but the acting is good, so go for it.",1528588800,,204,4.125

This one is actually pretty good. 2 families go see the same house for sale and can't leave. You'll have to watch to find out why. Plot is great and ending is great. Good stuff. One of the best movies on Amazon Prime Horror genre.",1528156800,,264,4.196078431372549

8554474,3,B00AN10NU8,"I watched this a coupe of times when it was on Netflix. The effects are not too bad and the acting is a little clunky at times, but it's interesting. It would be scarier with less creeping music during intense moments, though.",1515369600,,226,4.404761904761905
8554475,5,B00AN10NU8,"I've seen this before, and I liked it then too.  The premise is very unusual and the story is very well told.  It's creepy and horrifying in all the right places.  The changes the characters went through were brilliantly portrayed.  I did not get the point of the doppelgangers, that part puzzled me the first time I saw it too.  The only part that I didn't like was the way they accepted the way things were instead of trying to escape.  This won't be a spoiler, since it happens early; when they were driving around ending up at the house every time, I wondered why they didn't try the solution that Emmy did toward the end, and she almost succeeded.  I don't understand why they didn't immediately try that again.  Nevertheless, it is an extremely well done movie.",1510272000,,767,4.507246376811594

8554478,4,B00AN10NU8,"This film really needs more love - it has good effects, good story, good acting, good atmosphere, and it all adds up to a very creepy and entertaining piece about two families trapped in some sort of supernatural pocket dimension. The pacing is good and the chemistry between characters is good. Also, unlike a lot of horror films, this one starts with frantic panic, then settles into weeks and months of monotonous existence before the bloody climax - it shows us that there are many kinds of horror; sometimes, just existing day by day in a place you cannot leave is a kind of horror in itself.

If memory serves, there's a suggestion at the end that more than two families are involved, which seems a bit implausible given the house's motivations, but whatever - the rest of the story is great, so that part gets a pass.",1506902400,,824,4.5675675675675675
