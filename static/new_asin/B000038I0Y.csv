1260513,4,B000038I0Y,"When I rented this movie, I didn't expect too much.  I was very surprized by the end result. This movie starts off a little slow, but by mid movie the antics between French Stewart and Bridgette Wilson will have you  laughing your butt off.  Overall, this movie is very funny, I haven't  laughed this hard in a while.  I can't wait to add it to my collection!  Buy this!",956534400,,370,4.2898550724637685
1260514,5,B000038I0Y,"I have not laughed so much during a movie in a long, long time.  It was so refreshing to see a very funny French Stewart with big blue eyes as opposed to squinty eyes.  He is a very funny and talented man! His potential is not  seen on Third Rock. Bridgette was also very funny!  Loved her facial  expressions!  I had not seen her before and she was perfect for the part.  This was not a big budget movie, as the director's comments indicated, but  the director did a marvelous job on a budget.  And best of all, I laughed  until it hurt!",955497600,,538,4.135922330097087
1260515,1,B000038I0Y,"This movie is so annoying that it's still annoying me and I'm not watching it. Thinking about it annoys me.
Despite the title, this movie is not about love. It's about people being rude to each other. No one in this  movie is in love with anyone else with the exception of French Stewart's  love of himself. He appears to think he's pretty funny, but instead he is  just grating. Maybe he's funny for 22 minutes on that Third Rock sitcom  (I've never seen it) but 90 minutes of this guy is almost intolerable. Why  is he always grimacing? Does he know he looks like that?
The movie is  also completely degrading to women. It portrays them as materialistic,  scheming bimbos. This movie was obviously written by a guy who has been  ""burned"", but if he thinks as highly of women as he does of the  female characters in this script, it's no wonder.
And finally, the end is  cheap and anti-climatic and the last big laugh(?) was in the  trailer.
Boy, did I hate this one.",953856000,3,967,4.406779661016949
1260516,4,B000038I0Y,"This movie is really good.  Its worth it, and although I thought Bill Belamy was going to have a bigger part, it was a funny movie and you'll never guess what happens!  Buy it rent it whatever, just watch it!",950572800,3,208,4.175

1260569,5,B000038I0Y,"This is one of my favorite comedies. Great for couples, or the newely singled.
The story of a Hollywood TV writer, who falls for his best friend/co-writer's, new wife's, best friend. He thinks everything is great until she wants a ring. When he hesitates, things go downhill fast. She will stop at nothing to get what she wants, and a battle of the roses ensues.
Very entertaining. The delivery was fast and the movie played perfectly.",1477785600,,435,4.7368421052631575

1260593,4,B000038I0Y,"Not as funny as the movie trailer.....but what I like about the movie is its honesty of how alot of  women just play men for money.  It shows the sneaky ways women use to pressure for marriage so they can use the legal system to extort money from the man in the form of child support and alimony.  Going to keep the video with my Do not get married collections along with the documentary video Divorce Corp, and the book Undressing Infidelity.  That way when Im hooked again in a relationship and she pressures for marriage I can Look to my Do not get married book shelf.",1459036800,2,571,4.308411214953271

This slap-stick movie has fast become one of my favorites all because it has the power to be considered a precious cult movie, if only more people would just watch it.  Most females probably would not enjoy this, as the movie centers on a relationship gone wrong and the woman turns out to be the biggest bitch ever, but I find it highly amusing and was rooting for karma to come back around.  I am also a huge French Stewart fan and that was actually the reason I ended up watching this movie.

I don't think the critics liked it and I noticed the few poor reviews here on Amazon.  Based on their own reviews, it appears these people were looking for something in this movie that it was never meant to be.

It's over-the-top humor.  It's not meant to be realistic, just funny. Sometimes you sit down to watch a movie and suspend reality for the sake of just laughing and having a good time.  Everything is not meant to be analyzed and applied.  This is pure entertainment, nothing more.

1260747,2,B000038I0Y,"""Love Stinks"" is a generally unfunny comedy that will leave you wondering why anyone financed something that promised so little and delivered about what you would have expected from a simple-minded script and an unimpressive cast.

Fans of French Stewart (""3rd Rock From the Sun"") will at least be entertained by his many one-liners. Unfortunately they are the only elements that work in this ill-advised movie. Like a lot of this mid-budget stuff, ""Love Stinks"" places its characters in ultra upscale surroundings and shows them living posh life styles; trying to fool viewers into believing it is a high-end production. But few moviegoers come from the richest portion of the 20-something demographic. Those living a less than swank lifestyle found viewer identification difficult;  so the movie was quickly pulled from its theatrical distribution.

Almost everyone else will have difficulty connecting with the film, which is basically the story of Seth's (Stewart) efforts to escape the grasp of the beautiful Chelsea, his materialistic and totally controlling interior decorator. Like this is a continuing problem for all of us!

Chelsea is played by former beauty queen Bridgette Wilson (""I Know What You Did Last Summer""). Wilson is a better actress than she is given credit for as people tend to dismiss her because of a non-acting background, and she is well suited to this type of bad girl role. But the script gives her no opportunity to add dimension to this character.  At least most of us have seen this sort of mega-manipulative blonde at work. Desperate to marry, Chelsea gets the rich Seth in her sights, pressures him into a quick commitment, moves in and alters his priorities, then makes his life hell when he postpones the marriage. Most of this is told in an extended flashback, necessary for no reason other than to pad the running length so the movie will qualify as a feature.

Of course Wilson and Stewart's acting gets a boost by relative comparison to the barely competent performances of the supporting cast, which includes talent challenged Tyra Banks and Tiffany Amber Thiesen. Steve Hytner (Kenny Bania from ""Seinfeld"") also appears but adds little to the comic quality of the film.

""Love Stinks"" was written and directed by the guy who is blamed for creating ""Full House"" and ""Hangin' with Mr. Cooper"".

Ultimately, all you are left with are Stewart's occasional one-liners and Wilson's beauty. These are not enough to carry a whole feature film but are at least something for which to be thankful if you should be forced to actually view the entire film.

1260758,4,B000038I0Y,"The almost uniformly bad reviews of this movie by professional critics contrast sharply with mostly favorable reviews by customers. One wonders if some of the professional reviews were disingenuous, because a public thumbs up to Love Stinks might have required some explaining at home. The film is rude, abrasive, un-PC, and very funny.

It is the nature of modern romance that nearly every one of us has been involved with at least one psycho. The world is full of them and they come in both sexes: stalkers, vengeance-seekers, clingers, users, manipulators, and abusers of all types. They often are seductive (which is how they rope you in) and the final break-ups with them can be horrendous. The psycho in this case is a woman, so no doubt it is easier  for men to relate to and laugh at this movie, though the gender response, judging by other reviews, obviously is far from uniform either way. There is a lot of pain and cruelty in this film, but pain and cruelty, handled properly, are the meat of all humor. This is not as nasty as it sounds; humor is the way we best deal with such things. Love Stinks provides plenty of protein.",1176595200,3,1138,4.628712871287129

1260760,5,B000038I0Y,"I think anyone can relate to this film about a failed relationship turned love-hate. Although, sane people probably do not engage in this type of vindictive behavior. We can at least enjoy it for the hysterical revenge factor. Frenchie Stewart and Brigitte Wilson have terrific chemistry. Their pitched battles to deliberately antagonize and annoy each other after their love relationship goes south is delightful. It's reminiscent of ""War of the Roses"" starring Michael Douglas & Kathleen Turner which was much darker as a drama. This movie is lighter and comedic. Also, the scene where Brigitte dresses up as ""Elvis"" for a bedroom seduction scene is very funny. I highly recommend this psychotic comedy about love for anyone who has ever thought of seeking revenge against their ex.",1171670400,,784,5.181102362204724

I happened to see this movie by accident while flipping through the many cable channels I have. It starts off as your typical charming romantic flick (nothing special). But then, the relationship between French Stewart and Bridget Wilson starts to take a turn for the worst and that's when the dark comedic stylings of French Stewart comes out. You have to be impressed with a movie that starts light and by the time you see the ending...have you literally crying with laughter. I loved the one liners and there was great delivery on the toilet humor. If you have ever had a relationship with a woman that has 1/10th of the pyschoses that Bridget Wilson's character has in this movie, RENT IT and prepare to have a good time (matter of fact, just buy it for your collection). But if you're into comedies starring Meryl Streep and Catherine Hepburn, in the immortal words of French Stewart, ""Back to Hell Demon, Back to Hell!!!""",1104192000,5,1041,4.572192513368984
1260766,3,B000038I0Y,"This movie has most of the qualities that lead to success for a Hollywood production -- lots of implied sex, loads of beautiful people, a silly & ridiculous plot, and lots of humor. A romantic comedy in the vein of ""Blind Date"" and ""War of the Roses"", ""Love Stinks!"" is a funny movie with some mediocre actors that do a great job showing off their fine looks, good bodies and wonderful hair.

It is about a couple that loves each other seemingly to death, and carries out activities to wound each other in civil and serial terms. In the end one gets the better of the other but not by much. You don't really cheer for anyone in this movie although it's hard not to become attached to someone because they are all so damn beautiful!

No one will confuse this for a classic Tracy-Hepburn romantic comedy but it fills an evening real well with ultralight entertainment, mild humor, a few good laughs and great looking people in real tight clothes and super duper hair.

It was nice to see a refreshing comedy like this concidering all the teenie-bopper love comedies and old-fogie love stories (like Richard Gere). Finally a love story for the people between 19 and 40! The commentary is enjoyable as well with Stewart, Wilson and the Writer/Director, is funny as well. This is not just a comedy, it is a warning sign to men everywhere!",990403200,9,658,4.314516129032258
1260806,5,B000038I0Y,"This one caught me by surprise. I've always wanted to see French Stewart in movie and caught this on the satellite one night. I laughed till I cried. I watched it 2 more times that night and then I went online with Amazon and bought the DVD!
Bridgette Wilson and Stewart French do a great job with this underrated dose of comedy!  Everyone I've shown this movie to agrees that it has extraordinary ""entertainment value""!  I have discovered one thing however... it is not to be viewed by everyone.  Just a warning - DO NOT show this movie to a couple about to get married!! OOOHHH yeah... The movie watching ""comfort zone"" can become a little tense if you do!
This was a great movie that I would recommend to all of you with a true ""funny bone""!  A sense of humor and an open mind about relationships is required when watching this one!",989280000,11,835,4.402597402597403
1260807,1,B000038I0Y,"Right out of the chute, I have to tell you-- this is one scary movie.  That's right, scary.  I mean, to think that there are people running around out there in the world who actually think this kind of inane prattle is ""funny"" is downright frightening.  And if anything about ""Love Stinks,"" directed by Jeff Franklin, reflects real life in even some remote, unimaginable way, then please stop the world, I wanna get off.  This is a one note movie about a television sitcom writer named Seth (French Stewart), who gets involved with a woman, Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson),  with marriage on her mind and him in her sights.  She wants to, he doesn't, and that's about it; one note, and even at that, it's out of tune.  Unfortunately, what the makers of this movie would pass off as humor is no laughing matter; it's merely a no-joke display of mean-spiritedness and bad acting that is-- at it's best moments-- infantile, gross and disgusting.  Comedy, of course, is the most subjective of genres, and individual tastes and sensibilities will weigh in heavily in regards to how this movie will be received.  But to anyone with half a brain and any self-respect whatsoever, being subjected to ninety minutes or so of this would have to be considered nothing less than cruel and unusual punishment.  Suffice to say that after this debacle, director Franklin will not be making the Hollywood ""A"" list anytime soon.  Nor the ""B,"" ""C,"" ""D"" or ""F"" lists.  The good news for him is that whatever project he takes on next couldn't possibly turn out any worse than this,  and that means he's only got one way to go from here, and that's up.  As far as the performances go, French Stewart-- who obviously went into this with his eyes wide open-- had better hope that ""Third Rock From the Sun"" lasts, well...forever.  Because if this is the best he can manage after the jump-start his career's received from TV, he'd be well advised to take the ""Rock"" money and run.  And Bridgette Wilson?  What on earth could've possessed her to take this part?  With her talent and looks this is the best she could come up with?  It makes you wonder if she even read the script before signing on to this project.  I'd like to think she either owed someone a BIG favor, or better yet, was the victim of a plot by a bitter and disgruntled manager or agent to malign her for personal, as yet undisclosed, reasons.  The bottom line is, Stewart and Wilson both have a lot to offer; it just seems so sad to see them wasted in something as unworthy as this ridiculous, offensive movie that isn't worth the film that retains it's untoward images.  The supporting cast includes Bill Bellamy as Larry, Tyra Banks as Holly (proving here that beauty does not necessarily equate with acting ability), Steve Hytner as Marty, Jason Bateman (in a horrendous performance) as Jesse, and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen as Rebecca.  A supercilious effort that has to resort to bathroom humor, cat cruelty and an Elvis impersonator in it's feeble attempt at getting a laugh-- which it doesn't (and note that even the word ""humor"" is used loosely within the context of this sentence)-- ""Love Stinks"" is a movie to be avoided at all costs.  If someone perchance suggests to you that this one is entertaining and good for some laughs, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!  Or at least for the nearest exit.  Immediately.  And don't look back...",985392000,5,3363,4.66553480475382
1260808,5,B000038I0Y,"I just stumbled upon this movie because there was nothing else on TV that night! It was SO funny! I can't believe I've never heard of it before. I went online and bought the DVD that same night. It's one movie that you'll have in your collection that no one has seen yet! The critics gave it one star in the cable guide, but everyone that I show it to says ""This is hilarious!"" So, go ahead and buy it. It's great. I'd ignore the reviewer who gave it one star though. You really shouldn't watch (or rate) a comedy when you take life too seriously and don't have a sense of humor. No, it didn't get an Academy Award. So if you don't expect anything more than a good dose of laughter you'll love it!",982281600,3,697,4.132352941176471
1260809,1,B000038I0Y,"This movie was NOT funny.  I am a grown up that enjoys comedy that doesn't  demean women, act cruel towards others, or behave stupidly.  This movie  assumes that women are out to trap men into marriage in any way possible  and that men think only with their appendage.
French Stewart is a delight  on Third Rock, but this was not a good movie for his talents.  Bridgette  Wilson needs a better role, too.
If you are a grown up, don't bother  with this movie.  It stunk.",968544000,3,469,4.348837209302325

French Stewart and Brigitte Wilson are great. Any fans in comedy  genre should get this DVD at all cost. The picture and sound quality is  fine. I always think Brigitte Wilson is a very fine actress since I first  saw her in ""Billy Madison"" but then she appeared in small parts  in ""I know what you did last summer"" and ""House on haunted  hill"". I hope this movie can break her to a higher level. She is as  talented as says Sandra Bullock. Great movie.",965001600,2,613,4.135593220338983

Then  she turns on him. It would of all been avoided if he commited. This movie is  a great date flick. And is not JUST a chick flick...

1260812,5,B000038I0Y,"French Stewart and Bridgette Wilson are both excellent.  They play their roles like veteran stars. They both carry this movie from beginning to end and will have you laughing throughout.  There are too many good scenes to  name one favorite.  All of the Elvis humor and scenes are very well done.  Bridgette of course is beautiful and that alone will make it worth it for  the guys.  The ladies will enjoy the way the manipulation goes both ways  and is excellent for conversation and humor. The supporting cast was great  too.  The subtle humor is interwoven and seeing it twice will help you get  all the laughs.  I have never even watched French Stewart on TV but now  know one reason why the ""3rd Rock"" show is rated so high.  Enjoy!",959731200,2,737,4.526717557251908
