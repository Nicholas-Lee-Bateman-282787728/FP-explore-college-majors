8263425,5,B0016MXLXE,"One of three sporty musician sisters who live in a chintzy apartment in Budapest one night finds a bloody victim in pieces in the washing machine. She hits her head on the cat and by the time the cops arrive the victim has disappeared. The film then follows the sisters' adventures, which include cannibalism in lingerie and naked poledancing, and their part in the murder investigations. Budapest looks good and likewise all of the females in the film including the poledancers and rhythmic gymnasts.. The kinkiness of some of Deodato's other films such as House On The Edge Of The Park and Phantom Of Death is not apparent here. Choose from the Thai import or an amazon.uk print from Shameless where the steel case and the disc smell of soap when opened. Very clear print to be much enjoyed by both voyeurs and bloodhounds.",1416960000,2,825,4.736111111111111

I bought it more for the cover art then the movie it's self, But after watching it I realized that it was a really a worth while film. It starts out with a nice topless shot and just picks up from there . I would recommend the Washing Machine to anyone looking for old school thriller with a good story . There is enough nudity and violence to make anyone smile ...",1346976000,5,423,4.108433734939759
