8182679,5,B000O1713Y,"This a collection of four Films / Documentaries
There is much fascinating detai in these four documentaries which I have tried to summarise accurately -- my apologises for any errors

Rembrandt Painter of Man appears to be a film of a ncertain date --query the 1970s
I think it gives a over simplified view of Rembrandt

Restoration of the Nightwatch
In the mid 1970's the Nightwatch was attacked and had a number of slack marks
This is a Dutch documentary with good English narration
It takes one through the 8 month process of resorting the page noting from the initial emergency steps to removing the old liner to gain access to mend the cuts from behind
One follows the painstaking and complex task with the benefit of the visual image and the commentary
At times I wondered whether one would see the Night Watch as one re breed it (true the restores know what they were doing )  but one sees a very white colour blocking the painted surface part way through the restoration)
I found this programme very interesting

Rembrandt's Masterly Brushstrokes-- a scientific research of his paint
This a fascinating look at Rembandt's paints
A world authority on Rembrandt Ernest van de Wetering is our guide in this documentary
Scientists can take very small paint samples from Rembrandt paintings and look at the pigments used and also do chemical analysis to see if other substances were used. Some 15 pigments were available to Rembrandt
They also try to replicate making linseed oil as Rembrand would have in the lab
There was a large section on lead white -- was this important
Well the answer is yes.
They show trying to make lead white in the lab as Rembrandt would have made it and compare it to a modern Belgium artist who makes it as in Rembrandt's day ( in a special clay pot covered by Horse dung)
The modern lead white is rather runny but the old method ( horse dung )method the lead white is viscous and when the painter removes the brisk from the paint surface there the paint stays ( it don't run) this helps explain the beautiful Ruffs and Laces in Rembrandt's paintings. ( the particle size of the modern lead white is small and the uniform while the old version there is marked variability in particle size )

Rembrandt and his World
Ernest van de Wetering is our guide in this documentary to-- see introduction to last title
The main aim of this documentary is to show the world xpensive research and hard work that went into restoring the Rembrandt House in Amsterdam.
The is a background  skeleton documentary to Rembrandt's life and times -- this is mainly to illuminate aspects of Rembrandt's and his family's life and how it related to the Rembrandt House
We see Lieden were Rembrandt was born a miller's son
We briefly see a painting by the first artist he was apprenticed to, the to Peter Lastman -- who had a much greater influence
We see some of his early paintings and his rise to fame with The Anatomy lesson of Dr Tulp
Soon all the weathy wanted there portraits painted -- a a cost of 200 gulden -- a years wage for an ordinary craftsman
Rembrandt married, became rich and bought a large house for 15,000 gulden
He also bought a lage collection of art works, costumes, swords, shells , paintings, prints etc -- probably another 15,000 gulden worth
As most people know he went bankrupt
This was a disaster for Rembrandt but good for us.
The person responsible for dealing with the bankruptcy went throght the house with Rembrandt and noted every item he owned and where it was ( such and such painting on this wall etc ) it is from this detail that the team is partially able to reconstruct Rembrandt's House
Some paintings, drawings and etchings by Rembrandt show other details-- where his easel was, what the stove ( heater ) looked like in the room he painted in, etc etc
Paintings , drawings by his pupils also give evidence
The group of art historians, archivists, architects and others did a wonderful job in trying to make the house as close as possible to what it would look like in Rembrandt's day and a skilled team of craftsmen turned it into reality

Summary
