D'Lo Brown vs. Val Venus

way too long for an opener. venus isn't that bad but d'lo sucks. d'lo shouldent have this title hell he shouldent even be on ppv. 6/10

2. Oddites vs. Kai en tai

funny stuff here but serisouly kai en tai was crushed. you basically had 4 midgets vs. 3 giants. leads to comedy but no wrestling value. 4/10

3. Jeff Jarret vs. X - Pac in an hair vs. hair match

x - pac was on fire and jarret actually wasn't that bad besides his bad TNA stint. match of the night definatly. 9/10

4. Edge and Sable vs. Marc Mero and Jacgluine

the begining of edge's carear as we know it! edge actually looked good but that was it. mero sucks and the women wrestlers were just pure garbage. and for women fans that get angry at the men that think women wrestling sucks it is becasue they are bad wrestlers not becasue we are prejudice. 3/10

5. Ken Shamrock vs. Owen Hart in a Lion's Den match

another good match. this was the first of its kind of match and man shamrock was just so impressive and so was owen. not the best match of the night but still a good match. very brutal. 8/10

6. Mankind vs. New Age Outlaws for the tag titles

a good match but mankind was screwed. kane didn't show up this was no holds barred and even though mankind is one of the best in these matches he let NAO beat up on him. once again why isn't mankind in the main event? 6/10

7. Intercontial title

The Rock vs. HHH in a ladder match

good match. not the best ladder match as other people say but still a good one. if you are of fan of these wrestlers or ladder matches this is a good one to see. 8/10

8. WWE title

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Undertaker

man i remember this match. it was so hyped up and i just had to watch it but it ended up being okay. just okay. i don't get it how two of the best wrestlers in the bussiness two great brawlers good only have a good match. 8/10

overall - i wouldent give this ppv a high score becasue it was hyped up to be the ppv pf the year yet we only good medicore matches from what we thought would be classics.",1119484800,,2073,4.0244498777506115

933299,4,6304826214,"Summerslam 1998 is my first PPV that I bought. It's always been a classic to me because of all it's celebrities, good matches, and a main eveent that could have torn down Madison Square Garden. I'll detail each of the matches from a wrestling fan, and entertainment in general's point of view. I'll rate it on a scale from 1 to 10.

1. Val Venis vs. D-Lo Brown for the European Championchip-

  This is Val Venis's first Pay-Per-View but by then he was well known as a ladies man. The starts out with a lot of running and ducking, but as it progresses it becomes a very intense match. But from the get-go it was one sided because D-Lo had a heavy duty chest protector and was using that to his advantage. By the end Val gets pissed off and tears the chest protector off D-Lo and puts it on himself. The ref gets angry and tries to get it of him but Val ignores the ref. Val gets on the turnbuckle and the ref purposly tugs Val off so he'll hit his nuts. Val hits the ref, he calls for a DQ. But Val got his revenge minutes later.

Winner D-Lo Brown DQ Rating: 4/10

Valient fight to the end then goes downhill

2. The Oddities with the ICP vs. Kai En Tai

  This is the funniest match I have ever seen! Take three ugly oddities over 7 ft tall and pushing 400 pounds and them against four midget asian people and their distressed maneger. They say it was a handicapped match but I wondered if that made much of a difference. This match really emphasises the ""entertainment"" in ""sports entertainment."" I mean they couldn't knock down the Oddities, and whenever they got their hands on them they made them fly like birds through the ring, and over it. There was even one moment where Golga (an odditie) stole the managers sneaker and poured water in. As Jerry said ""He was physically abused and he lost his shoes."" In the end the Oddities won with a double chokeslam and a big splash over the four of them.

Winner The Oddities Pinfall Rating 7/10

Sorta long but hillarious =)

3. X-Pac vs. Double J Hair vs Hair Match

THIS MATCH IS ONE OF THE LONGEST NON-TITLE MATCHES I'VE EVER SEEN! But unlike long, drug on matches, it was actually pretty good. There were a couple times were I doubted X-Pac, but he really loved his hair. I mean getting slammed nuts first into the ringpost would really take it out of somebody. None of these people would give up, though. The match finally ended when Southern Justice (Double J's team) came out with his guitar and while one member distracted the ref the other tried to hit X-Pac with the guitar. X-Pac outsmarted them and instead he took the guitar and hit Double J for the three count. After an embarrassing haircut by X-Pac, Double J left.

Winner X-Pac Pinfall Rating: 6/10

Pretty good X-Pac match

4. Sable and Mystery Partner vs. Marc Mero and Jacqueline

This match started with Marc and Jackie coming out and then announcing that her partner was a then unknown Edge. The match doesn't need much explaining, but the ending was good. Edge threw Sable into Marc Mero for the pin.

Winner Sable and Edge Pinfall Rating: 6/10

O.K match with some high flying moves and a spanking.

5. Ken Shamrock vs. Owen Wilson Lion's Den Match

This match is one of my top ten favorite matches because of how technical both of these men were and how brutal the match was. Also cause I'm Irish like him. The Lion's Den is a mini elimination chamber where they stuff two guys in a octagon steel cage where they can't get out and have to win by pinning their opponent or making them tap. This match makes a Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho technical match look wimpy. Throughout the entire match they're choking each other out and trying to break their bones. By the end they are both bleeding and battered. You also get to see some Matrix-like jumps off the sides of the cage. The match ends with Shamrock snapping Owen's ankle.

Winner Ken Shamrock Submission Rating: 9/10

Now before we go onto the next match I have one thing to say: Unlike what the box says it isn't Kane & Mankind vs. New Age Outlaws. It ends up Mankind vs. New Age Outlaws in a anything goes match.

6. Mankind vs. New Age Outlaws Tag Team Championchip

Pathetic and horrible. The match was good but I was describing Mankind in that match. I felt so sorry for him during the match because it was horribly, horribly one sided. Road Dogg was funny with the Mic, and thank God the match was short!! But no, afterwords they threw him in a dumpster and Kane appeared slamming a slegehammer into Mankind's face.

Winner and new ""Tag Team Champions of the World! The Road Dogg Jessie James, the bad @$$ Billy Gunn, the New Age Outlaws! Pin

Rating: 6/10

Good job by the NAO, and hat's off to Mankind for trying.

6. The Rock vs. Triple H Ladder Match for the IC Championchip

This match seemed handicapped because of Rock hitting Triple H in the knee snapping a tendant, but he wouldn't go without a fight. It starts with another musical performance by the people who do the DX theme song. Then the match starts with them dishing out heavy blows to each other. After a while they brought in ladders and the pain started. This is my favorite singles Ladder Match because of it's brutality on each of the wrestlers. There were some gut-wrenching falls and slamms onto the ladders and some chair to ladder hits that I think could have broken Triple H's knee. Right now I hate Triple H, but back then I really liked him, especially in this match. By the end Mark ""Dark Chocolate"" Henry had thrown powder in Triple H's eyes blinding him. After some blinded stumbles he got on the ladder. Rock regained consiousnous and started to climb to the top. Oce they both reached the top they exchanged blows until Chyna interferred and really nailed Rocky in nuts. Triple H capatilized on the opportunity and won the match. DX was 3 for 3, and Triple H won blinded and with a bad knee!

Winner and New IC Champion Triple H Pinfall Rating: 9/10

7. Stone Cold vs. the Undertaker for the Championchip

This match had some pretty cool moves like Taker's leg drop from the turnbuckle to the announce table, and of course the Stunner, but it was predictable.

Winner and Still Champion Stone Cold Pinfall

European Title: D'Lo Brown v.s. Val Venis
Sure it doesn't really look exciting on paper, but the match itself is surprisingly good. Both men execute nice moves, but it ends in an unfortunate disqualification. After the match, Val even gives the Money Shot to the referee. ***
Handicap Match: Kaientai v.s. Oddities
This match is surprisingly better than it sounds. This a four-on-three handicap match with Kaientai getting their butt kicked throughout most of the match. The match is actually pretty funny too, even though the Oddities are complete idiots. **3/4
Hair v.s. Hair Match: X-Pac v.s. Jeff Jarrett
Just in case you don't know, this is back when Jeff Jarrett's hair was pretty long and not short like it is today. This is a very good match from both men. The ending was a little cheap, but entertaining anyway. ***1/2
Sable & Edge v.s. Marc Mero & Jacquelyn
Yep, even though this match doesn't sound too exciting, it is also very good. The most notable part of the match is when Edge does his incredible no-hands-over-the-top-rope dive onto Mero. Good match. **3/4
Lion's Den Match: Ken Shamrock v.s. Owen Hart
One of the best matches on the entire card is this one right here. Daresay maybe the best Lion's Den Match ever. Both men perform awesome moves off the cage and do great counters out of each other's submission holds. Awesome match. ****
Tag Team Title: New Age Outlaws v.s. Mankind & Kane
Well Kane was supposed to be in this match, but for some reason, he no-showed leaving Mankind to take on the Outlaws by himself. Mankind actually does a pretty good job with the Outlaws, but numbers eventually get to Mankind and he winds up losing the tag straps. Could have been better even it was an actual tag team match like it was supposed to, but it wasn't too bad for what it was. **
Ladder Match/Intercontinental Title: The Rock v.s. Triple H
Probably the best match on the card and one of the best ladder matches ever. The Rock and HHH give it their all in this awesome contest which was just the start of what was to come in their epic battles of 2000. Awesome, awesome match. *****
WWF Title: Steve Austin v.s. The Undertaker
Great main event match right here. Maybe the best out of all the Undertaker/Austin encounters. The best and coolest spot of the entire match was Undertaker delivering a leg drop to Austin from the top turnbuckle to the outside onto (not through this time) the Spanish announce table. Awesome spot, great match. ****3/4
Overall, this is without a doubt one of the best SummerSlam's there has ever been. A great Pay-Per-View top to bottom.",1042675200,12,2801,4.66060606060606
933344,4,6304826214,"This ppv was one to remember, even if the main event wasn't that good, u can remember the main event cause it was hyped up so much.  Let's get to the matches(includes spoilers).
D'lo vs Val Venis Euro title.  Great match, lots of great stuff and high risks.  Val Venis even takes D'lo's chest protector and tries to use it with the Money Shot.  Val pushes the ref down and the ref DQ's him.  At least Val hits the money shot on ref, even tho we wanted it on D'lo.(outta)
Handicap match: Oddities and Silva w/ Luna and ICP vs Kaientai
This match was pretty boring. The quadrupel chokeslam, all three oddities chokeslamin all four of kaientai at the same time, really made up for it.
Hair vs Hair: Double J vs X-Pac.  Pretty good match.  X-pac wins and soon the Headbangers, Road Dogg and more hold Double J down as he gets his hair cut.
Mixed Tag match: Sable/Edge vs Jaqueline/Marc Mero.  This match was ok, but nothin too special.  The only thing i liked seeing, besides Sable, was Edge doing the Downward Spiral again, and his body splash over the ropes onto Marc Mero when he(Edge) got the tag.  ...
Lion's Den Match: Ken Shamrock vs Owen Hart.  Either that or the ladder match stole the show in my view.  Great match, they pulled off some unbelieveable stuff in that cage.  ... I think Owen's manager, forgot his name, but is Shamrock's enemy, was suppose to throw in the towel but he just walked away.  ...
WWF tag title match: Mankind and Kane vs Billy gunn and Road dogg.  It actually becomes a hardcore match or already was one.  Kane never shows up until later.  ...
Ladder match for IC title:  The Rock with Henry vs HHH with Chyna.  This was a great ladder match.  It wasn't the best like RVD vs Eddie Guerrero but great nonetheless.  HHH was the good guy and Rock the bad guy.  Mark threw powder in HHH's face but Chyna fought him off.  Later it seemed like Rock had the match won as he was climbin the ladder with HHH on the other side of the ladder, ...
 Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Undertaker.  Dang i was wantin to see this match so bad, cause it was two of the greatest at the time finally fightin, but it turned out to be a [bad] match.  I was really rootin for The Undertaker, my favorite wrestler back than and still is.  Undertaker hits a leg drop off the turnbuckle onto Stone Cold thru the announce table, altho the table did not break which made the leg drop look [bad] to most ppl.  Anyways, Taker goes for his Old School walk on the ropes, and when he comes off Stone Cold hits a low blow....

In my opinion, this was the best match that The Rock & HHH have ever had with one another. Both men took a ton of nasty bumps, endured a lot of punishment, and paid the price to make this matchup a true classic. The Undertaker took on S.C. Steve Austin in the main event for the WWE title. This match was also a classic. The Undertaker & Austin waged on heck of a war, beating the holy heck out of each other. The best part was when ""The Dead Man"" leaped off the top turnbuckle and legdropped Steve Austin through the Spanish announce table! That was just unbelieveable!

I was particularly happy that the match had this result. The Handicap match was a waste of my time, and the appearance by The Insane Clown Posse was the second worst thing about any of the 1998 pay per views.  The Oddities were the most out of place part of the Attitude era. The X-Pac/Jarrett was good. The Mixed tag match was another waste of time.  The Lions Den match between shamrock and Owen Hart was good, but would have been better in a steel cage... why not???  The tag team title match was great.  Mankind took on the New age Outlaws.

7878102,5,6304826214,"1.) WWF European Championship Match: Val Venis vs D'Lo Brown (c)

Opening match of the night starts off slow with little to no response from the crowd. Venis and D'Lo manage to pick up the pace midway through and put on a decent back and forth bout. This one lasted nearly 15 minutes. The match gets a controversial ending when Venis takes of D'Lo's chest protector, puts it on himself and attempted to do the Money Shot on D'Lo. However, the referee stops him and accidentally crotches Venis on the turnbuckle in the process. Venis angered by this, shoves the referee down, leading to a DQ with D'Lo retaining the title

2.) The Oddities w/ICP and Luna vs Kaientai w/Yamaguchi San

Nothing more than a comedy match. Nothing more, nothing less. The Oddities win

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Hair vs Hair Match: Jeff Jarrett w/Southern Justice vs X-Pac wHoward Finkel

Jarrett shaved The Fink's head earlier that night on Sunday Night Heat and accompanied X-Pac to the ring for the match, decked out in a DX shirt and looking ridiculous in it as well. Southern Justice are sent to the back and the match is underway. Pretty good match from these two with some brilliant wrestling displayed in this one. Southern Justice comes back out to try and help Jarrett near the end and while the referee's back is turned; X-Pac nails Jarrett with a guitar and gets the pinfall win. The Headbangers and Droz came to the ring following the match to ensure that Jarrett didn't escape. The post-match shenanigans were hilarious as Jarrett argues with referee Mike Chioda about getting hit with the guitar as his blonde locks are snipped away

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Marc Mero and Jacqueline vs Sable and Edge

Not too bad but noting special. Sable had a mystery partner and it wasn't revealed to be Edge until the match was about to begin. Match could've been better but it is what it is. Edge throws Sable on top of Mero and Sable gets the win over Mero, making him look like a fool once more.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Lion's Den Match: Owen Hart vs Ken Shamrock

This was more of a UFC like match then your ordinary wrestling match as this match took place inside of an octagon like structure, similar to UFC. Owen and Shamrock also offered up a nice blend of pro-wrestling and MMA style maneuvers throughout the duration. Funny part of the match where J.R. calls Owen a nugget which was absolutely comical to hear J.R. say. Shamrock wins with an ankle lock on Owen to end this one. This would unfortunately mark Owen's last SummerSlam event he'd appear at.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Mankind (c) vs The New Age Outlaws

Originally supposed to be a Tag Team Championship Match with Mankind and Kane defending the titles against The Outlaws became a Handicap Match for the titles as it was announced earlier in the night that Kane refused to compete and would not be participating in the title match. So once again, Mankind would be playing the role of the sympathetic heel in this one. The Outlaws take us back to Wrestlemania 14 as they roll a dumpster out to ringside--planning to toss Mankind inside of it. This match was a short but exciting one as this was pretty much a Hardcore Handicap Tag Team Championship match. Quite a few weapons came into play in this one. This match portrays Mankind in typical fashion as he refuses to stay down for even the most brutal attacks. A spike piledriver on the belt spells the end of Mankind and his Tag Team Championship reign as we have new Tag Team Champions. In a complete heel tactic by The Outlaws (who were a fan favorite team at the time); Billy Gunn and Road Dogg toss Foley inside of the dumpster. As The Outlaws celebrate, Kane suddenly busts out of the dumpster and scrambles Foley's brains with a sledgehammer and Jim Ross is pissed after witnessing it.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Triple H w/Chyna vs The Rock (c)

Without a doubt a classic in my book. Triple H and The Rock absolutely tore the house down in this one and could even be considered their best match against each other. Triple H wins this amazing bout but unfortunately his reign as Intercontinental Champion was a cup of coffee as he'd relinquish the title shortly after due to a legitimate knee injury he suffered during this match. The chemistry between these two was extraordinarily untouchable! In my opinion this was the match that solidified The Rock and HHH both as soon to be main event stars as they both headed to the main event not too long after this PPV. It'd be another 2 years before a SummerSlam Ladder Match was able to compete with the caliber of this one

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) WWF Championship Match: The Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)

It what may very well have been the greatest build-up for a WWF PPV match in 1998; Stone Cold Steve Austin and Undertaker stomped to the ring in MSG ready to battle for the WWF Championship in what was dubbed ""The Highway To Hell"". This match starts off early with some surprisingly technical wrestling exchanged between the two before settling into their more familiar brawling ways. The crowd was split down the middle; cheering for both Austin and Undertaker. We see an appearance from Kane but Undertaker orders his brother to the back and The Rattlesnake and the Lord of Darkness fight for themselves. After a near 20 minute amazing back and forth fight from 2 of the Attitude Era's best; when the smoke cleared, Stone Cold Steve Austin stood tall as still WWF Champion. Considering how often WWF relied on interferences in main events back in the Attitude Era; it was a smart move to allow Taker and Austin to have this match to themselves with no Kane and/or McMahon interferences that would've possibly otherwise tarnished the credibility of this match. A great SummerSlam main event and my favorite SummerSlam main event at that. With that being said, this is probably the best match Taker and Austin had against each other. Their Cold Day In Hell match comes in at a close second.

Overall: Amazing SummerSlam PPV! The build-up was great and every fan that witnessed this PPV live at MSG when this happened is lucky no doubt. Despite a poor comedy match with The Oddities and a decent Lion's Den Match, it's not enough to take away anything from this PPV. The Ladder Match was a great edition for the PPV to end the HHH/Rock feud for the time being and to follow that up with an amazing, psychological match between Undertaker and Steve Austin and you've got yourself a grade A PPV. On the number scale, SummerSlam 1998 gets a 9, but on Amazon, it deserves nothing less of a 5/5 stars",1409529600,,7227,5.184549356223176
7878103,4,6304826214,"Summerslam 1998 was the Highway to Hell for Stone Cold and the Undertaker for the WWE title. This rivalry was building up for months and this match finally took place right here in the Garden. Another big time match that took place here was the epic ladder match between Triple h and The Rock. This Summerslam was probably the most hyped one up to this point in time.

1. European Title
Val Venis vs. D'Lo Brown
This match was a very good opener. These two had a pretty good match up. D'Lo at this time was wearing his phony chest protector which came into play many times. A good match which ended in a dq but it did had some good reversals and moves used. 3.5/5

2. Kaientai vs. The Oddities
Nothing really great or exciting at all but some good quality entertainment. It was fun to watch the little guys from Kaientai fight the bigger and taller guys from the Oddities. Nothing great by any means but very entertaining and fun. 2/5

3. Hair Match- Jeff Jarrett vs. X-Pac
A pretty refreshing match, least from a wrestling stand point. These two was pretty much on point in this match and pulling off good counters and getting in some shots on each other. They have had better but this is a match that belongs here. Good match up. 3.75/5

4. Edge & Sable vs. Marc Mero & Jacqueline
I believe this was edges's ppv debut. Edge was very on key here and showing everyone what he is made of. He pulled off an impressive dive over the top rope onto mero. Sable and Edge was working very well together and doing double teamed moves. A good ppv debut for Edge. 3.5/5

5. Lion's Den Match- Owen Hart vs. Ken Shamrock
A very unique match here. They were placed in this circle ring with no ropes surrounded by like a 12 ft high cage. Hart and Shamrock were going for submissions all through the match. Hart took a few hard shots from Shamrock here. I felt this match could have been better with what both of these guys are capable of but they still gave us something good to watch. 3.5/5

6. Tag Team Titles
No Holds Barred & Pin Falls Count Anywhere
Mankind vs. New Age Outlaws
It was supposed to be Mankind & Kane but Kane didn't show up. Mankind was at his usual routine here taking his hard chair shots to the head and the hard slams onto the floor. Mankind really takes a beating, getting in very little offense here and there. Nothing we haven't already seen from Foley before. Kane does make an appearence after the match anyhow. 4/5

6. Intercontinental Title
Ladder Match- The Rock vs. Triple H
This is another match that had a lot of build up to. After their match at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-In-Your-House-23-Fully-Loaded/dp/6305085471/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE In Your House 23 - Fully Loaded</a>&nbsp;solved nothing, Rock and Triple H upped their game here in this tremendous ladder match to end their feud. Both Hunter and Rock took a lot of hard punishment from the ladder and from each other. A lot of the action takes place on the outside where both took some viscious bumps on the ladder. Rock trys to work on Hunter's knee here and there. The fans was very electric in this one. The action in the ring was also very good. This was great match which stole the show. Outstanding match. This match is also available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-The-Ladder-Match/dp/B000LC3IJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - The Ladder Match</a>. A showstopping match. 5/5

7. WWE Title
Undertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
A perfect main event to close out the show. This match had a lot of hype behind it and Austin & Taker left it all on the line in this one. Taker was really out brawling Austin here and giving strikes after strikes and just using his strength to wear down Stone Cold. Austin was able to produce and pull out moveneuvers Austin rarely uses to counter and try to beat down Taker. The action would get taken to the outside where Taker would drop a massive leg drop to Austin while on the announce table. A pretty good counter from Austin into the stunner for the finish. A great main event. 5/5

This is one I recommend basically for the last two matches. But don't spend too much on it though.",1222732800,,4218,4.7046070460704605
7878104,5,6304826214,"My WWF fever continues with the 1998 edition of SummerSlam. This event was highlighted by one of the most anticipated main events in SummerSlam history as the ""Highway To Hell"" concludes with WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin battling The Undertaker. In fact, this was one of those SummerSlam cards that didn't have a bad match & was a solid card from top to bottom but I feel that most fans will remember this event for two young athletes stealing the show.

WWF European Champion D'Lo Brown vs Val Venis. This was the first surprise of the night as these two went all out to put on a great opening contest. This was one of both's men best matches in their WWF career as they put on a great back & forth contest while delivering a better performance than anyone else expected to the point that even the ending didn't take away from this solid encounter.

The Oddities vs Kaientai. Before the match, the Insane Clown Posse put on a performance by singing the Oddities' theme song that even got the attention of many hot looking women at ringside. This was a 4 on 3 handicap match that actually came off as a comedic match more than just a filler as the Oddities had fun at the expense of Kaientai due to their size advantage with Luna & Kaientai's manager getting involved as well.

Hair vs Hair Match: X-Pac vs Jeff Jarrett. For those that remember their history knows that this feud goes way back to '95 to when Sean Waltman was under the ""1-2-3 Kid"" gimmick. It should also be noted that Jarrett & Southern Justice shaved Howard Finkle's hair earlier in the night that lead to him being in X-Pac's corner. Anyways, this was a good back & forth contest between these two with the real highlight being the aftermath where Jarrett getting his hair cut with help from the New Age Outlaws, Headbangers, Droz & even Howard Finkle.

Sable & Edge vs Marc Mero & Jacqueline. Sable's mystery partner turned out to be the newcomer in Edge. This match was similar to the mixed tag team match from WrestleMania except this time, Sable & Mero are on opposites team. And just like that match, this was a better match than anyone anticipated as Edge & Mero worked well together while Sable once again showed some nice moves including performing the TKO to Jacqueline & her double-team move with Edge to win the match.

Lion's Den Match: Ken Shamrock vs Owen Hart. This was a unique concept for this time as this heavily resembled a mixed martial arts contest as they competed in an 8 foot pit similar to a UFC octagon with the rules being that you have to win by submission. This was a stiff match with both men pulling off various submission holds & even delivering impactful moves within the cage with Shamrock pulling off a few moves off the cage. Again, a very unique but great match for it's type of style.

Hardcore Rules: WWF Tag Team Champions Kane & Mankind vs New Age Outlaws. Don't let the title fool as Mankind actually faced the Outlaws on his own while Kane just made an appearance at the end of the match much to the surprise of everyone involved. This match had it's moments of hardcore action with Mankind taking his sick bumps like his heading bouncing off the dumpster, taking stiff head shots with weapons & even being powerbombed through two steel chairs along with Billy Gunn taking a sick table spot.

Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs Triple H. The leader of the Nation battles the leader of the DX & quite frankly this was the match that stole the show that began a true launching pad for both men's career. They told a great story here with HHH selling his knee injury from Rock attacking it on Heat earlier in the night while Rock was very aggressive here with his attack to the point that you thought he was trying to literally break the leg including using another ladder & bringing in a steel chair. With cameos from Mark Henry & Chyna's role playing a factor in the end, this match was exactly what Jim Ross stated afterwards ""one of the most outstanding matches not just ladder matches"".

WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Undertaker. After months of build up, the Highway To Hell has finally reached it's point of no return. Out of all their matches together, this was their best ""wrestling"" match as these two put an awesome performance with Taker being very aggressive throughout & even at one point executing a sick looking leg drop from the top turnbuckle through the Spanish Announce table that left Austin spitting out blood afterwards. Other than a brief moment where Austin & Taker clash heads that actually knocked Austin out in the beginning, this match lived up to the hype & was without a doubt one of their best matches together with a surprise mutual show of respect to the winner at the end.

Overall, this event is worth the price of admission & shows clearly why most fans consider the Attitude Era the most successful run in the company's history as this was one of the best SummerSlams of all time & an event I highly recommend.",1208908800,,4998,4.5506117908787544

It started with Max Mini and Spike Dudley taking on King Kong Bundy and Yokozuna. Spike and Max got flattened from the start of the match. Spike was renamed,Mr.pancake and Max was killed and reincarnated as Mikey Whipwreck.
The U.S title was next. Chris Beniot defended it against Kamala in a 2 out of 3 falls match. Benoit got fall 1 and Kamala got fall 2, but in the end,Benoit won by DQ because Kamala was really Spider-man in disguise. Also,because Benoit went blind in the match,he was stripped of the U.S belt and it was rewarded to Brother Love.
Then, Giant Gonzalez took on Road Dogg in a""lozer eats his shoes"" match. After the pumphandle,Road Dogg seemed to had the victory,but then was tackled by a yak,and then out of nowhere,RVD came and pinned Gonzales for the win and won ownership of Venus, where Van Dam was named,""king of the pirates"".
After that was the handicap tag title match. L.O.D took on the Steiners and The Grand Wizard,and the whole match took place on Mt. Everist. The Wizard won the belts by himself when he pushed both teams off Everist(which was the stipulation).However,he lost the belts 24 hours later when Wizard quit the buisness to be a candle maker with a empire that spread throughout america.
Then,there was a dance contest between Nathan Jones,Carlito,and Eugene for the Intercontinental belt. Eugene won after he brokedance his opponents into submission. In fact,Carlito is now recouperating at Atlantis.
The next match was a 6-pac challenge for the Cruiserweight championship. It was Ultimo Dragon v. Matt Hardy v. Billy Kidman v. Zach Gowan v. Paul London v. Rey Mysterio. In a strange turn of events that will never be explained,PaRappa the Rapper became the new cruiserweight champion when he pinned Spongebob Squarepants,which made his fellow nWo Wolfpac members proud. PaRappa would then be shocked to discover that Zach Gowan was his long lost brother.
Up next was the long awaited Double trouble match. Kevin Nash,Scott Hall, and Owen Hart took on Diesil,Razor Ramon,and the Blue Blazer inside the Hell in a cell. People were flying off the cell,dropped through the cell,and even electricuted. Nash would eventually pin Diesil but since Diesil was also known as Kevin Nash,they both lost and the match was a No Contest.
Now,for the main event. A tag match for the WWE title. Stone Cold, The Rock,AJ Styles,and Sean O'Haire, v. Goldberg, Randy Orton, Derek Jeter,and Doink the Clown v. The n. W.o.(Hollywood Hogan,Shawn Michaels,Abyss,and Tajiri)along with their manager,Bananaman!,and Earthquake and The Undertaker were special guest referes. Team Stone Cold would win the tag match and then the team battled each other for the title. In the end,for some strange reason,Batista was declared the new WWE champion even though he was not in the match. Then we found out it was because he beat Lex Luger on Velocity last night,and that was another stipulation to win the title.
Well,that does it for me. Smell ya later.
