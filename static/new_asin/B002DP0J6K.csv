3912346,2,B002DP0J6K,"Here you have two of the most beautiful and awesome places on the planet, and the people responsible for this Blu-ray go out of their way to make the least of it all. Rather than show viewers just how spectacular Zion and Bryce are with loving, lingering shots of the natural wonders, they litter frame after frame with gaudily garbed tourists rock climbing, tubing, biking, mule riding and stuffing their faces. To make matters still worse, the cameraman is enamored of fast pans and zooms which, aside from making the subject matter difficult to appreciate, also accentuate lens distortion. Then the editor, possibly inspired by Jason Bourne fight sequences, jumps from scene to scene as if she has something to hide.

As far as the narration goes, the writing is hackneyed bordering on inane and the delivery breathless and gushing with insincerity. The score is adequate.

Such is their pride in this film, the production team doesn't bother listing their individual names on either the packaging or in any opening credits. However, I believe certain key people deserve to be recognized for this lamentable under-achievement: the writers are Janet Russo and Lex Gillespie, the DOP is Greg Gricus, the editor Eve Saxon, and David Michael Gee does the narration.

Bonus Program: Secrets of the Southwest
Thanks to dropping one writer and changing the DOP and editor, this historical segment ain't half bad. Subjects featured along Route 66 and the Grand Circle include Monument Valley, Gallup, Winslow, the Grand Canyon, Lake Powell, the Goosenecks, a Navajo reservation (Canyon de Chelly and Hubbell Trading Post), the Painted Desert/Petrified Forest, El Malpais Lava Field, Rock Art Ranch, llamas, Santa Fe, Georgia O'Keeffe/Ghost Ranch, Loretto Chapel and Chimayo. (Blu-ray is a waste.)",1328659200,8,1791,5.211805555555555

3912348,5,B002DP0J6K,"Having recently visited both Zion and Bryce National Parks-this Blu-Ray qualifies as the next best thing to actually being there.  The picture quality is outstanding and goes a long way to showcase the natural beauty of both parks.  Bryce Canyon's colorful hoodoos look especially breathtaking in hi-def.

Another reviewer criticized the fact that a large portion of the video is dedicated to things like hiking gear, etc. and I would agree with this criticism.  I would've rather they spent that time highlighting the beauty of the parks and the various hot spots in more detail.  After all, the hi-def visuals are what make Blu-Ray the preferred format for this type of program and info on hiking gear is not what the typical viewer paid to see.

A nice included bonus on this Blu-Ray though is ""Secrets of the Southwest"".  Being very partial to the Southwest in general (the most beautiful part of our country in my opinion) I was pleased to see it showcased in such detail and with such reverence.  Not only did they cover popular locales such as the Grand Canyon-but also showcased other, less widely known places of interest off the beaten path.  The lengthy ""Secrets of the Southwest"" bonus program alone was worth the price of the Blu-Ray.",1262736000,8,1247,4.84433962264151
3912349,3,B002DP0J6K,"The Blu Ray has a good overview on Zion and Bryce. I really enjoyed the fly overs and also the close ups inside the parks. They give a good description of the park highlights and are very informative. I was also happy with the picture quality. It was crisp and clear and looked amazing in Blu Ray.

I am only giving three stars because there is an issue with the audio. The narrator sounds fine but the sounds gets very quiet when they have an interview. It sounds like they are far away from the sound recorder. This may be an issue with my setup but this Blu Ray is the only one with issues.

If you love the national parks and want to get a good overview, then pick up this Blu Ray.",1255737600,,685,4.104477611940299
3912350,1,B002DP0J6K,"This turns out to be a dvd which emphasizes activities like rock climbing (who cares) over the beauty of these two beautiful parks. There is non-stop chirpy narration from a guy who's voice you will recognize immediately from programs on cable nature/travel channels.

The camera moves with lightning speed over the scenery, but dwells on things like sneakers.

Finally, if this is blu-ray, its the worst quality I've ever seen.

All-in-all, a real disappointment.",1254960000,37,464,5.243243243243243
