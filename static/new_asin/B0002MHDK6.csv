Reiji Oozora, a lazy high school student, is haunted by the same nightmare every night. A burning world surrounds a cloaked figure as the huge figure of a dragon looms over it. The figure pushes back the hood, revealing a girl crying. ""Somebody help us."" she repeats over and over, leaving Reijii shocked as he wakes up.

Known as the ""tardy champion"" at his school, the other main characters are introduced: Maiko Yukino his best friend and his current rival, Daisuke. Maiko drags him to a building after school, introducing to he vass virtual reality game known ws Dragon Drive and from there, the plot thickens.

Bandai's director for this anime series, Toshifumi Kawase, came up with a cool idea if your into the whole virtual reality or dragons. This anime was aimed at kids and young teens but adults can enjoy the humor too. With his cute dragon, Chibii, their is always constant humor and also good lessons of loyalty and friendship presented in the anime.

Besides the opening and closing themes presented in the shows, the music could of been much better. The animation however is not bad at all. The series presents a good story, follows it through, and does not ease up on the laughter at all. Currently on volume 8, being released this month, ten volumes have been annouced out.

Buy or don't buy, the choice is in the end entirley up to the buyer. I would however recommend this for the kiddies if you have any.",1117756800,,1639,4.7368421052631575
