8453958,5,B0052IBFKY,"If you love old cereal commercials, this DVDs for you. It's chock full of Post cereal commercials (I guess Kellogg's and General Mills will be follow up volumes). There are plenty of jingles, animation, celebrities, box prizes, and mascots to go around. There's Linus the Lion for Animals Cereal, Cracko the Bird for Crackos, The Honeycomb Kid. Celebrities include Van Johnson, Don Knotts (and Aunt Bee) and even that Indian that used to cry in that pollution commercial. I like the animated ads the best. Oh, it's all so very Saturday morning!",1307059200,5,544,4.923913043478261
