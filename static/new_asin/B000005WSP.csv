A twisting and turning plot with superb actors playing hysterically written roles.  Easy to follow, yet makes you  think.  Great for all ages and personalities.

Its an ambitious film to sustain the slapstick. Who tried to analysis Laurel and Hardy? Trying to push a piano across a wooden swinging bridge suddenly confronted with a guy in a gorilla suit hits you at a place in the brain that defies analysis.

Usually the cousins will get together and go crazy bouncing from 1 thing to the next, but they all stayed in the family room the whole time for this, and kept quiet.

With the four aspects of the character often experiencing blatant situations associated with many secret hermetic cults, one has to mark it all as being coincidental and that the writers were at most indirectly commenting on the reality of situations that one can perceive, if you aren't aware (stupid or ignorant) of the meta puzzle.",1306281600,,608,4.912621359223301
1189242,5,B000005WSP,"People wonder what happened to director John Landis after his heyday in the Eighties.  In the Nineties he was making terrific films this one included that either nobody bothered to see or were mishandled by the marketing departments of their studios.  Before ""The Stupids"" Landis made a terrific screwball comedy send-up with Sylvester Stallone, ""Oscar"", and a great vampire flick, ""Innocent Blood"".  This is a terrific foray for Landis into the land of family filmmaking even though I thought the subplot involving international arms dealing may be a little intense for the tots.  The Stupid family isn't so much dumb as incredibly thick.  How anybody can concoct a plot to steal garbage and see something nefarious in undeliverable mail is downright inspired.  The Stupid family may be incredibly oblivious but the film is smart.  If it weren't the whole endeavor would go up in flames. It also helps that the Stupid family(Tom Arnold, Jessica Lundy, Bug Hall, and Alex McKenna) are impeccably cast and believable as a unit.  Terrific cameos by Jenny McCarthy and Bob Keeshan(Captain Kangaroo).  I remember this film being dumped into the marketplace over the Labor Day holiday in 1996.

I showed it to my 7th grade class and they enjoyed it and ""got"" most of the jokes.  Don't expect an intellectual movie...sit back and have a good laugh.",1278115200,3,327,4.416666666666667
1189256,2,B000005WSP,"The Stupids...is the family really as stupid as the film wanted me to believe?  In hopes that I could be more forgiving with the film because it's apt?  I like to make a brief analysis.

Throughout ""The Stupids"", I saw the Stupid family dumbstrucked over their trash being stolen week after week, writing down basic words that would easily confuse a Stupid member when reading it, mishandling foods, pretending they're bushes until they actually think they are, believing their bikes got stolen when they're chained to a bus, going to a planetarium and think it's heaven and a janitor is Our Creator, and so forth.  Their actions indicate them as dimwits, but for dimwits, they sure are otherwise well-adjusted. The Stupid parents know how to drive a car and the Stupid children know how to ride a bike, they understand directions to where they wanted to go, speak eloquently, are aware about current technology, kept their house in place even if does look tacky, and know how to dress themselves properly; heck, the parents must knew how to 'get busy' if they have children.  For such a functional family to do idiotic things whenever a situation is given to them, I had to come to a conclusion that they're not stupid.  They're silly...or misguided anarchists, given the amount of zany damage they caused.

I am rather astounded that big complain with ""The Stupids"" is that the family is not stupid enough, or rather I don't find their stupidity to be believable.  Genuinely stupid people are slow, basic and barely function as human begins; Forrest Gump is a likable example, and heck, Patrick Starfish is more believably stupid than The Stupids, and he's a sea creature.  The Stupids' antics are more childish and inane, which makes them unbearably not funny.  In fact, the real stupid people aren't The Stupids themselves but rather the people around them.  Characters that eat up their antics and following their vague assumptions without a single thought or reason, especially that one random scene where an audience is prancing to ""I'm My Own Grandpa"" by Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold), which is very haunting; the only 'smart' person of the movie is the postal manager who fired Stanley from his old job, but who was the one that hired him the first place, huh?  The villains are a big culprit of this incompetent circus as they follow all the worse cliches in the book, such as revealing their plans and making big speeches instead of shooting people.  To understand their purpose, the dimwitted convenient plot deals with Stanley being involved in a black market deal by an Army superior, thinkin' it has something to do with the conspiracy of his trash being stolen, and of course it leads up to his family inadvertently saving the---blah, if I want wanted to see idiots get caught in a terrorist plot without their understand, I'd see ""Beavis and Butthead Do America"".

The bad guys try to kill Stanley, but he unknowingly overcame with dumb luck and ridiculous circumstances, such as car bomb that somehow explodes everything but the area where the character is.  It's like I'm watching a cartoon; heck, it even had stop-animation pets and aliens who planed to destroy the family.  What the heck am I watching?  The humor's just too goofy and pasteurized for any given adult, and I hate the running gag where the family stared at the audience and made kooky one-liners; that has never been a good gag.  I doubt even kids would find this funny, as there's just too much witty retorts for them to understand, and not much in the way of zany physical antics.  The only good thing this movie had going for itself is an imagination scene with Christopher Lee burning letters and stealing trash, if only because his theatrical acting actual made a dumb scene cool; two minutes out of a 94-minute waste of time.

I could recommend good stupid movies, but I don't think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/these/dp/B0009IOR5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">these</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/films/dp/B000K7VHOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">films</a>&nbsp;would cater to the 'family-friendly' audience.

(I have to admit I never thought it was necessary to ""understand"" slapstick, but judging by some reviews I've seen, lots of people don't.)  The so-called ""bad"" acting is intentional (in fact, it's sometimes quite good bad acting), and yes, the characters are supposed to be stupid.  The humour comes from the dissociation between our ""normal"" view of the world and their continual misinterpretations of everything that happens to them, and the way that ""reality"" somehow always seems to support their misinterpretations.  Making a truly silly comedy takes a lot of brains, and there are definitely some brains operating behind the scenes in this movie.  Sure, it's not the greatest movie in history, and it does have a few lame gags, but what comedy doesn't?  It's still a lot of fun.  And it should be given an award for reviving that immortal ode, ""I'm My Own Grandpa.""",1144108800,5,990,5.0
1189268,5,B000005WSP,"I have to admit I was pretty skeptical about this one-- it looked, well, stupid.  And it starts out that way, with just what you'd expect from a young children's comedy-- a family dressed in hideous clothes who are so dumb they take their fish for a walk and search under sofa cushions for missing family members.

But keep watching!  A plot develops, slowly transforming the movie into a James-Bond-parody-style film which might even be said to rival the ""Austin Powers"" films (especially if, like me, you find yourself wishing those films had a few more witticisms and a little less toilet humor.  Ok, the whole ""Dr. Evil"" thing is hilarious, but come on, there are only so many times the word ""crap"" is actually funny, no matter how strong a Scottish accent you say it with... I realize I'm in a bit of a minority in thinking this way, but I was brought up on the ""Pink Panther"" movies, and in my mind there's just no substitute for genuine ""comedy of errors"" humor).

So the Stupids set out on a quest to uncover the Truth.  Who is the mysterious ""Mr. Sender"" (as in, the guy all those letters get returned to)?  What diabolical plot lurks in the trash-collector's van?  And what is their connection to a gang of international arms dealers?  Will the Stupids figure it out?  Of course not!... but they will manage to save the world anyways, even if they can't remember how to start their own car.

Favorite thing:  Little running jokes and clever references.  For example, a minor scene in which Mr. Stupid mistakes a janitor for God, addresses him as ""Lord"", and is told that the man's name is actually ""Lloyd"", is recalled later in the film when Mr. Stupid leaps into battle with the unforgettable cry ""Stop! In the name of the Lloyd!""  If that sort of thing makes you chuckle and roll your eyes at the same time, I guarantee you will like this film.",1118880000,9,1856,4.534534534534535

I actually saw this in a movie theater with Cari Kepner and sad to say we were the only ones there. America missed the boat with this film but I bet it's popular in Belgium. Anyhow,  I'm not a big fan of Tom Arnold but he is PERFECT in the role of Stanley Stupid! If you don't take life seriously and are able to find humor in everything, even funerals I suggest watching this film.  It's great fun for the whole family!

People who can sit down, open their minds and laugh at completely ridiculous stuff, which is exactly what this movie is.  There is no concrete plot that can be summarized in one or two sentences.  It's a series of events that manage to link together in the stupidest ways possible.  If you liked 'Kung Pow' or 'Mars Attacks' I think you'll like 'The Stupids'.",1052524800,9,506,4.516483516483516
1189293,1,B000005WSP,"Believe it or not, I have actually enjoyed Tom Arnold's uniquely ping-pong-like career.  He goes from ""True Lies"" to Fox Sports' talky sports TV show to late night guest appearances and manages to be entertaining at every turn in spite of his lack of talent (OK, marginal talent).
But that's in supporting roles, or just being his bizarre self.  He is not made to carry a movie, and in ""The Stupids"" he is asked to do just that.  It's like taking a humorous ""Budweiser: True"" commercial and stretching that moment of humor into a 90-or-so-minute film.  Just doesn't work.
The Stupids are a family, and they're not just stupid, they are CHEERFULLY stupid.  Delighted to be stupid.  Deservedly stupid.  Willfully, gloriously, hopelessly stupid.  Clueless?  These people can't even spell the word, and they'd be sure it means someone who doesn't own the ""Clue"" board game.
The movie is even more stupid.  I guess that's why there is such a wide divergence of opinion here.  If you enjoyed ""Dumb & Dumber,"" you might like ""The Stupids.""  If not (and obviously I hated it), then you won't want to waste your time with a family of grinning morons who dress and act like old-time vaudevillians and '50s TV families but don't seem to know the difference between up and down.

The only good thing I can possibly say about The Stupids is that it gives me a ready answer when someone asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen is. It blew away Jurassic Park II, and that's saying something. I wish I'd seen it in the theater, just so I could have made it the first and only movie I've ever walked out on.
Note: I'm not saying it's stupid - I love stupid movies. It's just bad. All the four- and five-star reviews are obviously and pathetically from people affiliated with the wretches who made this waste of celluloid.

1189295,5,B000005WSP,"The Stupids (1996), is a wonderful and, frankly, underappreciated film. This movie should be required viewing for anyone, and everyone, who searches in vain for all of those hidden solutions to life's most haunting and persistent problems.
Although the plot is realistic enough--seemingly plucked straight out of today's headlines of Gen-X angst and grief--I was completely sold on this film's deep introspection and faith-affirming message by the time ""I'm My Own Grandpaw [sic.]"" was sung with grace and style by my distant relative, Tom Arnold.
The fact that Tom comes from the same family tree as I do can only add pride and imbue satisfaction into my often overlooked clan--good on ya, Tom! I can only hope, and pray, that Tom is an honored guest at our next family reunion. Now THAT would be an ""Arnold Surprise"" we could all truly cherish.
If nothing else, I'm happy to know that I was right--our garbage IS being stolen! Conspiracy? Yes! Are we powerless to overcome it? No!

Suffice to say, there is one scene that takes place in a deserted planetarium, involving a janitor and two members of the nominal family (who, for reasons I won't go into here, are convinced that they have died and gone to Heaven). As artificial stars wheel close overhead, a dialogue ensues between two of the Stupid family and the janitor that is simply amazing comedy. This scene is funny enough to be part of Rat Race, Top Secret or one of the Airplanes. There is also a cute cameo by Christopher Lee as the nefarious ""Mr. Sender"" (you know, the arch-foe who has a monopoly of sorts on all the world's undeliverable mail). Oh my.
This is definitely aimed at kids, and one kid I know actually felt inclined to apologize in advance for the silliness of The Stupids.
