8558162,4,B00AW27NME,"I have a child with developmental disabilities, and another on the autism spectrum.  They are heading for age 18 at a breakneck pace.  I found this movie brilliant.  Other than the joking use of the R-word (I get it, I have a sense of humor, but I just found it jarring), I loved this movie.  I especially felt for the parents when they were told their child's IQ was too high... my daughter is disqualified for many services in Illinois because her IQ is 71 instead of 69.  Really.",1437436800,,482,4.370786516853933
8558163,5,B00AW27NME,"I just LOVED this film.  I loved the non-PC directness of this family.  The most touching and profound part is Autumn's intuitive understanding of the idea of seeing and bringing out each child's unique character rather than just training the child to not bother everyone around them too much.  This seems like a profound idea for any parents,  even of children with no special needs.  Seeing the amazing person within rather than just making sure your child is manageable is so important for all parents.  When Adam's mum worries that her son could end up in jail, this really sent a chill down my spine - how many people with this kind of special needs are in prison today because society has no time, space or place to put them?  Love love love this family, love love love this film.",1403308800,,786,4.571428571428571
8558164,5,B00AW27NME,This is an amazing story about  the life and the family of a young man with Autism.  Gork should be seen by all those who work or live with a person on the spectrum.  I have never seen a documentary like this  before.,1382832000,,217,3.9767441860465116
8558165,5,B00AW27NME,"Gork is an unflinching look at the Terrill family and their multi-faceted experiences living with their adopted son/brother Adam, who has a myriad of special needs.  It's a hilarious, poignant, heart-warming, frustrating, and eye-opening experience - much like life itself.  HIGHLY recommended.  I look forward to Devon Terrill's forthcoming film, ""American Winter"".",1361664000,,366,6.0
8558166,5,B00AW27NME,"This is a very interesting depiction of a very interesting family and how the adoption of a special needs child both enriched the family's lives and help Gork achieve a level of ""normality"". The Terrills took on a challenge that most families would avoid. Watching Gork grow from a small child to an adult helps to lift the vial of mystery surrounding individuals with special needs. We can see that Gork is a full fledged human being, not diminished by his challenges, but he adjusts to ""normality"" of his life.",1361059200,,512,4.7
8558167,5,B00AW27NME,"This is a great movie! I've provided services to people with disabilities for over 20 years and this is the first movie that I've seen that I feel the community, parents, service providers should watch. It makes things real- and honest, and has fun with the frustrations, but yet brings things to light that really are important. Excellent movie- I personally want the whole world to see it. Worth every cent! :)",1360281600,2,412,4.736111111111111
8558168,5,B00AW27NME,"GORK!is an excellent production conveying the realities of raising a special, special-needs child to young adult. It is, importantly, highly reality-based and in-your-face honest. All parents who adopt or become foster parents should see it and it's a must for social workers.

You will laugh, shake your head in disbelief, cry, and laugh some more.",1359158400,3,349,5.345454545454546
