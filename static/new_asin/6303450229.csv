In this particular video, the elephant is a bit of a fool who keeps making the same mistakes over and over, but he learns his lesson eventually.

645125,1,6303450229,"Was terrible.  My kids had no interest.  My twin 3 year old boys LOVE LOVE LOVE trains. The train was barely in it.  There was 1 train song, no songs I recognized at all.  There was a stupid elephant character that got stuck on top of a roof at one point and couldn't remember how it got there, then got lost, then was sitting on top of the train.  Not remotely useful.  We try to teach toddlers NOT TO CLIMB ON THINGS - especially high things where they could get injured.  My kids watched for 20 minutes, looked puzzled the entire time, and walked out the room to go play with their toy trains. Sad.",1454457600,,601,4.173913043478261

My grandson loved the signing veggies, the cowboys and all the farm animals that sing. He laughs at the singing frog too. Cute movie. This is a DVD that is timeless, my kids loved this when they were young and now I am able to share this with my grandson. Can't wait to get more of the Wee Sing DVD's.

Although I don't recommend lots of screen time for littles, I would suggest this.  The songs are engaging, interactive and get them up and moving.  Very fun!",1397433600,2,348,4.149253731343284
645326,1,6303450229,"I bought this after reading all the great reviews and my son (2yrs old) and I both hated it.  Please don't get this!  I wish I could just give it someone so they wouldnt have to spend their money on it and be disappointed. First of the songs are not catchy enough for you to engage in or learn it.  It seems very outdated and story line is so boring.  I have the Wee sing cd's for the car and my son loves it so I thought it would have the same songs and it would have motions to go along with the songs but there are like 2 songs my son knew.  Also, our neighbors kids came over (2&3yrs) they couldn't sit through 10mins.

I bought this one, sillyville, and magical musical, and they all stink.  My mistake by getting sold by the reviews so my reivew is don't make the same mistake as I did and don't get these dvd's.",1394668800,,818,4.012345679012346

645330,5,6303450229,This Wee Sing Dvd is especially fun and provides children with lessons to be learned by working together. Some of the songs are familiar and what child doesn't love campfire songs?,1372982400,,180,4.838709677419355
645406,5,6303450229,This is great for small children.  Now that I have grandsons they are growing up to Wee Sing also.  Great for long trips with small children,1372809600,,140,4.346153846153846

645410,5,6303450229,"My kids had a couple of Wee Sing videos when they were growing up and now the tradition continues with our grandchildren. Wee Sing Train was not one of them, but our granddaughter loves trains so it was a natural choice. To be honest, the first time we played it, she didn't seem interested ( but she loved Sillyville & Wee Sing Together). Now, it's one of her favorites. You can't go wrong with any from this series. I recommend you buy more than one title so you don't have to watch the same one over & over again. Toddlers especially love these videos.",1365379200,2,555,4.346153846153846

645412,4,6303450229,Wee sing likes to put a story with songs that you knew when you were a kid.  These kids create places to explore and then take a ride on the train to explore them. Safety is mentioned and fun songs are presented.  The train talks as does the caboose.  There are fun things happening here.  I showed it to kindergartners and first graders and some liked it some did not. My kids loved it. I think it depends on how active kids are and how interested in music.  Some kids like a little at a time and come back to it.  I got this for my grandkids.,1358812800,,544,4.037383177570093
645413,5,6303450229,"Not sure how I found this, but we are a train loving household & always looking for DVD's that aren't scary/etc.  I read all the high rated reviews & decided to order & am very happy I did.  We've only had it a couple of days & they watched it several times the first day & asked for it each day after.  I conclude this is a good pick :-)  Pleasant surprise & 5 stars - highly recommend.",1354492800,,387,3.923076923076923

Kept the kids (and Mom!) entertained!",1343692800,,315,4.625
645496,5,6303450229,"For boys and girls, this video is an all-time favorite!  It acts as a story following siblings playing with their train set and toys; to a sing-along of every genre of music with fun, get up and move, interactive songs; to lessons on safety too :-).  Even adults get a kick out of watching their kids have fun with this 'movie.'  I've even gotten up and ""put my little foot right there"" many a-times:)  This is truly one of the BEST Entertaining and Interactive Kid's videos my family has ever owned.  I bought a second one when the kids wore the first one out after 6 years on playing it.  Still have it in my shelf and my kids are now in college.  And if you'd ask them about it, they'd still tell you, it was one of their favorite videos and brings back good times and fun memories.

He still remembers how much he loved it. When he was little we must have watched it at least 500 times if not more.  Later, when my other grandchildren came along they loved it just as much, therefore I just purchased two additional Wee Sing Train DVD's as gifts for our friends grandchildren.",1320624000,2,569,4.163636363636364

Of course, I purchased the VHS tape (at that time). It calmed her down; she never got tired of that video.  However, her brother is 9 years older than she is. He really got sick of that video.  He now has a young son. I talked my daughter-in-law into purchasing this video for my grandson. All of us were excited while we waited for the video to be delivered...well, except my son, who was not looking forward to listening & watching anything Wee Sing. My 15.5 mo. old grandson loves the video. He even attempts to sing some of the songs and will sway back and forth too.

Wee Sing Train begins as a girl and a boy are setting up a room with a train set with all sorts of stops along the way...a barn, farm with garden, paper dolls, & cowboys out on the range to name a few. They have a stuffed horse and elephant too. Not too long into the video, the children become part of the action as their train play area comes to life.

Now that the four of us have small children/toddlers of our own I thought it would be great to gift a DVD version this year for Christmas.

His daycare would often put a video on toward the end of the day when parents would be picking up, especially if the weather was such that they could not be outside.  He NEVER wanted to leave when this video was playing, so I ended up buying it so that he could finish watching it when we got home.  Of course, I ended up watching it too and have to admit that I enjoyed it.  One of my favorite parts is the song medley about food, especially the one about broccoli sung in opera-style.  I passed our VHS copy of this video on to my nephew for his children and plan to buy a DVD version for my niece's son too.  Maybe someday I'll have the pleasure of buying it for my own grandchildren.  I would fully expect ALL the Wee Sing videos to be equally entertaining.",1249948800,,830,4.182389937106918

Another character is the train itself, which takes the passengers from scene to scene. Its little red locomotive can talk, and it says: ""All aboard."" Most of the scenes have a western motif, and there is a scene with singing cowboys. Still another scene includes a group of children engaged in dancing.",1191801600,4,462,4.860759493670886

The other Wee Sing video's have not kept him as spellbound as this one. It has an instant calming effect on him.

645828,5,6303450229,"The Wee Sing Train is about two cute children named Casey and Carter. In the movie they're playing with a toy train and building places for it to go. Suddenly, they shrink toy size and their train talks. So Casey, Carter, and their toy elephant, Tusky, go for a ride on a train. (The train had to make trakcs because their wern't any before.) They stop at a cowboy ranch, a town with paper dolls and a sherif, and a farm. They also see two blackbirds, and princess jenny and a frog. But nearly, every time the train stops, Tusky gets hurt and has to have a note-aid. (Note shaped band-aids.) (They glowed in the dark when they went through a tunnel.) The movie teaches about thinking ""before you act."" You'll love it. Also, Does ANYBODY know when the DVDs of Wee Sing together and Grandpa's Magical Toys are going to be released. And also, The Big Rock Candy Mountains and The Marvelous Musical Mansion haven't been released on DVD yet. Even though I'm Ten, I still love this movie. Parents should get this DVD and the other wee sing DVDs for children 2-8. The Wee Sing Train is great.",1112486400,36,1085,4.43
645829,5,6303450229,"I have learned through experience that whenever buying a ""Wee Sing"" series videotape, you will get quality, wholesome songs, and pure innocence. As with the entire series, these shows lack any hint of sarcasm or rudeness on the characters behalf. There is nothing controversial here: nothing scary, no slang, no profanity, no mean-ness, no worry that some problematic topic will crop up. The children all get along with each other (as in the TV show ""Barney"") and they like each other and treat each other with respect.  The only bad thing about the entire series is that the songs tend to stick in my (adult) head and hearing some of these videos can get annoying and do suffer from a little goofiness!
Wee Sing Train is a cute story that begins with a brother and sister setting up a train layout with toy trains. They then take other toys and set up little areas (vignettes) around the track. They then suddenly shrink down (could be their imagination) and sit on the talking train and travel around the track. They stop at each ""area"" and have an experience with their toys. There are singing cowboys ""home on the range"" and it goes on and on. The songs are traditional popular American children's music, with some new Wee-Sing songs. There is even a special song that must be sung to get the train moving along the track: it is a train powered by song.
This is a very cute video that both my boys love. It has been playing in our home for over 3 years now and both children never tire of it! This is high-quality age-appropriate children's entertainment. My children began watching it when they were one year old and enjoyed it then. Both children sing these songs throughout the day, even months after seeing the video for the last time. (Hey, I need a break from it sometimes!)
There is also a board book for this Wee Sing Train, which tells a shortened version of ""The Little Engine That Could"" that comes with an audiotape. That audiotape has more songs on it and tells the story with song of ""The Little Engine That Could"". That audiotape has gotten us through some long car rides. The book is nothing remarkable.  If you child loves the Wee Sing Train be aware that Brio (used to) make a wooden train figure 8 set that has the colored Wee Sing Train track and the Wee Sing 3-car train and elephant character and if you search for a set, you may be able to find one.",1024704000,14,2376,4.497685185185185

I will say that I had a hard time sitting through it (this comes from a person who has no problem with Barney). It has grown on me though.  It's a great learning experience!  And just to let you know, I am a certified Primary Teacher.  We have since purchased two other Wee Sing video tapes and she's loves them just as much.",987206400,2,660,4.266129032258065

Sure the costumes are a bit  cartoonish and the script is a bit silly but it has great songs that are  easy for your kids to learn and even for adults it doesn't get 'old' or  stale. Of the ""wee sing"" videos that I have seen this one is the  best especially for the preschool and kindergarten age group. some of the  other ""wee Sing's"" like the magical musical mansion seem to be  aimed at a slightly older age group (1st to 3rd graders) and grow stale  quickly. ""wee signdom"" is also good for the youger age group but  my kids don't enjoy it as much, and niether do I.",966470400,4,690,4.135338345864661
