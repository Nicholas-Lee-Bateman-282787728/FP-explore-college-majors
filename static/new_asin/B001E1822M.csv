8295999,5,B001E1822M,I love this documentary. It is so well-done and interesting. Would recommend it!,1500508800,,80,5.230769230769231
8296000,4,B001E1822M,"One of the better documentaries I have seen on Einstein.  I thoroughly enjoyed the presentation and found it very informative.  I wish the History Channel would bring this DVD back into production.  (I managed to find a reasonably priced ""Used - Like New"" copy here at Amazon.)",1480896000,,277,4.851063829787234
8296001,5,B001E1822M,"The unvarnished truth . . .wonderfully done!  I like the personal and historical perspective, the zeitgeist, of what was happening in the world during his personal triumphant time!",1414886400,,180,5.428571428571429
8296002,4,B001E1822M,"Everybody knows Albert Einstein's famous equation E=mc2. Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. It showed that energy can become matter and matter can become energy. It led to the atomic bomb. Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity (1905) said space and time are the same thing, a fabric called space/time. His General Theory of Relativity (1915) redefined gravity. It showed that objects curve, bend, distort or twist the space around them. Space itself pushes planets around the sun. Photos of curved or bent starlight passing near the sun during a total solar eclipse proved Einstein correct. Light consists of particles called photons. This bio aired on the History channel.",1388275200,,693,5.252252252252252
8296003,5,B001E1822M,"I watched this first, when it was broadcast on Public Television early one lazy weekend morning, in the last decade, not planning to watch the whole thing, but it was so well done, I ended up watching it in it's entirety!  Captivating, simply superb, documentary on the life and ideas of Einstein, and how his theory came to be widely accepted as truth.  This is not so much a biography, as it centers more so on Relativity, and the latter not in it's literal mathematical or material meaning, but rather its formation, general development and finally, acceptance among other physicists, and the public.  And these matters took of course a good deal of time and patience.  Einstein's first wife is mentioned in passing.  Highly recommended, being in part a look at Einstein, yet also as an intriguing examination of science itself.

This DVD concentrates more so on the social acceptance of Einstein's theories: by the intelligentsia, and by the physicists themselves.  It does have occasional glimpses into the theories, but for one on the strict science, I suggest you go some place else.  (Such as the PBS special Peter Ustinov did in the late 1970s.)  Nonetheless, this is so well done, it is interesting in it's own right.",1382745600,,1314,5.253588516746412
8296004,5,B001E1822M,"I bought it with the intention of sharing with my kids, but I watched it first but then decided that Einstein's life with the mistress and all the controversy wasn't appropriate to share with a 10 year old and 9 year old. But for adults, it's definitely a great one to watch. It presented various facets of Einstein's life that I never knew. I recommend it.",1360368000,2,357,4.424242424242424
8296005,5,B001E1822M,I brought this DVD home from the library and we were so impressed with the program that we bought our own copy.  We've watched it several times with various friends and family members.  The program does an excellent job of explaining Einstein's theories in a way that is easy to digest.  What we found fascinating was the struggle that ensued to prove his general relativity theory.  The story has all the makings for a good Hollywood drama!  I highly recommend this DVD.,1311465600,,471,4.695121951219512
8296006,5,B001E1822M,"I bought this for my husband who is a physicist. I had no intention of watching it myself. However I was making lunch one day when he slipped in the DVD, and I was hooked while listening from the adjoining  room. I finished lunch in front of the TV fascinated by the story I had never heard about. Especially the difficulty and the years it took to try to confirm Einstein's theory of relativity - what some scientists went through just to be at the right spot to photograph an eclipse that would help prove the theory - I can't do it justice with my review or explanation. Highly Recommended!!!",1248652800,18,595,4.409090909090909
8296007,1,B001E1822M,"At first glance, this appears to be a factual biology of Einstein and his quest for a General Theory of Relativity.  But about half way through, the narration changes its tone from a presentation of facts to a vehement argument for pacifism at any cost regardless of historical perspective or consequence, casting Einstein as supporting evidence.

In short, this is a propaganda film.  It drips with its own point of view, rather than presenting an unbiased historical perspective.

Too bad.  It is fairly well produced.",1247097600,5,520,5.070588235294117
8296008,5,B001E1822M,"I first saw part of this movie on History channel and now I own it.  Before this movie, I had trouble seeing the forest for the trees when it comes to Einstein. But this movie explains the four most prominent theories (from his miracle year in 1905) using stunning graphics and explanations from contemporary physicists.  This is my favorite part of the movie.

But, there is a broader story being told about how a great man can almost be overlooked by institutional thinking.  And, how relatively mundane things like clouds and international disputes (okay wars) can threaten to extinguish some of the most important scientific advancements ever.

Einstein is not portrayed as a saint here either. His personal details both charming and somewhat crass are all woven into the story of how one of the greatest minds of history unlocked and proved some of the most perplexing problems to date.

I love it. If you care anything about Einstein, get it.  It is not overly technical and it is fascinating on all dimensions.",1235001600,32,1017,4.84393063583815
