2251311,5,B0007YDB82,Great educational toy. I have 2 kids with special needs and this is a great way for them to learn to read. I am having a hard time finding more DVD Books for the system. Found some here. Hope they continue to make them.,1141171200,2,219,4.0
2251312,5,B0007YDB82,"This Read with Me DVD helps kids with letter recognition, matching lower and upper case letters together! It also emphasizes rhyming, which is an important pre-reading awareness. My daughters and I found out about Chicka Chicka Boom Boom from Blue's Clues, so when this showed up Christmas morning, they were so excited. My almost four-year-old daughter understood how to use this toy with only minimal instruction from me. She watched the dvd ""read"" the book to her, and then she chose to play games based on the book she had just read. It is very interactive, educational, mesmerizing and entertaining. She will play with this for 30 min-1 hour, asking me questions every now and then. She likes that she controls what happens, whether it's just reading or playing the games. She asks to play this when she wants to be a ""big"" kid. She thinks she's playing video games, just like Dad!",1136419200,10,886,4.7973856209150325

It appears that the DVD is more set up for computer use",1438300800,,167,4.419354838709677
8053937,5,B0007YDB82,"This product is not only educational, but an excellent choice to do together with your child.  You two can read the story, play other activities, and learn words in the story.  It has a fun vocabulary in this particular DVD that kids like.  You have to be aware that it must be played on the Fisher Price Read With Me DVD system.",1278892800,,329,4.274193548387097
8053938,5,B0007YDB82,"My son loves this video and the book, he will watch & read Chicka Chicka over and over again.  He has the book memorized as well and I even have an audio version we listen to while taking a bath.",1252540800,,195,3.875
8053939,4,B0007YDB82,"Purchased this item (as well as 1 similar) as a Christmas gift for my 3 yr old grand dauughter. My only disappointment is that the storybook is not included. So my daughter and I have decided that we will need to purchase the accompanying storybooks. Very pleased with the educational scale, but my grand daughter prefers more game interaction (at 3 she is still learning to be patient). My experience is that cd's are not very durable overall, so time will tell with usage. Therefore, I give this 4 stars.",1230681600,,506,4.633333333333334
8053940,5,B0007YDB82,Very educational and entertaining Even comes along with a few bonus movies that are educational as well. Great for preschoolers and kindergarteners. Entertaining enough for parents to enjoy with children too.,1217548800,,208,5.741935483870968
8053941,5,B0007YDB82,I brought this dvd for my son and he just loves watching the ABC's climb the tree and fall down.  Plus the song is very catchy.  Not to mention you can learn to reconize the letters.  and the games that are at the end entertains my two year old and the console helped him learn some shapes so he is able to play without adult help.,1195603200,,331,3.984848484848485
8053942,5,B0007YDB82,"My toddler enjoys this Fisher Price Read With Me DVD very much!  She asks for Chicka Chicka Boom Boom frequently.  She learned to match her capital and small letters at age two using this system.  It's easy to operate--she runs the system herself. She watches the story one time through, then goes right to the learning games every time.",1171929600,,337,4.677966101694915
8053943,5,B0007YDB82,"My children (3&6) lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve this DVD & all the games / activities that go with it!  This is their favorite story!!  And they actually share & take turns with the controller!  This system is great because the controls are simple enough for the 3-yr-old to use (sometimes he's happy just turning the page & hearing the story), and the games & reading on your own practice are engaging enough for the 6-yr-old.  If you have the Read With Me DVD System, I highly recommend this DVD!",1167868800,,494,4.709302325581396
