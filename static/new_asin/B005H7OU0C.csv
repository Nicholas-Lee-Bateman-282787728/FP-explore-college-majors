8472701,2,B005H7OU0C,"The photography is pretty good here, but it's wasted by being badly jump-cut together and with a next-to-nothing story.  I'd give it a miss...",1381622400,,142,4.916666666666667
8472702,5,B005H7OU0C,Don't even try to follow the plot. Just submerge into the beautiful photography of this picture. It's quite enough. I would compare this to some early Werner Herzog movies.,1376092800,,172,4.9655172413793105
8472703,3,B005H7OU0C,"This 1971 Hungarian film is visually one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.  I will be glad to see it again, though the story of an aging roue revisiting all his old ""loves"" never engaged me on the intellectual or emotional level.",1353110400,,235,4.340909090909091
