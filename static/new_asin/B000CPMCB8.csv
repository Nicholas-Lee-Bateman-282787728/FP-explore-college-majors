8100133,1,B000CPMCB8,"The synopsis is that two Confederate brothers disguise themselves as Union soldiers in order to get some tedious message to John Wilkes-Booth (I think) whilst being pursued by a `disgruntled' Union officer who has his own plans for the letter.

Well the titles are awful to begin with - the music is so bad that it sounds like it has been done by some school kids experimenting in Kraftwek covers. Then the `acting' starts and it is so obvious that these guys are re-enactors who mostly like a good stay in a pie shop in between firing their `pieces'. They deliver their lines with all of the conviction of a hedge fund manager explaining why he got a phone number bonus. When they die they do that am dram clutch of the stomach and fall over slowly onto a soft piece of `battle ground' - oh very dear indeed.

The plot is so boring as to encourage you to do anything rather than watch the screen; I cleaned the rabbit hutch - twice! And I don't even have a rabbit. This just lurches from one dismal `scene' to the next. I can't even find a rating on IMDB - it is so bad no-one has bothered to tell us - that is a first. I saw this on Amazon Instant Video as I am a war film fan. This is a vanity project and as such should be avoided at all costs. Even if you were in this it would be too shameful to admit to have seen it. The blurb above says `suitable for over 15 years' - well I must take exception to that as it is suitable for absolutely no-one. Community cable channels were never this bad.",1428710400,,1498,4.162068965517242
8100134,1,B000CPMCB8,"""TOTAL GARBAGE""!!! I couldn't make it through the first scene! My granddaughters kindergarten tooth fairy play was a more professional production! I hope all profits are going to some worthy charity! Every actor involved in this production should sue their acting coaches, then the actors, director, and producers should go home and hang themselves!",1421884800,,349,5.481481481481482
