8762840,5,B01GFB4T1I,"If you have not seen Justice League: Doom yet, and you are a DC fan, or at the very least, you saw Justice League when it hit theaters in 2017, then you must, nay, need to see this film.  I have often found it ironic that Marvel kills it on the big screen, but their animated works are always lackluster.  With DC, their big screens are always big flops, but their animated material is perfect.  I argued with a co-worker over JL the Movie, who stated there was no way to build a plot that involved all characters of the JL, introduce all seven whilst giving Cyborg a backstory, and keep the film under 2 hours.  I immediately told them to see JL: War.  And that is all I have to say on the matter.

As for JL Doom, it too is good.  The voice acting and animation is spot on, with a terrific plot.  The JL are attacked by one of their own without realizing it, and it is up to the one to save them all.  OF course, they are on a time limit as a much larger threat looms over their dire predicaments.  An excellent price for two excellent films, I highly recommend both!",1524009600,,1069,4.120772946859903
