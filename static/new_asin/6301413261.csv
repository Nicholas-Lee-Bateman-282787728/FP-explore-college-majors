7811603,1,6301413261,"This video is junk.  The first hint was the Chevrolet ad on the front cover of the VHS box.  Then the first 3 minutes is an ad for a Chevy van.  Half way through the video they make a trip to the hardware store, in their new Chevy van.  They then explain that these ads are important because the video would have been more expensive if they didn't have the advertisement.

In the video all windows and doors went into perfectly level and plumb frames.  No trouble shooting or hints.  For example they installed some new french doors.  He says, lets check to see if the threshold is level?  Perfect, ok, let's nail it up.  Oh, and they hammer in all nails.  No pneumatic nailers or cordless drills.  1/3 of the video is watching them hammer in nails.  What a waste of my time and money.

If you want a great video ""Tom Law"" has an excellent video.  ""Gary Katz"" has a very good book and so does ""Scott McBride.",1114905600,5,908,4.258823529411765
