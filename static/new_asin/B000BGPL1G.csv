2416177,2,B000BGPL1G,"This dvd was highly recommended to me, so my expectations were rather high. But it is too easy. I may have underrated my own level and that is a good thing, I guess... It's pretty boring also. The same songs go on for 10 minutes or even longer. I'm going to find a beginning banjo player who may have more to gain from it.
If I understand it correctly, the next dvd up is a LOT more difficult so I'll have to find something else to jam to. (Jam with? On? For? Dunno, not my language.)",1284940800,,484,4.052083333333333
2416178,3,B000BGPL1G,"I thought the dvd was ok, but for a fiddler like myself it really didn't teach me much of anything.  I would like to have seen more detail for playing back up with a fiddle.",1237507200,2,173,3.942857142857143
2416179,3,B000BGPL1G,"Purchased for my kids to play with.  They enjoyed it, anytime you can ""jam"", even with the video it is helpful..  I think that it may have helped their timing and confidence.",1232928000,3,174,4.40625
2416180,5,B000BGPL1G,"I just bought ""Bluegrass Slow Jam for the Total Beginner"" and ""Intermediate Bluegrass Jamming"" DVDs. I popped the ""Beginner"" DVD into my PC and started playing along. I played the entire DVD at one sitting (my fingertips were really dented afterwards too). It was a total blast singing and playing with the jam group, consisting of a Bass, Mandolin, Banjo, Guitar, Dobro, and Fiddle. Pete Wernick (Dr. Banjo) gives instruction on playing along with a jam. He emphasizes playing by watching and listening because most of bleugrass music was not written down until the early 60s. This affected me because I have always needed the music to play. I realize that I need to develop that ability. The jam asks you to play breaks (solos) and he gives you some hints on how to play something, anything really, for your break. Even though they use only four chords (G, D, C, A) in the ""Beginner"" DVD, it still was a good lesson in changing chords in real-time. I was exhausted, thrilled, and satisifed with my purchase.",1156723200,21,1009,4.738636363636363
2416181,5,B000BGPL1G,"People, it doesn't get much easier than this when it comes to practicing at home. ""Dr. Banjo"" Pete Wernick slows it down even further than his successful Bluegrass Jamming video so that anyone with an acoustic instrument (even the most novice player) can get comfortable performing with other musicians.

With the help of Colorado bluegrass musicians such as Nick Forster, Sally Van Meter, Drew Emmitt and others, this video covers nearly two hours worth of folk and bluegrass standards that are sure to be familiar to almost anyone. Wernick has chosen to keep these interactive performances to their simplest form by sticking with four common music chords (G, C, D and A), and eliminating solo breaks on most of the songs.

Along with the 17 play-along songs, there are also jamming tips presented between songs. Wernick is a great motivator to get people started playing musical instruments, and his laid-back yet factual presentation shows that he is probably the best at this position. A great addition to this edition is the simultaneous viewing of the guitar player's fretting hand so that the student can be familiar with chord changes. Wernick also varies up the overall performance by having everyone at the session perform vocally. While the vocal skills vary in quality, it does give off the message that at bluegrass and folk jam sessions such as this, one doesn't have to be ""professional"" to have a good time performing.

The only weakness to this video is the overall production and editing. There are too many times that Wernick has make up ""excuses"" for changes to props and lineups that could flow better if a script was followed more closely. However, since this is being used more for educational and instructional entertainment purposes, the flaws are not a major factor.

Besides being a useful tool for the absolute beginner, this video has another useful purpose. Many musicians learn a second or third instrument to make themselves more versatile, especially when attempting to join a band. Since these are familiar songs, a guitarist attempting to learn banjo, mandolin, fiddle or whatever may find that he/she has an instant backing track to simple but complete songs to work on the new instrument.

Wernick has been a great ambassador of teaching bluegrass and folk music for a number of years, and this video helps to get his wonderful educational message out to more potential musicians who are not familiar with him. Bluegrass Slow Jam should be recommended to anyone learning a new acoustic instrument and wanting to see and hear how it is to work with other musicians before going ""live.""

2416191,4,B000BGPL1G,"I am not reviewing this as a musician.  I ordered this at my wife's request when she took up playing the stand-up bass.  This DVD is not intended to teach you to play bluegrass bass.  Rather it sets you down in a helpful jam where you can practice.  I attended jams with my wife as she learned to play, and at the very beginning the jams she enjoyed were the ones where someone in the group would  let her know what key they were playing in and maybe even calling out when the chords changed.  Later she would learn to watch the guitar player's hand to help with that. The jams she enjoyed less were when they just went off and running without stating what key they were playing in, or in addition played songs with keys she hadn't learned yet. This DVD simulates one of the more helpful slow jams.  She moved to different parts of the DVD to practice certain songs.  Not only was this good practice, but it also helped her develop a set of standard bluegrass tunes she felt comfortable playing.  At most jams, the musicians take turns suggesting songs, and she had a set from the DVD she could fall back on and feel comfortable playing.

She also took regular lessons and eventually moved on to the intermediate DVD.  So her experience was great with this DVD in making her feel more comfortable jamming with other musicians.",1401753600,6,1326,4.43801652892562

2416195,5,B000BGPL1G,Great pace and split screen fingering for the chords makes this DVD a winner. Pete and friends give us beginners a pace and chord challenge (two chords then three chords per song) that allows successful playing early on. Success reinforces more practice and promotes advancement into more complex songs. Highly recommended.,1383868800,6,323,5.352941176470588

2416198,5,B000BGPL1G,"As a beginning banjo player, I tried in the past to learn to play the banjo from books but wasn't successful. I finally found a banjo instructor to learn from, who recommended I buy the Bluegrass Slow Jam DVD. When it arrived, I found it very useful and helpful to ""play along with"" the band on the DVD. The musicians on the DVD not only play music you can play along with. They give advice on playing techniques, information on bluegrass history, and helpful hints on how to play the various different instruments that are played by the musicians. The DVD has different levels the beginning musician can progress through with many different songs to play along with. It is well worth the minimal price it costs.",1350000000,6,712,4.6141732283464565

8086489,5,B000BGPL1G,"This is a great DVD for those learning to jam.  The songs are quite slow, which is perfect for me.  I like how they stress reading the guitar players chords to follow along.  All the players have nice personalities and you really feel like you're in a jam with them.  I also like how they have space for you to play the break, that's very cool.",1461196800,,344,4.166666666666667

I am lucky to have several regular jams in my area but am not always able to attend every week. Having been to a few jams, this DVD is a bit slower than I need, but I knew what I was buying and I am not disappointed in any way. I really like Pete's delivery of such great information about playing in jam sessions. I learned a lot my first time through. I'm looking forward to playing with the songs on the DVD many times over and even working up some of them to present when I finally get up the courage to take my turn in the circle. I found almost all the songs on this DVD to be at least somewhat familiar and I'm sure any of them would be welcomed at the jams I attend. I have ordered the next DVD in the series.",1416787200,,808,3.96319018404908
