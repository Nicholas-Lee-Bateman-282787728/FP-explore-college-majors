If you are looking for the film the trailer is showing, this is not the same film.  The Editorial Reviews section is the movie that you will get.  The trailer does not match the plot that is in the editorial reviews.",1453593600,,428,4.209876543209877
8645711,1,B00IVLR9YK,"This one was unanimously voted a dud, in our house.  We were expecting a cute, kiddie/family summer film about a dog, like others we've bought through the years.  What we got was a film with little emphasis on the dog (who doesn't even resemble the cute dog on the cover) and much more on the large cast of Asian actors.  I double checked to be sure it was the right DVD in the package, it was so different from the cover photo & description.  We donated our copy to the local thrift shop.",1404345600,2,489,4.225806451612903
