7999535,3,B0000CNY44,"This is a typical Italian macho tough guy flick. Lots of bravado, action type movie (like car chases, gun fights, prison yard fights, tough talk and ganster action). Symple plot with very little depth and very predicatable. Lots of scenes and scenery in Italy. Quality of the movie is just okay. Kind of Grind House flavor.",1390867200,,323,4.785714285714286
7999536,3,B0000CNY44,"This review is from: Escape From Death Row [DVD] [Region 1] [US Import] [NTSC] (DVD)
Tony in prison after Tony saves his life. Things go horribly wrong for Frankie as his lawyer and brother gets killed, his empire crumbles, and he is stuck in prison. He must rely on Crazy Tony for help.

The film is not top notch. It has some comedic elements that border on camp. Likewise the tough guy talk is more camp than serious. Because it was foreign, it is difficult to tell what was meant to be funny and what was accidentally funny. The production is not a timeless classic, and will only have a narrow audience.

Parental Guide: Edwige Fenech- shower nudity",1390521600,,654,4.533898305084746
7999537,3,B0000CNY44,"An Italian gangster film starring Lee Van Cleef can't be that bad, and this certainly isn't, just nothing spectacular about it.  The 70's time period is right on, as are the clothes & cars, and there are some decent moments.  As with others in this sub-genre, kinda tedious & talky, but that's what second slots on drive-in double bills were for.  Find it cheap & you'll be happy with it.",1351987200,,388,4.514285714285714
