8311291,4,B001IQDAH0,"I ordered this DVD double feature used via Amazon.

La Isla de los Dinosaurios (Island of the Dinosaurs) is pretty good.  A group of scientists go to a mysterious island that happens of be chock full of angry dinosaurs and some put-upon Cro-Magnon type Homo-Sapien cavemen.  Been done before and since except that this one is in Spanish.  It played beautifully.

The other movie did not play at all well because someone had written on that side with a Sharpie pen.  BIG mistake.  NEVER WRITE ON A DVD OR CD.  I'm keeping it for the side that played well.

I can only recommend this DVD release for the side that I was able to view.",1370131200,,631,4.417391304347826
8311292,2,B001IQDAH0,"...I got this for the invisible man and not the other. it's because the other i knew had way too much lousy stock footage of other movies like valley of the dragons. Inv. mn would have been better/complete if it had english dubbing or at least eng. subtitles-(so all u see or can enjoy is the inv. man, unless you no spanido-ha. At least its an orig. film. Luckily i found it used in great cond. for grnd total of 7.14$ on amazon.

If the rest of these (abbreviations) aren't clear, then thats crazy. (it's) fun to do and can be clear enough; though i habitually and understandably went overboard abbreviating due to my using library timed pcs. Its also because typing perfect grammar, which i can indeed do, proven here, is also a pain, not as fun, and are in some areas debatable/imperfect.",1300320000,,792,4.5
8311293,4,B001IQDAH0,"Not a bad movie. Four folks are off to find the lost Atlantis and rain forces their plane down onto an unknown prehistoric island. It has to be Atlantis because there are cactus plants right? The plane is damaged. Also lot of stock footage of lizards fighting each other and the ground opening up. The dinosaurs, or lizards, fall into pits and lava pours on them. Not a bad 1957 movie. One pretty gal goes swimming and then is taken by the caveman. She teaches him how to make a spear, and does he ever need it when a gorilla attacks the blond. There is a giant armadillo, a gorilla, and huge lizards chasing folks in the movie. The main actor, Armando Silvestre, plays the cave man. He is in almost all of the K. Gordon Murray Mexican dubbed wrestling women movies. He plays a cop in Dr. Doom and Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy. He also is starring as ""neutron"", a caped hero and bad guy fighter. A lot of fun watching this because of all the lizards are dressed up as dinosaurs. A lot of blood at the end of the lizard wrestling matches. The blond gets her hair wet, but later has her hair in a ratted poof 60's hair style again with out a rat tail brush or hairdryer. This movie is now on a double dvd with ""La Isla De Los Dinosaurios"" and ""El Hombre Que Logro SerA"". The new new dvd is available now and has English subtitles. Only $10 as a double feature dvd with the ""new Invisible man"" at creep classics. I am surprised to see that Amazon does not have a clue about the new double dvd. NTSC is the label. These folks here are trying to rip you off for $50 or more for one movie, when you can get two movies for $10.00. To be fair they might think they have the last two copies, so they want to charge accordingly.
