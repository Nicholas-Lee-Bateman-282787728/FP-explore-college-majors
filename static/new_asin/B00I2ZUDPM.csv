8638534,5,B00I2ZUDPM,"Well done sci-fi/horror.  Interesting take on the ""Probably shouldn't sign up for medical trials"" story.  Good performances, well directed, kept me engaged.",1441584000,,156,6.045454545454546
8638535,5,B00I2ZUDPM,This movie is surprisingly good.  Don't let this films obscurity keep you from watching it.  It has solid performances from a cast of lesser  known actors and has above average production values.  The synopsis given by other reviewers is accurate so I won't go into the details.  Well worth the time.,1429315200,,300,4.803921568627451
8638536,5,B00I2ZUDPM,"I just watched this film without knowing much about it and loved every minute of it. I'm a huge ""Travis Van Winkle"" fan so I was pleased he was one of the stars. This is what a horror /slasher movie should be. Great effects and lots of gore including an awesome decapitation with no cut away.

The storyline was interesting and I was never waiting for something exciting to happen because the entire film was a homerun in my opinion.

It had some great gross out moments and some creepy bite your lip moments as well. It's comparable to (Insanitarium) but better. I highly recommend this film.",1425081600,,593,4.5327102803738315
8638537,4,B00I2ZUDPM,"I think this is a great movie to watch to pass time by. That is why you never agree to be a test dummy, almost seen surreal. But in the end I think everyone that was behind everything got what they deserved. But I would recommend others to watch this movie.",1400284800,,257,4.0588235294117645
8638538,4,B00I2ZUDPM,"Two college kids decide to allow themselves to be guinea pigs for pharmaceutical testing in order to make some extra cash.  Greg (Travis Van Winkle) and Aaron (Joe Pingue) are given a tour of the place by Nigel (Rik Young) whose quirky character was reminiscent of Brad Pitt in ""12 Monkeys.""

The facility looks like a prison hospital.  They are told they are testing a new allergy drug, but the guys are hip enough to know better. They also suspect someone in the group will get the placebo.

Dr. Wilcox (Tricia Helfer) runs the experiment and tries to keep things under control when they get out of hand. Weird things happen as there is a slow and steady build-up. Eventually a snooping patient (the one with the placebo) finds out what the real experiment is about and wants out. Leaving is not an option.

Decent sci-fi horror until Eric Roberts showed up at the end.  Good sound track.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (Mircea Monroe) attempted rape.",1352419200,,943,4.678787878787879
