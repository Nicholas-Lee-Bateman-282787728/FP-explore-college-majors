8577004,5,B00C3DIWG6,"Now more than ever films such as this are as relevant and impotent as they will ever be. This incredible look into tension at the Israeli/Palestinian border is so well acted and directed it is hard to believe it was not real life. Evelyne Brochu deserves an Oscar for this multi-layered role. I was drawn right in, and kept engaged to the very last second. I watched it a second time and I will see it again.",1406246400,5,408,4.311688311688312
8577005,2,B00C3DIWG6,Actors are very good and the visuals are amazing.  But the story drags to an inevitable end and is slow.  Hard time staying alert as well acted dramatic moments were followed by a sluggish drop giving no plot advancement.,1404864000,,221,4.641025641025641
8577006,2,B00C3DIWG6,In some  respects it was bias however if was in English it would have been more understood.  Might explain WHY the man had been in the Israeli prison and might explain the mentality of the Palestine  I know for a fact that Israel is not as horrible as portrayed  by the media.,1392163200,2,276,4.25
