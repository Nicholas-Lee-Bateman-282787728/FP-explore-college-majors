8087515,5,B000BJGJN2,"This is an unusual look at life of two Russian brothers, aged seven and twelve, whose father was absent during World War II. The eldest is an intelligent boy who loved to read history about a Roman Emperor. The youngest is interested in war games and explosives with an imagination to go with it.
*The brothers were associated with a gang whose members had no fathers around, which gave them freedom to do as they please. But, all that changed when their father returned from a long absence to find that his sons grew up without him. He's a strict man who took control of his son's activities. This film is about the conflicts between the father and the sons over the loss of their freedoms.
*To add to the problems is a chemist who has proposed to marry the brother's mother, a conman uncle who tries to break up the marriage of their parents, and the father's inability to obtain work because he doesn't have necessary documents. I thoroughly enjoyed the humorous exchange between all the characters involved in it.
*The movie has a rather unique ending to it but, unlike other reviewers, I won't spoil the scene. You'll have to watch it, which you'll enjoy leading up to the end.
*CAUTION: The review on the DVD case states that the mother had married another man when the father was away. Unless I missed something, that was not revealed in the movie. Also, I noticed that the subtitles did not appear to keep up with the conversations, which could make it difficult to follow who is saying what. The story was laid out very well, which allowed me to use intuition to follow along with little difficulty.",1210809600,2,1608,4.586805555555555
