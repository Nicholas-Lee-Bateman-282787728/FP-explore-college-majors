8652574,4,B00JO49AOA,"Some of the jokes didn't age very well, but it's definitely better than the second H&K flick.",1519084800,,93,4.529411764705882

8652577,2,B00JO49AOA,"The MAIN reason I went with Goodwill, on this purchase, was that this was SUPPOSED to be the Collector's Edition, complete with Blu-ray & DVD, 3 ping-pong balls, & (drum roll) a Waffle Bot figure.  The SINGLE Blu-ray disk was ALL I sent.
When I emailed the Store on this matter, as they directed, I never received a response.  For the PRICE I paid, I would have been better off getting this same Blu-ray BRAND NEW!!!  :-(
As for the MOVIE itself, it seems to be a natural progression of our beloved, Stoner Heroes.  The Christmas backdrop immediately sets it apart from first two. The humor retains the series raunchy irreverence, & Neil Patrick Harris is ever the scene stealer.  So I'd rate the MOVIE itself a 3 out of 5 as I found it not quite as funny as the previous 2 movies.",1419552000,,781,4.395833333333333
8652578,5,B00JO49AOA,"I love Harold & Kumar. I have been a huge fan of this series since the first ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" debuted in theaters in 2004. ""A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas"" completes my Harold & Kumar series. It is a very funny movie and carries on the legacy that is Harold & Kumar. I would recommend this Collector's Edition Gift set because not only do you receive the movie, it also comes with three beer pong balls and a Waffle bot which make great additions to a Man Cave.",1418169600,,481,4.182795698924731
