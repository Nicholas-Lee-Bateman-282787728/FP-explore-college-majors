8289071,1,B001CRRAIA,I had seen them before and I love them so much but the ones I received had a different region code and therefore can not be played in the usa.  Not sure if i just missed that part of the sellers description or if it wasn't listed that way but this set makes for a poor paper weight in any case.,1430265600,,294,3.819672131147541

8289073,4,B001CRRAIA,"I love the Watch series and I was ecstatic when I heard they we're going to make a movie(s) about the series. The book series itself is a very unique and interesting venture, it's kinda like Harry Potter but for adults and focuses a lot about morality.

The movie is loosely based on the books, for starters book one of the series is called Night Watch while the second installment is called Day Watch. In the film both Day/Night watch events take place in the first book. So if they really wanted to film the whole series I would imagine there would probably be 10+ films.

To enjoy the Night/Day watch series you don't need to read the books or know the back ground, it's fully explained in the books, though I have had friends who watched the film and got lost, but nothing major to derail them from enjoying the film.

This film is fascinating and this genre is rarely tapped into, especially in a modern setting. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of magic lores, vampires, werewolves, cryptozoology kinda things. Try reading the books as well if you enjoyed the films, they're ten folds better!",1285113600,,1116,4.514851485148514
