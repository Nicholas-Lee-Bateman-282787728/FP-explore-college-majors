But after he loses a baseball game for his team the Knights he is  magically transported back in time to the days of King Arthur. A place  where is 20th century knowlege and courage is all that can protect him.  WHen he finds out that Merlin himself was the one that brought him hear he  is shocked (and so is Merlin) that Calvin is supposed to be a Hero that  will save King Arthur's Kingdom. Will Calivn suceed? Or is he better of in  the 20th century. If you like Midevil tales and kid flicks you should see  this movie. Hey, Cal isn't that bad looking either =)",965865600,8,647,4.289256198347108
750008,5,6303925243,"No matter how many times I watch this movie, or the older I get, I am still in love with it! Being a fan of the time of King Arthur, and time  travel without the use of science fiction novel tactics, this movie was a  thrill for me to watch!
The lead character, Calvin, is a less than  popular guy back in his home town of Receda, California. When he is  suddenly thrown through time with the help of Merlin, he finds himself in a  completely different world. Although the plot doesn't exactly follow any of  the stories of King Arthur (i.e. King Aurthur and Guinevere never had any  kids, obviously. She ran away w/ Lancelot) but it has the romantic appeal  of the time period, and Calvin's friendships with the king and his youngest  daughter, Princess Catherine are wonderful! As it goes on, his character  flaws are sraightened out and he becomes a stronger person, faced with many  tasks most persons never endure. The final scene's tie it all together  until he finally goes home, and realizes he can be the person he aspires  to.
The film is absolutely wonderful with the adventure, romance, and  humor tying togther to make a memorable occassion. I strongly suggest A Kid  in King Arthur's Court to anyone who wants a great time, a laugh and a  smile!",965433600,17,1259,4.528888888888889
750009,5,6303925243,"I enjoyed this sample of Kate Winslet's early work.  At the end when she reveals herself as the Black Knight, my 12-year-old grandaughter stood up and shouted ""KATE SHINES!!!!""  My sentiments exactly.  Kate has  such screen presence, she is like a magnet.  It is interesting to see the  early work of an actress before the blockbuster success Titanic.  She's a  treasure, able to analyze and interpret human emotion for all of us.",923788800,,430,4.875

750231,5,6303925243,"Here is a classic movie that stars Kate Winslet, Daniel Craig, Joss Ackland and Ron Moody who are very well known.  The young teenage star, Thomas Ian Nickolas demonstrated remarkable talent that made him worthy to be part of a famous acting cast.  The talent scouts for Disney have
a gift for finding young actors to compliment the famous.  This is an excellent family movie in the well known Disney tradition that any person regardless of age can enjoy.  An excellent fantasy in which Calvin Fuller (viz. Thomas Ian Nickolas) who is playing little league baseball was caught in an earthquake, falls in a fissure and ends up back in the Court of King Arthur.  It is hilarious as the Court of King Arthur can not discipher his ""valley language"" from Reseda, California - as well as some of the Teenage Recreation Equipment prototyped by a peasant Blacksmith!  The ending is superb.  This Disney Classic movie did not receive the recognition it deserved.  All of the main acting members of the cast went on to more stardom - and Thomas Ian Nickolas was worthy of such recognition and promotion also.
This is an excellent movie for a DVD Classic collection.",1461024000,2,1155,4.74

750467,5,6303925243,"""A Kid in King Arthur's Court"" tells the story of young Calvin Fuller, a young boy somewhat discontent with life and hoping for more. A chance encounter with fate gives him just that when he is magically swept through time to the days of the legendary King Arthur. The wizard Merlin reaching through the ages for a great warrior ends up with Calvin instead. Now, Calvin must rise to the occasion and save Camelot. Along the way he learns valuable lessons about love, friendship, and heroism. I recommend this one for any fans of Disney, or anyone who's ever dreamed of being a hero. :-)",1432598400,,586,4.59047619047619

Considering how they've butchered the ratios on their animated features released on DVD by cutting off the tops and bottoms just to make them ""family-friendly widescreen"", as they call it, I guess they didn't want to waste money or precious remastering time on this one. Should have just stuck with the VHS version I already own.",1422921600,6,503,4.662921348314606

750837,4,6303925243,"Calvin Fuller (Thomas Ian Nichols) has just lost the big baseball game for his little league team, the Reseda Knights.  The worse part is, he didn't even try but just stood there as he struck out.  Just as he's returning to the dug out, an earthquake hits, and Calvin is swallowed by the giant hole that opens in the ground.

To his surprise, Calvin lands in 6th century England.  Because his appearance foiled the Black Knight, Calvin is hailed as a hero by the aging King Arthur (Joss Ackland).

However, all is not rosy in Camelot.  Lord Belasco (Art Malik) has turned the people against Arthur and plans to get his hands on the crown by whatever means he can.  In fact, this is the very reason that Merlin (Ron Moody) has summoned Calvin.  But Calvin is a kid who can't even muster the courage to swing a bat.  Can he find the courage to defeat the evil Belasco?

I first saw this movie when it was in the theater and loved it.  I hadn't seen it since but rewatched it recently.  It lost some of its charm in those years, but it was still plenty fun.  Based loosely on a Mark Twain classic, it keeps the action moving forward.  There were lots of laughs as Calvin tried to explain himself in the historical setting.  The movie is predictable, but that doesn't really dampen any of the fun.  Some of the scenes of special effects haven't aged well, but all the actors take it seriously enough to make that a minor point.

My Daughter is a huge Daniel Craig fan and she got the film just to see what he looked like before she was one year old. (she's now 12)  This is run of the mill, every line is predictable stuff but, I must say after having taken my daughter to see Casino Royale 9 times, this was a real hoot!!!  It is fun seeing actors early in their career paying their dues.  i have seen an episode of the old 1950's TV series Highway Patrol and it had Clint Eastwood as a Biker.  It was one of the first things he ever did.  Anyway, I would reccommend this movie if you need a good laugh, unintentional as it may be.",1170547200,3,759,4.040268456375839

So the ""kid"" in question is playing baseball.  Apparently he is not very good at it (ie: strikes out a lot).  After he strikes out to his arch-baseball-rival-pitcher-guy, a big gigantic earthquake came and sucked him into a big whole which apparently is some sort of inside-earth-time-wormhole, or something.  They don't really explain that, well it's a kids movie, so I will give them that one for free.  Anyways, he gets spat out in the medieaval ages in ""Camelot.""  A few items about King Arthur and his family, Arthur never reached old age, in this movie he appeared as a grandfather figure.  And he also didn't have two daughters (he had one son, Mordred) as in this movie.

Well, most of the movie is spent with the people from that era usually the nobility and knights and Arthur's one daughter who is the kid's age, oggling at his backpack (which he lukily brought with him) of futuristic ""wonders"" and they have a jolly good time.  But he wants to get back home.  Where's Merlin, oh, he's a willy old face in a well.  Yep.  So he gets about a days worth of knight training from a non-realistic generous knight and suddenly he's a master fighter and jouster as seen later in the film.

Anyways, the movie ends with him getting back and his new love (Arthur's daughter) and Arthur being in the real world with him (yeah, like Arthur would leave his kingdom for some kid) and he's sent back before the infamous strike out.  Blah blah blah.

All in all, kids may be impressed and like this movie.  I didn't find it too entertaining.  If you want a movie about a ""future guy"" in the past, a Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court was way better.  This didn't do it for me and may not for a lot of other people.",1106611200,2,1977,4.438888888888889
750844,5,6303925243,"Thomas Ian Nicholas is awesome in A KID IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT. He's very talented, and so is the rest of this cast. This movie is basically about a kid who lives in a town called Roceda, in California (I think). Anyway, during a Little League baseball game, Calvin (which is the kid's name) goes up to bat - and shaking all over in fear, of course - and almost instantly strikes out. While heading back to the bench, an earthquake starts to rumble, and everybody races out of the bench...except for Calvin. Instead, Calvin is magically transported back in the time of King Arthur! Once he gets there, Calvin meets Merlin, who sent him there by accident (thinking that Calvin was a knight because his baseball team was called the Knights). But when Calvin explains that he's not a real knight, Merlin tells him that Calvin ""will do"" and Calvin now must save the Kingdom of Camelot from the evil Lord Belasco who wants to try and take over the kingdom by trying to marry Princess Sarah (Kate Winslet), King Arthur's oldest daughter! Also, while helping King Arthur, Calvin of course, falls in love with King Arthur's youngest daughter, Princess Katie. (And before Calvin got transported back to the Middle Ages, he of course manages to retrieve his backpack full of modern-day items such as a CD Walkman and rollerblades, which he uses to impress the people of the Middle Ages.) This is a great film for all ages and kids find it quite entertaining (in fact, so did I - and I'm 17 years old!). It's really exciteding and fun to see Kate Winslet and Thomas Ian Nicholas playing roles in their earlier years of filming...and this movie is really funny, too.
P.S.: If you love Thomas Ian Nicholas, then check out these other great Thomas Ian Nicholas Flicks: ROOKIE OF THE YEAR, A KID IN ALADDIN'S PALACE, and AMERICAN PIE. And, if you love Kate Winslet, then check out these other Kate Winslet Flicks: SENSE AND SENSIBLITY, QUILLS (her new movie...still playing in theaters), and of course, TITANIC.",983404800,11,1996,4.689458689458689

He fights evil men who want to bring down King Arthur and his family. A little romance is mixed in and there is a happy ending.  Just my kind of movie.,1502150400,,319,3.8615384615384616
