8080054,3,B000AXFSV8,"This is an excellent introduction to basic Greek for the busy traveler. I liked seeing and hearing the words both in print and spoken by Greek speakers. I also have the Pimsleur DVD set, which is better for really using the language, but takes a lot longer and lacks visuals.
  Unfortunately my ""Greek 101"" DVD is defective. It stops after the word ""Today"" in level 1 and breaks up; losng the audio in the numbers section. I think it would be great if it worked. It makes me wonder if I recieved an old used copy by mistake.",1216857600,4,524,4.336734693877551
