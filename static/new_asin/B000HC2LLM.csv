8138058,4,B000HC2LLM,"Nice B movie with a couple of twists. What stood out was the piano man, Gene Rodgers. His two minute tune, Rajai Blues, was worth the price of the DVD by itself. I had my two boys watch it and they both enjoyed it. Can't find the song on CD unfortunately.",1321142400,,255,4.019607843137255
8138059,4,B000HC2LLM,"I really ordered this title in order to acquire a better print of ""Shoot to Kill"" than I had previously enoyed on Alpha Video, and I was not disappointed. Picture quality and sound were noticeably improved in the VCI version. The movie itself poses an intriguing question in the very opening scene: What were the district attorney, his wife, and a sought-after felon all doing in the same car wreck in which all were killed? The plot keeps you guessing about the answer until the very end. It packed a lot of entertainment into a little over an hour's running time.",1240790400,3,565,4.603960396039604
8138060,3,B000HC2LLM,"Good collection and my friends enjoyed the films more than I, but I watched and have loaned this DVD to others to view.  Delivery of this DVD very prompt.",1217721600,,154,4.310344827586207

Cesar Romero is a casino owner and finds himself mixed up in the murder of his former girlfriend, and he is the prime suspect ... now comes the time when Cesar will play detective and bring in the killer to the Hammer Studio with all the trimmings ... Kay Kendall who was married to Rex Harrison has top billing before she became an international star ... the top lineup goes to Victor Maddern as Limpy, wonderful part as the sympathetic character who is always picked on makes for a very atmospheric and dark thriller drenched in a frame up ... Maddern makes the most of this role as he is already a well known actor in the UK . . . . . another Hammer Film Noir, not to be forgotten remains in the genre we all crave to see again, again and again.
