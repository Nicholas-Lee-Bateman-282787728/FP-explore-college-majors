4960380,5,B00657PLN8,This film is an icebreaker for those who have walked the walk or watched someone else discover their sexuality. Well done!,1359849600,,122,4.857142857142857
4960381,1,B00657PLN8,"I think there was only one good male to male kiss in this movie. Would not buy it at any price. I have seen more gay teen boarding school romance sex in You are not Alone (1978.) Also the movie Maurice (1987) that had forbidden homosexual behaviors between two men over 21. This was the very early part of the 1900's before World War One. A very prudish time to grow up. If you like to watch good gay movies, then save your money and buy the two other gay movies that I have recommended in this video review.",1357603200,4,508,4.141414141414141
4960382,2,B00657PLN8,"Jitters is an unusual Islandic film that centers around Gabriel (Atli Oskar Fjalarsson) a very cute sixteen year old boy who goes to England for three weeks of school where he meets another rather cute lad named Markus. One night the two get drunk and out of the blue, with nothing leading up to it, no talk of any such subject, they just kiss.

With no explanation, the movie cuts to the end of their extremely short time there and they are both being met by parents to go home.

Back home, Gabriel is shown with his very strange lot of friends, (1) a perverted young man he has absolutely nothing in common with who is his disgusting best friend, (2) a suicidal girl who is in love with him and has a strained relationship with her overbearing crack snorting grandmother, (3) another girl who can't stand to live with her mother who is a drunken whore and comes on to the girls male friends, and a few others I couldn't keep straight throughout the film, but all equally weird, wild, confused and from very strange homes.

In the midst of all this really strange tail which makes little sense, Markus shows up and has gotten a job as a hairdresser in Gabriels town. The two eagerly hook up and go to a drug party where Markus disappears and Gabriel find him in a room naked having sex with a girl. This fries Gabriel's brain and he leaves, bewildered, never wanting to see Markus again.

Cut to an hour or so of meaningly parties, drugs, booze, a lot of throwing up and weird family situations.

Then Markus shows up again and he and Gabriel get into a fight and Gabe walks away. Gabriels friends walk in and approach Markus as to what is going on, and he outs Gabriel as gay. The friends don't seem to mind, in fact anything seems quite acceptable to this bunch, as if it's the twilight zone or something.

Kids sitting in a bar having fooled the bouncer with a fake I.D. but clearly looking like 13 year olds, 15 year olds moving into their own apartments and working, not even old enough to drive. Nothing much in this film is anywhere near realistic.

Eventually after every girl in Iceland has tried to seduce Gabriel and he just can't go there, they all give up and he finds Markus and they talk, and kiss again. The movie ends. The scope of this film, could have had some merit, but for some reason it just didn't.

I read the reviews for this film right here where you are now, and they were positive and the overall rating was 4 and half stars. I was impressed, so I bought the DVD thinking it should be good.

SOMEBODY LIED! Several somebody's actually, and I found it was the people who gave lower rating reviews who were telling the truth about this film.

Gabriel is ADORABLE so maybe that was all these people saw and didn't even try to pay attention to the movie, I don't know, but this is really a strange little flick. The subtitles don't seem to match with what's going on, as if half the conversations are never interpreted or something, so you miss part of what's going on simply as punishment for not speaking icelandish or whatever the language is.

IF YOU ENJOY watching a bunch of teenagers throwing up and being abused by a land full of adults who for the most part are psychotic, drunk losers, then this film is MUST SEE for you.

I truly WANTED this film to be very good! Gabriel is ADORABLE and after that kiss and those jitters he felt for the first time, he deserved to have a great story told here with his handsome mate Markus. I would have loved for them to have had a relationship and fallen in love and get all sweet and mushy. They deserved that, and the viewer deserves that as well. WHAT HAPPENED???

I didn't hate this film. The cast was WONDERFUL. Their characters were weird, but these kids are great actors. If they had been given a script to work with, this could have been great! There were a few cute moments, but not many. You have to wade through a lot of disgust and ignorance to find those few moments.

The first fifteen minutes is worth watching as well as the last five minutes. Beautiful in fact, but the rest is mind boggling, weird, hard to understand parts of it, depressing in places and just very poorly written.

That being said, the cast is great and the acting is superb. Sound and picture quality is ok, subtitles are not too wonderful. The DVD has a couple extras, such as Features and Behind The Scenes.

I do NOT recommend this film, BUT if you decide to watch it, just keep in mind what I and a couple other reviewers have written. It is not horrible IF you are prepared for what you're getting. This film however can in NO WAY live up to the expectations built by the deceiving reviews.",1353283200,8,4655,4.382830626450116
4960383,3,B00657PLN8,"Jitters is okay; I didn't hate it, but I can't say I like it; it's just too unbelievable to react to in much of any way at all.

Atli Oskar Fjalarsson is very cute, and although it's completely unbelievable that every girl he knows has the hots for him, I'd believe it in an instant if they were boys (but they're not).

In any other movie, a boy like him - a sweet, gentle, graceful, sympathetic, six-foot, 90-pound sylph-like pretty boy with flawless skin - would constantly be having to prove he's not gay, and constantly be bullied by gangs of straight boys and ridiculed by gangs of straight girls; but evidently it's not like that in Iceland. Everybody in this movie, of every age, male and female, seems to see Matthew McConaughey in him instead of Audrey Hepburn. It's a great mystery.

Unfortunately, Atli Oscar's cuteness is about all this silly movie has going for it. I never believed in anybody, so I never cared what happened to anybody. What's obviously supposed to be the great tragedy is simply ludicrous, but no more ludicrous than anything else that happens.

This is my first Icelandic movie, so it may be a cultural thing; although I have loved and related deeply to movies from all the other Scandinavian countries, Iceland is very different, and very much smaller. But it's a little hard to believe - even as isolated as that country is and always has been - that teenagers and even adults are as naive, as clueless, as simpleminded, almost, as they are in this movie.

I'm pretty sure Iceland is a modern, advanced country, but these people seem more out of touch than the Amish. Maybe it's true that Icelanders are extraordinarily simple, naive, backward people; if so, I can understand why the world isn't swarming with Icelandic movies. But for now I'm going to assume that Iceland is a great country and Icelanders are smart, interesting people and that this is just a dumb movie.",1350432000,3,1908,4.666666666666667
4960384,4,B00657PLN8,"Gabriel is a closeted teen who has confirms his sexuality for the first time with Marcus, a boy he is assigned to room with at a school trip to England.  Once back in his native Iceland, Gabriel is immediately caught up in the assorted dramas of his male and female friends, including a girl in search of her father, another girl rebelling from her domineering grandmother, and assorted alcohol-fueled situations.  But what really bothers Gabriel is that Marcus fits in better than him, partying and getting it on with the girls, which leads him into a depression that his divorced mother and father are concerned about.  Girls also pursue Gabriel, who tries to pretend interest but is not very successful at doing so. The problems faced by these teens may seem trivial to some, but one sad event points out that it is very important to those going through these issues.

Very well written and acted, though the similarity in appearance between some characters confused me a bit.  Mostly in Icelandic, but dialogue is easy to follow with English subtitles.  A positive ""coming of age"" message for those dealing with gay or straight teens who seem distracted.  Won several Edda Awards (Iceland's version of the Oscar), and popular at numerous international gay film festivals.  Not rated, would be an R for sexual content, no nudity.  I give it four stars out of five.",1348876800,2,1367,4.832618025751073
4960385,5,B00657PLN8,"Gabriel (Atli Oskar Fjalarsson)is slowly realising that he might be gay, he likes his female friends but has no compulsion to do any more than just `hang' with them. So on a summer English school to `sunny' Manchester he rooms up with outgoing and would be hairdresser, Markus (Haralder Ari Stefansson) and after a drunken party they share a kiss. It seems to mean more to Gabriel than Markus and on returning to Iceland his over bearing mother knows something has changed him. So like any caring but annoying mum she calls a family meeting. This involves a painful meeting with both real dad and step dad all trying to be overly PC whilst being border line stalkers.

We also have his best mate, hard drinking and womanising Teddi, who is the exact opposite of the caring thoughtful Gabriel. There are also the tales of his other friends especially Stella and Greta who all have familial and emotional issues which they invariably share with Gabriel in a trouble shared is a troubled halved kind of way. What actually happens is it becomes a trouble shared is a trouble doubled way instead.  One has an alcoholic loose moraled mother who won't tell her who her father is. The other is living with an over protective grandmother who doesn't want her to turn out like her mother. They spend their time planning for an uncertain future and having parties where copious amounts of alcohol are consumed as a prelude to non committal sex, except for Teddi (but not always).

There have been comparisons with `Skins' which is unfortunate as this most certainly is not. What director  Baldvin Zophoniasson has created is a multi layered tale of kids becoming adults and not really knowing what they are doing. This is a state we have all been through at that particular time in life. The gay strand is one of many issues that is dealt with along with identity, belonging and independence. And I must say there is a lot packed into this 93 minutes, so much so that I have seen it twice and it lost little of its impact on a second viewing.

It is slow in places and it can be said to be overly complicated in terms of breadth, but found it utterly absorbing and both well acted and filmed. I admire most world cinema and think that efforts like this should be applauded. There is little in the way of bedroom scenes as this is more about relationships and I do not think it suffers for it. A well made and presented film that deserves a lot more attention than it has currently received - highly recommended to fans of world cinema but not teen soft porn if that is your bag.",1339200000,18,2567,4.535637149028077
4960386,5,B00657PLN8,"Superb coming-of-age drama about an Icelandic teen who begins to come to terms with his sexuality after spending three weeks at an educational program in England. One of the many great things about this movie is that it puts the coming-out experience into the context of today, where coping with sexual feelings is but one of the many pressures that young people face. The director captures the teen social scene with remarkable believability (most of the film is set in Iceland but really could be taking place anywhere) and in doing so does not spare us any detail. The story takes a few harrowing turns but ultimately ends on a sweet and hopeful note. One of the best ""coming out"" films that I've seen in a long time.",1335052800,40,720,4.6328125
4960387,4,B00657PLN8,"The Icelandic title of this film, ri, actually translates as Turmoil, defined as ""a state or condition of extreme confusion, agitation, or commotion."" And that is a much better description of the contents of this film. We meet our teenage hero, Gabril, a straight shooter, as he participates in an ESL program in England, where he meets Marks, another Icelander, who has his brother's ID and introduces Gabril to drink, and it becomes clear, that the boys find comfort in each other, and perhaps some deeper feelings. Back in Iceland Gabril returns to his family with little to say about his trip, to the consternation of his mother. Meanwhile his gal pal is having boyfriend problems. All the kids party hardily with little adult supervision. After a robbery at the convenience store where she works, in which she is roughed up, she is befriended by co-worker, a Russian boy, Mitrovik, who is seen as an outsider even though he has lived in Iceland a long time. Her mother refuses to act like one, so her meddling grandmother, who sees it as her job to protect the girl's purity, ruins her life by stalking her.

***Spoiler Alert***

After we watch all this commotion, Marks reappears at another party and is quite cold towards Gabrel. He disappears with a girl, and when Gabrel goes looking for him he is found buck naked in the middle of sex with the girl. At this point Gabrel leaves in a state of ""extreme confusion, agitation, or commotion."" When his harassed, depressed girl friend commits suicide, the grandmother is sick with grief, but is embraced (and redeemed) by Mitrovik, who returns a cross necklace stolen in the robbery. Marks apologizes to Gabrel who then admits he wants to get to know Marks better, and the final scene shows a kiss between the two through an open doorway behind his parents who miss the embrace. At no point does either Gabrel or Marks show any jitters whatsoever.

Parts of the film may mimic the BBC Skins, in terms of the hard drinking, or The Secret Life of the American Teenager, in terms of the soap-opera nature of things, as suggested in the description, but Jitters is well acted by an age-appropriate cast. It is totally original if not totally believable. For that reason I recommend it.",1334793600,7,2235,4.740359897172237
4960388,5,B00657PLN8,Excellent experience,1436054400,,20,9.5
4960389,3,B00657PLN8,"Teen coming-out-of the-closet film with a lovable but benign central character. Kind of unrealistic lack of conflict in both his self awareness and the reactions of his family and peers. Also, not very complimentary of Icelanders, who all seem to be sex-obsessed alcoholic xenophobes (except our hero, who never goes beyond sharing a kiss with his main squeeze). Nonetheless, this film is better than most trite American films that attempt to grapple with this subject.",1426982400,,469,5.266666666666667
4960390,2,B00657PLN8,"The first fifteen minutes of this film earn it the two star ranking.  ""Jitters"" starts off well enough; two teenage males share a dorm room on an excursion to England.  Eventually, they share a kiss.  Cue the disastrous remainder of the movie with enough pathos and angst to fill a season of an MTV reality show.  I am so weary of the 'gay' film depicted as a maelstrom of confliction wherein young men are discovering they're gay, and the world en masse sets out to convince them they're straight.  The most damaged by the 'confliction' formula are women, who do everything in their might to reinvigorate the heterosexuality of the men they are desperate to be sleeping with.  The young women in ""Jitters"" are portrayed as promiscuous alcoholics who (in one case) are so forlorn about their existences without men that they turn to suicide.  This is the second 'gay' film I have seen wherein a woman commits suicide due to romance problems with a man (""Leo's Room"" being the one before ""Jitters"")
  If you are seeking specifically for a gay film, 90% of Jitters fails the litmus test.  On a final note, if you're wondering why I keep typing the word gay as 'gay', it's because every other frame the 'gay' young men are making out with women.",1426032000,3,1242,4.63013698630137
4960391,3,B00657PLN8,"I bought this movie because i was hungry for gay love, and yes, some gay sex.  All I saw, throughout the entire movie were 2 scenes, where the 2 young (hot) men, Gabriel and Markus, had any sex at all, and it was kissing only.  And this is even a foreign film!  There was hotter sex in Top Gun, a movie released to the general audience,  between Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis in the one scene at night, than there was in this  entire film.  The hottest sex through out this entire movie was some kissing, and then, way more heterosexual than homosexual.  Waaayyy more.  What gives?  Then at the end of the film, the 2 young men get back together again, and just as it looks like something real is going to happen, all they do is kiss out in the hall way.  The door flys open,  Gabriel's parents are having dinner, and he brings his 'lover'- friend Markus in to introduce him to his parents, and, and.... and, the movie ends.  No way i can give this movie 5 stars.  It was a let down.  I was hoping to see more gay love, especially in a movie that is advertised about ....  guess....  gay love.  the only reason i didn't go lower than 3 stars is because Gabriel and Markus were extremely hot.  i think the sex scenes (that weren't in this movie) would have been extremely hot, between the two.  too bad that we will never know.",1424131200,2,1326,4.232

Gabriel's problem is trying to deal with his feeling for Marcus, while trying to avoid discussing this with his mother who wants to know every detail of his life. At the same time he is interacting with his friends from childhood, helping them deal with their problems, yet keeping his problem hidden from them also.
