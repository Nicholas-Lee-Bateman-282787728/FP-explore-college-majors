8229135,5,B000XPXUDQ,"I have recently returned from a river cruise- Amsterdam to Bucharest- I traveled with a different company, some ports were different and some of the day trips different.  This gave me the opportunity to see what I missed by selecting different side trips and visiting different towns.  I was impressed with the explanation regarding the history of the locks and how they operate to take us over the mountainous area through the R M D canal  to join two great rivers that run in different directions.",1442275200,,499,4.77906976744186

8229137,4,B000XPXUDQ,"Delightful video.  Most of the video focuses on the journey itself, which is spectacular. Those portions devoted to showing the ship's accommodations are just enough. Seeing this video confirms that I would really like to take a river cruise through Europe when I can no longer do the hiking and biking I love to do.  I highly recommend buy this before making a decision as to whether or not a river cruise is right for you.  I have received videos from some of the river cruise companies, but they are too short and show to little of the beauty to be seen on such a cruise.",1368921600,,574,4.39622641509434
