2286568,5,B0009F2EPU,"As much as this production detracts from the teutonic tradition that Wagner designed the Ring for, this centenniary production of the Ring with Patrice Chereau as the director, Pierre Boulez as conductor, and Brian Large as the very talented producer, is possibly the best in the market.  No, it doesn't have a cast that has the dimension and experience of the Solti or Karajan rings, but without a doubt, it is the most visually engaging and dramatically correct rendition of Wagner's tetralogy.  Others would say that the Levine Ring provides the most traditional and faithful production with respect to Wagner's score, and I have no doubts that the sets used in the Met are very beautiful.  This set, however, changes the concept from a legendary setting of mountains and god-palaces to a more French social hierarchy environment.  The interpretation makes sense, but it isn't only this which makes this Ring come to life.  It is the involvement of a very talented conductor and a cast of marvelous singers which make this Ring a most memorable moment.

Donald McIntyre may not have Hans Hotter's great voice or James Morris' great bel canto interpretation of Wotan's role, but it certainly exudes a nobility and a richness absent from other recordings.  Gwyneth Jones is a marvelous Brunnhilde.  For her alone would I see this Ring day after day.  It is note perfect, powerful, and very dramatic.  I'd say that she has the best Brunnhilde overall of the ones I've heard.",1142208000,75,1474,4.931174089068826
2286569,4,B0009F2EPU,"The first part of this Ring I owned was Gotterdammerung. In that production I noticed that the story, the impact of the drama, was made by the staging of Patrice Chereau and the acting prestations in the first place followed by the vocal performances of the singers. A kind of the other around considering the premise of opera. Having seen all four parts of the Boulez-Ring I stay with that first impression. Expecially Gwyneth Jones and Donald McIntyre are far better actors then they are singers. Their voices cannot bare the weight of the drama required in Die Walkure Act 3 (Brunnhilde and Wotan) and Gotterdammerung Act 3 (Brunnhilde)for example.

The staging, however, is superb. The great thing from this production is that Chereau, not just ripped Wagners Ring from the old German mythology, but replaced it with a world that looks like a combination of Jules Verne and ancient Greek in which an insight in the characters and their motives are given in a way that I did not see before. It is as accessible as an average arthouse movie. Many modern staging just seem to want to get away from the old bearskins and teuton heroism so much that nothing else is offered instead (except leaving the audience with Brunnhilde looking like Christiane F.  for instance - Stuttgarter Opera). What I appreciated in the world of the Chereau Ring is it's own atmosphere and use of images and elements that are not just post-modern but also functional. The Wotan-monologue in Act 2 from Die Walkure and the love-duet from Act 3 between Siegfried and Brunnhilde are so cleverly directed that every line sung here is important instead of just asking time from the audience.

Another big plus for me is the conductorship of Pierre Boulez. Fast without rushing, modern with great insight, he lets the music do its work. Personally I prefer that very much over conductors who emphasis to much on the so called dramatic moments and by that destroying the natural flow of the music. With his approach Boulez shows us the richness of Wagners score, instead of converting it into something more one-dimensional.

This is a great Ring cycle and I think a great version to have if you are interested in owning a Ring on DVD.",1136246400,44,2206,4.767015706806283

Nonetheless laser disks can go bad with time, and this set may not always be available. Some people might criticize the costumes / lighting / staging. However the principal artists are top notch.

2286571,4,B0009F2EPU,"I was thinking Hans Hotter, as well, but McIntyre was no slouch and I found him more than acceptable in the role.

This Ring is one I bought some time ago and saved it: After all, one can only first experience something once. I was very taken with Siegmund and Sieglinde, and wish heartily she had been doing Brunnhilde,a role she had not performed at the time. The biggest flaw was Jones who did nothing but caterwaul and, as well, was underpitch.

Very taken with Manfred Jung, I found little about him, and that was written auf Deutsch... born in 1940, he was thirty-six for this performance. Sadly, I found he sang Mime on his only other recording (so far as I know). I thought he was really, really good, enough to satisfy my misplaced desire for Melchior with the fabulous voice, but a handful of other (forgivable} flaws. What always strikes me in more current Rings is the difficulty of digging in and moving about. Good heavens! Stand-and-sing is long gone; and while I'm glad of that, one has to be an athlete for some of the stagings in many of today's performances.

I have only three Ring videos and a goodly number of CDs (my favorite is the Furtwaengler with the Italian orchestra, and I thought it was only I who loved that recording, surprised when a number of persons on this forum had the same idea.

My favorite video for the staging is the Met's (Jerusalem was sick and Behrens was past it). Oddly, I like The Copenhagen Ring, although it's singers are all but useless, but the acting was good. Yeah, I know: It's opera, so who cares about the acting? It has much to recommend it if you're not hide-bound with tradiation or imprinted with the best performance you've ever experienced. Now I'm going to see if I can find another Ring video, one can never have too many good to great performances of anything.

And whilst I'm here, if the latest met Ring is on video, I shall be the last person to buy it. Voigt alone turns me off; just another caterwauler, which proves just how difficult - impossible - it is to find Wagnerians of any stripe. Having said that, I have Gerald Finley's Sachs and I'm saving that, as well. I'm flat-out crazy about Gerald Finley: His Argante alone...",1363478400,5,2201,4.5201005025125625

2286575,3,B0009F2EPU,"I remember watching this Boulez/Chreau Ring when it was broadcast (!) on American tv (!!) around 1981 or 82.  I was glued to the tv for 4 nights as this visually arresting and musically compelling cycle unfolded.  This was before the era of video taping so I did not see this production again until it was released on commercial videos several years later.  I was less smitten by this event than before, noticing a few flops in the production and being more critical of some of the singing, though I liked Boulez's conducting more than I had before.  I have a set of recordings from the premiere season (1976) with a very different cast of singers and a very disgruntled orchestra which played pretty crudely for Boulez who they did not like at all.
The eruption of hissing and booing at the start of Act 3 of Gtterdmmerung was really shocking to me.  The audience was expressing HATRED for the hydroelectric dam appearing again, something they had expected to be finished with after the opening scene of Rheingold.  It's reappearance was too much for them and they erupted.

Now it is all very mild.  By the end of the run in this production was greeted with cheers of approval.  How fickle public opinion is.  It is refreshing to see new viewpoints expressed in telling Wagner's mythological epic but,sadly, things have gone off the rails with the ascendence of the 'Konzept' producers who are more interested in themselves than Wagner, or us.

Chreau and Harry Kupfer were the granddaddies of Konzept productions.  Whereas Kupfer slid into a rut of predictable imagery Chreau has continued to grow in a more a imaginative fashion, note his 'From the House of the Dead' currently showing at the Met.  It's modern and bleak but so is the story.  Some of the other current wunderkinds of Konzept productions could easily have set Janacek's opera in a grocery store or shopping mall or something like that.  Chreau has more self-control, and sense.

His early Ring at Bayreuth is a sensible production within the framework of non-traditional settings for Wagner's masterpieces.  And he does not offend, but the original illusion of sure-footedness has started to crack and the production now looks slightly gimcrack.

The sets are beautiful and the direction of the singers is tightly controlled but not so tight as to thwart freedom of movement, especially with some of the better singer-actors like Gwyneth Jones' Brnnhilde and Hermann Becht's Alberich.

Overall the singing is very good, if not in the same league as the casts from Bayreuth's Golden Age of the 1950s and early 1960s when Wieland Wagner was hiring the best possible singers from around the world.  By the 1980s things had deteriorated in that department and Wagnerians found themselves settling for make-do singers and conductors, with the occasional brilliant production, notably 'Der fliegende Hollnder' in the late '70s.

I mention Gwyneth Jones right off the bat because she is the star of this production.  Many complain about her vocal inconsistencies but I hear a soprano who has the measure of this huge part, and the voice to sing it and, even more of an asset, a great theatrical sense and ability to express it in her fine acting.  She is the main reason to see this production on film.  There are other important performances in this show, notably the Siegmund and Sieglinde of Peter Hofmann (his world debut for all intents and purposes) and Jeannine Altmeyer.  Act 1 of Walkre is white hot, though the staging is pretty disappointing, beyond their impassioned embraces which are very convincing, almost blush-making.

Matti Salminen makes his international debut as the giant Fasolt.  Sadly the giants' costumes are one of the glaring failures of this production, but Salminen and Fritz Hbner sing through these impediments with great power.  Salminen's Hunding is one of the great vocal assumptions of this role on record (film) and his performances are another compelling, if comparatively minor reason to view these films.  Hermann Becht is an outstanding Alberich, vocally and histrionically.  And Heinz Zednik's Loge carries the first opera almost solely upon his shoulders, which are draped in a long white sheet.
The other great singing comes from Ortrun Wenkel's Erda.

Donald McIntyre is a good Wotan, within the limitations of his less-than-Wagnerian baritone.  It's an attractive voice, he's an attractive man and he fits perfectly into Chreau's Konzept as the 19th century landed gentleman/god who is stricken by a guilty conscience for his treachery against the working classes (Chreau took G.B. Shaw's book 'The Perfect Wagnerite' to heart and has based this production on that Marxist point of view and hatred for the aristocracy).

There is one galvanizing moment, in particular, that has stuck in my mind since the first time I saw it; the moment in the last act of Walkre when Wotan scoops the sleeping Brnnhilde up into his arms where she dangles limply like a dead child. It is a deeply moving moment.  The singing up to this point in this cycle has been of a consistently high level.

It is with the last two operas that problems begin to intrude with the cast.  Manfred Jung sings well but he was a disappointment compared to the original Siegfrieds in this production (who quit after the first season), Ren Kollo and Jess Thomas.  Jung had a nice, strongish lyric tenor and he pushes enough to be credible in the louder moments, like the Forging Scene, but he is pushed to the limits and it shows.  He's an unusual looking man, not unattractive, just unusual, the one-browed type (not an inapposite thing for a Siegfried) but he also exudes the air of a certified accountant that is out of tune with his primitive character.  He's a make-do singer who does not detract but neither does he satisfy.  He's also a mediocre actor.  Heinz Zednik's vivid Mime saves the first act of Siegfried with his lively and subtly nuanced performance.

The casting of Gtterdmmerung is good if not outstanding.  Franz Mazura stands out as Gunther and Jeannine Altmeyer is luxury casting as Gutrune.  Fritz Hbner is not in the same league as the original Hagen (Karl Ridderbusch, who also quit after the first season) but he does what he can, hobbled a bit by the Konzept of the Gibichungs being a parvenu family of rich businessmen, Plutocractic peers if you will.

There are some gorgeous sets by Peduzzi; notably the 2nd scene of Rheingold with its sunken columns and giant clock, the 3rd act of Walkre with the Pironesi-like broken wall upon which Brnnhilde is lain to rest, and the forest in Siegfried with the toy-like dragon hauled by stagehands (something you wouldn't think would work but it does).  I also happened to like the hydroelectric dam that the Rhine Daughters frolic upon in their glad rags.  It's a powerful, potent image that evokes great masses of water and was, at the time, a relief from the usual dark green rocky riverbed with 3 middle-aged singers attempting to allure by waving their arms and jumping around all over the place.  These 3 prostitute daughters are more dignified than that, and therefore sing more in-tune than the usual lot.

Boulez is a swift Wagnerian, occasionally a bit glib, but he doesn't gloss over the profound bits, he simply eschews lingering in the often somnolent manner of James Levine.

Having seen this film again 30 years after the tv broadcast I have to say that I wouldn't spend the money on the dvds.  What I did instead was to go to Ebay and snag an original un-opened set of the lps that came in that red and black cardboard carrying case just before the era of the cd blew vinyl out of the stores.  I think listening is the best way to experience this good performance as the production becomes more of an incumbrance, unlike the theater of my mind.",1258675200,33,7801,4.849056603773585
2286576,3,B0009F2EPU,"The rot set in when opera house managers realized that there was a profitable link between embracing ""new"" artistic concepts of staging and saving money.
In the 70s, Chereau's production was widely seen as a new low - we were not supposed to see through the crass ""updating"" of Wagner's stunning adventure into the cost-cutting exercise which it really was. We were supposed to admire Chereau's bold vision and then shut our eyes to the reality.
But the worst of it is that the next generation, the disciples of such worldly gurus, use their ""revolutionary"" teachers as role models in order to misunderstand Wagner's basic premises even further, building careers solely upon the basis of saving money. Opera house managers just love them, of course, quite unaware of what they have lost.
I repeat: Wagner's work is an ADVENTURE into the depths of nature and of humanity, to be experienced on its author's terms.
When he said to his offspring: ""Kinder, schafft Neues!"" (""Children, create anew!"") he was expressing the hope that his work would not become fossilized to the point where it would only exist as a museum piece.
He was NOT trying to encourage them to pluck a fish out of water and watch to see how long it would take to die.
Others before Chereau began the process of plucking Wagner's adventure out of its natural environment, but this year's Bayreuth Festival must represent some sort of consummation of this process. There is no adventure, nature or humanity left - only a cynical addiction to the idea of ""updating"", so that everything great, everything beautiful and everything honest about Wagner's endeavours in the face of ceaseless opposition and financial difficulty has been removed - along with everything expensive, of course.
We are now left with an up-to-date corpse. The very last thing the poor composer would have wanted.
Thank Heaven for audio CDs which still allow those of us with imagination to see into his world!
That said, I love listening to the Chereau DVD discs - the sound is lovely, if too obviously compressed at times, and Boulez is transparent and perceptive, however slick he may seem to some ears.",1256688000,9,2142,4.887362637362638

2286578,4,B0009F2EPU,"This Bayreuth centennial production of Wagner's Ring is historically one of the most celebrated and scandalous in the entire history of the festival. It's strengths and weaknesses have been well documented for over thirty years, from the controversial staging by a young filmmaker to the consistancy (or lack of) of the cast.

Although the cast is a group of some of the best Wagnerians at time, it is sometimes painfully obvious that not every generation has a Nilsson/Flagstad/Melchior caliber of singer, but over all the music is served well. Gwyneth Jones in particle was inconsitant vocally, her upper register at times sounding worn, flapping in the breeze uncontrollably. On a good day however, she could sing like an absolute goddess. Here she is NOT a goddess, but her high notes don't flap either....at least not too much. Her strongest point in this production is her stage acting...she is intense and unashamedly committed to Chereau's direction. Her Siegfried, Manfred Jung, is serviceable and not much more, which isn't neccesarily a bad thing considering the demands of the role. Jung also stepped in at the last minute a few years later and saved the Solti/Hall Ring when Reiner Goldberg fizzled out. Also notable is a young Peter Hoffman as Siegmund near the start of his short operatic career. Overall the singers may not be great, but they are good.

Chereau's Marxist 19th century setting is definitely not to everyone's taste, but at least he has specific ideas that work, for good or bad.

While Chereau's direction is cutting edge and exciting, it is Brian Large's camera work that is the major flaw in this set. He has been called the most musical video director today with a keen eye for detail, but detail can be nothing and even destroy art if you miss the forest for the trees. To completely ignore the entire production because of a fascination with the second tenor from the left, or to ignore Desdemona's death just to get an extreme close-up of Placido Domingo's right eye and nostril, or to edit out the end of Don Carlos because we have to see Nicolai Ghiaurov in close up pining away, is downright heinous. While close ups add to the theatrical experience when done correctly at appropriate times, it should NOT be done at the expense of the entire production. At times I wish they had set up a single camera dead center with the entire stage in view...and left it alone. It is absolutely maddening to be forced for eternity to watch a small fraction of the drama with a flicker of flame in the corner of the screen, or obvious stage action just off-camera. Thank heavens Mr. Large didn't direct something like Ben-Hur or no one would ever know who won the chariot race since the camera would be zoomed in on some Judean Noble-person in row 47.

Overall, this is a memorable document of one of the high points in Bayreuth's controversial history, permantly marred by subjectively selective camera work.",1207353600,12,2937,4.821428571428571

8059879,5,B0009F2EPU,"Patrice Chreaus legendary 1976 centenary production of Wagners mammoth tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen was one of the theatrical events of the 20th century and this DVD set (recorded in 1980) is a mandatory purchase for all Wagnerians. For once Deutsche Grammophons sales spiel does not lie. Just like Stravinskys Rite of Spring decades earlier, this staging caused a riot when it was first seen, the Bayreuth audience split right down the middle in their hatred/love of what Chreau had done to their beloved Ring. Though there had been important precursors (Joachim Herzs 1973 Leipzig production for one), Chreau confidently jumped off in a fresh direction directing the cycle in a way that had never been seen before at Bayreuth. The fact that he did so in such an accomplished way (if it was technically shoddy it would have been easier to dismiss) at the very shrine of Planet Wagner sent shock waves across the world and changed Wagner production (and arguably opera production in toto) forever.

It was Chreau who more than any other introduced into the modern conscience (his ideas actually go back through Giorgio Strehler to Walter Felsenstein in the 1930s-40s and then to Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig at the turn of the century) the idea of regietheater (directors theater) to an art-form which had hitherto been the domain of traditional naturalistic/realistic obeisance to composers stage directions. On seeing Chreaus desecration traditionalists clamored to have their naturalistic Ring returned to them and Bayreuth duly obliged in 1983 with Peter Halls faithful, but ill-fated rendering. Then there was the New York Wagner style inaugurated by Otto Schenk, his 1989 Ring held up as a model production by some, but decried as a sterile museum piece with absolutely nothing to say by others. Regietheater (or produceritis as detractors call it) on the other hand has continued unabated with sometimes outstanding, but often ridiculous results, especially at Bayreuth. The last three shock at all costs Ring productions have barely turned a head, the fact that you could still buy tickets for this years cycle on the net even after the festival had started telling its own story as director-centered ego-trips continue to drive audiences away. In truth Chreau has a lot to answer for, but from where I sit there is obviously good traditional Ring production (Nikolaus Lehnhoff, San Francisco 1990) and bad (Schenk), just as there is good regietheater Ring production (Kupfer, Bayreuth 1988) and bad (La Fura dels Baus, Barcelona, 2007). An open mind is what is required. For me the Chreau is an example of top quality regietheater which works almost perfectly. It should be noted that at Bayreuth the volatility of its hostile reception was matched by the warmth of the 90-minute standing ovation it received at the end of its final performance in 1980.

Its perhaps hard for audiences now to understand the furor surrounding Chreaus production. There have been so many weird and wonderful stagings of the Ring since that the Chreau now looks decidedly old-fashioned and is probably the regietheater production that traditionalists will like the most. In the tradition of Felsenstein Chreau pays attention throughout to the text as sung, and also respects Wagners stage directions a lot more than is given credit for. We are given the Rhine, proper giants, Alberich turning into a proper wurm and then frog, a neo-classical Valhalla, a factory floor Nibelheim, real forest settings, a romantic mountain top quasi-Greek temple Valkyrie rock, a huge dragon wheeled around on stage and a neo-classical Gibichung hall set on the shore of the Rhine. Magic fire traditionally envelops the Valkyrie rock and the tetralogy closes with an immolation of real flames with Valhalla clearly burning in the background. Wagner would have recognized this Ring and outwardly there would appear to be not a lot to complain about.

However, place Chreaus production in the context of every Bayreuth Ring production that had preceded it and the grounds for complaint become obvious. Since the re-opening of the festival in 1951 there had been four different productions, two each by Wagners grandsons  Wieland (1951 and 1965) and Wolfgang (1960 and 1970). All four had emphasized the mythic timelessness of the piece with an abstraction that had contrasted markedly with the naturalism of the three pre-war productions that had also been directed by members of the Wagner family (Wagner himself, his widow Cosima and their son Siegfried) and the 1933-42 Heinz Tietjen cycle. The post-war New Bayreuth Entrmpelung (clearing out the attic) style served the double purpose of de-politicizing Wagner (ie; stripping it of those naughty Nazi trappings) as well as returning to the ideas of Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig wherein the stage is stripped of inessentials and the central dramatic idea is honed in on and emphasized along with character psychology. For Wieland in particular it was important to return Wagner to his roots and his origins in ancient Greek tragedy. In his productions characters were turned into virtual Greek statues which combined with the spare treatment of the mise-en-scne to make for music drama which moved the audience primarily through a combination of the music and the ambiguity of time and space. Detractors accused Wieland of turning his grandfathers music dramas into oratorios, but it is now accepted that the Entrmpelung style was one ideal way of producing Wagner. Many people in that first night audience for Chreaus Ring remembered Wieland and Wolfgangs productions fondly and what they now saw amounted to downright provocation.

For Chreau social context was everything and he flouted all convention by setting the Ring squarely in the modern age of an industrializing European society. Das Rheingold is set in the late 18th century pre-industrial world, Die Walkre in the stage of early capitalism with Hunding the first entrepreneur/factory owner, Siegfried in the age of 19th century industrialism, and Gtterdmmerung in the interwar period of fascist capitalism. The pin-pointing of time and place tells us that Chreau is trying to reflect the very world that Wagner himself lived in, and also that far from characters being gods, giants and dwarfs, actually they all represent different aspects of the human species. In this respect Chreaus basic concept (though he denied ever having one as such) is undoubtedly Shavian. George Bernard Shaw argued in The Perfect Wagnerite that the Ring is centrally an allegory on the collapse of capitalism from its internal contradictions with the world of Man waiting for a hero to cleanse away the lame and cramped government of the godsReally, of course, the dwarfs, giants and gods are dramatizations of the three main orders of men: to wit, the instinctive, predatory, lustful, greedy people; the patient, toiling, stupid, respectful, money-worshipping people; and the intellectual, moral, talented people who devise and administer States and Churches. History shows us only one order higher than the highest of these: namely, the order of Heroes. Chreau with his set designer Richard Peduzzi and costume designer Jacques Schmidt set about stripping the gods of their nobility and making all the characters as close to man (to the very people sitting in the audience) as possible with a clear emphasis on the old story of capitalism encapsulated in the pursuit of power wherein the key characters destroy everything including themselves to get what they want. This left wing socialist message was of course outrageous to the right wing Bayreuth audience who (with more than a little justification!) saw the production as an attack on themselves, a point driven home most of all in Gtterdmmerung act 2 when Siegfried wears black tie, ostensibly to resemble Gunther the weak industrialist who is used by the arch-fascist Hagen, but also of course to resemble the gentlemen of the audience also in black tie and also cogs in (what socialists see as) a fascist machine.

The pursuit of power through capitalism is emphasized throughout the production with the presence of giant factory wheels half-exposed on the stage side. The opening of Das Rheingold is the very image of man abusing nature to generate power in the hydro-electric dam run by the gold lying beneath it. Theres no depiction of ideally clean nature here, the idea of the Rhinemaidens innocent virginity going for nothing. Chreau turns them into Toulouse-Lautrec whores with Alberichs head up one of their skirts presenting sex as both erotic and sordid  an alternative power source to gold. Alberich stealing the gold is very much second best to the power of sexual love which he has to foreswear as part of the deal. This scene was hugely provocative to an audience used to seeing nature pure and unsullied before the arrival of Alberich, though it is in the text (if not the stage directions!) that nature has been violated before the Ring starts with Wotan tearing down a branch from the world ash tree and going on to fashion a spear with the rules by which he seeks to rule the world. These rules have made nature subservient to man (perfectly visualized by the dam and the prostitute Rhinemaidens), and especially subservient to the talented people who devise and administer States and Churches who we meet in the very next scene  Wotan and his fellow gods. Dressed in late 18th century finery and performing on a metal factory-like stage floor with those huge wheels to the side and the finished neo-classical Valhalla (based on Haus Wahnfried, Wagners Bayreuth home) in the background, the gods deal with the giants in the manner of a modern day business transaction. The descent to Nibelheim is a descent to the proletarian factory floor, the split class setting reminiscent of Fritz Langs Metropolis.

Deeply shocking was the violence of the raw physicality on display  Wotan hacking the ring off Alberichs finger with blood visible, Fafner bashing his brother to death with his bare hands, and so the provocation goes throughout Chreaus production. In Die Walkre Hundings hut is a fancy bourgeois establishment adjacent to a factory with the owner an entrepreneur surrounded by henchmen who later corner Siegmund for him to spear nastily through the testicles (the place which had violated his wife Sieglinde) with not one, but several malevolent stabs. Siegfried act 1 is centered round a factory forge with a mechanical contraption moving of its own accord as the sword is made a-new. Wotan would appear to be behind this as he is behind the caged wood-bird planted deliberately to guide Siegfried in act 2. This violates Wagners idea of Siegfried being a free hero, but it does accentuate the idea of the Wlsung race personifying Wotans will. By the time it came to Gtterdmmerung many in the first night audience had had enough. Siegfrieds seizing of the ring from Brnnhilde is viciously presented almost like a rape. The depiction of the Gibichungs uncomfortably close to themselves was the ultimate insult to the audience and when the arch fascist Hagen rammed his spear into Siegfrieds back repeatedly with sadistic relish many members of the audience yelled out, Genug! [Enough!] Many later productions have been even more violent and transgressive to the point that audiences these days watch expecting it. But in 1976 this was all new and incendiary for conservative audiences used to watching a different world disconnected from the twisted everyday realities we are all familiar with. Throughout Chreau denies us the Greek statuary of Wieland Wagner as well as the fairy tale winged helmets, robes and tunics of Norse mythology, forcing us instead to rub our noses in Our own dirty little corner. (Tom Sutcliffe).

Alongside the provocation though Chreau gives us a series of quite wonderfully-lit sets which provide for any number of arresting and deeply memorable stage pictures. The use of spotlights is particularly inspired, especially the strong beam drilling into Alberich and the stage beneath his feet as he curses the ring. The Todesverkndigung forest setting in Die Walkre act 2 is wonderfully atmospheric with soft light contrasting with the otherworldly haloes surrounding Siegmund and Brnnhilde which plays with a huge white sheet draped over the doomed hero in a moment of genius. The preceding Wotan/Brnnhilde encounter is also deeply impressive set in a Valhalla drawing room (not Wagners mountain top!) dominated by a huge Foucaults pendulum which Wotan stops on Das Ende!! at the end of his monolog delivered to his reflection in a giant full-length mirror which he covers with his coat because he can no longer bare the sight of himself. Best of all is the Valkyrie rock modeled after Arnold Bcklins The Isle of the Dead which for once suggests the right kind of ambiguity of both time and place. Like many of the scenes, Wotans act 3 farewell is intensely romantic as is the astonishing last scene of Gtterdmmerung with one of the most convincingly satisfying immolations in my experience, Valhalla burning movingly in the background.

Im not entirely convinced that a worthy Ring can strip away the timeless mythology and still work and I would agree with detractors in saying Chreau narrows the meaning of the tetralogy down too much. The Ring may be an anti-capitalist rant, but it is obviously about much more than that. By seizing on one textual reading Chreau loses sight of all the others. And yet, the romantic stage pictures he provides combine superbly with an astonishingly high degree of quality acting to completely carry us away and convince us that this is a truly great Ring. Chreau (now sadly no longer with us) was a true man of the theater who believed in long periods of intensive rehearsal between actors leading to the finished result which is both psychologically convincing and completely real. He reduces all the characters of the Ring to mortals, but he makes them feel for and against each other in a way that in 1976 was extremely rare in the opera house. That was the most important ingredient of Chreaus revolutionary take on Wagner, namely the introduction of serious theater into opera production which had hitherto been a matter of outdated static convention. All the central relationships (Wotan/Fricka, Alberich/Mime, Siegmund/Sieglinde, Wotan/Brnnhilde, Siegfried/Mime, Siegfried/Brnnhilde) are superbly drawn with singers basically becoming their characters for the time they are before us. The erotic abandon between the Wlsungs in Die Walkre is extraordinarily intense and giddily romantic, while Wotans farewell to Brnnhilde is a matter of great tenderness and held-in passion. Siegfried/Mime make an inspired comic double act in Siegfried act 1 and those intricate little encounters in act 2 are done with obvious relish by all. The awakening of Brnnhilde and the opulence of the closing duet is outstandingly rendered in that fabulous set as is the Gtterdmmerung prologue love music farewell. Possibly the greatest single span of music in the Ring is Gtterdmmerung act 2 and Chreau makes it superbly gripping, the setting combining with the way the singers react around each other to pitch-perfect electrifying effect. On a personal romantic level this Ring leaves almost all other productions for dead. The only other production on DVD that betters it for me is the Kupfer/Barenboim 1991/92 Bayreuth version which takes off from Chreau in the fabulous movement of the singers and their acting, but in a setting (the famous worlds highway) which effectively returns the Ring to timeless mythology where it rightfully belongs. One thing Chreau does do better though is the final immolation scene which is overwhelming in its effect. Kupfers ending is a disappointing whimper beside it, but on virtually all other points, he scores over Chreau. This is especially true of the singing.

Musically alas, the Chreau Ring is flawed, but it is better I would say than any Ring coming after it except for the Kupfer production. Pierre Boulez was Wieland Wagners surprise choice to conduct Parsifal in 1966 and it was Boulez who recommended Chreau for the centenary Ring a decade later. As with Parsifal (one of the fastest readings ever in the Festspielhaus) Boulez zips through the Ring very quickly blowing away the cobwebs with an extraordinary passion which belies his cold analytic reputation. The orchestra rebelled against him in 1976, but by 1980 they had been won over and on these DVDs we hear a wonderful blend which is much closer to Karl Bhm (1966) than it is to Barenboim (1992). The problems come with the singing which is uneven. There are no problems with the Nibelungs and the giants, all four voices commanding the sound picture as they should. Hermann Becht is an outstanding if not obviously evil Alberich, Heinz Zednik excels as his slippery brother Mime and steals the show completely in Das Rheingold as Loge. Hes the link between Gerhard Stolze and Graham Clark as great Bayreuth Loge/Mimes. Matti Salminen and Fritz Hbner make perfect baleful black as black giants. Salminen is my favorite Hunding on record while Hbner dominates the stage as Hagen with superb malevolence. The Wlsungs make a very good looking pair, Peter Hoffman singing with heroic ardor and making those cries of Wlse! long and spine-tingling. Jeannine Altmeyer is a slightly unsteady Sieglinde (not ideally pure of tone) and makes for a wobbly Gutrune. Hanna Schwarz is a biting Fricka, firm and decisive (her appearance in Walkre act 2 is a highlight). The biggest problems come with the biggest roles and as they are on stage the longest, this is a serious flaw. I have to say that I cant be completely objective about this recording. This was my first Ring, the one I listened to on LP endlessly as a teenager pouring over the libretti with an enthusiasm I can barely muster now. Inside me Donald McIntyre, Manfred Jung and Gwyneth Jones have always been my Wotan, Siegfried and Brnnhilde, and I love their performances deeply, but when I later discovered the best Ring recordings of the 50s and 60s (Bhm, Krau, Knappertsbusch especially) I realized the shortcomings of what I had been used to. McIntyres Wotan is of the noble type, ideal for Das Rheingold, but ill-equipped to reveal the complexities we see in Die Walkre let alone the world weary bitterness of the Wanderer in Siegfried. His voice is soft, sometimes underpowered and never less than dignified, but he doesnt capture Wotan in his fullness, underplaying the requisite anger, frustration and sadness. On record for me only Hermann Uhde, Hans Hotter and later John Tomlinson give the whole picture. Manfred Jung would be welcomed today as a savior among heldentenoren, but sadly the microphones reveal his less than heroic tone and a tendency to shout which must qualify a gallant effort. He gives much pleasure, but cannot get to the places Siegfried Jerusalem let alone Wolfgang Windgassen could. Perhaps of all the cast Jung is the most affected by Boulez's swift tempi. Jerusalem by the way cameos effectively here as Froh. Dame Gwyneth alas is the biggest problem for me, a wildly unpredictable voice spreading at the top and wobbling at the bottom. As a teenager I was astonished by her and thought her singing of the love duets and then the immolation was extraordinary, but when I later heard Birgit Nilsson, Astrid Varnay and Martha Mdl I realized what I had been missing. One thing does remain with me about Dame Gwyneth and that is the way she sings Ruhe, ruhe, du Gott! [Rest now o god!] in her immolation scene. That sends shivers up my spine in a way that no other singer ever has or probably ever will!

A mandatory Ring for all Wagnerians then, its a legendary production well worth paying close attention to. Chreaus direction is outstanding in every way. Musically its not as great, but then I don't think its as bad as some have said, and certainly on DVD only the Kupfer/Barenboim betters it. Finally I should mention that the aspect ratio is 4:3 as this comes from the days before wide screen. The images have been cleared up by remastering but ghosting is still inevitable in scenes where light and dark are contrasted in extremes. There are no problems with the sound which is full, bright and beautifully radiates that amazing Bayreuth glow - one of the great wonders of the musical world.

The Solti set is orchestrally more exciting, the Karajan set is more majestic, but more chamber-orchestrally oriented. The singing is best in the Krauss set, but the sound reproduction is worst (from 1953!). The choice of singers in this set is more in keeping with the visual aspects of the set. The choices are very good and the overall production is convincing in every way. In some passages the orchester overpowers the singers.

Otherwise I would give it one star, because the production is ugly and ridiculous. Example: at the end of Gotterdammerung, Brunnhilde jumps into a bonfire on the street while a crowd of people in 19th century clothing wander about aimlessly. No Valhalla burning, just a group of sheep like people standing around with blank looks on their faces while smoke billows out from a street corner. However, this isn't the worst ring on DVD. The Barenboim Ring is worse. A really ridiculous production with a poor cast. But the absolute worst DVD is the recent Met ""Machine"" Ring. That one is dreadful. The best Ring on DVD is the Met Levine Ring from the 1990's. That is a superb production with perfect settings and wonderful performances.",1451433600,,863,4.917808219178082

8059885,5,B0009F2EPU,"I don't commonly give five stars; for that rating the album/production has to be memorable. That's the case here.  I can't claim to be an expert Wagnerian - indeed, hard core Wagner devotees kind of give me the creeps.  I can only say that the musical side of the production appeared to me to be perfectly well executed.

It is the dramatic aspect of this production that truly stands out. And I'm not talking only about Patrice Chereau's controversial (then, not now) staging.  The TV production also deserves a lot of praise: this was a no-expense-spared effort that simply would not be seen in the 21st-century's more straitened environment.  Under Brian Large's experienced and educated directorship, the camerawork is excellent, no doubt aided by the absence of an audience.  In fact it is hard to believe that this is an early-1980s production; I've seen far more primitive stage-to-TV opera productions from the 1990s and even this century.  And the cast adapt very well for the cameras.  Donald McIntyre in particular thrives on the small screen conveying a weak and conflicted Wotan.  Sieglinde (Jeannine Altmeyer) and Siegmund (Peter Hofmann) are red hot, Heinz Zednik is an excellent Loge (Das Rheingold) and Mime (Siegfried) and Franz Mazura's portrayal of a 423-year-old Gunther is most effective.

I forked out A$135 for this - even though it seems to be on Youtube for free - and I don't regret it at all.",1439683200,6,1420,4.928571428571429

But actually, performance-wise, vocally and orchestrally, it's superior to the Levine.  So am I saying overall, the stage decoration is more important than the voices and orchestra?  Hm, interesting quandary!",1406246400,3,457,4.87012987012987
