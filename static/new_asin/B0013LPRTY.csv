8251766,4,B0013LPRTY,"Since I've been a fan of Charlton Heston's ever since I was a stary eyed high school student who couldn't believe her good luck when he answered my fan letter in connection with his performance in The President's Lady, I do like this DVD.
It's a bit short and could include some examples of his own interviews as well as words from his son Fray Heston.
In other words, more of the same would be great.",1318032000,5,401,4.2894736842105265

8251768,4,B0013LPRTY,"The recent passing of Charlton Heston this April is a sincere loss for Hollywood. The actor took on characters larger than life and somehow made them accessible to a generation of moviegoers.  Moses, Michaelangelo, Andrew Jackson, El Cid, Ben Hur---Heston brought these historical icons to life physically and intellectually--and spoke to the hero in all of us.

Although rather short, this is a fine disc in which to savor Heston's greatest and most unforgettable moments on the screen.  All the classics are included here as well as the actor's personal favorite, Tom Gries' ""Will Penny,"" (1968). For fans of the actor, or if you wish to learn more about Hollywood's ""greatest generation,"" this DVD is a celebration of an actor who gave the Hollywood epic stature, fire, and guts.",1208476800,27,782,5.046511627906977
