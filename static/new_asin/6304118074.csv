7863838,3,6304118074,"I enjoyed watching the Tex Rides with the Boy Scouts, because I am a scoutmaster.  I try to find all the boy scout movies, and shows I can.  The quality of the picture is not good, because it was transferred from an old film.  The other video Song of the Gringo has nothing to do with scouts, so my interest was not in watching it at all.  I would recommend this video if you love westerns or are into scouting.",984182400,5,411,4.1
