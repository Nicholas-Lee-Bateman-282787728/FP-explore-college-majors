When you read the book the language of this famous humorist does not permit you to stop laughing - and the problem of this film is that you can't even start laughing due to the absolutely idiotic scenario which is though basically follows the main line of the book shortens all dialogues and situations in such a way that it looks like you get just the contents of the book in a nut shell...
The film producers flopped it though the actors tried to do their best in many ways looking like their characters.
Besides, DVD was stopping from time to time being produced with errors.
Do not buy it ever!",1353628800,5,669,4.403225806451613
