6437207,5,B00KOW49OM,"Perhaps my anticipation got the best of me, but this latest ""Margot"" was less a revelation than I had hoped for. Don't get me wrong-- it's still my favorite movie of the last thirty years, and well worth having, but once you do have it, you might want to check out the prior French version, a two-disc Pathe release from, I believe, 2007. It contains further deleted material, all quite worthwhile, and a wonderful conversation between Chereau and Daniele Thompson, among other things. The version of the film shown is pretty much the same as the one here, and granted, with a bit less clarity, but without the annoyingly reconfigured music cues, too. There are still a couple of scenes-- not much more than shots, really-- to be found on other versions, but perhaps Chereau found them ultimately prurient. Being no mean fan of prurience, I regret their exclusion. With films I love as much as this one, more, for me, is always more. This cut, though, was apparently Chereau's lastmost take on the thing, and is thus, I suppose, to be respected. I still, though, damn me, find the analogue sources more alluring in general, although there are moments when the resolution of this latest mastering makes one gasp anew. There are others, though, when the ""digitalization"" looks just like that sounds. I used to groan at those lamentations on the ""warmer"" sound of vinyl, but this is something like that. I might indeed come to love this, and I stoutly and with profound gratitude salute the Cohens for bringing it to us. We are truly lucky to have them in our midst, and I hope they sell a kazillion copies. And now I'm going to change my four stars to five, thank you, but why, doggone it, now that we have that great final line available to us, render ""sourire sur levres""  as merely ""smiling"" ? Especially given lips like Adjani's?  hfs",1409097600,7,1836,4.66358024691358
6437208,5,B00KOW49OM,"Although the Cohen website for the 4K Queen Margot says it has never been seen, it appears to be the longer cut that as issued on a German DVD, entitled Die Bartholomusnacht (Collector's Edition, 3 DVDs) . The Cohen running time is 159.  The German DVD running time is 164.  The difference is due, I suspect, to the slower speed of PAL, not to a shorter cut. The shorter cut on the German DVD runs 138 minutes.

6437209,5,B00KOW49OM,"INCLUDED BELOW ARE BRIEF NOTES ON THE MANY VARYING RUN TIMES AND VERSIONS -- INCLUDING FRENCH DIGI BOOK VS U.S. COHEN RELEASE

RESTORED RELEASE IS STUNNING.  Pathe has conducted a 4K restoration of this French classic which is being released on Cohen Media in the US. The current Pathe and Cohen releases are essentially identical for the movie itself.  More on the French digi-book release below.

THE PLOT: This 1994 film based on the Alexandre Dumas novel of the same name are set on the events surrounding the marriage of Catherine de Medici's Catholic daughter Marguerite (Margot) to Protestant Henri de Bourbon. It has been just two years, almost to the day, since an uneasy peace was brokered between the Catholics and the Huguenots (Calvinist Protestants) over political control of France. Catherine has arranged the marriage in order to promote peace between the Catholics and Protestants. However, tensions are high in Catholic Paris which is now crowded with protestants in town for the wedding. Margot and Henri are not in love and form a sort of partnership while each seek their own lovers, even on their wedding day. Just days after the wedding, an infamous event follows that is a bloody chapter in the history of France called the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. A plan to murder visiting protestants is hatched and rioting takes over the streets of Paris. The movie quotes 6,000 dead though modern research states anywhere from 5,000 to 30,000 counting the weeks that followed. Protestants visiting the royal wedding would have represented many of the wealthy and powerful class of Huguenots.

MORE ON RESTORATION FOR THIS RELEASE: I admit, I was worried about this one because the older DVD releases were so bad I was sure it was the source material.  I must say I was absolutely happy with this restoration despite minor imperfections.  There is still just a touch of cinematic grain that should absolutely be present (lack of it suggests too much DNR).  Even from a small distance one can see pores on the skin and sweat beads on faces.  There were moments of noticeable softness that I can accept and didn't find that distracting considering all it's strengths.  Some dark scenes are still pretty grainy as one may expect.  However, the stormy blue-grey color pallet is maintained while the brilliant colors of costume leap off the screen and dazzle.  Adjani's pale skin with dark hair, red lips, and blue eyes are haunting.  The glint of her metallic blue and silver dress against the dingy Paris streets was amazing!  Sound also is a substantial improvement. This disc is a MUST upgrade if you love the movie.  The restoration doesn't provide absolute perfection as I don't think perfection is available in this case.  So the key to remember is the amount of improvement.  This should make fans very happy overall.

ACCOLADES: This is one of Isabelle Adjani's most stunning roles for which she won a Csar award for best actress. The movie also won the Jury Prize and 5 Csar awards. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, but some American audiences will find the content graphic with the depiction of the massacre, sexual situations, and overtones of incest.

IMPORTANT NOTES ON RUNTIMES AND OTHER VERSIONS: The original run time as introduced at Cannes 1994 was 161 minutes, a few more than even this 159 minute restored version (***both French and US new release have the same listed run time of 159 min). The official run of the older US release was just 145 minutes. What American audiences may not realize is that the longer 161 min original French version actually DID NOT include the iconic scene of Margot and her lover La Mole wrapped in the red cloak you see on the US cover of the DVD.  The love scene is in both of course, but the following scene outside the stone building was added in the older U.S. version. The U.S. distributor Miramax insisted the scene be included in the original U.S. version to emphasize the relationship more. Though the restored version is closer to the original French and edited by the director, I am happy to report that this scene is included in the new release.  This iconic scene may or may not be important to the story, but it is at once romantic, haunting, poetic and morbid.  It also explains Margot's actions at the end of the movie. I understand there were other odd releases long ago in Australia and elsewhere that ran as long as 171 minutes. The US release, from as recent as 2003, was a huge disappointment because of the poor video and audio quality, as well as the approx. 15 min of missing footage (not due solely to format differences). The current release is the official final cut authorized by the director Patrice Chreau under his supervision.

FRENCH DIGI BOOK vs U.S. COHEN RELEASE: The French Digi-book release is marked for Region A,B,C (1,2,3) so it does work on U.S. players.  However, the special features on the French Digi book release are ALL on an accompanying DVD that is Region 2 ONLY, and also cannot be High Def because of the DVD format.  None of the special features have subtitles either so you better know French for those.  The first extra with historical background and movie production history/interviews was nice, but frankly didn't blow me away.  The extras with storyboard comparisons and the costuming were frankly a disappointment for me because the movie is so amazing in those departments.  I do not recommend the French Digi book release anyway.  The pictures in the book are nice but the discs are hard to remove from the cardboard folders.  The special digi book was not a hit with French market either (the restoration was however) so the chance you would like it over the more sparse Cohen release is slim.  ***The U.S. release on Cohen Media does not bring any of the special features over besides the trailer and voice-over commentary.  There is also a small booklet with notes inside the case that is similar to the digibook photos, but slightly less detailed.  ***Please note that French speakers can turn the English subtitles off on the U.S. release for French only.  However, that has to be done with the ""Subtitles"" button on your remote control.  There is no menu option on-screen to turn them off.  Most Blu Ray players will have the ""subtitles"" button on their remote.

I recommend buying the U.S. Cohen release for all English-only speakers.",1405036800,66,6371,4.822610294117647
6437210,5,B00KOW49OM,"When I first saw this film more than 20 years ago, I remembered it as a romantic, historical love story with gorgeous cinematography and music.  Now that it's been restored to the filmmaker's original vision of blood-soaked human savagery, it feels more contemporary than ever.  What Harvey Weinstein sold us back in 1994 was a two-hour trailer for the real thing.  It's a cinematic masterpiece.",1433635200,,395,5.046153846153846

8660445,5,B00KOW49OM,"I had a few concerns going into this movie, the long run time, the subtitles, and the ridiculous cover that makes this movie look like some sort of lame romance novel.  Not to mention the fact that some of the reviews I'd read said that it was quite confusing with far too many important characters to properly digest.  None of these things were an issue.  The romance aspect of the film is not overbearing in any way.  The run time wasn't a labour and I never lost interest.  And as far as the complicated story, it's actually a fairly basic tale of deceit.  Everyone stabbing everyone else in the back.  The film makers even make it easier to understand for a guy like me who has no knowledge of history by having the prodestants wear all black.  I recommend this movie.  Check it out.",1493769600,,787,4.409722222222222
8660446,5,B00KOW49OM,"This is, by a mile, my favorite costume drama. Director Patrice Chereau creates a sense of place so tangible that you can practically smell the body odor on the clothes and see the manure in the streets. He also gets the best out of a very strong cast, although I would single out Daniel Auteuil's Henri of Navarre for special praise. Oh, and ""Queen Margot"" conveys my favorite movie death scene. I won't spoil it for you. Let me just say you'll never turn the pages of a book quite the same way again.",1491609600,,502,4.351063829787234
