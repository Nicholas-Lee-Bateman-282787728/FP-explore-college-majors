6761788,2,B00OUF232O,"Nicholas Cage plays a former CIA field agent who has been obsessed for 22 years over a terrorist that everyone assumes is dead but that he believes is still alive.  On the same day he finds out that he has an aggressive and incurable disease of the brain a coworker comes to him with proof that his dead nemesis might indeed be alive, although very likely terminally ill himself.  Suffering from the onset of dementia and displaying troubling symptoms that make it clear he won't be functional for much longer, Cage decides to track down and kill his enemy, which he thinks will allow himself to close the book on his life in a satisfying way.

The behind-the-scenes story of Dying of the Light is that producers hired Paul Schrader to write and direct a movie and then decided that they didn't really want a Paul Schrader film after all.  It happened before, most famously with his Exorcist prequel.  Writer/director Paul Schrader, stars Nicolas Cage and Anton Yelchin and original director/associate producer Nicolas Winding Refn have all disowned this version of the movie.  Contractually barred from disparaging the finished product the men let their feelings be known by being photographed wearing t-shirts with the non-disparagement clause printed on the front.

Reportedly the producers re-cut Dying of the Light without Schrader's input but did not do any re-shoots so everything that's in the movie was actually written and directed by Schrader.  The apparent problem is that Schrader was making a thoughtful and melancholy film and the producers re-cut it with the ill-fitting rhythms of a 24 episode.  The editing was meant  to improve pacing but it likely did the opposite--the movie feels choppy rather than fast paced and character driven scenes are cut away from quickly because the producers were impatient to get to the action.  It feels like Dying of the Light might contain one of Nicolas Cage's more accomplished recent performances but it's hard to tell for sure because the movie keeps cutting away from Cage's bigger acting moments in a way that makes it difficult to process or appreciate them.

The confrontation between Nicolas Cage's sick CIA Agent and the terrorist he has been obsessed with killing for over twenty years is about as sad a scene as anything you are ever likely to see in an action thriller of this sort and probably provides the best clue as to the movie Paul Schrader was trying to make.

Of course Paul Schrader has made some lousy movies over his long career and there is no way to really judge whether or not his version is better without actually seeing it--hopefully the home video release will include both versions so people can judge for themselves whether the producers improved the film or not.  My guess is that the director's version will feel moodier and more thoughtful but Dying of the Light can currently only be judged by the version that is available--right now it feels like a failed action thriller with a curiously leashed performance from Nicolas Cage.  Audiences who watch this movie just for the thrills will undoubtedly be disappointed but the producers should have known what they were getting into--even in his version of popcorn mode with genre thrillers like Hardcore, American Gigolo, Cat People and his Exorcist flick Dominion Paul Schrader was never a Tony Scott and his commercial films always felt a little difficult--he was never able to make a slick and easy to digest entertainment, even when he tried.  Dying of the Light only provides more evidence of that.",1417910400,163,3542,4.927731092436975

6761794,5,B00OUF232O,"Yikes...So... clearly Amazon has combined a Nicolas Cage film and a stunning documentary about the dying art of film projection. Hopefully at some point this gets resolved in which case my review er... might seem a bit out of left field. In any case, while this is a hilarious happenstance- at no point, to my knowledge, has Nicolas Cage been a projection booth worker- although based on some of your reviews that might have been a better choice... amirite? Annnnyywayy let's talk about the film at hand! The documentary- ""The Dying of the Light""- is a brilliantly realized piece of cinema that studies the art and history of film projection. It's absolutely fascinating. Moreover it's a beautifully shot film- there isn't a single wasted frame- which for a documentary is no easy feat. It's a film that is easy to fall in love with... it's profound subtlety and reverence for something the filmmaker clearly has a personal passion for. If you truly value the craft, if you are a filmmaker or at all interested in the history of cinema- I cannot recommend the film more highly.  The light might be dying but no need to rage against it... for a slight sliver of it has been preserved here, trapped in time by a true artist.",1496275200,,1222,4.683720930232558

6761825,2,B00OUF232O,"Nicholas Cage has been in so many films that sometimes it's hard to keep track of whether or not he's a ""big star"" or just a really busy working actor.  I like Nicholas Cage, and I think he deserves better material than he is often associated with.  That said, he also continues to turn in uneven performances - some very affecting, some rather stiff, and some that defy description.  The last Nick Cage film  that I watched was ""Joe"" - a gritty drama that Mr, Cage made his own.  A fine performance.  But this film?  I liked the premise, and the production quality was pretty high, but I just couldn't connect Cage on this one, maybe it's because I felt he was having trouble connecting with some of the dialogue, or that his delivery was forced, or that the overall the plot was boring and predictable. I would blame most of this on direction - Cage has a range of things to offer in any scene, and the director should have honed in on the best options. Anton Yelchin (may he rest in peace) delivered a nuanced, low-key performance that provided some sense of grounding . One thing about the film that did strike me was the title.  The phrase ""Dying of the Light"" taken from the Dylan Thomas poem, ""Do not go gentle into that good night"" comes off as rather ironic watching a once-revered actor mired down in a film (or films) like this at this point in his career.  That said, I admire Mr. Cage's work ethic, and his dedication to continue making movies - it isn't easy.  Films like ""Joe"" show that he is still an actor worthy of serious consideration, but overall, this film falls short.",1486252800,3,1591,4.436426116838488

As far as Cage movies go, I give this a 4 out of 5! Forced into retirement and terminally ill, a CIA agent (Nicolas Cage) gets word that his longtime nemesis (Alexander Karim) has resurfaced, so he sets out on a personal mission to kill him. Evan Lake (Nicolas Cage) is a highly-decorated veteran CIA agent and Intelligence Star recipient reduced to a desk job at Langley with his protege and close friend Milton ""Milt"" Schultz (Anton Yelchin). Twenty-two years ago during an op in Africa, Lake was captured by terrorist Muhammad Banir (Alexander Karim) and tortured by having his head repeatedly bashed and having his ear mutilated. During the extraction and ensuing explosion, Banir went missing and was presumed dead, although Lake never bought it and has obsessively tried to find Banir ever since. As a result of the trauma he sustained under torture, Lake is now suffering from early stage frontal temporal dementia, and his boss considers him a liability to the agency.",1482624000,,1146,4.822335025380711

Yeas, true sometimes he doesn't seem to be engaged with his character but most of the time he always delivers the Cage signature performance to greater or lesser degree. This movie might be one of the better ones he has been involved with lately--that is not a criticism of the others or of this one. Regardless, I never miss a Cage movie because he delivers every time in one way or another. Cage in my opinion has been and continues to be one of the eclectic actors in terms of scripts in the business. The man never fears to do something new. Besides I really don't care as Nicolas Cage is always entertaining. Other actors never step outside their comfort zone. Cage's comfort zone is whatever he makes it.",1475539200,,786,4.503496503496503

6762577,3,B00OUF232O,"The premise of this movie is interesting though not totally original. Mr. Cage alters between soft spoken and blustery loud; a condition we are led to understand due to a neurological disease. The acting was not particularly adroit but the outcome was a reason to stay committed to the movie. I watched because I wanted to see Anton Yelchin in some roles not tied to Star Wars. I found myself annoyed because he played it too conservatively and left all the blustering to Cage. The reason he and Cage were such friends never came through. But, it was obvious each needed the other. Directors changed while filming which may account for some of the scrambled scenes. I found that while it was a relatively short work, it seemed longer because the pacing was so slow. . And the reason his first encounter with his nemesis didn't end the way he wanted was to me, a wtf moment. The ending was kind of a cliffhanger too...Did he or didn't he ....no spoilers here. You could do better in watching this but also, you could do worse. It's serviceable.",1469318400,,1043,4.5828877005347595

6763174,3,B00OUF232O,"Seems to be a fairly accurate portrayal of their agency as far as interpersonal interaction go. I'm not an agency insider but I've done a bit of research because I'm interested in how the cult group known as the Central Intelligence Agency operates. They recruit new members based on lies (like they are defending their country) but fail to mention that they must become human parasites. I call a person who commits immoral and perfidious actions against their fellow man and collects a paycheck for it a parasite.

But this is mostly a pro CIA movie so why even three stars? Because the dialog was intelligent and nuanced and because of a couple of lines in the movie that rang true.

[""effed"" is in place of... well you know what it's in place of]
CIA Director: ""There is a concern that you could become a liability to the agency.""
Agent Lake (Cage): ""I'm a liability? You've effed this up just like you effed-up everything else. You effed-up Iran/Contra, effed-up (Aldrich) Ames, effed-up 9/11, effed-up WMD, effed-up Afghanistan, Iraq, Benghazi... not you, yourself, of course. No, you're just the latest in a long line of eff-ups who've turned this agency into a cesspool of politics and special interests on behalf of the weapons makers and the surveillance industry who get richer while we get weaker.""

Hey, not bad. That's a lot of ops they ""effed-up"" but and missing a few ops but who's counting? I lost count. No mention of the how's or why's they effed and definitely pushing the official false, effed-up 9/11 scenario. Let's just say that if the CIA has a hand in it, innocent people die needlessly to benefit the filthy rich and powerful.

Muhamid Banir: ""The truly dangerous people are the ones who follow orders.""

Oh hell yes. This was said in a most slurred fashion so it might go unnoticed but it was said nevertheless. The mindless order-followers of the police, military, and secretive agencies are seriously wrong and it is THEY who will bear the weight of their actions in time; not their masters who give the orders.",1462147200,,2040,4.751412429378531

I'm not usually critical of movies but 20 minutes into this and I could tell it was going downhill. I persevered until the end but was totally let down.

The acting is okay. There really isn't need for special effects in this because there's nothing special to be effected. The plot is just awful!

After watching this expect to be let down and feeling as if you'll never be able to get that time back. Time that would be better spent watching a tree grow.",1456790400,,608,4.232758620689655

He has been in too many movies to escape his personal identity. I just see a blur of all his roles. He also doesn't possess the skills for this role. Instead of nuances you get either semi-conscious or raging. That's it. I am still not sure what is happening when he drives. There are many scenes of him driving, but all we see is him looking confused. Then someone honks at him or pulls him over. Why? The never show what he is doing that is wrong. I almost wonder if he did some of the eye-rolling narrative in the car that the director just cut out because it was too way over the top.

In Dying of the Light, he plays a man, Evan Lake, considerably older than he really is, but does so with subtlety. For this part, he must balance the confusion and frustration of a man whose deteriorating mind is betraying him with his sharper, experienced self. The story builds to the ultimate encounter between Lake and his nemesis, only to surprise us with the kind of reversal one sees in The Railway Man. There is some satisfaction in Lake's character, but complete betrayal calls for swift and unambiguous response. Cage is play the Evan Lake role with an air of manly determination in the face of inevitable impotence -- a bittersweet and brilliant performance.

Cage jumps up on the stage, and flails around like a boy scout working on a marching merit badge, and it is just horrible. He looks and sounds like anything but the former Marine, he is supposed to be. And it goes down hill from there.

Viewers who trash this movie because it is not a pyromaniac, adrenaline-gushing, special-effects ride, or those who overdraw the writer-director firecracker PR may be missing its point.

Dying Of The Light reminds us that we are all rapidly-aging mammals. And it is a story centered on an unreliable point-of-view, making us question every part of the story. The CIA Officer played by Nicolas Cage is diagnosed with a terminal brain injury. He is subject to time-loss, lapse of memory, irrational outbursts, palsy, and hallucinations. Nothing can be taken for granted, and that makes for great suspense. A Beautiful Mind without the sudden surprise?

Facing rapid decline, Cage's CIA Officer gets a bead on ""the one who got away,"" a murderous terrorist scumbag hiding for twenty years. The terrorist is also very ill and headed for the grave. But is he harmless? Should the dying spy expedite the terrorist's dirt nap? What would be accomplished? What is justice in this case? Decide for yourself.

The movie is more than good. It does not bash you with a political agenda about CIA. No silly hatchet job aimed at the super-smart people who risk their lives, on a chump change salary, to protect us from our perpetual national adversaries. Nor does it make Field Officers look like anything but mortal and fallible.

The movie title is obviously a nod to Dylan Thomas's villanelle, ""Do not go gentle into that good night."" Here's a stanza:

  ""Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
  Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.""",1451260800,17,1640,4.945255474452555

The film is also very rare in even mentioning Sayyid Qutb, the architect of the current global Jihad! But even before his visit to America, Qutb both condemned the decadence of its Liberal culture that had even spread to Egypt and called for Jihad (as reflected in a 1938 poem, On the Palestinian Arabs during the Palestine Arab Revolt). It was this cultural corruption (not American foreign policy) that first inspired Qutb and his vision as intellectual godfather of the Muslim Brotherhood (founded 1928, so popular in this Administration), progenitor of all modern Jihadism. I wish the film had also mentioned Qutbs strategy to conquer America by using our history of slavery to incite blacks to revolt.

Yet the film did also very perceptively mention the joining together of Islam and Marxism to destroy western civilization abusing the concept of Social Justice! Few, if any, other films have revealed that stratagem even though we see it now occurring in the Marxist-Islamist Administration and their fomenting of Black racist violence against whites.

So, next time a Liberal /Progressive wants to simplistically blame Israel or U.S. policy in the Middle-East for Jihadism, inform them that this current third historic wave of global Islamic Jihad was birthed as a pious Islamic reaction against Liberal decadence before WW II and the following even happened. It is Progresso-Lib spewing of decadence throughout the world, their promotion of Sodomism, destruction of marriage, etc., that are the greatest recruiting tools for swelling Jihadist ranks.

Johnny To is staggering on every level, works with the same group of Hong Kong/Macao actors and had the brains to cast Johnny Hallyday, who is an amazing magnetic force on film but has never been cast in Hollywood, as he never mastered English (even though he spends a lot of time here in L.A.) and has had some health problems.

6764492,4,B00OUF232O,"Dying of the Light  Grindstone Entertainment  2014  Rated R  Blu-Ray edition

Key point: this is a Nicholas Cage film.  Cage has a long history of making grade B or lower movies.  He stamped himself on filmgoers consciousness with City of Angels, and then gave us films like Con Air, Ghost Rider and Ghost Rider II [hangs headYES I actually watched the sequel BUT.ok.actually I don't really have a good defense].

Second key point: In this film Cage fully embraces middle-age-dom, if I can nounify an adjective.  [Possibly my worst sentence EVER].  And I think this is a good career move.  His pot belly is visible.  His hair is grey.  He actually gives a good performance as a CIA operative well past his prime.
Story concept: decades ago he was one of the CIAs best field operatives.  In one mission he was kidnapped, tortured and almost killed by a radical Islamist.
Flash forward 2 decades.  Hes been stuck as a desk jockey ever since.  Hes never forgotten about that terrorist who almost killed him, and that although the CIA seems convinced the man is dead, Cage suspects hes still alive.

Cage is given a diagnosis of fronto-temporal dementia, which is an uncommon dementia that tends to progress more rapidly than Alzheimers.  And a bad blow to the head he received at the hands of this terrorist just might have, decades later, contributed to the development of his terminal illness.
A younger colleague-friend discovers credible evidence the terrorist is in fact alive.  The terrorist too suffers from a slowly progressive and fatal illness: thallasemia.  Cage's buddy (played by Anton Yelchin) has found shipments of drugs used to treat thallasemia going from Europe to Kenya, where this terrorist went underground.  A simple plan: find the doctor writing the prescriptions and work back from there to the recipient.

The CIA is aware of Evan Lakes dementia diagnosis [thats Cages character] and won't approve this mission.  Of course, he goes anyhow, younger sidekick in tow and with good reason, concerned about his safety in the field with a diagnosis of early dementia and two decades of desk work.
Several themes are at play in the film.  Theres the usual paranoia about big-government bureaucracy.  Is the CIA simply dense, or are they actually protecting this terrorist for unclear reasons?  Then we have to throw in an old love-interest for Cage.  Theres also the constant concern about radical Islam, since 2001.  Theres the tension between Cages early dementia and his desire for one last field mission to get the guy who killed dozens of innocent civilians and may have caused Cages own terminal condition.  Cage does what I felt was a very credible job of portraying the waxing and waning symptoms of mild dementia, including sundowning.  The film builds to a peak at the very end, when Cage and the ageing terrorist finally confront each other.  The result is more subtle, more nuanced than an action film like Expendables would ever consider playing it out.  Although I didn't feel the acting beyond Cages was exceptional, Alexander Karim as the terrorist Banir probably has the second-strongest performance in this film.  I almost feel this film should pass as PG-13, because compared to games teens play and other movies they do watch, I don't think this is more violent, and it certainly is no more sexual.  Undoubtedly the opening of the movie is the most disturbing: the scene in which Cage is being tortured.  Simply because this is a lot better than the average Cage movie, I cant help but give this a B+.",1445644800,4,3537,4.887394957983194

6764494,4,B00OUF232O,"Nicholas Cage plays the role of a former and once elite CIA field agent (Evan Lake) who was captured and brutally tortured some 22 years before by a major terrorist leader and was (rather miraculously) saved by an extremely timely raid by US Special Forces. He is now behind a desk, totally unfit for field operations, and reduced to delivering once a year the odd stirring speech to young CIA trainees. HE discovers, on the same day, that he has an incurable brain disease  a form of dementia  and that the terrorist who tortured him and that everyone except himself believes to be dead is in fact alive.

The rest of the story is terribly predictable. Against all caution, and although (or because?) he is terminally ill, he wants to settle accounts. So he of course decides to track down and eliminate his former torturer almost single handed, with the help of Milton, a young agent who admires the has-been and everything he stands for. They will, of course, find their target and there will, of course, be a reckoning between the two men, both of which have incurable diseases. The end is also quite predictable, although I will let you guess it for yourself.

Despite all this, I enjoyed the film and found it had a number of qualities, even if the scenario is not exactly original. I would also agree that Cages acting is perhaps not among his best, but it nevertheless good enough for him to deliver a rather convincing and somewhat frightening performance of the rather horrid symptoms that go with his disease. Added to this, the tracking down of the terrorist chief and the action surrounding it is rather interesting and exciting even if some bits may be somewhat hard to believe.

However, the main quality that this film has in my view is its atmosphere, and in particular the spleen and pervasive sadness that is contained in a number of scenes. It is rather clear from the beginning that the heros last self-imposed quest will not have a happy ending. Another reviewer already mentioned the sadness of the scene where the two aged and ill adversaries come face to face. In a similar vein, there are also a couple more features, with the hero bidding goodbye to the only person he truly loved and could have lived a different life with  his main source and contact in Europe  and with his final demise.

Contrary to other reviewers, I do not know what the film was supposed to look like according to its original Director and whether it would have been better or not had this Directors version been released instead of this one. What I do know, however, is that this film, however imperfect and despite a number of clichs, has something going for it and was entertaining.

he suspected otherwise his tormentor 'Mohammed Bahir'(Alexander Karim) was killed during the raid.
These days, 'Evan' sits behind a desk at the C.I.A Offices in 'Langley' but craves to get back out there doing what he does best,
however a medical examination confronts him with a devastating truth he has an advanced form of dementia.
The result of the examination will force his retirement with immediate effect, meanwhile he is told by a 'sidelined' agent, 'Milton' (Anton
Yelchin) that 'Bahir' is believed to be alive, wherabouts unknown.
'Evan' though at his own expense and authority has a score to settle, 'Milton' who has always admired the decorated agents deeds of
yesteryear wants to help 'Evan' in his search, though not wanting to admit it, he'll need all the help he can get.
His condition is progressive, he will experience forgetfulness and behaviour changes which could hamper him in completing his objective.
After some research by 'Milton' their search commences in 'Bucharest' where an old associate 'Michelle' (Irene Jacob) is more than willing
to help..........
Sadly 'Nicolas Cage' who has starred in many a blockbuster down the years seems to be accepting roles that doesn't stretch his undoubted
talent, though playing an ailing Agent is okay, he does give a convincing performance of many of the related symptoms.
The films '18' certificate is somewhat misleading in truth, though there are violent sequences i don't feel they are extreme enough to warrant
the rating, given what can be seen in many of today's 12 and 12-A's.

6764533,2,B00OUF232O,"Parent with Alzheimer's? Maybe this is your movie...if you're a guy who digs a serving of action film with a super-sized portrayal of neural deterioration. I actually liked some of the effects used to signal the brain decay. But this is not a good film.

Millions of us Gen X tribals grew up with Cage. We admired Cage as our generation's risk-taking genius actor, an anti-Hollywood actor in something of the early to mid-career Jack Nicholson way. As American cinema royalty --Francis Ford Coppola's nephew-- maybe we were all surprised and delighted that Cage had not only the pedigree, but plenty of marvelous, original brilliant talent and never stopped exploring. The insider who's really an outsider. You might be standing in a bar in LA or San Francisco, and maybe Cage would walk up and buy you a drink c. late 80s - early 90s. Unlike many stars, Cage had no Hollywood pretense whatsoever. He was just a funny, super bright guy who was also an actor bringing the finest acting talent, and mostly making superior choices about the roles he'd take on.

If you're not in that generation, say over 45, don't be mislead by this or many of Cage's films over the last decade.

Instead, know there really are some great, even a couple of extraordinary Nicholas Cage films that have remained ageless, inspiring...movies that are still inspiring actors, writers, and directors. THE WORTHY ONES: if you've never seen Cage's contribution to great art as Sailor in David Lynch's other landmark of High Art/High Strangeness, I'm talking about WILD AT HEART, rent it, buy it, borrow it,  just watch it now to enjoy Cage and Willem DaFoe do some surreal smackdown Lynchian movie magic. And there's hilarious classic, kidnappy roadtrip movie that changed American comedy films forever, RAISING ARIZONA. See that again or for the first time.  Many of everybody's favorite *dark* comedy films of the last 20 years owe nearly everything to RAISING ARIZONA. Yeah, great writers and directors made those vehicles for Cage. But this is a Cage film review.

Another of my favorite films ever made --even apart from Cage-- is post-modern western noir, John Dahl's extraordinary RED ROCK WEST, showcasing Cage and Twin Peak's Lara Flynn Boyle,  Dennis Hopper playing a superb twist on his usual type, and legendary character actor ""Lucky"" J.T.Walsh,  leaving no plot twist unturned...or predictable. Cage carried the strange little thriller with acting so natural --somehow managing believably bitter yet unassuming,  lovestruck and murderous all at once,  that I'd say he actually surpassed Bogart's noir tour de force, THE BIG SLEEP.

Over the last decade plus, many Cage pics have crashed and burned in an overwhelm o' badness. DYING OF THE LIGHT seems to me to be somewhere between the worst and the kind of formula industry standard action films of 15 years ago.

But because of WILD AT HEART and the Coen Brothers' RAISING ARIZONA, and especially, RED ROCK WEST, I give most of them a try. The strangely compelling sequel BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL NEW ORLEANS directed by Werner Herzog, is a more recent and weirdly intriguing Cage delight.

I'm just another believer waiting for more great film roles by Gen X legend, Nicholas Cage.",1421971200,13,3224,4.970260223048327

6764540,3,B00OUF232O,"The big story associated with this film is that its director, Paul Schrader, was locked out of the editing room and denied final cut. Subsequently, Schrader and the stars have disowned this version. However, despite their reaction out of principle, DYING OF THE LIGHT isn't that terrible. It's merely underwhelming. Nicolas Cage gives a decent performance as Evan Lake, a veteran CIA agent with recently diagnosed dementia. Upon receiving some intelligence which indicates that a former target may still be alive, he decides to go after them before his disease puts him out of commission permanently. At its core, this film has an interesting concept that is never fully realized to its full thematic potential: two nemeses have one final reckoning while each are battling a debilitating disease. From what I saw, Nicolas Cage put in some good character work, and even gets to ""rage"" a little bit, but he was still hampered by an editing job that seemed to be going for a more streamlined thriller. Due to this, it felt like there was a fair amount of character development missing, mostly from supporting players but also from Cage himself. His disease doesn't take as big of a role as you might think, given its severity. As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, everyone did a good job but they really weren't given a whole lot to work with. Anton Yelchin was the only other name actor I recognized, and his presence seemed rather perfunctory. Perhaps he would have had a larger role in Paul Schrader's cut, but we'll probably never know unless it gets released on Blu-ray/DVD. All of the technical aspects of the film were good, although it did have the rather depressing color palette associated with low-budget Eastern European thrillers. The editing in the fight scenes was a bit choppy, but the camerawork was ok for the most part otherwise. The score also wasn't too memorable, but it still fit the material to a degree. The only part of it I genuinely liked was the track that played over the closing credits. Overall, I wasn't expecting a masterpiece and of course I didn't get one. However, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be either, somewhat to its detriment. Scenes began and then ended without much incident and didn't contribute much to the overall story. A part of me wished that it was worse because at least then it would be memorable. What I got was purely middle-of-the-road and, dare I say it, a little dull. Those looking for a fired-up Nicolas Cage performance should look elsewhere. You'd be perfectly justified in skipping this. (2.5/5)",1419811200,38,2573,4.797297297297297

6764542,3,B00OUF232O,"This espionage film comes out under a significant and foreboding cloud.  Removed from highly regarded director Paul Schrader's control by the financiers during post-production, it is a film disowned by its creators.  Schrader, leading man Nicolas Cage, co-star Anton Yelchin, and executive producer Nicolas Winding Refn posted pictures of themselves online wearing t-shirts emblazoned with their contracts' non-disparagement clauses.  An interesting form of social-media protest:  turning a contractual obligation not to criticize a film into a vehicle of criticism.

As for the finished film (product?) regarded apart from the context of its production as much as one can, it is captivating, yet uneven.  For every two virtues, there is a blemish, and it is frustrating.  Cage, exuding exhaustion and his hair greyed, delivers one of his finest performances of recent years as a CIA veteran diagnosed with degenerative frontotemporal dementia.  As his mind and body begin to betray him, he races to tie the most haunting loose end of his career:  finding and punishing an elusive radical who nearly tortured him to death two decades ago.  Suspense films of this nature often find their protagonists racing against time in one way or another (defuse a bomb, save an abducted child).  Here, he is racing against mortality, and it is a poignant twist.  There is a fantastic scene early on in which he delivers a speech to the agency's new recruits, at first chastising them for embracing an ugly beast such as the CIA, with its in-house political gamesmanship and questionable post-9/11 record, but then praising them for heeding the call of public service despite any cynical misgivings.  As performed by Cage, the speech seems two-thirds sentimental bull, one-third deeply felt and pleading.

Though the actor is always charismatic, the Anton Yelchin character is a bit inexplicable.  I never entirely believed this fresh-faced agent would sacrifice his career and maybe even his life to help his mentor with an extrajudicial manhunt.  He seems a contrived inclusion to give the often despondent and unstable antihero a vigorous, youthful, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit-esque counterpart.  And the film simply falls apart in its final 20 minutes, an unsatisfying and rushed blur of gunfire, gory vengeance, and inadequate lunges toward catharsis.",1419552000,3,2342,5.355191256830601

Lake has an obsession for finding Banir, which his agency believes is dead. Unfortunately Lake has Frontotemporal Dementia and goes through all kind of mood swings and mental fits.

Cage has two major speeches in this film. One he gives to new recruits and another is a tirade against the CIA and US government in general. I cringed during both speeches.

Not the best Cage film or revenge film or spy film out there. Might be okay as a cheap rental.

Nicolas Cage starts off yelling at some kids on a school excursion to a CIA talk at a careers festival or something, where he relives his time tied to a chair being yelled at by some guy who cuts his ear before his rescuers turn up seconds too late. Instead of giving their agent the accolades and respect he deserved, for the past twenty years Cage has been benched to a desk.  He's understandably not happy, or is he, his doctor has told him he has a worse than Alzheimers brain deterioration disease and he's got two years at best before the man he was is completely gone.  His diseases also makes him have verbal agressive outbursts ,paranoia and other seen by those around him as negative social interaction behaviour.  So things aren't going well for him in his CIA office based workplace.  But an underling has found some information on his arch nemesis who cut his ear long ago who the CIA think has been dead for 22 years.  Apparently he's not and like Cage has a crippling rare only a couple of people in the world suffer from it condition killing him.  There's been some unusual activity with a doctor subscribing and shipping it to Africa something that is only used in a select few research facilities.  Cage wants to be sent to investigate, but the CIA is having none of that.  In fact they're telling him, he's fired.",1528761600,,1448,4.413533834586466

Lake is moving on with his life when new information comes to light, that his old nemesis, a terrorist leader long believed dead, is back. Knowing their best chance to catch him is Lake, they turn to him for help, but can he keep it together long enough to complete his mission? This unbelievably was a b-movie, yet a remarkably strong performance for Nicholas Cage, who randomly had to go between C.I.A. legend and confused old man. His performance is aided by the late Anton Yelchin, playing an analyst who admires Lake so much, that he goes against orders to help him with his mission. The whole dynamic between the man at the end of his career on his last mission, and the boy at the start of his career on his first mission, really added something different, that you don't typically see in espionage films. Dying of The Light really does have a lot to like about it, but one must remember, it is an espionage film and a direct-to-video one at that. The writing isn't spectacular and parts of it are more than somewhat confusing. They also throw in a lot of Evan's flashbacks and delusions at the completely wrong times, which really did start to bother me as the film got more intense. Overall, I did enjoy this film, I thought the acting was terrific, and I loved the dynamic and chemistry between the two leading men, despite the obvious age difference. Dying of The Light certainly isn't a perfect movie, but it's still an entertaining one.",1499817600,,1660,4.611486486486487
