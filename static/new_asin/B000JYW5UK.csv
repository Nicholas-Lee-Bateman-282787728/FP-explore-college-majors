2680613,4,B000JYW5UK,"Incredibly well done for such a pitiful budget. Both the cinematography and script are shaky sometimes but there's an underlying story there that makes the whole thing work. I love the beginning and Lance is such a strong actor that I fall right into the story. But then the second act starts and I can only guess this was done by a second unit because there's a terrible ""blue"" hue to the whole picture and looks to be over-exposed. There's also a delay between the audio and video where the audio run slightly ahead of the video. Kinda like watching a dubbed foreign movie, very distracting! This movie also suffers from uneven acting. Some of the actor are a little weak and unconvincing, it's unfortunate. It gets better once they're in the woods and the sun finally goes down. The horrible blue hue goes away. Now all the actors are finally in one spot playing off each other and it works. One thing this film really has going for it is the man in the Squatch suit. A real person interacting with the other actors is almost always better than low budget CGI monster peril! The ending was a bit of a downer though. What I really enjoyed were the little details like Lance sitting on his porch reading the book: Bigfoot; The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality available here on Amazon.

2680616,4,B000JYW5UK,"Lance Henriksen is a favorite actor of mine. He brings a certain laid back nonchalence to his roles and this one's no different. He and a couple of old (emphasis on old) friends track bank robbers into the woods on the mountain with the idea to apprehend them and bring them back to face trial. The sasquatch deals his own justice after the fleeing robbers kill his wife(?).
We have a blend of criminals on the run and the revenge of the death of a loved one. The sasquatch is really the star of the movie, and his motives are clear and concise.",1364860800,,545,4.300970873786408

2680619,5,B000JYW5UK,Another one of those movies that are just enjoyable to watch and sit back to relax with a cup of tea.  It does have a plot and I enjoy Lance Henriksen very much.  Movie consists of bank robbers who get away from the police and escape into the woods.  Unfortunately they run into some very bad Sasquatches and slowly get killed while police are tracking them down. Some blood and gore but not a lot.,1356825600,,398,4.28
2680620,4,B000JYW5UK,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie.  Any movie that has the name of the monster (Sasquatch) and location (Mountain) in the title usually conveys all you need to know about the film.  But Sasquatch Mountain defies the usual genre conventions by having little to do with Sasquatch.

What Sasquatch Mountain is really about is fatherhood. It begins with home video-style footage of Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) arriving on a deserted highway to fix his stranded wife's car. She captures a Sasquatch on tape, only to be subsequently killed in a car accident. Flash forward decades later to a bank robbery.

What?  A bank robbery? What are bank robbers doing in a Sasquatch film?

Director Steven R. Monroe tweaks our expectations by having the robbers wear gorilla masks. Each of these robbers hides a secret: ring leader Travis Cralle (Craig Wasson) is a wannabe day trader who uses military lingo to make up for the fact that he never measured up in his father's eyes; Kayla Keller (Karem Kim) is a bitter drifter who still bears the scars of her abusive boyfriend; and Vin Stewart (Michael Worth, who also wrote the screenplay) is the devil-may-care wheelman who uses and abuses women.

Chasing this colorful cast of crooks is Sheriff Harris Zeff (Rance Howard, father of Ron Howard) who should have retired long ago but refuses to stop working; Eil Van Cleef (Tim Thomerson) a hunter brought in to track the robbers; and a bumbling assortment of inexperienced deputies.

Caught in the middle is the beautiful if vapid Erin Price (Cerina Vincent), who trips up the bank robbers in an unfortunate car accident and becomes their hostage. Like the other characters, Price has a past - she was moving across country to leave behind her abusive fianc&eacute;.

Each violent conflict between the robbers and lawmen attracts the attention of ""Big Woolly,"" Knowles' name for the Sasquatch. The survivors hole up in a cabin that just happens to be the home of a long-dead loner who was feeding the Sasquatches.

In between the gun battles and fisticuffs, Big Woolly decimates the survivors one-by-one. But, as we discover by the end of the movie, he's just defending his family...

...and Cralle just wanted to make his father proud.

...and Knowles wife's death is vindicated.

...and Stewart learns that maybe it's time to stop abusing women.

...and Zeff realizes maybe he can teach Stewart a thing or two.

...and Price finally lets go of the abusive past she left behind.

The movie's occasionally forced dialogue is punctuated by emotional moments.  Henriksen has one of his most riveting scenes on film when, after retelling the tale of his wife's death, Price plays the last video she recorded and we see Knowles retreat, wounded and horrified as the memory rushes back, into the darkness.

With its lack of gore, low-FX Sasquatch, and fast-cut transitions, Sasquatch Mountain will disappoint monster movie fans.  But as a parable about men, women, and children it's quite moving. The finale is particularly sad as the Sasquatch's death rattle is answered by the cry of a child. If Sasquatch Mountain has a message, it's this: the sins of the father are visited on their children.",1286582400,,3187,4.9344569288389515
2680621,4,B000JYW5UK,I saw this movie for the first time a few years ago on the sci-fi channel and i liked it. i tend to enjoy the sci-fi channel movies and this has been one of my favs. If you are into the big foot movies and the movie that air on sci-fi channel then this is a good movie for you.,1281916800,,277,3.6333333333333333

2680643,3,B000JYW5UK,"This movie had a few things going for it that raised it up from the usual low budget monster movie.

1. Lance Henrickson. I have yet to see him give a bad performance, even in some of the crappiest movies, and this one wasn't crappy.

2. Decent plot. No massive plot holes.

3. Acting from the rest of the cast was OK. Nothing stellar, but far from painful.

The biggest problem I had with the movie was the location. The forest looked no more dense or threatening than the woods in my back yard. Had the lighting been darker and more moody, and the woods more remote feeling, I'd have given this a fourth star (4 stars for a low budget monster movie).",1276214400,,652,4.276422764227642
2680644,2,B000JYW5UK,"First off, this is that Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrickson, oh wait, there's THREE Sasquatch movies with Lance Henrickson. What is up with that? They're not even sequels (I think). Mr. Henrikson has certainly cornered the market, carved his niche, made his mark, etc. in this genre. When it comes to Sasquatch, he is the Man.

Besides Sasquatch, one of the mysteries of Sasquatch Mountain is, ""why does it have a Sasquatch?"" The plot of the movie is about stolen money, kidnapping, and assorted angst. The characters, be they robbers, lawmen, kidnappers, or kidnappees freely unload their emotional catharsis on one another in between trying to shoot each other. All of them are tormented by something in their past and then a Sasquatch is thrown in to torment their present. The biggest emotional baggage is carried by Henrikson, whose wife is apparently run over by a Sasquatch in a pick-up in the first scene (watch his video closely).

One of my favorite 80's actors, Tim Thomerson, plays a real salty dog, who is later matched in salty dogness by Henrikson, when they team up briefly. Now here would have been a great Sasquatch movie. Too bad these old pros share so little screen time together.

The best part of Sasquatch Mountain is the Sasquatch scenes. They are pretty creepy and violent. For would-be Sasquatch sighters, they are pleasantly satisfying in their brief blurred imagery. Except for that final Sasquatch death scene, where I could swear I heard Dylan's ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" in the background. Really?
I mean Sasquatches go to Heaven?",1273449600,,1566,4.969465648854962
2680645,4,B000JYW5UK,"As a hardcore Bigfoot enthusiast (though not a believer) and a HUGE fan of monster movies for the past 30 something years, I've seen most of the Bigfoot films out there.  Some, like ""The Curse of Bigfoot"" used to be shown on creature features in the '70s and I ate them up as a kiddo.  Ditto ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" and ""Snowbeast.""  The monsters were blood-thirsty, the actors were fairly amateur at best, and the action was just enough to keep the flick from gettin gboring.

The latest crop of Bigfoot films have been a fairly mixed bag.  Some (like ""Sasuqtch"" and ""Yeti"") are so bad, that even as a deyed in the wool B-movie afficianado, I simply can't sit through them without a half gallon of cheap whiskey. And even then, I'd rather go put my head in a bread mixer for 90 minutes. Others like ""Abominable,"" ""Sasquatch Hunters,"" and this movie, are damned entertaining in that '70's and '80's bad movie way.  Plenty of action, hardcore monsters, and no shortage of blood and guts.  ""Sasquatch Mountain"" starts as a bank heist movie.  There's cops, robbers, shooting, and a porn star-looking hostage to boot.  From there, it goes on to resemble (to me at least) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Firday the 13th movies.  Namely, a group of people is caught in unfamiliar territory, being pursued by a huge, scary, angry, and homicidal monster that simlpy wants them dead.  They run, it follows.  They hole up in a cabin, it follows.  Turns out the guy who owns the cabin is dead on the can ""like Elvis"" as one of the characters points out. Also just so happens the dead guy has been feeding the monster with horse grain, and the monster's a mom to boot.  Seems momma monster's simply been protecting her territory from the intruders.  The kills are pretty good (not great) and the characters are prone to incredibly akward and stilted expository dialogue, the likes of which you only ever see in bad WB teeny bopper shows (at least from what I can tell by seeing the previews of them in commercials).  BUT, there's action, Lance Henriksen doing his thing as only he can, a leading lady with huge, bouncy silicone boobs, and best of all, at the end of the movie, they play an actual 911 recording of a guy calling to report a ""real"" Bigfoot encounter.  The geek in me jumped for joy and nearly dropped his inhaler.

The ""making of"" featurette is pretty good as well. I wasn't expecting something like this on a straight to DVD flick, but there's a brief, though informative bit on the makeup fx design of the creature, interviews with the actors, and a set visit.  An excellent surprise, and endeared the film even more to me.

All in all, well worth the $2.50 I paid for it. Heck, I'd have paid $10.00 for it since I'll be watching it again for sure. If you're a fan of Bigfoot horror movies and are on the fence about this one, just go ahead and buy it.  You'll be really glad you did.",1243900800,,2892,4.491395793499044

Closing time at the bars, Mack and his bros are liquored up and have been rejected by the hotties on the dance floor.  Time to lower the standards.

ROOAARRAAHHAWL!!!
translation:""yes I'll come home with you little man""

Morning comes, Mack is scrambling for some aspirin, excuses, and some raw meat--Sasquatch is looking hungry!  Aw geez....

This movie won't give you nightmares or a lifelong itch.  It's actually better than expected.

Some bank robbers flee into the forest with a hostage and some bumbling cops on their tail.  And you guessed it, in them there woods there's also afugly hairy chick Mack dropped off after a one-nighter.

I know, I'm bad.  This flick isn't though.  I was expecting a cheesy, over-the-top gorefest with bad acting, dialogue, and special effects.  Not the case.  This is more of a moderately-paced character study film.  A cross between First Blood, Blair Witch, and my hairy butt.  J/K, this is not like Blair Witch.
It has a hot chick (no nudity) and a bit of a King Kong-Beauty and the Beast vibe developing at the end.  The creature is usually shown in glimpses throughout the movie, but not because the costume was bad.  The acting & script are both decent too.  Not bad...",1241913600,,1228,4.822115384615385
2680647,5,B000JYW5UK,"Director: Steven Monroe
Writer: Michael Worth
Runtime: 90 minutes
Locations: Williams, Flagstaff and Coconino Nat. Forest, Arizona
Year of TV Release: 2006

THE PLOT: After an unfortunate auto accident, Cerina Vincent is taken captive by a gang of bank robbers who are forced to flee into the Arizona timber by foot. They are followed closely by a posse made up of policemen and old Vietnam vets. The two groups ultimately team-up (sort of) when they encounter a Bigfoot creature who is picking 'em off one by one.

Although I highly doubt the creature exists, I'm fascinated by the Bigfoot legend and enjoy films on the subject. ""Sasquatch Mountain"" is one of the best, if not the best. It was originally titled ""Devil on the Mountain"" and, in fact, that's the title that appears on the dvd.

To be expected, some people smugly laugh at the picture, calling it unintentionally funny and cheesy, but nothing could be further from the truth. This is actually a character study using the Bigfoot legend as a stage. The story and characters are taken seriously and there's no goofiness to be found. The reason some automatically laugh at it is because the idea of Sasquatch has become a big joke, which is understandable.

I should point out that if you're expecting a mindless slasher flick with Bigfoot in the evil Jason role you'll be disappointed. The film ""Abominable"" (2006) is a film along these lines. It's a good film for what it is and there's nothing wrong with this approach, it's just that ""Sasquatch Mountain"" shoots for something deeper.

The screenplay was written, believe it or not, by Michael Worth who stars in the picture as one of the bank robbers, Vin. The guy comes off as a 35-year-old adolescent who is more likable than scary, even though he has a slight dangerous edge.

NOTEWORTHY ITEMS:

- Although the film is a low-budget straight-to-video flick it's a very well-made film, unlike ""Sasquatch Hunters"" (2005) and ""Sasquatch"" (2002), which both had some amateurish qualities.
- The score is great, sometimes even moving, giving the film a palpable reverent quality.
- Although the set-up is a bit contrived (the way the bank robbers get a hostage and flee on foot), the story starts to pull you in at the half-hour mark when the posse pursues the gang in the woods. There are numerous well-written character-defining episodes that successfully capture the viewer's attention.
- For instance, the lead bank robber, played by Craig Wasson, laments how his father never paid him any attention growing up. I know what you're thinking -- aw, poor baby -- but the film successfully shows the correlation between adult wellness and healthy parental relationships, in particularly with the father-figure. Often children from dysfunctional families spend their entire lives trying to make up for the damage done by clueless parents.
- I also like the way Wasson and others are shown  not totally poisoned by evil, despite being bank robbers, e.g. Wasson does a really selfless deed without hesitation later in the film. It's a good scene. Not to mention (as already noted) Michael Worth comes off as more misguided than malevolent; though Lance Henriksen doesn't give in to his charm one bit.
- To be expected in a character study, the screenplay has some great dialogue and lines. For instance, Wasson states: ""No matter how hard you try or how high you get there's always some devil on the mountain waiting to knock you back down"" or the Asian girl to Cerina: ""Everyone has scars, but not everyone has the option of hiding behind a pretty smile.""
- The film features no less than three beautiful women -- a Brunette (Cerina Vincent), a redhead (Lance's daughter in the story, played by Melanie Monroe) and the Asian bank Robber (Karen Kim) who comes off unattractive only because she's so bitter. Both Cerina and Melanie are magnificent. Melanie is the definition of spirituality.
- There's a good subplot about Lance Henriksen being a laughingstock for the past 15 years or so. His wife had recorded a vague video of the creature on the day she was killed by a hit-and-run. The video put the town on the map as a tourist attraction but made him an object of ridicule. Will he ever be redeemed?
- Although the Sasquatch kills in the story, he is shown in a sympathetic light (unlike ""Abominable"" and ""Sasquatch Hunters"").
- The dvd features a worthwhile 20-minute ""Making Of"" Documentary.

FINAL ANALYSIS: I love ""Sasquatch Mountain"" and give it a weak 5/5 Stars or A-. It may not be ""Apocalypse Now"" but for a straight-to-video Bigfoot film it's quite good for all the above reasons. It should be given credit for not being another mindless monster flick; the Bigfoot legend is simply a frame for something deeper. Not everyone can look beyond the Sasquatch trappings; I understand this. I could and found it quite entertaining and even moving.",1228521600,,4865,4.873035066505441
2680648,3,B000JYW5UK,"Though this movie is actually at least one step above the normal made-for-SciFi movie, this review is actually concerned only with the two things that made this movie really enjoyable: Rance Howard and Lance Henriksen.  If either of these two men has ever ""phoned in"" a performance, no matter how lame the script or low the budget, I've never seen it.  In this movie Rance plays the old sheriff to a tee, and Lance is ten-times more intimidating than the titular monster.  These men are two of my household gods, and anything that they are in is immediately worth a viewing.  I hope they never stop!",1214611200,,599,4.622641509433962

This one follows a group of thieves, some local authorities, and a really good looking lady who was taken hostage as they run through the forest to avoid sasquatch. That is pretty much it. It almost seemed as if the same scene was being repeated over and over again. One person would run, someone would chase them, the sasquatch would come flying out of nowhere and take them out. The laughs never stop due to the awful acting and moments where you patently await the next sasquatch attack.

If you are looking for a well made movie then don't look this way. But if you are simply looking to be entertained by some good old horror b then Sasquatch Mountain is right up your alley.",1204588800,,907,4.524390243902439
2680653,4,B000JYW5UK,"I rented this movie and bought some junk food in preparation for a relaxing time with my mother - a fellow sci-fi movie goer.  I am glad that I rented this movie; and I recommend that you do the same.

PLOT: Bank robbers take a hostage and run into woods. Law offices pursue. Eventually, they all team together in order to try to survive - as a sasquatch starts killing them one by one!

REVIEW: I rented this movie expecting a low caliber sci-fi channel movie. While it wasn't a block buster or academy award winner by any means; I think it was the best sasquatch/Bigfoot movie I have ever seen. There is much more plot development; and while there is blood and gore; it wasn't a slasher, mindless blood fest movie.

One of the main characters was ridiculed by the town for 12 years because he claimed his wife saw (and filmed) a sasquatch the night that she was tragically killed in a hit and run accident. It put the small town on some tourists maps and had tv specials on it; but no one really believed him.

The police deputies are rather stereotypical dumb, small town cops. It was a bit annoying but if you didn't harp on that and relaxed, it didn't detract from the movie much. The sheriff is a friend of the afore mentioned main character and he copes with some guilt on not believing his friend and helping him when the town thought him crazy.

The bank robbers are even developed a little; without making the entire movie about them. It wasn't so fascinating that they become extremely memorable (I can only recall about one or two character's names) but it added a little more depth and plot to the movie.

Even the sasquatch has a mate and newborn baby (you don't get to see Baby Bigfoot thought, aw). This sasquatch movie had a lot more plot than others I have seen. Like I said before, its not fantastic, but I am glad I watched it. One of the best Bigfoot movies around.

2680655,4,B000JYW5UK,"I've seen some real stinker bigfoot movies, but I have to say this one is not bad (considering the genre). The acting is decent -- I'd go so far as to call Lance Henriksen ""good."" The film looks good, except for one scene where a microphone is clearly visible. There are a couple of things about the movie that make it interesting for bigfoot buffs. First of all, many of the images of the sasquatch early on are fleeting and show the beast stomping through the woods swinging its arms -- clearly invoking the famous Patterson-Gimlin footage of 1967. In another scene, the folks being stalked by the sasquatch hole up in a rustic house, which angry Mr. Bigfoot bombards with rocks. This calls to mind the famous Fred Beck ""Ape Canyon"" incident of the early 1920s in southwest Washington.

The plot of the film concerns an attractive young woman who, due to an unfortunate car accident, is abducted by a gang of bank robbers and forced to flee with them into the Arizona wilderness. The group is pursued by several law enforcement officers; all must join forces when they learn they are the prey of the sasquatch. Naturally people get picked off one by one, but the gore is not excessive. The portrayal of the sasquatch at the end even manages to be sympathetic.

2680656,4,B000JYW5UK,"A fairly decent Sci Fi film about Bigfoot.  Or more appropriately, about the people dealing with Bigfoot.  This is not a gorefest but rather a throw back to the old idea of running from the unknown and focusing on the characters a bit more.

The ""King"" Lance Henriksen is back in another sasquatch role and judging it by that standard, it is the best lance Henriksen Sasquatch film so far!  Nice to see him being human rather than a robot.  The guy is a good actor.  So are Craig Wasson, Michael Worth and a few others in the cast.  A nice looking film directed by Steven R. Monroe (Left In Darkness). I have seen it ripped on a lot online, but I have to say, much of the critisism was that Cerina Vincent wasn't naked or that Bigfoot wasn't killing enough people.  Shows the criteria that is important to some.  But, that is actually what I liked about it (not that nudity would have killed it....).  I went in expecting something cliche and it surprised me there.  Better written and acted than most in this genre.

It seems there is a featurette on the DVD but unfortunately, no commentary has been listed which would have made it an instant buy.  Either way, a decent low budget flick on the Squatch.",1168214400,,1204,4.418181818181818
