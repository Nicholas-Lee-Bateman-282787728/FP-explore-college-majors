7827938,5,6302574390,"Beautifully sad and one of the finest endings for a anime romance series, remarkable and carefully orchestrated. 5 stars and tears for one of the most emotional endings for a great anime romance series.",1369526400,,202,4.970588235294118
7827939,5,6302574390,"This movie is the actual ending to the KOR series and OVAs. Even though this movie was release first than the OVA, happens later than the OVAs episodes, which have no real chronological order (I only know they happen somewhere between the last 10 ep. of the series and the first movie [this dvd]). In it, the final resolution for the Kyosuke, Madoka and Hikaru love triangle is finally resolved. Keeping always a complete reference and respect (animation, actions, voice, form, etc) for the original series, this movies depicts the moment when Kyosuke decides what he wants for him in order to be happy. With an INCREDIBLE character personification and development, this movie will leave any KOR fan very satisfied. Relationships, its problems and day to day are depicted as real as any real experience one has lived. The music brings back Wada Kanako, which is the same to say that the OST is great if not perfect. This is truly a masterpiece and a good reference for a movie based on an anime series. Normally, these kind of movies fail in capturing the real essence of what was experienced in the anime, but this one is definitely not the case. This DVD edition is out of print according to ADV Films, so if you have any chance to get a copy (as I did), GET IT. This DVD is part of a box set with the other OVAS (dvd) that's why it reads ""DVD 3"" somewhere in the case.",1256515200,3,1371,4.488
7827940,5,6302574390,"After 48 episodes the love triangle finally ends! The end is so raw and cruel but necessary. The characters are so real and all dialogues are full of ""pathos"".The soundtrack is one of the best of all Japan animation! Don't miss the opportunity to see this anime.",1253577600,,262,4.595744680851064
7827941,5,6302574390,"This is a great movie for fans of KOR. But if you've never seen the Kimagure Orange Road the TV series, you will be hard pressed to follow this story, since it truely does end the series.",1242777600,,187,4.081081081081081
7827942,5,6302574390,"After watching the whole series, and after have so many fun, I knew it wasn't to be a good end to the characters and your friendships. But in this movie, it happens to be so sad....anyone who have some affection by the characters will certainly cry and above all you will have so much melancholy. It will mark you.",1129680000,4,314,4.338983050847458
7827943,5,6302574390,"""Kimagure Orange Road: The Movie"" (aka ""I Want to Return to That Day"") is a 70-minute movie sequel to the KOR animated Japanese TV series and is best appreciated if you've seen at least a handful of TV episodes first to get familiar with the love triangle at the heart of the show and its high school-aged participants--earnest young Kyosuke, bubbly Hikaru and the more reserved Ayukawa. The movie takes place during summer vacation as Hikaru rehearses a role in a school musical and Kyosuke and Ayukawa go to summer school to cram for their upcoming college exams. Kyosuke has always been drawn to the more aloof Ayukawa but he's been sidetracked by the lavish attention poured on him by the devoted, somewhat puppy-like Hikaru. Things come to a head this particular summer as Kyosuke and Ayukawa bond at summer school and Kyosuke finally tells Hikaru his true feelings and that he doesn't think they should see each other anymore. The poor, stunned girl cannot believe this has happened and continues to call Kyosuke and seek him out and show up unannounced on his doorstep late at night. Her misplaced confidence tells her that such tactics will insure his return to her.

This is easily the most brutally honest treatment of teen romance I've ever seen--in either live-action or animation--and it's absolutely heartbreaking. Anyone who's ever been on the receiving end of a breakup like this will recognize all the different stages and sheer range of emotions on display.

It's all very beautifully animated, with strong character design and detailed visualization of the concrete everyday aspects of the Tokyo suburb where the action takes place. The music soundtrack includes a couple of love songs by Wada Kanako, an actual singing star referenced in the film. The movie's director is Tomomichi Mochizuki, who went on to direct another superb high school drama, Studio Ghibli's TV movie, ""I Can Hear the Ocean"" (1993), which has yet to see any kind of release in the U.S. The DVD comes with a Japanese soundtrack only, with English subtitles. I wouldn't have it any other way.",1094515200,12,2083,4.931623931623932
7827944,5,6302574390,"""Hey, you in the back row! You should have solved your problems d'amour last year!"" the lecture hall professor shouts to Keisuke.
Keisuke is so mortified he has to laugh. But we, the viewers, laugh because we know the professor has no idea just how right he is. Keisuke has been dragging his heels for more than a year now; he always chokes when he has his chance to let Madoka know how he really feels. It has gotten so bad that he can no longer confess his love and still save face. Meanwhile Hikaru, a friend of them both, is constantly trying to get his attention and affection, with mixed results. The only problem with this movie is that you'll miss a lot if you don't know the background, so there it is.
It seems like a simple comedy/drama about a guy who has no spine and no personality -- a typical male lead character for male audience Japanese anime and manga. But despite that, the story is still replete with symbols, hidden meanings, and deep personality conflicts. There is meaning here for the audience to find.
This movie addicted me to the series. The sound track is excellent too, with great japano rock-pop that has a late 80's sound to it, very mellow and pleasant. The lyrics aren't bad either and appear in the subtitles.
Visually, this isn't exactly Titan AE but they still do a lot with the animation budget that they have. Example: There's a scene with a truck that lasts all of 5 seconds but the truck must have taken hours to draw and color. For food and small items, it seems they use tracing techniques and achieve some very nice effects this way. Yes, the Japanese really are patrons of the arts. Check this movie out if it sounds good to you.",995760000,,1675,4.441558441558442
7827945,5,6302574390,"This is a difficult movie to follow if you haven't seen the series.  The series is also quite difficult to love if you haven't seen the whole thing.  That said, this movie is one of the single best pieces of anime I've ever seen.  It's also incredibly painful to watch if you've seen the series.
The idea of a review is to give you an idea of whether or not this is a good item to purchase, watch, etc.  The problem with this movie is that, while excellent, you really need to have seen the TV (or at the very least the OAV Series) before you watch it.
Is it worth getting the entire TV series first?  Probably not.  Kimagure Orange Road isn't a series for everybody and many would-be viewers will probably be turned off by the first dozen episodes.  I would, however, recommend trying a tape or two of the OAV Series first.  In the Amazon.com directory, they're listed under ""Kimagure Orange Road Vol. 1"", ""Vol. 2"", etc.  They're the ones that do not specifically say ""TV."" Try Volume Three or Four first and see what you think of it.  If you like it, watch the rest of the OVA tapes.  If you're hooked by then, go ahead and watch the two movies (the other - Movie #2 - is subtitled [in the US] ""Summer's Beginning"").  It's a rather large investment to watch just one movie, but I think it's worth it.  Just don't start here if you don't have a fair amount of familiarity with Kimagure Orange Road.  Please.",977011200,,1408,4.324427480916031
7827946,3,6302574390,"Hmmm, I know my title is a little misleading ,I hated this movie because it made me cry so much I was in pain... but that means it's a good movie, and a perverse side of me LIKES to cry.  So if you're a KOR fan or just  like a really sad movie (or if you need proof that men are pigs) you'll  enjoy this.  But if you just got dumped or something, watching this will be  too painful.",949795200,3,382,3.7848101265822787
