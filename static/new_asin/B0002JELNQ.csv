8028273,5,B0002JELNQ,"This is a wonderful collection of some of the greatest films ever made.  It is well worth the price and more.  Besides Criterion restored the films and made them the most watchable they can be.  The two greatest films are directed by David Lean, are British and based on Charles Dickens' books.  Great Expectations and Oliver Twist are wonderful films and no other adaptations compare to them though with Oliver some adaptations have come close twice.  England in these pictures is a dark scary place full of peril and people who can help you or hurt you.  The darkness assists the stories in mood and detail in British life.  England was not the most beautiful place to be during this part of the 19th century.  The stories have never been told so well on film.  Lord of the Flies is a movie I would normally rate about 3 stars but it also is the best adaptation of the book.  Criterion has included amazing extras that taught me more about the director, author of the book and making of the movie than I dreamed possible.  They add to the film and make me appreciate more.  I loved the feature where the author reads excerpts from his novel as the corresponding scene in the movie is played in the background.  Haven't seen that before.  I think teachers would love to use that feature.  The last film is The Most Dangerous Game.  A film I have always loved and true to form, Criterion has improved the sound and picture quality so that it is better than ever.  Joel McCrea and Fay Wray are bait on an island where an insane madman hunts them for sport.  A fun exciting movie that is brought to you by the same team that created King Kong and filmed it at the same time.  These films are wonderful as well as their DVDs.  This is a must collection of great films.",1230940800,10,1765,4.405572755417957
