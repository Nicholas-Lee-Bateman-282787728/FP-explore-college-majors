7905294,1,B000006QDR,"Please note that the above review *seems* to be for the Kirk Douglas movie, ""The Vikings"", not the A&E Foot Soldier series tape.
Anyone looking for an informative and fresh look at the Vikings should certainly look elsewhere (the NOVA videos or A&E's History Channel look at the Viking longships). With this one, A&E has forsaken their usual attention to quality in presenting an insipid attempt at a light-hearted look at history. Bad jokes, sorry rap songs, and goofy re-enactments obscure what little historical information is presented. Literally within the first minute, I knew that I was disappointed to have purchased this video. The filmmakers seem to be more interested in reviewing popular culture's take on the Vikings, rather than enlightening the viewer as to their actual nature.
If you desire to actually learn something on the Vikings, the above mentioned titles are for you. If you are looking for history told with humor, check out Terry ""Monty Python"" Jones' take on ""The Crusades"" in the History Channel's 4-tape set of that name.
I will save you wasting good time and money on this tape by teaching you about all it has to offer: Vikings didn't wear horned helmets.",976406400,23,1186,4.964824120603015
