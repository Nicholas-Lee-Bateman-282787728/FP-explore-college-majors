Memorized all the songs, the lines, the scenes, all of it, that even if I just think of the movie, it plays in my head. I have the songs on my Spotify, and I listen to them anytime I need to feel better, or I just want to hear them again. I love this movie!",1504656000,,441,3.752688172043011
1777454,5,B00006IUH2,"It's a beautiful movie on every level. The animation has aged fairly well, and the backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous. The music is excellent, and is not overused. The acting (primarily by Matt Damon) is superb; he truly gives life to Spirit. It's all top notch, the plot, writing, editing, cinematography, and directing are excellently done. Another plus is that it doesn't water things down. There isn't peace between the US army and Native American tribes, characters get genuinely hurt. There is actual emotion and passion in this movie. Even if you aren't that interested in movies about horses or the west, I still recommend giving this a watch. It is absolutely amazing.",1504483200,,678,5.0625
1777455,5,B00006IUH2,"This film has to be one of the most well put together works of art. The first 5 minutes had me in tears due to the incredible animation and beautiful storyline. I love the art style and the music by Hans Zimmer was a perfect match for this film. Matt Damon made a truly convincing voice for the bold, strong, independent character that is SPIRIT: Stallion of the Cimarron. He is the spirit that could not be broken! woooo!",1504310400,,422,4.3544303797468356

1777665,5,B00006IUH2,"A great movie, my daughter's favorite! Unlike most kids movies, it doesn't treat kids as idiots and strives to be somewhat realistic. The horses are happily are not anthropomorphic (for the most part) and I found out later all the horse sounds come from actual horses which is a nice touch.

In conclusion, a must-have for anyone with little girls or boys obsessed with horses. It's not bad watching it as a parent either, certainly entertaining enough.

I love it so much that, when I was packing for a vacation and realized I couldn't find it, I ordered it and shipped it to my vacation home! Although it can be cliche and unrealistic at times (the horses are so anthropomorphized you can read their emotions from their eyes and mouths), the positives outweigh the negatives.

It came on TV one Saturday afternoon and I watched it.  I loved it!  The last 15 minutes I literally cried.  I love Bryan Adams anyway.  Now I love him more than ever!  This movie is wonderful.  The horses never say words, but the way the animation is done, they don't have to.  We know what they are feeling when they are happy and when they are sad.  This movie was wonderfully done.  Congratulations to all who were involved in making this.  So, what I did was order this and I will recommend it to my 63 year old co-worker and my 52 year old sister.

There is a sense of it being somewhat realistic because there are no magic horses talk speak to each other though human words. Only a narration of spirit but talking to the audience to get a sense of what is happened. Body language used by the horses is how the horses talk. You don't need to be someone who understands body language of a horse to understand what is going on. The soundtrack is amazing in this movie and I love to just listen to it.another thing's love is that the eagle used in this movie used the actual sounds an eagle makes. Not the sound we think of, the might screech of pride we all hear and know. This movie has a realistic plot line and an amazing moral to it that can be interpreted in many ways depending on the viewer.",1465257600,,849,4.182926829268292

The whole theme and plot of this animation, coupled with the absolutely stunning scenery, makes me thrill at the goodness of life awaiting those who refuse to give up.  The statement, ""Spirit. . . that could not be tamed,"" mouthed by the young warrior resounds as an epic reminder that while there is life. . . while there is hope, . . .while there is courage, . . .there is always a reason to run the race, stay the course, and make your own finish in this inescapable game of life.",1457308800,,842,4.593333333333334

Every single song is sung by Brian Adams.

The struggle Spirit goes through in the movie is not unlike the struggles we all go through in life. To me, he represents youth, energy, strength, power, perseverance and boldness. I love these qualities. The movie reminds me, and hopefully you as well, to face problems head on in life. Face your fears boldly in order to find peace and happiness in your life.

If your looking for something different than a goofy movie or same ol kid movie try this one. I work at a preschool. We watched this and they played ""Horses"" for a couple weeks.  It's very unique. Beautiful looking, great story telling. The horses  don't talk but act like real horses. The main character is narrating in a human voice. I guess it's his ""Spirit"". You have to watch it to understand but it's wonderfully done.
Loved it for years with my own kids. Now I love sharing it with others. I actually bought this copy as a gift. I haven't given it to her yet but I'm looking forward to it. I know she'll love it.",1447804800,,720,4.202898550724638

1778124,5,B00006IUH2,"I cant believe how many 1 stars this movie got. Honestly as an adult, horse love (Ive owned for over 10 years) and general lover of animated films this is one of my favorites. Sure the horses have ""eyebrows"" sure the mannerisms weren't quite ""right"" but honestly I think it has more heart then a lot of stuff put out nowadays! I know so many people wanted to point out the ""bad"" whiteys and the ""good"" native americans, how over used it was. I didn't see ""bad"" whiteys..I saw men doing jobs they were told, they needed horses, they had to break horses, its an awful thing to break a horse but thats how it was done ( not that its right of course)...and yes there was violence...they attacked the village accurate for that kind of thing to happen during this time....and the amazing thing is the natives fought back!  Still, it has to have the amazing feats, the hero has to prevail, and this hero happens to be an amazing horse. If anyones ever watched the ending, the colonel actually lets them go! Anyway..just my two cents. Love it! its a great movie to curl up with some popcorn on a rainy day.",1441152000,,1098,4.382352941176471

Who would have thought you could relate so much to a horse? Even without the narration and music, just the facial expressions and body language display such a deep array of emotions.

I watched it again recently with a deaf friend who was brought to tears by the beauty of the story even in silence, while I sang along to the entire soundtrack (still memorized after all these years!)",1427673600,,521,4.602150537634409

1778248,2,B00006IUH2,"Not the worst animated movie Dreamworks has ever made, but not the best, either.

While the main characters' facial expressions were superbly done, the animators at the same time decided not to have any of them talk -because they're horses. The main horse, whose name is Spirit, I guess, does have a voice over, but it just comes off as supremely awkward. I know this movie is probably an allusion to something like racial issues in America, but the entire time it felt like the movie was about the unfair treatment of horses, which would have been funny if not for the cringe-worthy awkwardness that's literally crammed into every scene.

If you want to watch something that looks like it was made by furries on deviantart, then this movie is for you. If this doesn't sound interesting to you then I recommend you look around for something else -unless you actually want to see how absurd this movie gets.

Kids will most likely love it, though.",1425340800,,946,4.686746987951807

Filled with beautiful art work, the story builds around the stallion Spirit who finds himself far from home. Making many friends on his way back, I always find myself learning on my seat as it builds good suspense. Touching a lot of history, it includes native Americans, building of a railroad track, and different methods of breaking horses.
A family friendly adventure, I recomend it to all ages. :)",1415836800,,580,4.586538461538462

1778368,5,B00006IUH2,"I give this movie a five star review because ever since I first watched it, it has been my most favorite movie of all time! I even compared it to the all famous Lion King movies, and this one still won over all. (The Lion King is now my second favorite movie) I liked this animated movie mainly because it is totally unique from other animated movies. The horses don't talk with their mouths moving in odd directions. Instead, you can tell exactly what they're saying by body language and occasional narrations by Spirit, the main character. It is probably one of the most mature animated movies out there, because it also doesn't have goofy side kicks in the way, along with beautiful animation of the American nature.
When I bought the DVD, it met my expectations in an okay manner. The quality of the picture was good, and it also included some pretty good bonus features on how they created the movie. It also has a few games to play with your remote control, which were the only things that were a little cheesy in the entire package. If you're looking for a great version of the movie itself (and don't care about the other features too much), than this is definitely a great buy for you! I highly recommend this movie to horse fanatics and adults alike.",1412985600,,1260,4.506550218340611

I can understand for younger children it can be a bit violent but people complaining about political scrap is ridiculous! Why do people always have to find some angle in everything? Don't get me wrong most everything does have some sort but letting that be the only reason to not liking something is only doing you a disservice. Sure it's a white-men-are-evil thing but in those days they WERE! This movie has beautiful animation, a good story and characters you can get behind.

Almost the whole time you're just listening to Spirit's thoughts, and the Native American when he talks to Spirit.  The horses' expressions and sounds are awesome, it really helps you get emotionally connected.",1405987200,,339,4.810344827586207
1778413,5,B00006IUH2,"Spirit is one of my favorite animated movies! From a young foal to an adult stallion, the story follows Spirit (Matt Damon) through his adventures in the Wild West. Kidnapped and taken from his herd, Spirit tries desperately to get back to his family, meeting both good and bad characters along the trail. I don't want to give any the ending if you haven't seen it! (Which I heartily recommend that you do!)

I love the animation, the storyline, and Bryan Adam's and Hans Zimmerman's music. The only thing that I would have preferred it that the horse's actually talk, instead of Spirit just narrating the story. However, as I said, I love this movie, and I think your horselovers will, too!",1405900800,,691,4.663934426229508

The cinematography, consisting of rolling hills and winding rivers, is not only breathtaking, it depicts that longing within all of us to run FREE....all the while...needing also to connect.

I was also impressed at the way the music captured the hoof-beating rhythm of running free, standing your ground, and of longing. I highly recommend this movie. HIGHLY!",1401062400,,506,5.158536585365853

Spirit is a great example of how many mustangs were affected by the railroad and how cruelly some of them could be treated. He also inspires a feeling of determination, love, and understanding about life and with a friend. I recommend this movie to horse lovers and people who like to watch drama and action animation.

Wooden at best.
I wish the animals talked so that the monotone voice of Damon feeling like a pillow hitting my head with every syllable would stop.
Yes, animals and Native Americans good, Caucasians bad- blah blah blah with the idiotic counter American History schpeel.
My kids loved it and will take nothing of the social PC message with them.
No more than watching Bugs Bunny did as he dressed in drag had no effect on my feelings one way or another about sexual orientation or cross dressing. It was funny.",1389225600,,572,4.563106796116505

He goes off on a miraculous adventure, befriends a Native American boy, falls in love, and overall I believe this movie is one of the best ever made. It took me to another world and enchanted me. This movie is wonderful and overall breathtaking. I believe that everyone can have an adventure like Spirit, but it might not be the same. You cant look into the future, but you can follow your destiny. Spirit taught me a lot of things, started my collection of Breyer model horses, and is truly just one of my absolute favorite movies. I think everybody should check it out.",1387756800,,731,4.462686567164179

I love it because it's one of the only movies I have ever seen where the animals are like real animals and they can't talk. The main character (a horse named Spirit) does have voice narration by Matt Damon, but it's nothing like a typical animated movie where the animals are all talking to each other in caricatured voices and breaking out in song every 6 minutes. The entire soundtrack is Bryan Adams...take that for what you will. :) It's a wonderful movie and the whole family enjoys it.",1387756800,,585,4.327272727272727

1778499,4,B00006IUH2,"I'd give the movie 5 stars if it weren't for the constant, annoying voice of Bryan Adams. However, I do realize that music tastes between people vary greatly, so it might work for you. I do want to clarify, too, that much of the theme music, aside from the actual singing parts, was beautiful and majestic and matched the big, wide-open west depicted in the film. I previewed it before I allowed my horse loving daughter watch it. I was afraid the mentions of ""animal cruelty"" per other reviewers would be too much for her to bear. She is very sensitive, especially when it involves horses.  I think the only thing the captivity did of the main character/horse is prove his rightful name...Spirit who cannot be broken.  My daughter and I found that section of the film comical in some parts as Spirit proved his independence.  Nobody was going to break him.  Personally, I loved that the animals didn't actually speak to one another. It made the horses seem more real, and I know my daughter loved that part of it, too. They were able to communicate, and the audience could clearly tell what the horse was trying to say.  We had fun trying to vocalize the horses' thoughts as we watched the film together.  I highly recommend this film. If you are anti-Bryan Adams...have your mute button handy, but it is still worth the watch.",1381622400,,1328,4.6059322033898304

1778502,5,B00006IUH2,"Yes, Spirit is childish. Yes, it plays with our emotions in unabashedly sentimental ways. Yes, it stretches disbelief (Really? A horse towing a train? That explodes?). But Spirit has one of the best film scores of all time. That's right, you heard me. I said ALL TIME.

This is one of Hans Zimmer's finest scores, and Brian Adams's masterpiece. The songs here are moving, badass, endlessly repeatable, and brilliant. Matt Damon and James Cromwell are excellent in their voicework, and Spirit and the Colonel are still some of my favourite animated characters from my childhood. That *nod of respect at the end always moves me to inner tears.

One thing that really irks me, though, is the way the horses ""talk"". They speak and enunciate exactly how humans would, except instead of speaking they neigh and chuff. This is fine when you're a kid, but when you get older it gets annoying and childish. And the racial depictions are a bit simple.

But hey, enough about cons. This is an amazing cartoon, far better than the CGI crassness like Shrek 4 and The Smurfs that kids watch now. Spirit's visuals are stunning. The landscape should be walking out of a Sergio Leone film or a John Wayne movie. The songs probably germinated from Chuck Norris's iPod. This is a cartoon for the ages. Show it to your kids next time an animated sequel comes out in theatres. This is QUALITY entertainment.

Hey, ""Get off of my back!"", a grown person can like Spirit!",1381104000,,1447,4.707509881422925

1778507,5,B00006IUH2,"Personally, I cried while I watched this movie because it is about a ""family"" of horses.  Mother's can relate to this story because it can be difficult at times to release your children.  This movie can represent many aspects of bondage, without regard to one particular group. Our society face many challenges everywhere, from missing children, (abused or neglected) and many people who are being held against their will. This horse story depicts strength and determination through the pain.  God does not waste our pain. This movie can encourage others to have hope.  I plan to purchase as many DVD's that I can afford, and pass them on to my family and friends.  I strongly recommend this movie. (please forgive errors)

1778511,5,B00006IUH2,"Originally bought the DVD for my kids when they were very young now I find myself daydreaming of the beauty and music in this film. The soundtrack was done by Brian Adams with a small duet on one song by Sarah Mclaughlin. Their vocals give much meaning and feeling to the wonderfully animated visuals on screen.

I lost the DVD version and then purchased the sound track. Now I just purchased the streaming version so I can watch it on a whim. If you're an adult don't let the G rating scare you off.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did have a few little (tiny) marks/scratches on the DVD, however, I did purchase it used so that's not the seller's fault.

1778570,4,B00006IUH2,"One of Dreamworks Studio's underrated 2D animated films, 'Spirit - Stallion of the Cimarron' has a great story and some well-timed drama and comedy.

Although largely unknown or unseen by most audiences (it didn't do well at the box office)  the film became one of my own personal favorite unknown animated drama/action picture. It was also one of my favorite early Dreamworks animated 2D movie. ('Prince of Egypt' and the unfortunately flawed 'El Dorado' are a couple others that impressed me.)

The film is strong on characters and their motivations. Both the animals and their human antagonists really are the movie's strength. They are not only well-defined, believable, and appealing, but also their conflicts seem real and it carries the story well to its exciting and well-plotted conclusion (the audience I sat with when I saw it in the theater in its original release  really locked into this film).

However, the choice of artistic design on some of the characters in this film leaves much to be desired. Better design of the human figures in particular would have given this movie a five star from this viewer.

The early 3D animation mixed into the 2D was somewhat annoying at times. Fortunately, not much time is spent with the film's early obvious less-than-compatible 3D visual intrusion into the 2D world.

'Spirit' is a great family picture as well as good action/adventure movie that can be enjoyed by anyone looking for a real gem that was missed by audiences in its original theatrical release.",1363305600,,1514,4.984126984126984
1778571,4,B00006IUH2,"My kids really enjoyed it, only wish the rental period was longer.  I suppose Amazon could be bait more generous, perhaps offering it as prime 0 viewing.",1363219200,,153,4.666666666666667

1778574,4,B00006IUH2,"Watched this movie with my 9yr old grandchild. I hadn't seen it since it first came out and was impressed with the beautiful animation. She loved it, even tho she's not a horse crazy child. It of course lapses into easy stereotypes of bad white man( an almost General Custer like character) versus the good native American (Noble Savage) .The horses are beautifully animated and scenery is gorgeous. The contrast between the encroachment of  civilisation (in the form of the railroad) and the freedom and beauty of the wild is well portrayed. Better than many Disney children's movies and will engage most adults.",1362355200,,613,4.951456310679611

I had rented it a few times before purchasing it and the one I purchased is an ""unabridged"" version with makes it a longer movie but Oh-So much more complete.
The animation is excellent, I love the detail that they have spent on the scenes.",1361145600,,400,4.194805194805195

1778586,5,B00006IUH2,Spirit is quite fun and smart way to put a animated cartoon. I love all the characters; especially Rain and her Human. Spirit is also full of life and rambunctious and is in dismay with the wild adventures he encounters.,1360368000,,220,4.525
1778587,5,B00006IUH2,"This movie does not rely on flash, gross humor, or 'stunning' visual effects. The cartooning is beautiful yet simple. The expressions in Spirit's eyes make you fall in love from him from the beginning of the movie. It is a feel good movie and tells a parallel story of domination/partnership and what happens from both, the negative and the positive. My daughter loves this movie, I love watching it with her, and my friend has a disabled child that adores horses and loves the soundtrack, loves the movie. Sometimes too much flash from other movies can get to her. Don't expect a Disney experience, in my opinion this is what makes this movie so great. The soundtrack is one singer which makes it sort of a secondary narrative. It is truly a lovely movie.",1359936000,,756,4.649253731343284

Now as an adult I still enjoy watching it on days that I just want to watch something that has no violence in it like most movies in this day and age.

In fact the music composer for both films is indeed Hans Zimmer. And as usual he does a fantastic job. The songs by Bryan Adams are also great and really go well with the story. The real magic of this movie is the fact that the horses are not as anthropomorphic (meaning they don't talk or sing). Their neighs and whines and facial expressions are enough to create their own dialogue in a way that you don't need words to know what they are saying. If Disney had made this movie, the film would be ruined. Overall this is a really beautiful movie and is extremely underrated. The story is timeless and the soundtrack is fantastic. For me its in my top three with the Lion King and Finding Nemo. This is a must own.",1333929600,,851,4.195121951219512

This movie is also fully responsible for my full blown love of animals.

1778647,2,B00006IUH2,"This movie started fine -- nice artwork, baby/mommy horse, those kinds of things.

Then it had my 3 year old son screaming and crying inside of 15 minutes, when the soldiers come and tie the horse up and start dragging him around. Then he is repeatedly beaten, then starved, and shot at. More screaming and crying, more of me hurriedly pressing skip, skip, and trying to explain what was going on...

OK, this is supposed to be a kids movie, I kept telling myself, surely there would be something a little ""scary""... but then it would be over.

As soon as I thought that, then out come the guns -- really? The protagonist cartoon horse in a rated G movie has to get SHOT AT?

The horses get beaten/tied/up/captured just about every 10 minutes throughout the movie.

Because there is also a Native American theme to this movie, we get treated to a cavalry charge slash indian massacre slash redirect into the horses getting washed down a river until you think one of them is dead...

1778649,4,B00006IUH2,"This is a great amazing horse of the wild story, but it's also, the (sad) end of the wild. (Listen to the intro....)
From IMDB
The story that I want to tell you cannot be found in a book. They say that the history of the west was written from the saddle of a horse, but it's never been told from the heart of one. Not till now. I was born here, in this place that would come to be called the Old West. But, to my kind, the land was ageless. It had no beginning and no end, no boundary between earth and sky. Like the wind and the buffalo, we belonged here, we would always belong here. They say the mustang is the spirit of the West. Whether that west was won or lost in the end, you'll have to decide for yourself, but the story I want to tell you is true. I was there and I remember. I remember the sun, the sky, and the wind calling my name in a time when we ran free. I'll never forget the sound and the feeling of running together. The hoof beats were many, but our hearts were one.""

I enjoy the fact that the horses do not speak, like in People language, as in other Disney movies! Interesting! concept! The ending is pretty ... disruptive for small children, perhaps. My child looses interest anyway. She very  much enjoys the giving birth part, the baby horse and the baby receiving mama ""milkies"" as she, as a baby, also received past age one. Mama milk , breast milk is best for growing brains. This milk was made for your baby. Cow milk is made for baby cows. Who wants to give bovine growth hormones, pus, blood, mold, and other additives to their human baby? EWwww!
oops. Off topic.

SPIRIT> The horse movie: .;/ curious, why I order two used copies on Amazon from various vendors long forgotten, and the videos stop before all that civilization annoying breaking the horse and train stuff. It almost reads my mind. But, Does anyone understand WHY the videos keep doing this? Is there something wrong with Pixar? The videos both have original art work on outer and inner DVD. So odd... isn't it? Does anyone else experience this? I lend the videos to my friend and her DVD player also stops at that point. My CPU DVD player also stops on these movies. I don't understand it. I guess we will buy a brand new wrapped movie next time. I thought I bought brand new movies (you know, for the super saver free shipping?) but maybe I'm mistaken. I'll have to find out who the vendor(s) were. so odd.. I usually have great experience with Amazon actually. I've not contacted them yet. I bought these videos so , so, so, long ago...

I actually thought the music was very uplifting! I thought it added to the movie! It was the only way I could , personally, stomach the sad snowfall when Spirit misses his family on the train. This was a very sad movie, actually, but I fast forward, I just can't stand the sad parts. I guess I'm a freak. I like the music! with the movie! So, it's not exactly the kind of music I would listen to at home on my stereo? but for some reason, I think it very much enhanced the movie!",1318896000,,3018,4.2526132404181185

IMHO this movie is a good portrayal of will power and determination.  Although the movie is quite lengthy, it captured my 6-yr old's attention and has remained one of her all-time favorites.  The soundtrack is also excellent and features songs performed by Bryan Adams.",1306195200,,568,5.01063829787234
1778660,3,B00006IUH2,"It's not a bad film. It's not the best one either. Another reviewer writes, ""there's the 'Kind Smart Native Americans' and the 'Bad Stupid White Men.' I mean, all throughout the movie, when the Indian boy got hurt, it was obviously meant to be a matter of concern. But when on the white men got hurt it was supposed to be funny"".

The Native Indians are especially in tune with horses, at least. America's critic, Pulitzer prise winner Roger Ebert, may have seen this film. When he reviewed the film Avatar he wrote, ""The Na'vi survive on this planet by knowing it well, living in harmony with nature, and being wise about the creatures they share it with. In this and countless other ways they resemble Native Americans. Like them, they tame another species to carry them around--not horses, but graceful flying dragon-like creatures"".

My problem isn't with inaccuracies in this animated film; the Spirit, if I may say, of the film travels counter to reality. Horses are native to North America, yes. Native Americans hunted them to extinction. Others are at least partially useful for they reintroduced them to the New World for the wise natives to play with once again. Lets be fair. Others have done things too. Like eradicating Small Pox.

While my review (pointing out that Native Americans slaughtered one another, abused women, and hunted horses to the point of extinction, killing every last one) is not Pulitzer material, it does fight against evil stereotyping. That it does. And for real.",1303689600,,1501,4.87843137254902

What I don't understand are these hordes of people whining about political views being thrown in and how all the Caucasian people were villified.

Everytime someone releases a movie that really makes people think, A.K.A The Blind Side, people scream, ""POLITICS!"". These people are ignorant of real issues and choose to mask this with half-muddled explanations of companies having a ""political agenda"" a flimsy excuse.

Spirit gets taken away from him family and friends in the wild,and is taken into horse training. He's very resistant to this,and thus is treated rather cruelly. He meets a boy who was captured,they escape,yadda yadda. Then,enter the love story.

Don't expect any talking animals either,we only hear Spirit speak once or twice as the narrator.

I am an animal rights activist, and love this movie, it really does show how horses are treated in some areas, but some people get the impression that white people are all bad, and the Indian isen't. Well...its just a movie, don't get offended. The movie should be rated PG in other words too. I have a sister who was 5 when she watched this, haha, most todlers who watch this movie are going to cry!

The DVD itself has a fun, interactive menu and of course the movie is every bit as fun and inspirational as it was when I first watched it all those years ago. I would highly recommend it for girls 4-14 and believe boys could enjoy it, to a lesser extent, from 4-7 or so. Of course, if you're a fan of horses, you'll enjoy this movie at just about any age, and if you're interested in a very different style of animation, I would also suggest this movie for study (there is a LARGE amount of CG models painted over to appear 2D) The music is exceptional and Dreamworks handles it very differently from Disney, so it's a nice change.

If this movie has piqued your interest at all and you're reading this review to see if it'll convince you to or to not buy it...BUY IT. It's worth watching and sharing.",1220140800,,934,4.362068965517241

1778693,4,B00006IUH2,"""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" was a great movie that is worth watching by the whole family. With it's engaging storyline and fitting musical score, this is an inspiring tale of the little pony that could, or I shall I say, did.

 In the beginning we me Spirit, the free to roam stallion of the west. We fall in love with him as we see breif encounters of his early life as comes into power as the leader of the heard. Very quickyly see his first encounter with humans, wich then leads to his captivity. The rest of the movie follows his slow coming friendship with an indian brave, as he regains his freedom and finds his heard.

  The elements that I enjoy most about this movie would have to be the developement of spirit's character, and the greatly enjoyable music. Not only was the music fitting to the emotions and plot of the story, but in and of it's self a work of art. The way they gave human behavior to an animated horse is beyond me. Exept for him narrating, you really got to know spirit's personality throughout the movie.

  Though I greatly enjoy this movie, there are some elements that I didn't really enjoy. There is an element that suggests how evil white people are, that's the only reason that this movie isn't a 5 star for me. Despite that though, this movie really worth watching and adding to anyone's library.",1218499200,,1341,4.467213114754099

One of the great things about this story is that overall it's also a true story about how America really was back in the days when America was home only to the Indians, wild horses, buffalo, and many other FREE wild animals... until the Europeans came over and began taking over the land and turning America into what it is today. From a land of country to the building of the railroads, to the so called winning of the west, this is a fantastic story of a horse's life effected by man to the horse who found a brother in one man as they win back they're freedom together!!

I would like to adress all of the people that hated this movie.  Get an education.  If you don't know this when the ""white man"" tried to break that horse that is exactly how white men do it.  Minus the lack of water and food.  In fact I still think some people break a horse that way.  They jump on it's back and try to break it's spirit.  Sorry to tell you there is no santa.  Did you also know in order to break elephants they are beaten and subjagated and treated incredibly inhumane.  Those sticks that trainers carry around have sharp hooks on them to keep the elephants at bay. They are in fact trying to break it's spirit (and this is happening today). Also Native Americans broke their horses by putting something on the horses back ie.. a blanket then they would slowly try to gain the confidence of the horse before getting on it's back.  White man way ... inhuman.  Native American way... humane.. By the way the white man was the enemy back than read a book.  Just cause your white that does not make you right!  And this movie is not saying Native Americans are better it is trying to depict what a horse could have gone through.  Its not like someone in the army is going to have time to spend with the horse.  The native american had plenty of time to bond with his animal.  And they did capture native americans and torture them for information. I didn't see too many native american 1800 pictures where any living native americans looked too happy if any white man was around.

1778713,5,B00006IUH2,"The only rival to Bambi.

Simple, pure, beautiful story, a poetic portrayal, of the meaning of 'spirit.'

Wild horse, leader of a herd, separated from its mother in its defense, but who, never giving up, escapes its captors and returns home with a mate.

Visually beautiful animation combining hand drawn characters with computer generated backgrounds. Masterfully expressive movements, effectively combining the natural body language of horses with human facial expressions. Sacrifices nothing either to the ideology of having computers do everything or to the ideology of having computers do nothing; it lets the artists' eyes be the judge-and with no meager result. It sets the standard for all future animation.

Though the horses do not speak, story line is meaningfully enhanced by contrasting the culture of western expansionists with the culture of the Lakota Sioux; shows the treatment of the horse in the different cultures. Cavalry Colonel was going to shoot Spirit after failing to tame it; Lakota brave sets Spirit free after the same failure. Treats of the conflict respectfully, not making the Lakota out to be ""savages""--neither base nor ""noble."" Spirit lets the Lakota brave ride him in an exceptional moment during a common struggle; the Colonel, witnessing this, learns to respect both and sets both free--though giving no indication that he intends to quit the Cavalry. The horse in the end simply transcends both cultures as it returns to its home, where--as it was explained in the beginning--the wild horses knew no ""separation between earth and sky.""

Incredibly beautiful.  While the music was not per se my favorite variety, it all but makes me a fan of the genre; the lyrics are very meaningful and it is remarkably well blended into the story on multiple levels--having the right balance between humor, sorrow--and joy.

A few memorable lines from the lyrics:

'remember who you are'

'can't come uninvited'

I've always loved horses, and I've always loved art and good music, and this movie provides a superior combination of all three. The landscapes are breathtaking, the way the horses are animated is excellent, and the music is simply amazing. Hans Zimmer is an outstanding composer, and Bryan Adams helps bring the story of Spirit alive with his deliciously raspy singing voice. Throughout the entire film, you are kept directly on the edge of your seat; there is not a single dull moment to be found, from the beginning all the way to the end.

Granted, one is to expect musicalisms in an animated feature aimed at children, but Adams' style and voice are not to my liking, and since my daughter eventually got bored and left the room, I popped the DVD out of our player and put it back in its case before it had the chance to finish.

I was also annoyed by the ""White people = bad, Native Americans = good!"" meme.  Thanks a lot for that.  As if my daughter won't eventually get an earful of that sort of thing from her so-called Social Studies teachers when she hits school.

You will cry when Spirit is sad, laugh when Spirit laughs, and I think it's really funny when Spirit plays with the horses and people. I have watched this movie 5 times and I'm going to watch it again tommorrow! The movie hardly ever has words. They aren't necessary. You can feel what Spirit is feeling, by watching his actions and the music.

The music, now that is one of the most amazing things about this movie. It shows how spirit is feeling, excited, romanced(by the gorgeous Rain of course), sad, and just plain happy. This is one of the most age appropriate horse movies I've ever watched. I love horses, I tacked up pictures of horse I drew, horse posters, horse pictures, horse calenders, you name it. All I have to say is, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!(and don't believe the people that give it one star, and stuff. And by-the-way, it does NOT have too much violence as one of the raters put it.

Although the music to some Disney movies can be very entertaining, Spirit has a different type of music (more like background music that tells a story, the way Toy Story 1 and 2 have music - the characters are not singing and dancing, which is a refreshing style after seeing so many Disney Movies with the little ones).

You really get into Spirit's heart and enjoy his touching journey.  There was something so real about this movie, that teaches that you form relationships and you learn to trust one another.  It reminded me that we think we know so much when we are young, but as the journey of life is taken, we realize how little we knew way back when.  And there is a lesson to be strong and not to let your Spirit be broken.

The first five minutes made a deep impression on me,the flying eagle,the great canyons,and above all,the wonderful music. But when watching the rest of the movie,I felt no strong emotions any more. After I had finished it,I thought:ahh,it's just OK...but by no means a masterpiece.

However,I loved the music and bought the soundtrack. I listened to it once and once again,and then I realized I liked the movie!

So,I bought the DVD from Amazon and watched it again. Really,this time I fell in love with it. What a good idea it is to bring 2d and 3d together. The pictures are really beautiful. And the story about a gallop for freedom in the wild west...the more I think about it,the more I love it.

Still,I beleive the greatest thing of the movie is its music. If you have listened to the sound track of it,you would agree with me. Even if you say it is a bit too slow,when you watch the movie you will see that the music and the songs fitted movie so well.

I didn't give it 5 stars simply because I would leave it for my favorite---the lion king. However,you can't blame it for not beating perfect.

When he escapes, he is captured by an Indian (with the help of a sexy female horse).  He gains his freedom once more, but the silly filly works her magic on him and ensnares Spirit once again.

1)STORY-ridiculous lies.  I don't even want to discuss it.

2)ANIMATION-horrible.  In trying to make the characters both horses and people, they succeed in doing neither.

3)MUSIC-you know, it's insulting to call what they put into this movie ""MUSIC"".

a ""native American"" even though I am not an Indian?)
is also captured by the evil white military man.
The mustang decides to escape and he also helps
the Indian to escape.  Now, this leads to several
problems in the story.  First, the evil, white military
man who wants to break in the mustang has to ""break him"" so that
he will be a docile horse.  But, on the other hand, Indians
who wanted to ride horses also had to break wild mustangs.
So from the mustang's point of view, there should be no
difference between the white man and the Indian, but in
order to push this pro-Third World ideology, the Indian
is shown to be preferable to the white man, for no apparent
reason other than the fact that he isn't white.  The second problem is: what did the Indians
do when they rode horses on the Great Plains?  They didn't just
do it for fun.  They hunted buffaloes (acutally, bisons), and
fought wars, not just against the ""evil"" white men but also
against other Indian tribes.  Now we are getting into several
problem areas.  First of all, the film tells us that it is bad
to capture wild mustangs, but suddenly we now realize that
it is okay to kill Buffaloes. Isn't that ""speciesism""? That is, we are telling the story only from the point of view of the horse, but what about the poor Buffalo who is a victim of aggression by both the horse and the Indian?  And, as I pointed
out before, the white man is shown to be ""bad"" because he is a soldier, and yet the Indians also fought, although they didn't wear Western-style uniforms.
Finally, there is a scene near the beginning where Spirit, the wild mustang, protects a couple of young colts from a prowling cougar.  Although Spirit succeeds in driving the cougar off, the cougar is left hungry.  Doesn't he have a right to eat as well as the Indian who uses the horse to hunt buffaloes?  This is all getting very confusing.

First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the movie. Second the simple story, and the drama of Spirit gets your attention. One thing I like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now do they?

I grew up with horses, an avid rider, after having a bad accident years ago, i haven't ridden much.  But this has given me a new found appreciation for the horses.  And animals in general.

1778734,3,B00006IUH2,"The Wild West spirit is more alive than ever thanks to the animated feature Spirit.

This movie centers its story on a gorgeous thoroughbred, untamed, energetic and brave, whose days as a leader are abruptly interrupted when American army soldiers capture him.

Even with the best and worst efforts of a tough colonel to tame spirit, the horse refuses to yield his will before humans, and eventually, is rescued by a young Lakota boy called Little Creek.

In the tribe, Spirit has bigger liberties and meets Rain, a beautiful pinto mare that teaches him that not all humans are cruel men.

But Spirit's fate is darkened again when the threatening white man catches him to use him in his infamous plans.

There are enough emotions in Spirit, a film that gives us a simple animation but filled with beautiful landscapes and views of a virgin West.

Curiously, none of the animals talk, except for Spirit who makes the double duty of star and narrator. But this is not a mute film: through it various songs identify moments and specific situations.

With epic proportions, Spirit is a virtuous feature that exalts nature and tries to make us consider about the terrible adversities that many times has to confront. Inspiring and filled with moral lessons, the movie exposes the animal's point of view before the men's sometimes egotistic decisions.

The best lesson is the demonstration of Spirit's unbreakable will, whose heart and integrity are worthy of admiration and respect, even from his enemies, to hold on so blindly to his values and beliefs.",1118966400,,1549,4.908045977011494

My daughter really enjoyed the 'extras' on this DVD.  She spent hours goofing around on the PC.  Her favorites were building a calendar (unfortunately now out of date as the year is hardcoded) and the t-shirt iron on transfers.

Pros: The animation is very good and intentionally not overly CGI.  The Extras are fun.

Cons: The obvious hatred and violence.  There are guns in this movie.  Ok.  We can live with that; Bambi's mom got shot in that classic movie and we all survived after watching it as children.  But this movie shows that White Man is BAAAAAAAD!  What a load of horse apples to keep reinforcing that Europeans were horrid, horrid, bad people and didn't really do anything good - ever.  History is what it is.  The past. And not all full of horrid white people. Why do we need to stereotype all people of similar backgrounds (all indians are good, all europeans are bad)?  I'm not European so don't go throwing this out because of a misconception. I understand the need of good story telling to have good-vs-bad, but once again, Hollywood is using movies as their vehicle to try to change history to try to make some people feel bad.  You CAN have a movie and show people as people.  Not every person of one race is good.  Not every person of one race is bad.  Mix it up and be a bit more truthful.  It makes for a more enjoyable movie when you don't have such blatant stereotypes.",1115078400,,1460,4.482889733840304

This movie contains scenes with guns, shooting and killing, intense chase scenes, nasty soldiers and a seemingly dead horse that threw the 7 yr old next to us into hysterics. Spirit may look like a cute horsey movie for the little ones, but it is entirely innapropriate for the younger set. If you're old enough that the violence and guns don't bother you, you'll probably find the movie insipid anyways. I have no idea who the producers of Spirit thought would enjoy it... no one we know did.",1109376000,,680,4.628099173553719
1778738,3,B00006IUH2,"Matt Damon is a horse.  Somehow they elongated his nose, put extensions in his hair for a mane, and dreamworks pulls it off.  I suppose animation and computer graphics helps along the way.

I had high apple pie in the sky hopes for this movie.  I remember when it came out, it garnered all sorts of good reviews and truly sounded promising as an all-ages family fare offering.  I was disappointed though.  Since we have a two-year old movies we see these days have to be off the G-rated versions.  Of course there are the R-movies to be watched after everyone is in bed but the problem is everyone is in bed including Mom and Dad...so I expect a lot out of my Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks fare these days.  Spirit did not deliver.

The movies true strength was the beautiful sweeping animation with Eagles flying horses running and these truly emotive expressive horse faces that told of dialogue in the absence of words.  The story-line was overly simplified, devoid of nuances, and oh so PC.  It reminded me of ""Little Bear,"" in that regards.  The plot I found lacking for the most part but had just enough drama to keep you watching.

Overall I wouldn't say Spirit was a bad movie, but I wouldn't say it was all that stellar either.  I think horse-lovers and buffs of all things Wild West will get a kick out of Spirit...I'm still not sure where the Cimarron is.  But for family movies that kids and adults will revel in alike, there is better fare out there.

The animator didn't make the mares scrawny, but she made them pretty muscular but allowed the viewer to tell the difference between the stallinod and gelding and the mares themselves. Although this movie isn't based on a real stroy, spirit is actually alive and was based on a real buckskin kiger mustang for reference on anatomy and such. Even if the horses do not talk in this movie, by facial expressions you can tell exactly what they are speaking .. as well as with their body language. The sounds are amazing too. they included the sounds of when a horse is warning another horse, when a horse is scared, happy, excited ..

Rain and Spirit fall forelock over fetlocks for each other, but unstoppable forces drive them apart.

The hands-on or painterly look of traditional animation -- instead of the popular CGI (computer generated imagery) that was used in Shrek and Monsters, Inc. -- seems to have been a significant choice. In doing so, the filmmakers conveyed onto film the same feel that exists in the work of the great Western artists, like Frederic Remington, Charles Russell, and Frank Tenney Johnson. It's familiar and refreshing at the same time, but the really amazing feat is that of the horsey heroes. Their faces are rather stylized (horses don't have eyebrows, folks!) and their eyes have been made with human-like sclera showing to help facilitate a range of expressions, but as someone who knows horses very well, I was continually amazed and delighted by the accuracy of the horse's movements in all gaits, and even swimming and rolling. It's breathtaking.

The DVD's additional release material includes audio commentary from directors Lorna Cook and Kelly Asbury, plus a bonus short ""Learn to Draw Spirit with James Baxter"", and a featurette ""Film Music with Bryan Adams"". There is also the obligatory film-to-storyboard comparison, and an interactive game called ""Make-A-Movie Studio"", which I could not get to work...

I just saw the movie with my son - 2 years after the film's premiere - and was just shocked how great this film was!  The film's previews made it look amateurish, with wan-looking characters, generic-looking scenery and childish plot.  Boy, was I wrong.  This is the most MATURE of any recent animated film to date, by which I mean the breadth and intensity of passion, suffering, and redemption of the principal characters, matched by the central theme of indomitable spirit that founded the Native America and the subsequent USA.  The facial animation of the horses were rendered with such extraordinary skill that the producers did not have to resort to the annoying cliche of wise-cracking donkey, etc.  All of the characters are endowed with diginity befitting the grand epic drama, and I found myself tearing up in the last 10 minutes of the film, which was incredibly moving.  (In contrast, ""The Incredibles"" was pure eye-candy but did not make me laugh or cry.  In the context of incredible hype, ""the Incredibles"" did not measure up to its title.)

Overall, ""Spirit"" is a rare jewel that is still relatively hidden beneath the mountain of better-known animation cliches.

1778744,5,B00006IUH2,"I thought this movie would be crap (and I'm a horse lover) but it's not. The basic plot is: spirit is a beautiful and wild stallion who lives with his mother and herd in the wild west. One day, however, all that changes when he is forced to sacrifice himself to save his herd members from being caught. Taken by some cowboys, he is given to the US army. Here spirit is treated cruelly because he won't be ""broken in"" (let some one ride him.) meanwhile he meets little creek, and Indian prisoner. But with the help of each other the two escape, with spirit expecting to return to his homeland, only to find himself caught by the Indians. At first he hates them, and is confused why a beautiful paint mare named rein gets on so well with them, but soon he will have many more choices to make, and an incredible adventure before he can return home. This is a perfect blend of 32 and 2d animation and I wish all movies where done like this! Funnily enough, the horses don't talk, but they don't need to. you can tell what their saying just from the look on their faces and the sound of the neigh. There are some scenes when the horses neigh but you actually ere their ""voices"" in your head saying ""no!"" or whatever.

I love how the horses communicate via neighing and Spirit's innermost thoughts (voiced by Matt Damon).  Bryan Adams' music is wonderful!  I'm ready to buy the soundtrack now.  My daughter loves the movie and I enjoyed viewing it as well.

Personally, since I am not a politically correct type person I am not worried about whole Indian vs. Calvary scenes.  There's plenty of movies that have shown the other side as well.

I've also been reading other reviews, and to tell you the truth I did not notice the 'kind indian' and 'cruel whiteman' thing.  I mean it doesn't really matter; indians were kind at times so were whitemen.  White men were cruel at times, so were indians.  Who cares??  Also about the eyebrow thing: Does it really matter if horses have eybrows? It's a cartoon, how else could they express the horses?

I loved the movie, and I want to buy it.  I also loved the music in the movie (Sound the Bugle was by far the best song). I will most likely buy the soundtrack.

1778748,5,B00006IUH2,"""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" is one of the most beautful animated films I've ever seen, and in some ways this non-disney produced film actually out-Disneys DISNEY!

Based on an old Indian legend, Spirit is the majestic stallion of the Cimarron Herd. The story unfolds in the time shortly before the War on Independence in North America. When the handsome buckskin is snatched from his home by humans, a journey begins for Spirit to find his way back. However, along the way he befriends Little Creek a spontanious young Indian and falls for Rain, a stunning skewbald mare. Soon, Spirit realises that he is torn between to worlds and chasing one dream will mean sacrafising another.

Before I saw this movie, I definately had my doubts, mainly because in my eyes Disney animation is the best and there is simply nobody who can beat them. However, on this occasion I had to admit there were times when I was actually COMPARING ""Spirit"" to Disney films. That's a major first for me!

The movie is very original in several areas. Firstly, unlike  ANY animated film that I can think of, the main character doesn't speak, but conveys his inner thoughts and emotions through an occasional voice over (Matt Damon) and musical ballads by Bryan Adams. Believe it or, this unusual method was even more affective than the common way and added to the movie's greatness.

In addition to the music, the score by Hans Zimmer (""The Lion King"") is absolutley beautiful! The many melodies are incredibly clever and you can listen to it without ever getting board - you might even cry a bit! Bryan Adams' songs are very beautiful and support the weight of the film evenly and cleverly. All the songs are catchy and emotional, as they ultimately capture what Spirit feels and thinks. My favourite song is the inspiring and swooning ""Sound the Bugal"".

I was also highly impressed by Spirit and the horses' animation. As none of the horses' actually spoke (except for their neighing), eyebrows (which horses DONT usually have!) were used to such effectiveness that you really could understand exactly what was going through the animals head. It has also been proven that horses are the hardest animals to animate because of their complex bone structure and the way they move. This hurdle was conquered with revolutionary computer effects and by mimicking real-live horses through cameras (very similar to how stunt horses were created in ""Lord of the Rings""). So in that sense, the specail effects were very well done.

In conclusion, ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" is a breath-taking, epic feature that I enjoyed immensly. Do not be put off by the fact that it is not a Disney film, because this film is every bit as brilliant as classics like ""The Lion King"". For horse-lovers, you will absolutley die over this film. Even for non-horse-lovers, this is still a beautiful film with a powerful message for everybody - that friendship and love will always get you though hard times. This is trully a beautiful film with a free and original spirit!",1091923200,,3034,4.845559845559846
1778749,4,B00006IUH2,"Most girls love horses. Many boys do too. So do quite a few grownups. My daughter is one with them all, and this is one of her favorite films. Probably everyone who loves horses will love this film.

 Spirit is a splendid stallion, his story set in Colorado about 150 years or so ago. He is a magnificent creature, the proverbial horse who will not be broken. Captured by US Army soldiers and coveted by an Indian brave, Spirit compromises his otherwise uncompromising character long enough to be freed from the Army encampment and meet Rain, a paint who becomes his other passion, second only to his freedom.

 The most interesting thing about this film is that, unlike almost any other animated feature, the animals do not speak. Actor Matt Damon does the voiceover, speaking Spirit's thoughts for us, but otherwise only the humans have voices. Another noticeable item is the Bryan Adams soundtrack, a pop/rock set that, like Adams himself, is always adequate without ever making any attempt at originality.

 At the forefront, of course, is the animation itself. Some unusual techniques are employed here, most memorably the scenes where the film is drawn as if it were live action filmed in a helicopter flyover. Really a striking effect. The detail achieved here, such as the rippling muscles under healthy horseflesh, is often outstanding.

 Ultimately I'm not overwhelmed with the greatness of this movie because of several things. The Adams songs are one thing, and the cliched story line is another. Kids won't care about that and will love the film intensely in spite of them. But an explanation is needed also, due to the heavy-handed /all white men bad, all red men good/ racist tones that are implicit in the conflict over who gets to be friends with Spirit and his clan. Sure, there have been past abuses, but reverse racism is not the answer. With this one serious misgiving, it's quite a glorious film.",1090627200,,1918,4.844036697247707
1778750,1,B00006IUH2,"Spirit claims to tell its story from the horse's (""Spirit's"") point of view. Instead, it tells a story from an all-too-familiar, all-too-human perspective: That of a cross between radical multiculturalism and animal rights fanaticism. And so, we have morally superior horses, and evil humans who seek to break the horses' spirits. But not all humans are evil: The Indian is one with nature, loves horses, and frolics with Spirit, as if he too were a horse. It is the Evil White Male, who hates horses, imprisons them, and is a danger to nature. (And yet, Spirit's voice is done by Evil White Male, Matt Damon!) The movie makers' desire to impugn white men (or their flat-out ignorance) goes so far as to depict a cowboy roping Spirit's leg. Wranglers don't try to rope a horse's leg. If a wrangler even COULD rope a horse's leg without the rope slipping to the ground, it would break the horse's leg, requiring that the horse be shot.
And the animation is as one-dimensional as the storytelling. Look at the water, when Spirit is in the river. Blank. Compare that to the water in Walt Disney's 1940 Pinocchio; it's full of reflected images. Note too the crude animation when the horses are running together. This ain't Pixar. This is just racist, propagandistic dreck, that didn't fool my three-year-old for a second! Whereas he wanted to see Pinocchio again and again and again, he never asked to see this a second time. In the days of the original Pinocchio, many children's movies were characterized by intelligence, moral weight, and yes, spirit. Today, we get this.

It's boring, uneventful and the animation is no better than any other Dreamworks flick out as of right now.  The characters aren't likeable and there are very few fun moments in the movie.  I will have to say that the attempts at breaking ""Spirit"" were funny, but that's about where it ends.
The story moves at an agonizing pace.  Forty minutes into the movie, the pace picks up a little bit.  Other than that, the lack of dialogue leaves you wanting more.  I'll give Dreamworks credit for attempting to use music as the horse's ""voice,"" but Bryan Adams must have really ticked off a Canadian official to end up on this sinking ship.
The DVD extras aren't all that good either.  The games didn't respond well to my remote, and the documentaries on the music and movie were just put in to allow the production team and Hans Zimmer to gush over themselves.  They should keep their comments to themselves.
In closing, I hate to knock a movie so hard, but this movie is bad.  I wouldn't feel right telling a person how great it is when it really isn't that amazing.

Il team Dreamworks confeziona cos un film politicamente ipercorretto dove, ed  sempre meno raro nella cinematografia statunitense, vengono ristabilite delle verit storiche addebitando ai bianchi la responsabilit della fine della civilt nativa americana e dei disastri ambientali perpetrati sul territorio. E' da salutare con entusiasmo inoltre un film d'animazione che per una volta lascia agli animali le loro caratteristiche ed il loro linguaggio anche se ogni tanto si fa largo l'impressione che la voglia di antropomorfizzare i cavalli sia stata forzosamente soppressa. Tecnicamente ineccepibile il dvd, restano delle perplessit solo sulla versione italiana dei brani di Bryan Adams: Zucchero appare francamente fuori posto, specie nel brano conclusivo, dove appare chiaro che con la voce proprio ""non ci arriva"".",1077408000,,1375,5.481132075471698

1778755,4,B00006IUH2,"OK, so it is a wee bit on the corny side - horses are not able to do some of the things the horsey hero (Spirit) in this story is capable of doing; a horse with quite human-like intelligence. But, quite frankly, I didn't care. It was a great, fun story with a wonderful, feel good ending. The animation was beautiful, even breathtaking at times. It is a movie I would have liked to have seen on a big screen actually. I watched this movie with a 12-year old neighbour (it was her's, and she wanted me to see it; I think it was a sort of ""I'm sorry"" for having subjected me to the horrendous ""8 Crazy Nights"" the day before, lol). I was as enthralled as she was!  I am not a Bryan Adams fan, but the music fit the story well. I personally wouldn't buy the sound track, but a Bryan Adams fan would enjoy it.
The only slightly annoying thing (probably just to adults) was the continuous whinnying. While this made sense since it was, after all, about horses, it did become a bit much at times. At least the horses didn't talk like humans. The animation and story more than made up for any of the longer whinnying scenes, however.
Most of the story was told in the eyes of the horses which were animated in wonderfully expressive ways. Every emotion was expressed successfully; bewilderment, fear, anger, sorrow, and more. A real tribute to the talent of the animators.
I am sure that no-one will regret purchasing this movie - it can be enjoyed by children and their parents alike.",1074816000,,1478,4.374545454545455

There has not been a day since we purchased the DVD that she has not BEGGED to watch it.  I'm not a huge fan of animated movies, but I have to say that this animation has done a pretty good job of making the horses real (aside from the wide range of facial expressions that they have!)... they don't talk to each other in words like in other animal films but are still able to convey mood and emotion in their own language.  I think this movie has a lot of great messages and has truly captivated my daughter. The extras on the DVD version are pretty fun too... we practiced drawing spirit with the artist and colored him in.

1778757,3,B00006IUH2,"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a visually beautiful story about Spirit, a wild mustang, who gets caught by cowboys.  The story is about Spirit's struggle for freedom and through his struggle he meets several different characters and learns the lesson of freedom.  Throughout the story Spirit is mute, which provides a feeling of authenticity.  However, this is what makes the film a little sluggish, since it balances on a thin line between serious and comedic where there is almost no dialogue.  The film offers a good moral cinematic experience through Spirits adventure, but fails in keep the audience's attention due to lack of staying on track.",1072483200,,654,5.08411214953271
1778758,5,B00006IUH2,"I was prepared to be disappointed in this film.  I am not normally a big fan of animated movies, especially those which depend on anthropomorphism (look it up!) to appeal to the kids.  This does take the animal's point of view but it does not talk down to the audience, not even when Matt Damon does the voice of the main character.  In fact, the story is told more through the non-intrusive music of Bryan Adams and the absolutely spectacular score of Hans Zimmer than it is through the voiceover.  (Note: Adams and Zimmer were ripped off in not even being nominated for an Oscar in 2003.  Ah well, Zimmer already has won for The Lion King, but I feel bad for Adams who deserved to win for Best Song.)
Look for stunning animation, some of which makes you wonder how they did it, even with computers to help them.  Listen for great music.

1778759,5,B00006IUH2,"Spirit is one of the most moving, well-written and beautiful animated feature films ever made.  I absolutely loved this movie and so did my 2 girls, ages 2 and 3.
I loved the story about a wild and freedom-loving horse who experiences plenty of adventures as he gains and loses his independence--at the hands of humans who unsuccessfully attempt to tame him.  Spirit has often finds himself punished for his adventurous spirit, but his stoic personality and determination keep him seeking a state of freedom.  Spirit reminded me so much of the child in all of us, who just wants to be free, peaceful and independent.
I thought the movie had wonderful life lessons about conformity or being ""tame""--and how sometimes it isn't always an admirable thing.  I also loved Spirit's resillent personality.  He experienced many losses in his life and even abuse--yet he perserveres and continues to seek freedom--even in his darkest hours.  I loved that Spirit's spunky innocence repeatedly won over the brazen machismo know-it-all humans in the film.  Spirit truly represents the beauty, wonder and moxxy in all of us--that sometimes is squashed under societal pressure.  Spirit reminded me that staying true to yourself--despite what others want you to be--is essential for a meaningful, happy life.
The animation was breathtaking and realistic.  Water is difficult to animate, and the river and waterfall scenes were absolutely gorgeous.  ""Spirit"" is full of beautiful scenery--billowing grasses, glassy icicles, exploding forest fires, craggy canyons, dusty, colorful landscapes and the most beautiful snowfall ever depicted on film.  There is also a powerful action sequence that combines realistic 3D animation, lifelike sound effects and compelling visuals that rival any live-action film.  I was blown away.  In addition, there are many tender and emotional moments in the movie that were accentuated by the wonderful expressions of Spirit and the beautiful scenery.
The music was meaningful and pleasant as well.  I've never been a Brian Adams fan--until Spirit.  The songs are beautiful and fit with the story well.  My children were mesmerized with the music and repeatedly ask for the songs to be played again and again.
I highly recommend Spirit.  This action-packed animation feature film has plenty of heart, meaningful messages and a feast of eye candy.  Spirit is truly a magnificent work of art.",1071532800,,2404,5.2650918635170605

And the western landscapes are the one positive thing about the movie.  But I was flabergasted as the scenes shifted from Yosemite to Yellowstone to Monument Arch as if these were all in the same neighbhorhood.  I found it annoying.
Byran Adams has written some good songs . . . elsewhere.  The tunes in this film are insipid and all sound alike.
The concept of having the animals not speak was an interesting one.  Except that then Spirit speaks to the camera in voice over.  What were they thinking?!!!!  And as some one with a little experience with horses, the horse sounds were ludicrous.

1778764,1,B00006IUH2,"Most modern animation understands that the audience consists of a range, from the four-year-old to the forty. Unfortunately, Spirit doesn't. While the animation is professional, the plot and especially the music is excrutiatingly contrived and summarily uninspired. As soon as I heard the voiceover by Matt Damon, with its portrayal of an idyllic (and unrealistic) West, I knew we were in trouble, but it was the raspy singing of Brian Adams accompanying the playful antics of the young Spirit that moved this film from the category of being not just a bad idea, but simply bad.
Perhaps a young child might be enthralled by this movie, able to ignore the inane lyrics and the predictable story. The animators did their anatomical and behavioral research, and the horses actually act like their live counterparts, for the most part. They rely a little too much on the eyes (portrayed slightly enlarged and with much more white around the eye, which is simply wrong) and the mouth (seeing the colt smile grated on me as much as Adams' voice), rather than trusting the body language. And, sure, they don't have the animals speak, but there's that narration that undercuts the whole point of not ascribing human communication to the horses.
We had successfully avoided this at the theater, but Jill received it as a gift and we thought, ""well, how bad can it be?"" It's that bad. Go get Shrek, or The Prince of Egypt, by the same studio instead of this stinker.",1064016000,,1456,4.828

Plus you have 15 songs in this movie pefromed by Bryan Adams, which includes a duet he does that plays over the end credits.

When we go to a museum, she only looks at pictures of horses.  And the horse in this movie is badly behaved -- kicking a great number of people, and several get kicked in the face.  Our daughter is always lining up people to kick in the face.  I have myself been kicked about fifty times due to this video and haven't appreciated it.  I've spoken to her many times about this only being a story, and that the people the horse kicks are bad, while we are her family, but then she just says I'm a wild horse!  I'm a wild horse!
For people who are trying in some sense to tame their children this video offers a bad example.  I'm thinking seriously of banning it in our house.  Is violence a good answer to teach to children? That's what this video teaches.  It's extremely violent, and justifies this by showing that violence is only an answer to the greater violence of the soldiers, etc.  I would recommend that people stick with The Wiggles, Pooh Bear, etc.",1057881600,,1125,4.434146341463415

The animation is truly awesome -- from the opening sequences showing a bird soaring through the Grand Canyon to the very last scene. The characters in this story are easy to care about, even though the horses never speak in words. Instead, the lyrics of the songs give voice to the thoughts and feelings of Spirit as he finds himself on a long journey in the days of the American ""wild west.""

As soon as he saw that these animals weren't going to speak or make him laugh, he moved to another room to watch Dragon Tales. While I agree with other opinions that the quality of the animation is excellent, I don't see how a small child could possibly follow this movie unless they have a VERY CLEAR understanding and bright vocabulary of facial expressions and body language. I understand the opinions of some reviewers when they stated that it was refreshing and more emotional to see the animals communicate non-verbally. I personally enjoyed watching it (once) BUT, I definatley wasn't intrigued enough to ""pop it in"" since. Frankly, I was shocked to see all the positive reviews.

1778773,4,B00006IUH2,"The opening sequence of ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron,"" in which an eagle flies across the grand vistas of the American West until we catch up with the herd of wild mustangs in which the title character lives was used quite effectively as the trailer for this film, in much the same manner as was done with the computer animated film ""Dinosaur.""  The comparison is particularly apt because when I saw ""Dinosaur"" I was disappointed that all of the characters talked; I thought we would be seeing the equivalent of a prehistoric Disney nature film.  In contrast, I was pleasantly surprised that Spirit and the other horses in this animated Dreamworks film did not talk.  There is narration on Spirit's behalf by Matt Damon, but the music of Han Zimmer and the songs of Bryan Adams serve as the horse's voice as well.
Overall, I think the filmmakers more than rise to the challenge of telling a story without talking animals.  This is not a cute cartoon in the grand Disney tradition and ""Spirit"" is much the better for it, with the expressiveness of Spirit's face exceeding anything you have seen before.  The story is set in the Old West and tells the story of Spirit, a wild mustang stallion who comes into contact with humans: first cowboys, then the U.S. cavalry, and then Indians.  Each group thinks they can tame the wild stallion, but they underestimate their opponent (just branding the horse proves to be an insurmountable obstacle).  Eventually Spirit learns to distinguish between the heavy handed colonel (voiced by James Cromwell) and the young brave Little Creek (voiced by Daniel Studi).
Yes, Spirit emerges through these adventures as something of a super horse, constantly doing the impossible, but holding animated films to the standard of reality is hardly appropriate.  Spirit symbolizes the imperative of freedom and as such ultimately earns the respect of the mere humans in his story.  The result is not a great animated film, but certainly a very good one that should appeal to adults as well as children, and since the film only runs 83 minutes long it should not tax either age group that much.",1055548800,,2122,4.8397790055248615

I agree that the sensitive preschoolers should wait a year or two to view this one.  Nothing really bad - perhaps just scary for a young one.
I enjoyed the fact that the horses didn't ""speak english"" but winnied & neighed and communicated with each other in their own way.  Sort of lets the viewer decide what they are really saying to each other.  The narration tells you all you need to know - the rest is left to your own imagination.

1778776,5,B00006IUH2,"I enjoyed this film so much I later bought a copy of the video and the soundtrack. The animation is superb -- I love the way they have Spirit rearing while the rest of the herd gallops swiftly past him, and the wind blows his hair about in a very realistic way. The music is terrific, and the horses move and sound like real horses. This is a great film to watch if you enjoy seeing pictures of beautiful wild horses running free in green meadows. The opening scene, where you follow the flight of an eagle through the American west -- is breathtaking.
Spirit's story is riveting and heart-warming -- his saga keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end of the movie. One of the saddest scenes is when he's captured by the cowboys who turn him over to an army general (the voice, oddly enough, belongs to the same guy who played the gentle farmer in ""Babe."") The general treats Spirit cruelly by depriving him of food and water for three days in the hot sun, hoping to break his spirit, which he fails to do. But then Spirit escapes with the help of a new friend, Little Creek, a kind and considerate Indian brave. Little Creek's horse, Rain is a spirited and charming paint mare. At first she and Spirit have a clash of wills, but later they develop a strong bond. Spirit is kidnapped again during an army raid on the Indian camp, but he escapes and meets up with Little Creek, and they return together to what is left of the camp. I love the ending of the film, when Spirit and Rain run back to Spirit's herd and are standing together on top of a hill with the wind blowing their hair.
Delightful as the film is, however, there is a note of warning: The horses in this film do not talk, but communicate by neighing, snorting and whinnying. If listening to these natural horse sounds for an hour or so drives you crazy, you might want to steer clear of this film. I've spent a lot of time around horses, so I know what these various sounds mean, but other people might not. However, I think it's an unusual -- and refreshing -- approach to an animated film.

I have two problems with Spirit.  First, the soundtrack, and second, the unveiled hippy revisionism of the plot.
The full horror of the soundtrack cannot be described in words.  You simply have to hear it to believe it, and then, of course, it is too late.  Take my warning... better to imagine the rasping of fingernails across blackboards or the repetitive thump of a basketball in the neighbor's driveway at 2 am.  Bryan Adams manages to craft a sonic enema the likes of which have fortunately been limited.  If the DVD had some way to turn him off and just hear the dialog, it would jump at least to the tolerable level.  Abandon hope, all ye who listen.
Secondly, the plot reeks of California new-age aquarius revival.  Let's see... the Native Americans live as one with nature in a perpetually blissful environment, communing with all around them in the embrace of the Great Manatee (or Manitou, or whatever).  The wild horses (Native themselves, because in this tale they were definately not introduced by the Conquistadors) also live at one with nature, with only snakes as their enemy.  Playful buffalo dance and frolic in the everlasting spring of a ""new world"" (why it is ""new"" to the Natives is beyond me, but I suppose ""It's a new day, it's an old world"" was confusing to poor Bryan).
And then all is sullied by the intrusion of the portly, cowardly, clumsy and mean spirited White Male Oppressor, dressed in a cavalry outfit for good measure.
The rest of the plot is predictable - Horse + Indian Brave battle sinister Custeresque Cavalry Nemesis.  They also manage to prevent the transcontinental railroad from despoiling the virgin land (which leaves some explaining to do - but why let history interfere?)  The only plot twist that disturbes this luddite/pagan fantasy is when Evil Custer-Man has an unexpected Change Of Heart.
Anyway, the political undertones are to be expected from DreamWorks (or Disney, for that matter), so at least I knew what I was getting.  I can take the time to explain to my daughter about left-wing propoganda.  What I will never be able to explain away is Bryan Adams.  I think to myself - ""If only I had read the cover!  If only I knew Bryan Adams wrote the soundtrack!""  And yet, this is delusion.  For I would have told myself ""So it's Bryan Adams... it can't be that bad.""

But here is a animated wonder that can stand with those films  ""Spirit"" is full of captivating visuals, textured characters and a well-composed, if somewhat conventional story.  But what really stands out about this movie is the fluency of the images that pass by on the screen.  It is the images that tell the story of the film, and there may be a grand total of less than 200 lines of dialouge, mostly spoken from the many fleeting human characters that populate the story.

Spirit (whose thoughts are voiced by Matt Damon, no talking animals here) is a Stallion born and bred on the virgin plains of the American frontier in the mid 19th century.

Also along the way, Spirit meets workers on the Transcontinental railroad, and a Lakota Souix boy whom he grows to love.  But above all, Spirit hopes to return to his herd
It is amazing the work Dreamworks has done to combine traditional hand drawings with computer generated images.  Though sometimes choppy in their execution of this art, Dreamworks animators  mostly combine the two well.  Spirit's chase away from potential captors in a canyon is a perfect example, as is Spirit dashing away from a runaway locomotive.
One final thing:  You don't have to bea horse lover to appreciate the film, even though the whole film is set around a touchy horse!  The sprawling landscapes will arrest you, and the story will keep you in your seat the whole running time, which is less than an hour and a half.

The movie has action, comedy, a little romance (between Spirit and a Paint mare named Rain) and tons of amazing animation.

You will not regret it!",1046908800,,545,4.934782608695652
1778787,4,B00006IUH2,"Spirit is more of a celebration of art, animation, nature and freedom than a fulfilling story. If you love movies for their artistic qualities, you will be in horse heaven.

The ""Tradigital"" type animation is a blending of hand drawn traditional and computer animation. The combination produces spectacular results. I loved the scene where Spirit and the mare are swimming in the lily pond.

The treatment of the stallion did have some cruel elements, but for the most part, Spirit does basically run free and is happy. Spirit also gives the humans a bit of a tossing about, so all seems fair in that regard and he seems to get his revenge.

What I did worry about was that children would think that anyone who owns horses treats them cruelly. Which is not the case. The horse is treated cruelly by the Calvary. However, one wonders if when breaking in a wild horse, it would have been done any differently in reality. From what I've seen in regular films, it could be worse.

I was trying to figure out the double meanings in the story because I felt it could not just be about a horse. Was this a fight for artistic expression without rules or a fight for individual freedom or a fight against the system? There seems to be a strong element of rebellion expressed by Spirit which is not normally seen in most animation that I've seen. Perhaps they were just emphasizing the feisty nature of a stallion.

This movie seems to have been an experiment as none of the animals talk. Spirit doesn't talk and in this story and narration is by Matt Damon. Bryan Adams sings all the song and the words reveal Spirit's thoughts. So, for once you have to actually listen to the words of the songs to know what the main character is thinking. I like Bryan Adams voice, so enjoyed the movie for that element.

Otherwise, I really think this movie needed a beautiful Native American princess to brighten up the movie.

If you are in love with animation and want to take a visual journey through the West, this is gorgeous beyond all belief. I can only compare it to Princess Mononoke in regards to the scenery.

The waterfall alone is worth the price of the DVD. I mean, they really did spend a great deal of time on making the animation absolutely perfect. I wish they would have spent a bit more time on the plot and included some women (ok, so there is a mare) as main characters in the story.

The storyboards, animation details and ""learning to draw"" activities add an extra element and if you want to find out more about animation, they provide an fascinating behind-the-scenes look at making an animated movie.

 When i watched this movie, I was feeling depressed and discouraged. But by the time this movie was over, I knew that My spirit could overcome anything that the world dealt me, just like ""spirit"" did in the movie.

1778794,5,B00006IUH2,"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is not only beautiful and breathtaking in its imagery and animation, but amazingly accurate in its portrayal of the Old West. Whether we want to admit it or not, early American settlers did forge a trail across this continent that changed its landscape forever. To be politically correct would be to deny the events of this history.
As a horse lover, I found it refreshing that the writers chose not to give the horses human voices. To have done so would surely have taken away from the film's heart.
As for one 12-year-old reviewer's remarks about the definition of ""Buckskin"" and ""Paint"" horses, I recommend researching Kiger mustangs, the models for Spirit, which range in color from Buckskin to Dun and which all are characterized by the black dorsel strip along their backs. These horses are direct descendants to 17th century Spanish mustangs and are today strictly bred to maintain the integrity of their bloodline. A good place to learn more about these true wild mustangs of the west would be springwaterstation.com. Also, the American Paint Mustang, before Paint horses were recognized as a ""breed,"" were referred to as paints by Indians long before anyone thought to breed them for their unique markings.
The methods used to break wild horses to the saddle in Spirit may seem brutal, but how else do people think it was done, especially by the United States Cavalry? Many of the same methods continue today with horses that prove more difficult to handle than others. At the same time, there are those who believe a more gentle approach works just as well.
Overall, I thought Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was an amazing depiction of the West from a unique perspective before it was conquered by civilization. Viewers should enjoy it for what it is, an animated tale told without talking horses that sound an awful lot like prominent actors, one that was developed with considerable thought and care to accuracy.",1044316800,,1959,4.921450151057402

Along the way, he meets and falls in love with a paint filly named Rain and befriends a young Lakota Indian.  It is amazing to see how much he will do to save his homeland- even get sent to the cavalry, risk being broken, being chased down a mountain by a steam engine, and having to outrun a wild fire!

I loved all the facial expressions; I've worn half of them myself!

My kids love the movie, and I don't mind watching it with them more than once.
As far as the soundtrack goes...just as with all great movies, this soundtrack is worth listening to with or without the movie.  It's a combination of Hans Zimmer (Gladiator) and Brian Adams, and contributes significantly to the mood throughout.

Unfortunately, the achilles heel of this movie is a weak, heavy handed story that seems more bent on political correctness than on telling a tale.  There's nothing wrong with a storyline that exposes past injustices but this movie uses it as an offensive weapon in the finest tradition of propaganda films.  Ultimately this renders the picture inappropriate for younger viewers, which is a shame because it's an otherwise an excellent movie.  The animated feature Ice Age also takes a swipe at the way mankind has treated animals in the past, yet unlike Spirit it manages to do so without getting bogged down in its own sense of self-importance.
My suggestion?  If you're an older viewer with a strong feeling about animal rights this is the film for you.  If you're looking for something to entertain your kids, pass this one up for Monsters Inc. or Ice Age.",1041897600,,1065,4.955056179775281
1778804,5,B00006IUH2,"""Spirit..."" is a realistically done movie. The horse doesn't fake-talk to others. His expression is through body language, facial expression, and genuine horse sounds.

He faces challenges like being taken against his will and leaving loved ones behind, so that he can be tamed and used for work. However, along the way, he makes an indian friend, finds his true love, regains his freedom, and makes his way back to his family. The narration in the story is adequate; the animation is fantastic...very expressively done; the music does an excellent job setting moods and helping to tell the story.  Although there will be some viewers who are not ""horse-lovers"", I think that once you see the spectacular animation, listen to the songs, and follow the story, you will agree that this movie is indeed realistic. I don't know that DreamWorks could have done it any better. Hats off to Hans Zimmer (music composer) and Bryan Adams (songwriter/ singer)who did a marvelous job writing and performing the music for Spirit.

You know a film is great when your kids immediately grab their toy animals and start playing Spirit and Rain right after the film is over.  My five and three year olds had no problem with the film's alleged intensity.  And with all due respect to the other reviews here-reviews are always subjective anyway-I felt Bryan Adams was the perfect choice.  His songs fit Spirit's thinking and ties Zimmer's score together emotionally quite well.  Mr. Thomas's review claims there is a ""big dose of political correctness.""  Any educated person will be relieved to know that what Mr. Thomas deems as ""dose[s] of [pc]"" are merely honest portrayals of native people and soldier culture.  If it's ""pc"" to portray a native person as a decent human being and the Lakota's horse culture for the highly evolved civilization that it was, well then, so be it.  This sort of demonizing cultural accuracy as ""political correctness"" nonsense just needs to stop, it's the 21st century already. If anything was distracting for me as an adult, it was the frequent geography snafus-the Cimarron is in northeastern New Mexico but the soldiers continuously talk about Nebraska and Utah (an impossibly wide range) and the Little Creek's Lakota village is located in Yosemite Valley... NOT (The Miwok lived there not the Lakota).  There really is no good dramatic reason to mess around with details like that.  My only gripe with the DVD widescreen edition is that the DVDROM games don't work on Mac OSX (must we all be slaves to inferior Gates'ware?).

Once you get past the horse's eyebrows, there are very few things in this movie that took me out my acceptable limits for cartoon horses.

But that's basically what drives the main theme of the film - the inconquerable power of the human (yes, human) spirit.  Basically ""Spirit"" is a metaphor for the strength of the human spirit (""The Spirit that cannot be broken"").  Look, I'm 38 years old, my favorite films include One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction, Mulholland Drive, etc, etc.  This movie is a drippy, melodramatic, campy powerhouse of an animated film and I enjoyed the heck out of it.

1778824,5,B00006IUH2,"When my brother bought this DVD recently for his sons I didn't think too much of it thinking that it was just some cute little cartoon about a horse for kids.  Nothing could be further from the truth however.  I found the move so powerful that after about half way through the film, I found myself holding back tears.  The sound track by Brain Adams accompanied by Matt Damon's narration (Spirit's thoughts) and the story line make this a powerful and important film for children and adults.
This animated masterpiece is about a wild horse's personal struggle to overcome oppression.  He never gives up regardless of his circumstances.  Throughout the film, Spirit finds himself in oppressive circumstances at the hands of cowboys and other whites who wish to denie Spirit his freedom.  Along the way, Spirit befriends an American Indian who finds himself in similar situations.  As Spirit and his friend endure all kinds of hardships, Matt Damon narrates Spirit's thoughts and feelings and Brian Adams sings songs that fit every scene perfectly.  The singing and the narration go on throughout the film in the good times and in the bad times.  Stories about the struggle against oppression are very inspirational and educational particularly when they have a historical basis.",1038873600,,1277,5.042857142857143

1778826,5,B00006IUH2,"""The story I am about to tell you cannot be found in any history book...""
The opening words of Spirit, stallion of the Cimmaron, set the tone for a beautiful journey through a wild, Western America of 140 years ago.
Spirit is a young mustang stallion who is defined by his swift grace and freedom to run along the Great Plains and canyons.  He is captured and enslaved by Calvary troops at a local fort, where the Captain is determined to break him into a trophy riding horse.  Through an unexpected partnership with a Dakota brave, who is also a fellow prisoner there, Spirit escapes, only to be returned to captivity among the Native Americans.  But there he meets Rain, a mare that challenges him to care about others beyond his herd - including the ""two-feet"" who wants not to break him, but to claim friendship.
This film was like a cool drink of spring water among the soda pop offerings in feature animation of the last few years:  simple, refreshing, and perfectly necessary.  Instead of the usual wisecracking banter that has come to dominate this genre (and, oddly, is way over the heads of the intended younger audience), we follow the story with a simple narrative provided by Spirit's voice, which is never actually spoken in the film's dialog.  The horses all communicate with natural equine noises of whinnying, neighing, snorts, etc. and through easily readable facial expressions and body language.  In this way, Spirit's struggle to reconcile his desire for freedom verses newfound love is heartbreakingly obvious to us.  And Spirit himself is transformed into a metaphor for pure joy during a gallop.
Don't worry, SSotC is no slouch when it comes to action (it is amazing to me that the film's artists could so seamlessly combine the several adrenaline-packed chase sequences through such realistic - and gorgeous - scenery).  I knew it had passed the ""boy-friendly"" litmus test when my four-year-old son was inspired to jump up and run circles around the coffee table shouting ""Run Horses, run!"" The animation itself is neither overly cartoony nor tediously detailed, but elegant and convincing for both action and emotion.
SSotC is destined to become a family favorite because it really does have something for every member of the family to appreciate; drama, thrills, and a celebration of our shared American heritage.",1038700800,,2340,4.948979591836735
1778827,5,B00006IUH2,"A triumphant tribute to the divine equine spirit, executed with passionate artistry and technical excellence. Oscars upon Oscars upon Oscars to the team from Dreamworks for their groundbreaking fusion of traditional and computerized animation techniques.
The beautiful backdrops and environmental effects will transport you into the boundless big-sky country of the old west. Everything feels so real in this film that it barely seems like 'animation' at all, in the traditional sense.
The exceptionally well studied horse characters have subtle elements of charicature added to them which give the characters an ability to pass on their thoughts and emotions to us without saying a word. There are times when the equine communication is so clearly emoted that you can almost hear the individual words of the unspoken dialog.
The story itself is a desperate action-romance where Spirit struggles to capture and retain the three loves of his life: his mare, his herd and his homeland. Folks have said Spirit is unoriginal and predictable and, well, it'll be no surprise to you that he faces challenges, experiences loss, has a dark night of the soul, acheives a new determination and eventually rises to conquor his situation and bring us a happy ending. But that's not the point. Spirit doesn't have the plot of 'Usual Suspects' or an episode of 'Alias', it's not meant to. Its a story of a classical Hero character in the Wild West tradition. As a horse, Spirits motivations are simple, and the storyline follows that.
The bad guys are 'mean' but not evil and there's nothing here to frighten your young ones. There's no terrible cruelty or violence just edge-of-the-seat action, soulful and beautiful scenes accompanied by emotive (if not exactly unfamiliar) songs by Bryan Adams, and passionately felt depictions of the spectalular vistas that compose the classical old west.
The DVD comes in with variety of languages and subtitles and some really neat extras. There's a fascinating voice commentary by the directors, short programmes about the music composition and the artistic skills and techology involved which really makes clear just what a miracle this movie is.
There's also a fantastic art tutorial with James Barter the lead animator. He'll show you exactly how the horses of Spirit are drawn. Kids and horse-fans with an artistic streak will *love* this, its really useful.
If you have suitably equipped player or DVDROM there's also a feature that'll let you build your own short Spirit films from cut'n'paste animation segments and backdrops.
In short, I cannot recommend Spirit highly enough. Its simple story and the open-faced motivations of its characters will not suit you if you're looking for a movie to keep you guessing or challenge you intellectually but I'm convinced that its incredible beauty and the state-of-the-art techiques of its construction will have it recorded forever as a significant peice of animation history.
Just remember, after you give this to your kids, they *are* going to be asking for a pony for Xmas ;)

The music is beautifully done, so subtle and moving that sometimes you forget there is music. The way the story is told, from the view point of Spirit WITHOUT him talking, is done so artistically and sensitively! It has great morals and lessons that we all can learn from. Not to give up in the face of doubt, not to let society change us from who we are. It's a beautifully mastered film and will be cherished for years to come!",1038441600,,715,4.226277372262774

This is the story of a wild horse named Spirit who was captured by soldiers and wants to protect his land from them.
This is such an amazing and fascinating animated movie that features no talking animals, but only the people talk; Matt Damon narrates as the title character as well. The animation is unique, the computer graphics are realistic that it puts you right in the movie, and the soundtrack by Bryan Adams is the best soundtrack I have heard this year.",1038355200,,636,4.6875
1778831,3,B00006IUH2,"The animation, stunning landscapes, beautiful skies and amazingly well done water sequences makes this movie a joy to watch.  The animators get a 5 plus for the very beautiful job they did in this film.
The problem I have with this movie is the bit unconventional way that the story is told.  The main character, Spirit, does not have any talking dialogue with the other characters, rather he narrates throughout the movie.  He does make horse noises and gestures to other animals and to some of the human characters, and while these bits of sign language, body language and horse sounds are easily understood by the adult audience, I don't think they are as captivating to the younger viewers as simple dialogue could have been.
The animators did a wonderful job in conveying information through facial gestures and body language, and like the Sea Witch says in The Little Mermaid ""never under estimate the power of ""body language"""" it is true that a ton of information is conveyed.  However, in movies such as The Little Mermaid the other characters continued to dialogue so that some of the story is still be told by a seagull, a crab and others.  In this movie the interactions between Spirit and the beautiful mare he meets are limited because they never actually speak to each other, in fact Spirit never actually ""talks"" to anyone except to  the audience as a narrator.
I think the makers of Spirit took a big gamble when deciding to limit the dialogue to the couple of human characters in this movie, which in fact isn't much dialogue, because most of the talking is in monologue form and really simply mirrors Spirits narration.  I applaud the artistic achievement in this film, but I also recognize that many of the younger viewers are going to be a little left behind while watching and may not be as engaged as they might have.
There are some interesting bonus features on the DVD, and a young girl or boy interested in drawing animated characters should enjoy the clips on drawing an horse.  I give a recommendation on this one  to anyone enjoying well drawn animation and to the age group of probably 7 to 11 (give or take) assuming those children enjoy horses.",1038355200,,2175,4.7026315789473685

The time frame when he's in the Indian village is odd since they roached his mane at the Army post & it grows back in the village so you aren't sure just how long he was there for, several months or over a year since it would take a year or 2 for a horses mane to grow out again.

We've got the Nice Indians being tormented. We've got the moment when you think Spirit's girlfriend-horse is killed. In addition to the excessive drama, we have fun for the adults, too! We've got Bryan Adams singing every three and a half seconds, which could make any adult cry. We've got awful PC revisionist history, which could make any adult feel ill. I would rather be poked in the eye with a hot sharp stick than watch this movie again. I need to sue the studio for the hour and a half of my life that I can never get back.

1778835,2,B00006IUH2,"""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" breaks with tradition a bit by having its animal characters be less anthropomorphic in nature than is customary in most feature length animated films.  Indeed, except for an occasional voiceover on the part of the main character, the horses in this film never speak (only the human characters do).  In many ways, one respects this effort to keep the film more true to life, but the decision to take this approach ultimately ends up ruining the film for the adult audience (not being a five-year-old myself, I will not endeavor to say one way or the other how this film will play with that member of the audience).  For a film aimed at children, it is striking to discover just how humorless most of ""Spirit"" turns out to be.  There are no singing teakettles or furry little wiseacres to provide the comic relief we often need to get us through some of these films.  Without the wit that made ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Shrek"" as much fun for adults as they were for kids, ""Spirit"" leaves its adult audience high and dry, stuck with a story that is as old as the hills, with nothing but a few good action scenes to keep us from falling asleep.
The problem is that, when the main character is essentially unable to communicate with anyone else directly - having to rely almost exclusively on soulful glances to convey all his emotions - the conflict and drama of the story tend to dry up.  And the conflict itself is so simplistic that one wonders if the filmmakers expect their audience ever to have seen a movie before (for many in its young audience, this may well be the case).  We're introduced to Spirit and the rest of his herd living free and undisturbed in the great Far West, when into the picture come the evil, dastardly white settlers who want only to corral the horses and use them as beasts of burden (I hate to quibble over historical realities here, but weren't horses extinct on the North American continent until the Europeans brought them back over?).  Of course, even though the whites are all uniformly brutish in their treatment of the horses, the Native Americans are portrayed as loving and respectful towards Spirit and his brethren and spiritually at one with them.  The PC meter runs dangerously high at times in this film.
In terms of animation, ""Spirit"" has a certain elegance in its backgrounds and colors, and its action scenes are executed with a fine fluidity and flair.  The first fifteen minutes or so, before the arrival of the humans, offers promise that the film will take flight as a charming adventure tale.  When the men make their appearance, however, the movie becomes confined and static, with Spirit having to endure hardships, for what feels like ages, tied to a post.  After that, the film never recovers that sense of wide-ranging openness it has at the beginning.
There isn't much else to say about ""Spirit,"" except, perhaps, to note that the Hans Zimmer score (crooned by the lugubrious Bryan Adams) is both maudlin and undistinguished.  ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" may be fine for horse-loving children under the age of eight.  The rest of us, however, might prefer to find an animated film that engages both the mind and the funny bone and leave ""Spirit"" for the kiddies.",1038096000,,3256,4.689473684210526
1778836,5,B00006IUH2,"I really enjoyed Spirit, Stallion of the Cimarron! The animation was pretty, the plot engrossing and the emotions of humans and their horse companions well portrayed.
Spirit is a young buckskin stallion, the leader of his herd. Raised by his mother, a single-mom palomino, Spirit has never before met a human until he spies a distant campfire. Overcome with curiosity he investigates, only to find a group of soldiers and unhappy horses in bridles and saddles. Overcome with mischief, Spirit taunts the men, with disastrous consequences: The men follow him back to his own herd and threaten his mother and friends!
Spirit leads the men away from his herd, only to be captured and taken to the human fort.
I found this movie to be moving, the graphics pretty, and the tale a young horse 'remaining steadfast and holding true to his belief in freedom, despite imprisonment, ill treatment' quite engrossing.
The only thing I DIDN'T like about Spirit was the sound track. Bleh.  Bryan Adam's nasally whining was awfully and did not suit the tone of the movie at all. (A folk musician, or a Native American artist would've suited this film more).

I applaud the decision not to have the horses talk. And Oh they didn't sing either! Thank goodness! There were no goofy sidekicks, no bawdy humor, no 'bad-guy-falls-to-his-death' and no mothers dying in the first third of the film. Our family was joking about what a certain big studio would have done with it if they were behind it.
The main antagonist is just that. He's not particularly bad, he just has his methods (I didn't like them and you probably won't either). I love the contest of wills between the two. Especially when you think Spirit has been broken -Right in the middle of the Colonel's speech you find out he isn't!
The blacksmith sequence is a scream and you find yourself cheering for Spirit.
Anyone who is around Spirit very much ends up respecting and accepting him as a horse who will not be broken.
The one part of the film that rather bothered me was a railroad camp part. I wondered if the filmmakers were anti-railroad or anti-progress. Our nation was literally built by the steam engine. In the director's commentary they explain they weren't trying to make a negative statement about railroads they were showing how it would appear from Spirit's perspective. Much as I like trains I would not want them laying rails in my backyard!
I love the cameos some of our national treasures (National parks)put in. This film is a feel good rendition of the old romantic image many of us have of the old west. It's like a beautiful animated painting that I will enjoy seeing again and again.

Not only was the animation beautiful, and the music fantastic, it had an important message about how cruel humans can be to animals, and that a little kindness to an animal, can benifit both human and beast. Even though the indians used ropes and tried to ride Spirit, they were kind and loving to him,especially the boy, who understands his need for freedom, and eventually sets him free. One reviewer referred to this movie as ""smaltz"" which I strongly disagree. I don't know how a person that negative can like any animated movie. They aren't supposed to be entirely realistic. They are supposed to have strong characters, and teach valuable lessons about life. I feel sorry for that person. He/she misses the point entirely. And the first reviewer liked the movie, but said it was foolish and childish to like movies with talking animals. I disagree, they are again ""make believe"" and meant primarily for children. Adults can enjoy them too. They just have to be open-minded and let their inner child out. I never lost mine, and I'm not ashamed. But in the case of this movie, dialogue between the animals wasn't necessary, because their emotions were  expressed so obviously through the context of the story, expressions and movements, not to mention, the lyrics of all those great Bryan Adams songs. Perhaps this would've worked with ""The Lion King"" and ""Dinosaur"" too, but that's just not the Disney style, and it doesn't make me like those movies any less. Those are both favorites in my home. You have to judge each movie on it's own merits, and not compare it to others. This is one great movie, and I plan to add it to my collection. Even very young children can sympathize with Spirit's plight, and admire his courage. Great job, Dreamworks. I also agree no sequel is necessary, but I don't think it would ""ruin"" this movie.

During the Western era, people use to straddle the horses and literally break their 'spirit' in order to make them obey.

Do you realize how well this would have worked with ""Dinosaur""? The opening moments of ""Spirit"" captivated me almost as much as the 'egg scene' in ""Dinosaur""! Gorgeous, flowing images are like a dream. I wonder if the DVD cartoon will hold the same spell over us as the theatrical version did? Can't wait!!",1034812800,,605,4.509090909090909

The plot was bland and too politically correct for my taste.  Horses aren't that smart, either.  They wouldn't know that railroads would be built in their territory.  And what is Spirit?  A super horse?  Horses are strong, but they're not James Bond.  Besides, these horses had eyebrows and they whinnied too much.  The ""wild and free"" thing is sentimental and insipid junk!

I got the soundtrack in June for my birthday, and I'm in love with ""Sound the Bugle"" and ""The Long Road Back"". Both songs makes me tear up, it's so sad! Especially towards the end of ""The Long Rock Back"" with the big violin crescendo. Some parts in the movie made me smile, like when Spirit was a colt and came face to face with the buffalo herd. Other parts made me cry, seriously, like when Rain got hurt. I loved the part where Spirit played dead when they were hauling the train engine, it was very clever. Over all, I really love the movie and the soundtrack. I'm definately buying the DVD when it comes out. 10 out of 5 stars!",1029110400,,773,4.125827814569536

My girlfriend and I saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it. We invited a couple friends to see Spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot. When I asked our friends to come along to see it, they thought it was a movie about horses, but afterwards they realized it was more than that.
I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Lil' Creek and Rain a lot.  Lil' Creek reminded me of Nathan Chasing Horse, a Lakota Spiritual Leader and movie actor who is Smiles A Lot in the movie Dances With Wolves.  Spirit is a symbolic, inspirational and empowering movie.  I enjoyed seeing the indigenous Lakota people in their tribal villages, and I really liked hearing them speak in the Lakota language.

1778862,5,B00006IUH2,"Simply put, this film is amazing in every aspect of the word. Filled with top notch animation (and I mean REALLY awesome), true to life characters and strong messages. But the best part is that the horses don't talk! It is outstanding what the animators have done to get around this: the body language and expressions of the horses are made so intense they almost seem real. For me this was the movie's highlight, the way how all the horses' emotions were conveyed through very careful observation on the animators' part. At parts it seems as if you can actually feel Spirit's anger and confusion, or Rain's alarm, or Spirits' mother's hysteria.
As stated before the animation is groundbreaking, with the grass, dust, fire and water almost seeming real. But the crowning glory of the film is probably its message - that freedom is everything.
The film is far better than any of the new Disney features and feels rather like one of the good old Disney classics, such as Pinochio, a visually and morally rewarding experience. A sure contender for the 2003 Best Animated Feature catergory!",1026950400,,1086,4.81283422459893

I was nervous about taking my 2 year old daughter to see Spirit, cause she doesn't like to sit for long periods at a time.  My mother actually talked me into taking her to see this and she LOVED it!!  She sat through the whole movie without complaining or trying to get up.  She and I were both enthralled watching the wonderful animation and colors, watching Spirit fight for his freedom and his herds safety....and we both laughed when Spirit was at the Fort and they were trying to ""induct"" and ""ride"" him.  I cried twice throughout the movie and there was never a dull moment.  All in all my daughter and I have seen Spirit four times and we never tire of seeing it.  The soundtrack is also just as amazing as the movie and my daughter recognizes what it is when Bryan Adams just starts singing his ""Here I am""!  We are Spirit crazy here at home, and will definetly buy Spirit when it comes out...I have a feeling Spirit will replace Scooby Doo in my daughters heart!",1026345600,,1062,4.410256410256411
1778864,3,B00006IUH2,"After such great Animated DreamWorks films such as Antz, Shrek, The Prince of Egypt, and Eldorodo, DreamWorks Pictures brings out Spirit.  A tale about a horse who lived during the old west and is narrated by Matt Damon.  What I really don't like about this film is that the main character in this film, the horse, does not talk as in most cartoons about animals.  So yes, this movie is more true to life by having the horses not talk, but then why is it that this story is told by a narrator who is supposed to be the horse Spirit.  If not for the soundtrack, this movie would have been a total bomb.  Brian Adams does a great job of telling the story through the lyrics in his songs.  Where most movies just have music that may or may not have anything to do with what is going on in the film, you can actually listen to the music and not watch the movie and know what is going on.  Save your money and wait for this one to come out on VIDEO.",1026086400,,944,4.0978260869565215
1778865,4,B00006IUH2,"A lot of reviewers made a big deal of the fact that the horses in this animated film do not actually talk.  In all honesty, that's scarcely a blow for realism in full-length cartoons, since the they're still pretty anthropomorphized.  They give each other all-too-human looks of affection, sorrow or jubilation.  And of course, Matt Damon's voice over lets the viewer know just what the stallion is really thinking.  So in that sense, they may as well be talking horse sense to each other.
Still this is an impressive work of animation.  Children should love it and parents will likely not be bored.  The blend of computer generated and hand-drawn techniques seems to be pointing the way to the future of the art of animation--and it looks pretty darn good.
Of course, the story is something of a PC-fantasy.  Neither the wild horses nor the American Indians fared quite so well historically as they do in the film.  In fairness, however, the movie doesn't actually indicate that Spirit's victory is any more than a temporary one, and it would almost be mean-spirited and too much to ask of a young audience to have the film end on a more somber note.  Moreover the movie probably provides good historical discussion points for parents of somewhat older children.
Recommended for all but the very youngest viewers (i.e. if they're too young for ""Bambi,"" they're definitely too young for this).  Otherwise wild horses shouldn't keep you away!",1026000000,,1441,4.868852459016393

1778867,5,B00006IUH2,"I saw Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron on May 24, 2002, opening day. And I have never seen a movie like this.
First, let me say that I have waited for this movie for about six months, ever since I saw its short trailer that was shown with the Shrek video and DVD. Since then I have eagerly anticipated its arrival, and today finally was able to revel in the movie's gorgeous characters, stunning animation, superb plot, and hilarious antics.
I could begin by telling you some of the plot, but I believe that is unnecessary. Plenty of commentors have already done that, and the trailer for the movie shows enough as it is. If one goes to the Spirit fansite, one can learn nearly everything about the movie.
I went into the theaters already knowing the first half hour of the movie, thanks to my lousy habit of browsing through the different sites dedicated to this movie. Although I already knew most of the movie, I was still speechless. The cell animation and hand-drawn art is utterly seamless, just like the creators have claimed. To put it plainly, Spirit's animation is perfect.  Only one flaw have I found, but even this flaw is nothing compared to the true essence of Spirit.
The true essence, or essences, of Spirit, is/are the beautiful, extremely realistic horse characters and its music. The horses act like real horses. Of course, we all know by now that they don't speak English (or French or German or Italian), but they really do speak. They are intelligent in the movie, with the squeals and neighs comprising their language. They speak, move, look, and FEEL like real horses. The animators and screenwriters have put so much effort into creating these magnificent characters.
At first, when I heard the songs by Bryan Adams on the soundtrack, I didn't really like them. But now that I've seen their places in the movie, I cannot get the songs out of my mind. They are perfect for the movie. And if I went on about Hans Zimmer's music, this comment would be the length of a few miles. Zimmer has composed such an eloquent, vivid score that tells its own story. Without his music, the movie would feel empty. It is the score that helps bring it alive.
Matt Damon is a great guy for the narrator. He knows just the right tone that will put one into the ""mood"" of the movie. Its almost as if he really is Spirit, as if he was more than just a narrator.
It's obvious now, isn't it? Spirit is the best of 2002. No other movie will match its friendliness, its vivid characters, its loveable tale, and its legendary score and plot line. If you want a movie filled with nothing but endless entertainment and a great feeling that just lingers for hours, Spirit is for you. So is the soundtrack.",1025913600,,2701,4.534836065573771
1778868,4,B00006IUH2,"Spirit is a wild stallion who happens upon the wrong places, at the wrong times. He is first captured by U.S. Calvary and barely escapes with his life, thanks to the help of a Native American named Little Creek. Spirit soon falls for Little Creeks horse, Rain. Bu Little Creek wants to ride Spirit as much as the Colonel did. He soon finds though, that he and Spirit are kindred ...um... spirits, if you will, and no one should ever ride the magnificent, wild Stallion.  While constantly being pursued by the U.S. forces, Spirit and Little Creek have adventures across the wilderness,  until the crisis is finally resolved on the Colonels terms.
  Spirit is a wonderful family film from the folks at Dreamworks. Much better than shlock like Shrek. Dont get me wrong, Shrek was funny, but it also was little more than Katzenberg poking fun at Disney for the length of an entire film, instead of making a worthwhile NEW story. Spirit IS a wonderful new story. Simple, yes, but beautifully done, with wonderful characters, few as they were. The only flaws with this film are, mainly, the songs. Spirit is decorated with loud, unnecessary, and totally inappropriate pop songs from Bryan Adams. This is nothing against Bryan Adams, I just think maybe he needs to avoid animation entanglements. In fact, I wish animation and pop songs would come together a lot less often. But anyways, they were the main scourge of the film, but also, the movie might have benefited from a touch more comic relief here and there. On the other hand, Disney usually is the only one who does comic relief right in animated films (though they failed for the most part in Atlantis), so maybe they went the right route here. But the bottom line: Dreamworks still has a ways to go before they are up to Disneys level in my opinion, but they still have some wonderful films, and this is definitely one of them.

1778870,5,B00006IUH2,"I am a lifetime horse owner/lover/fanatic and was expecting to be able to pick apart this movie and point out the flaws in the animations compared to real horses.  I was wrong (well I did chuckle at the colt lapping water).  They did an excellent job of making the horses look real...better than real...more lovable than real...I want one:)  I was not expecting to absolutely LOVE this movie and want to go see it again and buy it when it came out.  Being a pediatric nurse I have to stay up on all the animations, you know, and I was assigned the job to see if it was suitable for my nephews.  This one is going to go down as one of the best--it is less violent than Lion King and has much more of a story line and educational impact.
I watched it with a horse trainer friend of mine and we were not the only adults watching this movie without kids.  I found it hilarious and entertaining.  We found ourselves laughing and chuckling, ""I want that horse.""  I wished it could go on longer, but I guess it is a kid's movie.  The animation is second to none.  The characters really had expressions.  I was not the only one being drawn it and getting misty eyed in the theater.  The bad guys were bad (but not as bad as Lion King, Aladin, etc.) and the Good guys were honorable.  They did a wonderful job telling the history of the west without making it real, I mean scary, for the kids.
I'd have to disagree with the amazon guy.  Think about it.  This movie is designed for kids, oh, about 5 years and up.  Most of their parents rocked out to Bryan Adams in the 80s and will welcome the music since they will be hearing it over and over again once this movie can be purchased!  The music fit the movie and helped make a real emotional impact for the viewers.  I already bought the sound track!
This movie had it all for me: Action, comedy, suspense, drama, a story line, and a love story suitable for kids and simple enough that made us adults wish it was that easy.  I haven't felt that good walking out of a movie in a long time.
Now I only have one question:  Where can I buy one of these horses!!!",1024790400,,2099,4.2

All I had to do was log on to the dreamworks web site about this movie and hear the soaring music by Hans Zimmer to know the movie would be great, and I wasn't disappointed. The movie has a lot of social commentary, about slavery, pride, loyalty, friendship, breaching racism, history (skewed or not) and etc.
It was a lot of fun, it was an adventure. You can tell the filmmakers reached for an adventure because Spirit explicity tells you ""thus started my adventure."" And off we went, to meet many interesting people and see far away places.
My wife cried through a lot of the movie...that's got to be a good thing.
The story proceeds forth with a minimum of dialog and monolouges. Much of the story is masterfully told with subtle nuances, facial expressions and body language.
I gave this 4 stars because it still does not reach the stratospheric heights of ""The Little Mermaid"" or ""Hercules.""",1024704000,,1041,4.602150537634409
1778872,2,B00006IUH2,"I don't normally see many animated films but the previews of this movie showed such wonderful animation that I had to see it. The animation was truly great.  The sweeping vistas of the West and the scenes of the galloping mustangs were everything I expected and more.  I also liked the creative and interesting way the creators used the body language, facial expressions and non-verbal vocalizations of the horses rather than human speech to convey conversation. I think kids will enjoy this for the most part, but there is a lot of trauma for the hero mustang to get through. I thought that Bryan Adams soundtrack detracted from and intruded on the movie. The lyrics were corny and the 80s sound of the music made a discordant note each time it surfaced. There were several awful cliches that I'd prefer not to see anywhere, least of all in a children's film. We see a female brown and white pinto using her feminine wiles to tame the rugged wild mustang. (We know she's a hotty because of the long blonde mane, forelock and tail, the big blue eyes and the coquettish postures and facial expressions.) He can't escape her charms and he gives up his ""masculine"" freedom for her. When the Native American hero character first comes on the screen he is dragged up to the post commander at the fort who says something to the effect of, ""Not as tall as the Cheyennes, not as fine of bone as the Crow...a Lakota."" If that isn't bad enough, pretty much everything else concerning Native Americans is either exaggerated or false or cliche. I won't reveal the ending because it would spoil the story but I will say that it is totally absurd and paints a very untrue resolution to the ""taming"" of the West. This movie is after all, a children's movie and so of course I didn't expect realism or anything like it, but falsity is another matter. The action sequences were all completely and totally impossible which would be okay for a truly cartoonish plot, but this is portrayed as semi-realistic, quasi-historical. I do not recommend it even though the artwork is beautiful.",1024617600,,2066,4.673076923076923

It had something for everyone: suspense, action, romance, and of course, great music. I've always liked Bryan Adams and these songs were right on target with his style of music. The expressions these animals showed through their facial features and gestures were very humanistic and you could relate to what they were feeling.

1778874,5,B00006IUH2,"First of all, I need to disagree with the Amazon reviewer's opinion of Bryan Adams, the ""80's rocker,"" who contributed to the soundtrack.  I feel Adams' voice added much to the film, having that rough, gritty sound that stuck in my head as part of the West.
That being out of the way, I was looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I saw the preview on Shrek.  I am a 23 year old visual artist, and I adore good animation that doesn't come just from Disney.  I loved the facial expressions used to convey emotion, and the fact that the sound editors used recordings from real horses, instead of using human voices, other than Matt Damon's voice, of course, but Spirit couldn't really talk.
There were a couple parts in the movie where I got a little twitchy...  such as the part where Spirit is cruelly mistreated by the American army trying to settle the West.  If you're a parent, I would definitely talk to your young child about the parts involving the cruelty.
About the soundtrack...  I definitely think it fits the movie.  The beautiful score has some ethereal strands to it, especially during the instrumentals...  and you all know my feelings on how Bryan Adams' voice ties in with the movie.  I will actually be purchasing it as soon as the soundtrack gets in my area.
This is a movie I would most certainly see repeatedly.  The animation is incredible, the story is beautiful, and the music is unforgettable.  I highly recommend it to anyone, of any age.  Hope this review helped.",1024185600,,1498,4.590225563909774

This is NOT just another kiddie animation flick. In fact, there was a little girl in the seat next to me who was probably 3 years old, and throughout the entire movie, all she did was ask her grandmother tons and TONS of questions. I doubt that she truely understood even a fourth of the movie. I also heard some kids crying throughout it, like they wanted to go home. But my friends and I LOVED it!

I am sick to DEATH of all these talking Disney dogs, cats, snakes, monkies, and all the other various talking animals. That becomes VERY old! This film was more natural, using natural horse sounds and body language. It was NOT boring! There was always some action to draw you in. The animation, as I said before, was GORGEOUS! Breathtaking! A masterpiece. In the opening scene, I was fighting back tears as they played the main theme and showed the horses running wild and free exactly as all horse should be! Oooooh it was beautious. Oh, yes, and the music is great. The lyrics are beautiful and have alot of symbolism and meaning. The instrumental is brilliant and emotional as well. Well now, I think i have typed enough, though there is no way to truely express how enchanting, wonderous, not to mention beautious Spirit is! GO SEE IT! I'm sure you will be pleased, as I was. I have only seen it once, and I deffinately plan on seeing it again, and owning it when it comes out on video and DVD. Just keep in mind that this isn't really such a kid's movie, so i would reccomend it only for children over 8 or 9 years of age.

No, he won't be tamed - and his courage has taken him to rescue Little Creek a fellow Lakota brave who has also fallen prey. Spirit falls in love with a filly mare the brave owns.
The animated feature is essentially an adventure of the old West - an uplifting celebration on one's freedom and independence. It aims to be earnest - so slapsticks and barrels of jokes are casted away, where instead Matt Damon voices Spirit's thoughts sparsely and the story unfolds through eight ballads penned by Bryan Adams which unfortunately maroons the movie into oversentimentality.
Yet the ride is a pleasure indeed - with rich production and fascinating visuals that remains reassuring old-fashioned. It is an ingenious mix of 2D and 3D drawings to enhance the sweeping landscapes and the vivid portrayal of the horses. Children will indulge in the comical expressions of the horses; while adults will be enthralled by the train wreck sequence where the locomotive rolls down the hill and combust into flames.
Spirit stays rooted to its political correctness. The white man who aims to conquer Spirit is none other than the cavalry colonel (James Cromwell). His virulence also endangers the livelihood of the Native Indians and the other horses. Spirit comes out heroic and noble in this spirited odyssey that promises top-notch entertainment, yet maybe Spirit may be a little too perfect in its characterization. Nonetheless it is a heart-thumping ride that is majestic in its drama caliber.",1023408000,,1618,5.041044776119403
1778881,5,B00006IUH2,"The new movie from Dreamworks (who's animation department keeps pushing the boundries with each movie) is a wonderfully crafted film. Instead of the standard ""kids"" method of having talking animals and cute musical numbers, this movie has the horses NOT talk and let's the story come out of it's actions. Pure Animation alone is the milestone of this film (not to mention the fact that horses are the hardest animals to draw, let alone animate).
The violence is mild compared to other Dreamworks films, but might still be enough to scare some children (don't judge a movie simply because of the G rating). This movie is not for little tykes!
A wonderfull film by the makers of Shrek, Eldorado, and Antz.",1023148800,,703,4.818181818181818
1778882,5,B00006IUH2,"My family and I went to see this movie this last weekend, much to my children's horror, but after seeing this movie I think that they understood what it means to be free. I am not really into cartoon movies but this movie thru animation gave the horse the honor that it deserved,especially the wild mustang. I was really moved by this movie from his birth to the realization that he alone was responsible for welfare of his band of and of the devotion of his mother. To his capture by the soldiers and the determination not to be broken by anyone. To his love for the Lacota Indian Boy and to beautiful Paint Mare Rain. The music was very good and if you really listen a message is there. It's too bad that movies like this will be lost or not really appritiated because to me Cimarron was really a hero. So if you want to see a good family movie see this one.",1023148800,,860,4.218181818181818
1778883,5,B00006IUH2,"We saw this movie as a family and we were all totally blown away.  There was more said with facial expressions and body movements than with words, and the messages came through loud and clear.  I think they could have toned down the portrayal of the soldiers though as they were portrayed as heartless bruts.  I would recommend this movie to everyone, and I have.  Don't miss it.",1022803200,,379,4.529411764705882
1778884,1,B00006IUH2,"I brought my 3 year old grandson to see ""Spirit"" for his first movie theater experience.  He loves animals and I picked this film based upon its G-rating.  G-rated films, by definition , are to have minimal violence.  While the film was beautifully produced, the violence was extreme.  The stallion was brutalized at every turn.  The attack on the Indian village was reminiscent of a Sam Peckinpah film.  We had to leave before the end of the film and we were not the only filmgoers to leave early during the showing we attended.
My problem is not with the film but with the rating.  If this were not an animated film it easily would have been rated a PG.  Should this make any difference?  Shame on those whose job it is to rate these films.",1022803200,,742,4.437037037037037
1778885,5,B00006IUH2,"When I first entered the theater, I thought I was in the wrong show.  There were only about 10 people inside, and the trailers have already been playing for close to half an hour.  Then I checked to make sure there were children.  There were, ok, so I sat myself down.
The nice thing about this film was that the creators didn't find the need to have speaking horses.  In fact, with the exception of Spirit's heart, only men do the talking.  The story is a recounting of Spirit's first adventure in the Old West and his first encounter with humans.  His adventure to discover what a campfire was led him away from his pack.  Spirit tells of the hardships he had to endure and the friends and enemies he made along the way in his quest to be reunited with his group (the Cimarron).
I must say, it wasn't bad.  There were several touching moments that put me on the verge of tears.  I'm not sure what the target audience age range should be.  I saw 3-8 year olds who had no idea what was going on, and didn't seem to enjoy the film much.  I guess they were expecting talking horses.  The only adults there were the parents of the children.  I saw no teenagers in the theater.  It's a shame.  This film was enjoyable and it does deal with certain issues like family values, friendship, loyalty and bravery.
If you're up for a heart-warming animated story, the kind Disney ""used"" to make (forgive my sarcasm, I don't know what possessed them to create Lilo and Stitch, the upcoming Disney feature), then by all means watch this film.
LEAP rating (each out of 5):
============================
L (Language) - 2 (there really isn't much talking going on)
E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a - I should hope not)
A (Action) - 3 (a stubborn horse can get into some pretty good action)

Dreamwork's ""Spirit:  Stallion of the Cimarron"" is a wonderful movie, and better than Disney's most recent films.  Production values are great, and the masterstroke was NOT giving the horses human voices, but rather letting them communicate in their own natural way.  BRAVO!",1022716800,,362,4.966666666666667

Ice Age was cute, Monsters Inc. was predictable, Spirit is stirring for the soul.  The score, the animation, the story line, the expressive communication of the characters makes you wonder why Disney has not been able to do this since Lion King.

1778890,5,B00006IUH2,"When it comes to ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"", what can I say except breath-taking, Awesome, Great, Flawless, and Brilliant? Well the best part was that I was with some wonderful friends when I saw it.  It was an exceptional film. I was especially impressed by Rain. She was very sassy and clever. The interaction between her and Spirit were both comical and sweet. It was a very humorous movie. In the opening sequence, Spirit had an especially funny interaction with a big herd of bison. The interactions between the horses themselves was ingenious. The emotions being conveyed by facial expressions, whinnies, and neighs as opposed to human speech. It added a level of realism where as Human speech would have made it quite cheesy. The animation was very fluid and nearly flawless in my opinion. I can honestly say that I could watch this movie fifty times and still never tire of it. The songs and musical score were top notch and added to the overall panoramic experience. It made me feel like I was there. This movie conveys several positive messages.  It implies the value of friendship and the necessity of respecting nature and its living things.  It also clearly states what I have always believed, which is that animals have feelings and emotions similar to humans.  This movie is a priceless treasure that is very family friendly. It spans the spectrum of emotion from joy to sorrow and back again. It is a wonderful adventure that will leave you cheering and crying at the same time. If you see any movie this year, make it ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"". You won't be disappointed, but you will be uplifted. If I could describe this movie in one word, I'd say perfection!!!",1022371200,,1697,4.761904761904762

1778894,5,B00006IUH2,"This movie was the best animated family movie I have ever seen! You will leave the theater uplifted and in love with the wild mustang - ""Spirit who could not be broken"". The music in the film is excellent and really fits in well with telling the story. The horses' expressions are done superbly, and they help you understand their emotions and thoughts, without the need for them to actually talk in human language. There's not a moment in the movie where you feel bored. There's plenty of action, and the scenery is gorgeous! You want to just step into the picture and be there too. There are several underlining themes of the movie including trust has to be earned not demanded, the importance of survival and not ever giving up, and the main theme of not forgetting who you are and the need to be yourself to flourish. You really admire the wild mustang's determination and stubborn will. He is a born leader, and a proven hero time and time again in the movie.  I found myself really sympathetic for Spirit and his quest to return home to his herd of horses. He knew where his heart was, and he stayed determined that it was not going to be any other way, despite us two legged creatures' wishes! It teaches you to respect and appreciate the horses' natural wild nature. There is no bad language in the movie to shield your children from either. Spirit's courage can be understood by everyone. You will be touched by Spirit's love and tenderness for his new friend, Rain, a sassy paint horse. She teaches him to see things a different way. You will understand the connection between the wild horse and Little Creek, the Indian. They are linked by fate with the common instinct to survive and be free. At the end of the movie, you will be left happy with a sense of justice and that feeling that everything is the way it should be for a wild horse who loved his home and family.  A truly unique and well thought movie.  You won't regret seeing it.  I recommend it to all!",1021939200,,1974,4.45983379501385
1778895,5,B00006IUH2,"I went to see this film in sneak preview with my 8 year old cousin.
I thought that it was incredible!  It's the story of a wild stallion who's captured, first by US soldiers, and then by a young Native American... All through out though, Spirit's heart is with his herd, running the hills of the untamed west!
Since the horses didn't speak in the film, except for narration by Matt Damon as the voice of Spirit, the horses facial expressions became central, so they had some really fun to watch ""conversations"".  This movie had one of the most touching mother/son relationships since Bambi, in my book, even without a word spoken between them!
It's a movie about being you are, and about never accepting defeat, and about soaring on wings of eagles... We can all stand to have a little of that untamed majesty beating in our hearts every now and then, so go see it, and let your self be taken away!

1778896,5,B00006IUH2,"After watching this movie, I have got to say that this is truly a unique theatrical experience. This is one of the many movies I have been wanting to see for a very long time, and I wasn't dissapointed. The presentation of Spirit is something to hold on to. The Brilliant Score of Hans Zimmer, the Exceptional Songs of Bryan Adams and the Superb Narration from Matt Damon is very Dazzaling. I can't say nothing bad about this movie because there really isn't anything to say.
For a 15 year old guy, like me, I was very Satisfied to see that Dreamworks also thought of the Adults, with the story being strong, as it is, but also giving us the normal humor that we expect from a kids film.
From the Opening Scene to the Final Jump, Spirit is a film that Everyone should go out and see, because it will bring people closer together. For sure Spirit will be getting an Award for the Excellent work that each individual did on this movie. I can't wait to get this on DVD!",1021766400,,966,4.313186813186813
1778897,4,B00006IUH2,"Set in the western frontier when the buffaloes still roamed the great plains, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron follows the exploits of a wild mustang.  A leader by birth, the movie tells the tale of his first encounter with humans, a journey that will change his life forever.
Narrated by Matt Damon as the voice of the mustang, one thing you'll notice immediately is the lack of dialogues, there weren't a lot of speaking parts in this film, and I applaud Dreamworks for taking such an unique approach.  Due to this fact, the animators took great pains to humanize the horses, giving them emotions and personalities such as curiosity, pride and humor.  For this reason alone, it might be hard for smaller children to sit through the entire movie, especially ones that have a short attention span.
As always the animation is top notch, something we have all come to expect of Dreamworks.  The portrayal of the beasts were very realistic, it was exhilirating to see them in action, galloping through the fields and leaping over cliffs, they were simply breath taking.  Another thing worth noting is the fantastic soundtrack, with a score by Hans Zimmer and vocal music performed by Bryan Adams, I thought they were very appropriate and easy to listen to with some great lyrics.
I admit to having misgivings on seeing a film about horses, and even though I found Spirit to have a mediocre story and a predicatble plot, I was nevertheless pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the experience.  It lacks the humor of Shrek, and the charm of Chicken Run, but Spirit is a worthy addition in the Dreamwork's growing list of animated pictures.  Be sure to take your family to see it this Memorial Day weekend.",1021161600,,1706,4.762711864406779
