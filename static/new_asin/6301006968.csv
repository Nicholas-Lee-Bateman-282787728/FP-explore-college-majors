7809711,4,6301006968,"I believe ABC network had the best Olympic coverage. In 1988, the network gave plenty of coverage in the days before DVR. The network covered the events like figure skating. They showed most or all skaters at the time.

I was thrilled to relive the memories of 1988 winter games in Calgary, Alberta, Canada which I believe was the best winter venue ever for the Winter Olympics.

Unfortunately, they only give the audience a hint of the game's theme song, ""Can You Feel It?"" In the beginning. I would love to have the complete single. The 1988 winter games had memorable moments like the Jamaican bobsledding team that inspired the film, ""Cool Running."" They were the true spirit of the games where it's not about winning a medal. There was Eddy Edwards who came in last and didn't seem to mind it. There was Alberto Tomba from Italy in skiing. There was Bonnie Blair and Dan Jansen who both represented the USA in speed skating.

The figure skating competition in 1988 was intense. In the men's competition, it was the Battle of Canadian Brian Orser against America's Brian Boitano. In the pairs, the tape shows the Soviet's Goordeeva and Grinkov and America's Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard. I wished they showed Valova and Valinkov too. Unfortunately, the Soviets dominated the pairs and ice dancing competition with four medals among the two categories.

1988 Ice Dancing competition had the Soviet's Bestiamanova and Bukin where you know why they won the event. They won the silver in 1984 and finally the gold here. The music, costumes, and their movement including ballet training displayed a level of difficulty. I wished the tape also showed the Canadian Tracy Wilson and Rob McCall too in their program. They won the bronze medal in this event. Sadly McCall died of AIDS a few years later.  To this day, ice dancing has changed and not for the better. Soviet Union collapsed where their skaters were once supported and trained. The Russians are still fiercely competitive in skating though. I do miss their dominance in ice dancing where they raised the bar higher for everybody else.

The tape shows the American ice dancers Suzy Semanick and Scott Gregory perform their program but they didn't medal though. Still Olympics isn't always about winning a medal. They performed and made the top ten couples in this event.

The ladies event had the battle of the Carmens with East German Katarina Witt against America's Debi Thomas. The surprise was Canada's Elizabeth Manley and Japan's Midori Ito.

I wished the tape would have included the figure skaters exposition event where the skaters let loose and skate for fun to the audience. I felt the tape about two hours long did a sufficient job in covering the games.

I remember the Seybolds, a brother and sister American team, skating in pairs. They didn't medal in the event but that didn't matter. The network did a piece on how their hometown helped raise money for them to go to the Olympics. In the end, I saw footage and that's what the Olympic spirit is all about.

If you want to relive those moments of the 1988 Calgary games, this tape is for you and is hosted by the late great sports broadcaster Jim McKay.",1428796800,,3179,4.763636363636364
