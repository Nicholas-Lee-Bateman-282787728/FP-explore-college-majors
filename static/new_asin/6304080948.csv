7861632,5,6304080948,"Well, since everyone else seems to be giving one of my favorite movies really negative reviews, I guess I'd had better set the record straight.  Someone said it was formulaic and I say so what.  Most movies are formulaic.  There is a problem, people are in danger and a solution is reached.  Duh!  This is very basic whether it be Jaws, snakes, locusts, serial killers -- whatever.  Someone else says the snakes don't like dynamiting.  Hey do you want someone dynamiting outside your house?  The den is disturbed and the snakes come out -- royally pissed off.  A man at the construction site dies (even though another reviewer says not -- but what does an idiot know).  There is a wonderful section where the daughter is sorting laundry and a very large rattler has gotten into the house and hidden in the dirty clothes.  Of course she is chased into a corner by the rattler.  I found this very creepy because I was raised in an area full of rattlers and had several close calls as a kid and I knew a girl who was bitten by one while on a swing.  The very idea of a venomous snake lose in my house gives me the shivers.  I'd be having absolute fits.  And yes, the stepfather is bitten I don't know how many times and ends up in the hospital.  This is a wonderful, fun, scary movie (especially if you don't like snakes which I don't.  This is why I watched snake movies -- to be scared by the snakes.  Vampires don't bother me, werewolves or mummies either.  But snakes are real and some of them are deadly.  I find this a lot scarier than pure fantasy.",1375833600,,1552,4.341463414634147
7861633,3,6304080948,"Rattlesnakes,disturbed by a construction project in the community of Eden Valley,awaken from their slumbers hungry and angry .They set out in search of food-human ,animal or avian ,it matters not .The opposition to the slithering hordes is lead by Paul Donahue (William Katt)the man behind the project .Snakes are not his only worry however-he is married to the local Doctor and his new stepson is finding it hard to adjust to his new dad ,constantly comparing him unfavourably to his ""real ""father .Plus ,he is phobic about snakes and can only triumph and save his family if he is able to overcome this situation

There is not an ounce of originality in the movie which slavishly adheres to the creature feature template  from characterisation to situation .The central conceit -serpents in a community bearing the name of Eden-is as unsubtle as you can get ;despites these handicaps it manages to be watchable with some decent performances helping ,especially Ian Abercrombie as the local herpatologist Dr Ramsey

An okay time killer",1143590400,,1035,5.076470588235294
7861634,1,6304080948,"When I first saw this movie I thought it would rock, man was I wrong.  It was a stupid movie about normal rattle snakes that never even killed a single person.  And it was not thrilling at all.  If you want to watch a movie about rattle snakes see Sighlent Preditors it may be a PG-13 horror, but it is one of the few good ones.  The rattle snakes are much better developped and they kill many people plus it's verry scarry expicially if you live in a nice quiet neighboor hood like me.",1140566400,3,486,4.138297872340425
7861635,2,6304080948,"William Katt and Shanna Reed star in this silly little thriller about a town being terrorized... by rattlesnakes!
Apparently the rattlesnakes are disturbed by the dynamiting at a nearby hillside. The final confrontation will leave some viewers gasping, not for the ophiophobic!!!Average acting, nothing much of a story.",1033344000,2,319,5.666666666666667
