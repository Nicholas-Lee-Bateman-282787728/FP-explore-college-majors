1523101,5,B00005JN8S,"I have been a fan of MSW since it first aired on CBS back in the '80s. I enjoyed viewing Season One again, as the first season episodes are rarely shown on the cable channels. Season One offers an introduction to Jessica Fletcher (as played by the wonderful actress, Angela Lansbury), and her hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine.

Not one to remain idle, Jessica constantly visits relatives located in various locations throughout the country or attends book signings in other locales. The guest appearances of actors from both film and television make the show quite nostalgic. I love Jessica's wardrobe, and how stylish and classy her character always appears.

I have purchased Seasons 1-5, and intend on purchasing the remaining sets. Murder, She Wrote is a delightful series. One in which I look forward to revisiting.",1486166400,3,817,5.0

1523108,4,B00005JN8S,"Jessica Fletcher was just a mild-mannered former schoolteacher, living in the quaint Maine town of Cabot Cove... until she wrote a bestselling murder mystery.

The initial premise of ""Murder, She Wrote: Season 1"" sounds like a how-they-became-famous paragraph at the beginning of an interview, but it's actually only the beginning of the story. But Jessica Fletcher's entry into the world of literary murder also was her introduction to REAL murder -- and with every episode, Angela Lansbury's endearingly intelligent, literate heroine winds her way through a twisty mass of motives, secrets and flashy 1980s fashion choices.

After the death of her beloved husband, Jessica Fletcher (Lansbury) decides to write a murder mystery just to occupy her time -- and is shocked when she learns that her nephew Grady (Michael Horton) has submitted it to a New York publisher. Soon Jessica's book is topping the charts, and she's been swept off in a whirlwood of publicity, interviews... and after a costume party, the murder of a guy dressed like Sherlock Holmes. When her nephew is implicated, she has no choice but to unravel a real-life murder mystery.

And as she continues traveling around, she keeps finding corpses everywhere -- a millionaire leaves his money to his dog; a theme park creator is shot; the producer of a tacky adaptation of her novel is bumped off; a drag club owner is killed; two Soviet ballet dancers are implicated in a man's murder; a killer strikes on a cruise; a popular jazz musician is poisoned; a famous artist is killed on a remote island; a passenger is found stabbed on a bus during a storm; ugly secrets come to light after a hanging in Wyoming, and many other strange crimes. Even her hometown of Cabot Cove isn't safe, as a wealthy man fakes his death and turns up dead for real, and a driverless car threatens to run away with her.

Everybody has at least one fictional character who is an integral part of their childhood, and who gives them that little warm nostalgic glow. For me, that's Jessica Fletcher. And all the credit for that can go to Angela Lansbury, who gives us the aunt/grandmother/mom that every person has ever wanted -- she's strong-willed, fiercely intelligent and does what's right, but she's also sympathetic and kindly to those around her (including some of the murderers).

And the story itself reflects that character. ""Murder She Wrote"" has a warm, amiable glow that is rooted in Jessica's everywoman sensibilities and simple life in Cabot Cove, a charming little town that is saved from excessive quaintness by having plenty of murder-related conflict and some endearing supporting characters. Examples: Claude Akins as a prickly fisherman friend of Jessica's, and Tom Bosley as the competent-but-not-up-to-murder sheriff.

But she works equally well in the many other places she goes -- New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, a Mediterranean island, Virginia's horse country -- and consorts with a colorful variety of people (reporters, politicians, fishermen, millionaires, artists, KGB agents, etc), and and never seems ill-fitted. The only real problem is perhaps that this season was still finding its specific niche in the murder-mystery market, and the supporting cast and Cabot Cove presence aren't as well-rounded as they would later be.

The mysteries are all pretty well-written -- a colorful or intriguing setting, plenty of interesting suspects, a number of clues (some of them red herrings), and plenty of snappy dialogue (""Don't you go to the movies?"" ""When Cary Grant bowed out, so did I""). Usually there's a slip of the tongue that betrays the killer somewhere in the story, along with some vital clue, and plenty of love affairs, greedy relatives, well-earned grudges woven into the mix. In short, they're solid whodunnits, and it often isn't clear to the audience who the guilty party is until Jessica lays it out, Christie-style.

The first season of ""Murder She Wrote"" is a thoroughly solid introduction to Jessica Fletcher and her mystery-writing/solving ways -- entertaining murder mysteries with plenty of color and memorable characters.",1477180800,,4119,5.119047619047619

1523652,5,B00005JN8S,"This is a series that has stood the test of time. Unlike many of the other older TV shows that DO seem dated watching them now, Murder She Wrote is still entertaining, witty...and with a stellar guest star list in most episodes that is rather amazing too. This show must have had a big budget to be able to have so many big name stars in the show, week after week.

Angela Lansbury is SO good in this role. And now, watching these shows again as an older adult, I realize just what a role model she was in this series too. She's an active, savvy, attractive older woman who not only cracks the case week after week; she also epitomizes how to age well and in so many ways.

This was a unique, special series and one of better shows to EVER be featured on TV. The regular cast and crew for Murder, She Wrote did a great job!

Sound and picture quality are good and the price is certainly a bargain, here at Amazon. If you enjoyed this show years ago, it's definitely worth another look now. ;-)

1523863,4,B00005JN8S,"This 1984-85 Season is what started this mystery series about a widowed retired English teacher, now novelist & amateur detective in a fictional town called Cabot Cove, Jessica Fletcher(Angela Lansbury)that ran on CBS from 1984-96 and was one of the most successful longest-running TV shows in history with 23 million viewers in its prime and was even a staple on CBS's Sunday night line-up right after 60 MINUTES for a decade.

Despite law enforcement officers objecting to Jessica's meddling in their crime scenes, she would often continue doing her own little deductions and would often end up knowing more about the criminal investigations than the cops did, which made Jessica a lot like Quincy(Jack Klugman)in a way, since Quincy would often end up solving murder investigations before the cops did, despite Quincy's annoyance.

1524050,5,B00005JN8S,"I actually never watched this show when it was originally on TV.  It debuted in 1984 and it lasted for 12 years! But after recently watching a few episodes for the very first time, I can see why this series was so successfull  The story lines are very catchy, you never know who the killer is (and it's hard to figure it out with the many twists and turns along the way) and it's not until the very end that the killer is revealed. It reminds me a lot of the Agatha Christie thrillers.

Angela Landsbury does a wonderful job in portraying the famous mystery writer/sleuth named J.B. Fletcher who helps the local police figure out who the killer is. She lives in the fictional coastal town of Cabot Cove in Maine.  Some of the episodes take place in Cabot Cove, but many others take place in many different locations since Jessica Fletcher travels the world to promote her latest book.  Her characher is very astute but at the same time, she comes across as a very warm and caring person. I think Angela Landsbury was made to play this character, and I can't imagine anyone else doing as good of a job as she does. What I also like about this series is that even though it's a thriller, it doesn't show a lot of violence or blood as many of the newer shows do on TV these days. I love this series and I could go on and keep watching one episode after another (if I had the time). Great series!",1413763200,2,1392,4.277566539923955

1524270,5,B00005JN8S,"I love this mystery series mainly because it stars the incomparable Angela Lansbury.  This first set begins with the pilot film in which J.B. Fletcher is loath to become a published author and ends with her sticking her nose into everyone's business as somewhat of an expert at solving crimes.  Even knowing ""whodunit"" doesn't keep this series from being entertaining, something to watch repeatedly.  It is chockfull of aging movie stars on their way out and young actors supposedly on their way up (although most of them never quite made it into the big time).

I too had some difficulty playing these double sided disks.  For some reason my Blu-ray player couldn't handle them but my backup cheapo DVD player could.  (It's an inconvenience though, switching machines in the middle of an episode, finding where you were with the help of the scene search-&-find feature in the menu.)

I was surprised to learn they initially thought to cast Jean Stapleton then Doris Day in the role made famous by Angela Lansbury (I still think it's criminal that they couldn't have coughed up one measly Emmy for the great work she did on this series!).  It's also criminal that CBS purposely killed off the series in 1996.  Don't even get me started on that!",1402876800,,1244,4.802816901408451

1524384,5,B00005JN8S,"Long ago I owned all of these sets which I finally sold, but this one was such a great price I wondered how it differed from the 'complete series one' which is more expensive. The first three seasons arrived today. From what I can see, the difference is that each of these sets are contained in a small (about 1/2 inch  thick) plastic white DVD box, much thinner than the series I first owned and all of the discs are on plastic 'pages' inside it. It seems to have the same episodes, 21 or 22 a season. I like these better since they take up way less space. When you are a mystery collector, this is an important factor. These are pleasant mysteries with character actors from the past who add a great deal of nostalgia for those of us who were around when they first aired on television. Getting the first three seasons for $35. was a great buy.",1397174400,14,846,4.2875
1524385,5,B00005JN8S,Angela Lansbury is one of my favorites.  She is especially good as Jessica Fletcher in this series.  The mysteries are good and the solutions are entertaining.  Much better than the new kinds of gory garbage being shown on regular TV now.,1396828800,4,238,4.7560975609756095

I'm 32 years old which puts me in an age group not typically associated with television of this genre but it's WONDERFUL! It's intelligent there is no embarrassment if my child watches with me or happens to be in the room. Highly recommend to anyone and will be buying the entire series after the holidays.

1525001,5,B00005JN8S,Murder She Wrote was one of my all-time favorite TV shows and these CD's take me back to that time.  I will never want for entertainment as long as I have these in stock.  I'm working on having all of them (as money allows).,1358208000,,224,4.068181818181818
1525002,5,B00005JN8S,This is one of my absolute favorite shows of all time. One reason being that Angela Lansbury is my favorite actress of all time. The show is just great about an amazing detective and how she solves the murder mysteries. The show was amazing most seasons but unfortunately the last 2 seasons weren't as great. Most likely because they ran out of good ideas/material to make good story lines. Overall the show is 9 out of 10,1358121600,,422,4.4935064935064934
1525003,4,B00005JN8S,"If you never watched this when it was new, watch it now. The mysteries remain as absorbing as the were then, you just can't miss. When you buy this first season, you'll want the next, and the next etc.
If you like mysteries you'll love this, and with each season it gets better.
Angela Lansbury can do it all - comedy, drama etc. and she does it well here.",1357948800,,356,4.173913043478261
1525004,5,B00005JN8S,"I don't know what it is, but I have always felt drawn to Angela Lansbury as an Actress.  From her acting in ""Mrs. 'Arris Goes to Paris"", ""Gaslight"" ( her first screen role with Ingrid Bergman & Charles Boyer ),
to Disney's ""Beauty and The Beast"" or even ""The Harvey Girls""

Murder She Wrote:
It does have the occational cleavage/low necklines.  That aside, it is a wonderful series and Angela Lansbury is wonderful from begining to end.",1357689600,,436,4.636363636363637

How could anyone not love a show about a cute little granny solving mysteries? I really enjoyed being able to rewatch all the episodes I loved and they are just as good as I remembered. The only complaint I have is some of the episodes didn't look very good compared to others, I guess because the video quality used to make the DVD wasn't great for those. Still, very enjoyable and recommended!",1355529600,,518,4.19

1525115,5,B00005JN8S,"I used to watch this show ALL the time and was excited when I saw they were available on DVD.  They are just as much fun as I remembered!

If you enjoyed them when they originally aired, if you enjoyed them in reruns, or if you're just looking for a family friendly detective series, this is what you should watch!

Angela Lansbury does an EXCELLENT job portraying Jessica Fletcher.  The stories are believable and they are from a more family friendly time, so you don't have to worry about too much gore or scantily clad women.",1353974400,,528,4.46875
1525116,5,B00005JN8S,"In one way Murder She Wrote is your typical whodunnit with the main investigator being a female mystery writer.  Just like Perry Mason certain crucial facts are withheld from the viewer until the last minute of each show.  Writers call this technique ""deux ex machina"" and is not considered the best writing technique.  But who cares?  I don't like this show because of literary perfection - I watch it because of Angela Landsbury.  More often than not she is dragged unwillingly into a murder mystery, but once in it, she is like the tortise that hangs on until it thunders.  If you liked her in Bedknobs and Broomsticks, you will love her in Murder She Wrote. If anyone else were given the lead role, this show would have quickly passed into television history with no more than a footnote.",1344384000,2,792,4.661870503597123

1525118,5,B00005JN8S,"It all began September 30, 1984 on CBS. ""Murder, She Wrote"" became a highly popular mystery tv series.

1525119,5,B00005JN8S,"I am not exactly this show's target demographic, being a 30 something guy, but Murder She Wrote is my favourite show. There's just something about it that draws me in. The dvds, though, are flipper discs....which is not a good thing. Especially from Universal. Luckily, I could watch every episode in the set without any problems. Though, I don't know how much I'll watch the first season, or 2nd or 3rd seasons, because of the flipper discs. You have to be a lot more careful with them. If you're a fan of mystery stories and shows, like Sherlock Holmes, you'll love Murder She Wrote.",1341014400,,585,4.634615384615385
1525120,5,B00005JN8S,"Angela Lansbury and a great supporting cast have made Murder, She Wrote a classic series that has withstood the test of time. Lansbury plays former high school English teacher Jessica Fletcher who takes up writing as a hobby after retirement. Her debut mystery novel ""The Corpse Danced at Midnight"" makes the bestseller list and in the pilot episode ""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes"" Jessica travels to NYC where she is greeted by her nephew Grady and his girlfriend who happens to work for Jessica's publisher. This pilot episode is pivotal in setting the stage to portray Jessica as a consummate sleuth and there's even a possible romance angle!

The charm of Murder, She Wrote lies in Angela Lansbury's amazing and very credible portrayal as a talented author and an astute sleuth. Lansbury is supported by an amazing ensemble cast, and many of the guest stars in each episode are TV stars themselves. This makes this show a wonderful walk down memory lane as the viewer is encouraged to identify each actor. The idyllic setting of the fictional Cabot Cove, Maine is the perfect backdrop, serving as J.B. Fletcher's home base, and the inhabitants are an interesting and eccentric bunch of characters. Though murders are committed with alarming frequency in this scenic setting, this is portrayed in a credible manner (reminds one of the contemporary British cozy crime drama, Midsomer Murders).

Each episode is a treat, and the sleuthing Jessica is amazing to watch as she unravels one mystery after another. I first watched Murder She Wrote when I was a teenager, and still love the series after all these years which attests to the show's staying power. I hope to collect the entire set in the near future.",1337558400,,1710,4.934027777777778
1525251,4,B00005JN8S,"I remember this show growing up. It was a solid tv show. Solid stories and acting. I watch it now and think . . . geez . . . it was pretty violent. Showing screw drivers and knives sticking out of people. Blood dripping off of people. And of course the plots revolve around people killing other people. (Just like the 70s had all the police shows [and the 80s continued that of course] the 80s had the murder plot shows--Matlock, In the Heat of the Night, Murder She Wrote, etc No wonder American society is so violent.) It was no wonder that after a season or two it lost its shine and appeal. It became stale after a while and back then I just stopped watching it. But I will say that back then as a kid I had the impression of Angela Lansbury's character as kinda stiff and schoolmarmish. She was. But watching season one I didn't know how goofy the character was too, and how much sexual innuendo there was as well. Anyway it was  and still is a good show. I am enjoying watching the DVD.",1334793600,,992,4.221052631578948
1525252,5,B00005JN8S,"I like the video  Murder she wrote because I use it to improve my spoken English and my listening to.  So I enjoy myself and I learn very soon a lot of new words.  The scripts are interesting , the actors are clever and I am never bored.",1334102400,2,237,3.8958333333333335
1525253,5,B00005JN8S,WE LOVED WATCHING THIS SEASON OF MURDER SHE WROTE AND LOOK FORWARD TO ORDERING MANY MORE SEASONS.  SHE WAS GREAT IN THIS SERIES.,1331251200,,128,4.565217391304348
1525254,4,B00005JN8S,"It is hard to believe that Angela Lansbury was not the first choice to play Jessica Fletcher in ""Murder, She Wrote."" CBS offered the role to Jean Stapleton, who declined. With all due respect to the talented Stapleton, only Angela Lansbury (""Gaslight,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate"", ""Bedknobs And Broomsticks"" and Broadway's ""Mame"", ""Gypsy"", ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Blithe Spirit"") could have made Jessica such a vital and interesting character. With Lansbury as star, ""MSW""  became  an enormously popular success; running 12 years (1984-1996) and earning Lansbury 12 Emmy nominations. Amazingly, and inexcusably, she never won.
  The series begins with a well-crafted 93 minute movie titled ""The Murder Of Sherlock Holmes."" Jessica's adorable nephew Grady (Michael Horton) sends her murder-mystery manuscript to a publisher. It is published, becomes an instant best-seller, and Jessica becomes a overnight celebrity (Surprise!). A guest is murdered at a costume party, and catching the killer comes at great personal cost to Jessica.
  Jessica is an American variation on mystery novelist Agatha Christie and Christie's crime-solving heroine Miss Marple. She lives in the quiet, fictional town of Cabot Cove, Maine. But the series soon sends her off on a series of whirlwind adventures;  in such places as Hollywood, Broadway, Washington D.C. and a Mediterrian Island. And everywhere that Jessica goes, a murder occurs. ""MSW"" employs a gallery of guest stars every episode, who appear as murder suspects and murder victims. Many of the weekly guest stars had previously worked with Lansbury.
  Jessica is intelligent, observant, no-nonsense, fearless, and caring and compassionate when she needs to be-- with a strong sense of justice, of course. Her character is best described in the episode ""Tough Guys Don't Die."" When a judge marvels at her persistence and determination, Jessica modestly replies, ""It is not in my nature to leave things undone."" Although ""Murder"" is in the title, the series is, basically, a light-hearted  and fun  affair;  with a great deal of humor thrown in with the suspense. In the episode ""Hooray For Homicide"", Jessica searches for an important clue that went unnoticed by others. A police detective says, ""Tell me, Mrs. Fletcher, do you have any theories on Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance?"" She replies, ""There's no need to be sarcastic."" In the episode ""Tough Guys Don't Die,"" disgruntled detective Harry McGraw (""Law And Order's"" Jerry Orbach) is not at all happy to have Jessica working with him on a murder case. Harry flippantly suggests that Jessica return to Cabot Cove and her needlepoint. She says, ""I tried that and it put me to sleep. That's why I wrote my first book."" Harry growls back, ""I read your first book and it put me to sleep,"" Jessica instantly replies, ""Well, that's your privlege,"" as she storms out, refusing to be insulted any further.
  There are many memorable episodes. In  ""Lovers And Other Killers"", Jessica travels to Seattle to be a guest lecturer at a university. Her much younger male secretary David (Andrew Stevens) is accused of the murder of a wealthy older woman. The plot goes in some rather interesting directions, and we are never actually sure that David, while not a killer, is not a con-man and a seducer. And is he really attracted to Jessica? Never fear; Jessica doesn't fall for obvious tricks. The episode ""We're Off To Kill The Wizard"" features a wonderful performance by guest star  James Coco as the tyrannical owner of  a house of horrors.  In ""My Johnny Lies Over The Ocean"",  Jessica pretends to be falling-down drunk in order to catch a killer.
The fan-favorite episode ""Murder Takes The Bus"" features all the elements of a tight, classic whodunit. Jessica takes a bus ride to Portland, Maine with her friend, the easily  flustered Sheriff Amos Tupper (""Happy Days'"" Tom Bosley). A thunderstorm erupts, a passenger is murdered. Suspects on this deadly bus trip include Linda Blair (""The Exorcist""), Larry Linville (""M*A*S*H"") , Rue McClanahan (""The Golden Girls"") and Michael Constantine (""Room 222""). Most of all, though, it is the charismatic Angela Lansbury who makes  ""Murder, She Wrote"" so entertaining.",1329091200,3,4189,5.2038690476190474
1525255,5,B00005JN8S,Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He LOVES all the old tv shows so this was one more to add to his collection of shows.  He was overjoyed.,1326412800,,147,4.0344827586206895
1525256,5,B00005JN8S,"My wife and I love this show.  We're in our late 20s but started watching it because we wanted a new show after getting bored of ""The Office.""  It's fantastic.  I read some reviews about the quality of the disks.  The dvd skipped constantly on the dvd player downstairs, but it worked great on the one upstairs, and it worked great on our laptop.  So maybe the disks are a bit finicky, but I'm guessing it has more to do with the quality of the dvd player itself than the disks.",1325721600,2,478,4.208791208791209
1525257,5,B00005JN8S,"Back in May 1985, UK broadcaster ITV commenced a series which would go on to run for 12 series, Murder She Wrote. The structure was extremely straightforward. Each week, novelist Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) would become involved in a murder, either at home in Cabot Cove, Maine or on one of her many destinations that she would end up in. Basically if Jessica Fletcher is in town, you can be sure of a murder.
To this day the series has had countless reuns on both the BBC and ITV. During the 1980s and 1990s ITV had first run episodes and then repeated them all. In the 2000s BBC1 and BBC2 took turns in running them. Even to this day (December 2011), ITV are rerunning episodes in the afternoons. Not to mention the numerous satellite channels that have also screened it. This series could be played forever!
Just a tiny selection of the countless guest stars in this first boxset include - Ned Beatty (Homicide: Life on the Street), Tom Bosley (Happy Days), Dack Rambo (Dallas), Jared Martin (Dallas), Kerry Armstrong (Prisoner: Cell Block H), Jerry Orbach (Law and Order), Barbara Babcock (Dallas/Hill Street Blues/Dr Quinn Medicine Woman), John Beck (Dallas), Morgan Brittany (Dallas), Diane Muldaur (LA Law), Rue McClanahan (Golden Girls) and William Windom in a different role to the recurring role he would have from series 2 as Dr Seth Hazlett.

MURDER, SHE WROTE showcased the talents of Angela Lansbury as retired schoolteacher and acclaimed mystery novelist, Jessica ""J.B."" Fletcher.  Jessica's inspiration for her books comes in the various murders and intrigues that constantly come her way, even in her sleepy hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine.  Recurring characters in this and the early seasons include Sheriff Amos Tupper (Tom Bosley), local fisherman Ethan (Claude Akins); and Jessica's nephew Grady (Michael Horton).

MURDER, SHE WROTE ran for twelve seasons (plus several additional TV movies); and attracted a veritible galaxy of guest stars, drawn from the stage and screen.  There's no gratuitous sex or violence on display; bad language is kept to a minimum...yep, these were the days, alright!  Perfect entertainment for those lazy weekend afternoons.

Episodes:

""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes"" (movie-length pilot) - Jessica travels to New York to celebrate the success of her debut novel, but when an unwanted guest is murdered at a costume party, she wishes she'd stayed home!  Guest stars Brian Keith, Anne Francis, Ned Beatty and Herb Edelman.

There are around 12 or so episodes with a host of well-known people (Peter Graves, Forrest Tucker, John Saxon, Dean Jones, etc.) starring in different ones.

Each show flows freely and the murder of each episode usually happens at the beginning or very soon afterwards.  The rest of each episode consists of Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) searching for clues and questioning a host of suspects.  Of course, like Sherlock Holmes and other detectives, she nabs the criminal.

Each episode is around 45-50 minutes the time flies by as you enjoy each episode.

Watch and enjoy.

1525533,5,B00005JN8S,"My wife and I like to watch DVDs late at night before we go to bed. We prefer something that is somewhat bland but well done and pleasant to watch. Thus it is that we came upon ""Murder, She Wrote,"" a CBS TV program series that dates back to the mid 80s. It was a popular program intended for the family hour and ran for many years. I always mildly enjoyed it. We ordered Season 1 and Season 2. We're almost through with viewing Season 1.

""Murder, She Wrote"" is an enjoyable series. Angela Lansbury and the supporting cast do a fine job. The stories are lightweight, but fun to follow. We usually have figured out who the culprit is before the end of the program, but that's all right. Although the stories mostly involve murders, there is generally a minimum of violence, and we prefer it that way. A great deal of care has been takes in constructing these programs and it shows. The settings are marvelous and I love viewing old New England with the quaint housing and antique furniture. One of the stories took place at the University of Washington in Seattle, a university where I just happened to attend graduate school. They did a marvelous job with it.

We've enjoyed this series very much. It's not deep and thought-provoking. It's enjoyable and pleasant viewing and suites our needs well. We're looking forward to Season 2.

I might add, that this DVD package is the only one that I've ever seen where the DVD is recorded on both sides.  A lot of user reviews have complained about the quality of the DVD disc itself. It seems a bit unusual, but we've had no problems with it.

My credit card was already charged and I didn't even know the status of my order. I contacted the seller on three seperate occasions and never recieved a response. I couldn't file a claim because the system wouldnt permit me. I was furios and just when I had given up on the thought of my merch arriving it came USPS. They experience wouldnt have been so bad if the seller would have responded and let me know something and not leave me hanging.

Don't you just love Jessica, our own Miss Marple. In the shows she is a retired school teacher who is now into writing murder mysteries, but who is solving a real life murder in every show. The cops may be stalled (or stupid), but Jessica is always on the ball. She's no namby pamby little old lady either. That tongue of hers can be quite sharp too and no one can best her when it comes to a battle of wits. Another reason to watch the shows is seeing all the actors and actresses you have forgotten over the years. I'm watching one now with Chuck Conners in it (from season 2) and I'd forgotten all about him. Every show is like that. You are constantly wandering who is that person? Jessica's facial expressions are hilarious to watch. She is a great actress,  although this is the only role Angela Lansbury was in that I really liked all that much.

1525720,3,B00005JN8S,"I was in my teens when MSW first appeared on television and could not get interested in it even though I've always been a fan of shows like Columbo, Remington Steele and Simon and Simon. Maybe I had a problem with there being a murder everywhere Jessica Fletcher went. I remember the title for Mad magazine's satire at the time was Murder She Hopes.

Anyway, I recently bought season one of the show to see if it would grow on me. After watching the pilot movie and a few of the regular episodes, I found that the Jessica character is still annoying (at least Detective Columbo is sticking his nose into people's business because he's doing his job) and that the stories and supporting actors don't do enough to keep me interested. The Cabot Cove (I'm assuming a ficitious name) location shots are pretty though. This show is probably for fans only.

For Australian fans, take note that the Region 4 release contains episodes that are little more than 46 minutes each. You may prefer purchasing the Region 1 set from Amazon, as I believe the episodes are around 48 minutes each. Beware though, as I have noticed that a few MSW reviewers have had problems with their double-sided Universal discs. Also see my Adam 12 Season One review regarding double-sided discs and edited episodes.

Note added December 2008 - I've since found that some region 4 releases are shorter not because they have scenes deleted but because they play at a slightly faster speed (something to do with transfer to PAL format) - although you probably won't notice it in the voices or actions.",1196467200,3,1566,4.6872727272727275

1525842,2,B00005JN8S,"When you read this review, please keep in mind that this is a review of these DVDs which is only Season 1 of the show.

My daughter and I watch this show at midnight every Saturday night. It is our opportunity to bond as together we make fun of what is one the worst television shows I have ever watched. Yes, I know I am going to be stomped on by the many fans of this horror but I can't lie. I wasn't a big television watcher back in the 80's so if this is an example of great TV from then, I can only assume that TV was awful (or should I say offal).

There are no extras (commentary, specials, etc.) included other than the pilot. How did this show ever get past the pilot? The inane plot, the overacting of Bert Convy and Arthur Hill, the underacting of Brian Keith, the lame attempts at comedy, and the incredibly doltish ending. It also creates a conundrum for the script writers as J.B. Fletcher gets her start when her nephew (who has a recurring role in the series) secretly sends her first manuscript off to the publishers. Future episodes, however, make J.B. out to be a modern day Agatha Christie with a boatload of novels and new ones on the way all the time (although how she finds the time to write a novel with all the murders going on around her is beyond me). And speaking about all the murders, how could one person possibly know so many murder victims? It's frightening how often murders occur around this woman. If I found out that J.B. Fletcher was visiting my town, I would certainly head off on a vacation immediately!

It's hard to pick out the worst episode of the actual first season but probably the last one, ""Funeral at Fifty-Mile"" could qualify although ""Murder to a Jazz Beat"" could give it a run for its money. As to the least worst, ""Death Takes a Curtain Call"" with William Conrad playing a major in the Russian army wasn't bad. And there was actually one good episode in the season.  ""Footnote to Murder"" with Paul Sand was actually quite funny and the mystery itself wasn't bad. Sand does a great job playing the drunken poet Horace Lynchfield. But these are the exceptions. The typical episode features a confused plot performed by actors who once were famous (Cesar Romero, Jose Ferrer, Herschel Bernardi), who were never famous, or were on the D-List at the time. The best part of the episodes is the opening credits when you can play ""try to recognize the name"". The worst part is the usually incredibly stupid joke that is inserted at the end of most episodes. They are generally not funny but more the type of joke that makes you roll your eyes in disbelief.

OK, I am willing to admit that Angela Lansbury is probably the reason that this show was on for so long. She generally plays the character of J.B. Fletcher quite well in spite of the terrible scripts that she must endure. Lansbury is a fine actor and she deserved much better than the words she is forced to regurgitate but she does a good job nonetheless. In fact, Lansbury keeps this from being a one-star rating, as tempted as I am to give it only one star.

Anyway, in spite of all this, I can recommend this show as a guilty pleasure. It is so bad that it is good (well, sometimes).",1180483200,4,3191,4.3908629441624365

This series was one of them.

I was delighted on how well written the who-dunnits are, and how great JB Fletcher's character is. I like how they portray her as an older lady that just wouldn't resort to knitting after her husband died. She instead followed her passion, and though she was probably about 60 when she did it, she still made a career for herself out of her hobby.

Angela Lansbury does a great job at showing how Jessica Fletcher is on the ball and always looking to help those wrongly accused.

I think that the heroine is an inspiration to women. Many people think that once you get older 'it's all downhill'. I'm relatively young ( 23) but I grew up with older parents ( my dad passed away at 67 and my mom is now 65) and I have seen how both men and women take age as something that is dreaded. My husband is 26 and now is freaking out about being almost thirty! I mean, come on!

But we all do it. However, JB Fletcher was no house wife; she was an active runner, writer, and loved every minute of helping the citizens of Cabot Cove out.

A problem, but it's probably just dirty from shipping (although no DVD from anyone except Universal has this problem.)  Stop the player, take out the DVD, and carefully wash it with optical cloth.  Restart the player, fast forward to the skipping spot.  Failure: the DVD hangs fast forwarding.  Ditto using the scene selection menu.

Take the DVD out, clean it again, and try it in our second DVD player.  This time it hangs fast forwarding, hangs in menu selection, and hangs in the first 3 minutes after skipping several times in those 3 minutes.

Fine -- one of joys of buying from Amazon is that they are very good about replacing defective products.  Except that when I request a replacement DVD, Amazon says that due to the number of similar problems with ""Murder, She Wrote"", they will NOT replace the disks, but instead issue a refund.

I have over 3,000 DVDs, and only a few have been defective.  Now that I think about it, the defective ones have all been Universal double-sided DVDs.

1526027,5,B00005JN8S,"I can remember watching this show on television before it went off the air, and then I wondered where would I ever watch it again?  Then, I was lucky enough to find reruns of the show and started watching it all over again, and fell more in love with it then when it currently aired.  I find this DVD collection to be the best collection ever, because you hardly find reruns of the first episodes that really explained what the show was.  For instance, who knew about the pilot episode?  I sure didn't, but when I watched it on the DVD I was blown away by how different it was from the actual episodes that occurred during the run of the show.  Most pilots don't even keep some of the re-occurring characters, but I was pleasently surprised to see that the character of ""Brady"" stuck around in future shows.  Naturally they could have replaced that character or taken him out of the show completely, but I liked how he stayed around, and by the same actor.  This collection is definetly worth the price, and definetly worth re-watching.  Being a junior in college right now, I'm hooked all over again by the mysteries Jessica had to solve, and how she figured out the killer by the end of each episode.",1141344000,2,1202,4.45662100456621
1526028,5,B00005JN8S,"I remember when ""Murder, She Wrote"" first aired on CBS every Sunday night in the mid-80s. I never watched the show back then. It was probably because I was never into murder mysteries. But as the years passed by I started to watch murder mystery movies such as ""Murder on the Orient Express"", ""Death on the Nile"", and ""Jagged Edge"" and got immediately hooked. Then last year when I heard that the first season of ""Murder, She Wrote"" was coming out on DVD, I just couldn't resist. I had to buy it and watch the episodes. And boy am I sure glad I did!

""Murder, She Wrote"" is one of the most intriguing and entertaining dramatic shows that I've ever seen. It's occasionally fast-paced, funny, and very well made. Angela Lansbury probably had the role of her career as murder mystery novelist/sleuth Jessica Fletcher. Each episode revolved around her trying to slove the murder of a certain character that gets bumped off. It's fun to watch as these episodes play out, trying to guess who done it. And usually by the end of every episode when Ms. Fletcher reveals who's the guilty party, (at least to me) it turns out to be a major surprise. That's what makes this show all the more intriguing.

Another element that makes ""Murder, She Wrote"" a fun show to watch is to see the guest stars that turn up in each episode. Season one had plenty of familiar faces who showed up for a guest appearence. They included: Leslie Nielsen (""The Naked Gun""), Rue McClanahan (""The Golden Girls""), Jerry Orbach (""Law & Order""), Vicki Lawrence (""The Carol Burnett Show""), Peter Graves (""Airplane!""), Martin Landau (""Ed Wood""), Lynn Redgrave (""Georgy Girl""), Linda Blair (""The Exorcist""), Piper Laurie (""Carrie""), as well as comedy legend Milton Berle, football great Dick Butkus, and a very young Joaquin Phoenix (""Walk the Line""), who's billed under his former name Leaf Phoenix for the episode that he appears in.

Just about every episode in season one of ""Murder, She Wrote"" is good. My favorite episodes from season one include: ""It's a Dog's Life"", We're Off to Kill the Wizard"", ""Death Casts a Spell"", ""My Johnny Lies Over the Ocean"", ""Sudden Death"", ""Murder Takes the Bus"", and ""Armed Response"". Also good is the pilot movie ""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes"" that got ""Murder, She Wrote"" off and running for what would eventually be 12 long years.

But the biggest mystery about ""Murder, She Wrote"" is why didn't Angela Lansbury win an Emmy for her work as Jessica Fletcher? What in god's name were those Emmy voters thinking of back then? They nominated Lansbury for all 12 seasons of the show and didn't reward her with one Emmy. Not one. That's a crime that I don't think anyone could slove. On the bright side, Lansbury did win a couple of Golden Globe awards for the show, including a Golden Globe for season one.

""Murder, She Wrote"" is a great show and I'm glad that I'm getting a chance to catch up on these episodes.",1141171200,6,2912,4.690802348336595

I too have fond memories of it but after viewing about half of this collection I've decided to put it away. I remember enjoying Angela Lansbury very much but there always was something that seemed forced with her portrayals & after revisiting these shows I've come to the conclusion that I spend more time ""wanting to like her"" than actually involving myself in the plots. ""Mystery,"" for some reason has never been a forte of Hollywood. I've a feeling it isn't the creative abilities of the writers as much as the nervousness of producers worrying about catering to a greater than 13 year old mentality that keeps plots so predictable and much of the acting and dialog so brainless.

OK, I'll admit that I'm coming back to these shows after having been brainwashed by Inspector Morse and Midsommer Murders but hey, I'm sure the Murder She Wrote budget trumped both of these series.",1139702400,2,963,4.6647058823529415

1526275,5,B00005JN8S,"""Murder, She Wrote"" has always been one of my favorite televission mystery series. I truly love Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Jessica Fletcher, a widowed mystery novelist living in Cabit Cove, Maine. Jessica not only writes mysteries, she naturally solves them as well. Through her down-home common sense, she cleverly outwits clever killers who feel that they are undefeatable. Jessica Fletcher is a character of immense magnitude, and one who will always be remembered.

This DVD set is good despite some faulty sound quality in places. It contains three disks with six episodes on each. My favorite episode is the pilot, ""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes,"" which explains how Jessica became a writer, and finds her solving the murder of a man who she briefly met at a costume party. The man was, you guess it, dressed like Sherlock Holmes! Jessica uses ingenuity to reach a surprising conclussion, and along the way, becomes imbroilled in many hilarious escapades.

Not only is Jessica unforgettable, but the quirky characters in her hometown are also memorable.

This series is truly worth watching. Also recommended are the ""Columbo"" DVD collections. Enjoy!",1127347200,,1160,5.225806451612903

It sounds like one of my speaker wires is loose, but they're fine because everything else I play on my DVD sounds great. I compare this to Quantum Leap (also double-sided) and it's hard to believe they're both produced by Universal.

I find it ironic that the studios wage war against bootleggers, yet they take forever to release old shows, then force us to pay full price for poor quality releases like this. Seems like a better way to build our loyalty  would be to 1) release shows in a timely manner and 2) make sure that the authentic studio releases are of higher quality than a pirated one.

I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie and these plots owe a lot to the great detective fiction writer.

The plots are worthy of Christie and the performance of the incredibly talented Angela Lansbury is superb. The one thing I missed out on as a child is the amount of humour in the scripts. There are some wonderfully wry moments of comedy and it is laced with irony.

The DVD's, however, leave much to be desired. Considering how beloved this show was during its TV run, you would think Universal would have provided some extras. Instead, we get the annoying new double sided disc treatment (careful of fingerprints!) and nothing extra; an example of a cheaply done DVD release for a major series.

1526531,3,B00005JN8S,"I don't know what to make of Universal Studios? On the one hand Universal has done a pretty good job of making some of the older and classic television shows available to their fans. MSW is definitely a show that fans have been waiting for. I'm one of the more casual fans. As a teenager, when the show first aired, I enjoyed watching the first few seasons, after that I found that the shows were still good but the novelty had worn off. However, when I heard that the first season was making its way to DVD I knew I would have to purchase a copy. I don't remember having ever seen the pilot movie, ""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes"", and that was an unexpected treat. These early episodes are my favorites. I enjoyed the Cabot Cove crowd that made up these episodes. Claude Akins, Capt. Ethan Cragg, as Jessica's friend that will do anything to help her. Tom Bosley, Sheriff Amos Tupper, was my favorite Cabot Cove Sheriff, I greatly missed him when he departed the show. Also, each show was packed with multiple, and recognizable, guest stars. My favorite episode from season one is ""Murder takes the Bus."" A nifty ""who-dunnit"" that keeps the viewer guessing as to who the killer(s) is. This brings me to my complaint on the other hand of this issue.

During my viewing of ""Murder takes the Bus"" my DVD froze and then skipped an entire chapter. This is the fourth Universal DVD that I will have to take back for this problem. I have no real knowledge of what causes a disk to freeze or skip but I'm willing to bet that it has to do with the way Universal crams eight shows on each disk, four on each side. I'm sure that Universal is attempting to save money by limiting the amount of disks for each shows DVD release. Well they can't be saving money, the sheer amount of money they must be losing in returns and exchanges is probably eliminating any savings they think they are making by using 3 disks instead of 6 for a seasons release of shows. I've noticed that Anchor Bay, who released HUNTER and THREE'S COMPANY only use one side of their disks and I have never had to return any of their DVD's. Using one side of a disk makes them a lot easier to handle and I'm guessing that having less material crammed on the disk helps reduce the skipping and freezing.

I would have given this DVD set a 4 star rating. I deducted a star for the cheap Universal DVD packaging and lack of extra features. I would still suggest that fans buy this set but make sure you watch all the episodes as soon as you can so that you can return or exchange the set if you encounter viewing problems.",1112832000,97,2578,4.357588357588358

1526533,5,B00005JN8S,"The real mystery at the heart of ""Murder She Wrote"" is how school teacher turned mystery writer Jessica Fletcher managed to be around when so many people were murdered. Personally, I think it's a conspiracy that Fletcher cooked up to sell books and that she framed everyone she exposes. That's my theory and I'm sticking to it. ""Murder She Wrote"" stuck around for an astonishing 264 episodes. Like ""Columbo"" (also created by co-producers/writers Richard Levinson and William Link), there's a solid formula at work on the series that hooks mystery fans as laid out in the 2 hour pilot episode (the cleverly titled ""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes"" also included).

Universal has done a solid job in this transfer. While there are some age related artifacts, colors are pretty good but there's plenty of dust and debris. This could easily have been cleaned up. It's also clear that there was no restoration done on this show. Considering the age of the series, I'm not surprised that this doesn't look as pristine as, say, ""24"". The good news is that these don't appear to be the syndicated versions that have been in play for some time (at least as far as I can tell from the running times). Since this was shot and aired prior to the advent of widespread stereo these early episodes are in mono but sound surprisingly spry. The dialogue is crisp and clear and it's not as muffled as the sound on other shows from the same time frame.

Extras? Where did they disappear to? This is a mystery that it would take Jessica Fletcher to crack. Where are the extras? Universal has been rushing out their TV productions at a breakneck pace as if to make up for their initial reluctance to put them out when DVD first became the standard. It appears that most of the marketing budget went into the nice package design and quality of the transfers (as well as advertising the set) as there's absolutely nothing in the way of extras. There's certainly enough trivia about the series to make a worthwhile featurette or two; Jean Stapleton (""All in the Family"") was first offered the role of Jessica and turned it down. How Angela Lansbury ended up on the radar for the role would be a very nice featurette. ""The Grand Old Lady"" episode of ""Murder She Wrote"" was written by Link and Levinson for their old TV show ""Ellery Queen"" nearly a decade before and was rewritten for the series. The marvelous William Windom who eventually became a semi-regular as Dr. Hazlett was originally cast as Sam Breen in the 21st episode of the first season. What's the story behind Windom becoming a regular? Windom (like Lansbury) is/was still around when this was prepared so why not a featurette on that (perhaps that'll be in a later set). Likewise,  haracter actor Ron Masak appeared during the first season but later became a semi-regular in 1988 but as a completely different character. Perhaps doing a featurette in the form of a mystery (not unlike one that Jessica might solve herself) about the creation of the series, casting and popularity might be an option for future sets. I doubt, though, that will happen.

Here's a novel idea that Universal might try for later seasons; ask some well regarded mystery writers who enjoyed the series to do a commentary track or two and how their characters might solve the mystery compared to Jessica Fletcher.

It's truly a mystery as to why this took such a long and torturous route to DVD, but fans will be happy that the show finally is at hand. While the image quality could be significantly better, it's not as bad as some TV shows that have been released to TV recently (""Twilight Zone: The 80's"" for example).  Now you can sit down and jog your memory to see if you remember the clues, the killers and the red herrings in the first season of ""Murder She Wrote"". Miss Marple would be proud of Jessica. Then again, there's a movie tie in here; let's see Miss Marple and Jessica battle and match wits to figure out why all those dead bodies drop around their respective heroines.",1112054400,8,4001,4.660056657223796

1526535,5,B00005JN8S,"Saying that the upcoming DVD release of Murder, She Wrote is long overdue is like saying chocolate is only an ""OK"" treat -- a world class understatement! In fact, ""world class"" describes this venerable series perfectly, from its multi-talented cast, interesting stories and production value. Murder, She Wrote is arguably the most beloved American TV mystery series, and for good reason.

The series began in 1984 when Angela Lansbury was 58 and continued through 1996 producing 264 episodes for CBS, and easily winning its time slot for most of its run.

The fabulous Ms. Lansbury, who as a distinguished career on Broadway and in the movies, portrayed the lead character of Jessica Fletcher, a widowed, childless English teacher from the fictional small seaport of Cabot Cove, Maine. (The exteriors of the homes, seaport and ocean scenes were actually shot on the opposite coast -- in Mendicino, Calif.)

In the series, Jessica's quiet and predictable life is abruptly turned upside down after her nephew submits a mystery manuscript she wrote under the name ""J.B. Fletcher"" to an East Coast publisher without her knowledge and the book is published. (In the show, Jessica's middle name is Beatrice.) The book becomes an instant bestseller, and Jessica-the-author continues to write similarly popular yarns until she becomes internationally famous. Equally famous is Jessica's uncanny knack at solving crimes as an amateur sleuth who is called upon to help by law enforcement from Cabot Cove to Europe and beyond as the series continues. (It is interesting to note that Jean Stapleton, who portrayed Edith Bunker on All in the Family, was first offered the role of Jessica but, thankfully, declined.)

Show creators Richard Levinson, William Link and Peter S. Fischer (Lansbury's real-life husband) brought an impressively combined resume that included Columbo, Mannix, Alfred Hitchcock Present and Ellery Queen.

In the show's premiere (included in this DVD release), Jessica's nephew Grady (portrayed throughout the series by Michael Horton) submits that fateful manuscript to a New York City publisher. Not only does that launch his beloved aunt's career, it quickly embroils her deeply into her first homicide investigation as well as a tragic love affair.

Each week, viewers were treated to the often murderous happenings in small town, quiet Cabot Cove, which ended up having at least 50 murders investigated by Jessica over the course of the series. Jessica helped the local constabulary there, initially bumbling Sheriff Amos Tupper, portrayed by Tom Bosley, then a more credible Sheriff, Mort Metzger, portrayed by Ron Masak, to solve whatever crime occurred.

Viewers also followed ""J.B."" around the world as she promoted her books on tour. Viewers were also treated to a fabulous character progression by Ms. Lansbury that took Jessica from a somewhat dowdy widow to a chic, sophisticated and internationally famous author of means and influence who helped citizens and governments alike. (She also helped a seemingly endless stream of nieces, nephews and other family members get out of trouble.)

Along the way, Ms. Lansbury was supported by brilliant charactor actor William Windom who portrayed crusty Dr. Seth Hazlitt and Jessica's closest friend. Hazlitt felt more than friendship for Jessica as the show continued, but unfortunately, the two were never officially brought together.

Broadway legends Len Cariou and the late Jerry Orbach (both friends of Ms. Lansbury) had recurring roles as British Intelligence Agent Michael Hagerty and Chicago Private Detective Harry McGraw, respectively. It was this role that provided Orbach with the opportunity to move on and join the cast of the celebrated Law & Order.

When the show began, Jessica was inexperienced and naive, the opening title sequence featuring an old manual typewriter upon which she pounded out her novels. When the series went off the air, Jessica maintained a second apartment in New York, had dined with kings and queens, been involved in international intrigue, dressed in the most stylish fashions -- and the opening sequence featured an up-to-date computer and printer! But, at the heart of the series was the heart Ms. Lansbury endowed her alter ego of Jessica, who never forgot her humble beginnings or her friends and remained a woman of integrity, compassion and warmth.

On the series, Ms. Lansbury was often able to showcase her many talents. Twice she played the dual role of her cousin Emma MacGill, a London dance hall performer. It is no coincidence that the singing and dancing Ms. Lansbury's given name is Angela Brigid MacGill Lansbury.

1526536,5,B00005JN8S,"I first started watching this show in syndication in the late 80's/early 90's.  I have always enjoyed the ""who done it?"" type shows and took to Jessica Fletcher immediatly.  On Saturday & Sunday afternoons I would watch it on the USA Network. The mid series episodes were the best I think, right before Sheriff Tupper left.  I liked Sherriff Metzger as well, but the episodes lost the chemistry that Jessica & Sherriff Tupper brought to them.  When Columbia House released episodes of the show on VHS, I immediatly started collecting them.  I had wished they had released the whole series then, but the tapes stopped comming after I had collected about half the series.  Also, the tapes contained two episodes from two different seasons.

1526694,5,B00005JN8S,"Murder, She Wrote was created with the CBS Sunday night prime audience of older viewers in mind; An audience that CBS had reveled in for countless years due to 60 Minutes.  Well, I was not one of those older viewers.

I was 14 when I started watching Murder, She Wrote in 1984.  Having grown up with shows like Columbo, Matlock, Remington Steele, Hart to Hart, Charlie's Angels, (the short-lived) Ellery Queen, and many others, I was very intrigued by this new show.  I didn't know who Angela Lansbury was or how the show would be structured.  All I knew was that I would get to play detective along with the lead, and that was all I needed to hear.  Created & written by the same team (Peter Fischer, Richard Levinson, and William Link) who'd created shows like Columbo, a deviously clever made-for-TV movie called 'Rehearsal for Murder' (which I had just seen the summer before MSW premiered), plus a whole slew of other shows to their credit, I knew MSW was bound to be a hit.  And a hit it was.

Filled with more celebrity guests than Oscar night, the show played fair with its audience, giving them the clues they needed to solve the crime(s) before the final 10 minutes of the show.  The flashbacks, helping to remind you what you may have missed, were an especially nice touch.  The writing was sharp, the storylines fun & original, and the production was first rate.  Of course, none of this would've mattered if the lead wasn't someone we liked.  Cue: Angela Lansbury.

Originally, the part of J.B. Fletcher was supposed to go to Jean Stapleton; Edith Bunker from All in the Family.  But Stapleton didn't want to do another series, so she turned the part down.  Lansbury was the studio's 2nd choice.  A veteran of stage and screen, Lansbury was the perfect fit for the role of J.B. Fletcher, a retired High School English teacher turned writer by her somewhat nave but absolutely adorable nephew, Grady, who turns in Fletcher's manuscript she wrote to fill the lonely times following her husband Frank's death to a New York publisher.  After becoming an immediate success, Fletcher is whisked off to her publisher's mansion where a costume party leads to the ultimate death of 2 of the stars of that evening's show.  Using common sense, some logic, and perseverance, J.B. solves the crime in the final 15 minutes and her fate is sealed.  She becomes the writer everyone adores who seems to find a murder (or two, or three...) to solve no matter where she goes.

Lansbury's charm was subtle but immediately contagious & recognizable.  She played Fletcher perfectly.  J.B. was no-nonsense but never derogatory.  She was practical, but not a stick-in-the-mud.  She was fun but she knew her limits.  She was fallible, compassionate, funny, smart, susceptible to deceit, and an all-around nice person.  In other words, she portrayed someone who could exist.  Someone we could root and care for.  Sure, there are countless many who couldn't believe the show's characters would even invite J.B. to an event given that there always seemed to be death following close behind her.  But, hey.  This was television.  And that was the whole premise of the show: A mystery writer turned murder solver.  There had to be some suspension of disbelief. And in the end, it was great television; watching what most criminals thought was a helpless old busybody foiling their crimes in a cool & calm style.

What most people may not know is that MSW was not a runaway hit during its 1st season that it eventually turned into.  The 1st season ratings were okay, but nothing stellar, and there was a time when it looked like MSW might not return for a 2nd season.  It was only during the first season's reruns that the show began to find its audience and pick up steam.  And by the time Season 2 started, the show was primed for broadcast.  After it did, there was no stopping it.

Never let it be said that Sunday nights during the mid to late 80's or early 90's were boring.  For 11 seasons Murder, She Wrote ate up the ratings on Sunday nights following 60 Minutes.  Unfortunately, its 12th season pitted it against Friends on Thursday nights when the then head of CBS, who didn't know what to do with the show after so many [successful] years, wanted to bury it for good.  And good he did.  Murder, She Wrote just couldn't survive the onslaught of Friends.  The show was cancelled after the 12th season, with the aptly entitled final episode `Death by Demographics'.  Lansbury did go on to appear in 4 Murder, She Wrote 2-hour TV ""movies"" over the next 6 years, (South by Southwest, A Story to Die For, The Last Free Man, and The Celtic Riddle).  None of them included members from the show (like Seth, Mort, or Grady), but they did help fill the void felt when Murder left the air in 1996.

Now the show seems to be finally making its way to DVD soon.  However, there are rumors on Universal Studios' website that the disks will be compiled in a `Best Of...' format.  I really hope that isn't the case, as I'll probably not purchase it if they are.  While Murder, She Wrote (like any other show) certainly had its share of dud episodes, they still lent credence to why this was one of the most successful shows of all time, even if CBS executives decided to murder it instead of nurturing it.

Let's just hope that Universal Studios gives its audience what it wants: The show, on DVD in order of broadcast, just like any other show.  J.B., Angela Lansbury, and their fans deserve some sweet justice after all these years...",1094601600,329,5514,4.638802889576883
