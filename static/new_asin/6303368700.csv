Lupin (or Rupan as he's called in this) sounds like he sat on his keys,  Zenigata sounds constapated, Jigen just sounds horrible (sounded like the  actor was trying to rip off the style of whoever did his voice in the Manga  release of Cagliostro) while Goemon and Fujiko have more fitting (yet lame)  voices. I hope that Streamline or Manga redo this one with thier actors,  but I'd still recommend it for any fan of the Lupin series.",966470400,,588,4.4485981308411215

7844511,3,6303368700,"Fuma Conspiracy is I'd say in the middle of the Lupin films in terms of quality. The animation is just superb, but the story isn't that exciting after the first half. It starts off with Goemon being married, but his newly wed is kidnapped and being held ransom for Goemon's family treasure. It starts off really good, and just dwindles down as the film goes on. Once the characters enter the lair the treasure is being held in, it becomes an overly long bore fest, but an amazingly animated one at least.

I'll mention Zenigata is one of my favorite things about he Lupin films, and the moment he first sees Lupin after thinking he had died (which leads to an excellent car chase) is brilliant!

There are some good action scenes, the soundtrack is awesome, the story had potential and the animation is superb. If the creators cut some length off of the back half of the film, it could've been really good, but the finally is just WAY too long and generic. Forgot to mention the dub, which is pretty mediocre outside of some good acting choices",1474156800,,1044,4.518518518518518

7844515,5,6303368700,"I have shamelessly used this movie to turn the sadly ignorant into raging Lupin III fans, and it's very nearly as effective as ""Castle of Cagliostro"" in doing so.  It has a very appealing animation style, a good story, fast pacing, a sense of humour, and pathos without being melodramatic (not that a little melodrama isn't good for the soul).

There are a few problems for me, but they're really all very minor.  One is that Jigen apparently drew the short straw and he doesn't get to do much throughout the entire film.  Sadness.  Another is that budget concerns during production prompted the hiring of a cheaper voice cast as opposed to getting the veteran voice actors back (and I mean Japanese voice cast - I don't watch dubbed anime).  Budget was also the reason given as to why one doesn't hear an excellent jazz score from Ohno Yuji, but rather music more typical of your usual anime feature.  To be honest, this is probably my biggest problem with the movie.

And to clear the air, the same budget concerns also meant that the movie was set entirely in Japan, so no one would have to be sent overseas to research a foreign locale.  Personally, I have no issue whatsoever, especially since a number of Lupin III features and episodes are also set in Japan.  You'd think the animators are, y'know, Japanese or something...

Also to clear the air, this is the first Lupin III OVA, and is not considered a theatrical release, even though it was released in cinemas for a limited run, thus the widescreen formatting.  This is actually not that unusual in Japan for 'direct-to-video' features to be a bit not-so-direct and see a short theatrical run.

One more note: while Lupin III has very little continuity, this is one of the few instances where one can see a bit of that.  This is the second time the Fuma ninja clan has appeared.  The first was in episode #36 (title: 'Reveal the Secret of Tsukikage-jo Castle') of the second TV series.  The Fuma clan has a third appearance as well, in the 22nd TV special from 2010, ""The Last Job.""  This is all done without any fanfare or reference of any kind, so there's no need to see them in order or even to see them all, period.  I suspect picking on the Fuma clan repeatedly was more an effort to maintain consistency rather than to establish continuity.",1400716800,,2307,4.571776155717761

7844517,5,6303368700,"if you love lupin u will love this movie! its one of the older ones, not made by the same american company as the others but is still awesome. even if you have never seen or heard of lupin the third i still think you would like this movie. action, adventure, and a few laughs along the way will keep you watching.",1267574400,2,313,4.064516129032258
7844518,3,6303368700,"The fuma conspiracy was one of the first movie with Lupin the third and his gang. Goemon is about to get married, is bride is kidnapped and the adventure unfolds.
The movie is nice, though I do not think it is as imaginative as 'The castle of cagliostro', as visually beautiful as 'the secret of mamo' or as hectic as, let's say, 'farewell to nostradamus' where Lupin went from Brazil to the USA to some mysterious island (which looked a lot like the island in 'the island of assassins'), and again to Brazil and the USA.
the Fuma conspiracy is all set in Japan. It's about finding a treasure (as was 'dead or alive') as much as it is about rescuing Goemon's bride.
The characters are less convincing than usual: Goemon goes from being a confident soon-husand-to-be to being a guy who's nervous and insecure around women (as he was in castle of cagliostro). Zenigata and Jigen are a bit flat. Fujilo is neither the unreliable (yet loving) woman that can be seen in the secret of mamo nor in the nostradamus movie nor the relatively loyal member of the gang that can be seen in 'missed by a dollar'. But the major problem is with Lupin. He is not as central as he should be and was in other movies, he's not supersmart, heroic, appealing villain of most Lupin movies nor the sweeter character designed by Miyazaki in Cagliostro. He is there, but never displays his usual genius.
So while the movie is worth watching anyway, it is not as good as it could have been",1194566400,5,1462,4.479400749063671
7844519,4,6303368700,"While there's still some debate among the fans as to whether this was movie instead of an OVA, Lupin III: The Plot Of The Fuma Clan was in fact the very first OVA starring the famous thief. It did have a limited theatrical run in Japan to promote the movie(similar to a certain Pony movie!), but this was an early OVA during the mid-80s. It features a few different voice actors from the regular cast in the Japanese edition. It was released originally in America by Animeigo using the name ""Rupan"" instead of Lupin apparently due to international copyright involving the original French Lupin character, even though it didn't stop Streamline Pictures from using ""Lupin"" in their releases including the original dub of Castle Of Cagliostro. This has recently though been re-released through Discotek Media along with some other Lupin anime.

 The actually acts as a follow-up to the second manga series where Lupin was thought to be dead by the rest of the world after an explosion on a boat. Thinking this, Inspector Zenigata had retired with his family to becoming a Buddhist munk. But, Lupin comes out of hiding after his mate, the swordsman Goemon, when his bride Murasaki gets bridenapped by the modern day ninja originization, the Fuma Clan. The Fuma want Murasaki to get her family's ancient treasure, which is a lost stash of hidden gold. Zenigata comes out of retirement to take on the case, although its revealed early on that his subordinate is really an agent for the Fuma. After several great chase sequences, our heroes manage to rescue Murasaki, and make their way to the mountain cave where the treasure lies. However, this cave is filled with more traps than Indiana Jones could deal with. The Fuma corner the Lupin gang at the subterranean castle of gold, with their leader getting into an thrilling duel with Goemon. But the gold kingdom starts to cave in, burying the Fuma. Lupin & Co. escape, with Zenigata in hot pursuit.

 You can really tell the difference in how more emphasis was given to the quality of animation in this one than the previous three Lupin movies. Granted, Cagliostro is great mainly because Hiyao Miyazaki was at the helm of it, but The Fuma Conspiracy holds it on well enough with the attention given to the movement of the characters. The fight sequences and chase scenes are exceptionally fine considering the time they came out in. The story is a little against the norm of your average Lupin flick as it takes place entirely in Japan, as opposed to in some exotic location. It's certainly worth a look, even though you might want to check it out in the original Japanese only as the American dub is a little stale.",1010534400,,2662,4.7429805615550755
