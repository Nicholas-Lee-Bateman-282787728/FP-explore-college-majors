2471953,5,B000CRR39W,"This is a great item for Mets fans....All 7 World Series games in their entirety and the big bonus is game 6 of the NLCS in its entire 5 hour 16 inning entirety....These games have been replayed countless times on ESPN Classic and MSg in EDITED versions where you only see half the game and do not get a feel for them...This is all the games in their entirety.....Also gives you perspective on the entire World Series (not just the games the Mets won) You see the Mets struggle through Games 1&2 and Gooden pitch awful in Games 2 and 5..(considering his off the field drug troubles started shortly after you wonder what he was doing behind the scenes before these 2 games...Game 5 was also a solidly played game even though the Mets lost...Sid Fernandez pitched great out of the pen with 4 shutout innings which would be a harbinger of things to come (his Game 7 relief outing saved the season...Reliving this set reminds you that Lenny Dykstra should have been Series MVP and Mets MVP for the 86 season because he carried the Mets on his shoulders in Games 3 and 4 when they looked ready to combust.....Plus Lenny had the game winning HR against Houston in Game 3 of the LCS and started the huge rally in the 9th inning of Game 6 of the LCS......

Brilliant DVD set--about time these games have been released in their entirety",1143676800,11,1327,4.483471074380165
2471954,5,B000CRR39W,"First of all this is the best DVD boxed set that I've ever owned. I was only 15 when the Mets won it all in 1986 and I was thrilled to hear that a DVD of all seven games was coming out. I watched it all over again. There is a reason why I became a Met fan in 1975 (yes I was only 3 but I liked it anyway)and this is it. I can't believe that it's been 20 years since the Mets' last championship. This was the greatest World Series ever. With the Mets down to their last strike they came back and won game 6. And they still had to play a game 7 which they won of course.

This dvd set is packed with so many extras like the 1987 world championship ring ceremony, interviews with past Mets telling how it was. Even Bill Buckner is in this thing (besides his most famous/infamous play) saying ""I don't know what the big deal is. We still had to play game 7""

Details:
Disc 1:Game 6 NLCS The 16 inning thriller in it's entirety. One of the best games in baseball history. You'll be amazed.

disc 2-8:All 7 world series games in their entirety. And yes even the most famous play in Baseball history is in there.

disc 9: Interviews highlights and a whole lot more

To sum it up 1986 was the greatest year in Mets history. Now if they put out 1969 then I'll truly be happy",1143590400,16,1265,4.0239043824701195
2471955,5,B000CRR39W,"From the perspective of the history of baseball in the 20th century the storyline in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 6 of the 1986 World Series was that the Boston Red Sox were a strike away from winning their first World Championship since 1918. However, in terms of the 1986 baseball season the story was that the New York Mets, having won 108 games during the regular season, were one strike away from blowing the series having been big favorites. But the Mets started this one behind, when Bruce Hurst pitched eight scoreless innings in the opener and Boston won 1-0. Then there was the anticlimactic meeting in Game 2 between 1985 National League Cy Young winner Dwight Gooden and 1986 American League Cy Young winner Roger Clemens, where neither starter lasted five innings and it was Boston's bullpen that game out ahead 9-3. So New York dropped the first two games at home and would never have the series lead until Game 7.

The Mets returned the favor in Boston by winning the first two games behind Bob Ojeda and Ron Darling before Hurst won his second game and gave Gooden his second loss to return to Queens up 3 games to 2. Clemens and Ojeda both pitched well in Game 6, which was deadlocked 3-3 after nine innings. Then came what is probably the most famous inning in World Series history. The Red Sox scored two runs in the top of the 10th on a Dave Henderson homerun and a Marty Barrett double. Calvin Schiraldi came out of the bullpen and retired the first two Mets in the bottom of the 9th. Then came three singles, a wild pitch, and the most famous error in World Series history to set up Game 7 (Hack Wilson losing the ball in the sun in 1929 was not an error and when Fred Snodgrass dropped the ball in Game 8 in 1912 was not recorded for posterity on videotape).

Two points to be made regarding this particular moment of baseball immortality. First, even if Bill Buckner (or Dave Stapleton) had fielded the ball cleanly the game was still tied and Boston was in a complete state of shock. You would have to like the momentum the Mets have going at that point (although I believe that Buckner was the next batter due up for the Sox). Second, just as was the case the last time the Red Sox were involved in Game 6 heroics with Carlton Fisk's celebrated home run in 1975, a lot of people forget that Game 7 was pretty good too. The Red Sox recovered well enough to take a 3-0 lead after homer by Dwight Evans and Rich Gedman, the Mets came back--on Schiraldi no less--to win the game.

In 1986 we saw a World Series where the home team dropped the first four games and then did a complete reversal with last bats getting the final three games. True, the Red Sox always seem to manage to lose Game 7 of the World Series, but that simply makes it smart to just sweep their opponents like they did last year when they finally won it all in our lifetime (all of the mysteries of life should be that easy to solve). Yes, this 1986 World Series video is a joy for Mets fans, but the fact that at the time it was yet another painful reminder of that Curse thing is now starting to recede into the dim past along with people hitting .400 and the like.  But for those of us who are neither Mets nor Red Sox fans (in the long run), this was a memorable Fall Classic and the second of three in a row in which the home team came back from down 3-2 to win.

""New York Mets: 1986 World Series Collector's Edition"" is not a highlight video.  It gives you the broadcasts of all seven games of the World Series, which is enough to get most Mets fans on board right there.  But in addition to the entire series and a bunch of post-series extras there is also the sixth and final game of the 1986 National League Championship series where the Mets took 16 innings to beat the Houston Astros.  Houston scored three runs off of Ojeda in the bottom of the 1st and the Mets waited until the top of the 9th to tie the score with three runs off of Bob Knepper.  The Mets scored in the top of the 14th and the Astros answered in the bottom of the inning.  Even when the Mets scored three runs in the 16th, the Astros scored twice to make it a one run differential.  After the came Len Dykstra told reporters, ""It's going to be very tough for the World Series to match this playoff.""  Boy, was he wrong.",1141171200,20,4303,4.279212792127922

2471965,5,B000CRR39W,"I bought this for my elderly mother, who is a big fan of the old Mets; and who had weatched all these games when they originally aired live in '86, when we lived a few miles from Shea Stadium. Just for grits and shins, I thought I'd give them a look (I am NOT a fan of spectator sports of any kind!)- mainly as an historical adventure, and to relive old times.

Wow! I ended up watching all the games! These are historic games! At first, I was disappointed that Tim McCarver's commentary was only on one game (The NLS play-off)...but I have to say, that after watching these games, I did thoroughly enjoy Joe Garagiola's and Vin Skully's calling of the games!

Picture quality seemed fine to me, on a 43"" plasma. I even ended up buying another set of these for my brother-in-law!

Just the fact that I- a rabid anti-sports fan, could watch and enjoy these...really says something!

And to those who may have young'uns who are baseball fans.....let 'em watch these games- they will be amazed, and get to see some unique things, as well as some great players!  What really amazed me, is how well the teams (in both the last play-off game, as well as the Series) were so well matched! It seemed that the tems which lost, deserved to win just as much as the Mets did. It really came down to a matter of luck and circumstances, which determined the outcome of this series.",1378944000,,1367,4.408730158730159

2471967,5,B000CRR39W,"Im not just saying that because Im  from New york.  I am glad this is out for everyone to own for posterity. I was 10 years old in 1986, the perfect age for all this. The end of game 6 still makes me cry 25 years after the fact, the bizarre finish and Vin scully's awesome call ""Behind the bag...Mets win it!"" still get to me. Forget Game 6 1975, great game, but 86 game 6 is the greatest baseball game of all time. The 1986 mets are the greatest ball team of all time. Ive seen them all from 1983- present and anything before on video and Im still convinced. Im a fan of the game first. What a time it was to live through, what a summer and fall and Im honored to have been  living at  the time to witness  2 of the ""greatest games"" in the top ten according to MLB.Both are on this set. THe other game is the NLCS Game 6. Youve probably heard all about this so if youve never seen it, and you are a true fan of the game, buy it, you won't regret it. Ocassionally being in New york you run into someone who was at game 6, I just wonder what that was like,  a crazy scene we can only guess at from the video!",1315267200,,1107,3.8761061946902653

2471970,5,B000CRR39W,"One of the best purchases I have made recently!  My husband is a big Mets fan and he kept telling me stories about the 86 series--fantastic!  The extra features related to the Natl League Championship Series was an excellent bonus.

Thanks again.",1252540800,,246,4.809523809523809
2471971,5,B000CRR39W,"Ok, so it's been a long time since 1986, but Mets fans are as patient as death and always have been. For the painful early years the Mets faithful came and rooted their Lovable Losers on until in 1969 a miracle occurred and the Mets won their first World Series.

Now simple math tells you that from 1969 to 1986 the wait was longer, but having been there for both of the wins (and the close call in 1973), I can tell you the while every World Championship is sweet, 1986 was sweet to the Nth degree. Because not only did the Mets win, but the snatched victory for the jaws of defeat...and they snatched it from the jaws of the Boston Red Sox.

Now, it's harder, watching through nostalgia tinted eyes, to hate the 1986 Sox as much as I've hated them since they finally kicked the curse and became one of the most successful teams of the 21st century (oooo I hate them now). They had some great, great players back then. But I remember hating them pretty hard at the time, and watching the Mets refuse to lose game six, then come from behind again to win game seven was ber sweet. The famous Buckner play still makes me grin like an idiot.

So not only are the games all here for your re-enjoyment, but the bonus disc is packed with great interviews, the post-game locker room celebration, etc. It will make the Mets fan proud all over again.

Now, how about a new world championship, guys?",1243036800,,1390,4.334615384615384
2471972,5,B000CRR39W,I was very pleased with this DVD.  I will definitely watch it over and over again.,1238198400,,82,4.125
2471973,5,B000CRR39W,"This to me was almost a tale of 2 different World Series.

The Boston Red Sox bizarre year began with Dwight Evans hitting the first pitch of the season for a homerun off Jack Morris of the Detroit Tigers in Detroit. Then there was a mid season game against the California Angels where their pitcher BALKED in the Sox' winning run in the bottom of the ninth. Follow that with Dave Henderson's historic homerun off California's Donnie Moore with 2 out and 2 strikes in the top of the 9th to pull ahead in the 5th game of the playoffs. California was leading in games, 3-1, at the time. The Angels tied that game, but the Sox won in the 11th I believe, forcing games 6 and 7 back in Boston. They blew the Angels away in those 2 games to earn the right to face the Mets.

The Mets, meanwhile, blew the National League away all season long, until they had to face the Houston Astros in the playoffs. A very even series ensued, culminating with that 14 inning THRILLER in game 6, which is part of this dvd set. That game 6 was very signifigant because an Astros win meant that the Mets would have to face Mike Scott, who had been almost unhittable all series long. Scott had, in face culminated the division clinching weekend in Houston. Nolan Ryan had pitched a 2 hitter at the San Francisco Giants, followed by Jim Deshaies one hitter, and Scott's no hitter put the division on ice for Houston. I think this 3 game performance was unprecedented in MLB at that point.

Now we come to the World Series, after such strange things had been happening to both clubs all season long. Why shouldn't such a series have so many unfathomable things happen in it?

For those of you who have or get this disk set, watch for Sox catcher Rich Gedman in that famous 10th inning of game 6 at Shea. True, Schiraldi was getting banged around a little. In my opinion, it was GEDMAN, not Bill Buckner who sealed the Red Sox' fate when he backhanded a Bob Stanley pitch, instead of shifting as catchers are trained to do with men on base. As a catcher you are supposed to move your body over to keep the ball in front of you, ala what a hockey goalie might do. Mr. Gedman did not do this and Kevin Mitchell scored the tying run for the Mets. But for that, Buckner's ""error"" would never have happened.

This was great theater all around, whether you root for the Mets or the Red Sox. I'm a Red Sox fan, and I still love watching it and picking it apart. I was pained like everyone else in New England, I hurt for weeks over this. I KNEW the Sox would lose game 6 the moment the ball got by Gedman. When the Mets won it, I knew the Sox had no chance in game 7.

One thing I will always love about that series is the commentary of the GREAT Vin Scully, and Joe Garagiola. They were a part of the show, but also knew when to let the happenings on the field be the show. I don't believe that there is any broadcaster who can do that today. Scully has a voice that will lull one to sleep because he always sounds so reassuring. Garagiola was the perfect compliment to Vin. We won't see their like again. They are missed by me today and always will be. Scully was so good that I even looked forward to hearing him on golf telecasts, which he also did for awhile for NBC.

In many ways, this set was as good, to me, as the 2004 Sox victory over the Cardinals in the World Series, albeit for different reasons. This is a MUST have for any Sox fan, as much as for any Mets fan. Bon Appetit.",1228780800,4,3455,4.209969788519637

2471982,1,B000CRR39W,"Regarding the ""ghosted"" MLB logo referred to in other reviews, I have to say that it really diminishes the enjoyment of watching this classic series on DVD. Not only is it totally unecessary(Who doesn't know they're watching Major League Baseball?), but it's placement is not so much in the upper right corner of the picture, but more like the upper right center of the picture, thus constantly intruding into the action. What in the world were they thinking? Rent it or borrow it, but don't buy it! It's great that they are putting baseball classics on DVD, but until A&E and MLB re-think this idiotic product branding, I'd say this set isn't worth buying.",1148428800,18,657,4.771929824561403
2471983,4,B000CRR39W,"When I first came across this set, and discovered it was going to contain eight games, I assumed they would be the four wins against Houston in the NLCS, and the four wins against the Red Sox in the World Series. I was disappointed to learn that they were the seven Series games, along with just Game 6 of the Houston series. I have to wonder why this decision was made. Quite frankly, if I'm going to be dropping this much dough, I don't want to be paying for Mets LOSSES. I would love to have the full games on DVD of the three other wins in the NLCS, especially Game 3, which a pre-steroids Lenny Dykstra won with a 2-run home run off Dave Smith in the bottom of the ninth, and Game 5, which was won in extra-innings by a hit from Gary Carter off a big, dumb redneck named Charlie Kerfeld, who had run his fat mouth earlier in the series, disparaging the Mets and their fans. The sight of that clown walking off the mound while the Mets celebrated behind him is one of the classic images from this great season. These moments are included in the extras, but again, having the complete games would have been nice, and it just seems like common sense to have included them, instead of World Series losses which I can guarantee will almost never see the inside of my DVD player.
  All that being said, it's great to have pristine DVD copies of all the Mets Series wins, especially Games 3 and 4 at Fenway, after the Red Sox fans, delusional as always, thought they were headed for a sweep after their team's wins at Shea. And it goes without saying that Games 6 and 7 will be watched many times by Mets fans, as they contain some of the greatest game moments in franchise history, which don't really need detailing here, we all know what they are.
  Of course, every true Met fan will want to own this collection, despite the slightly dubious choice of games. It would have rated five stars had they included all eight post-season wins, but I'm downgrading it to four for this reason.",1146268800,6,1984,4.354054054054054

The '86 team is probably my all time favorite and I have enjoyed reliving Game 6 of the playoffs and the World Series.  One disappointment that has not been noted.  The dvds all carry the major league symbol ""ghosted"" in the upper right corner.  Networks usually put their ghosted logo in the lower right (as opposed to the upper right), where it is less disturbing.  For whatever reason, A&E has chosen a more visible placement.
