7972646,4,B00006RCOD,I grew up with the disney version in my mind so I wasn't to impressed with this version The cartoon were cute and would be good for five year olds that havnt seen disineys version. I remember the disney movie being a little long for me. Some of the younger kids in the theater were scared of the whale and cried. This version of pinocchio is perfect for the small one to watch....,1388361600,,380,4.219178082191781
7972647,2,B00006RCOD,"My son received this as a gift for Christmas and I wasn't very impressed.  The storyline is pretty stupid and Pinocchio is just annoying.  The animation is bad, too, and, I noticed that the animators seem to have an obsession with characters sweating that I found to be quite odd (and almost annoying).  That said, my three year old loves it.  There is a scene at the end where they shoot Pinocchio that I don't think is appropriate for a a kid so young so this one is going to be put away until my son gets a little older.",1200700800,2,523,4.2
7972648,2,B00006RCOD,I was diappointed in this european version of pinnochio.  It was poorly done; story line and all.  I'll stick with an american version and walt disney's productions at all times from now on.,1168646400,,190,4.7272727272727275
7972649,1,B00006RCOD,"This Pinocchio, from 1984, is possibly the worst remake in movie history. The original, 1940, Disney Pinocchio, was one of the greatest movies ever made, with Oscar-winning music and songs by Leigh Harline, Paul Smith and Ned Washington; an alternately scary and hilarious story; vivid characters; striking animation; and gifted voice performers. By contrast, this Japanese-American version has a limp screenplay; forgettable characters; lousy voice acting; and animation that wouldn't pass muster for the cheesiest, PBS TV cartoon show. That IMDB doesn't list the names of any of the voice performers, may be a blessing for their careers. Get the original Pinocchio, and avoid this one like a bad street.
Now to the problem: Disney has inexplicably discontinued the original Pinocchio. Thus, the only way to view it is via expensive used copies on sale through Amazon ($36-45), or through renting it from a video outlet. I hope that the geniuses at Disney aren't preparing to loose a politically correct replacement on the world. Hopefully, they have a deluxe DVD in the works. Prayers may be called for.
