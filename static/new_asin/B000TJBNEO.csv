2903385,1,B000TJBNEO,"While new star Helena Mattsson will most likely take your breath away, there is absolutely nothing else in ""Species: The Awakening"" to keep your interest for more than five minutes.  As a big fan of the original Species and to a lesser degree its first sequel, it's painful to watch these straight to video sequels turn the series in to straight up sci-fi cheese. Every trace of intelligence the series once had has been flushed away with the past two ""films"".  ""Species: The Awakening"" is simply a boring, poorly acted, poorly scripted piece of garbage with terrible ""rubber suit"" special effects and laughably bad dialog.  Even beautiful women like the aforementioned Helena Mattson can no longer save this series from imploding on itself.  Sil would be turning over in her grave.....",1192320000,13,786,4.977099236641221

2903402,3,B000TJBNEO,"Another blonde half human half alien creature (Helena Mattsson as Miranda Hollander) wrecks havoc on anyone who gets in her way.  In this version, the alienesque Miranda is dying of old age and needs to be fixed pronto.  After killing a battery of employees at a local hospital, her faux uncle (Ben Cross) decides a road trip to Mexico might be the solution as there's a dubious scientist there (Dominic Keating as Forbes Maguire) who could provide the cure.  This means poor professor Miranda has to give up her post at PU (Parker University).  Once in Mexico, Uncle Tom runs into a killer alien nun and a really bad taxi driver before finding his old buddy Forbes, hard at work cloning half alien replicas of dead relatives (this sideline also includes dead pets).

Yes, Miranda the alien loses her clothes at the most opportune moments.  Yes, she is desperate to procreate.  Yes, the bodies begin to pile up.  So what makes this entry different from the others in this series?  Absolutely no sign of Natasha Henstridge.

This version was obviously done on the cheap.  When they decided they needed to scale back on the budget the first thing to go was a decent script, the second thing to go was someone willing to pay the lighting bill.  This film is mostly shot at night, in the dark, with little to no available light, or candle light, or flashing lights.  The actors appear mostly in silhouette (practically shadow puppets).  There are moments when it is impossible to tell what is going on.  It's barely adequate as a sci-fi flick.  But there are enough basic thrills to provide some entertainment value.  It is, though, the weakest entry in the franchise.",1401321600,2,1664,4.722222222222222

2903405,4,B000TJBNEO,"Entertaining movie with two gorgeous butts, one Swedish and one Mexican.  Did not try to make sense of the story, just went with the flow.  I do not think they can make a sequel of this one,",1369353600,,190,4.108108108108108
2903416,1,B000TJBNEO,"""Species III"" is one of the worst sci-fi sequels that I have ever been subjected to, and I fully expected ""Species IV: The Awakening"" to be just as bad. And as far as the plot goes, it is -- a giant gaping maw of massive plot holes, silly science and never-answered questions, with a denouement that will leave you depressed. However, some of the acting is at least decent, especially from Ben Cross.

College professor Miranda Hollander (Helena Mattsson) has lived with her uncle Tom (Cross) for most of her life, and seems to be a perfectly normal young woman. But one night she vanishes, and is found naked and unconscious in a park. After being rushed to a hospital, she transforms into an alien creature and promptly kills everyone she meets.

Horrified, Tom immediately whisks her down to Mexico. He also makes a shocking admission: she's actually an alien hybrid who conveniently generated a bunch of false memories and blocked out all her real ones.

Now something has gone wrong with her alien physiology, and he needs a guy named Forbes (Dominic Keating) to cure her. But as he searches for Forbes, Tom finds that there are other alien hybrids roaming through the city -- and even if they are able to save Miranda from certain death, it may unleash the other, alien side of her.

There are so many holes in ""Species IV: Awakening"" that it sometimes resembles pantyhose dragged through a rose garden. There is SO much in it that doesn't make sense -- for instance, the only cure for Miranda's failing alien DNA is to inject her with human DNA.... which somehow intensifies her alien side. I may not be a scientist, but that doesn't seem to make sense.

And that is only ONE of the massive plot holes. There are dozens more, including the question of HOW the scientists got alien DNA in the first place, and how Forbes has gotten away with creating mentally-retarded alien clones that may randomly decide to kill people in public.

Even if you can overlook the stupidity of the plot, ""Species IV: The Awakening"" is still a disaster. Characters flit in and out as convenience demands (the stereotypical Texan), and the last third lapses into a sea of rather unsexy sex and nudity. Occasionally an alien-hybrid will try to kill somebody, but it's never really explained WHY they are trying to kill people.

But I have to admit... some of the acting is decent. Cross really does give a good performance here -- in fact, it's far better than the movie deserves. He really captures the sorrow and desperation of a man whose ""daughter"" is dying, and the only way to save her is to sacrifice his morals. Mattsson also gives a pretty good performance as an alien girl who doesn't really know what she is, although Keating's pseudo-Australian hamfest is a bit tiring.

""Species IV: The Awakening"" is a giant oozing mass of plot holes and contrivances, and just trying to follow it will give you a headache. The only saving grace is some of the acting... and it's not nearly enough.",1367020800,2,2980,4.673664122137405

2903421,5,B000TJBNEO,"This is definitely one of the best films of the series; nevermind that, it is the best SyFy channel movie I have ever seen (and that's saying something cause most of the SyFy movies are utter trash).  One of the things that makes me really mad is how many amazon.com reviews trash this film.

Most SyFy channel movies make the fatal mistake of playing to stereotypes; too much action, bad plot, and weak characters.  Species The Awakening avoids all these pitfalls and develops a truly fantastic story.  Instead of bombarding the viewer with senseless violence, this story questions the morals and ethics of the characters and presents a critical and central theme in the story.

I believe the reason that most of the people gave this movie a bad review was because they just wanted to see nudity and senseless violence typical of most SyFy movies.  Unlike the previous Species movies, this one doesn't rely on nudity and action to sell its story and I think that's what make me respect this movie so much more than the others.

As for the other fans who claim that this film had bad acting, etc.; it is important to remember that this is a SyFy channel movie we're talking about and this film actually turned out better than most of the films that company produces (it's even better than its predecessor, Species 3, which was truly poor).  I recognized that SyFy movies ended up bad when I saw this film so I allowed myself to accept that this movie may have some weak spots, but those were practically nonexistent and I was pleasantly surprised that way.  When watching this movie, it is important for the viewer to not see it as a true sequel to the first film (indeed, the storyline does seem to diverge from the themes in the first one), but as a great reimagining of the story.",1335571200,2,1783,4.581761006289308
2903422,4,B000TJBNEO,"Having viewed the, unrated, fourth installement of the Species movie series, I must give it a four star rating.  In my opinion, it wasn't as interesting as the first film.  And although I am a fan of this specific movie title, I just have one concern.  Each successive film, after the initial one, proceeds to get more risque than its predecessor.  I understand  that some explaination has to be included about the sexual proclivities of these alien creatures.  But, it appears that their exploits get bolder with each new venture.  I thought that it was tastefully propounded and displayed in the first installment of the series. Perhaps, it was because I had an unrated copy.  And, that was the reason for the blatant sexual displays.  in closing, I'll still purchase this film series, anyway, because I want to find out if the screenwriters will allow the scientific community to destroy these creatures.",1331510400,,907,4.9144736842105265

2903425,3,B000TJBNEO,"Species: The Awakening (2007), the fourth film in the Species saga, takes just a few threads from the established Species story, and constructs a new adventure that stands up fairly well, if you are not overly critical.  The Sci Fi Channel production features some respectable special effects, heavy duty tongue action, and some new variations of the familiar female Species creature.

For many years scientist Tom Hollander (Ben Cross) has been hiding a dark secret.  His ""niece"" Miranda (Helena Mattsson) is actually the product of experiments crossing alien and human DNA, conducted by Hollander, and his brilliant former student, Forbes McGuire (Dominic Keating).  Raising the girl from a baby, Hollander has been keeping Miranda's alien side under control, by injecting certain hormones.  Unfortunately after the young woman transforms into alien form, she kills a number of people at a hospital.  Hollander rescues her, and spirits her away to Mexico, where his former partner McGuire is still engaged in DNA splicing.

The Hollanders locate McGuire, who informs them that Miranda is dying, and her only hope is to go through a procedure that requires the sacrifice of a human for their genetic material.  Azura (Marlene Favela), like Miranda, is also part alien and part human.  She was created by McGuire, and is his helper, and lover.  With Azura's help, Tom Hollander brings back a woman to provide the required DNA to save Miranda.  McGuire completes the procedure to extend Miranda's life, but her alien side takes over, and she departs to fulfill her desire to mate.  Upset at the disruptions that the Hollanders have caused, Azura repeatedly tries to kill Tom.  The film transitions to include some nicely executed action sequences, and concludes explosively, wrapping up (at least for now) the loose ends.

Directed by Nick Lyon, Species: The Awakening is fairly well paced, and concludes strongly, without going totally over the edge (although McGuire's high tech lab comes real close).  The simplistic and primal motivations of the characters, is typical for a Species film.  Hardly the action hero type, Ben Cross gives a solid performance, bringing seriousness and a kind of charming awkwardness to his role.  The frequent nudity by Helena Mattsson and Marlene Favela, mostly fits within the context of the film, as it is often spliced with visions of the alien persona (again, typical for the Species films).  When Miranda is out on the town, Azura also lets her wild side loose, setting up a final confrontation between the two aliens, which is highlighted by a rubber-suited girl fight.  Not great by any means, but for fans of the franchise, this fourth installment is a pretty good addition, to a series that might be close to being played out.",1304121600,,2768,5.097560975609756
2903446,2,B000TJBNEO,"Species was designer H.R. Giger's hetero- answer to the rampant male violation present in Aliens.  He transferred everything icky about the xenomorphs to the female form, where any body part (and I mean ANY part) can sprout a maw-tipped tentacle. Anime's been at this for years, so it's only logical that live action eventually caught up to it.

In this latest direct-to-video effort Miranda Hollander (Helena Mattsson) is a knockout with super-model looks who also happens to be a brilliant professor. She, incredulously, lives with her ""uncle"" Tom Hollander (Ben Cross). On Miranda's birthday she suddenly suffers a mysterious illness that causes her to go on an alien rampage.  Tom rescues Miranda before the authorities can catch her and flees to Mexico.

On the way, Tom explains that Miranda is actually a mad scientist's dream girl, created from combined human and alien DNA.  He and Forbes McGuire (Dominic Keating) created her as a college science experiment. Miranda has been living a lie, fed a cover story about her non-existent parents and secretly injected nightly by Tom with human hormones to suppress her alien DNA. Now Tom is returning her to Forbes, the only person who will know how to help poor Miranda.

Finding Forbes only creates more questions.  It appears the rascal has been using his DNA-magic to splice deceased pets back to life and selling them to rich owners. If you thought that the rat at the end of the first movie might be a problem, it seems Forbes pretty much heralded the end of life as we know it...but never you mind about that.  Forbes offers a devil's deal: the only way to keep Miranda alive is to inject ""fresh"" human DNA into Miranda, which will kill the donor.  Miranda, horrified by the thought of taking (another) life refuses. The decision is taken out of her hands when she falls unconscious again.

Tom, who loves Miranda like a daughter, refuses to give up.  He ventures into Mexico's seediest clubs searching for a victim but ends up getting mugged in the process. Tom is rescued by Azura (Marlene Favela), one of Forbes' living alien dolls that he unscrupulously uses to sate his libido. Voila! Instant human DNA donor for Miranda. The procedure doesn't go quite as planned, however, and when Miranda awakens she's fertile and in alien heat.

It seems Forbes has left quite a few of his alien/human hybrids roaming about, and it's not long before there's a good ole fashioned alien showdown between Azura (demonic brunette) and Miranda (angelic blonde). Queue the nudity, special effects, and explosions.

Awakening goes back to the series roots in focusing on hot alien chicks that kill their human mates. Stripped of the big-budget production values of the first movie, Awakening's flaws peek through its gauzy plot. Very little makes sense, and the entire set up is really just an excuse for the battle between two alien hotties in full xenomorph mode.

In that regard Awakening is actually an improvement on the previous two sequels. If this latest installment is any indication, we haven't seen the end of tongue-thrusting alien hotties.",1297814400,,3097,4.942196531791907
2903447,5,B000TJBNEO,"This is an old fashioned movie that relies 95% on plot instead of special effects or nudity. The greatest special effects that took place was the explosion that took place at the end of the movie.

You do not need to know anything about the other three Species movies to understand this one.

If you simply view this movie as a stand alone (no comparison to the other 3 Species movies), you will be left stunned.

I have no problem recommending this one be bought as new. There is no cheese is you view this without comparison to the special effects of the other 3 Species movies.

The acting is very good. The plot is very good and based upon the love of ""Uncle Tom"" wishing to extend the life of his half-alien ""neice"" Miranda. At no point does Uncle Tom give into lust - his love for his beautiful ""neice"" Miranda remains true to the end. He helped to create her and was basically her father.

This movie moves FAST. Nothing slow about the plot. There are no extra scenes than are necessary.

Don't cheat yourself. This IS a movie to be viewed solely as a stand alone and should not be compared to the other 3 Species movies. Buy it new!

It is my hope that there will be a Species 5. I can imagine how good it could be if it had BOTH plot AND special effects!",1279411200,4,1263,4.2375
2903448,4,B000TJBNEO,"The actors were good in this film.  I agree with the other reviewer about the 'rest stop"" scene being awkward, but even more awkward was the scene where she tries to get her uncle to breed with her. THAT should have been omitted.  However, the actors DID save that scene with some dignity in tact, since the producer(s) left it in. It did stick true to the ideal that Tom loved Miranda like a daughter and couldn't conceive of such an act, so she left to find someone else.  I liked the plot and such--just not that particular scene. The rest stop scene was awkward, but if the other scene had gone totally left, it would have ruined the entire movie.  At least Helena Mattson was not miscast and she did a great job, and so did Ben Cross.",1261785600,6,739,4.294964028776978

2903452,2,B000TJBNEO,"SPECIES IV is undoubtedly the weakest of the four movies in the SPECIES canon, an unrated direct-to-video release that, like all one-a-half-star movies is both very good and very bad at the same time.

The lovely, luminescent and incredibly blonde Helena Mattsson plays Miranda, the half-human, half-alien creature. Ms. Mattson is far more reminiscent of Nicole Kidman than Natasha Henstridge from the original SPECIES. Her acting is fine, but not arrestingly good.

SPECIES 4 falls down simply because it's essentially a retread.

Miranda, a gifted college professor, is under the watchful eye of her Uncle Tom (Ben Cross), in reality the genetic scientist who created her from a mix of female creature DNA and human female DNA. He has never told her who and what she is. Miranda falls ill. Her illness causes her feral aspects to become dominant. Uncle Tom tries desperately to cure her, resorting to some very questionable tactics to do so. The ethical Miranda is outraged, but as her disease progresses, her humanity slips away and she becomes increasingly predatory, seeking to mate and kill. Not much else needs to be said. It's SPECIES redux.

SPECIES 4 is well-made but limited, an unremarkable film that nonetheless holds the viewer's attention and entertains despite it's predictability.",1197590400,17,1297,5.1913875598086126
2903453,1,B000TJBNEO,"The Species series once again hits the direct to DVD market with Species IV: The Awakening, this time featuring uber-hottie Helena Mattsson as the sexy alien/human hybrid on the hunt for a mate, and leaves a bloody path of destruction in her path.  Anyone who remembers when the Species series debuted will recall how much of an enjoyable guilty pleasure the first film was, which followed with a sub-par sequel.  Species III would be the first of the series to direct to DVD, and was absolutely horrible, but Species IV takes the cake.  It just seems here that no imagination at all was put into the film, and the film's formula of sexy alien killer isn't just tired at this point, it's just plain boring, which also sums up the whole movie.  Mattsson is incredibly gorgeous, and it's good to see genre veteran Ben Cross here (he's the only actor here who actually seems to know what he's doing; big shock there), but nothing can make up for the yawn fest that develops once the film starts.  Avoid.",1196467200,,1000,4.595505617977528
2903454,1,B000TJBNEO,"I've been a fan of Science Fiction for almost as long as I've been alive. It was my mother who got me started all those years ago with the original Star Trek series, and to this day, despite that I've grown to enjoy many other genre's, I still am a fan of science Fiction, and I will be until the day I pass on to the next life.

Also, due to a series of genetic defects that runs rampant in my bloodline, which fortunately for myself and my son, doesn't affect either of us,  I've been quite interested in genetics and the human genome.

To top it off, for decades, SETI (the search for extraterrestrial intelligence) has been searching the skies for signs of non-human intelligence.

Back in 1995, a science fiction film starring a newcomer named Natasha Henstridge, and co-starring a list of popular actors (Ben Kingsley, Forrest Whitaker, Michael Madsen and Alfred Molina) hit the silver screen.

This film was called Species and put all three of these topics together in a sexy, scary, well crafted tale of the potential end of humanity as the dominant species on Earth.

To make things better, the legendary H. R. Geiger (who created the xenomorph that has become part of our popular culture, the original Alien), was contracted to create the alien hybrid of this movie, Sil.

The movie has since spawned three additional sequels, each getting worse and worse as the storyline progresses and this review is about the latest entry into the franchise called Species: The Awakening.

In one aspect, it's sort of a morality fable, about keeping secrets from those close to you, and that messing with things best left alone always has dire consequences.

But when it comes right down to it, this movie was simply a money grab from the studios.

Sadly, it barely fits the bill of science fiction, secondly, the whole genetic aspect was a joke, and finally - I don't think SETI was even mentioned in the movie.

To be sure, the main actress Helena Mattson was exceptionally attractive, although her acting skills left a great deal to be desired. Still, I've seen worse - from several of the supporting actor in the movie itself.

The movie, hell, the franchise sells itself on sex. Beautiful women, running around naked, trying to seduce men so that they can procreate and start an invasion of the planet.

That just doesn't cut it.

Most people, myself included, need a good plot and halfway decent acting, with some neat effects thrown in for good measure.

Ok the movie had some cool effects, as the alien hybrids were very well done, but the plot was, for the most part, non existent.

And what little plot there was had holes the size of our solar system. I mean, come on, using a combination of alien DNA to clone dead pets and loved ones for money?  Alien hybrids running loose in a town in Mexico?

It was quite the joke, even if the writers did attempt to explain things by saying that the hybrid creations were sterile. And then only to have the main hybrid, Miranda, who had to take the genetic material from another woman to survive, suddenly `awaken' and become this alien monster who is now fertile and ready to being the invasion.

The slaughter of many innocent people was toned down, which is a good thing. I've never been a fan of gore for the sake of gore, and even the nudity was lacking compared to the other movies.

If the movie had one thing going for it, it was the effects. But, as many people know, good effects don't make for a good movie. And even now the effects were pretty blas compared to major Hollywood productions. What do you expect for a direct to video shoe string movie though?

Not much, that's for damned sure.

Do yourself a favour, take my review for what it's worth. Don't waste your time on this movie unless you can see it for free, or can pick it up for cheap at your local rental store. Save your money for a real movie, or if you need to see the any of this franchise, rent or buy the original movie and watch it over again.

8209786,3,B000TJBNEO,"After seeing the first three Species movies for the first time recently I came across a box set called 'Species - The Complete Evolution' and grabbed as it included the hard to find fourth movie 'Species: The Awakening'.

 This fourth Species film is in my opinion a fair bit better than the horrendous reviews it has. I'm quite partial to the whole Species premise and really enjoyed the first three but this one is meant to be a stand alone movie separate from the first three and perhaps not coincidentally is the only one without Natasha Henstridge in it at all.

 Helena Mattsson does in my opinion a pretty good job in this which is more drama driven and features her and her 'uncle' Ben Cross quite heavily. I think it's well acted by both so not much of a problem and despite the low budget and one early cringeworthy CGI scene when action does happen in this it's done well and effectively.

 To be fair the plot isn't worth bothering with and Dominic Keating does a very bad impersonation of an Aussie or whatever it is he's doing other than chewing the scenery but hey I enjoyed the movie.",1463702400,3,1100,4.475
