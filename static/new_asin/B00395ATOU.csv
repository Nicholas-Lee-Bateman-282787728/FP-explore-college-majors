8391968,3,B00395ATOU,"Be mindful of the fact that this DVD is for region 2 viewing. The US is a different region, which means that if you don't have a region free DVD player, you will not be able to see the movie on this DVD. The up side to buying DVD's of different regions is that they are generally cheaper. You can get one of these special DVD players from amazon for about $70.00.",1485993600,,363,4.055555555555555
