A medieval French Nobleman is transported to the  future with his servant.  As stupid as this premise sounds, we really got  caught up in the characters and how they react.  We liked hearing it in  French while reading the English subtitles.  It makes it more believable.  Jean Reno, who is also in ""Godzilla"" with Matthew Broderick, is a  very good actor and we liked watching him.  Actually, all the characters  were cast perfectly.  This movie is worth buying.",947376000,7,636,4.612612612612613
1193277,5,B000006F1T,"""Les Visiteurs"" (1993).
I saw this film in letterbox format on Showtime Cable in June 1999. (The title sequences on the NTSC/VHS version are letterbox, but the bulk of the film is panned and scanned.) I must have tuned in 10 or 15 minutes after the opening. It is the funniest film I have  ever seen. I had to consider whether this could actually be true, because I  laughed so hard that I could not always read the subtitles due to my  tears!
What I like about this film is its playful absurdity. (I never  liked the ""screwball comedy"" genre until this film.) The writers  and actors seem to have an excellent sense of history, modern as well as  medieval and of human nature. The premise is unbelievable, but is presented  early in the film. The humanity, in particular the willingness of the  characters to learn, to try new things and new language, is very naturally  presented. This is what makes the film work. I am reminded of Peter Sellers  in his 1979 film ""Being There"". An unbelievable premise made  believable and entertaining by the naturalness of the characters in an  unnatural context.
This film has profanity and violence which may be  inappropriate for younger audiences. It contains medieval French which may  produce interesting side effects for students of French who use this film  as a motivational study aid!
I understand that a French language only  version is available for U.S. (NTSC) players and that the 1996 sequel  ""Les Visiteurs 2"" is also available, without subtitles.
I also  understand that the original cast will remake the film in 2000 entirely in  English. Somehow, despite my absent French, I cannot imagine how this film  could be improved upon. We will see.",943660800,22,1698,4.789655172413793

1193291,5,B000006F1T,"Hello I'm an autistic adult.

This is my review on The Visitor's.

I love mideval movies & once again was flipping through the channels on the tv & came across this on the french version movie I soon figured out it was the original. I loved it. I have it on the DVR & watch it almost every day.  This movie is so funny these two guys get sent to future from the mideval times era & there just so lost they figure out they have a decendant in the future & I'm not going to tell any more your just have to going to watch the movie.  The american version which is good but left alot of stuff out which in my opinion is really sad. But both movies are extremely good.

Watch the movie it's really funny & good for all ages.

1193292,4,B000006F1T,".... But I loved it! I happened upon it on TV on an HD Movie channel. I was about to switch channels - I don't like French, don't like sub-titles - but something caught my attention, and I started watching ""just a few minutes"" of it. Then, I realized, ""Hey, this is funny!"". I had to watch the remainder of it, but had missed the beginning. So, I had to buy the DVD.

With the sub-titles, you have to pay attention, and it may not be everyone's style of humor, but I laughed my way through it!",1246406400,2,493,4.082474226804123
1193293,5,B000006F1T,"Hilarious, wonderful and full of original situations!

I watched it many years ago with my now 19 year old, who was like seven back then. It was in French with subtitles and even then we enjoyed it very much.

It is a kind of comedy we had never seen before so we thought it was fresh, original and frankly, very bold and funny.

Since then, there has been a new version, with C. Applegate happening in America. It is basically the same thing, but they introduce other characters, and it is a great movie too.

So, if you want more for your money, this one is certainly cheaper. But get it because you know you'll enjoy it very much and will love watching it again and again; at least, that's my reason to buy movies.",1236124800,2,717,4.288888888888889
1193294,5,B000006F1T,"The acting, and writing, is superb.  The more you watch this film, the better it gets...you can really appreciate the many subtleties.  Jean Reno really has the aristocracy of the time completely channeled.  Clavier, as the vassal, reminds us that there was a time when only the rich or titled had much of a life.  Everyone else was just expendable or unworthy...as shown deftly by Clavier's character becoming a pile of s*** when going back in time.  The ending is quite amazing and surprising and it makes you think...oh...so that's why it is possible for a vassal's offspring to eventually become the owner of the castle!  1,000 years later. But I don't want to ruin the ending.  You can appreciate why one wanted to return to his time and the other didn't.  The only thing I couldn't figure out was the reference to ""I'm a helicopter man"".  Why is that so amusing to the French?  This movie is delightful and different.",1225929600,,923,4.6770186335403725

When I finally did receive it and put it in the player to watch it, I realized that it was in french. No where on the cover or on the site in Amazon was it noted that it was filmed in french with SOME subtitles. I was very disappointed and it was too late to return it since I had already opened the seal. I had expected for Amazon to at least mention that slight detail for it's consumers before they make their purchase.

1193299,4,B000006F1T,"I admit I haven't seen more than probably 40 or 50 ""foreign"" films, but of those, this is still the funniest one I have watched. The major problem I had with it was that the dialog (and the humorous lines) came so fast I barely had time to read the subtitles. It gets a little tiring after awhile trying to keep up with the reading and viewing at the same time, at that pace.

As with all comedies, you get both smart and stupid scenes. You get more stupid when you have more slapstick, but you also have more laugh-out-loud moments. Such is the case here, as Jean Reno and Christian Clavier portray clownish 11th-century men who suddenly find themselves in modern-day France. Time-travel films almost always are fascinating, whether it's sci-fi or comedy.

As for family viewing, there is no sex and no nudity, but there is rough language which is why it's rated ""R.""",1189296000,,868,4.5576923076923075
1193300,4,B000006F1T,"If you enjoy Monty Python or physical humor you should enjoy this movie. There certainly is intellectual humor as well but with a little less gusto. Fans of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" should definitely catch it. Jean Reno is great as a Count that accidentally kills his father-in-law to be after a witch puts a spell on him. He must then call on his wizard to set things right. The wizard can't bring the man back to life so he sends Reno and his squire through time. The problem is they go the wrong way and end up in current time. They find themseles having a Don Quixote experience, but fighting automobiles, a chef, and the police instead. After being shipped off to the looney bin a distant descendant starts to believe in him and comes to his rescue.

This movie only comes with English subtitles and not dubbing. That is probably just as well since I have heard some terrible dubbing in other Jean Reno films. I highly recommend this comedy for some good laughs. If I have any complaint it is that you will enjoy it more if you speak French. My step daughter does and got more out of it since she pointed out there is some changes in the English subtitles to tame it down. Still enjoyable, but as one astute reviewer pointed out they need to use the same subtitles they used on the VHS. If you aren't big on foreign movies you may want to catch ""Just Visiting"" with Jean Reno and Christina Applegate instead. Basicly an Americanized version of the same story. The style is similar to the ""Pink Panther"" comedies.",1187049600,2,1526,4.45

1193302,3,B000006F1T,"OK, OK, it's a French movie with subtitles. But it's really very funny. Knight & lackey get wizarded to the present, both meet their descendants. Of course, no one believes they are who they say they are. Medieval customs and morals values confront modern French customs and moral values. Hilarity ensues.

Some of the costumes, armor, etc, are off by about 300 years, but the movie's a lark, so who cares.",1168473600,4,406,4.71830985915493
1193303,4,B000006F1T,"This is one of Jean Reno's best performance to date.  Nobody take themselves seriously in this movie.  Yes, it's one of those time-travel genre, of a knight who yearns to do go to the past to remedy a minor glitch that prevents him from marrying his betrothed bride and thus, doomship for his family line.  Due to forgetfulness of the Merlin, he forgets to add in one crucial ingredient.  Instead of going back to the past, the knight and his servant are transported 1,000 years later to the future, where he gets to see his descendants.  When he's there, he's endeavouring to find a way to go home.  Doesn't that remind you of Back to the Future trilogy?  Anyhow, this movie absolutely hillarious with slapstick gags about the medieval people having to get themselves adjusted to the modern way of living, and also those cheeky dialogues which meant more to the French than to those like me that have to depend on the subtitles to understand the movie.  Few years later, another version is made of this movie with pretty much the same cast.  I shall endeavour to watch that one too to give readers a more constructive understanding of this movie offering.  Being a 1993 movie, we don't expect to find much extras or any at all in this instance.  Sound quality and digital remastering are not available.  Very video-like quality.

The one thing I will say that bothered me was not the film itself but the difference in the subtitling between the original VHS issue, in French, and the subsequent American released DVD.---I guess having owned the VHS and seen it COUNTLESS times (it's that funny-but wore out now) when the DVD was issued I just about jumped out of my pants!  Then came the 1st viewing.  Not even 10 mins. into the film I noticed little nuance's with the DVD translation that were different from the VHS.--- This was a little disappointing but only because of my familiarity with the tape.
For example: On VHS, in the one scene, right after the Jean Reno was given the witches potion, he says something to the effect of, ""Holy Scrotums!  The Castle swelleth like a [...]!""--On the DVD (which I'm sorry, I can't remember as well) he said something far more tamer, which is where it lost, to only a minor degree, some of it humorous pazazz and charm!
I sure wish they had-had the same translators when they did the DVD cause the VHS translation was much funnier.  Other than this minor little quibble, ""The Visitors"" is one of the funniest and most touching films I've ever seen.  Jean Reno is the best!!

Filled with quirky characters playing opposite a bunch who play it straight, this excellent cast deliver non-stop fun in an intelligent, if occasionally slapstick, venture into alternate realities. I agree with comments that there could and should have been more special features on the DVD, and it would be useful for many if there were an English dub track but one very quickly gets used to the subtitling, even though it isn't -- er -- exactly what's being said on the screen.

1193310,4,B000006F1T,"you American people writting reviews on Amazon just rock my world !!!

I was very glad and shall I admit, surprised to see so many great reviews of this film that is a total French modern classic. I never thought that this kind of very French and sometimes perhaps not so subtle humour would cross over well to the States. Apparently it does, it's true that after American Pie and such, who could cast the first stone to blame the not so subtle jokes... ;o)

 anyway, don't feel offended.

So this film is a classic in France, I saw it for the first time when I was 7 or 8 and it was just one of my favourites, the dialogues were all over the playground and lines : ""c'est OKKKKKKK!"" and ""mais qu'est ce que c'est que ce bins ?!"" as well as the now famous light joke ""jour. nuit."" and the crazy ""mais Monsieur Ouille, pas avec votre poncho !!!"" are still ringing a bell for any French person who hasn't lived as an hermit for the last 15 years.

 This film comes from a long and prolific tradition of French comedies starting in the late 70's with the Bande du Splendid, a group of actors and comics working together and eventually making it extremely big in France. Their all time classic, possibly the single most famous French film ever (at least in France) ""Santa Close is a bastard"" (I don't know the official american title for ""le pre Nol est une ordure""). This film was a play before (if you ask me better than the film) and is completely zany and very rude, crude, politically incorrect and simply hillarious. If your francophilia or curiousity asks for something to watch with friends, try to find the film. It's just CULT in France, every Christmas you see it on TV (better than the Wizard of Oz ;o)

 To go with Les Visiteurs and Le pre Nol, I also recommand Les Bronzs (the suntanned ??) especially the sequel Les Bronzs font du ski (even better than the original). With the same actors (Clavier, Lhermitte, Chazel, Jugniot...)that traces the 'adventures' of a group of middle class friends, first on some touristic island ressort and then skying in the Alpes. These films are extremely funny and are classics as well.

 If you appreciate Thierry Lhermitte (who was reaaaally cute in his time) you may want to check out the more recent Le Placard (the closet) and Dinner Game, in which he excels as usual. These comedies are in the same tradition even though slightly more elaborate.

 As many have underlined, language is very important in French films, even if slapstick is also a great favorite, therefore everything might not come through subtitles, but these films are so funny that the subtitles cannot completely kill that.

 The very best French comedy of the last years was Asterix and Obelix Mission Cleopatra,it is extremely referential in its humour so I don't really know how much is understandable by a foreign audience who knows nothing about Canal + and its particular humour, however it is really untertaining and very glossy/fancy (very expansive for a French film) so check it out if you feel down, the allusions to American culture are plenty and friendly. (yes, guess what: the French are not American haters, they just have a critical mind and hate Freedom fries ;op )

 I put 4 * and not 5 because as a cinephile I consider that Les Visiteurs is not quality quality; but that's just because I am elitist. In terms of cheer entertainment and laughs it is worth 5*.",1111536000,20,3399,4.584158415841584
1193311,4,B000006F1T,"This is supposedly the highest grossing French movie of all time. I believe it. This movie is well-acted and supurbly scripted.

Jean Reno stars as the civilized brute, Godefroy le Hardi, living in the 1100s with his vassal, Jacquouille la Fripouille, played by Christian Clavier. Godefroy wishes to return to the past to correct a grave error, but the very old, possible senile, wizard omits the ""oeufs de caille"" from the recipe and Godefroy and Jacquouille find themselves in the future.

Godefroy finds his ""petite-petite-petite-petite fille"" Batrice de Montmirail, played superbly by Valerie Lemercier, who has modern French aristocratic tics down pat. He is disgusted to find that his Chateau is now a hotel in the hands of a nouveau-riche commoner, Jacquard also played by Clavier. Without telling the whole story, Godefroy is, of course, trying to get back to the past to be with his beloved Dame Frenegonde, also played by Lemercier.

The acting in this movie is fantastic, the main characters, Reno, Clavier, Lemercier and Marie-Anne Chazal are all very funny. The supporting cast is just as good, with the beautiful Isabelle Nanty playing a gossipy, litiginous executive assistant and Christian Bujeau as Batrice de Montmirail's high-strung, dentist husband.

There is a lot of word play between the medieval French spoken by Godefroy and Jacquouille and modern French. The English sub-titles leave quite a bit to be desired, as they don't do a very good job conveying this. If you don't speak French you may find that this movie relies heavily on sight gags because the complex language jokes are lost in translation. However, I have watched this with non-French speaking friends before and they have still enjoyed the movie very much. If you speak French you will enjoy this movie tremendously. I am a fluent speaker and it has taken me several watchings to get all the subtleties of language in this movie. I laugh out loud each time I watch it.  It remains to this day, 10 years after I first saw it in the theater and countless movies later, one of my all-time favorites!

I give this edition of the movie a 4 out of 5 for a few reasons, none related to the movie itself, but still minor annoyances that detract from the film. For example, you cannot turn off the subtitles as far as I can tell. Additionally, the English subtitles aren't entirely faithful to what is said on screen. This doesn't detract from the film but it is still obnoxious, there are no bonus materials at all with this DVD.

Despite these minor things I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, accessible French comedy, especially if you are a fan of Reno or Clavier.",1100649600,43,2667,4.848351648351648
1193312,2,B000006F1T,"The original movie ""Les Visiteurs"" is so good, its a pity they had to spoil with the Americanized version - ""Just Visiting"" - which is at best an insult on the intelligence of the American viewing public.
Although the original movie is in French with English subtitles, they have done a tremendous job with the subtitles - translating a kind of ""medieval"" French into a comparable type of old English (modern swearwords included).  In fact, the job is done so well that we had a lot of laughs just by comparing the film's verbal antics to the translation.  Even though I do not speak French myself, it is quite clear that a lot of effort had gone into this.  Sometimes the conversations are fast and furious, so it's worthwhile to see the movie a second time.  Even on the second pass, there was a lot to laugh at.
The original was meant to be slapstick and the story is a total farce, but I thought it was well done, and very well executed.  Even though this whole thing is intended as a joke, the reactions of the medieval guys are quite believable.  Both versions star Jean Reno and Christian Clavier, but unfortunately that is not enough to save ""Just Visiting"", which I can at best award two stars.  In contrast, the original effort is a blast and worth at least 4 stars.
If you can, try to obtain the French version.  It's worth the trouble!",1087430400,6,1347,4.469387755102041
1193313,5,B000006F1T,"I watched this video in Fench with Eglish sub titles in my french class.
It is a very funny movie about 1 midevil knight and his servant.  They go forward in time on accident when they drink a potion that is supposed to make the knight able to change the corse of an aarow that kills his belovede's father.  His love won't marry him then and all he ever wanted was to have a family and decendents.
Once they show up in the present day, everyone thinks the kningt is the long lost cousin of this one girl, who is really the knigt's decendant.
It is hallarious the way the midevil knight and servant react to modern things.  They don't realize what time they are in.
This movie has a twist and a problem at the end, which I guess is fixed in the second movie.  We are in the middle of watching it (it is Les Visiteurs 2 I think), but it's no as easy to understand for me because there are not English subtitles in the version we are watching.
The only reason this movie is rated R is because there is a lot of bad words.  In France (where it is origionally from), i think it was only rated PG, but i'm not that sure, so don't take my word for it.
Have a fun time watching Les Visiteurs!!!!!!!",1052006400,6,1190,4.112068965517241
1193314,5,B000006F1T,"Well, for quite awhile, this DVD was not available in the US, and even hard to find in its native France. It was a nice surprise to finally see it appear stateside, and hopefully, it's appearance will garner some more attention to French comedies. The story focuses around a nobleman who, along with his oafish servent, is transported forward in time to modern day France. In their new surroundings, they must deal with life in the modern world, as well as try to figure out how to return to their own time. Christian Clavier and Jean Reno do outstanding jobs as the misplaced main characters, and the movie moves at such a pace, that it offers plenty of laughs.

1193316,5,B000006F1T,"This movie (or, film, for you students of pretense) is a pleasant blend of history, satire, and fiction.  Contrary to the opinons expressed in one of the previous reviews, I believe that Valerie Lemercier, as Frenegonde, is FAR superior to Christina Applegate.  Ms. Applegate was beautiful as Kelley Bundy, but seems to lack the range and tongue-in-cheek humor of Ms. Lemercier. Marie-Anne Chazel (close friend of Christian Clavier) is great in her role as the bag lady who discovers the serf of her dreams.  Jean Reno expertly plays the proud but confused knight, and demonstrates a flair for humor I had not previously seen - watch the scene where he tries to discover the purpose of a toilet, or where he takes a dignified bath enhanced by a half-gallon of Chanel No. 5.
  I was a left a bit cold by M. Clavier's broad slapstick humor, but this was my only complaint.  Les Visiteurs is, and will remain, one of my all-time favorite movies.",1036713600,6,942,4.713414634146342

I just saw on cable the film ""Just Visiting"", the english remake of this French version, I got many laughs out of the film and Christina Applegate is always easy on the eyes.  So I wanted to see the original.
The Visitors, is a good movie, no doubt about it, but, I prefered the english remake.  The DVD is very limited without any real extra features.  Great for french students, because you can turn off the english subtitles.  I don't regret the purchase but, it seems a bit pricey for what you get.",1019433600,,619,4.3478260869565215
1193324,2,B000006F1T,"Comedy is a notoriously xenophobic traveller - happiest at home; always moaning about the people and conveniences abroad.  So whereas a squire and his vassal can cross a millenium in time, the jokes and broad humour stay stubbornly rooted in France, leaving foreigners bemused at how 'The Visitors' so tickles the national funny bone.  I guess it's the same with the 'Carry On' films: hilarious for us (in the British Isles), meaningless to everyone else.  It's not just a case of knowing about French history or culture, but about being attuned to a particular comic tradition and its modes (in this case Parisian street theatre and cafe comedy) - if you don't understand them, how are you going to laugh at them?
'The Visitors' is basically a Gallic variation on the old Rip Van Winkle yarn, with a character transplanted from his age, attitudes and manners, and plonked into our own.  Seen through an alien's eyes, the everyday world we take for granted becomes fresh and arguably ridiculous.  The fact that this alien is a relative, one of 'us', makes the gap between his age and ours more pointed.  So although the medieval realm Jean Reno's knight bestrides is muddy, violent, war-mongering, and socially unjust, it allows for a nobility, honesty, friendship and bravery that has no place in our world.  When Reno in 1993 takes a bath in his underclothes, dumping thousands of francs worth of salts and ointments, it is we who look silly, not him, with our pointless waste, and obsessive preference for clean bodies over clean souls.  Our world may be more democratic, the peasants may be allowed take over the castle, the French Revolution may have smashed the ancien regime, but a rigid social structure remains in place, there is still a hierarchy of social dependence in which some people get to give orders and others have to take them.
'Visitors' makes a case for the continuity of history, the presence of the past in a present that would deny or break away from it - the hidden dungeon in the converted hotel is a kind of unconscious suppressed by the national ego.  Typically, women are at the root of social disruption - it is a witch who causes Reno and Clavier to be hurtled through time; it is the tramp Lady Ginette who encourages Clavier to overturn his social position.  Medieval military violence translates into modern police brutality.
The most disappointing thing about 'Visitors' is the simplistic level of the comic material, the repeated resort to the obvious.  There is none of the clash of or inventive delight in linguistic registers you find in Raymond Queneau's 'The Blue Flowers', another story about a medieval knight rampaging through history towards the present.  It's a real shame, because the actors are delightful - Reno's mud-spattered aristocracy never becomes foolish; Clavier in a double role alternates gross-out earthiness with an absurd sophistication; Valerie Lemercier is the uptight snob who learns to see new possibilities; and Christian Bujeau as her exasperated husband is a rare example of the straight man getting all the laughs.",1016582400,3,3085,4.957364341085271
1193325,5,B000006F1T,"A very funny French comedy, this movie, and its sequel, was a huge hit in France.
A medieval knight (Jean Reno, of ""The Professional"" and ""Godzilla"" fame) and his servant (Christian Clavier, a famous French comic actor, unknown abroad) got magically transported forward in time to the XXth century, where he meets his descendants - and tries to adjust to our modern world, from the mysteries of running water and flushing toilets, to those of modern women and the free pursuit of life and happiness for all. The pace never slacks, the movie offers a series of sight gags, as well as a number of more tongue-in-cheek and even (gasp) intellectual jokes and double-entendres -along w/ some ""profound"" reflexions slickly intertwined w/in the storyline. The movie can be approached at several levels, from the basic visceral to the high-fallutin', and has appeal to different audiences - and viewers' moods. The language is precious (difference between old French and modern French) but there's enough situational and sight humour in there that even non-French speakers should find the movie enjoyable.
The U.S. remake, albeit with the same main actors, was not quite on a par, as seems to be too often the case. I felt it favored the slapstick, and neglected the more subtle undertones that the original managed to carry as well.
If I have to pick a nit, it would be that that the DVD doesn't offer more Special features <grumble grumble> - but the movie is well-worth the purchase (or rental :-) anyway. Pick a bottle of wine and some good cheese, and make an evening of it!",1015804800,70,1571,4.843866171003717
1193326,5,B000006F1T,"This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It is I think quite different from US movies in that the comedy does not come from a witty script but from slapstick and absurd situations executed with real flair. The actors are marvellous, Jean Reno in my opinion taking second prize to Christian Clavier who plays both his roles with jaw-dropping skill. There is so much comic detail in this film that it works best second time. And this is a great family film: the nippers will be as delighted as I trust you will be. A treasure.

Christian Clavier is wonderful in dual roles as a peasant and a hotelier.  Valerie Lemercier is brilliant in her modern day role coming from old money.  Nothing the eccentrics did phased her: the smells, the behaviorisms, the disasters.

1193331,4,B000006F1T,"Last year, the 1993 French film ""Les Visiteurs"" was remade for American audiences. ""Just Visiting"" retained its principal French actors, Jean Reno and Christian Clavier, and added the unremarkable TV actress Christine Applegate. I didn't see it on principle because remaking French films is as bad an idea as turning movies into Broadway shows.
The premise of the film is simple. A medieval nobleman (Reno) and his squire (Clavier) take a bad potion and are sent into the future. Before they can get back home, Comte Godefroy de Montmirail and his squire Jacquart have to adapt to modern day France. These scenes are pure candy. Just about anything Christian Clavier does produces intense laughter, whether he is eating a sandwich with the plastic wrap, making animal noises into a telephone, or scrambling on the floor for left-over potato scraps. Better still is watching Reno and Clavier attempt to master modern bathing. This is good, old-fashioned slapstick humor, and it works without insulting your intelligence. In the end, the plot of ""Les Visiteurs"" is incidental as the supporting characters. It involves some younglings and a search for a dungeon. There are some special effects, burning rings, lightening and such. But this film is the sum of its jokes and even upon second viewing the jokes provided enormous delight",1011916800,4,1330,5.1336405529953915
