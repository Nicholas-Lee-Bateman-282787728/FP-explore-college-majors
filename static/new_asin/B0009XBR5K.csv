A simple drawing of the story is on the right and the text is on the left (looks like an old book) and as each word is read out-loud its color changes from gray too black. This helps readers follow along, while non-readers can enjoy the image provided. Different voices represent the different characters which helps kids realize someone else is talking. Between stories actual children are showed commenting on the stories lesson (actually within the story they do this too and the kids comment on what they hope will happen, or what a character is doing). The children also tell fun & silly jokes.

No bells and whistles here, so it will be boring to kids spoiled by overly stylized/animated DVDs. That said, kids you are used to being read to will find the videos interesting and enjoyable.

My kiddo at first was not interested, but after a few times she stopped to watch and realized it was just like story time, but on the television. She also enjoys reading along with the words.

These DVD's are a healthier alternative to cartoons. I mean it really is a show dedicated to reading books. I wish there where more DVD's like this, they reinforce the importance of reading to kids.

Included is a CD with all the stories found on the DVD. This is great for car trips or as an alternative to putting the tv on for parents who just want to avoid it all together. My kiddo loves both teh DVD and CD.",1373760000,,1500,4.523985239852398
