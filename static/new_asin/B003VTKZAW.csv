8407092,5,B003VTKZAW,"A lovely momento of Wimbledon 2010.

A really good doccumentary style film showing the players journeys through the rounds and the finals as well as other historic happenings such as the longest ever match and the Queens visit.

I'm a Rafael Nadal fan & I buy almost everything with him in it but I like tennis in general & this is a really good film and Rafa won the final so I (and many other fans) was really pleased!

Rafa fans will love this book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poetry-of-Passion-for-People-with-a-Pulse/dp/0956526608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poetry of Passion (for People with a Pulse)</a>&nbsp;it's got 80 poems in about how us fans feel about him, the highs the lows and his lovely humble personality and his sexy looks, and the other poems about love are good too.",1298419200,2,843,5.51937984496124
8407093,5,B003VTKZAW,"2010 was the year it all happened at Wimbledon:

The longest ever tennis match in history between John Isner & Nicholas Mahut which was a 5 setter over about 3 days & ended with a score of 70 games to 68 in the 5th set!!

The Queen attended the Championships for the 1st time in 33 years & met past Champions & players.

Rafael Nadal fans were treated to a 2nd Wimbledon win by their hero, although not really a classic final as he beat Berdych in straight sets it was a perfect end to Wimbledon 2010 for Rafa's many fans.

If you're a Tennis Fan this is a great Souvenir, it's a well put together film that all tennis fans will enjoy & includes bits from many of the matches in both the ladies & mens.

Rafa fans will also love the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poetry-of-Passion-for-People-with-a-Pulse/dp/0956526608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poetry of Passion (for People with a Pulse)</a>&nbsp;as it has a long chapter called ""A Fan's Feelings"" of 80 poems about Rafa, his career, his personality & his good looks (& the rest of the book is brilliant too) No Rafa fan should be without it!",1298419200,,1152,4.948186528497409
