7828240,5,6302636108,LOVE THIS VIDEO CAUSE HULK HOGAN WAS AND STILL IS MY FAVORITE WRESTLE SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY.,1427068800,,95,4.052631578947368
7828241,4,6302636108,"First off, if someone wants to cover Hogan's best matches it would take a four video set.  For a single video this is not bad, I do not agree with all the match choices, but this is a pretty good video.  I would suggest this to any youngsters who only know the ""Hollywood Hogan""  character.  This video shows how I and all the other Hulkamanics think of  the Hulkster...",947894400,2,370,4.304347826086956
7828242,1,6302636108,"Shows nothing of old school matches when Hulk was a heel in the WWF when he used to wrestle Backlund, Tony Garea, etc. The WWF practices revionist history. This video is awful! See E! channel for a real Hogan story.
How  bout a video documenting the WWF in the 1970's when wrestling was so much  better.",945820800,2,303,4.392857142857143
7828243,3,6302636108,"Good video, I am a big fan of Hogan since the very beginning, unfortunatly I think the video could have included some more fights against more exciting opponents like the Macho Man, The Undertaker etc...but if you are  a big fan you've probably seen them all but what about people who might  want to learn about the Hulkster! Please could someone produce a video  covering his whole career.",945129600,3,390,4.705882352941177
7828244,3,6302636108,"This is a tape that reviews Hulk Hogan in the wrestling ring in 1990-1992.  He takes on fellow WWF superstars such as Mr. Perfect, Ted Dibiase, and others.  Also in an exclusive tag team match, then WWF Champion-Hulk Hogan  and then WWF Intercontinental Champion-Rowdy Roddy Piper take on Ric Flair  and Sid Justice.  If you watch both WWF and WCW these days, you'll find the  tag team match both interesting and entertaining.  Since this video was  released in 1992, it is not quite a top priority in any wrestling fans want  list.  But, if you are a loyal Hulk Hogan fan, it is a must have for your  wrestling video collection.",932342400,,629,4.576576576576577
