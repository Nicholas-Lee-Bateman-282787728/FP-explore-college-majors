4231007,5,B003YLM77G,This movie captured both of my kids' attention the entire film. It was the perfect length for even my 3 year old.  I could hear giggles from the TV room the entire movie and there was nothing scary in the entire film- which was refreshing!  I highly suggest this video as an addition to your collection.  I plan to play this one in the car this holiday season as well when visiting friends and family!,1258848000,,401,4.32
4231008,5,B003YLM77G,"I've got a 3 year old, and a 5 year old who are both huge Curious George fans.  They loved this movie immediately.  I think it is a little cheesy (especially some of the songs), and I was expecting a full-length movie (it is 58 minutes long). However, both of the kids seem to think it is fantastic, and since I bought it for them, I have given it 5 stars.",1258156800,,356,4.0
4231009,5,B003YLM77G,"Like the PBS show, it has the regular characters we have grown to love, with their respective voices.  When The Man w/the Yellow Hat wants to help George write out his Christmas list, George presents him his list in the form of a drawing of shapes (circles, squares,triangles...).  The Man w/the Yellow Hat labors over the list and can't figure out what George wants for Christmas.  The Man w/the Yellow Hat sees how well the Doorman and Hundley work together and how Chef Pisghetti understands Gnocchi.  The Man w/the Yellow Hat feels he doesn't really understand George, isn't a good monkey parent, and that maybe George would be better off with someone else.  The Man w/the Yellow Hat dreams of the Ghost of Time Gone Sideways.  He sees what it would be like if George was with the Doorman, Professor Wiseman, or Chef Pisghetti, instead of him.  During the dream The Man w/the Yellow Hat figures out what George's list means and what he wants for Christmas.

During this time, George is trying to decide on the perfect gift to make for The Man w/the Yellow Hat.  George's creations end in messes and disappointment until he figures out exactly what to give The Man w/the Yellow Hat.",1257897600,29,1185,4.685990338164252

4231156,1,B003YLM77G,"In 'A Very Monkey Christmas' George and the Man in the Yellow Hat prepare for Christmas while trying the find the perfect gifts for each other.  It's a pretty standard, by which I mean mediocre, but brought down further by a shockingly tone deaf message.

This DVD started off on a sour note with a half dozen ads for other videos, most of which were based on toys.  the movie is then followed by ads for the corporate sponsors.  I dislike ads on DVDs in general, I already paid for this movie after all, but I really don't like it when my young daughters are exposed to more ads than necessary.  Poor form PBS.

The movie itself well it's so mediocre, so without redeeming features even my 2 year olds got up and walked away after 10 minutes.  The songs are forgettable, the story is pretty standard and the jokes fall flat.  And as little as there was to entertain my toddlers there's even less for parents.

i was also irked to see George and the Man (naturally) celebrate a TV-safe version of Christmas with no Nativity scenes or visits to church.  At least they actually mention Christmas rather than generic 'Holidays'.

But it's the final message that drives this story from a forgettable diversion to outright bad.

SPOILERS - the Man in the Yellow Hat finally figures out what George's note means, he wants EVERYTHING in the toy store window and the Man has to buy it ALL or Christmas is ruined.

I checked and was surprised Toys R Us is not one of the sponsors.

Now once I might have been inclined to give this two or three stars but let's face time and money are limited, and there's plenty of Christmas specials out there.  Do not waste your limited time or money on this one.",1418515200,2,1689,4.438311688311688

4231167,2,B003YLM77G,"We are big Curious George fans here, but I can't give this movie an enthusiastic recommendation. It isn't horrible, but there are much better Christmas movies out there. At its root, I feel it is too much about presents. Throughout the movie, the Man with the Yellow Hat [MYH] tries to find the right gift for George. George makes a list, but the MYH can't understand it as it looks like a bunch of random shapes. The MYH becomes very dispirited and thinks that if he can't understand what George wants for Christmas, maybe he isn't the right caretaker (owner? father? friend?) for George. At the last minute, the MYH has a mental breakthrough and realizes [SPOILER!] that George's Christmas list drawing depicts an entire toy store display window. He wants everything in the window. Yay! The MYH now understands and rushes to fulfill the little monkey's every desire, arriving at the toy store just minutes before it closes on Christmas Eve. George's Christmas is saved! All told, it is only five toys, so it isn't ridiculous, but I found this ending very disappointing. It teaches that a happy Christmas depends on getting every toy on our Christmas lists.

The parallel story line, however, is sweet. The MYH asks George to surprise him with a gift. George has a hard time, hoping for a flying car or other things that don't exist, but he finally ends up making a present -- a series of drawings showing all the fun Christmas things he and the MYH did, like picking out and decorating a tree, doing a Christmas show, eating special Christmas foods, etc. ""We sure had a lot of fun this month,"" the MYH says, looking over the pictorial Christmas record that George made. This part of the movie I really like. But I think the presents that the MYH buys for George overshadow this sweeter gift.

I like a lot of things about the PBS series, and as this Christmas movie is part of those newer George stories, it does have some good parts. We get to see Bill out in the country (who is selling Christmas trees in a very ""Bill"" manner), Professor Wiseman, and Hundley, for example. Unfortunately most of the movie takes place in the city and we don't see the Quints or Allie or other favorite characters from the country house. A highlight is Steve, who helps Besty write a new Christmas carol as a gift for Aunt Margaret. As usual, Steve is very funny. My favorite of his efforts, to the tune of We Wish You a Merry Christmas: ""Do fish know that it is Christmas, Do fish know that it is Christmas, Do fish know that it is Christmas or are they confused?"" Sadly, Betsy doesn't take Steve's advice and ends up singing a horrid song about ""Christmas Monkey, Christmas Monkey, no one's sung about Christmas Monkey. Christmas Monkey's got no song and it's been that way for much too long."" Overall, the music in this movie is pretty painful. And, of course, with Steve and Betsy comes Charkie, barking constantly. I am not a Charkie fan.

We all liked Curious George: A Halloween Boofest (once I got used to the some-what annoying songs), and I hoped A Very Monkey Christmas would be at least that good, if not better. My kids, ages 5 and 2, do like this movie, but I'm disappointed. I'd remove it from our collection, but my daughter has an excellent memory and it has become part of her holiday movie tradition. So, I try to hide it under other favorites (Frosty, Christmas Eve on Sesame Street, The Grinch, Emmett Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, and even Caillou's Holiday Movie) so the kids don't ask for it too often.",1415145600,11,3510,4.594896331738437

Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.

To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.

We get to see a lot of the regular characters, and follow George and TMITYH while they try to figure out what each other wants for Christmas.  It's funny and touching, and does a great job reinforcing for littler ones that there are things more important than presents at Christmas.

And the songs really do get stuck in your head, they're really good.  Higher quality than most songs in cartoons.

It's a good length to tell a fuller story than the normal short time slot for the PBS cartoon, but not so long that kids get impatient and lose interest.

This one is our house's new ""must watch TV"" for Christmas now.  My son never really got into the older ones I knew as a kid, like Frosty or Rudolph and the other claymation shows. But we watch this all the time - it's on right now, four weeks after Christmas.

Santa isn't heavily featured (I actually don't remember a single Santa reference), though the main plot is about presents.  The man with the yellow hat is trying to figure out what George wants for Christmas is wondering if George would have been happier living with someone else.  But, he is less worried about the THINGS, and more worried about his relationship with George.  Also, in the side stories many of the characters make their presents, putting a lot of thought, effort and creativity into the process.  A good message I think, to avoid materialism and focus on something that you know would mean a lot to someone.

The songs are cute, and everything blends in well with the Curious George television series.",1356652800,2,860,4.777027027027027

The twelve days of Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
Deck the halls
Hark! The herald angels sing
Joy to the world
Jingle bells
Silent Night
Here we come a-wassailing
O come, all ye faithful

4231268,5,B003YLM77G,"""Curious George: A Very Monkey Christmas"". 2009 DVD

In December 2009, this DVD was purchased for Sophie, our granddaughter.  The animated presentation had pretty scenes of a city in December snow, and a nice trip to the country to get a Christmas tree, and baking Christmas cookies and so many other Christmas traditions, all nicely animated.

But, now it is June 2010, and when we babysit Sophie (22 months old), she always selects the yellow case holding this DVD.  So, of course, we have to play the animated movie for her, and our little girl dances to the song, ""A Very Monkey Christmas"", putting her arms in the air to follow the characters on the screen.  She also tries to hum along with the initial Christmas song:

 ""Are you ready for Christmas Day to come?""
  ""Sing it with me, or if you're a monkey, `Hum'"".

My wife,  a retired school teacher, says that George the Monkey uses non-verbal communication, pointing at objects and making monkey sounds, which appeals to young children.  When children are just learning to speak, they seem to be able to follow and enjoy the antics of George the Monkey. The colors, the songs and the plot probably will appeal to older children.  As for me, I liked the portrayal of a city in a snowy December, and the method the Man In the Yellow Hat uses to instill some sense of patience in the little monkey.  The songs are novel and interesting, and low enough so that an old grandfather can sing along.  Watch the light decorations light up as George and The Man In The Yellow Hat walk away after they donate some bills to the Santa ringing the bell.
