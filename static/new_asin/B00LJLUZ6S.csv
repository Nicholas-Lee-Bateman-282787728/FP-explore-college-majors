6488637,2,B00LJLUZ6S,"Ordered this for my daughter as a birthday present.  Fast Prime shippinggot it today andshe was very delighted.  Problem is, about 10 seconds into the song-the music is very distorted.  Previous reviewer said the music box was damaged, but I think there is flaw to the music box.  The music box is battery powered/light sensored so I do not believe this is the result of ""winding down"".  My daughter has decided that she still loves this set and is willing to overlook the flaw-which I hesitate to do because of the cost.  I don't usually leave reviews on items, but feel the next buyer should know about the music box.",1422057600,14,619,4.581818181818182

I contacted the seller and they told me that if I put a light up to it (I used my phone flashlight), and it worked perfectly! As long as I'm in the light, it will play. This may fix issues for other people too if they had the same problem I did. Love it.",1515628800,,409,3.7674418604651163
8666222,4,B00LJLUZ6S,"Except for the music box, everything was fine. It seems either the battery for the music box needs to be changed or it was broken during transport. Beautiful display for the first of thirteen Blu Ray discs.",1480464000,,206,4.594594594594595
8666223,5,B00LJLUZ6S,I love it! It's absolutely beautiful and the music box works perfectly. The animation is stunning and it does have English subtitles. It's smaller than I originally thought it would be but still fits perfectly on my movie shelf. I can't wait for the NA release in August that has all of season 1 in one box set!,1470009600,,311,4.379310344827586
8666224,5,B00LJLUZ6S,"FIRST: TO THE PERSON WHO SAID IT WOULD NOT PLAY, That's because it's a region 2 DVD & you need a region free DVD player to watch it. People need to do their research! Lol :-p Anyways, I am in love with Crystal! It really did grow on me as did the new English dub (which of course, is NOT on this DVD since it's the Japanese version) But if you are looking to get this series I would wait a bit longer because VIZ just announced the crystal box-set! It comes out in August & contains the dark kingdom arc which is episodes 1-14 & it also has English subtitles & the all new dub :) Not to mention you can get the box set for about the price of 1 or 2 of Japanese version blu-rays/DVDs (the Japanese DVDs only have 2 episodes per volume so you only get 2 episodes for whatever price you are paying) If you can wait till then I would definitely do that! Plus you will be officially supporting sailor moon in the U.S. & showing Toei we do want it here FOR GOOD!!! ^_^",1463011200,,962,4.015625

All in all, it is what it says it is.

.However, I was a bit disappointed by the size of the overall packaging. Maybe it is just I didn't carefully compare the size of the Blu ray disc with the outer box, but the box set is MUCH smaller than I thought it would be.

I was thinking the box would be around the size of a Laser Disc box set, maybe 10-12""  but it just a bit larger than the Blu ray disc case, about 8"" square. It also didn't come with box with the drawers pictured. It came with a BR disc in a nice case, two small booklets, the charms.

The good news is that the music played perfectly when I opened the lid.

For maybe $45-$50.. it would have been OK, because the Blu ray itself sells for nearly that, but close to $80.  it is disappointing. As I said in a comment, I am not a collector so I don't plan on spending $1,000. for the complete 13 vol. sets, but what I plan to do is to burn the 1080p eps with En. subtitles from ""Horrible-Subs.com onto one or two Blu Ray -R discs and house the whole 26 ep first season in there too. With that in mind, it is a nice presentation storage set.
Another thing is that I am a bit peeved that the only release 2 eps per Blu Ray disc..what a waste of Blu Ray potential.  Most DVDs or Blu Rays have at least 4 eps per disc. That I could live with...(Maybe it has some extra material on the discs besides the eps. but i haven't played the BR disc yet.

It will be interesting to see if bootleg box sets show up on eBay after the series is completed in Blu Ray. DVD format, though it is highlyy unlikely that the booklets and charms and the music box will be copied, only the box set format, as even for a Chinese or other Asian company wanting to cash in, the copyrights would have to be completely ignored..which except for the discs, would be a stretch.

There is a good YouTube video of the box set being opened and examined if you want to make sure this is for you.

PS Even at the small sizes of the box sets so far released, and which will come with a large storage box if you send in the coupons from each set, it surely will then take up a lot of room considering it will have to hold all 13 box sets!",1436486400,3,2203,3.9705215419501134
8666229,5,B00LJLUZ6S,"Love it,  the music box works great. I was skeptical about it after I bought it,  but I love it it's wonderful!!! It got here faster than it said it would and I can't wait to buy the next one.  I just wish I could read Japanese to read the little paper inside.",1423612800,4,260,3.8679245283018866
