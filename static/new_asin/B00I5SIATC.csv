6251615,3,B00I5SIATC,Good movie. Not the worst. Not the best. But worth wAtching. They just should have went more into detail about the family background.,1405123200,,133,4.826086956521739
6251616,3,B00I5SIATC,"I rented this film on Amazon Instant Video last night. It wasn't very shocking or scarey at all. It was mildly entertaining and got better as the film progressed. The creepy Mother and her oldest Son where the best part of the movie. Overall, it reminded me of a movie I would watch on Netflex and enjoy at the cheapest price. It is just not worth the $3.99 price if you wished to watch it several times. I watched it once and that is just about all the times I want to watch it. It the kind of movie that is good to entertain yourself once and that is just about it. The plot is pretty simple and as usual the family being tormented is ridiculously naive and annoying, especially the Father.",1404604800,3,692,4.25
6251617,2,B00I5SIATC,This movie could have been better.  Seems like it was rushed.  Missing details like how and why the son turned out that way.  Disappointing.,1402272000,,140,4.75
6251618,4,B00I5SIATC,"Misclassified by Redbox as horror, this is actually a story about a new family moving in next door to a normal one and then things go south.  Nothing supernatural or sinister.",1400803200,2,175,4.645161290322581
6251619,4,B00I5SIATC,"{3.5 stars}

First off, the cover is a bit misleading and may attract the wrong audience for this film while scaring away the right one. At first glance, I thought PLAYDATE would be another of them zombie horror flicks, but it's actually a Lifetime film which, though truly suspenseful and disturbing in places with some good jump scenes, has very little in the way of schlocky gore and nothing in the way of supernatural elements.

Anyway, the Valentines, a nice, patently normal L.A. family, get some new neighbors, single mom Tamara Moor and her two sons, Titus and Billy. The Valentines try to be neighborly, Tamara does the same, and young Olive Valentine finds a much-needed friend in Billy. The Moors, however, hide some very dark family secrets. . .

I wasn't expecting much from PLAYDATE, but it proved to be something of a pleasant surprise. It has the usual stilted Lifetime directing with melodramatic instrumentals constantly playing in the background. Still, it also has better acting and much livelier/more loaded dialogue than most made-for-TV affairs. [Wow, is Lifetime actually growing up?!] The plotline pretty much follows the formula, albeit with a few nice new flourishes. There aren't a lot of big surprises, but there are a number of good smaller ones. If y'all want to place bets on how PLAYDATE ends up, the chances are that no one will be right on the money even if some of you come fairly close. Despite the various oversimplifications, blank spots, and unlikelihoods, suspense thriller fans who aren't too picky should enjoy and may even really love PLAYDATE.",1396742400,3,1588,4.962406015037594
6251620,3,B00I5SIATC,"Emily (Marguerite Moreau) just quit her job to be an at home mom. Dad (Richard Ruccolo) spends all his time restoring a 64 Mustang, but doesn't know a lot about cars. They also have a daughter (Natalie Alyn Lind) Olive. A family moves next door that gives Emily a high creep factor. They are apparently connected to the opening scene of a boy dieing.

Single mom Tamara (Abby Brammell) is very protective of her two sons Billy (Aidan Potter) and Titus (Julien Dean Lacroix). As issues invade Emily's family she begins snooping.

The whole film is a mystery thriller. You know something is wrong with the family and with only three people in the family you really don't rack your brains trying to figure things out before they reveal things at the one hour mark. The film builds up for about 10 minutes of thrills at the end. Acting is about what you would expect- passable.

This is a made for Lifetime TV movie which aired April 28, 2012 at 8PM. It is being recycled at Redbox. 2 1/2 stars.",1396569600,2,991,4.4944444444444445

6251622,2,B00I5SIATC,"The only reason I considered watching this movie, is that it rated 3 stars.  I only watch movies that are rated 3 stars or higher.  I don't know how this movie managed to get a 3 star rating.  I gave it 2 stars because the story idea could have been good,  if it had been written a lot better.  It was full of Politically Correct nonsense, especially the Husband making fun of his ""Alpha Male"" activities of working on his car, like he would know an Alpha Male, if one was standing in front of him.  The Wife who really is missing the work that fulfils her, but instead is at home with Husband and Daughter,  which is so boring, because She is a People Person, which of course leads her to be a major busy body, at the new neighbor's house, getting into the new neighbor's business, because I guess that's what People Person's do.  The story left a lot questions unanswered, that resulted in a movie, that left you thinking, I just wasted my time, when I could have been watching something else.  I am a Prime member, so the movie was free, for me to watch, which was a good thing!",1492732800,,1081,4.259803921568627
6251623,3,B00I5SIATC,"Interesting build up, you are left wondering what exactly is going on the entire movie and begin to draw conclusions, the ending however was a let down, and a tad unusual for the kind of build up they created for the characters. Overall, the movie started out well but began to slow down and become less thrilling after the first half.

6251625,1,B00I5SIATC,"It is so horrible. I rarely say this about any movie, it's just so bad.
Spoiler: the dog gets killed, it's really messed up, happens around : 41 minutes in, just skip that minute. I wasn't ready for that scene, mostly because any dog lover cannot handle that stuff.
The rest of the movie was really boring, with good acting. Typical lifetime movie of the week filler. It could have been halfway decent if they just advanced the plot and didn't have the parents ignoring every single red flag.
Oh well, it was free.",1487980800,,514,4.4787234042553195
