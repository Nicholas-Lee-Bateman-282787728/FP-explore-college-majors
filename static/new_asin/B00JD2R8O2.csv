8649792,5,B00JD2R8O2,"This is an excellent look at a forgotten mining town that can only be accessed a few months out of the year.  I found the story of this ghost town to be very interesting as well as what was involved to reach this old town.  To hear the stories of what life was like for those that lived here was quite an eye opener.  This documentary has the production value of what you would see on a TV show but does not have all the ""reality show drama"" or made up elements that tend to go with shows covering a topic like this.  I would highly recommend this documentary for those who are a fan of history and can appreciate a REAL search for paranormal activity.",1413244800,,652,4.150793650793651
