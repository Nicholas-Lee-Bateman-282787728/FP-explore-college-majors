8084044,1,B000A26M2I,I did not see any topics on Web Services. Totally misleading title. I totally agree with the other reviewer.i would give no stars at all for this one,1131148800,2,149,4.357142857142857
8084045,1,B000A26M2I,"Only reason I did not return this was because Amazon only gives back 50% of the money for opened DVD.

There is nothing about Web service in the DVD's. It only talks about servlets and JSP's.

The DVD quality is very poor. Editing and sound are bad.

The content of the DVD are way off the title on the DVD.

People look at the title and description to buy the DVD.",1130198400,5,365,4.098591549295775
