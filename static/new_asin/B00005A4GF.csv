7935001,4,B00005A4GF,"There is nothing world shaking about this film--it is the tale of an adulterous husband and a homocidal au pair/paramour and their attempts to get free of the lady of the house (Kathleen Quinlan, looking pretty haggard).  However, it is nonetheless a very entertaining story, particularly thanks to the talents of Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo.  These two, who play the wife's best friend and the cop on the case, have a very nice, comedic chemistry and their pursuit of the evildoers is quite gripping as well as quite funny.  The plot, while containing nothing really new, is still engrossing and the suspense level, as it builds, is pretty intense.  I found it a very satisfying way to spend a couple of hours.",1171065600,8,713,4.772357723577236
