The description: ""for home use"" suggested it's instructional.  It's not.  $20 is a bit steep for a 43 minute film with such generalities and virtually no mention of the actual practice or process.  I will add that I find Father Keating's countenance and persona very appealing, healing, inspiring- wonderful, but there was that in abundance (along with more personal self-disclosure) in the Rising Tide video, which sells for $10 and is twice as long.  Overall, disappointed.

Added later: I found&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Centering-Prayer-and-Inner-Awakening/dp/B009LP1450/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Centering Prayer and Inner Awakening</a>, by Cynthia Bourgeault, and it's not only splendid, inspiring, a gift, and a great read, but it covers every detail of the practice, including obstacles and how to overcome them.",1474243200,,1538,8.119047619047619

8369112,4,B002FL3IP6,"I didn't give it 5 stars because there was a lot of time taken interviewing other people.  Good interviews, but I was hoping for much more content to be on Father Keating.  Very sound and modern production.",1388880000,3,206,4.54054054054054
8369113,5,B002FL3IP6,"There is a lineage...
In my life it began with Thomas Merton in the slim book the Silent Life and then continued through other slim texts on the Psalms and other novice formations. After Merton came Basil Pennington though he had been tossed the baton rather hurriedly when Thomas Merton died sooner than anyone was prepared to cope with. Then came Andre Louf who perhaps mapped the Cistercian Way more clearly and with increasing depth. And here is Thomas Keating who here speaks of a life of love and healing not as some exclusive club but rather speaks from an all inclusive heart. I invite you to listen with a pad of paper and pen. Be prepared to pause and note the few words or phrases that draw your attention or ring in your heart at a level that only you may know the particular relevancy...  If you have had the experience, your heart will know what he is talking about.

8369116,5,B002FL3IP6,"I owe a great debt to Fr. Keating and I want to encourage you to have a chat with him. This video contains
a very clear distillation of many, many years of contemplative thought while genuinely searching for
contact and more- a relationship with God. Loving God is not possible unless a grace is granted. God will
remain to you a concept or projection of your own imagination. Defining what it is you mean by ""loving"" God
is difficult because of the 6 meanings of the word ""love"" in english. Father Keating will help you see
what is meant clearly.

Those warnings and encouragements given and then placed to the side, Fr. Keating will in this short interview show you
what genuine contact with your Creator is and why you have failed to gain it in the past and how
once knowing what it is you are asking to gain a relationship that is at once dissolving of your
personal being and accepting of you as you are as a person so that you may gain the ultimate
goal of being a person. It is a great discription of the process of being-of moving toward what is the
ultimate reason for being in the first place. I do hope God grants
you the grace to seek and love Him. You will find that without that grace, the task reverts back to simple
imagination and dryness due to lack of consolations and progress in healing. You must heal to gain the
prize, you see.

Listen to Father Keating and see if what I have told you is true. And if it is, if you too will owe him a great debt.
And if you , Father Keating, I and millions of others may meet again as true friends of Jesus and be adopted children
having made a most wonderous and difficult journey a personal resounding success.

The least you will gain is a few moments of genuine peace. Well worth your 45 minutes of listening to Father Keating.",1318550400,7,1788,4.299703264094956
