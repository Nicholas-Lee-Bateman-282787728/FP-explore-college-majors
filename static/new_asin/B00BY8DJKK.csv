8575443,4,B00BY8DJKK,"This movie is fun mainly because it's like a time capsule of the 1950's California, the clothes, the contemporary home, the snotty daughter, and Ginger Rogers bringing her talents into a new generation (and Ginger looks great in the wardrobe, very sharp!)  Yes, the lines are a bit awful lol...but in a good way.  The title implies it's some type of rebel without a cause biker movie or something, but that's not really the case.  It does have a plot with an emotional feeling to it, with some good confrontations between mother and daughter.  Would I recommend this movie? Yes, if you're a fan of this genre, a fan of campy 50s, the whole atmosphere and the social/cultural things going on at that time.  It's a classic in its own way!",1433376000,,736,4.587786259541985
8575444,4,B00BY8DJKK,I am a Michael Rennie and also a Ginger Rogers fan ~ so I ordered this sweet story of a daughter who visits her mother for the first time in about 8 years and tries to fit in with the neighborhood and  be normal ~ like the family she wished she had ~ The 1950's style house they live in is part of the story and adds to the atmosphere ~ ~ ~ There is some dancing ~ swing ~ ~ ~ but this is not a musical ~ It has a happy ending uniting the mother (Rogers) and the daughter happily :),1428105600,,482,3.679611650485437

8575446,5,B00BY8DJKK,Amazing movie I've been wanting to see it for a while now and was excited about and it broke my expectations rhank you,1421884800,,118,4.173913043478261
8575447,2,B00BY8DJKK,I hate that I didn't like it because I LOVE Ginger Rogers. The young girl's acting made me so uncomfortable that I had to watch most the movie through my fingers. Melodramatic.,1394668800,,176,4.53125
8575448,5,B00BY8DJKK,"I liked this movie because it starred my favorite actress, Ginger Rogers, who does her usual outstanding job, of interpating the character that she portrays.",1387152000,,157,5.32
8575449,5,B00BY8DJKK,"I love classic movies and ""Teenage Rebel"" is one of my favorites. The film is interesting not only from the story-line, but also from the artistic point of view as well. The leading actors are Ginger Rogers, Michael Rennie, Betty Lou Keim, Warren Berlinger and Diane Jergens. Incredible cast and incredible play, especially I like Ginger Rogers play, it adds much to the impression of the film.",1386720000,3,394,4.895522388059701
8575450,5,B00BY8DJKK,"As always Ginger Rogers shows her varied talent in this serious role.  She does a wonderful job.  Amazing the girl who plays her daughter in this movie marries in real life the young man who is also in this movie and they were married for years until her passing.  If you are a collector of Ginger's movies, buy this.",1376784000,7,317,4.338983050847458
