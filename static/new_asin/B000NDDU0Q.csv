2764922,5,B000NDDU0Q,"Victor Mature and Richard Conte star in Cry Of The City (1948)
which is a surprisingly excellent crime drama. I used the word
surprisingly because I had never seen this film before and it
doesn't have the reputation of Double Indemnity or Out Of The Past.

Any movie with supporting players such as Shelley Winters, Betty Garde
and Hope Emerson, is definitely going to grab my attention. All three
deliver great performances, but Miss Emerson steals the show as a
tougher-than-nails dame, similar to her role in Caged (1950).

This is the best black and white print I have seen from
Fox Cinema Archives. The picture quality is glorious as is the
cinematography which adds to the film's enjoyment. I highly
recommend Cry Of The City to all lovers of Film Noir and
tense crime dramas.",1382227200,43,782,4.742647058823529
2764923,4,B000NDDU0Q,"Conte, the baddie, vs. Mature, the good guy....Conte shows his acting chops as a wounded criminal...Taut and exciting from the first scene until the end....A worthy addition to anyone's film noir library....",1380758400,4,207,5.5
2764924,2,B000NDDU0Q,"""Cry of the City"" is a black and white 1948 crime drama with the familiar plot of two kids who grew up together, one of whom became a cop (Victor Mature) and the other a criminal (Richard Conte). The film also hatches the all too familiar plot of the struggle for the soul of the next generation (Tommy Cook).

Intense Richard Conte (1910-1975) plays a cop killer on the run who is trying to protect his teenage lover. Conte was prominent in war films (""A Walk in the Sun"") and film noir (""The Sleeping City"", ""The Blue Gardenia""). He's probably best known as mafia boss Don Barzinii from ""The Godfather"" (1972). This is one of his most charismic roles.

Victor Mature (1913-99) plays the Police Lieutenant pursuing Conte. Mature made his film debut in 1940 in ""One Million BC"" and unfortunately this typecast him forever as ""beefcake"", despite some good performances films like ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946), ""Kiss of Death"" (1947) and ""The Robe"" (1953). Mature does a credible job.

Fred Clark (1914-68) plays Mature's sidekick. Clark was a versatile actor, who could do comedy (""Auntie Mame"", ""The Caddy"") as well as drama (""Sunset Blvd"", ""A Place in the Sun"", ""White Heat"", ""Flamingo Roard""). He's probably best known as the neighbor on ""George Burns and Gracie Allen Show"",

Berry Kroeger (1912-91) plays a sleazy lawyer. Kroeger was originally a radio announcer, then turned his attention to film where he played villainous roles in more than a dozen films (""Act of Violence"", ""Gun Crazy""), then became a staple on TV detective series.

Shelley Winters (1920-2006) plays one of Conte's girlfriends.  Winters was a great actress, nominated 4 times for an Oscar and winning twice (""Diary of Anne Frank"", ""A Patch of Blue""). She also earned 3 Emmy nominations and 1 win in 1964. She won the Golden Globe for ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972). For people who remember her when she was grossly overweight, the young Shelley Winters was among the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. She has a brief role in this film.

Hope Emerson (1897-1960) makes her film debut as a masseuse who works as a part-time criminal. She stood 6' 2"" and weighed over 200 pounds. She often played the role of a sadist (""Caged"", 1950) but could also play broad comedy (""Westward the Women"", 1952 ""Adam's Rib"" 1949). She's best known for her role as ""mother"" in TV series ""Peter Gunn"" (1958-9).

This was also the film debut of Debra Paget (1933), known for her westerns (""Broken Arrow"") and biblical spectacles (""Demetrius and the Gladiators"", The Ten Commandments"") in the 50s. She plays Conte's fiance.

Look for Roland Winters (1904-89) as a prison guard. Winters was the third Charlie Chan, starring in 6 films between 1947 and 1949.

German born director Robert Siodmak (1900-73) specialized in using German expressionist film techniques to create moody and memorable films in the 40s - ""Son of Dracula"" (1943), ""The Suspect"" (1944), ""The Spiral Staircase"" (1945) and his Oscar nominated film noir ""The Killers"" (1946). Unfortunately Siodmak's considerable skills are not on exhibit in this film.

Screenwriter Richard Murphy (1912-93) was nominated for two Oscars (""The Desert Rats"", ""Bommerang"") and several WGA awards including this film and ""Panic in the Streets"".

The NY Times called the film ""taut and grimly realistic"" and Variety called it a ""topnotch presentation"".

In 1948, Bogart and Huston teamed up to make the #4 (""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"") and #12 (""Key Largo"") top grossing films of the year and went on to win two Oscars (Director, Supporting Actor). Other top 10 grossing films that year were ""The Red Shoes"", ""The Three Musketeers"", ""Red River"", ""Easter Parade"", ""Johnny Belinda"", ""The Snake Pit"" and ""Joan of Arc"".

Crime films were popular in 1948 - Fred Zinnemann's ""Act of Violence"" with Robert Ryan and Van Heflin, John Farrow's ""The Big Clock"" with Ray Milland and Charles Laughton, Henry Hathaway's ""Call Northside 777"" with James Stewart and Richard Conte, ""Force of Evil"" with John Garfield,  and ""The Naked City"".

This film is often mistaken for film noir, which it clearly is not. Nor is it a great crime drama, but rather an ordinary ""catch the killer"" yarn that has been done many times before and since.",1366934400,5,4229,4.968838526912181
2764925,5,B000NDDU0Q,"Thought it was just as I had remembered it from a kid. is a good moivie, appreciated you getting it for me. Now if you can get me a copy of City Across The River, would be greatly appreciated, as a young boy of 10, we would go after school and watch them making the movie, in our neiborhood, Williamsburg Brooklyn.

2764926,5,B000NDDU0Q,"CRY OF THE CITY (1948) is definitely a film I would purchase if it ever comes available on DVD.

The plot is common enough; Richard Conte plays a hood who has been caught, patched up in the prison hospital, and escapes.  He finds and kills the lawyer who was trying to frame him for another robbery.  The lawyer is played by Berry Kroeger (if Charles Laughton and Orson Welles had a love-child, it would be exactly like Kroeger).  Victor Mature (as Lt. Candella) is out to bring Conte to justice.

By all accounts, it sounds rather run-of-the-mill; like something we've been through enough times before.  But I think the difference may be Robert Siodmak, the director who also gave us THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE (1945), THE KILLERS (1946), and soon CRISS CROSS (1949).  Perhaps it is also that Ben Hecht helped with the screenwriting (uncredited).

Whatever the reason, CRY OF THE CITY has an interesting texture.  By that, I mean the noirs up until 1948 seem to be quite cold; the city is an unfeeling, uncaring character in the drama.  But here, it is perceived more as a warm place that ""cries"" for the weak.  And, as in PITFALL, the domestic situation plays an important role.  The scenes with Conte's Italian tenement-based family members add quite a bit of local color.  They remind us of what Conte has thrown away in his pursuit of crime.  Recommended.",1276128000,18,1354,4.706382978723404
2764927,5,B000NDDU0Q,"I had to wait as long for the shipment of this Brazilian release of this  classic film noir to arrive as it took Noah to find dry land - forty days - but it was worth it. The movie asks the question what is so insidiously evil about the nature of crime, and answers it in the character of Martin Rome (Richard Conte, in a great performance). But Rome is such a charming character (and he HAS been framed for a murder he didn't commit), so it requires police lieutenant Candella (Victor Mature) to make the final assessment for us about all the people who have come to grief through helping this cunning criminal. A dark, provocative picture that is overdue for domestic release in TCF's Film Noir Collection.

It's a perfect candidate for dvd so I wonder why it is not available especially since 20th century Fox has been putting a number of their noirs on dvd. With the popularity of film noir and particualrly in the B category with many great titles, here is an A film that is terrific. It's no ""Kiss of Death"" but it is a definite thumbs up.

After doing some ridiculous costume epics, Victor Mature showed that he could act; and Richard Conte is always terrific in films noirs.

2764938,5,B000NDDU0Q,"Without a doubt the best print and mastering I've seen of this film, until now available only overseas on DVD.  The film deserves a regular 4-star rating as far as I'm concerned, five here for its first DVD release and excellent quality.  Robert Siodmak was a master of film noir and in Cry of the City he explores New York City settings, atmosphere, and ethnic qualities (including a scene where Richard Conte as Martin Rome calls Berry Kroeger as an attorney a thief in Italian).  The score by Alfred Newman is both dramatic and lyrical.  There are a few mistakes in filming or the film was edited after its release and several scenes cut, as reported on the imdb.com site.  Cry deserves a much-needed remastering for Blu-ray and I wish Criterion would take up this task with the BFI print.",1385769600,9,792,4.628571428571429

A man lies in a bed while a priest prays over him. A nurse tells the police about his condition. A lawyer visits to get a confession from Martin Rome to save his client. Niles speaks to Rome with the police detectives present; no deal. As Rome recovers he is questioned by the police. He won a ring in a dice game; it was stolen in a murder-robbery. Martin asks Miss Pruitt to warn his girlfriend to get away. Lawyer Niles asks Rome to admit to a crime and make a deal. No deal. Niles tells Rome the police are looking for his girlfriend; there is a violent reaction from Rome! Lt. Candela talks about Romes fate. Martin sent money to his mother every week. Candela asks about Romes girlfriends. Rome is in jail; can he break out? Candela delivers soup from Momma. They talk about their lives. Candela mentions girls names to Rome.

Rome decides to break out; he puts on his clothes and gets a pass so he walks out. The police are watching the neighborhood. Tony makes a telephone call to Niles office. Martin discusses money with Niles and inspects the safe. There is a package with jewels in it! Niles makes a bad career move. Martin flees and finds a refuge. Why must he kill? His leg needs bandaging, he must go elsewhere. Lt. Candela arrives for a visit, he wants to see Tony, Martins brother. Candela talks to Tony, Martin left with a bad leg. A woman wants to find the address of Madame Rose for Martin, who is not doing well. She finds a man to help Martin; he wants brandy now. What will happen? Marty goes to visit Madame Rose. Was she involved in that jewel theft? They make a deal, but Martin must sleep first. Marty has a plan to leave the country.

The police question the doctors who might have treated Martin. One has $200 in his wallet. [A very large sum in those days.] He doesnt know their names. Lt. Candela gets a telephone call from Martin, he is told about a woman who will collect the jewels. But Madame Rose is cautious, she sends Martin ahead of her! The police arrest Rose with the jewels in her hand, she fires a pistol and shoots Candela! Candela visits Miss Pruitt and learns about her friend and Martin. Will Martin steal from his mother? Tina doesnt want to leave with Marty; hes changed. Candela arrives to talk to them. Martin uses people then brushes them aside. He tells Tina to go home. Then he and Marty talk. Martin walks away, Candela fires one shot. People gather to look at the body. Hes dead says Tony.

This movie tells a story about criminals and their fate. Those who commit crimes suffer their deserved fate. Its like a sociological study of urban life, the obverse of the Westerns that were popular then. Notice the wet streets and sidewalks at night? That was done for the photographic effects. The description of Martin as someone who uses people and then discards them suggests a psychopathic personality.",1508198400,,2884,4.466793168880455
8176861,5,B000NDDU0Q,"This is absolutely the BEST film noir I have ever seen!!  Victor Mature was perfect in his role. No over-under acting, nothing fake or contrived. Just perfection.  The music is called Street Scene which is also featured in I Wake Up Screaming - also with Victor Mature.  But this film!  Richard Conte plays Richard Conte as usual. Cold-blooded and hard.  The supporting cast played their roles as though they were eligible for Academy Awards.  Stellar performance by Hope Emerson.
This move was gritty, gritty, gritty. But the best part is the raw emotion demonstrated by the characters.  Mama was superb as Richard Conte's tortured son-gone-bad mom.  His brother also just wrenched your heart at the end of the film.  The story line was of course, the good guy going after the bad guy. But there all similarity ends.  Woven into the story is the impact that the crime has on other people and the compassion that Victor Mature demonstrates is extraordinary.  The humor was given out in small doses, but like one-liners, well done.  I can't say enough about this movie.  I'm amazed that I had never seen it until recently.

8176866,5,B000NDDU0Q,"Cry of the City is a crime drama set in new York City. Martin Rome (Richard Conte) commits a jewel theft and is held in a prison hospital awaiting trial and facing execution for killing a police officer during the botched robbery. Police Lt. Candella (Victor Mature) visits him, hoping to get Rome to reveal the identity of a young girl (Debra Paget), who may be involved. Rome and Candella knew each other as kids in their Italian immigrant neighborhood. When Rome manages to escape, Candella is on his trail as suspense mounts in this atmosphere-rich film noir.

Though the story isn't all that original, director Robert Siodmak gives it great style by evoking an urban landscape of shadowy, rain-soaked city streets and the ever-present din of traffic and police sirens. He portrays the deprivation and danger of ghetto life as well as the citys ever-present corruption. The location filming gives the film an almost documentary-like feel, yet retains Siodmaks trademark expressionistic studio look.

Both Conte and Mature turn in first-rate performances, elevating this low-budget picture considerably. Shelley Winters, Fred Clark, and Berry Kroeger (as a shady lawyer) co-star. Though released as a B movie in 1948, Cry of the City has become a classic of American noir cinema. Its reputation has grown over the years because of critical reassessments from film scholars. Though it is a class act, it doesnt disappoint as a taut, fast-paced crime thriller.

Special features on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary by film historian Eddie Muller and a trailer gallery.",1479168000,,1581,5.16796875

If you've seen The Big Combo he plays a similar character here with near identical type acting.
