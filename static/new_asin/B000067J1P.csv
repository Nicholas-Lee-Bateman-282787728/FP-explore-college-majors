1717056,5,B000067J1P,"When you think of popular movies, ""The Sound Of Music"" is definitely going to be on many people's lists. Infact, it's probably the most famous movie of all time, with more than 1 billion people having seen it. The words of the movie title are so famous, and the whole story of the film is just part of cinema legend. When it was released in cinemas back in 1965 it captured the imaginations of all those who viewed it, and this fact still remains by people who view it for the first time today. The scenery of the film, along with the classics songs in it have made The Sound Of Music a legendary experience in cinematic history and an icon out of Julie Andrews.
The plot of The Sound Of Music is simple and easy to follow. The film is set in Salzburg, Austria in the last Golden Years of the 1930's before World War II choked Europe. Maria (Julie Andrews) is training to be a nun, but her frequent faltering in obeying tasks causes Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) to re-think Maria's potential position in the Abbey. She sends Maria to Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) to act as a governess and govern his highly eccentric seven children. Since their mother passed away, the seven children have had a string of governesses look after them. All of which could not cope with the demanding task of managing the troublesome seven. Maria reluctantly agrees with Mother Abbess, and makes her way to the household. At first she finds it difficult identifying with the children and getting them to open up, but as time goes by they gradually succumb to Maria's charms and her adorable ways.
Over time, Maria poses a problem for Georg's new love interest who plans to marry him for his money. She tries to drive Maria away by embarrassing her at a party, and she does, for a brief while. Maria returns to the Abbey with Mother Abbess, who inspires her to return, no matter what the consequences. The final outcome is one of courage, power, love and the restoration of faith. It's a heart-warming tale of family values that appeals to people of all ages. I loved this film the first time I saw it, and my Grandma loves it even more! Some people think it's corny, but they're the critics who don't like something that achieves success because it's good. It's also a rather camp film, which makes it so much more fun in my eyes.
The most famous scene in the film is the opening sequence, where we are given a stunning view of the entire country. The rolling hills, the snow-covered mountain peaks, and the tranquil lakes. The camera moving in to Maria on the hill as she spreads her arms and sings ""The hills are alive, with the sound of music!"" is just superb. What an opening to a film. From here on, the scenery of the film just continues to expand and grow. The mansion is a beautiful place to live with its surrounding lake, and the city is a picturesque landscape that defines the time and culture.
It is almost impossible to review The Sound Of Music without mentioning the music that makes it such a classic film. From the first song, ""The Hills Are Alive,"" you know this is going to be something spectacular. ""Maria,"" ""I Have Confidence,"" ""Sixteen Going On Seventeen,"" ""My Favourite Things,"" ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""The Lonely Goatherd,"" ""So Long, Farewell,"" ""Climb Every Mountain,"" ""Something Good,"" and ""Edleweiss"" are all amazing compositions. It's musical music, and not really something I would usually like, but you just can't help but hum along. You know all the lyrics and have known them for years. They're forever etched into your memory, and you know they're never gonna leave!
The Sound Of Music is an exceptional film that everyone should see. It's a film where nothing bad happens. You won't find any death or violence in this. It's a very stereotypical film, but one that everyone can relate to at the same time. I urge you to buy this DVD, because this is a film that you can watch again and again. It's a masterpiece and to buy it would be a very wise move indeed.",1072915200,6,3976,4.562237762237762
1717057,5,B000067J1P,"Its become fashionable to make fun of this musical, but the truth is that its still a great movie, great music, and uplifting message. Maria, the young woman who just couldn't make it within the confines of a nunnery, leaves the convent and becomes nanny for a widow with a bazillion cute kids. In his grief and ineptitude, he has been trying to run the household along military lines, and it falls to Maria to add warmth, sunshine, music and love back into their lives. The movie is set in Salzburg during the early years of the Nazi occupation of Austria and is based on the true story of the Von Trapp family. Love, tragedy, drama, suspense, a daring escape over the Alps  and joy. Who could ask for more from a film?
And then theres the music, the Rogers and Hammerstein score from the Broadway play, which has given us such timeless tunes as How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria, My Favorite Things, Edelweiss, So Long  Farewell, etc.
With Julie Andrews as Maria and Christopher Plummer as the Baron von Trapp, its a winner for all ages.",1072915200,4,1043,4.484210526315789

I love when Maria is in the abbey and the nuns sing ""How do you solve a problem like Maria?"" It's very light-hearted when it needs to be and very serious when needs be.  We all need a touch of light-heartedness now and again.  I recommend The Sound of Music to just about anyone and everyone... I actually have the 2 DVD set.  I love the ""extras"" that you get.",1049673600,2,469,4.235955056179775
1717060,5,B000067J1P,"1965: Julie Andrews once again captures audiences in a musical film. The previous year, 1964, she won the Oscar for Best Actress in Mary Poppins. The Sound Of Music was based on the true account of the Von Trapp family singers, who fled Nazi Germany during WWII. Julie Andrews portrays Maria Von Trapp, formerly a novice nun who became the wife of the naval sea captain portrayed by the handsome Christopher Plummer. The fictionalized account is often sugary, with Julie Andrews providing much of the sunshine, but the last part of the film, as the Von Trapps flee from the Nazis, is darker than most films Julie Andrews has made.
The ""nanny"" or governess role seems to fit Julie Andrews perfectly. As Maria Von Trapp, the governess to seven children, she is an echo of her role as Mary Poppins. She sings her way to the children's hearts and wins the hand of their father, the uptight, repressed captain. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer have genuine chemistry on the screen. Unforgettable is the Wedding Scene, in which Julie Andrews marries the captain in a long, dragging white gown at the cathedral. The songs are greatfrom this musical, which had in fact been a Broadway musical by Rogers and Hammersteins (this film, in fact, was a descendant of ""The King and I"" with a similar governess/master theme.
""My Favorite Things"", ""I have confidence"", ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"", ""Do-Re-Mi"" and the eponymous song ""The Sound of Music""- which opens with Julie Andrews running across the Alpine hills of Austria, are memorable songs which have become part of American culture. On DVD, the experience is superb and beautiful, with trailers and features that are delightful, recalling an innocent time, recalling the poignant magic the film had years ago, fresh and strong even today.",1048636800,2,1787,4.96
1717061,5,B000067J1P,"Although the state of our culture these days has very little time and room for full-blown musicals, the fact that anyone's first introduction to this film genre is by way of 'The Sound Of Music' necessitates it as a fixture. And what's tehre not to like, as like holiday cheer, there's something for both adult and kids. As a kid, for example, you may enjoy the story as one of how the Von Trapp children learn to sing. As you grow up, you may begin to appreciate the romance and then finally, the Von Trapps' escape from the Nazis. The movie tackles and combines this multitude of plot angles so effectively that no stage version can hold a candle to its celluloid competitor.
The songs stick in our minds because they're easily converted into ditties for kids, so we've all grown up singing them -- whether or not we've seen the movie. Very rarely is one familiar with all the songs from one show, and able to sing them with gusto!",1043452800,,933,4.461988304093567

1717224,3,B000067J1P,"I have always loved ""The Sound of Music"", but unfortunately every version of the film (except for once on TV) leaves out a very important bit of dialogue between the Baroness and ""Uncle Max"" when she states, ""As a matter of influence, the person you should be talking to is me.  Oh, he hasn't asked me to marry him yet, (referring to the Captain) but he will.  Then we'll see who gets credit for getting those children in the festival.""  I may not be stating these lines verbatim, but you get the idea.  This little speech is a testament to the Baroness's true character, and yet it has been left out.  This is not good and I cannot for the life of me understand why this bit has been edited out yet again.  I hope maybe one day I can find a version where this part has not been deleted, but until then, I will do without having this film in my DVD collection.",1358812800,6,860,4.213414634146342

1717226,5,B000067J1P,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I own the Widescreen version, but my mom doesn't like it. She hates the black bars on the top and bottom.

Now that TVs are becoming more wider, movies are being released on DVD in Widescreen format.

My mom said she still wants to have the Full Screen version of this movie so that it fits the entire screen (without black bars). So I ordered a used copy of this! I have compared it with my Widescreen DVD and it DOES cut off the left and right side of the movie, as I assumed it would. But it does not make the DVD any less enjoyable. The quality is crisp and the sound is excellent. I'm really glad I own BOTH versions of this movie. The Sound of Music is my favorite and is the only movie I own both versions of.

1717293,4,B000067J1P,"When it comes to family-oriented entertainment and especially musicals, it's hard to do better than ""The Sound of Music"".  Not only is the plot very compelling and believable but the songs are simply inspired classics and standards that will continue to be sung many many years from now.  This represents Rodgers and Hammerstein at the top of their creative powers and this together with ""Oklahoma"" represent my favourite musicals of all time.

This dvd version is the full-screen one and after viewing this a couple of times I can't help but feel that I should have gotten the widescreen version instead although as far as full-screen versions go, this is not bad.  The picture quality is well restored although not perfect as not every frame is without some form of minor defect but this is not enough to detract from your viewing enjoyment.  The sound quality is very good though coming in Dolby Digital 4.1 Surround format.  There are no Bonus features of note such as documentaries etc which is disappointing but here's hoping the upcoming Blu-ray version improves upon the picture, sound and bonus features aspects enough for us to shout about.

As far as standard full-screen version dvds go though, this version suffices as a must have in any musical fan's dvd library although you may want to wait for the Blu-ray version if you are intending to upgrade any time soon.",1212710400,,1377,4.858974358974359

1717296,5,B000067J1P,"""The Sound of Music"" was a monster hit when it came out in 1965.  It was a wildly loved by millions.  Children then and children now take to it and love watching it again and again.  The songs are wonderful, instantly memorable, and people love to sing them.  Even today, if you were to start singing almost any of these tunes many people could easily join in.  At the time of its release it became the biggest box office winner of all time and even passed ""Gone With the Wind"".

The story is adapted from the stage show which came from an autobiographical book of the real life story of Maria von Trapp.  The Trapp family that is very much intact, large, and a keeper of the memory.  However, if you hear the comments about this film from self-anointed sophisticates, they drip with condescension and even contempt.  You would think the film to be unimportant commercial drivel.  Certainly, commercial success is no credential of artistic achievement, but neither is it a disqualifier.

So, what is it about this delightful and beautifully done musical that upsets so many people (even as it brings joy to many many more)?  My own view is that there was a change in what a portion of the culture wanted in their art.  They wanted things more ironic, detached, and darker.  This movie is none of that.  While there were still musicals made after the huge success of ""The Sound of Music"", it was definitely a turning point that led to a decline to the present all but extinction of the form (unless you can relate ""Moulin Rouge"" to this film).

However, this film continues to bring happiness to its millions of fans and this is a good DVD of it (although I wish the print could be digitally remastered and the color more even).  The commentary by Richard Wise, the director, is very interesting and informative.  He tells us about the actors, the shooting of the film, the way the actors got along, and he even presents the songs in the film as just orchestra.  It is very interesting to hear what is actually going on underneath the voices.

There is a lot more subtlety in the film than I ever saw as a kid.  Sure, there is that abolished emotion we used to call tenderness, but it does not deserve the accusation of treacle or saccharine that are used to simply dismiss it.

Well done.  Enjoy it and forget the pain junkies who need to be flogged by their entertainments.",1119484800,9,2374,4.52112676056338
1717297,5,B000067J1P,"I first saw ""The Sound of Music"" shortly after its release in 1965, directed by Robert Wise based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical. This was also based on a true story, which takes place in Salzburg, Austria in 1939 prior to World War II when Austria was about to fall into the hands of the Nazi-supported Anschluss. Probably considered by many to be her best role, Julie Andrews plays Maria whose biggest wish was to become a nun, but was constantly led to the beauty of the mountains and arrives late to the covenant. She then gets sent away by the Reverend Mother to care for seven children as a governess belonging to Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a retired naval officer and widower who maintains discipline in the home - that was until Maria arrives and wins the hearts of the children through music as well as winning the heart of Captain Von Trapp himself.

The opening scene is breathtaking, showing the Austrian Alps and the beauty of the landscape until Julie Andrews comes into view where she does that turn and begins to sing the title song. This would have been perfect in 3D.

In reality the Von Trapps, after their daring escape from the Nazis at the Salzburg Festival, fled to Switzerland, and it was after the war they settled in Stowe, Vermont. My parents had the opportunity to personally meet John Trapp, the son of Maria Von Trapp, who was attending Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and was a schoolmate of a personal friend of our family during the early sixties.

Higly recommended, this film brings a lot of delight to those who watch it with its music and scenery all blended into one.",1118102400,3,1645,4.646048109965636
1717298,5,B000067J1P,"Such golden moments in cinema history include the world-famous helicopter-shot zoom-in on Julie Andrews spinning joyfully around in the middle of an open green field, the orchestral music rising and Julie starting to sing those opening words in a closeup shot! Absolutely timeless! You know it's a classic already after the first 5 minutes with the long very played-out opening of wind-whistling, helicopter shots of mountains, valleys, lush towns below and the sweeping orchestral music. Same goes for the opening credits. Based on a true story, Julie Andrews is Maria, a young postulant that's just not cut out for convent life. She is sent to be the governess of seven children headed by their strict father Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). She re-introduces music to the Trapp household and brings forth the charm and merriment that they once knew, and works her charm on the Captain, too. As the children learn to sing, Uncle Max (Richard Haydn) finds that this is the great singing group he's been after to exploit to Salzburg, and the children, Maria and the Captain become the Von Trapp Family Singers. This wonderful, lavish story is set against the backdrop of the Nazi invasion of Austria and the Von Trapp's dodging the Nazis and escaping into Switzerland. I have first seen this film back when I was very small and loved every minute of it. Finally, I got this DVD recently and rediscovered all of its breathtaking beauty. It still hasn't grown old. I love the Spanish audio track, too, though no songs are dubbed in Spanish which isn't to speak of for the French audio track. The French female singer dubbing Julie Andrews' songs is actually kind of nice to listen to. There is also a commentary track by Robert Wise, the director with the isolated score; yes, you hear the score by itself with no talking or singing overtop of it. Good for music historians and appreciators. Everybody, no matter who they are, should see this film at least once in their lifetime for it is an all-time essential classic. Highly appealing to children as well as adults, ""The Sound of Music"" is one film that will always be treasured.",1114819200,6,2138,4.844262295081967

1717352,5,B000067J1P,"The Sound of Music is a movie that rightfully earned so many superlatives from the moment it premired in 1965 that almost as soon as it came out, people were also creating spoofs, making fun of the movie. Interestingly enough, Julie Andrews, together with Carol Burnett, created a spoof on The Sound of Music in a Carnegie Hall appearance long before she made the film, and she was as spectacular in that performance as she was in The Sound of Music. The film is now a classic, and it has been immortalized now on DVD.

If I have one critique of the home version, it is that a film such as The Sound of Music was created for the wide screen and simply cannot be displayed in all its magnificence on a small screen. In the opening when the audience views the Austrian Alps and sees the spectacular scenery, those views are so breathtaking on the expanses of the big screen but look so miniscule on a television screen and jokingly small on a DVD screen or computer monitor, so my preference remains to see this film on a large screen with surround sound; it preserves the true magnificence of the film as I remember it originally. However, nothing can really ruin this film; even taken in microcosm, the film is still a masterpiece to behold.

Julie Andrews is a natural in the character of the hapless postulate Maria who can never really fit in as a future nun and ends up becoming the governess at the von Trapp estate. Christopher Plummer assumes the role of Captain von Trapp very convincingly. It turns out that the two did not get along so well, and the love song ""Something Good"" had to be shot in silhouette to hide the fact that they were definitely not amorous with one another in the slightest, but the two play their parts with flair all the way to the end. Eleanor Parker as Baroness von Schrader is a perfect foil to Maria when she shows up for a visit and says, ""My dear, is there anything you can't do?"" Richard Hayden is charming as the amoral entrepreneur Max Detweiler who books the children into the festival and, ultimately, is responsible for enabling the family to escape from the Nazis. Peggy Wood as the Mother Abbess plays a very small part but gets to sing the immortal Climb Every Mountain that is, in many ways, the turning point for Maria in the film.

The children, of course, get quite a bit of the attention as Maria came to care for them. The critics often commented that it was less than convincing that all the children seemed to get along so well without fighting, without having to go to the bathroom or having a runny nose -- well, somehow things like those DID seem to get left out, but in the span of the movie, just how much were they supposed to include and still get in the entire Rodgers and Hammerstein score? The score is such an impressive part of the movie, and the choreography with the children is so well staged -- don't forget that the children were growing during the film, so it was necessary to make adjustments for the changes in height -- that it's important to appreciate the film's many virtues. Note that in the song Do Re Mi, the song covers many different scenes and locations; a lot could have gone on in the interim!

I always found the performance of Charmian Carr to be rather shallow, so it never surprised me that her career ended with this film; many people argued that an ingenue doesn't need to be able to act, but I always argued that she does if she wants to continue acting! Heather Menzies certainly did, as did Nicholas Hammond and Angela Cartwright; of course, Angela Cartwright was already well known to American audiences from television when she did the film.

So much can be said about the film, but one thing I can say that says it all: you'll definitely enjoy it. It's probably the happiest film ever made, and you'll enjoy watching it throughout. If you are the sort of person who likes being happy and likes watching happy films, this is the film for you. Great music, beautiful scenery, and a happy story with a happy ending. How can you go wrong with that?",1109894400,8,4044,4.466847090663058

1717354,5,B000067J1P,The Sound of Music has been one of my favorite musicals since i was a kid well I still kind of am i guess lol (15) Anyway Sound of music is just a great musical the musical numbers r definitley in their own class no other musical can dare even catch them. It's a very happy musical but also very emotional and sad at many parts as you see the characters all go through changes some great (Maria and George being married) but as well terrible changes such as (Liesel losing Rolf so that he may join the Nazis) this is a great musical with so many different angles to watch it from and I suggest you see it many times so you can appreciate it from many different ways.,1107561600,4,666,4.130769230769231
1717355,5,B000067J1P,"Mini Review of one of my top 10 favorite films of all time.

My wife recently advised me that she had not been aware that ""The Sound of Music"" was a successful Broadway musical prior to it's film version.  What was especially startling about that admission was she had seen it performed on the London stage in the early 1990's. She just figured that the producers had adapted it for the stage rather than vice versa.

I believe my wife's mistake is ultimately a tribute to one of the movie's enduring qualities: It takes a stage musical and doesn't make it look staged.  The pictorial majesty of the Austrian Alps that opens the film certainly lends itself to that effect.

The Sound of music is excellent family entertainment.  It has romance, comedy, and International intrigue, lavish musical numbers, cute kids and excellent chemistry between the two leads. Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews give the finest performances of their careers and play off each other extremely well. The part the children play in the movie is well balanced.  The story does not get bogged down in their antics nor does it diminish their importance.

Unlike many Broadway musicals adapted for the screen, the sound of music is not too long.  Weighing in at almost 3 hours it is long, but it does not feel long.  No scene seems redundant or any way unnecessary.  I think the fact that the film does not seem like a stage adaptation is one of the reasons why it does not drag.  The Do Re Mi sequence for instance, changes locations as the song continues showing Maria and the children gallivanting through Salzburg.  If the entire song took place in one setting it's length could grate on the viewer.

The Sound of Music also has done an excellent job of hiding its age.  This is helped in part by the fact that the film takes place 25 years prior to it's filming, so in many senses it never felt modern or contemporary and as a result does not feel dated to the viewer.

For these reasons and many more, The Sound of Music continues to be one of my favorite things to watch.",1105833600,4,2058,4.566757493188011
1717356,5,B000067J1P,"For all that's been written about the schmaltz, this film tackles a theme too often ignored in American movies. This is a film about losing, and no matter how much dancing and singing precedes it, everyone in the film is facing loss.  The Baroness lost her dream match, Von Trapp loses his country, Leisl loses her first love, and who knows what horrors awaited Max and the nuns after the credits faded.  Maybe you have to be older to sense this theme, but once you realize it is there, the film becomes more rich and compelling.",1104192000,18,529,4.5

1717359,5,B000067J1P,"As a child, I probably watched this movie 100 times. My sisters and I would hire it from the video store, and dance around the house to the music - we knew every word by heart, and never grew tired of it.

20 years later, I still love The Sound of Music. The on screen chemistry between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer is in itself worth watching the movie for. The love stories, heartbreak, Maria's journey to self discovery, the delightful von Trapp children, and the building political unrest between the Jews and the Nazis are skilfully blended by Robert Wise to make it a timeless masterpiece.

Aside from the story, the breathtaking Austrian scenery is not to be missed. The Sound of Music held it's ground as the best ever musical between 1965 - 1978 when finally the musical Grease won the top spot.

I now own the movie, and can't wait until my own children are old enough to fall in love with The Sound of Music like I did.",1100822400,5,939,4.4476744186046515
1717400,5,B000067J1P,"This movie combined a very captivating and multi dimensional story . Indeed , this movie is much more than a simple love story , but it is much more than a sad chapter in the middle of the war . This film reached and developed its own profile due precisely its kinetic flexibility and brilliant engaging charm , keeping in mind several fundamental factors.

Obviously the personal charisma of Julie Andrews who somehow was the british answer of the lovely Audrey Hepburn . Andrews owned her own charm : radiance , sweetness and beauty in the purest british mood .

The absorbing and magnetic presence of Christopher Plummer , a very gifted actor who actually is giving a towering and recognized performance in Broadway .

The rest of the cast was a goldness triumph . Who can forget those lovely kids ?

The admirable direction and the spectacular landscapes were too undeniable elements who added its contribution for this eternal picture .

A film to enjoy over and over again!",1091404800,5,979,4.735294117647059
1717401,4,B000067J1P,"I watched the movie last year and i thought it was pretty good. The story is about a free-spirited young novice nun who was sent to be governess for the seven unmanageable children of a widowed captain. There, she caught the hearts of the children, and unknowingly, the heart of their father too.
Loosely adapted from Rodgers and Hammerstein's all-time classic, and inspired by a true story, the sound of music really does live up to its name. Like any archetypical music drama, it features some of the immortal songs ever written like ""I have Confidence"" and ""How to solve the problem of Maria.""
Entirely shot in Salzburg with an A-list cast, the movie bagged five Oscars, including Best Picture. It showcases the sweeping beauty of Austria. With Julie Andrews as lead Maria, who won Best Actress for her role as the magical nanny Mary Poppins, she returns with a wonderful performance singing and dancing and mingling with children here. Christopher Plummer, a veteran actor who looked like a forever grimacing idol, plays her beloved. Charmien Carr, as eldest daughter Liesl, shines too, with her versatile voice and graceful moves (ballet moves, if you call it).
I'd think this is one brilliant film...as i've mentioned above,A-list actors,breathtaking view and wonderful as well as unforgettable songs.
With singing and dancing and the strumming of the guitar, there is only one word to sum the movie: it's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!",1087084800,,1447,5.135593220338983

If you are a big fan of grand scale cinematography this is a great film for you to see.  If you also like musicals this is a must for any fan of the genre.

1717404,5,B000067J1P,"One of the all time great movies that was ever made was the 1965 musical, ""The Sound of Music."" It certainly is one of my favorite films, but it is also one of the best examples of how history gets hacked to pieces to make it more commercial. As a result, I don't think I can ever watch that movie in the same way again. The basic saying in Hollywood is that when you have to make a choice between the facts and the legend, always choose the legend. So how much do you know about the movie's main character Maria Von Trapp as fact--and not legend? You think you know the story. An inept nun gets sent to become a governess for a man with many children, and she ends up falling in love with him, and marrying him much to the adoring approval by the children. Together, they flee the Nazis and live happily ever after. End of story, right? Not even close. This is legend, the kind of stuff Hollywood likes to show. Here are the facts--what Hollywood likes to stay away from.

""The Sound of Music"" MOVIE takes place in the late 1930s, but Maria was born in 1905, and was raised by some relatives in an athiestic/socialistic home. Her ""father"" told her the Bible was just full of fictional stories, but when Maria entered a church thinking she would hear some classical music, she heard instead a sermon on the Bible that so moved her she joined a monistary. This was in 1924. If the time frame provided in ""The Sound of Music"" movie was accurate, Maria would have been a novice nun from 1924 to around 1939. Surely, no one can be an inept nun for that long of a time.

There was a decision to send Maria to the home of retired WWI submarine captain Georg von Trapp, but her position was not as governess to all the children, as the movie portrayed, but specifically to the captain's daughter who was bedridden with rheumatic fever. Maria never returned to the convent,  and married the Captain on November 26, 1927. She entered the Abby in 1924--not that long after WWI.

Captain Von Trapp was born in 1880, and Maria married him in 1927. Now let us do the math. The Captain was 47 years of age at the time; Maria was just 22 years of age. This sounds like something you would read about in Hollywood, where some 70 year old actor marries a giirl barely out of high school and becomes a father for the first time.

When Maria married Captain Von Trap in 1927, the Captain had just twenty years to live. Such was their age difference. He died in 1947 at age 67. Maria at the time of his death was 35. According to the movie, the kids adored Maria, but in reality their first impression was one of resentment, and with the age difference its easy to see why. Here we have a 47 year old man producing three children with a 22 year old woman  --maybe better described as a ""young girl."" People today might accuse him of being a cradle robber, but perhaps times were different. The kids wanted to hang on to their memories of their real mother--not substitute them for this young thing.

But think in terms of making a film about this. Is it as romantic for a 47 year old man to be married to a 22 year old? And how would you film a sequal? Their love was central to the story, and who wants to make a sequal where the man dies about 7-8 years after they were married--by Sound of Music time?

And you know how wealthy Captain Von Trapp was? In reality, he lost most of his money when the banks crashed in 1932. The kids had to go to work to help support the family.

Then consider how Captain Von Trapp was portrayed in the film. He was stern and cold, while Maria was warm and loving. In reality, one of the children descrbes the situation as just the opposite. The Captain was warm and loving, while Maria was dominating and pushy--hardly the Julie Andrews type.
OK. Just enjoy the movie. They don't make songs like these anymore.",1083110400,4,3825,4.3087621696801115

Next time you see it, look for the small details and prepare to be amazed.  Robert Wise was a master filmmaker.  Watch how carefully and beautifully constructed and lit every shot is.  Look at the sets and location shots, who since Robert Wise in 1965 has done created this kind of aching, beautiful detail??  Drop any tendency to be hip while watching this film and allow yourself to be utterly carried away by one of the last opf the master-crafted films to come out of Hollywood, right on the threshold of Hollywood's decline into self-important, sneering mediocrity.  Julie Andrews is often castigated for her perennial goody-goody image, but watch carefully one the most stunningly lovely and frighteningly talented performers of the 20th century.  This is a historically fine performance caught on film that people in the 22nd century will still marvel at.  Eleanor Parker is no slouch either.

Taking place in Salzburg, Austria, Captain Von Trapp, leading his home like he is still an officer in the imperial navy, learns over time how to be a father to his children and to not push them away.  Since his wife passed away, governesses have been hired and have been chased off by the children to gain their fathers attention, until Maria comes to the house and becomes the parental figure the children need in their lives.  She teaches them and forms a strong relationship with them throughout the movie.  When she suddenly leaves the household, it is seen that Captain von Trapp is unaware of the bond he should have with his own children.  Upon Marias return, the Captain realizes he needs to step up as a father and marries Maria, so the children will have a mother again.  As for family, this movie shows the bonds of a family and the growth of a family as a cohesive unit.  Throughout the movie, the familys bond grows closer together and the children reunite with their father as he begins to provide the emotional support they need.  Marias influence on the children gives them discipline and fun at the same time, and eventually leads to her being their mother by marrying the Captain, giving them a strong family core.",1512604800,,1383,4.662551440329218
