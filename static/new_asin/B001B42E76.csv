8281816,1,B001B42E76,"Hey, I want to make a video about me babbling about things into into, like Nick Cave, pop tarts, cats doing crazy things, the last book I read, and sell it on Amazon!

This dvd is ridiculous! Why didn't I read these revews before renting??? Arggg!",1326326400,,247,4.369565217391305
8281817,3,B001B42E76,"I recently purchased this DVD at one of the only remaining record shops left in my area out of pure curiosity. I didn't see the fine print that read ""contains no Radiohead music"" on it until I got home but still wanted to see it. Probably the most interesting aspect of this dvd was the feature that showed still pictures of where the band grew up in Oxford (from where they worked to the street they lived on). I've never seen this before so it was new to me. There's very little actual ""Radiohead"" here and I think I paid way too much for it ($20) but if you're a die-hard fan you'll find it at the very least, interesting. A better option is to try and find it on YouTube and not waste your time with the dvd.",1303516800,,712,4.129496402877698
8281818,1,B001B42E76,Do not waste your money!  I ordered this & when it arrived I immediately opened it up & watched it.  To my surprise when the title\menu came up it said Radiohead's Homework NOT Radiohead's Logical Emotions 2008.  So I then take the DVD out & flip it over.  On the back of the DVD it says Homework on it.  So I don't know if someone accidently put the wrong label on it in the factory or if someone is trying to pawn Homework off as Logical Emotions to get people to buy it.  Either way I was pissed.  Here is a link to Radiohead's Homework:  http://www.amazon.com/Radiohead-Homework-Unauthorized-Documentary/dp/B0000C826C/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1231198803&sr=1-12,1231113600,4,670,5.254716981132075
8281819,1,B001B42E76,"When I bought this, I knew it didn't have any music by Radiohead. I'm not even that interested in whether or not it was authorized by the band. What I thought I was buying was, at the very least, a collection of interviews. I was wrong.

There is probably less than two minutes in this fifty-minute-long DVD in which we actually see or hear anything from the members of Radiohead. No interviews (only seconds-long snippets), no interesting behind-the-scenes stories. No nothing.

All it is, is the camera panning over a collection of (often low-quality) photos of the band while several narrators give you the most basic description of Radiohead's history. Arguably Radiohead's most interesting era, OK Computer, is hardly touched on at all... in fact, during their recap of this album, they play a mind-numbingly tedious and LONG montage of people riding escalators and walking through shopping malls in what I assume to be an attempt to recapture the meaning of the album instead of discussing the album in the first place.

Ignore your curiosity about this DVD, it will only disappoint you!",1229299200,,1093,4.961748633879782
8281820,1,B001B42E76,"I, like the previous reviewers, pre-ordered this thinking it was the first official documentary about Radiohead. However, this DVD is nothing more than the older unauthorized documentary, ""Homework"", re-released with new, more official looking cover art, and a new title. But, when they changed the title on the package, and on the disc art, they forgot to change it in the actual documentary, so the disc menu and the opening credits still say ""HOMEWORK"". I wish these negative reviews would have been here before I ordered. Don't waste your money like I did.",1225065600,3,560,5.032258064516129
8281821,1,B001B42E76,"The way this was presented by Amazon, with an opportunity for ""advance purchase,"" this appeared to be a new Radiohead DVD.  By that, I mean a DVD that the band approved.  That's certainly not the case.

It's understandable why Radiohead doesn't approve this release.  The production quality of the DVD and its packaging is pretty much comparable to that of the bootleg DVDs sold at swap meets.  No liner notes, no pictures, pretty much nothing beyond the disk itself.  In sharp contrast, Radiohead always gives it fans something worthwhile.

If you look hard and read the fine print, you'll learn that this DVD contains no Radiohead music and was done without Radiohead's approval.

I really like Radiohead and would not hesitate to buy a DVD if it was worthy.  But I feel like I was conned into this purchase and it certainly isn't worth the price.  Next time I'll be more leery of Amazon's special offers.",1224720000,13,907,4.756410256410256
8281822,1,B001B42E76,"I should have known by the title.  ""Logical Emotions"" seems like a David Brent reference from the Office with his ""juxtaposition records"".  Yin and Yang is boring, and was the first clue that this is not a Radiohead endorsed documentary.  I will buy anything Radiohead, yet I regret this purchase.  There is no music. This is a Radiohead documentary without any music by Radiohead.  Radiohead hasn't authorized this documentary.  The whole thing reminded me of watching a cheap instructional vidoe in the 7th grade.  I wish the previous review had been posted before I bought it.",1224633600,2,579,4.96875
8281823,3,B001B42E76,"I bought this thinking there were going to be some good live performances. There arent. In fact there is no original music by the band. There isn't much more info than you can get from any bio on the net. However if you are a die hard radiohead fan and want to add to your collection of radiohead dvds, do get this. :)",1224633600,4,318,4.063492063492063
