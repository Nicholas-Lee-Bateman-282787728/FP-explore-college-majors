8316108,5,B001KT61EE,Jason's excellent as usual.  Highly recommended for students wanting a good way really understand the material.,1424476800,,111,5.9375
8316109,5,B001KT61EE,"Jason Gibson is a genius!! I ordered all of his chemistry, his calculus and all of his physics!! So far I have just completed the chemistry and I have such a greater understanding because of this man.  He breaks everything down to such a simple easy to understand format. Please, Jason Gibson, come out with an organic chemistry tutor DVD set!!",1423008000,,344,4.639344262295082
8316110,5,B001KT61EE,"If you look at many of Jason's math videos you will see that I have reviewed a lot of them. I am a big believer in his video series and I truly think, as someone who was horrible at math when I was younger, that they helped me a lot. I wanted to take a little different route in this review than in some of the others partly in response to some of the comments I have seen posted about the videos.

What it is:

Just what it says, a tutor through DVD. It is Jason standing in front of a white board doing physics problems. He does a few examples of varying difficulty from each kind of problem. It is a lecture style DVD. He does not (for the most part) derive any of the formulas, he just gives you the formulas you have to use and shows you how to apply them.

It is more geared toward algebra based physics classes than those that are calculus based. Although as anyone who has taken calculus based physics can tell you, a lot of times you don't really even use calculus to solve the problems. The calculus part of the class is to show how the formulas were derived, but when you solve the problems you primarily use algebra. So, even though it will more closely resemble the lecture from a physics class that only requires algebra as a prerequisite, the principles you are learning are the same.  He does go into a little bit of calculus when describing the area under a curve in the PV diagrams, but for the most part he leaves that out.

What it is not:

It is not a rah-rah physics is great DVD. While you certainly get a sense that Jason is passionate about physics and knows his stuff, it is designed to help you learn how to do physics problems. In some of the later sets there is a review by a person who claims to be a physics teacher who was mystified that this was not a DVD to get people interested in physics. Despite the word TUTOR on the cover and the screen shots of a person in front of a white board doing problems, he was shocked to see that it was a lecture and that nobody pointed that out in a review. So, consider it pointed out.

It is not a set with the hardest problems you are likely to encounter. Many times on a test you will get compound problems that require you to solve for multiple things using the same information. It is not uncommon to get a problem split up into 6 or 7 sub parts each asking you to solve for something different. Jason does do more sub part type questions in this set than he did for the Physics I set, and there are questions that do refer you back to equations or concepts from the previous sections.  If however you are taking calculus based physics the problems you are likely to encounter will be more complex than these (at least some of them), which is why it is imperative that you do problems from your book or whatever online programs your instructor requires you to use. For example, Jason does not go into great detail with the material on adiabatic processes in this set.  He does introduce the concept and does a couple sample problems involving them, but the problems you are likely going to get assigned as homework are a lot more detailed and will require you to use other equations that Jason does not get into.  While you will come across very similar problems to what is here, your test questions are going to come from what your instructor assigns to you NOT from this DVD. If you simply relied on this for your entire preparation and skipped class and homework you will more than likely fail. Use this as a supplement.

It does also not cover every single kind of problem you will be exposed to. Most semesters are about 15 weeks long, and for a physics class you will get 4 to 5 hrs of lecture per week and at least an hour of lab. This entire DVD is 10 hours. While thermodynamics is usually touched upon for a chapter or two in first year physics, there may be details you go over in class that are not on the DVD. Some teachers just kind of breeze through it at the end of the first semester, and other teachers go through it in a fair amount of detail at the beginning of the second semester.  Whichever category your teacher falls into, this will definitely help, and give you the big picture concepts you need to know.  But that said, be smart and do not skip class, and pay attention to what is going on in class. If you use this correctly you will learn strategies for how to solve the problems, and even when you have to do something that was not covered on this DVD you will at least have an idea of how to approach it.

If used correctly this will absolutely help you, if your learning style is conducive to watching a recorded lecture. Some people learn better from one-on-one instruction. If that is you, then you would probably be better off hiring an actual tutor. But if you can learn this way, I think Jason's style of teaching is great, and he breaks down what you need to know, and provides easy to follow step-by-step instructions.",1340323200,,4932,4.277896995708154
8316111,5,B001KT61EE,"My background is in physics and chemistry, but there are certain areas (like thermodynamics) that I don't use on a continual basis. As a result, some fundamental concepts become a little ""fuzzy"" over the years. These DVDs are great for both students and professionals to familiarize (refamiliarize) themselves with fundamental concepts.

The best part about these DVDs is that they're entertaining and enjoyable.
The problems are clever, but straight forward...they definitely help reinforce the concepts.

I will certainly continue to buy more...",1234742400,3,547,5.658536585365853
8316112,5,B001KT61EE,"I bought the Physics I set and can't say enough about how Gibson teaches in these DVDs. Even as an older student, I found my professor was completely useless and I need to find my own way in succeeding with this subject (that I hate as well). Some how I stumbled on these DVDs and swear they contributed to my getting a decent B in my Physics I class. I was so beside myself when I found out there wasn't a set that covered my next semester, so I e-mail Mr. Gibson. About a day later, Jason e-mailed me back personally and told me that the second Physics set was to come out in the Fall of 2008....I needed it for my Spring 2008 class!!! Oh the horror, what was I going to do?!!  Well, I did without and got a C :(

All of you are lucky to have the whole set now - so get them - you won't be sorry and you'll improve your grade!  I wish I knew about him earlier when I had to take all my math courses.",1231977600,6,901,3.885869565217391
8316113,5,B001KT61EE,"I own the DVDs and I felt compelled to write a review. I was stunned by the great quality of the presentation and of the author's profound knowledge in what he teaches.

Definitelly an excellent and wise purchace for those who are interested in the subject.",1228521600,7,257,4.586956521739131
8316114,5,B001KT61EE,"I'm a 59 year old Ph. D. in physicist with my own very successful research corporation. But what has bothered me throughout the past 30 years is how much I forgot due to non-use; or worse yet, what I did not take the time to learn properly due to academic work load, life problems, or pressures of one kind or another.

Well, after I discovered Mr. Gibson's DVD series in math and physics, I set myself to a course of completely reviewing all of my undergrad physics and math; if for no other reason, than to `feel' like a `complete' physicist. Literally, I bought every one of his DVDs (except for some on basic math) and am here to say that in my opinion, there is nothing like them anywhere; and especially, in universities today. These DVDs approach the subject matter in a pedagogical and not phenomenological way. Meaning, you learn by example, and hence have an immediate grasp of the principles which can then be applied to more sophisticated problems. I especially recommend all of his math DVDs from algebra up through advanced calculus, and his thermodynamics course (to date).

If you want to LEARN what math and physics are really about, and how to use them to solve serious, high level ground breaking physical problems, then I STRONGLY suggest that you get these DVDs. Textbooks are one thing. They purport to `teach' you the necessary theory and then apply it to practical applications. But I have to tell you that even when I was at university in the 1960s I never found this to be the case. It was as if the authors of those books were more in love with their own knowledge and intent on impressing young students with that knowledge, than they were in teaching a given discipline. And they cloaked this `approach' under that most infamous of phrases, ""...what we give here is a rigorous approach to the subject..."" To be sure, ""rigor"" is necessary - but ONLY AFTER you understand the principles and KNOW how to apply them to real world problems.

Today, it's the opposite: physics AND math texts look like cartoon books - the pictures, illustrations, graphs, even the `blocked out' equations appear in so many colors, one gets dizzy just flipping through the pages. Not to mention their overstating and overstating the obvious to such an extent, that they confuse even the simplest of physical concepts.

As it was decades ago, if you want to survive your academic `experience' and graduate, you'd better take your life in your own hands and do what needs to be done. Not just to `pass' your math and physics courses, but to UNDERSTAND them and the math that lies behind them. And in my opinion, the ONLY way to accomplish this is through these DVDs (I also STRONGLY recommend that you use the Problem Solver series as well for more advanced problems, since they give step by step solutions. Forget about the Schaums: as a rule, their authors are still trying to `impress' the reader with what they know instead of providing a reasonably complete - not extensive - outline of the subject matter and then give graded levels of problems so the student can apply the theory to those problems. This is what they `say' they are intended to do. I have never found that to be the case. Rather, their presenting a disorganized mlange of material is more to the point. Remember: just because a book is popular, doesn't mean it is the best, or even that it/they do the job they say they do.)

In short, study these DVDs FIRST, and do ALL problems that Mr. Gibson gives in those DVDs. Second, study the corresponding sections in your class textbook, and work all relevant problems there. And THIRD, work ALL similar problems in a corresponding Problem Solver. Do this, and you will not only pass your exams with flying colors, you will actually UNDERSTAND WHAT you are doing, and WHY you are doing it. Now, wouldn't that be refreshing?",1228003200,36,3843,4.662241887905605
