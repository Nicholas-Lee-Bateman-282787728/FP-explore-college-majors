2001545,4,B0001HAGTM,"i bought it to complete my reference of the old horror movies

Some are so great and chillin' i.e : Carnival of Souls, Dementia 13, Little Shop of Horror, Nosferatu & House on Haunted Hill

you see it's kinda hard to catch those movies in where i live (south east asian region, Indonesia for exact)

this boxset is the superb answer . . not to mention the reasonable prices too (of course it's cheap, coz it's made in taiwan)

but the 'easily scratched' double-sided dvd needs extra care

Very Recommended (8/10)",1106611200,14,512,4.582417582417582
2001546,4,B0001HAGTM,"I love old horror films. ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""The Wolfman,"" ""The Invisible Man,"" ""The Mummy,"" ""The Creature,"" etc. Now, you're not going to get quality horror on this set like those films. But the films on this set are not that bad. In fact, if you like old horror or mystery films, this set proves to be quite entertaining.

Not all the films on this set are horror. Many films are included simply because they star actors who typically act in horror films. Films like ""The Bat"" with Vincent Price, or ""One Body Too Many"" with Bela Lugosi aren't really horrific at all. They're more murder mysteries than horror films. But that's ok because they're still good films.

I love Metropolis, although I don't know why it's is on this set and not the 50 Movie Sci-Fi Classics set. Also, the print quality for this film is terrible. The same goes for Nosferatu. For great films like these two, I recommend buying their restored versions as well, even though they're on this set.

For what you're paying, this set is well worth the price. Every film I've watched has been at least somewhat entertaining. So if you like old cheesy horror films, this is the set for you!",1105315200,14,1168,4.632850241545894
2001547,4,B0001HAGTM,Then buy this! And CHEAP TOO!!!!! Seriously it's a great bargain for some laughs and thrills.,1100822400,4,93,4.875
2001548,3,B0001HAGTM,"To be concise and summarize - Great value!  50 movies (I paid about 25 bucks; so 50 cent movies - how can you complain?)

Transfer quality generally awful, most but not all are slightly out of focus (won't notice on little tv!) but watchable.  If you are a perfectionist you will not want this.  Some scenes from some movies have been cut but nothing major so far (have seen maybe 26-27 so far).  Sound generally poor, mono, (2 were in stereo).  The B&W movies generally not so bad but many of the color films have serious quality problems IMHO.  All are full screen; no wide-screen (that I have seen).  This is OK since all movies before 1954 were approx. FF anyway.  The ideal customer wants a sample of the 20's-60's Horror/Mystery/Action B movies with 3-4 real classics and 15+ total duds.  Still, fantastic value.  Absolutely no frills.  All movies have small number of selectable scenes, no trailers or ANY other stuff.  Packaging is 12 d/s single layer disks each in cardboard cd-type sleeve.  None of the disks in my box was scratched (maybe lucky?).",1092700800,328,1058,4.679347826086956
2001549,5,B0001HAGTM,"I purchased this 50 DVD box set this past autumn (for Halloween) and have viewed all of the films.  There are some GREAT CLASSICS mixed with fabulous SCHLOCK for a price that can't be beat!
Different horror genres including:
Crusty, Creepy Creatures
Descend to the depths of the deep, dark ocean and encounter the ""Phantom From 10,000 Leagues"" and ""Creature From The Haunted Sea"". Check out the cheesy and quite primitive special effects in ""The Giant Gila Monster"". Rediscover terror of dogs dressed up in fur playing ""The Killer Shrews"". Hold your breath to see which hick from the backwoods will actually survive ""The Attack of the Giant Leeches""! Also the great ""The Hunchback Of Notre Dame"" with the fabulous Lon Chaney, Jr., ""The Gorilla"", ""Swamp Women"", ""Atom Age Vampire"", ""Beast Of yucca Flats"", ""Black Dragons"", ""Invisible Ghost"", ""The Vampire Bat"" with Fay Wray, ""White Zombie"" with Bela Lugosi and ""The Bat"" With Vincent Price!
Majorly Maddening Madmen
Descend into insanity and weird funereal rites in Francis Ford Coppola's first full-length feature ""Dementia 13"". Be astounded at the scientific perversity of Jason Evers as he keeps the severed head of his fiance alive in ""The Brain that Wouldn't Die"". Also includes, ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"", ""The Monster Maker"", ""Maniac"", ""The Amazing Mr. X"", ""The Tormented"", and ""Bluebeard"".
Cult Classics
Watch when Audrey II cries ""feeeed me"" in ""Little Shop of Horrors"". Fear for the fate of humanity as flesh-eating zombies roam the earth in Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"". Find out what it's like to be ""The Last Man on Earth"" with Vincent Price and ""The Last Woman On Earth"" with Robert Towne. Go to the ""Carnival Of Souls"" with Candace Hilligoss, even!

Silent Horror Classics
Watch the amazing Lon Chaney in ""Phantom of the Opera"", slinking through the cellars of the Paris Opera House. Marvel at the chilling Max Schreck in ""Nosferatu"", giving a truly mesmerizing performance and the classic and futuristic, ""Metropolis"".
AND MUCH, MUCH MORE!  I highly recommend this very cool and inexpensive box set for anyone who likes classic horror, cheesy schlock, Bela Lugosi or  stylings of the great Ed Wood!
Happy Watching!",1085875200,389,2184,5.075208913649025
2001550,5,B0001HAGTM,"These movies were barely B-Classic...they were cheap Drive-In flicks, and later, showed late late night under banners such as Fright Night or Chamber of Horrors; not even Elvira would show these puppies.  But they are great fun.  I love these old B&W films, they have a class all their own.  They are neatly organized so you will find the titles quickly, and have something for everyone.
I have the 50 Pack of Old Mysteries and the one of Sci-Fi...they are just great ways to packages these old movies you thought you'd never see again.",1083542400,21,536,4.680851063829787
2001551,3,B0001HAGTM,"First off, I have not seen all 50 movies, only about 28 so far. But I have some opinions on this package already. The movies come on 12 double-sided DVDs with the contents clearly marked on the inner ring of each disc.  Each DVD comes in a cardboard sleeve with the movie's description printed on it. The menus are basic, scene selection is awkward but if you just want to watch the whole movie, it works fine.  The quality of the picture and sound vary considerably.  Some of the movies are a bit blurry with muddy sound and some missing frames, but all were watchable to me.  Some of the movies are outstandingly clear both in picture and sound, such as 'Beast of Yucca Flats' (which may be the worst movie I have ever seen).
The silent movies have a musical soundtrack, but it doesn't really go with the action.  ""Doctor Jekyll & Mr. Hyde', for instance, sounds like someone put a Bach organ recital CD on and just let it play. I don't understand why 'Metropolis' was included in a horror package, but it's a good movie.
I know I sound as if I didn't like this set, but I have found it very entertaining and there is more variety to the selections than I expected.  There are some real standouts, such as 'Carnival of Souls' that make this set worthwhile if you are of a mind to enjoy old movies.
I rated it three stars because the quality of the transfers could be improved on quite a bit; but really if you factor in the price, it is an enormous bargain. I plan to get several of the other 50 movie sets.",1082937600,67,1509,4.295774647887324

2001573,5,B0001HAGTM,"I bought this a long time ago. I love some of these movies that can be found no where else. Then there are real stinkers. Over all it is very entertaining and it is easy to mark the ones you like and just watch those.
I originally bought it for a family gathering around Halloween. the power went out that night and we wound up playing Yahtzee by candle light. So I got to watch many of these at times when I was home sick or otherwise had time to just enjoy them. I often critque them out loud like Science fiction theater 2000.
In our family we are fans of B movies and some of these might even make the ""Z"" list . LOL

Bottom line is it is worth the money and 50 movies give you hours of viewing. Might be great for grandparents to have on hand for the young ones. Watch first to be sure they are appropriate because some are a little risqu.",1516924800,,844,4.023809523809524

My recommendation is that when you get the set, go through and pull out each disc, read the titles (which are at least printed in teeny tiny letters on the inner circle of the discs), and write up an index for yourself, so you don't go crazy every time you want to watch a movie, and take longer to find the movie than to watch it.",1477267200,18,672,4.06015037593985

Hey! This is before they had dolby, hi-fi and all that! I assume most of the negative reviews come from younger folks who were raised on HD TV! I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies! Sure there are a few places where there might have been a film splice, or the sound may be less than 2015 standards, but it's nothing that's really going to bother anyone except for the spoiled younger generation!

Like ""The Bat"", a predictable but fun whodunit crime movie. Of course there is the classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" in its hundredths or so version.

2001936,3,B0001HAGTM,"This contains many horror films in the pubic domain.  The movies range from the 1920s all the way to the 1960s so there's no fear of running into any horror film from the 2000s in this pack.  One thing I don't like about this is the 12 discs are put into envelopes rather than slipped on plastic.  However, considering the fact it contains 12 discs, it may have been difficult to put plastic inside the box, so it's forgivable.

Update: I've been watching one movie a day since Oct 1 all the way to Halloween and it turns out that some of these shouldn't even count as horror films at all.  For instance, The Fatal Hour feels like just a detective movie and has no feeling of horror for me.  The closest thing this movie had to horror was it had Boris Karloff in it.  Also, because this has fifty movies, there's a good chance there's going to be movies in it you won't like.  I disliked the Beast of Yucca Flats because of the narrator talking when he's not even needed.

Overall, this is a very great way to expand your library at very little cost.  If you love classic horror films, I would recommend this boxset.",1405123200,4,1116,4.322115384615385

Other folks who have posted before me have done a fine job summarizing what you get, so i won't go there, since they already did.  I will say that this is more than well worth the price.

Yes, I love horror.
Yes, I love classics.
Yes, I love 'B' movies (the '80s were a banner decade for me).
The quality is, of course, not remastered Blu-Ray or anything close but it is still very good for the price and the number of awesome films you get in this collection. If there is a film you love from this collection (Nosferatu and Night of the Living Dead quickly come to mind) then buy those specific films by themselves in a remastered version but I would still add this pack of films to your collection.
The packaging is eh, sub-par but once again it's uber-cheap for all of the films you get. The films come in a nice giant box (as pictured) with each double-sided DVD in separate paper holders.
Overall, I love this set and would recommend it",1398211200,,1018,4.335078534031414

This is great for starting a collection of classics or to make an easy addition to an existing collection. Great value. Lugosi, Karloff, Lon Chaney Sr & Jr, Vincent Price, Turhan Bey & even Jack Nicholson. Like having the ""history of horror"" in a box. Stretching back from the early 1920's & ending with what I consider the last of the classic horror flicks: Night of the living dead 1968.

2001955,5,B0001HAGTM,"This is probably one of Mill Creek Entertainment's best 50 packs. There are a lot of great movies in this set spanning several decades of frightful moviemaking! All of the original top horror icons are included: Both Lon Chaney's, Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Vincent Price, and more! This collection is a wonderful mix of early, eerie, silent films like ""Nosferatu"", Metropolis"", and ""Phantom Of The Opera"".
Frightening cult favorites like ""White Zombie"", ""Night Of The Living Dead"", and ""Carnival Of Souls"" are here as well. Campy films like ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""Maniac"", and ""The Brain That Wouldn`t Die"" are also included. These titles are all in the public domain, none of the films have been restored, and like most of Mill Creek`s offerings the video quality is generally good.

I guess the bottom line is - it's entertaining, it's a good price, and if you're into old horror movies, you'll be pleased.",1391990400,,430,4.597402597402597
2001977,3,B0001HAGTM,"I bought this horror 50 movie pack a few years ago at a price of $10.00(MINE HAS A DIFFERENT COVER WITH AN UP SHADOW PICTURE OF A GREEN GHOULS FACE ON IT). Of course I wasn't expecting great quality, but hoped for the best. Considering my purchase price of 5 films for a dollar, I wasn't too disappointed, but I wasn't sure if visual and audio quality would make a difference in your entertainment experience. Let me tell you, quality does make a difference!

On first look the prints look pretty good, but when you compare them to better ones, then you can see what you are missing. Many of these films are available in much better editions, but you will pay a premium price(in comparison to this set) for the upgrade. Some of the films may be missing bits of film and or scratches, dark images and general wear. The audio is OK at best, but most of these cheap films had terrible sound anyway.

I DO recommend this set because it is a very inexpensive way to see whether any of these films are worth the space they will take on your video library shelf. Please bare in mind that seeing films that may be slightly edited(in some cases), having some scenes too dark to see or audio that is less than desirable can make a difference in your viewing pleasure and ultimate opinion of these films.

While some of these films may not be available in any better condition, many have very impressive restoration releases.
My ratings' for the video quality is forgiving as a lot of these films have only been available as unrestored prints that are washed out , edited and battered. Mostly everything here falls between 2 - stars and 2 + stars.

Otto dollari e novanta-sei centesimi. Acht Dollar und neunzig-sechs Cent. No, you will not get stellar transfer and sound quality. You will not get the best packaging. You are paying EIGHT DOLLARS AND NINETY-SIX CENTS for FiFTY movies.

So, if you can deal with real-world economics and you love classic horror and camp, then make a bowl of popcorn and come grab a spot on the couch...

.... because this collection is a loads of fun. It includes movies you may remember from late-night ""chiller theater"", like The House on Haunted Hill, The Screaming Skull and The Terror. There are hilarious cinematic trainwrecks like The Beast of Yucca Flats. Some drive-in fun like Attack Of The Giant Leeches. Lighter mysteries like One Body Too Many and The Bat, and more serious mysteries like The Amazing Mr. X and Black Dragons. And then there are classics that if you haven't seen, make this whole collection worthwhile, like White Zombie, Phantom of The Opera and Nosferatu. Throw in some cult fun like Dementia 13 and Carnival of Souls, and what more could you possibly want?

There are some misses, for sure. But c'mon, you've got fifty to choose from. I suggest if you're not familiar with these titles then use this collection as a ""jumping off"" point - if you are impressed with some then you'll know which ones to buy in better quality. I also love having all these in one box set because it makes it easy to pack for a weekend at the cabin - nothing like a cup of hot cocoa and a classic horror movie marathon on a rainy afternoon.

2002060,3,B0001HAGTM,"Most of these movies are pretty bad; the audio and video.  These are no doubt copies of bad copies, and no effort has been made to improve the quality.  Most of the plots are time-worn, or outright ... dumb.  One of them, ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"", has almost no dialog, just narration.  (Guess they pay actors less if they don't have a speaking part.)  However - it does have some classic movies included: The Phanton of the Opera, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Nosfertu - all in the original, silent versions.  Plus, two horror movies with Jack Nicholson.  There are also some movies that are not horror stories - just mysteries.  All in all, I'd say it's worth the price, just for a few gems included.  Really - where can you get 50 movies for $12.",1373760000,,776,4.408450704225352

So that makes it even better for a real horror films lover. It comes in a very solid case with 12 CDs inside with paper case. Two sided disks. With a nice review of each film. The package was very well protected and came intact! I would definitely recommend this if you really are into classics. I personally like the old look in the video so I don't care much about quality when it comes to B&W classics. Overall, its worth every penny and I'm happy with this.",1370476800,,593,4.4

2002081,4,B0001HAGTM,"This is a great general survey of the genre, from the 'A' budget silents ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera""  to indie cult faves ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Carnival of Souls.""  If the name Forrest J. Ackerman means anything to you, there are a number of quirky, even obscure small studio 'B's' and indies in this compilation to keep you busy for days.  But for the less than die-hard afficionado, there are several which are eminently skippable.

Generally the print quality is acceptable, but not sterling, particularly the older films, and don't bear up in comparison to versions that have been painstakingly restored (like the expressionist classic ""Nosferatu""). But of course these are only available for top dollar.  And for background, you're going to need Wikipedia at least...there are no notes accompanying these films.",1364428800,,859,5.0638297872340425

Some of the films in this set might be considered part of the mystery genre rather than horror, but nevertheless, they are still very entertaining. The films in this collection come on 12 double-sided discs, and there is also a guide that gives information about each movie, including a brief summary of the plot and what DVD the movie is located on, which is a very convenient feature.

I've read previous scathing comments about this collection regarding the ""lameness"" and poor picture quality of some of the films, and completely disagree. Some of them are quite old, hence the poor picture quality... with films that old, that's what you get, it's part of the charm! Some other commenters have also mentioned that the music doesn't seem to go with the actual film... the music isn't added later to the silent films, it is written specifically for that film. It seems to me that people who are unhappy with this collection just simply don't like the types of movies on it. Even if you aren't thrilled with every single movie, there are plenty more to choose from. If you truly enjoy the old classics, then this set is for you.",1363219200,,798,4.510344827586207

If you love the old vampire films and spooky graveyards at night, this is a great collection for you.

The audio quality on many of the movies is muffled and very poor; as though the movie is a copy of a copy.

The DVDs come in sleeves that can be stacked inside the case- I would much prefer something sturdier, but for the price this collection is fantastic.

Not a big deal- you can still read all the text. Comes with a little booklet giving a synopsis of each movie.

Some have been used as Mst3k films, others are just so old that they were classics before they had classics. These are seriously great films if you love b-movies. The case is just a large plastic box case and inside the DVDs are in paper slip packages held in a square. The DVDs are double sided and each slip package has the films and a short description of them on both sides. The edges of the slips get crinkled quickly but that does no harm to the DVDs so no harm no foul.

2002122,5,B0001HAGTM,"This is a fantastic collection of B-movies, schlock horror and odd cinematic classics. Some of these films were staples of late night horror movie shows, while others were parodied on Mystery Science Theater 3000 a decade or two ago.  There are a few really fine films here, like Carnival of Souls (1962) White Zombie (1932), Metropolis (1927), Dr. Jekyll and Mr, Hyde (1920, with John Barrymore), The Phantom of the Opera (1925) and Nosferatu (1922) and The Last Man on Earth (1960, the basis for I Am Legend). The are also some incredible awful but really fun-to-watch films like The Indestructible Man, Attack of the Giant Leeches, Swamp Women and the Beast of Yucca Flats. But there are really very few complete duds in this collection, and for the money, it is a tremendous value.

The quality of the prints is somewhat variable; these DVDs haven't been produced from restored negatives but probably from 16MM prints, but they are all very watchable. The booklet and package are no-frills, with the most annoying thing being how difficult it is to tell one DVD from the next. The discs are in individual, unlabeled envelopes, and each disk has the disk number and movie titles listed in print almost too small to read). Still, for fans of B-movies, this collection is highly recommended.",1356480000,,1292,4.868181818181818

2002130,4,B0001HAGTM,"My copy is the one with Lon Chaney as The Phantom of the Opera on the cover. This one has 12 double-sided discs with about 4 movies on each one. They are in black paper sleeves. The disc menus are simple. Two films per side of the disc, and display a screenshot of the title of the movie. The options are ""play movie"" and ""scene selection"". No special features, however.

So far I've watched White Zombie and House on Haunted Hill. The picture quality ranges from slightly blurred in older films (1920's specifically) to fairly good, given the time periods many of these were shot in. House on Haunted Hill looks great! Widescreen wasn't really a thing back in the days of classic horror, so you won't find that here. The sound quality is fine. Not remastered or anything, but that doesn't bother me. You can't beat the original, right? You might have to turn up the volume a little on quieter movies. The movies look fine and are quite watchable on my 32"" flat screen.

These discs do play on the Xbox 360! I was a little worried they wouldn't but they start up and play just fine.

There is also a guide included with the volumes, a little booklet with the disc number and side each movie is contained on, and even includes a cast list, year of release, and small description of each movie. A nice touch for those who haven't seen every single movie in the collection ;) At the back of the booklet is a quick-reference index in alphabetical order.

My only qualms about it are that I wish there were more Vincent Price films, such as House of Wax and the Poe films he starred in. The paper sleeves can also be a little hard to remove from the case, but if you're gentle with them they come right out.

I like this collection. It makes a nice addition to my shelf and compacts all the movies together instead of taking up a lot of space. The only film I own from this collection specifically is Phantom of the Opera, a cheap $5 DVD I bought from a video store.",1352678400,10,1961,4.3469945355191255

Many of the movies here are really bad, but a movie doesn't have to be good to be a classic or even to enjoy it.

The collection by Mill Creek also brings together classics like Phantom of the Opera, Nosferatu, White Zombie, The Huntchback of Notredame, Night of the Living Dead and many others. Where else could you find Bela Lugosi, Boris Karlof, Lon Chaney and Vincent Price in the same Disc Case?!

If really like Horror Movies, this collection is for you.

I'm bit by bit getting the individual dvd's of the movies in this collection as they come out (special editions at least), and by the time this happens (if it happens at all - Dementia 13 Special Edition? Don't think so) I'll still keep this collection with consideration in my dvdshelf.",1330819200,2,1011,4.594444444444444
2002162,5,B0001HAGTM,"For the money, ""Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection"", was a great purchase. Most of these are not the blockbuster horror flix from the 50s and 60s. There are some classics like Metropolis. They have not been digitally remastered. By todays standards, the story lines and special effects are pretty week. But what are you expecting, getting 50 movies for only $10? The picture/sound quality reminds me of being back at a drive in movie, and I think that's great! I pop these movies in to watch while I'm working out on my exercise bike. I love old horror flicks, no matter how corny or predictable they might be. Some of these are foreign language, that have been dubbed with English. As long as I don't have to read subtitles, I'm good with that also.",1330560000,2,756,4.607407407407408

To me, it's also kinda nice to see the picture and sound showing the age that these films really have. Sometimes, a classic should be seen as such. It's historic. Easily 5 stars for me after paying only 15 bucks.",1326499200,2,494,4.040816326530612

2002167,5,B0001HAGTM,"I've watched several of these 50 movie collections from Millcreek and so far this one has been the most enjoyable. Now before I go on, I want to give a little warning to the uninitiated..These are VERY old movies and the picture quality is NOT very good. These types of movies are usually enjoyed by a small niche crowd. With that being said, if you do enjoy some of the better known movies in this collection(such as the silent classic Metropolis), there might be several cleaned up DVD(or even Blu-ray) releases with special features.

Many of the movies in this 12-disc collection(dual-sided DVD's) are not strictly 'Horror'. Some could be categorized as 'crime-drama' or 'suspense' or even 'sci-fi'. Needless to say, this collection contains some of the better well-known cult classics such as 'Night of the Living Dead', 'The Phantom of the Opera', 'Nosferatu', and 'Dr Jehkyll & Mr Hyde'. As I mentioned before, the visual quality of these copies are not very good, but still watchable(in my opinion).

Other movies in this collection I really enjoyed include: 'The Brain that Wouldn't Die', 'Bloodlust'(with Brady dad Robert Reed), 'The Terror'(with a young Jack Nicholson), and 'The Corpse Vanishes'. Also be on the lookout for Little Rascal's 'Darla Hood' all grown up in 'The Bat' featuring Vincent Price. Most of these movies are from the 20's-40's(in B&W) and a few are silent movies. Only 'The Terror'(1963) and 'Monster from a Pre-Historic Planet'(1967) are in color.",1319155200,6,1481,5.065573770491803

2002169,4,B0001HAGTM,This collection was truly full of great horror classics.  The silent movies to the talkies and on were wonderful to view.  The arrangement of the film gave you a contrast between the silent and the newer films.  It is an awsome collection.  A must have for the horror film collector.,1318723200,4,283,4.6
2002180,4,B0001HAGTM,"Let's be honest, Mill Creek products are not great. It isn't any skill to schlock a bunch of public domain movies onto DVD. The video quality is shoddy--they didn't do any restoration. The audio quality is pathetic--you gotta crank that volume! No special features, no subtitles (would would have been nice considering the audio issues.)

And yet... this is still a great set. These are old movies, so we don't expect them to look great. And there are some GREAT titles here which make this budget release a great value. The obvious bona-fide classic is Nosferatu, the silent film classic feature the fabulous performance by Max Schreck. But there is also brilliant films like The Little Shop of Horrors, The House on Haunted Hill, Carnival of Souls, The Last Man on Earth, and Metropolis. Oh, and I dare not forget The Night of the Living Dead.

Really, for a collection like this that is a pretty decent percentage of awesome.

The rest of it varies between the ridiculous, the interesting, and the ridiculously awesome. Part of the fun is going through wondering if you'll find a hidden gem--for example, I really enjoyed The Creature From the Haunted Sea. Sure, it puts a genre element (haunted) in the title that actually never happens in the movie (no ghosts or spirits to be found), but it is just schlocky fun.

Then... there are some terrible movies. But I suspect that these will vary depending on the person... and even if 1-in-4 falls into the ""terrible"" category, the collection is worthwhile.

So yeah. Know what you're getting and you won't be disappointed.
(That said, I will JUMP at the chance if any of the ones I like come out on restored blu-ray. As far as I know, the only one actually out on blu-ray is Metropolis--which I already own and, considering it is the most complete version of Metropolis available, I highly recommend said blu-ray.)",1315785600,7,1864,4.77639751552795

2002187,3,B0001HAGTM,"I bought this horror 50 movie pack a few years ago at a price of $10.00(MINE HAS A DIFFERENT COVER WITH AN UP SHADOW PICTURE OF A GREEN GHOULS FACE ON IT). Of course I wasn't expecting great quality, but hoped for the best. Considering my purchase price of 5 films for a dollar, I wasn't too disappointed, but I wasn't sure if visual and audio quality would make a difference in your entertainment experience. Let me tell you, quality does make a difference!

On first look the prints look pretty good, but when you compare them to better ones, then you can see what you are missing. Many of these films are available in much better editions, but you will pay a premium price(in comparison to this set) for the upgrade. Some of the films may be missing bits of film and or scratches, dark images and general wear. The audio is OK at best, but most of these cheap films had terrible sound anyway.

I DO recommend this set because it is a very inexpensive way to see whether any of these films are worth the space they will take on your video library shelf. Please bare in mind that seeing films that may be slightly edited(in some cases), having some scenes too dark to see or audio that is less than desirable can make a difference in your viewing pleasure and ultimate opinion of these films.

While some of these films may not be available in any better condition, many have very impressive restoration releases.
My ratings' for the video quality is forgiving as a lot of these films have only been available as unrestored prints that are washed out , edited and battered. Mostly everything here falls between 2 - stars and 2 + stars.

2002200,4,B0001HAGTM,"Obviously there are a lot of consumers having trouble appreciating this 'Horror Classics' movie pack in today's HD world. I don't know what these people were expecting from this product, but going by the way they judged it, I shall say their expectations were not very realistic.

This pack is perfect for b-movie and retro horror lovers. It provides you with raw Roger Corman classics and other less than epic old -and even some silent- horror features. Keep in mind that old horror and modern horror are as different as day and night, and don't make the same mistake some serious duh faces did of expecting movies along the lines of 'The Ring' or 'The Devil's Rejects.' This ain't no pack for slasher lover either, so make sure to at least read the titles of the movies you are buying before you regret doing it and come back here whining about how ""boring"" these movies are -just because they're not your cup of tea.

Get this if you enjoy old movies and silent films, not if you're after seat-jumpers. People complained about the video/sound quality of most of the movies and the truth is the quality ain't that good. The version you get of 'The Little Shop of Horrors' can't even be compared to the remastered/restored in-color version released in 2008. While the former is a raw digital copy of the original grainy film, the later's been digitally retouched to enhance the appearence of the movie. I have to say that personally I prefer the non-restored version that this pack offers, for it stays more faithful to the original version people saw in theaters back in 1960. If you are HD freak, you can get the restored version, but it'll cost you half of what this 50-movie pack costs.",1300320000,2,1691,4.6521739130434785

While most of them can be considered horror if the term is applied loosely with the standard monster movie fare, some of these movies are science fiction and others are detective stories and murder mysteries.  The collection covers everything from genuine classics (Night of the Living Dead, Nosferatu, a butchered version of Metropolis, Hunchback of Notre Dame) to enjoyable B movies (White Zombie) to movies that are considered among the worst ever made (The Beast of Yucca Flatts).  Included are 4 movies staring Boris Karloff, 3 with Vincent Price, 5 or so with Bela Lugosi, 2 with Lon Chaney Sr, and 2 with Jack Nicholson.  Approximately 4 of the movies are silent films, and only 2 of them are in color.

BORING CRAP:  The Ape, The Giant Gila Monster, Little Shop of Horrors, The Monster Maker.

SO GOD-AWFUL TERRIBLE YOU HAVE TO SEE IT:  Attack of the Giant Leeches, The Beast of Yucca Flats, Monster From a Prehistoric Planet.

So many of these films were Drive-in Movie fodder, time-filler for necking teenaged couples during the 1950s and '60s and, on most of those movies in particular, I have reserved comment as they are all pretty much what you'd expect.

I thought that the best approach to be helpful to potential buyers of this collection was to issue both a brief comment and a 1-10 ranking on the better films in the set, so here goes:

-- Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, starring John Barrymore [8.0, a classic version of an excellent story. A physician with a definite *split personality* has to come to terms with his monster side.]

--Blue Beard, starring John Carradine

-- The Corpse Vanishes, starring Bela Lugosi [6.5, not one of Lugosi's better efforts but still watchable. Lugosi keeps his evil wife alive via injections after draining the spinal fluids of young brides-to-be and thereby deriving a fountain of youth serum. An attractive lady newspaper reporter investigates the abductions and thus places herself in mortal danger. Black-and-white.]

-- Night of the Living Dead, starring Judith O'Dea [7.0, Lots of action! The good news about The Walking Dead is that they fall pretty readily to ball bats, etc... the down side is that there seems no end to their vast numbers and re-snuffing them becomes very tiring and monotonous.]

-- Doomed to Die, starring Boris Karloff

-- The Phantom of the Opera, starring Lon Chaney, Sr. [7.0, Best for *film art* people who can appreciate a well-done classic film. This one is more *noir* than scary.]

-- The Indestructible Man, starring Lon Chaney, Jr. [7.5, I really liked this one -- Chaney plays out his traditional, ""Whomever got me into this deplorable mess?"" sympathetic role. As it turns out, and as one would reasonably expect, he's not really *totally* indestructible :) ]

-- The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Lon Chaney, Sr. [7.5, Again we have the classic work of film art, nicely re-packaged from great literature. The elder Chaney is seen here in his Magnum opus role and the film is quite enjoyable, even by today's standards.]

-- Nosferatu, starring Max Schreck [8.0, More film art. Here we have the first vampire movie, a silent film but still quite watchable much on par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golem/dp/B00006L90Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golem</a>. The vampire here, although super-creepy, is quite the sympathetic creature. A very good movie overall.]

-- Swamp Women, starring Mike Connors

-- The World Gone Mad, starring Pat O'Brien

-- The Little Shop of Horrors, starring Jack Nicholson [7.0, If ever there was a *cult film* from the git-go, this one is it. A gigantic flesh-eating plant dominates his diminutive caretaker in a flower shop. The plant *demands* more and more people to eat! Lots of inadvertent comedy relief. The musical re-make was awful. If you wish to see a more serious, and quite excellent, man-eating plant color letterbox film, (and additionally punctuated with a King Kong look-alike!), grab a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Konga/dp/B000BITV0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Konga</a>.]

-- Tormented, starring Richard Carlson

-- The Monster Walks, starring Rex Lease

-- Monster from a Prehistoric Planet, starring Tamio Kawaji

-- The Gorilla, starring The Ritz Brothers [3.0, The shame of this allegedly comedic horror film is that both The Ritz Brothers (who are not humorous in the least) and a very weak script tenon to drag down two iconic actors of the horror film genre: Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi. Important men are threatened with death by a rogue gorilla and The Ritz Brothers as private detectives are hired to protect one such man (Atwill.) Lugosi plays the ominous butler. From my view, this film isn't worth the time it takes to watch it.]

-- A Shriek in the Night, starring Ginger Rogers

-- Bloodlust, starring Robert Reed

-- The Amazing Mr. X, starring Turhan Bay

-- Last Woman on Earth, starring Robert Towne

-- The Bat, starring Vincent Price [8.0, A terrific Vincent Price entry, not to be confused with Lugosi's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Devil-Bat/dp/B00006AUGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Devil Bat</a>.]

-- The House on Haunted Hill, starring Vincent Price [9.5, Possibly my favorite black-and-white classic horror film of all time -- a genuine treasure. A party is sponsored within the sturdy walls of a large and ominous (but fairly new) haunted house where the invitees each get $10,000 if they *survive* the night. The casting is perfect, the cinematography is superb, the script is a strong one, the atmosphere is timeless, Von Dexter's 60-ish filmscore is spot-on, and Price is amazing. Elisha Cook, Jr. is a marvelous foil to the old Master of horror. But don't waste your money on watching the contemporary re-make.]

-- The Last Man on Earth, starring Vincent Price [6.5, This one is a sort of black-and-white prequel to the more contemporary color&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omega-Man/dp/B000P0J0BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omega Man</a>&nbsp;(starring Charlton Heston.) Both films are equally excellent where one man remains as the last normal human on earth. Mutant monsters (former humans) torment these respective lone survivors.]

-- Dementia 13, starring William Campbell [9.0, Yet another superb black-and-white cult film, co-starring Patrick McGee as an ominous psychiatrist. William Campbell yields a stellar performance as an eccentric artist, competing with greedy siblings and in-laws for the family fortune and ancient castle estate. One of them is an ax-murderer! A Roger Corman and Francis Ford Coppolla (black-and-white) film of infinite excellence.]

-- Phantom from 10,000 Leagues, starring Kent Taylor

-- Carnival of Souls, starring Candace Hilligoss [7.5, An unusual movie, leaning more toward the film-noir genre. Very well-done, though -- also available in a nice 4-film package from American Movie Classics:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AMC-Monsterfest-Collection-Cult-Classics-Vol-1-The-Atomic-Brain-The-Brain-That-Wouldn-t-Die-Carnival-of-Souls-Night-Tide/dp/B0000JCFOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AMC Monsterfest Collection - Cult Classics, Vol. 1 (The Atomic Brain / The Brain That Wouldn't Die / Carnival of Souls / Night Tide)</a>.]

-- Atom Age Vampire, starring Alberto Lupo

-- Creature from the Haunted Sea, starring Robert Towne [5.0, While this one has somehow hung on as a cult classic, I have never cared much for it, the cool creature excepted.]

-- Nightmare Castle, starring Barbara Steele [6.5, Here we have Barbara Steele's (the purported ""Queen of Horror"") Magnum opus. I like the film because how can you go wrong with the horror-castle combination? The story revolves around a cuckold man and his greedy companion, not unsurprisingly where the sensual Ms. Steele was involved.]

-- Black Dragons, starring Bela Lugosi

-- Invisible Ghost, starring Bela Lugosi [8.0, One of my favorite Lugosi films. An innocent man is convicted and executed for murders occurring in and around an eccentric local aristocrat's (Lugosi's) estate. Lugosi keeps seeing his supposedly dead wife around the property which is driving him nuts. Clarence Muse (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes-in-Washington/dp/B0000APVBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes in Washington</a>) as the butler yields a timeless performance. Black-and-white.]

-- One Body Too Many, starring Bela Lugosi

-- White Zombie, starring Bela Lugosi [7.0, This is a really early Lugosi entry and a good one too. Exotic locations, voodoo, and an evil local squire of a vast estate (who lusts for another man's young bride-to-be) all meld to make this story one of the best in the classic horror genre.]

-- Attack of the Giant Leeches, starring Ken Clark [6.5, You'll remain tongue-in-cheek while watching this classic black-and-white horror entry. Swamp people are at risk from some really hilarious over-sized leech creatures who love to suck their blood -- think:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blob-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00004W3HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blob - Criterion Collection</a>. The local game warden, the sheriff, and a sage old doctor have difficulty in coming together to defeat these fantastic critters.]

-- The Screaming Skull, starring John Hudson

-- Beast of Yucca Flats, starring Tor Johnson [5.5, An obese and deathly-looking Tor Johnson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plan-9-from-Outer-Space/dp/B001BSBBGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a>&nbsp;is the up-front guy in this meager-budget Drive-in movie classic. Black-and-white, worth watching but ""so bad that it's good.""]

-- The Terror, starring Boris Karloff [8.0, An early film for jack Nicholson but a good one. It's all about an ancient castle near the seaside, a sort of witch-lady, and a soldier (Nicholson) who wanders in to this hazardous environ. Karloff's performance as the sage old Noble is first class. This is a color film, and nicely shot, but unfortunately this is one of the worst copies that I've ever come across.]

-- Revolt of the Zombies, starring Dean Jagger

-- The Giant Gila Monster, starring Don Sullivan [5.5, Pretty much the same film as the ones about giant ants, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Them-Snap-Case/dp/B000067FP3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Them! (Snap Case)</a>), giant spiders, and so on. Still, I enjoyed watching it and of course it's shot in black-and-white.]

-- The Fatal Hour, starring Boris Karloff

-- Dead Men Walk, starring George Zucco [6.5, George Zucco's performance is terrific as usual but the script is a weak one. Twins, one evil and one good, were well-known in this community. The nefarious one dies... or does he? Black-and-white.]

-- The Mad Monster, starring George Zucco [8.0, Glenn Strange is perfect in his role here as the estate stooge-gardener upon whom Zucco, a mad scientist, conducts nefarious experiments. A wolfman is thus created to knock off those who kicked Zucco out of his cushy University position. A really terrific old black-and-white classic.]

-- Maniac, starring Bill Woods

-- Metropolis, starring Gustav Frolich

-- The Vampire Bat, starring Lionel Atwill [7.5, A real dandy with Bela Lugosi as the mad scientist getting his revenge on the company that he feels wronged him. He develops a gigantic bat which is drawn in by a certain aroma of cologne. Of course this super-bat sucks the blood of Lugosi's enemies.]

-- The Ape, starring Boris Karloff [7.0, A pretty good film where Karloff plays the role of a local doctor who is not much liked in his rural community due to his strange habits and dubious bedside manner. He tries to cure a young gal confined to a wheelchair so she might walk again and, coincidental to his research, a rogue ape escapes from a visiting circus and the creature becomes his lab rat, so to speak. The script is a little weak but not hateful.]

-- The Killer Shrews, starring James Best [7.0, As goofy as the title sounds, this is a better-than-average classic horror flick. The island atmosphere notably enhances the movie -- it's on this island that people get trapped inside a research compound where giant killer shrews (dogs in costume) incessantly attack them! Black-and-white.]

-- Monster Maker, starring J. Carroll Naish [6.5, A mad doctor injects people with the dreaded acromegaly virus, knowing that he's the only guy around with a cure... so folks have to come to him and the price isn't always cash. Not the worst plot I've ever encountered.]

-- King Of The Zombies, starring Dick Purcell

-- The Brain that Wouldn't Die, Starring Jason Evers [7.5, Here we have a pretty good one where an attractive young lady is decapitated in a car crash. Her companion is a surgeon who just happens to specialize (well, he's *about* to anyway) in attaching heads back on to bodies. But while this gals head sits in a tray of solution, additionally supported by all manner of cool wires and tubes, she gets really mean and develops power over others, including the doctor's assistant! The situation gets pretty wild.]

Well, I hope you've benefited to some degree from my limited assessments of these classic films.",1283990400,16,12707,5.615263983272347
2002222,5,B0001HAGTM,"Wow, what a bargain, especially I paid $12.49, but I guarantee this is worth $30 full price, unlike some of the other mill creek collections, and of note are some of the cult classics like Nosferatu, Dimentia 13, Little Shop of Horrors, to name a few.  I am almost considering make a second order of one or two for presents to folks I know, there may never be another set put out like this.  Oh, the movies aren't ""restored"", but who cares, there are ""restored"" versions of many of these movies out there for large coin, its just some of these I had never seen but always heard of.
The movies I've seen so far, oh for instance, Nosferatu, a silent film from 1922, seems okay to me, there may have been the vampires head cut off when he raises from the coffin aboard ship, and maybe there is a restored version out there, so now that I've seen it here on this set, I will investigate a restored version now that I have seen it for the first time, that is what is awesome on this set.
As an update to my earlier review, I have enjoyed alot of these movies, to include the spectacular 119 min version of metropolis, the silent film that is being released in a very complete version since lost footage was discovered in Argentina.  The material on this set seems pretty okay for unrestored, well worth watching for a first time if you have never seen it previously.",1283299200,3,1361,4.350393700787402

WOW --- I had forgotten how BAD some of these movies are --- with contrived/cumbersome plot-lines, low budgets, primitive special effects, poor editing, and questionable acting.  Regardless, these movies are worthwhile from an historic point-of-view.
I had seen several of these movies MANY years ago --- so viewing these again tends to bring back assorted old memories.  As a result, I frequently smile --- while simultaneously grimacing at these primitive examples of film-making.
Hmm... several of these movies (perhaps only the very OLD ones?) have assorted problems.  There are a lot of jump-cuts... as if the original file-stock had missing/damaged segments.  Some films have fuzzy video clarity.  I've also noticed severe cropping on the edges of a few of these.

1. Some of these movies are not horror. They're crime or mystery....but not horror.
2. The selection could have been better. Can you believe they didn't put Bela Lugosi Dracula in here?? I'm still severely disappointed over that.
Nonetheless, there are great classics like Nosferatu, Night of the Living Dead, The Phantom of the Opera, to name a few. It's the main reason I bought it.

2002229,2,B0001HAGTM,"The sound track is nearly completely ruined by an an attempt to improve the sound on every Mill Creek collection that I have bought.

Music: To suppress hiss sounds in the high frequencies the music that accompanies the program has been so lowered in volume that you do NOT feel the musical emotion of the film. This makes every single show unnecessarily boring. It took me a while to realize what was going on. I found that on movies that I have duplicate copies by other DVD makers that the sound is much better and the overall effect is dramatically better even though they have more hiss. Hiss is soothing to some people and it is obviously not worth ruining the sound track to suppress it when you compare.

Dialog: It is hard to tell what the actors are saying. Apparently the sound hiss processing makes the sound suddenly go up and down in volume when an actor talks but the high part of the voice is suppressed to eliminate the hiss. This makes every actors voice sound dull and boring and women do NOT sound as feminine as they normally do (you miss the sexy voice of fem fatals). Suddenly you will hear a little more music when the voice is boosted louder reminding you that you are missing the musical sound track thus you are not feeling the emotion of the program.

Story: Some of these are great old B and B+ movies that are worth watching though they are not the highest budget programs so not the best. Sadly they are ruined by the sound processing. As I have said, I have found a copy of some of the movies on other DVD's and they are dramatically better. Sadly rated a 2.",1273536000,2,1590,4.3830508474576275

The quality of the films range from their original release dates for some of the older films from the 1930's tend to show their age. But overall every film that I have seen so far is watchable and sounds fine. Be aware that Mill Creek Entertainment has been upgrading their packaging of their movie collections from cardboard housing to plastic casing so you might receive the older packaging but they are still the same product and UPC are exact. I posted a picture of what the older packaging looks like (which I own unfortunately) but the new packaging with The Phantom of The Opera on the cover is the new version.

2002245,4,B0001HAGTM,"I bought this set for $14.99 at Best Buy. At 29 cents per movie, I figure I can afford to be disappointed by some of them. I'm very much into both horror movies and old B movies, so the fact that not all of these films are technically ""horror"" really didn't bother me.
These are all public domain movies- that means anyone can reproduce and sell them without worrying about copyright or paying any sort of royalties. That's how they are able to market this package so cheaply. And the title is misleading- by no means are most of these movies ""classics"". In fact, with a few exceptions (""Night of the Living Dead"",""Nosferatu"" and a couple of others) they're largely fairly obscure. But that doesn't mean they're not entertaining.

As noted, the prints and audio vary wildly, from fairly decent all the way to barely watchable (some look suspiciously like VHS transfers). But if you're a stickler for picture quality, chances are you're not into watching stuff like this anyway.

So far I've really enjoyed this set; it goes great with popcorn, pizza, and beer on a Saturday night. It'd certainly rather take my chances on these films than pay $14.99 for a DVD of a single movie only to find out that it sucks, which is the case with about 75% of the stuff coming out these days.",1251676800,6,1278,4.576419213973799

2002248,4,B0001HAGTM,"If you're at all familiar with Treeline Studios' ""50 movies"" anthology collections, then you've probably come to associate them with cheap cardboard boxes filled with B movies for a reasonable price.  The Horror Classics movie pack seems to be cut from a very different mold, though.

For starters, the clam-shell case that it comes in is very attractive.  This may seem like a silly thing to care about, but it actually looks nice on my movie shelf, whereas my cardboard&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SciFi-Classics-50-Movie-Pack-Collection/dp/B0001HAGU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SciFi Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection</a>&nbsp;looks cheap and annoys me every time I see it.  The discs contained within still come in those cheap cardboard sleeves, but they are at least locked securely into a plastic compartment within the clam-shell.  They're also nicer looking than the old generic red envelopes. Please note that older versions of this set still come in a cardboard box, so be careful when buying from third party vendors.  You want the new edition with the Phantom of the Opera on the cover.

More important than appearance, though, is the content in this collection.  Whereas most or all of these collections are filled to the brim with cheap B movies that you'd never consider buying on their own, this anthology contains many of the greatest classic horror films ever made (Phantom of the Opera, Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde, White Zombie, Carnival of Souls, Nosferatu, Hunchback of Notre Dame, etc), as well as a number of other entertaining and well-respected horror films, many of which star legends such as Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, and Vincent Price.  Of course, there are a few of the better B horror films as well, including my personal favorite, Maniac. Most of these films aren't scary by modern standards, but they still manage to set a tone of suspense and excitement, all richly encapsulated in a sense of the grotesque.  There's something in these films that you can't find in modern day horror; call it style, artistic merit, pacing, restraint, or anything else that suits you.  Whatever that missing ingredient is, it's here.

Regarding quality, you obviously can't expect anything worthy of an HD TV for this price.  Most of these films are adequate captures from the same public domain footage that you might see put out by Alpha Video or shown by a local television network after midnight.  Fair quality, for the most part.  There seems to be more blurriness on the later films (Night of the Living Dead, Little Shop of Horrors, etc), while the older silent films contain cropped aspect ratios (you can still read most title cards) and bad scores (turn off your volume!).

However, there is at least one film in this collection where the quality is inexcusably bad.  Metropolis, as an extreme example, looks like someone held a camcorder to a television screen, resulting in a crooked picture, terrible cropping (you can't read anything) and blurriness so bad that you'll swear you're losing consciousness.  This is inexcusable considering how many excellent public domain copies there are of this film.  And seriously, what is Metropolis doing in a horror anthology anyway?

Honestly, I haven't seen any other movie in this collection that I would consider unwatchable (though I've only seen about a third of them), but quality does waver.

Here's the full list of what I have watched so far and how the quality fared:

*Atom Age Vampire (****): Very watchable, with only the faintest contrast and sound quality problems.

*Black Dragons (****): Aside from some minor graininess, the picture is crisp and the sound is clear.

*Carnival of Souls (****):  Looks great.  Sound is a little muffled.  Nearly as good as a pricier copy.

*Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde (***): Slightly blurry at times.  The score is terrible.  Pretty watchable with the volume turned off.

*House on Haunted Hill (*****): First rate.  Best quality movie in this collection.

*Hunchback of Notre Dame (****): Lots of scratches and film damage, but overall good looking for an old silent film.  Bad score.  Keep the volume off.

*Invisible Ghost (****): Overall excellent with a slight compromise in sound quality.

*Last Man on Earth (**): Very grainy picture.  Inexcusable when much better copies are available in public domain.

*Little Shop of Horrors (***): Blurry.  Sound is a bit muffled.  Not bad, but it could be a lot better.

*Maniac (****): Mostly excellent.  A few scratches/artifacts here and there.

*Metropolis (0 stars): See my comments above.

*Night of the Living Dead (**): A little too blurry and muffled.  Honestly, it's not terrible, but there are MUCH better copies available in public domain.

*Nosferatu (***): The cropping/wrong aspect ratio seems to hurt this film more than most, but the quality is decent, and the score is the least terrible of all the silent films in this collection.  Very watchable.

*Phantom of the Opera (****): A few too many scratches/artifacts, and there's some blurriness here and there, but it looks pretty good overall.  Awful score.  Turn the volume off.

*Revolt of the Zombies (***): Very watchable.  The sound quality is poor to begin with on this film, so turn up your speakers.  A few minor transfer errors towards the start (the worst one causes the contrast to go crazy for about a second), but solid otherwise.

*The Terror (***): I've only watched the beginning so far, but it looks solid.  There is a thin white line running down the right edge of the screen at times, but the colors and sound seem to be fine otherwise.

*White Zombie (****): Considering how much I had to pay to get a reasonable quality copy of this (my favorite horror film), I'm surprised how good this one is.  The contrast is too bright and there are small jumps in the film from time to time, but the sound was so bad on this film to begin with that it's difficult to find a copy where you can make out all of the dialogue.  I can make out all of the dialogue on this one.

All in all, if you're looking to obtain the best of the best classic horror films at an affordable price and are willing to sacrifice some quality, you can't go wrong with this collection.  If nothing more, it would serve as an excellent introduction to the genre, containing virtually every great classic horror film ever made (with the exception of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-monster-films/dp/B0001CNRNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal monster films</a>&nbsp;which are still under copyright).",1248739200,10,6625,5.129785247432307
2002249,5,B0001HAGTM,"I have a hard time believing that some of the reviewers here that gave this set 1 or 2 stars saying that it has no good titles can claim they have any appreciation for horror movies.  I love Frankenstein and other such big name classics, but that's not the limit of good, old horror flicks.  Check the titles, folks.  There is at least one review here that lists and summarizes each and every movie.  If they don't sound appealing don't get the set.  As for my 2 cents, several of these movies I already owned because they are simply worth seeing multiple times.  House on Haunted Hill is one of my favorite black and white horror flicks. I figured if a movie that good was in this set there were likely to be other good ones as well.  I wasn't disappointed.

So, yes, this set most definitely does contain a number of classics, probably more so than any other huge mega-pack I've seen.  I think it's more fair to say that just because a movie is a classic doesn't mean you're going to like it.  But how are you going to know that if you don't see it?  Nosferatu, Metropolis, Night of the Living Dead, and others are classics for good reason and are worth seeing for their cinematic significance if for no other reason.

The downside to this uber-cheap set of so many movies is that the presentation is also cheap.  The audio and video is unrestored and unremarkable.  I've come across dialogue that was hard to hear and sections that skip. That's annoying and if too frequent would have killed any and all enjoyment of the viewing experience, but considering the set price I'll deal with that happeneing from time to time.  I've compared the transfer quality of these to that of the movies I already owned (and paid much more for than I did to own them in this set).  By and large there isn't enough improvement in quality to justify the higher price I paid for the individual versions.

Still, that doesn't mean that the pricier versions of the likes of Metropolis aren't worth some extra cost to some people.  My recommendtation is to get this super-cheap set and treat it as a sort of sampler.  If you find a movie you like enough to buy a more expensive version with better transfer and some bonus features, then at least you already know it's worth it instead of gambling.

Are you getting the most difinitive versions of these movies? That's hard to say.  Some people claim to have seen a scene involving a Great Dane in the movie The Vampire Bat that is not present in this copy.  On the other hand some people have commented that they think the claims of nudity in Maniac have been fabricated because they haven't been able to track down a version with those scenes, yet here they are.

You should know that not every movie in this pack necessarily falls into the genre of horror.  Karloff's Detective Wong movies, for example, are murder mysteries not horror.  I can't complain though, because these are some of my favorite movies on the set, and I aim to eventually find all of the Wong movies to own.

I won't go through every movie since that has been done already but I will say that I found some that I liked a lot but had not previously heard of like The Screaming Skull.

I found some that I enjoyed seeing but probably would not own if not for getting this set like Attack of the Giant Leeches and One Body Too Many.

I found some that are cult classics like The Brain That Wouldn't Die and White Zombie that I kept hearing about but never saw.  This gave me the opportunity to form my own opinions on them without spending much money which I appreciated since I think both are highly overrated.

But of course I did find some stinkers that were a complete waste of time like Beast of Yucca Flats, Bluebeard, and The Corpse Vanishes.

If you like old horror movies at all I think it highly unlikely that you won't find at least a few in this set you'll enjoy.  Check out some of the famous titles you haven't seen so you can now discuss them with your horror movie buff friends.  Have your own Mystery Science Theatre party.  The possibilities are endless.  All I can really say is that I have thoroughly appreciated owning this set.",1241049600,5,4151,4.438573315719947

2002265,4,B0001HAGTM,"I purchased this b/c of a lack of good horror films on tv.  In the old days ca 1970s, you used to have really cool shows like Chiller Theater and Creature Features and One Step Beyond.  Unfortunately, most tv is terrible with either too much gore and porn or just plain bad. Here you can get 50 of some of the real rare classics.  Sure a few of of films are poor quality, but these are real gems. One of my personal fav's in this collection is Carnival of Souls! Including many others featuring Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and much more.  Makes the perfect gift for the holidays. Enjoy~!",1227312000,,586,4.348623853211009

Thes rest of the films are very fun to watch and the price you are paying for them is amazing. nosferatu or metropolis alone can cost more on their own.

The only problem I had was with nosferatu which for some reason skips before the end of the film and gets stuck there. which is why I gave it 4 stars.

otherwise great buy for horror enthusiasts.",1227052800,2,520,4.295918367346939
2002267,5,B0001HAGTM,"I bought this box set for my mother-in-law because she loves old horror movies.  She was so happy when she opened it and read all the names of the movies on the back of the box.  She said a lot of the movies she hasn't seen since her childhood and had been looking for them.  I am going to purchase some of the other box sets for her for the upcoming holiday because she really enjoyed it.  I would recommend this to anyone, I mean for the price look how many movies you get!!!",1226793600,,477,4.042553191489362
2002268,2,B0001HAGTM,"Though most of the movies I hadn't heard of, there were a good number that I was very excited to see(""Metropolis,"" ""Nosferatu,"" ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" ""The Phantom of the Opera""). Some of these I hadn't yet seen, and others I had only watched on crappy YouTube uploads. So you can imagine my joy when I saw this collection at my friend's apartment, and immediately borrowed two or three of the discs.

While there are some brilliant films here (anything with Lon Chaney Sr. is bound to be good), the quality is horribly disappointing. I realize that, for the price, I couldn't expect top-quality versions, but these are among the worst I've seen. They go beyond your typical old-movie grainy--in some of them, I'm surprised the film didn't fall apart midway through the showing!

I would recommend this set if you already like old movies, but need an introduction to a few of the great classic ""horror"" films (""Metropolis"" I hardly consider horror, and ""Phantom"" and ""Hunchback"" could only be considered so because of the painful horror of humanity Chaney portrays) and you either have very little money (ah, college and a failing economy), or simply don't want to spend much on old films. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere. The four movies I mentioned are certainly worth looking into, if you can find better copies of them. The beauty of the architecture and the chilling visage of the robot in Metropolis, the terror of Orlok's hunting in Nosferatu, and Chaney's brilliant acting and makeup that give us a glimpse into the darkest regions of ourselves in Phantom and Hunchback--all these things deserve to be seen in as much clarity as possible, not scratched and faded to the point where they lose some of their power.",1225238400,3,1730,4.841216216216216
2002269,3,B0001HAGTM,"This collection is packed with early horror icons-my favorite Vincent Price along with Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Sr, Fay Wray (King Kong's woman), and even a young Jack Nicholson. Pretty impressive so far, right? Then the list of movies is a who's who of early horror classics minus the Universal Studios monsters. From early classics of Phantom of The Opera, Nosferatu, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and I was very excited to see Metropolis in this set but its more sci fi then horror. Plus my favorite horror movie of all time House on Haunted Hill, Night of The Living Dead, among many others. Pretty impressive for a three stars? Well Ive had this set for three years but never really watched any of the films. I recently dug it out to watch Metropolis but I will get around to watching some others that look good.

The package is cheap but very resourceful. The dvds come in a cardboard sleeve with movie title and synopsis of the film. The films are all public property so that means the film quality is not so great. Most of this films can be bought for under five bucks and there are many copies floating around. I still recommend this set though. The price is right and you get a helluva lotta great horror films.",1224374400,3,1234,4.533632286995516

2002281,4,B0001HAGTM,"I bought this collection recently and I am very happy with the selection.  However, there are some oddities that subtract from the overall experience.  My DVD player skips and freezes through the warnings and other introductions before it gets to the Menu.  It makes loud noises and sounds as though it is breaking, which doesn't happen when I watch DVDs that weren't part of this pack.  Another strange thing is that the DVDs are double sided but the movies on Side A are actually on side B and vice versa.  I'm not sure if I just got some bum DVDs or if these flukes occur in all batches.  Neither of the flaws are too terrible, and the movies are still quite watchable.  I would just caution that there are some problems.",1223596800,3,724,4.480916030534351

2002283,1,B0001HAGTM,There are a couple of good old classic flicks in this package but most are too painful to watch.  Obviously most of these were made by first time wannabe film producers / directors who spent their entire week's allowance making these pics. I am a huge fan of corny 50's-60's horror / suspense films so on second thought maybe you could classify this package as true horror.  Classic... I don't think so.  Sorry...,1221955200,5,413,4.63013698630137
2002284,4,B0001HAGTM,I have to say that I am a little disappointed with some of the reviews on here.  Describing these movies as barely watchable.  I just recieved this set in the mail today and have watched The house on haunted hill and the invisible body.  The house on haunted hill was incredible quality wise.  The sound and video were amazing.  The movie itself is a very good movie as well.  The invisible body is a corny movie but that is ok it is still good.  There are some marks on the sides of the movie every once in a while but nothing that makes it unwatchable.  I guess that when I watch old movies like these the one thing i keep in mind is that some of the are over 50 years old.  Try preserving a movie for that long given the technology they had then and have it stand up against the movies of today.  I will edit my review as I continue watching the movies and I may need to adjust things but right now i am very happy with the product.  This was well worth the price.  I would have paid this much for house on haunted hill alone.  If the rest of the movies are of the same video and audio quality then this will be the best dea[ l I have found.,1221523200,5,1144,4.008849557522124
2002285,5,B0001HAGTM,"This is by far the best money I've spent in a LONG time. You have to remember one thing about these movies though - Back in the 20s, horror had a different taste. Good old Frankenstein didn't show up on the screen until 1931! Everyone knows Frankenstein, Dracula, Mummy, etc... I'm personally glad they they didn't include films of those types in this collection. How many people know of The Killer Shrews? This is a fine collection for for what I paid.

2002288,4,B0001HAGTM,"I bought this set for my husband's birthday and we have both been enjoying these classic horror movies, watching one or two a day (most run between 65-90 minutes, ""Metropolis"" is the longest at 119) for the past month. I am kind of sad it does not include ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", but there are many other great classics (""Nosferatu"", ""Bluebeard"") and not-so-greats (""White Zombie"" with Bela Lugosi, ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die""). Some of the special effects are laughable (the Killer ""Shrews"" and Attack of the Giant ""Leeches"") but I like the fact the movies were more about the suspense without being overly gory. ""Atom Age Vampire"", ""Dementia 13"", ""The Last Man on Earth"", the silent ""Phantom of the Opera"" and the original ""Little Shop of Horrors"" are favorites of mine. I agree the quality of the films is not the best, but this is a great deal to get 50 movies on 12 DVDs for less than the price of one new release.",1213747200,2,924,4.572289156626506

All of these films are excellent for some cinema escapism or maybe some Mystery Science Theatre 3000 snarky, silly comments and a good laugh. It's all fun! And it has all the great horror stars of the past - Bela Lagosi, Boris Karloff, Barbara Steele, Vincent Price, Lon Chaney Sr. and Jr. and, yes, Mannix himself, Mike Connors (Touch Connors, as he was known then).

I'm slowly working my way through them, am finishing Last Man on Earth and started with White Zombie.

All in all a great set. Below I'm going to list the title of the movie as it appeared in the set a rating and a brief synopsis. All movies rated out of 5 stars.
1=Awful,2=Poor,3=Fair,4=Good and 5=Great

1. Carnival of Souls 5/5 A woman and her two friends are drag racing when there car goes off a bridge into the river but somehow she manages to survive. Creepy and fun a must see.
2. Atomic Age Vampire 3/5 A scientist makes a serum using female glands that can make a woman beautiful again after she's scarred in an car accident,but to make it permanent He must kill to get more glands for the serum. Good concept but could be dull at times.
3. Creature from the Haunted Sea 1/5 A revolution breaks out on a carribean island and a mobster offers some nationalists (and the government's money) protection on his boat all the while planning to kill the nationalists and take the money blaming it on a sea monster.  He soon finds out that the sea monster is real. I usually like Roger Corment's movies but I just couldn't get into this one. It seemed to drag forever. I will say one good thing though the moster was good for a laugh. (It looks like something off of Sesame Street!)
4. Nightmare Castle 4/5 A count finds out that his wife has been unfaithful and tortures her and her lover to death. About a year later the count remarries and his new wife immediately starts having terrible dreams. Barbara Steel was great in the dual role of the first and second wives and the atmosphere was creepy. Good
5. Black Dragons 3/5 More of a Crime-Drama\Mystery than Horror. American leaders are being murdered and all have a Japanese dagger in there hand when they're found. The cardboard sleeve gives it all away. Ok but not really horror.
6. The Invisible Ghost 4/5 A good man is driven to kill by what He thinks is his wife's ghost. One of Lugosi's better B movies. Good
7. One Body Too Many 3/5 An insurence agent comes to a house to sell a life insurence policy and discovers that the owner is already dead and that the relatives have to stay at the house until the body is picked up. Lugosi plays a small part as a butler in this one. Ok
8. White Zombie 4/5 A man is furious after the woman He loves rejects his marriage proposal and enlists the help of a voodoo priest (Bela Lugosi) to make her a zombie. Good
9. Attack of the Giant Leeches 2/5 A game warden is skeptical when the locals start telling stories about a bloodsucking creature but later becomes convinced when more and more bloodless bodies start turning up. This movie was pretty slow and dull but at least the giant leeches sort of looked like leeches eventhough you could tell they were made of rubber. Good for a laugh.
10. The Screaming Skull 4/5 Newlyweds move into the husband's house that He shared with his first wife and his new wife starts seeing a skull everywhere. This one was fun but a little predictible.
11. Beast of Yucca Flats 1/5 A man is exposed to massive dose of radiation when a nuclear bomb explodes and is turned into a hulk like monster. Would have been so much better without the stupid narration!
12. The Terror 3/5 Jack Nicholson plays a french military officer in the 19th century who gets lost along the coast and comes upon a mysteries girl who helps him find his way then disappears. Nicholson then finds his way to a castle were the girl may live. A little strange but not too bad.
13. Revolt of the Zombies 1/5 After WW I a count hidden in Cambodia has discovered how to re-animate corpses and turn them into zombies,He then plans to expand his empire using an army of zombies. A expedition is sent to the capital city of Angkar to stop him but one of the members of  the expedition has plans to steal the secrets of zombie making for his own purposes. Good concept but extremely dull movie. I had trouble sitting through this one.
14. The Giant Gila Monster 2/5 A machanic with dreams of becoming a singer must save his little sister and others from a giant gila monster. Would've been better if the guy wasn't singing though half the movie. Is this a musical or a horror movie?
15. The Fatal Hour  3/5 This isn't a horror movie it's a crime/detective movie. Mr. Wong(Boris Karloff) investigates the murder of a police officer with a police capitain and a reporter. Ok mystery
16. Dead Men Walk 4/5 George Zucco plays the clayton twins. Lloyd Clayton murders his evil brother Elwyn who is  into the dark arts and returns from the grave to get revenge. Good
17. The Mad Monster 2/5 A scientist who has been discredited in the academic community as mad discovers a formula that turn his assistant into a werewolf. Boring
18. Maniac 1/5 A mad scientist is attempting the re-animation of dead tissue when he dies and his assistant assumes his identity. As the assistant slowly descends into madness clips from the silent films Witchcraft through the Ages and Siegfred are cut into the story. Good premise but dull.
19. Metropolis (Silent) 4/5 More sci-fi than horror. In a futuristic society the technocrats (upper class)live in luxury above ground  while the lower class are made to live under ground as slaves and run the machnes that make the metropolis run. When the son of one of the leaders of the technocrats falls in love with a slave girl,He is confronted by the intolerable conditions that the slave laborers must live in and tries to help them. A story that really makes you think.

22. The Monster Maker 4/5 A mad scientist injects a famous pianist with a horrible disease without his knowledge that leaves him horribly deformed. In exchange for an antidote the scientist wants money and the pianist's daughter's hand in marriage. Good I felt so sorry for that poor man.

34. Nosferatu (Silent) A German version of Dracula. A real estate agent goes to Transilvania to close a sale with Herr Orlok and discovers that he's a vampire. One of the best vampire's ever. Maz Schreck does a great job playing Nosferatu.
35. Swamp Women 2/5 Another crime-drama. Three women along with an under cover cop pretending to be a convict escape from prison and go into the swamp looking for thousands of dollars worth of jewels that they've hidden there. Pretty lame,but there was one scene of a woman getting eaten by an aligator.
36. The World Gone Mad 3/5 A district attorney and a reporter try to find out who killed there friend who was the former D.A. who  just happened to have uncovered massive stock fraud a short time before. A crime drama Ok

We then find out that the Gappa (imagine Godzilla crossed with a chicken) are not gods but the names of the reptiles the inhabit the island and they will stop at nothing to get there baby back. Good in a so bad it's good kind of way.
41. The Gorilla 2/5 A serial killer called the gorilla threatens an attotney and He calls on The Ritz Brthers to act as bodyguards. A comedy/mystery the only really funny person was the housekeeper otherwise pretty boring.
42. A Shriek in the Night 2/5 When a millionaire falls to his death from his penthouse balcony,it's discovered that it may be murder. The buildings residents come under suspcion especially since more people end up dead. An early Ginger Rogers movie before she teamed up with Fred Astaire. Boring
43. Bloodlust! 4/5 A group of teenagers decide to go exploring on what they think is a deserted island,but discover a crazy millionaire who likes to hunt down people for fun. Good
*Note+ The Cardboard sleeve says that Bloodlust! was made in 1959 and runs 89 mins. but mine only ran 68 mins. I checked with a movie data base and the info should read Bloodlust! 1961 68 mins.
44. The Amazing Mr. X 4/5 A young widow thinks that she hears the voice of her dead husband calling out to her from the ocean. While walking along the beach she meets Alexis a man who know much more than he should about her. Good suspense

46. The Bat 3.5/5 A mystery writer is renting a house from a bank president who has hidden a million dollars worth of stolen money in the house and the killer called ""The Bat"" will stop at nothing to find tt. Pretty good
47. The House on Haunted Hill 4.5/5 Vincent Price rents out the house on haunted hill and offers 5 people $10,000 each if they will spend the night there. Great haunted house movie but the ending left a little to be desired.
48. The Last Man on Earth 5/5 Vincent Price plays Robert Morgan a scientist who is the last surviving man since a plague has turned everyone else into vampires.
49. Dementia 13 4/5 Lady Haloran tortures herself over the drowning death of her little girl sever years earlier. Francis Ford Coppola's directoral debute. Good
50. Phantom from 10,000 Leagues 2/5 When horribly burned radioactive bodies begin turning up on a beach the government sends a scientist and an agent to investigate. Pretty dull.

Ranging from silent classics to 1968's groundbreaking Night of the Living Dead, this collection is sure to please fans of kitschy B-grade horror. There are even a few for those who prefer the offbeat, such as Carnival of Souls (1961) and the original Little Shop of Horrors (1960) featuring Jack Nicholson. Genre giants Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi make several appearances, while Vincent Price features in the classic House on Haunted Hill (1959).

There are a lot of old mysteries in it like the Boris Karloff Mr. Wong movies. They're entertaining yes, but not horror classics. There are a few that wouldn't even rate one star, such as Maniac and Beast of Yucca Flats. You wonder why they would even waste film to make these horrible movies. A lot of crap is loaded into this collection that has bad sound and film condition, obviously most of them are public domain and have never been restored. Believe it or not, the best of the lot are The Screaming Skull, The Killer Shrews, and The Giant Gila Monster, and they're just corny movies from the 50's. I tossed every disk out after just one watching. Why? Because I know that I'll never waste my time watching them again. Don't waste your money.

2002351,3,B0001HAGTM,"Long before slasher movies became popular, studios had to rely on suspenseful writing, good acting, and MOOD to produce enjoyable horror movies.  Many of the films in this collection fall into that category.

Other reviewers have listed the titles, so I won't go into those.  Most of these are in black and white and are from the 30s, 40s, and 50s. Those featuring Bela Lugosi in his declining years are rather sad, but others are effective at scaring the daylights out of you.

I'm a big Vincent Price fan.  He's a treat no matter what role he plays.  Boris Karloff, a very underrated actor, makes a couple appearances in this collection too.

Some are so bad they're outright laughable.  Remember that there was no computer animation then, so special effects were much tougher.  By today's standards, some the monsters are more funny than scary.

You won't find biggies like Dracula, The Wolfman, or The Mummy in this collection, but it's a wide variety of horror films with something for everybody.  Expect some undiscovered gems amid the run-of-the-mill and you won't be disappointed.",1188345600,4,1088,4.923076923076923
2002352,3,B0001HAGTM,"This is an excellent selection of campy old movies, well worth five stars; however, it is not an excellent selection of campy old horror movies. I suppose this depends upon your idea of what ""horror"" is, but a solid half of these movies do not qualify as horror in my vocabulary. Just because Boris Karloff plays a Chinese detective in a movie does not make it a horror show. In fact, it makes it a detective show with nothing horrible about it. There's several murder mysteries in this package, and most have big names from the legitimate horror genre, but don't expect a good fright with each flick.

The sound quality in many of these selections is as bad as others have mentioned, but surprisingly, I've found that I get used to it within a few minutes and they seem quite audible.

If you're looking for a great mix of (often wacky) old movies, only some of which might be called horror, this is a great choice. Otherwise, you might be better off with the Chilling Classics selection also available from Amazon.",1188259200,4,1016,4.576923076923077

I was thinking more along the lines of more recent horror movies (1970-1980's), so when we saw the very old, very campy B movies it was not a hit at our house, so it was bad from that stand point. It certainly is not my idea of ""classic"" horror movies. HOWEVER, there are plenty of people out there that LOVE really, really bad B movies and I've got to say this is a 5 star pick for those types of movies. (They should change the name of this to ""50 really, really bad Horror Classic B movies you'll laugh at for days"".) I'm kind of in that catagory and was amazed at how much fun they were from that angle - there were some really pathetic movies in there!!

Amazon was great about replacing the set for free, but even the replacement set had a defective DVD (maybe more than one, but I didn't audition all of them.)

I'd seen only bits and pieces of these movies over the years in late night movie marathons and cable, it was one of the first opportunities I had to see the entire movie from beginning to end.  These movies are funny in so many ways, as in the silent movie era a lot of these actors were made up to look cartoonish rather than scary.  I'd read that for movie make up Lon Chaney Sr. (and Jr.) didn't even use make up or prothetics but taped their faces and used hooks to change their appearence.  There never was a ""How To"" instruction book on things, they had to learn by doing.

The only bit of criticism for this is that it's quite long.  Don't think that you can watch an entire disc in one sitting.  A little of these movies go a long way.",1181865600,5,984,4.088541666666667

My Book of Common Dread reinvented the vampire, and my The Bell Witch/An American Haunting became the movie An American Haunting with Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek.  Not only does my work demand knowledge of what's out there in print and on film, but I was also born just early enough to have caught a number of the films in this collection when they first came out.  In most genres, a collection of works of such low acting and production value quality would be a waste of money.  But we all know most so-called horror movies are second-rate Hollywood citizens right from the get-go.  How many have won Academy Awards?  Some of these are fun because they're so bad.  Others are interesting because they have famous directors getting their start somewhere, mystery and horror writers of skill penning the dialogue, or actors who will later become famous.

They feature such luminaries as the immortal Max Schreck, John Barrymore (before the ""Great Profile"" got eroded by alcohol) and ""The Man Of 1,000 Faces,"" Lon Chaney (the father).

As for what's left-- it's a mixed bag. Many of Lugosi's lesser efforts, a couple by Karloff, Price and Chaney Jr. can be found.

2002376,5,B0001HAGTM,"This is Truly one of the craziest DVD sets that I have ever owned.

It has such a wide variety of Horror, Sci-Fi and Comedy (either planned by the filmmaker or unintentionally funny!)

Cheesy classics, to be sure.

Many of these films were fodder for 'Mystery Science Theater 3000'.

There are too many titles to mention, but a few highlights:

'King Of The Zombies' (a HOOT!), 'House On Haunted Hill', 'Night Of The Living Dead', 'Carnival Of Souls', 'The Killer Shrews', 'The Screaming Skull', 'The Little Shop Of Horrors', with a very young Jack Nicholson in a cameo, 'Metropolis', 'The Last Man On Earth', 'Blue Beard', 'The Indestructible Man, etc.

There is so much cheese here, it should be from Wisconsin! Ha Ha!

It is a very interesting way to package it, with 12 2-sided DVD's, with 4 movies on each disc.

It's such a deal for so many great and not so great low budget movies.

I love it!

I agree the quality of the picture and sound is VERY variable from film to film, and some are downright awful, but I still highly recommend this to have a huge collection of fun old 'Horror' movies.

There are actually quite a few 'big stars' in these old flicks.

Check it out!

2002391,4,B0001HAGTM,"This is a wonderful package, possibly the best of the 50 Movie Packs. The reason for this is that although bad comedy and musicals are often just bad, bad horror is often good comedy. I think the success of Mystery Science 3000 proves this point. There are some awful films in here, usually because they are too slow. However, most of it, if not good horror or mystery, is at least good campy fun. The transfers are average quality, so if you think you have struck gold and that you are getting the actual restored versions of Noseferatu and Metropolis, guess again. Nobody else actually listed every movie with a brief description, so I do this next. The asterisk indicates an exceptionally good film by my estimation. Sometimes they are truly classic such as ""Metropolis"", and sometimes they are just my personal favorites such as ""The World Gone Mad"". I list the films in chronological order.

Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde starring John Barrymore (1920) - rather campy presentation of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic.

* Nosferatu starring Max Schreck (1922) - F. W. Murnau's stolen version of Dracula may be the creepiest ever.

* The Hunchback of Notre Dame Lon Chaney, Sr. (1923) - Another classic tale, this one more of a melodrama.

* The Phantom of the Opera starring Lon Chaney, Sr. (1925) - The definitive rendition of the Phantom.

* Metropolis starring Gustav Frolich (1927) - Fritz Lang's silent masterpiece about a society divided into two classes - those who labor and those who profit from that labor.

* White Zombie starring Bela Lugosi (1932) - A woman is killed and then resurrected as a zombie by a Haitian witch doctor.

The Monster Walks starring Rex Lease (1932) - This early talkie is one of the worst horror films ever made, and that's part of the fun.

* The World Gone Mad starring Pat O'Brien  (1933) - A thriller, not a horror film, about a corporate plot uncovered by a reporter.

A Shriek in the Night starring Ginger Rogers (1933) - Slow low budget mystery before Fred came along to take Ginger away from all of this.

The Vampire Bat (1933) - When bloodless bodies start turning up, is it the work of a murderer or a vampire? This not so bad production has a pretty good cast including Fay Wray and Melvin Douglas.

Maniac starring Bill Woods (1934) - A mad doctor goes around restoring life to the lifeless, even if he has to kill people to do it. A weird film by a man who was originally a real estate agent.

Revolt of the Zombies starring Dean Jagger (1936) - A French expedition into Indochina to destroy a formula for creating zombie soldiers played out against the backdrop of a love triangle.

The Gorilla starring The Ritz Brothers (1939) - A comedy/thriller starring those C- Marx Bros. imitations, the Ritz's.

The Fatal Hour starring Boris Karloff (1940) - Karloff as detective James Lee Wong in a knock-off of Charlie Chan.

Doomed to Die starring Boris Karloff (1940) - A rather ridiculous mystery in which Karloff is back as James Lee Wong.

The Ape starring Boris Karloff (1940) - Karloff is a doctor seeking a cure for polio and roaming the city at night dressed as an ape. There's a connection between the two activities - honest!

Invisible Ghost starring Bela Lugosi (1941) - Lugosi is driven to kill by the sight of what he thinks is his dead wife.

* King of the Zombies starring Dick Purcell (1941) - Extremely politically incorrect film with hilarious one-liners by Mantan Moreland that turn what could have been a dismally slow horror film into a delightful comedy.

Black Dragons starring Bela Lugosi (1942) - Bela was reduced to working in very bad films such as this spy movie after his star began to fall.

The Corpse Vanishes starring Bela Lugosi (1942) - ridiculous tale of a man who kills brides and uses their bodily fluids to keep his wife young.

The Mad Monster starring George Zucco (1942) - A fun if somewhat slow film about a scientist who is shunned by his peers just because he likes to go around inventing formulas that turn humans into monsters.

Dead Men Walk starring George Zucco (1943) - Good twin kills an evil twin. The evil twin then emerges from the grave a vampire in search of revenge. Zucco does a good job playing the role of the twins.

Blue Beard starring John Carradine (1944) - slow moving tale of a deranged man who likes to paint pictures of girls before he strangles them.

One Body Too Many starring Bela Lugosi - (1944) - Actually more of a comedy in which Lugosi is the butler in a house of greedy relatives visiting to hear the will of the departed and wealthy Uncle Cyrus.

The Monster Maker starring Carrol Naish (1944) - An entertaining horror film in which a mad doctor infects people with a disfiguring disease just because he is the only one who has a cure.

* The Amazing Mr. X starring Turhan Bay (1948) - A widow stuck in the past, a fake greedy spiritualist, and a detective on the trail of the unexplained make for a very well done B+ film noir.

Swamp Women starring Mike Connors (1955) - Bad girls escaped from prison looking for their stolen treasure in the bayou. Definitely not up to being MST3K material.

Phantom from 10,000 Leagues starring Kent Taylor (1955) - Radioactivity is to blame for creating a sea monster.

The Indestructible Man starring Lon Chaney, Jr. (1956) - A career criminal railroaded into a murder rap is executed but then brought back to life by a mad scientist looking for a cancer cure. Frankenstein meets film noir.

The Screaming Skull starring John Hudson (1958) - Predictable story of a widower who remarries, but their home seems to be haunted by the previous wife.

The Bat starring Vincent Price (1959) - A crazed killer is on the prowl in a house full of people.

* The House on Haunted Hill starring Vincent Price (1959) - Showman William Castle's tale about people who are offered a large cash prize by a wealthy man if they survive the night in a haunted house.

Attack of the Giant Leeches starring Ken Clark (1959) - So bad it's good. A giant leech is stealing backwoods bayou residents and feeding on them. Hilarity ensues.

The Giant Gilla Monster starring Don Sullivan (1959) - An out-of-what pituitary gland causes a gilla monster to grow to tremendous size and threaten the inhabitants of rural Texas. An OK monster film.

The Killer Shrews starring Thorne Sherman (1959) - A mad scientist has an unusual pursuit - creating giant rodents that  look a lot like dogs dressed in fragments of carpet. I found it hilarious in dialogue and effects.

Tormented starring Richard Carlson (1960) - A man dumps his mistress via murder to marry a society girl. The problem is the girl haunts him piece by body piece.

Last Woman on Earth starring Robert Towne (1960) - A trio of scuba divers emerge from the water to find everyone else has died an atomic age death. They have plenty of everything, but only one woman.

Atom Age Vampire starring Alberto Lupo (1960) - A scientist must have a fresh supply of dead young women to keep his own beloved beautiful after she is involved in a bad auto accident. It's been done before, and it's been done better.

Bloodlust starring Robert Reed (1961) - A very badly done film about a wealthy man stalking human prey on his private island.

Creature from the Haunted Sea starring Robert Towne (1961) - A criminal is killing his partners and blaming the death on a mythical sea monster, but the monster is actually real.

Beast of Yucca Flats starring Tor Johnson (1961) - After Ed Wood made him a star, Tor Johnson got the lead in a tale about a Russian scientist transformed into a homicidal beast by an atomic bomb blast.

* The Little Shop of Horrors starring Jack Nicholson (1962) - A strange plant grows to mammoth proportions feeding on human blood.

* Carnival of Souls starring Candace Hilligoss (1962) - Ponders the question - When the emotionally dead actually die, do they even notice?

* The Brain That Wouldn't Die starring Jason Evers (1962) - When a doctor's fiance is decapitated in a car accident he keeps the head alive until he can find her another body. The head is not happy about this.

* Dementia 13 starring William Campbell (1963) - Early Francis Ford Coppola film is a low budget psychological thriller.

The Terror starring Boris Karloff (1963) - Campy horror/mystery about a French soldier who runs across a castle in which mysterious events occur.

* The Last Man on Earth starring Vincent Price (1964) - Price is a doctor and also the sole survivor of a plague in which the victims rise at night as zombies. Is he alone on earth or isn't he?

Nightmare Castle starring Barbara Steele (1966) - A pair of murder victims rise from the grave to seek revenge on the woman's husband, who is their murderer.

Monster from a Prehistoric Planet starring Tamio Kawaji (1967) - An obvious take-off on Godzilla.

* Night of the Living Dead starring Judith O'Dea (1968) - Radiation causes the recently dead to come to life, causing them to eat the flesh of the living, who then die and come back to life, and so on.",1172880000,18,9017,4.6107634543178975

2002399,4,B0001HAGTM,"Some reviewers are whining about this collection. I can't imagine why. 50 movies for 15 bucks, sure the quality isn't high-def and some of the sound is warbly. What'd you expect?

There are plenty of solid movies in this set. ""Tormented"" is a little gem, directed by Bert I Gordon and starring Richard Carlson. A nasty guy sends his girlfriend to her death so he can get married...and then has to face the consequences. ""Night of the Living Dead"" remains one of the creepiest films of all time, ever. Watch it alone after midnight, I dare ya! (Better yet, watch it with a pal...) The three Vincent Price movies are all great, especially the campy-scary ""House on Haunted Hill,"" which will have you chuckling and then diving under the blankets. ""The Last Man on Earth,"" is also effective, as Vince takes on a planet full of killer zombies. ""Carnival of Souls"" is unexpectedly disturbing, it's been lodged in my head now for the past couple of weeks. A woman appears to die in a car crash--then unexpectedly reappears. She seems a little off, though. ""The Indestructible Man"" was enjoyable too, with Lon Chaney as a tough-talking street hood who's brought back to life, Frankenstein style, and then decides to go after dem dirty rats what sold him out. Sci-fi-film-noir, I love it! There are many others good movies too, like the silent ""Nosferatu"" which was an early version of ""Dracula,"" in which the vampire strikes me more like a creepy rodent than anything else; and silent films like ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" and ""Phantom of the Opera."" All worth a look, all of historical interest (if you have any interest at all in how film, especially scary film, developed over the decades) and many of which are hard to find individually. Also ""White Zombie,"" another very old movie, very effective, with Bela Lugosi doing his best suave-but-sinister routine.

And yeah there's some crud. The thing is, what I call crud and what you call crud will be two different piles of crud. (I didn't care much for ""Dementia 13,"" which some people love; it was Francis Ford Coppola's first movie but I just thought it was kind of dull.) There are easily a dozen very good or even greatly entertaining movies in this set, which breaks down to about a buck twenty per movie; plus some so-so ones and some others you might not get ten minutes into. That sounds like a pretty good deal to me, folks. I don't mind a few speckles and a little wonky sound. Just adds to the atmosphere...

Can we all complain a little less, please?",1169424000,5,2507,4.667420814479638
2002410,2,B0001HAGTM,"I'm not much of a horror fan at all.  Still, I figured fifty movies for 11 dollars or so was a must-have.  I saw advertisements on TV for just such a deal (20 dollars instead) but I already knew this was a different one (since the TV one had more modern ones with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing)

But this ""deal"" is pretty much a ""you get what you pay for"" sort of thing.  The DVDs are dual-sided and put in thin cardboard slips with labels on the outside telling you what movie it is, what it's about, how long, what year, and lead actor.

All pretty good, but many of the DVDs I received (when purchased NEW) had bits of the foil scratched off on the edges and near the center, resulting in movies that started to get pixely and screwed up pictures for up to a minute or so in the film.  Not quite enough to ruin the entire picture, but I've only watched two movies from it so far (The Phantom of the Opera and White Zombie) and I considered returning the whole thing because of this.

Aside from the damage to many of my NEW discs, which appears to be the work either of shoddy packaging or someone literally tossing the package up and down in the air and using it as an impromptu football down at the packaging plant in Indonesia or wherever.  I could tolerate ruination in some of the movies, but not ALL of them or MOST of them or even HALF of them.

I will keep it---for now---and hope the rest aren't as badly damaged.  Also I regret getting this one, as most of what it contains are campy ""classics"" from the 50s and 60s including ""Random Amazon Woman from Uranus"" (fake title) and ""One Arm Too Many"" and ""The Body Sniffer"" and other such gems of titles.  There are no Draculas, no Frankensteins, no Ghosts, no Christopher Lee or Peter Cushings, few Boris Karloffs, some Bela Lugosis, and not so much Vincent Price.

This only gets two stars because of the price, and because they've managed to pile in some good ones, including Metropolis, which isn't a horror movie.",1168992000,13,1980,4.350543478260869

It is unfair to compare the quality of vintage movies to more recent flicks, or to have an expectation that the special effects would be as sophisticated as they are today. To me it's much more disappointing to watch a modern movie with poor effects and a terrible storyline. There's no excuse for it except, perhaps, the lack of a decent budget.

2002436,2,B0001HAGTM,"We have watched all of the movies in this collection. Some of the movies (about 1/3) are either inaudible (hard to understand what the actors are saying) and/or skip parts (words/scenes) because the film is so old. My husband and I watched at least 3 of the movies per week, and what strikes us most is that many of the films in this ""horror"" collection are nowhere near the ""horror"" movies we watched on Saturday Matinees at the movies in the 60s. Over half belong in the ""mystery"" or ""comedy"" category. And what's with all the gorillas? Every fifth movie it seems has a gorilla in it.

These horror movies are from the 20s to the 60s and are much more tame than todays horror flicks, granted. But, come on, why should we have to sit through a movie where the quality is awful and the movie is not a horror movie? Sure the movies were cheap in dollar value, but the time spent watching half of the set was not worth it.

Again, there were too many gorillas! Not that there's anything wrong with gorillas, but we prefer ghosts to gorillas.",1160524800,17,1039,4.40625
2002437,5,B0001HAGTM,"Although I had a good portion of these movies from collections I bought from DVD bargain bins, the price was very reasonable to justify getting about 35 new horror classics added to my collection.

With the DVD market collapsing, I doubt that we will see such a collection of forgotten classics ever again.  I finished watching the first disc, and I would say that 2 of the 4 films on it are considered great (""Carnival of Souls"" and ""Nightmare Castle"").  Even the other 2 (""Creature from the Haunted Sea"" and ""Atom Age Vampire"") have more than enough entertainment value to keep you watching until the end.  Sure, the picture quality and the synchronization of audio is not 100%, but considering the target market and the budget, this is a reasonable tradeoff.

The great thing about these forgotten classics is that I am discovering films that I have never heard of, and I would argue that they are better than the more modern horror movies.

EDIT:  Since I wrote my review, I've noticed other 50 movie packs being released which kind of contradicts my statement ""we'll never see another collection like this again"".  Although I don't expect them to be as good as this one, I will definitely buy one or more of them.

EDIT #2: I have ordered 2 more 50 movie packs: ""Nightmare Worlds"" and ""Tales of Terror"".  It will probably be a while before I get to watch these as I am only about 60% of the way through the current collection (Horror Classics).  Keep in mind, there are quite a few stinkers, some of these are not even horror stories (more like detective mystery stories).

Another example is The World Gone Mad about a murdered District Attorney who investigated a financial fraud and the reporter trying to find the killer(s).

Nosferatu, Chaney's Hunchback of Notre Dame and Phantom of the Opera, Night of the Living Dead,

Metropolis, John Barrymore's Jekyll & Hyde. And while it's great to settle in knowing you'll be watching

a classic, it's a different kind of fun altogether popping in an old B-movie horror flick you've never

heard of & not knowing whether you'll end up cringing in fright or laughing hysterically -- or both. So

many of the ""old"" horror movies from the 50s & 60s teetered on that brink between scary and hilarious --

but no matter which way it fell, it was almost always entertaining.

Getting scared watching horror movies used to be fun. Today though, with all the gory slasher pics, you

just get grossed out, mortified, and/or nauseated. But no slasher bloodbaths here (so far) -- what a

relief. I've watched about 1/4 of them and have hours & hours more to go. What a great deal, and what a

Many of these movies are on other sets.  For example many of the Lugosi films such as White Zombie, The Corpse Vanishes, etc, are easily obtainable.  Also found often is Night of the Living Dead, CArnival of Souls, The Giant Gila Monster, House on Haunted Hill, and a few others.  But then there are those that you simply don't see all that often.

King of the Zombies with the always hilarious Mantan Moreland; Dead Men Walk, one of George Zucco's few starring roles; A Shriek in the Night with Ginger Rogers; The Monster Walks; The Amazing Mr. X with Turhan Bey;  The atmostpheric ""The Bat"" with Fay Wray; and The Monster Maker.

These and a few others represent little known horror classics which, for the most part, did not star the typical horror films stars like Karloff or Lugosi.  The Bat is really a fine, and very atmospheric horror, very reminiscent of early Universal horrors.  Sure there is some schlocky losers, particularly among some of the 50's era films but this is still a great set.",1134086400,8,1219,4.597222222222222

However if you're an old school ghoul who values a buck and a healthy dose of cinematic cheese then this is definately your pot of gruesome gold. The quality is iffy at times and in true exploitation fashion the Bait and Switch method is used on several titles that sound good but turn out to be crime dramas or drawing room mystery comedies. It don't matter really as you get to see Boris Karloff pretend to be Charlie Chan and that's worth forty cents an episode. I owned half the movies already and I still found it to be a good value. A couple of the films turned out to be widescreen while my previously purchased more expensive copies were flat 16mm TV prints. The Print for Metropolis unfortunately is really awful but you're not buying this set for class,you're buying it for the films you can't tape off of TCM and so what if not all the films are winners .

2002481,4,B0001HAGTM,"If you're the type of person who loved staying up late at night to watch obscure horror movies, this DVD set is probably right up your alley. Virtually every film collected here started off as a Double Feature and then ended up as the Late Late Movie on local TV. There are some geniune classics here, like 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Carnival of Souls,' as well as a large assortment of worthwhile cult oddities like 'The Brain that Wouldn't Die' and 'Nightmare Castle' and Saturday afternoon schlock like 'House on Haunted Hill.' And, of course, there's Bela Lugosi in the eerie 'White Zombie,' along with several of his weaker efforts.

I highly recommend this DVD set but would like to offer a few caveats that aren't totally clear from the product description.

1)A handful of these films (like 'Nosferatu' and 'Phantom of the Opera')are silent movies. If you don't like silent movies this is a drawback. They also don't have extended or interesting musical scores added to them. I suggest turning the sound down and listening to something by Goblin or Tangerine Dream instead

2)Only four of the fifty films are in color. These include 'The Terror' and 'Monster from a Prehistoric Planet.' Ironically these are among the weakest films.

3)For the most part, these are well-worn TV prints. There are plenty of visible scratches in many of the films, and lots of harsh mono sound. To me, these flaws are part of the charm of these old movies in the same way that pops and crackles on old vinyl are charming. You might not agree. I've seen cleaner versions of 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Carnival of Souls' elsewhere, but I doubt that the original negatives still exist for most of these movies, so restoration might be impossible. Regardless, if you're hoping to see the gorier, sexier versions of Italian dubbed shockers like 'Atom Age Vampire' and 'Nightmare Castle,' you're out of luck, my friend.

4)Some of these films, like 'Vampire Bat' and the Mr Wong movies starring Boris Karloff, are really supernaturally-themed mysteries rather than true horror films.

I can't tell you how much I'm enjoying this collection of low-tech, old school creepy movies. They may be for an acquired taste, but if you collected Famous Monsters as a kid you'll want to snatch up a copy of this set while they last!",1128902400,31,2313,4.798994974874372

staples such as ""Nosferatu"" to cult classics Such as "" The

Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Carnival of Souls"", To schlock

stock such as ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" (arguably one of the

worst movies I have ever seen... in an interesting way).

These movies aren't perfect, neither in their content, nor their

reproduction...and therein lies the charm. Occasionally a film

may have a white line or dots momentarily peppering it's surface.

Sometimes...the audio seems distant....easily fixed.

Their imperfection takes one back to a different time. One of

saturday night, Chiller Theater,(forgive my pittsburgh reference

experiencing this for the first time...good for you! This is

probably spent more for the popcorn... than the feature.

2002487,5,B0001HAGTM,"Look, I already owned 38 of the movies in this 50 movie pack. I bought it anyway and am NOT disappointed! In the world of ""public domain"" movies, lots of DVD companies sell tons of these films in countless packages at many different prices. For example, I've seen copies of the movie THE GORILLA ranging in price from $8-$30, while the same flick on this set amounts to less than a buck! Not bad, huh?! Well, every movie in this entire collection can be found individually, at very high prices! I should know, I bought most of 'em before this set came out! This set is by far the best value out there! The quality of these movies varies (of course), but is as good or better than the copies being sold for up to ten times as much! For instance, the version of ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES in this set is widescreen and has fewer blips or skips than my other two versions. Even the sound is better in these flicks, with less muffled dialogue! I have paid more than I should for too long. Don't make the same mistake! Buy this sucker now! BEWARE: As always, be careful when buying ""public domain"" movie collections, as some titles are known to come and go on various editions! Check w/ the distributer to get the latest line-up. This review is for the original release, w/ the ""white spooky face on black background"" box art...",1116979200,17,1324,4.408163265306122
2002488,5,B0001HAGTM,"When I picked this set up at a zellers in winnipeg, I new I was in for some good cheesy fun. I hav'ent seen all of them, some of them I had already seen. I would have done it a bit differently, for instance, I would have substituted THE SCREAMING SKULL with PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, & I would have put DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS  in there as well. My personal favourites of the set are as follows: THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES, THE BRAIN THAT WOULD'NT DIE, THE KILLER SHREWS, THE  GIANT GILA MONSTER, DEMENTIA 13, METROPOLIS, THE LITTLT SHOP OF HORRORS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD & SWAMP WOMEN. Sure, a few of these movies can't be considered ""HORROR MOVIES"" per say, but they are great fun none the less. So if you are a horror or schlock fan, do yourself a favour & pick this one up.",1115683200,6,799,4.115384615384615

I can't return it because the entire thing fell apart the second I took it out of the box.
