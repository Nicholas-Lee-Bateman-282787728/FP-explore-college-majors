4897847,5,B005VUTRDU,"Linda Howard does an exemplary job with this dvd.  I am a certified yoga teacher of over 30 years, and have had Linda teach for our Yoga Teacher Training Program for years in the area of Special Populations. This dvd is especially excellent but not limited to beginners, seniors, pregnancy, and those with chronic conditions.  She uses excellent principles of alignment to keep the body safe, is precise, mindful, and teaches with compassion and humor. It is amazing how much Linda has on this single dvd, it's a great value for the money. Linda's teaching is notably clear, direct, no-nonsense and professional that only comes from years of experience and a devotion to her own practice.",1334275200,14,688,4.922413793103448
4897848,5,B005VUTRDU,"Linda is an incredibly experienced instructor and professional that knows how to relate to normal folks that just want to feel better after a day of work.  I find her routines relaxing and refreshing, and they're a great way to wind down and calm the nerves.  As a healthy 27-year-old, you don't have to be elderly or sick to get something out of her teaching, and I'm impressed with yoga's ability to scale down and up to the student's level of ability.",1334275200,2,454,4.524390243902439
4897849,5,B005VUTRDU,"Having taken Linda Howard's yoga classes in person, I can honestly say that she is a top-notch instructor.  She understands how to adapt yoga to people of all ages and abilities.  Unfortunately, I'm not in her class at the moment but this DVD helps me to continue practicing yoga.

When I first popped in the disc, I was surprised to see many of the same routines and poses we performed in class.  Lessons cover a wide variety of topics and typically range from 15-30 minutes.  The lessons don't require you to be a contortionist, nor do they assume you are inflexible.  Instead, Linda encourages her viewers to do what works for them, while giving adjustments for those with injury and tips for those who are more advanced.  I found the lessons perfect for someone who has a busy schedule or someone who wants to explore the benefits of yoga.  I also found that the relaxation exercises really help to chill me out after a stressful day.  Warning: do not operate heavy machinery after doing them.  :)",1334188800,,1001,4.636363636363637
4897850,5,B005VUTRDU,"As a yoga teacher I found this video very instructive. Linda Howard is articulate and concise in the what, why and how of the poses she leads us through. I loved watching the knowing and respectful way she adjusts her students. Also instructive are the modifications given for many poses. Linda's use of props is innovative. She is skillful while effortlessly teaching to a wide variety of student needs. The video comes with a modification menu with an extensive list of conditions where adaption makes the poses doable for a wider population of students. She teaches how to tune in to what motions provoke and what motions relieve pain and has a common sense approach to teaching that allows yoga to be of help rather than harm while recovering from injury and other health concerns. I love the modifications by pose menu as it goes through the poses, gives you modifications for the poses and most beneficial (to me) - the 'why' of why we are doing this modification. She gives you the pose, benefits of the pose, modifications for the pose and the reasons why you would want to modify the pose and props needed to modify the pose.

As a yoga student I found the video informative, restful and relaxing. Linda's voice is smooth and clear, not once did I have to wonder what she was saying or talking about. In this current age of yoga videos, this is a real gift to the student. The yoga nidra alone is well worth the price of admission to this class. The video is well organized and easy to navigate.

This video is taught and spoken with the voice and insight of an experienced and knowledgeable teacher.",1334102400,3,1609,4.602787456445993
4897851,5,B005VUTRDU,"This is truly a DVD that will ""Ease You Into Yoga"".  The instructions are clear and concise.  You are presented with Progressive Lessons and ways to Modify the various postures.  (Some of the reasons for modifications are:  Elderly, Athletic, Overweight, Pregnant, Chronic Conditions.)  I became interested in yoga when a boss told me how much yoga had helped his flexibility and balance.  (We had desk-sitting jobs.)  I started buying yoga DVD's, but couldn't even get started with the postures.  ""Easing Into Yoga with Linda Howard"" has helped me in so many ways.  I highly recommend it!",1330732800,32,589,5.052083333333333
4897852,5,B005VUTRDU,"This DVD is an excellent introduction for a beginner to yoga, or even someone who is unable to attend a class in person but needs careful, thorough, friendly instruction. The amount of material included on this disc is remarkable compared to other DVDs--6 sequential classes with detailed instruction, 4 practices to do after learning the poses, a guided yoga nidra, and a TON on information on general modifications for special conditions and very specific suggestions for modifying individual poses. All presented in a warm, knowledgeable fashion. Amazing value for the price!",1330473600,22,578,5.362637362637362
4897853,5,B005VUTRDU,This DVD is excellent. I'm a yoga teacher preparing to teach a gentle/seniors class so I've been gathering additional sources of inspiration. I'd highly recommend your DVD to other yoga teachers - as well as to students. Linda provides lots of options and excellent instruction -- thank you for this thoughtful practice!,1329696000,2,320,5.173076923076923
4897854,5,B005VUTRDU,"Finally, there is a yoga DVD that I can enthusiastically recommend to my students for their home practice.  I teach a very gentle therapeutic style of yoga to students who have many physical challenges, such as MS, joint replacement recovery, cancer recovery, heart disease, Fibromyalgia, diabetes...and more.  Easing Into Yoga teaches a very SAFE yoga that would I fully trust with my students.  Linda Howard is an outstanding teacher and truly understands people's limitations and the pain they deal with.",1329609600,3,507,5.3125
4897855,4,B005VUTRDU,This is a great for those who want to shape up and relax,1414627200,,56,3.3846153846153846
4897856,5,B005VUTRDU,"I am an occupational therapist with children and have been doing yoga, taught by a physical therapist, for over 10 years.  I often use yoga poses in treatment with my young patients and have found that holding a yoga pose can improve strength more than doing repetitions focused at the same muscle group.  Recently, I was looking for a yoga DVD for a teen with Down's Syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis and came across this one on an arthritis website.  Although I have not watched the entire DVD, I have watched about 30 minutes of the first session and watched the knee modifications explanation.  In watching that much, I found several tidbits to integrate into my work with children who could never do a traditional yoga class, including an easy and effective chest opener that can be done in a chair.  I highly recommend this DVD for those who are just beginning yoga, or any exercise program, and want to begin slowly and in the privacy of their own home.  This probably isn't for athletes and it's not the athletic club-brand of yoga for people who already are super flexible but it's a great place to start.",1414022400,2,1114,4.658163265306122

4897859,5,B005VUTRDU,I could have used this this after cancer treatments since I was very stiff and trying to get mobile again.  I'm past most of these moves now but its still relaxing and good for my mother who needs to move around but can't do too much due to pain,1400544000,2,245,4.0
4897860,2,B005VUTRDU,"I wasn't too happy with this purchase, so gave it to someone who does yoga a lot.  The DVD was hard to follow.",1394755200,2,110,3.782608695652174
4897861,5,B005VUTRDU,"This is the BEST DVD I have ever seen to use without an in-studio class. The menu is superb and extremely easy to use. The various ""classes"" are simple to follow at home and give one a terrrific workout. This yoga teacher is incredible.
Anyone, beginner or not, will love this and use it regularly.",1391212800,2,298,4.4363636363636365
4897862,5,B005VUTRDU,"This is a great DVD for beginners, my husband has Parkinsons and this is aiding in providing extra flexibility and mobility for him.",1389312000,6,132,4.782608695652174
4897863,3,B005VUTRDU,Nice that there are so many options and she really walks you through the steps and different ways to do each. So far this hasn't been as intensive as I'd like. Great if you have injuries or disabilities where you can't do regular yoga though.,1388361600,4,242,4.4
4897864,1,B005VUTRDU,"The entire video is  chair exercises.  I thought they would have at least one person in the group on a mat but there's only a couple of times where it shows how to do from a mat instead of a chair. Totally concur with an earlier review that it is PAINFULLY SLOW.  The six ""sessions"" are repeats of previous sessions with an added element.  This was a huge waste of money and should only be purchased by someone who is physically unable to do a floor workout.  Could have done without the closeups of the gnarled toenails too.",1388275200,7,525,4.316326530612245
4897865,4,B005VUTRDU,I bought this for my 70 yr old mother who is not very active but is healthy.  It is a bit beneath her abilities.  Linda talks and reassures way too much for me but I could see very frightened impaired beginners needing this encouragement.  There is very little meditation or connecting movement to breathing that is usually associated with yoga.  I do like that the lessons are based on body areas starting with feet.  There are poses and exercises that I have never seen before. I'd call these lessons more of a combination of restorative poses plus some range of motion exercises than any sort of traditional yoga.,1387324800,,616,4.666666666666667
4897866,5,B005VUTRDU,"This is an outstanding dvd for the beginner yoga student.  The poses are explained and demonstrated with thoughtfulness and skill along with modifications.  As a yoga teacher myself for many years, this would be one of the few dvd's I would recommend to beginners.  The instructor has a very thorough knowledge of anatomy and proper form.  I think too often, the fine practice of yoga gets muddled in to what is *popular* in the US and this stays true to the practice of yoga and listening to your body.  I highly recommend this dvd!!",1385856000,2,534,4.638297872340425
4897867,1,B005VUTRDU,"This is a video of a POOR Teacher who is teaching her regular routine class. The students all know what to do before the teacher even speaks so the position is done and over before the teacher even has a chance or tries to teach us at home, ""The beginners"". The teacher is not helpful at all in telling the home audience how to do the position  and what it is for. This is the WORST EVER. The Children's Yoga DVD's are so much better for me even as an adult and my granddaughter does it with me. Best ones are Kids Word Yoga and Storyland Yoga. Adults out there new to Yoga, I highly recommend these last two. Don't push yourself just try and in 3 days you will start to feel better by 2 weeks you will see that you are able to do more poses correctly thus improved results. ( I am 60)
I wouldn't recommend trying to do headstands like some of the children do.
The children are a great inspiration.",1385078400,6,898,4.131428571428572
4897868,5,B005VUTRDU,This is a wonderful basic yoga DVD for students of all levels and abilities. Linda's clear and basic instructions give the student the opportunity to enjoy the process. I highly recommend it to students who are chair bound.,1382140800,,223,4.894736842105263
4897869,5,B005VUTRDU,"I was introduced to Yoga after having a total knee replacement. Being an avid hiker, cyclist and gym rat, I really did not understand  my loss  of flexibility over the years... The knee replacement soon pointed this out that more than muscle strength was important.
I investigated Yoga and in some cases I found DVDS, classes etc. that were intimidating and not empathetic to my flexibility needs and in some cases dangerous due to the pressure to go beyond what my body would tolerate. Yoga is a series of small steps gradually increasing your bodies flexibility.
This DVD proved to be a great choice for me as a beginner... The progressive lessons start you out with small steps and move you along at your own pace. The implicit goal is a small step forward as your body will allow. Linda does a great job of encouraging your progress and is not judgmental with a standard  set of progress goals. The goals and pace are yours.
While I noted some of the reviews stated the DVD is too slow. I strongly disagree since you set the pace. It is much safer physically to follow the detailed instruction with modifications for your unique conditions and progress as your body allows. It will be slow at first but as you break thru various stages and realize the added flexibility, relaxation and satisfaction- you will realize it was worth the effort. Do not be frustrated if your first efforts seem to be not what you expected. The key is perseverance- success will follow.",1381622400,,1468,4.66023166023166
4897870,2,B005VUTRDU,I am a beginner and I found this to be painfully slow. I also had a hard time with some of the poses as I am overweight. There wasn't enough explanation for them at times.,1378944000,2,171,3.914285714285714
4897871,4,B005VUTRDU,"After being diagnosed with arthritis, my doctor suggested yoga and swimming as effective treatments.  Leary of being able to do any yoga poses, I looked for the simplest sounding beginning yoga dvd and decided on this one.  You go at your own pace and she makes the instructions easy to understand.  There are many alternate moves if you have physical issues that keep you from doing the typical poses.",1378252800,4,402,4.797101449275362

4897874,5,B005VUTRDU,"I have severe arthritis in the knees and needed something to help until and then after surgery.  This is something I CAN do!  I'm thrilled.  If you have special needs -- arthritis, injury or pregnancy, this has a complete modification menu.  It's probably not for those who have no physical limitation outside of poor fitness but for those of us who are physically limited it's perfect.",1376524800,3,386,4.803030303030303
4897875,5,B005VUTRDU,"This is a fantastic dvd. If you can sit in a chair, you can start doing yoga! Because of that, I've sent copies of this dvd to my mother-in-law (who is not very mobile) and to my favorite Aunt (who is mobile but she's also 85!) I have my own copy & I've done it with my children. Even my husband loves this dvd. It's a great way to get started, a wonderful introduction. But please, don't let that put you off if you're an experienced yogi or yogini! Linda has many years of yoga experience & had made a program that is as hard as you make it. I've taken yoga classes for years from many teachers & I've bought many yoga dvd; I've taken yoga that's hot, with gong ringers, chanters & huggers. Nothing has been as enjoyable as Linda's program. She is clearly knowledgeable. I can't recommend this dvd highly enough!",1376352000,3,814,4.292207792207792
4897876,4,B005VUTRDU,"I chose this Yoga DVD based upon the Arthritis Foundation thumbs up and some of the reviews.  I'm hoping this will help my Mom's arthritis as well as both of our flexibility, etc.  I've only watched it a couple of times - sort of reviewing it - to see if how good it would be.  I liked Linda Howard's presentation of all of the different poses, talking through them and all of that. She is quiet, very articulate (if you are hard of hearing, but a good lip-reader, you could easily follow along), and good with the explanations. I found her easy to understand and follow.  I would give it a five, but the only CON is that is goes pretty fast - at least, for me as a first timer in yoga. I was just getting set with the exercise when she says something to the effect that if it was stiff or hurt, you would spend more time on it, and suddenly she's in the next pose.  It may not seem so fast, once I learn the poses and really get started in it.
Overall, an excellent DVD.",1375833600,13,971,4.089473684210526
4897877,5,B005VUTRDU,Excellent choice for someone trying yoga for the first time. The modifications are available separately so you can quickly refer to them. Plus members of the class often perform the poses with modifications.,1374796800,,207,5.303030303030303

4897879,5,B005VUTRDU,"I had purchased this DVD when I starting working out again, knowing i be swore i decided to try buying a yoga dvd since it was cheaper and not as much commitment as a real class. I came across this wonderful dvd when i was looking for a easy way to get into yoga since i was very new with in the first 10 mins i knew this was a great dvd i even suggested this too a few friends and they loved it to sometimes we do yoga nights.

Her experience as a therapeutic yoga teacher really shines through and she is able to help students with all kinds of health issues still feel part of a class.

4897881,5,B005VUTRDU,"This DVD puts into fine form the wonderful teaching of a gifted Iyengar Yoga teacher.  Although Linda Howard is a ""teacher of teachers"" her career-long focus has been to provide the benefits of proper posture and stretches to aging and injured individuals.  I know from personal experience in her classes the power and rewards of such instruction.  Yoga is in part a frame of mind, and Linda's instruction is filled with both clarity and lightheartedness.  She emphasizes safety in all postures and teaches how to listen to your body for indications of what is ""enough"", and then to be satisfied with your efforts.  The variety of simple postures extends capabilities and function for most if not all major muscle groups and joints.  The results soothe body and mind, and I believe, extend active life in the only body we are given.  Highly recommended for young and old, fit and degenerate, stiff and flexible.",1372291200,6,911,4.915032679738562

But Linda Howard offers so many variations for various ailments or limitations that I could literally ""ease into yoga."" Because the levels increased my confidence, I was compelled to continue and renew my yoga practice. Linda's encouraging and clear instructions made it seem as if a friend were in my living room.

But not too much too fast - when I have a slight set back, I can always go back to easing into the practice and get back into a good groove.

I love that this DVD includes modifications for those of us with a few aches and pains. I had to give yoga up a few years ago due to low back pain, but now with this DVD I'm able to make the appropriate modifications when needed and enjoy yoga again. And I feel better! Whether you have physical restrictions or are in the best of shape, this video provides a great no-nonsense approach to yoga.

The DVD is easy to follow, very straightforward with clear instructions. The instructor moves at a good pace and provides helpful hints along the way. I like that it focuses on yoga and how to avoid injuries while maintaining correct posture, etc. rather than some of the 'fluff' I've seen in other videos.

4897891,5,B005VUTRDU,"This really is an exceptional DVD and includes hours of various yoga instruction focusing mainly on the beginner, although the experience yogi will certainly find benefit too.

The DVD has a very detailed menu system that is easy to navigate. There is a brief introduction called ""Before You Begin"" which is really helpful to get you started with the basics of setting up your yoga practice area. Then, a ""Modification Menu"" which includes just about every body issue and level of focus including athletic, elderly, fatigued, overweight, pregnant, stability/balance, ankles & feet, knees, low back, upper neck & back, shoulders, wrists, chronic conditions. These sections include short video and information/advice and just about everything you could need relating to yoga and these issues.

Also included is a ""Modifications by Posture"" which is a series of photos with no audio. This section includes: chest openers, hip openers, twists, leg stretches, mountain pose, downward dog pose, lunge, warrior 2, triangle, and tree. Then, ""Modifications for the Advanced"" including these postures: bridge, bound angle, half-moon, head to knee, lateral flank, plank, relaxation, side turning, vasistasana, warrior 1 & 3, wide angle, wide angle forward bend. These sections are an excellent reference guide for your practices.

Wow, it a ton of information with just those features, but then the practices begin!

The main set of lessons are ""Progressive Lessons"" and really geared towards beginners and those with special issues. There are quite a few different types of students in the class that are shown throughout of various age and condition including elderly, pregnant, overweight, and both males and females. It's just like what you find in a real class, with real students (not just model yogi's).

There are 6 progressive lessons that vary in length from 44-64 minutes. These lessons are just like being in a class where Linda helps the students get into their poses. You can repeat each of these lessons or move on to the next lesson in the series ...it's very flexible :-)

The lessons are composed of separtely filmed segments which I don't typically care for, but on this DVD the transitions are quite smooth that you hardly notice that they're separate segments. I only wish there was a menu selection listing each of the segments so you could build your own practices to your likings or even a paper insert that lists each of the postures that are used in each class. You can always use the menu forward button to get to the next poses in each class, so this is not a major flaw.

After completing the series, or for those already familiar with yoga, there is the ""After Completing Progressive"" sections which include a short practice, short practice upper body, and deep relaxation Yoga Nidra each approximately 25 minutes. I LOVE the short practice and use it regularly for a nice morning or evening routine when I want to relax and unwind.

Linda's Yoga Nidra section is very intriguing. I have been practicing Yoga Nidra in various formats and especially like her approach. Yoga Nidra is sometimes called ""dream yoga"" which puts you into a very relaxed state of mind, very similar to how you feel during a 20-minute nap or right when you're on the edge of sleep. It is during this time that you will recover and rejuvenate yourself. She uses what's called Sankalpa which is kind-of like setting an intention and will help bring alignment to your essence. She does not walk you through a visualization like I am used to, but rather a focus on body awareness. If you are interested in more Yoga Nidra with visualization, my all-time favorite instruction is the audio CD by Swami Janakananda Saraswat called Experience Yoga Nidra.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Experience-Yoga-Nidra-Guided-deep-relaxation/dp/9163094886/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Experience Yoga Nidra: Guided deep relaxation</a>

Overall this is an excellent yoga practice DVD for just about any level. I found Linda Howard's voice very soothing, while her instructions are very direct, yet not overwhelming and she allows for nice pauses between postures. This is a must for anyone starting out or wanting to build a very comprehensive yoga/exercise DVD collection for hours of home practice. At $15 you absolutely can't go wrong with this purchase!",1338163200,50,4373,5.235714285714286
4897892,5,B005VUTRDU,"EASING INTO YOGA provides detailed descriptions of a wide range of poses. It also includes multiple sessions of increasing difficulty, though they are all relatively basic and slow-paced--perfect for yoga newbies or seniors or (as the title says) people who want to ease into yoga. Linda Howard is clearly the type of yoga instructor who wants her students to get the maximum out of each poses. It's not about being the most limber, or fastest or ""best""--it's about getting the poses right so that your body benefits. I can't tell you how many instructors I've had who didn't feel it was their job to explain poses or correct alignment--I'd rather do yoga to this video than with a live teacher who has her students do headstands without guidance or doesn't bother to fit in shivasana at the end. And I'm also keeping my fingers crossed for a sequel, so Linda can ease me into the next level!",1337299200,5,892,4.687898089171974
4897893,5,B005VUTRDU,"I was directed to Linda's video ""Easing Into Yoga"" by a facebook friend who had just discovered it herself.  I am so glad I followed up on the lead.  I am a yoga teacher interested in taking the summer off to devote to my family. But with a loyal following of yoga students, I felt I was letting them down.  Using this format on her video, they can easily adapt their home practice to suit their own needs.  Linda is easy to listen to, articulate and professional in her teaching.  The programs are dynamic in the ablity to progress through the sequences and levels.  I am a proponent of helping students help themselves develop their own practice and this is a wonderful tool I am happy to suggest to my students of all levels and abilities.",1335830400,12,742,4.419117647058823

8487681,5,B005VUTRDU,"I love this DVD. As someone with physical limitations (i.e., a human), I find that this DVD gives me a good workout along with lots of tips for keeping my body safe when I have something nasty happening in a shoulder or a knee or wherever.
I also teach yoga. I have incorporated a lot of the ""Easing Into Yoga"" techniques into my classes for all levels of students.
When a yoga student asks me to recommend a DVD, this is the one.",1485388800,,430,4.192771084337349

8487684,1,B005VUTRDU,The worst yoga video I've ever viewed- so boring and too much talking.,1438041600,2,70,4.461538461538462
8487685,3,B005VUTRDU,"First I should say that I recognize how deeply valuable this DVD is for a large community of folks who have never done yoga, and need very careful, point by point guidance on what to do and how to do it due to issues with many different kinds of pain.  If this is where you're coming from then this is probably a good DVD for you.  It wasn't right for me though, and in case anyone is coming from where I am, thought I should add my voice to the reviews.

I'm 30 and was diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis last year after chronic pain for 4 years.  Before it started, I had gotten deeply into yoga and loved it.  But over the last few years, trying to do even gentle poses on my own was causing me pain.  Recently I decided to look for yoga DVD routines that were specifically targeted for people with arthritis and chronic pain issues.  So it's because I'm familiar with yoga and have done it before in the past that this DVD was much too detailed for me.  Each routine is preceded by and interspersed with lectures that I found to be unnecessary - instead of a calming space where we simply try carefully guided poses, I spent a lot of time feeling like I was in a lecture hall.  Given that, it was sort of important that the person herself be soothing, but I found her a little off-putting - just wasn't a good match for me.  I plan on returning this because it was too basic.

As I said, for many people this might be extremely useful, but if you are at all familiar with yoga and have done it before and are struggling to get back into a practice you had to abandon due to chronic pain issues, this might not be the right one.  I would recommend Yoga for the Rest of Us by Peggy Cappy - I'm about to write a review for that DVD which I got at the same time as this one, and I found hers immensely and immediately helpful.",1437523200,5,1829,4.15014164305949

8487687,5,B005VUTRDU,"This dvd has proved to be an excellent choice for those who are just getting to know yoga. Linda Howard has a soothing voice and gives precise instructions. My mother and I enjoy this dvd very much and I would recommend it to anyone looking to start doing yoga. Keep in mind if you are just starting out you will need more than just a yoga mat. Get your self a few yoga blankets, a yoga strap, and even some blocks.",1424131200,2,415,4.135802469135802

8487689,4,B005VUTRDU,I purchased this as I am a rank beginner. The only thing I would change is a list on the packaging or product description that there are various props needed.
