8310790,5,B000HCO89U,"Excellent characters and intriguing plot make this volume of the acclaimed Inuyasha series one of the more entertaining.  Rumiko Takahashi adds a twist to this with the alleged ""an ancestor name Kagome"" written as part of the Hojo family line.

This episode also brings the beloved return of the clumsy but sweet Agitoki Hojo (featured in Inuyasha The Movie:The Castle Through The Looking Glass) with still a flame for our heroine Kagome, and together with all the lovable characters must save the heart of a scorned and betrayed demon with a difficult but familiar past.

This episode blends comedy, friendship, and the bonds of true love to get this exciting installment of Inuyasha, An Ancestor Named Kagome.",1168128000,,711,5.05982905982906
8310791,4,B000HCO89U,"Inuyasha and friends are running a little short of money and food and need a place to ply Miroku's patented fake exorcisms from a rich fool. But it turns out they might not have to make up a ghost this time as a strange intruder has been robbing rich people's houses and taking everything of value. Somehow, this thief is able to penetrate even the most impenetrable security. In exchange for food and lodging, the group agrees to catch the criminal, be he human or demon. After that it's the first two parts of a multiple episode story concluded on the next volume which has some ties to the modern world. In the present, Kagome is informed by her classmate, Hojo, that one of his ancestors from Inuyasha's time, Akitoki, married a girl named Kagome! Wouldn't you know that when Kagome returns to the feudal era, she runs into that very same ancestor. Akitoki is on a quest to purify the ""Kon Blade"", a cursed demonic weapon that his family is sworn to protect. But when a band of ninja demons start attacking him, he asks for help from Inuyasha and friends.

Anytime Shippo is the hero of an episode, it's fine by me, because you always know you're in for a laugh as evidenced in the first episode on this disk. You really feel for the kid, because beneath his surface sheen of cowardice, there is a brave heart that's bigger than his size. It's still kinda frustrating that Kagome can't figure out who she really likes. She even wonders if it's her destiny to marry the bumbling Akitoki. So much for faithfulness. There are some battles and the introduction of yet another gay demon, but this show gets by on the strength of its characters so the plot seems incidental. Actually, there isn't much plot, just conflict.",1166486400,,1720,4.566343042071197
