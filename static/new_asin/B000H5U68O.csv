2627299,1,B000H5U68O,"Do not buy this item if you have any appreciation for video transfer.  On many of the movies the sound and video quality is terrible.

On several movies it looks like someone made the video transfer from videotaping the movies while watching them on television.

Don't make the mistake I made.  In hindsight, I would only purchase this collection if I found it in a dollar bin sale, which is most likely where these Mill Creek collections will be in a year or so.",1171065600,15,463,4.476190476190476

2627301,5,B000H5U68O,"This sent contains a ton of movies and one of the great things about them are that a lot of them are ones that did not make it to being played often on TV.  It is by far not STAR WARS, but back when they made movies for story and effect and not special effects, one can enjoy them just for pure entertainment. They are perfect for a rainy day when you don't feel like doing anyting or watching any of those hi powered new flicks.  Or an easy kick back and relax just before bed.  And one does not have to have a lot of time as most of these are short (around 90 minuets).  They have not been enhanced and thus the quality of some are made from well used copies, but they are very watchable, and that old type quality adds some real authetics to the look and feel of them.  Though not for everyone, they do add a real nice touch to ones library for those that do like old movies.",1168300800,8,878,3.994285714285714
2627302,5,B000H5U68O,"NIGHTMARE WORLDS is one more public domain collection that's worth every penny! We know we're not getting mint prints from original masters, right? What we do get is a great variety of horror / sci-fi for hundreds of dollars less than other versions of the same movies (if you were to buy 'em all separately)! Here's the list- ALIEN CONTAMINATION- Watch chest caveties explode in this wondrous epic about killer egg-like pods! Good. ALIEN SPECIES- Computer generated ships attack, while most of the action takes place in a cave! Not bad for a cheapie! ATOMIC RULERS OF THE WORLD- Aliens threaten atomic catastrophe unless Starman (Ken Utsui) can save us! Ok. THE ALPHA INCIDENT- Boring story of a bio-weapon unleashed at a train depot in hillbillyland. Zzzz. ATTACK FROM SPACE- It's Starman to the rescue again! This time, the eeevil Spherions are up to no good! Ok. BEAST OF THE YELLOW NIGHT- John Ashley is forced (by the devil no less) to inhabit other men's bodies and destroy their lives. Not bad. Watch for the semi-psychedelic sex scene! WARRIORS OF THE WASTELAND- Mad Max done all wrong! Hilarious! Watch for the gut-busting ""death"" scenes! WEREWOLF WOMAN- A woman (Annek Borel) is plagued by memories of her rape, so she turns into a psychotic killer! The beginning is a scorcher, as Annek dances completely nude before turning into a hairy howler! Wow! THE NIGHTMARE NEVER ENDS- Indeed, this thing goes on forever! A demon nazi stalks the night, while Cameron Mitchell looks on. Horribly dull! COUNTERBLAST- A nazi scientist works on a plague to wipe out humanity, until falling in love w/ his assistant! Pretty decent actually. ALL THE KIND STRANGERS- Stacy keach stumbles upon a strange backwoods family of kids that holds him captive. He's their new daddy! Samantha Eggar, John Savage, and Robbie Benson also star! Good 70s made for TV creeper. THE DAY THE SKY EXPLODED- Asteroids are on a collision course w/ earth! Can the UN (ha ha) stop them in time? DEATH WARMED UP- A young man is injected w/ a secret serum, causing him to kill his parents w/ a shotgun! Years later, he returns w/ friends to seek vengeance on the doctor who injected him. Ok. Look out for the zombie horde! THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE- An awful, dull, steaming pile of nothingness! Earth is destroyed, so we send a ship to Venus, only to encounter sheer bloody boredom in space! Ugh! EMBRYO- Rock Hudson is a scientist who causes genetic mutations in a dog and then a beautiful gal (Barbara Carrera). Unfortunately, both subjects go homicidal! Good. END OF THE WORLD- Christopher Lee is an alien leader disguised as a priest w/ his gaggle of nuns! Will he destroy our beloved planet?? Good. ETERNAL EVIL- (aka: The Blue Man) has a guy leaving his body to kill people, or does he? Karen Black (Trilogy Of Terror, Burnt Offerings) co-stars. Ok. EVIL BRAIN FROM OUTER SPACE- Starman returns just in time to battle alien mutants in kung fu / disco dance routines! A riot! SHADOW OF CHINATOWN- Bela Lugosi is a eurasian fella who hates eurasians, and tries to kill them in chinatown. Ok. THE WAR GAME- Classic documentary-style film about the aftermath of nuclear war in England. Disturbing and great! IDAHO TRANSFER- Peter Fonda's low-key sci-fi story is an excellent time-travel, cautionary tale of ultimate doom! Great! GOOD AGAINST EVIL- A girl must escape from the devil's worshippers in order to live her own life. Dack Rambo stars. Ok. ALIEN ZONE- (aka: House Of The Dead) A man enters a mortuary during a storm, only to be treated to the mortician's stories about the occupants of three coffins! Ok. THE FURY OF THE WOLFMAN- Paul Naschy gets fuzzy once more, after his loving wife tries to kill him! Also features a sadistic scientist who wants Naschy for her love slave / murdering zombie! Ok. HOUSE OF THE LIVING DEAD- Gothic tale of soul migration, mad science, and murder! Ok. THE LOST CITY PTS. 1 AND 2- Seemingly endless movie (over 3 hrs) about the eeevil Zolok and his electronic doomsday device. We get giant zombies, slave traders, queen Rhama (she's a hottie), and more fights and jungle chases than any Tarzan movie! Ok. THE LOST WORLD- Silent classic has an expedition to a mysterious amazonian plateau where dinosaurs still roam! Great. THIS IS NOT A TEST- A group of strangers must band together on a lonely highway after a nuclear attack. Good. MENACE FROM OUTER SPACE- A Rocky Jones movie about possible alien invasion. Ok. MACISTE IN HELL- Silent movie w/ Maciste taking on an army of demons in hell itself! Pretty impressive for 1926! THE MISTRESS OF ATLANTIS- Brigitte Helm (Metropolis) mugs for the camera as the queen of Atlantis! She is unforgettable! Alas, the movie itself is not! NIGHT FRIGHT- John Agar must save a group of 30 year old ""teens"" from a mutant space monkey! Ok. HOW AWFUL ABOUT ALAN- Anthony Perkins (Psycho) plays a tormented man who goes blind after witnessing his father's death. Julie Harris (The Haunting) plays his sister. Good. PANIC- Slightly less edited version of a half- decent horror movie about a scientist infected by his own experimental bacteria. He (of course) goes on a murderous rampage! Ok. PIRANHA, PIRANHA- William Smith (Invasion Of The Bee Girls / Graveyard Tramps) is a lunatic hunter who takes an unwary group through the deep rainforests of Venezuela. Not bad. THE PHANTOM CREEPS- Bela attempts to conquer the world w/ his invisibility belt, spider-bombs, and a killer robot! Ok. PURPLE DEATH FROM OUTER SPACE- Flash Gordon epic finds Flash trying to stop a plague! Ok. PRISONERS OF THE LOST UNIVERSE- Not even Kay Lenz and John Saxon can save this sewer boat! Blah! RADIO RANCH- Condensed version of PHANTOM EMPIRE has Gene Autry and his singing cowboy friends battling an underground civilization bent on world conquest! Ok. THE RETURN OF DR. MABUSE- Yes, the devilish doctor is back, causing death and panic for inspector Lohman to deal with! Can he be stopped?? Good. ROBOT PILOT- Harmless fluff about a remote controlled plane. Forrest Tucker (The Crawling Eye) stars. RING OF TERROR- Blecch!! College med student is scared to death by a cadaver's hand. P-U! FROZEN ALIVE- Man frozen during cryogenics experiment is accused of murdering his wife. Ok. STAR ODYSSEY- Italian space adventure that takes elements of Star Trek and Star Wars and ruins them to great effect! Dumb but fun. TERROR AT THE RED WOLF INN- Years before The ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Motel Hell"", this movie used cannibalism and family ties w/ awesome results! A classic! THE MANSTER- A reporter is injected w/ a serum by a mad scientist in japan, causing him to turn into a monstrous murderer! Ok. THEY- A group trapped in a mountain cabin sit out the end of the world. Terrible! I fell asleep 3x! UNKNOWN WORLD- Scientist leads expedition to the earth's core to see if we can live there after nuclear holocaust. Ok. UFO TARGET EARTH- One of the most boring, idiotic movies ever made! Scientists investigate ufo sightings and the possibility of aliens living at the bottom of a lake! This ain't Mulder and Scully I assure you! Tedious to the point of suicide! Well, there it is. This collection is a winner! At this price, it's almost impossible to go wrong...",1159142400,303,7190,4.83685064935065

2627337,1,B000H5U68O,"i haven't watched them all. But from what I've seen so far....these AREN'T just the old 'fun-to-watch' sci-fi and horror movies. Be warned....several are down-right ""DISTURBING"". And, I'm in my 'later years and have seen just about everything imaginable on film. The movies run from the'downright ""BORING""....to the absolute ""SICK-AND-TWISTED!",1388966400,,343,5.88
2627338,2,B000H5U68O,These are low budget movies made between the 1930's and the 1990's.  The audio and video on these movies range from poor to mediocre. The real nightmare is that you can't see some of these movies because they are so dark or hear some of these movies because of the poor sound quality and that you paid good money for them.,1385769600,,322,4.278688524590164
2627339,2,B000H5U68O,"Movies are horribly bad; some are just unwatchable. Some of the cheesiest, low budget movies with terrible acting and
bad plots. There were about 5 that I actually liked, the rest stunk so bad I just could not watch the whole movie.

2627340,3,B000H5U68O,if you are looking for movies to laugh at lot for the scrips and the low quality this is your chance... firs one i wacht was so bad that i only wacht 15 min,1377388800,,156,3.6176470588235294
2627341,2,B000H5U68O,"While some of the movies are fun and nostalgic, the audio and video quality of most of them is terrible.  I found myself giving up on several of the movies simply because the video was so dark that you couldn't see anything, and the audio quality was so poor you couldn't understand what the actors were saying.  It's still a decent value for the money, but be prepared to discard a large proportion of the movies simply because they are barely watchable.",1365897600,2,455,4.536585365853658
2627342,4,B000H5U68O,"I am leaning towards the older movies from yesterday, some i remember only vaguely so to see them once again. Well, some are as good as i remember them yet others are not so good. The picture quality on some are not as good better on others the audio quality in some parts of these films are a little hard too hear but that does not detract that i really like these films. Considering that some of these gems were made way back in 1930- onwards if you are mad like me and like something different then this could be a pack for you i hope this review helps people  wayne shepherd",1359676800,,578,4.160714285714286
2627343,3,B000H5U68O,"The average Mill Creek collection usually has one or two movies you might like to own, a score of second rate films, another score of third rate movies, and a few films which are so hard to sit through that you probably won't ever see their endings. ""NIghtmare Worlds"" is about average for a Mill Creek collection, with more reliance on using television movies and compressed serials as filler than normal. The collection does have one feature I like very much, which is the use of clearly labeled DVD sleeves which have brief synopsis of each of the movies on a particular two-sided disc which a particular sleeve is meant to hold; the system is far better than the tiny print on each DVD and easy to lose contents booklets which come with most Mill Creek 50 Movies collections. It's far easier to find a specific film. The bad news is there may not be too many of the movies that you'll want to see more than once.

 The gems (in my opinion) in ""Nightmare Worlds"" are: the 1932 lyrical fantasy ""The Mistress of Atlantis"" which places Atlantis under the Sahara Desert; the dystopian eco-disaster movie ""Idaho Transfer"" which features a cast of unknowns  (Keith Carridine being the exception) and the unique idea of stationary time machines, directed by Peter Fonda, which is as fascinating as it is depressing; the 1925 silent ""The Lost World"" which features Wallace Beery in the first film adaption of an Arthur Conan Doyle novel which spawned many imitations; ""This is Not A Test,"" which is an extremely bleak nuclear paranoia movie made in 1962 for the Drive-In circuit and never released; the 1970 made-for-television ""How Awful About Allen"" which features Anthony Perkins in an intelligent and intelligently directed mystery with some horror elements.

 The second rate movies include ""Embryo"" which features Rock Hudson and Barbara Carrera's nipples in a rather dull cautionary tale about cloning; an American production ""The Manster"" which was made in Japan with a largely Japanese cast and crew and contains some wonderfully surreal touches but is a little too long for its own good; ""Terror at the Red Wolf Inn"" which is a black humor cannibal comedy which is so dark it isn't funny nor particularly memorable; ""All the Kind Strangers,"" which features Stacy Keach, and several young actors who eventually had much better roles, gallently trying to overcome a poor script. Third rate movies include: the Spanish ""Fury of the Wolf Man""; several bowderized and compressed movie serials (the beat of which is Gene Autry's first work, ""The Hidden Empire,"" retitled as ""Radio Ranch""); the incredibly slow moving ""Prisoner of the Lost Universe""; the forgetable made-for-televison ""Good Against Evil""; ""End of the World"" which wastes the talents of Christopher Lee.

 There are several movies that you'll either skip over after a few minutes or which will put you to sleep in thirteen minutes: the Filapino ""Beast of the Yellow Night""; the made-for-television ""Disappearance of Flight 412""; several Starman movies featuring Ken Utsui as a Japanese super hero who fight very fanciful menaces; ""The Severed Arm"" which is obviously missing its last few minutes; ""Werewolf Woman"" manages to make gratitous nudity, sex, and violence mind numbing. There are also a few movies which aren't particularly bad or particularly good which turn up too often on Mill Creek and other Public Domain collections (""Night Fright"" with the long in the tooth John Agar, for example).

 If you want a lot of movies at a cheap price, Mill Creek collections seem like a bargain. If you're willing to sift through what often seems like too many random movies, chances are high you will find three to six movies that you'll like well enough to consider the collection a fair deal.",1356220800,4,3756,4.968152866242038
2627344,1,B000H5U68O,these dics are of poor quailty and not to say the films are some of the worst crap made. I happen to love sci/fi and this is the stuff that make you re-think what do you really like.,1354752000,,182,3.8157894736842106
2627345,1,B000H5U68O,"Again, the picture and sound quality is a torture for the eye and ear! The colors are grey and green. It's a very very bad VHS tape picture, black on the edges! Very ugly!",1354233600,,171,4.0588235294117645
2627346,5,B000H5U68O,If you like low buget si fi movies. This is for you. I am suprised I have not see a lot of these. Im happy.,1353024000,,107,3.32
2627347,5,B000H5U68O,Great movies of my youth. It keeps it alive.,1348531200,,44,4.0
2627348,3,B000H5U68O,"I decided to get this without the foreknowledge that it is mostly bad horror movies, not strictly sci-fi. Had I known it was mostly bad horror and not sci-fi I probly would not have ordered it because I am not a big fan of horror, especially bad horror that is nothing more than violent sensationalism. Of course, with a title like ""Nightmare Worlds"" I should have known better, but the reviews I read didn't actually point out the fact that they were mostly bad horror movies, so i really did not know.

Most of the color videos are horror movies from the 70s and 80s and most of the B&W videos are a mixture of horror and ancient B-movies from the 30s, 40s, and 50s. Some of the ancient B-movies are early sci-fi adventures which include Buck Rogers, Rocky Jones, and Starman (Japanese).

The best movies in this collection, imo, are actually some of the old B&W movies; The Lost City, The Phantom Creeps (w/ Bela Lugosi), Purple Death from Outer Space (Buck Rogers), and This is Not a Test, etc... As most of the color movies are bad horror, I cannot be the best judge of which exactly are the best, but I probly would pick the ones that include aliens from outer space rather than mutants and psycho-killers. Unfortunately, most are about mutants and psycho-killers so there aren't many aliens from outer space in this collection. The exceptions are Alien Species,  Idaho Transfer, Prisoners of the Lost Universe, The Disappearance of Flight 412,  Warriors of the Wasteland, and The Alpha Incident.

So my advice to anyone who is looking for a good deal on bad horror movies, this is it, but anyone looking for a good deal on sci-fi B-movies, then they should get the Sci-Fi Invasion Collection.",1345161600,3,1699,4.65
2627349,4,B000H5U68O,"No doubt about it, this collection is worth every cent.  Forget Criterion, forget AMC Movie Classics, forget wide-screen, remastered, forget all of that stuff.  This set of truly ""classic"" classless films is so much fun to watch.  What could any such set be without John Agar or Ralph Meeker (of ""Paths of Glory"").  I am reminded of many now-famous filmmakers's early or student attempts, using their fellow classmates and borrowed cameras.  There are excellent examples of how NOT to pace the action or the use of zoom lenses or padding the narrative with long chases or cars or airplanes taking off and landing.  In fact, any student of filmmaking could learn a great deal from studying these movies.
So, if your girlfriend walked out on you, or your friends have all forsaken you, or you've lost you job, just settle down with a six pack (or two), microwave some popcorn, and settle back for many evenings of video pleasure.  If you are tired of all of the documentaries about ""Citizen Kane"" or Bergman boxed sets, and just want a few hours of mindless relaxation, this 50 mega set is the perfect solution.
Please don't misunderstand me:  this review is very, very positive.  If you are used to fine dining, a good old hot dog is often a bit of a relief.  A hamburger at a truck stop can be culinary heaven, under the right circumstances.  I have a plan to have a ""salon"" with a few of my ""real"" friends once or twice a month to just hang out, eat some pot-luck and have fun watching a couple of these wonderfully ""bad"" movies.  Remember: a snob is someone who can't enjoy anything.",1343692800,3,1585,4.581560283687943
2627350,5,B000H5U68O,"Nightmare Worlds contains 50 old-time and mostly forgotten Sci-Fi/Horror type movies that have a 'charm' of their own. The picture and sound quality isn't that good but this adds to the creepiness in my opinion. Unlike with some of the older sets, this one comes with a hard plastic container.

 My favorites for this collection include Counterblast(1948), The Lost City(1936), and The Severed Arm(1973). The Lost City has TV surveillance systems and portable walkie-talkies(in 1936!). For those who enjoy these old drive-in style flicks, Nightmare Worlds should offer hours and hours of viewing entertainment.",1288137600,,610,5.4787234042553195
2627351,4,B000H5U68O,"Okay, I ordered this for $17.49 on sale down from $30, and I found out there are movies in it not listed here on the advertisement, a different selection for just a few, disc 10 has four movies, one ""The Severed Arm"", and that was an interesting movie if it were not for no ending, it stops after the beach scene where the crazed one arm man kills the scoped rifle holding police officer, the other guy and the one arm mans' daughter seem to be heading to the mountain cabin of her brother and it has a ""glitch"" or ends right there and goes to the menu.  The other three movies on the disc, two flash gordon and a 1984 sci fi movie all have endings, so maybe that is all the severed arm had, or there is a defect in the disc, seems the disc looks of low quality than most of the others, there is no ""silver"" on the outside edge ring, but one other similar has all movies working movies.  The case was slightly broken inside holding all the films, and one other film disc that apparently works is scuffed real bad where the paper sleeve ""wore"" on it, amazing it reads, on my blue ray player I am upconverting for higher resolution(somehow I suppose).
I almost hate to return this for a refund, I mean, what if I get a different selection, somehow, I did enjoy a Christopher Lee/Peter Cushing ""Horror Express"", about a brain sucking entity in a frozen ape creature, a movie I hadn't seen in ages, it seems alot of these they never play on t.v anymore, probably never will again I suppose.  The resolution on Horror Express seemed okay, except a few dark scenes, but considering the source material was likely low resolution copies or degraded film, I was surprised it came out as good as the last time I saw it on television, probably twenty years ago on cable.
$17.49 was alot for the problems I have with the minor case crack inside(not outside) that doesn't affect anything really, and the scuffed up disc, and the movie severed arm without an ending, I wished it had been $12.49 like one of the other sets I bought, but I may or may not ""exchange"" for a better copy.  IF SOMEONE COMMENTS THAT THE SEVERED ARM movie doesn't have an ending either in their ""Nightmare Worlds"" collection, then I can surmize that is all they had to work with.  Very enjoyable movie collection though, wished they hadn't included any Flash Gordon shorts, cause I recently locally bought a used complete collection of Flash Gordon and from the fifties as well for about $8 bucks, I have em all already, but there are folks who likely never even saw those flash gordons, I did way back in the 70's once a week like a regular serial on a Saturday night creature features show run by a guy named ""Bob Barker"", I think I remember that rightly(probably a west coast figure). Talk about an innocent time in the 70's, as a kid, I yearn for the simple days when I would watch Portland(OR) wrestling from 11p.m. to 12:30 am, then creature features till I suppose about 3 a.m. in the morning, I think sometimes they'd put on two movies, or they'd do a show with interviews with famous figures, like ""Chuck Norris"", he was being interviewed several times talking about marshal arts, showing moves and such, it must have been a satellited in cable show from California up here to the Oregon coast.
$$###UPDATE-----$$$$
I emailed mill creek about the suspected bad disc, and about two other discs that had strange scratches from the sleeve, and they replaced all three discs so fast I thought I had received the wrong mail from another vendor, and they included a nice gesture sampling of some of their latest products for free, a very professional company indeed.  AS for the ending of the movie to ""The Severed Arm"", the replacement disc has the same ending so that is all the movie they had to work with or that was the ending originally, but I was glad my other two discs get replaced with new ones for free, it was likely a production glitch that got the two discs scratched up, I mean, its their latest product, and companies like to hear when there is a production problem occuring.  Thanks Mill Creek, I'm still buying your products regularly, of course.",1283299200,4,4128,4.4813829787234045

This collection is listed as unrated. Of course, many of the early features pre-date the movie rating system. However, there are a significant number of rated movies - some PG, but leaning heavily toward R.

On a cheerful note, you can just reconcile yourself to thinking, ""So - even if only a few movies are watchable, it's worth the price."" But it's not worth messing with returns & hoping you'll really receive 50 watchable movies.",1230422400,10,701,4.768595041322314

2627387,4,B000H5U68O,"After I was almost finished watching the 50 Horror Classics mega pack (put out by Treeline) I proceeded to acquire more 50 movie packs from Amazon.com: Nightmare Worlds, Tales of Terror, Sci-Fi Classics and Chilling Classics.  What is great about these mega packs is that if you watch one movie per week on average, one of these packs will last almost a year for you.

Although the quality of the movies in Nightmare Worlds collection is not as good as Horror Classics, there are a few gems and interesting curios that you might find to be an enriching viewing experience.

I've watched about 80% of the movies in the package and it is quite a diverse collection which ranges from the 1920s all the way to the 90s.  A few standouts are Alien Contamination (cheesy Italian sci-fi horror), The Alpha Incident (atmospheric and creepy), Beast of the Yellow Night (very unusual and unique film), Werewolf Woman (Italian erotic horror of which Quentin Tarantino is a fan), The Nightmare Never Ends (ever wanted to see Satan at a disco?), End of the World (w/Christopher Lee), Idaho Transfer (pretty good dystopia sci-fi), House of the Living Dead (Victorian-era horror set in South Africa), This is not a Test (pretty cool Corman-esque suspense about atomic war from 1962), Night Fright (a G-rated 1960s teen horror flick), Piranha Piranha (interesting jungle adventure that that just oozes the 1970s) and Prisoners of the Lost Universe (great cheesy 1980s sword and sorcery action).  Of course, there are other good movies as well that I didn't mention and I've yet to watch and I failed to mention the ones that I really didn't like, which there were a few.

But there is more to like than to dislike here.  And besides, the point of this collection is to put in as many ""public domain"" movies as possible, together.  The picture quality is not always the best, but many of these were transferred from old VHS copies--probably the only source which Treeline was able to find.  And for the low price, even if there are only a handful of movies that you like, then it is a worthwhile investment.

There was a movie out last year called ""Grindhouse"" where there are 2 main features (directed by Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez) which was an homage to cheesy 1970s low-budget films.  If you liked this, then I would suspect that a lot of the movies in this package will be of interest to you.",1216771200,5,2383,4.731884057971015
2627388,1,B000H5U68O,"All these are public domain movies with low production values.  It's basically the same stuff that was shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000 but without the comments.  I happen to like a cheesy movie now and again and am quite able to yell out my own quips with my friends.  However, the DVD's are bad.  By bad I mean that they blur out in digital green squares.  Others in the set were watched once then not able to be watched again.  The DVD player tried to index to the menu for a minute and ejected it.  They remind me of the old Goodtimes videos of the 80's that had tracking lines no matter where you set the dial.  These could be a fun bit of cheesy movie value but it's lost by the poor quality DVD's that wear out quickly and become unreadable.",1210809600,4,753,4.216783216783217

But, some of these are visually defunct - some are just so fuzzy and dark you have to wonder what condition the original was in.  There's a couple of really fun movies in this pack but there's a large portion of really dreadful late 60's/early 70's abominations in which the script writing, filming, acting, and directing had to have been done through a dense haze of some mind altering drugs.  Ugh - just horrible and difficult to watch more than 10-15 minutes of.  But then again, they are so horribly bad that, well, they're funny, quirky, and often bizarre to the point of being interesting.  One of them however was a real unexpected gem however... Robot Pilots.  This was a lot of fun - and had us laughing quite often.  The Rocky Jones clips are always welcome.  There's some good Gamera flicks here...  Oh, and the StarMan flicks are a hoot.  All in all...  you get a handful of winners and quite a load of dogs (in which I have to believe the producers walked away before the movie was even half finished).  Is this worth it?

Annoyingly, the compilers have done--so far as I can tell--absolutely no clean up on either the visuals or the sound.  As a result, some of the films are scratched, dirty, and difficult to understand.

One complaint. Why do these comapnies insist on having their watermarks pop up ever 10-15 minutes for 20 seconds throughout the film? It's most annoying. And I buy DVDs to get away from that sort of thing. (And it's put me off buying any more from ""Mill Creek""). And seriously apart from advertising it's pointless. My local community station shows films all the time where this happens. I'm assuming they just buy the boxed set and broadcast without clearance.

Only other disappointment with this set. One of the disc sleeves had the BBC documentary from the 1960's ""War Games"" listed. I got most excited. The film on the disc is ""Flight 412"". Sad.

2627412,2,B000H5U68O,"I purchased this set for 2 films:

1. Maciste In Hell - The packaging & advertising for this set states that it includes the full 95 minute version of Maciste. It actually has the 65 minute version. The picture quality is also worse then collector's copies in circulation. Tremendous film, though. I'd love to find a print of the 95 minute version.

2. Mistress Of Atlantis - Unlike Maciste, this print is a moderate upgrade from the collector's prints in circulation, & is about 3 minutes longer. One of the very few Brigitte Helm films available to English speaking viewers. If you don't already own this film, & are a Helm fan, the box is probably worth the price, & heck you're getting 49 other films with poor video quality for free.

I recently had the chance to compare this print of Mistress Of Atlantis with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alpha-stand-alone-edition/dp/B0025X4PH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alpha stand alone edition</a>. This version is slightly superior.

While both were obviously sourced from copies of the same (likely 16 mm) somewhat deteriorated print, the version on the Nightmare Worlds box appears to be a couple generations closer to the actual print & also has better audio, so I would recommend buying the Nightmare box instead of the Alpha. To be clear the picture quality isn't great on the Nightmare edition either, but it's better then the Alpha, & it does have 49 additional films for just a few dollars more.",1176249600,10,1499,5.20746887966805

I haven't watched all 50 of them yet, but the ""acting"" and laughable special effects in the first three have provided plenty of ""WTF?"" moments.  My only complaint, even though it's somewhat unrealistic, is that the sound quality is quite poor at times, leaving the dialogue rather garbled.  I keep it in perspective, however, considering that the films are old, and in many cases, largely unpopular in their own time, leaving them very unlikely to be truly remastered in any way.  However, if you like old sci-fi films, these flaws actually add to the charm of the movies, reminding you of a time when a little imagination, and even some forgiveness as an audience, was required.",1389312000,,976,4.826347305389222
