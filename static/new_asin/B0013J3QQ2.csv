3111493,4,B0013J3QQ2,"Decided to take a risk on this one and found ourselves a decent flick. It's funny, a good story, and has some adventure.",1375142400,4,120,4.260869565217392
3111494,4,B0013J3QQ2,"A funny comedy of ""board people"", their dreams of Australia and reality surrounding as three of a group walk through a desert towards unknown.",1220745600,4,142,4.958333333333333
3111505,3,B0013J3QQ2,"Only middling for non-linear presentations of all the scattered groups brought together purely by vagaries of fate. Not interesting enough for me, and humor was so underplayed as to pull in nothing laughable.  Doubt this one should be in the COMEDY category.  Disappointed. KVR",1425168000,,277,5.2727272727272725
3111506,4,B0013J3QQ2,"way worth the watch. the few lines of the description do not do this justice.  this was way more than a road trip, and well worth the time.",1424908800,,139,3.9642857142857144
3111507,4,B0013J3QQ2,"When I have little anticipation for a good film and happen upon a gem like this, it is a rare treat, and much appreciated.  The characters are engaging and realistic, and the humor flows naturally from the situations they find themselves in.  I very much enjoyed this film.",1423267200,,273,4.666666666666667

3111509,5,B0013J3QQ2,"What an odd movie! Totally enjoyed it. A struggle for survival told in an amusing and even lite manner. No preaching. No serious reality checking, but a most engaging movie.",1421280000,,173,4.8
3111510,4,B0013J3QQ2,"Excellent story, adequate acting, in very scenic W Australia. Mildly funny each step of the way, in the context of a serious look at immigrants from several perspectives.",1418688000,,170,5.107142857142857
3111511,4,B0013J3QQ2,"I loved the movie and my wife periodically broke out in peals of laughter.  It was well done and well acted. The only part I did not understand is -- if I was in a desert on foot with very little water and practically no food, I would have no energy in a day.  Yet these guys keep bouncing around with energy.",1416009600,,309,3.967741935483871

3111513,5,B0013J3QQ2,What an entertaining movie about the human spirit and the will to succeed.  Set in the beautiful Australian desert.,1404691200,,115,5.052631578947368
3111514,5,B0013J3QQ2,"I was thinking oh well what the heck when i chose this movie, i was glad that i did. a group of 12 illegal aliens are dumped on the Australia coast, from which they try to make their way to Perth on foot. It is a quirky thought provocing movie, and who doesn't love Australia. Pretty funny, very enjoyable.",1404000000,,306,4.203389830508475
3111525,5,B0013J3QQ2,This was such unexpected enjoyment. Maybe you have to be old enough to understand the boat people .  But boat people from Persia ! That was a surprise. We must remember there was a Persia and there are still Persians.,1403568000,,217,4.425
3111526,4,B0013J3QQ2,"Good flick, different than the usual ""formula"" movies that are so common.  Starts off slow, but we hung in there and ended up really enjoying the movie.",1402963200,3,152,4.62962962962963
3111527,1,B0013J3QQ2,I do not like sub title movies to start with and it was a terrible movie.. My husband would not sit through it,1401148800,2,110,3.8260869565217392
3111528,4,B0013J3QQ2,Pay close attention to the beginning.  I am glad I watched at home and could return to this scene.  Great story of people thrown together in the worst circumstances but draw strength together and leave behind their differences.  This movie can be enjoyed on many different levels.,1400198400,,280,4.914893617021277
3111529,5,B0013J3QQ2,"if it were not a true story this would be the most imaginative film you ever saw. It is also immensely funny, more than a little goofy and just plain interesting. The plot is way too wild and woolly to recount. Just watch it, you'll want everyone you know to see it.",1395964800,4,266,4.134615384615385
3111530,4,B0013J3QQ2,"Although the movie depicts several different characters illegally landed on Australian soil and is supposedly based on true stories, many stretched the imagination but all were sympathetic and funny. Stuck in the Outback with no food and miles from any settlement, an Arab immigrant is trying to get a broken down truck to be roadworthy, he struggles to remove and replace a flat tire only to find the replacement does not fit the hub. He throws a fit, throwing the wheeling, kicking the truck. I found it funny because it exactly what i would have done.",1394323200,,554,4.78125
3111531,2,B0013J3QQ2,"Somewhat entertaining, but that's the only thing I remember about it.  We almost shut it about 3 different times.  Maybe we are missing something, but it was just an excuse to sit with my feet up and eat pumpkin seeds.",1392940800,,218,4.425
3111532,4,B0013J3QQ2,"The humorous and sympathetic depiction of this band of off-the-books immigrants to Australia does not neglect the poignancy of there individual struggles.  They are willing to risk everything to start a new life, each for his own reasons. Part of the humor comes from the degree to which most of them are ill-prepared for the journey and perhaps deluded by their imagined role in the new society to which they aspire. The isolated Australian coastal desert on which they are dumped instantly assaults their expectations of a large civilized Western democratic center (here played by a Perth that we never actually see). The survival instinct and ingenuity of the three men, one each from Iraq, Cambodia and Thailand, is inspiring. The actors were very adept and believable, with good comedic performances that still preserved the plausible seriousness of each characters circumstances. For those of us who hop into our cars or on a train each morning and quickly arrive at an air-conditioned and well equipped office, the existential risk encountered by each of these three would likely defeat us.  It is interesting to compare the inactivity of the locals to the frantic scramble for survival of the immigrants.  The film seems to be solidly of the opinion that Australia will be the better for allowing these guys to join in.  The three members of the military squad sent to find the lost and confused immigrants were themselves examples of a successfully blended multi-cultural group. Their is not an unhappy ending, but we can't really predict what the father of the Cambodian young man will do when he realizes who is at his door. I came away hopeful.",1391731200,3,1656,4.9675090252707585
3111533,4,B0013J3QQ2,"Another entertaining and thought provoking film out of Australia.  A group of boat people land on Australia's shores with all their hopes.  They all face adversity in their own way as they move toward their hopes and dreams in a strange new land.  They are gently pursued by the authorities and all encounter serious obstacles and humorous situations.  Each character is well developed and well played.  If you are looking for high speed chases and special effects, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for more gentle adventure, I highly recommend this film.",1389830400,3,558,5.010869565217392
3111534,5,B0013J3QQ2,"Hadn't heard of this but enjoyed it immensely - funny at the right moments and politically astute. Good film for those interested in Australia, immigration politics, or buddy comedies.",1388188800,8,184,5.379310344827586
