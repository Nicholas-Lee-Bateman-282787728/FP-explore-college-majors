8416043,5,B00449MIZ8,I love Chris Jones and Susan Strasberg and to see them together in a movie was awesome. They were in love and married at the time the movie was made. So the movie displaying the couple as being in love in the movie was actually true to life. I saw the movie at the theater when it was first released. I was filled with emotion watching them on the big screen back then. Every time I watch this movie over and over again I still feel the same way. It is a beautiful love story and Chris is fantastic portraying a rebelliouis teenager. He looked older than a teenager but it doesn't really matter. I will always love that movie. I have a copy of the DVD along with his other movies.,1388361600,,680,4.159090909090909
8416044,4,B00449MIZ8,"I know Chris and waited a long time for this to be on DVD as I had never seen it before. His co-star was Susan Strasberg, whom he married. A beautiful actress whose father headed the Actor's Studio in New York, Lee Strasberg. A movie for his fans, who like all of the movies he made. He was called a new James Dean. Suzie died about 9 years ago at an early age.",1357862400,,361,3.958904109589041
8416045,5,B00449MIZ8,"I first watched Chubasco over 20 years ago and I loved it then.  It's such a sweet love story and the couple actually didn't sleep together until they were married---how's that for shocking.  I also liked the cast.  Christopher Jones and Richard Egan are both so handsome and Susan Strasberg is so pretty.  I'm so glad the movie is finally on DVD so that I can watch it again, and again, and again.",1291161600,6,398,4.410958904109589
