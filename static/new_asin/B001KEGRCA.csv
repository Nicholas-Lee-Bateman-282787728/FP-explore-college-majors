3664692,5,B001KEGRCA,"I also originally saw this film in IMAX 3D in Seattle as a parent chaperone with my son's second grade class. You know something is truly magical and amazing when it not only has all the adults in the room on the edge of their seats with mouths half agape, but a bunch of 7- and 8-year-olds in exactly the same position. Not only that, but the film's  powerful message, perfectly chosen and choreographed soundtrack, and absolutely breathtaking cinematography were not lost on anyone - the kids wanted to go to the Grand Canyon and save the river afterwards. My son still talks about it nearly a year and a half later.  If I could give this film more than five stars, I would.  Neither you (nor your children)will be disappointed in this amazing show.",1242172800,2,751,4.548148148148148
3664693,5,B001KEGRCA,"I originally saw this movie in an IMAX Theater and was blown away by the entire production.  The views, the sound, and the narrative are truly fantastic.  This is still true for the BRD version.  I watch this disc almost daily and I can't get enough of it.  If you like the BBC Planet Earth discs, you'll surely love the Grand Canyon Adventure.  The Dave Matthews Band soundtrack rocks too!",1238112000,5,390,4.514285714285714
3664694,5,B001KEGRCA,We bought the movie because our daughter and childhood friends were river guides for OARS.  It's also a great way to run the Colorado River when your waiting for your next trip.  Disappointed in the color quality of the video.  It's faded and doesn't match up to the quality of the video at the IMAX theatre.  It would also be nice if they would have included the 3d glasses.,1237507200,2,375,4.391304347826087
3664695,3,B001KEGRCA,"I have several IMAX dvds and had high expectations about this new Blu-ray product. I especially liked the Ganges and Mysteries of the Nile productions and expected even better footage here since they were filming the Colorado River and landscape of the Grand Canyon.

I think as a conservation film this was okay. However, if you are interested in landscapes and river rafting, I've seen so much better out there and I was disappointed in the quality and coverage. I have a new Blu-ray player and expected better from this film. I guess it loses something once out of the IMAX, 3D environment it was designed for. It almost seemed over-exposed. Too much time focusing on clever graphics. After all, this is the Grand Canyon - it is not needed and I found it slightly irritating.",1235779200,15,778,4.720588235294118
3664696,4,B001KEGRCA,"I didn't see any description for this disk when writing this so here is a quick summary: The Colorado river is dwindling due to our ever expanding need for fresh water. Conservationist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and botanist Wade Davis (along with their daughters) and canyon guide Shana Watahomigie take an expedition to illustrate the need for changing the way the Colorado is exploited.

I haven't seen that many IMAX films on the Grand Canyon so I won't be able to give any real comparisons, but I will say this one does at least deliver on what I was looking for: Nice wide footage of the Grand Canyon. Although most of the footage is personal shots of the expedition you do get some really good aerial footage as well as other impressive nature shots.

The difference between this particular documentary and what I would normally expect from a Grand Canyon is that it has a conservation message tied to it. Instead of focusing solely on nature's wonder there is a lot of footage on the effects of drought and siphoning of the Colorado River. So if you are looking for a full-on nature safari this isn't exactly it. At the same time it's not like you aren't getting any absolutely amazing footage either. Just not as much as I was expecting.

Like many IMAX films coming to Blu-Ray the AVC transfer is breathtaking. Every little detail will stand out. The audio is equally immersive with the DTS HD MA 5.1 track getting you wrapped up in the sounds of the canyon all over. There is also a French DTS audio track. On the minus side there are no subtitles of any kind. There are a somewhat respectable list of extra features on this release, which I suppose it better than expected. Most of the extras are standard definition with the exception of one. Here is what you get:

- 30 Minute Making of Featurette

- Music video by Wade Davis' daughter, Tara

- Retrospective of MFF IMAX productions (in HD)

- Water saving tips and river clean up tips (sponsored by Kholer and Tava)

- Fact sheet on the Grand Canyon and Colorado River

- Trivia quiz (text)

Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk is a very worthwhile documentary that shows the real beauty of the Grand Canyon... if you don't mind the preachy parts. Of course conservationists will really appreciate the fact filled message as well as the eye candy. The IMAX theater release was also in 3-D, but I haven't heard of any releases on Blu-Ray or DVD that will take advantage of that anytime soon.",1235347200,37,2453,4.579908675799087
3664697,5,B001KEGRCA,This was one of the best movies that I have ever seen. The effects were amazing without things flying at you. My husband and I had been debating a cruise or Grand Canyon after seeing this movie and getting chills from it we have decided to take the trip out west I would recommend this movie to everyone.,1231459200,,304,4.258620689655173
3664698,5,B001KEGRCA,"I saw the IMAX movie in Seattle last summer, and since then I have been telling everybody about it!
I just pre-ordered 2 copies of the dvd, one for me and another for a fellow river rat friend of mine.
The message is poignant.
But it's the feeling of ""being there"" that carries the day.
If you can not go raft the Colorado, this is a close second best.
The visuals of dropping water levels speaks volumes about the need for water conservation.
It is informative without being preachy. A rare equilibrium!
5 stars are very well earned!",1231113600,,534,4.459183673469388
3664699,5,B001KEGRCA,"We saw this movie at the IMAX in Chicago Science Museum yesterday.  It was an excellent mix of documentary account of a family's journey by raft down the canyon, sweeping views from many different angles of many sections of the canyon, and white-knuckle rafter's eye views through rapids.

The soundtrack really fitted the movie well, especially in the IMAX with the mega screen and loud surround sound.  It's all by the Dave Matthews Band (as soon as I get home and on my own PC I'm going to buy the mp3 download from Amazon).

This movie really shows you clearly what impact mankind has had on the Colorado River in terms of the total amount of water flowing through it, the flora and fauna along it, the lifestyle of the people who traditionally depended on it, etc.  It also provides some very practical ideas for how we can all contribute to water conservation.

Overall, that's a big thumbs up from the four of us :)",1230681600,,922,4.557575757575758

3664721,5,B001KEGRCA,"I absolutely and  thoroughly enjoyed every single moment of this stunning 3D film. Every chance I get to watch a 'nature film' like this one in 3D I find it a real treat to be able to do so. And when the 3D is dome right it makes it even a more enjoyable experience. Please3 keep in mind that if you intend n watching this in 3D that not all 3D TV's are made the same and some 3D TV's just do not do a good job at rendering a 3D image no matter what you're watching. Luckily I have a very nice 65"" TV that does an excellent job at rendering a perfect 3D image. This allows me to experience parts of the world as though I were actually there. I really enjoyed the water shots, at times I felt as though I was actually going to get wet as the 3D was done perfect for some of those shots! The scenery in this film is absolutely breathtaking and so beautiful.

  I will sum it up with this/ If you are at all on the fence about buying this title, just do it and take a trip to the grand canyon right in your own living room! especially if you have a good 3D TV!",1489190400,3,1057,3.8796296296296298

3664794,5,B001KEGRCA,"A living, breathing, pop-up book!

You know, I am reminded of the early days of HD television.  Most of you will probably
relate.  There was no content in HD other than one or two channels that did nothing but
show nature videos.  So, there you were totally enthralled by gorgeous HD footage of
insects mating -- and you watched it because it was just amazing to look at in high definition.

That's sort of how I feel about these IMAX titles.  I am not the kind of person that
would regularly go out and buy these documentaries.  However, I have quickly learned
that these IMAX releases from Warner and Image are becoming flagship demo material
for the new format.  They are expertly produced and provide some of the most awe-inspiring
footage you will find anywhere.

Narrated by Robert Redford, Grand Canyon Adventure River At Risk basically takes us
on a journey down the Colorado river through the Grand Canyon, its inner gorge and surging rapids.
Along the way we are given a brief history of the earliest settlers, the Anastasi Indians as
well as the earliest pioneers who trekked down into the canyon.

Along the way we are treated to various wildlife and reptiles that inhabit the region
including gila monsters and rattlesnakes.

The one problem that viewers may have with the content is that is does tend to
become overly preachy.  In fact, to different extents, this seems to be the case
with all the IMAX titles I have seen thus far.  However, in its defense, this is one
of the main reasons why you get actors like Robert Redford and environmental
advocates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Wade Davis behind projects like this.  The
purpose of these videos are to entertain and educate.  In this case, the message
of the Colorado river being altered and depleted by water consumption and man-made
dams is a very important one.  Yes, this message is driven to the viewer moreso
than similar documentaries but I suppose I was too enthralled with the video to complain.

So, let me talk about the 3D image quality.  At the top of this review I mentioned
a pop-up book.  That is probably the best way to describe what the 3-dimensional
experience is like.  You have this unbelievable sense of depth from mountain peaks
to canyon floor.  They look almost like cut-outs strategically placed to create a
breathtaking illusion.  Within that you have small people who look like cut-outs
themselves that can be easily picked up between your thumb and forefinger.  With
all this added depth, you are looking at the canyon in ways that you never could
before and certainly unmatched by anything filmed in 2D.

Other than the menu and title sequence that features a floating water bubble
that moves in and out of screen, there is hardly any ""In Yo' Face"" gimmickry to
be found.  That's fine.  It's not needed here.  I did like the effect enough, however,
to give a slightly higher category rating.  There are still ever-so-slight problems
with objects moving in from the front that shift your focus and momentarily
interrupt the 3D experience.  I am finding this common with the material.

What I also find to be remarkable is the image quality.  I don't believe I have ever
seen high definition television look this spectacular.  The images are so amazingly
crisp and defined with gorgeous colors of the golden desert, canyons and rocky peaks
set against a saturated blue sky.  It's just breathtaking.  There are no flaws here.

The audio is very punchy.  Do turn this up loud.  There is an excellent soundtrack
that encompasses all the channels and features the music of the Dave
Matthews Band.  The sound of rushing or splashing water effectively surrounds
the viewer.  Once again, a soundtrack as immersive as the imagery.

Included is a 34 minute 2D ""making of"" documentary that interviews cast
and crew and gives you an idea of what it is like taking 300 lb. fully loaded
Imax cameras down into the canyon to film this kind of action.

CONCLUSION

Another spectacular IMAX entry, Grand Canyon Adventure River At Risk,
is a title highly worthy of your consideration.  Fortunately, this is a reasonably
priced title for its 45 minute running time.  I found it on Amazon for $20.

I think most people will easily overcome the preachiness in favor of the
stunning 3D imagery this program provides.",1453075200,,4293,4.773097826086956

Andrew's 3D Blu-ray Review: IMAX 3D: Grand Canyon Adventure: River At Risk' combines exhilarating river-rafting action on America's most iconic river with and the grandeur of the Grand Canyon to tell an engaging story of how ordinary people can make a difference for our parched planet, one that is running out of clean, fresh water. Taking audiences on this illuminating rafting trip are two environmental heroes: world-renowned river advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and author, anthropologist and explorer Wade Davis, accompanied by their daughters Kick Kennedy and Tara Davis. They are guided by Shana Watahomigie, a member of the Havasupai tribe and the first Native American to become a National Park Ranger and river guide.

IMAX 3D, when used appropriately, can be as dynamic a visual experience as one can hope to witness. In IMAX 3D: Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk, this is proven from the moment go. Rushing down the rapids of the Colorado River, the film's credit sequence appears on drops of water that spray towards you. The Dave Matthews Band, a well-chosen source for the movie's soundtrack, keeps the mood upbeat, and, like the kayaks and rafts that we follow through the movie's journey, propelling forward. This IMAX film is a gorgeous stunning film and you can be assured, it looks totally spectacular, but the films topic is quite grave, especially on the impending environmental issue as well. The truth is that the Colorado River, like so many rivers around the world, is experiencing a drought that literally threatens its total existence, unless the world wakes up.

The film follows anthropologist Wade Davis and his daughter, Tara Davis, as they photograph and follow the river through the Grand Canyon. Also along for the trip are Robert Kennedy, Jr., son of the senator and a long-time environmental activist, and his daughter Kathleen Kennedy. Early in the film, Robert Kennedy, Jr. reflects on how meaningful it is to share this particular adventure with his daughter, who is just preparing to leave for college. Footage of his father taking him to the Grand Canyon when he was roughly the same age makes this moment more resonant.

The crew has as its river guide Shana Watahomigie, the first Native American to become a National Park Service river guide and ranger in the Grand Canyon, and whose ancestors have lived along the Colorado River for centuries. Her knowledge of the river at every turn is impressive. At the beginning of the film, Shana must leave her daughter, too young to make the trip, behind. However, showing these cross-generational relationships in the context of this adventure delivers a clear message: we owe it to our children to insure their access to our natural resources. Clearly, so much is in the balance. A stirring score, featuring songs and music from the Grammy Award winning Dave Matthews Band, sets the mood for this adventure that explores the issues, presents real solutions, and delivers an uplifting message of hope for future generations.

The film is just one in a series of 10 IMAX films regarding our planet's water like `The Living Sea' and `Dolphins' are two others, and produced by the MacGillivray Freeman Films, a production company committed to its environmentalist message as well as to excellence in IMAX film making. In addition to the film's beautiful cinematography, its adroit editing, and the aforementioned soundtrack, Robert Redford's exceptional narration is also worth mentioning. In addition to the expertise of both Wade Davis and Robert Kennedy Jr., Robert Redford, like Al Gore, gives the film a an authenticity that can only come from someone with his level of commitment to environmentalism.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  IMAX 3D: Grand Canyon Adventure: River At Risk' on this Blu-ray Disc certainly benefits from having gone through the process of being scanned at 8k before any blow-ups or processing was done for this awesome aspect ratio 1.78:1 high definition transfer. The results here are truly breath-taking, with an extremely high level of perceived resolution at Blu-ray's standard 2k depth. The pixels seem denser, the source looks immaculately clean, sharp and detailed, and the colour reproduction is so vibrant it is almost like looking through a window. This presentation is evidence that the best 70mm film handled well rivals or even exceeds the best high definition recording techniques available today in terms of resolution. What really gets you in the mood before the film starts is the impressive Grand Canyon Adventure' Titles before you start the film.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  With its awesome 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track IMAX 3D: Grand Canyon Adventure: River At Risk' is very engaging for an IMAX feature from the MacGillivray Freeman Films. The surround mix is filled with the thunderous sounds of rushing rapids throughout the soundstage and the lively music of the Dave Matthews Band mixed discretely into the five main channels is used effectively to give weight to the sound effects when necessary, and dialogue is clear and cleanly balanced in the centre channel. What is also very impressive is the female narrator at the start of the film gives you a fantastic surround audio adventure with all your speakers being used.

3D Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature Documentary: The Making of Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk [2008] [480i] [4:3] [33:40] This is an in-depth look at the behind-the-scenes look at the making of this awesome IMAX 3D film. But of course it explains the thinking behind this spectacular film, and we get contributions from people like Greg MacGillivray [Director/Producer]; Stephen Judson [Editor/Co-writer]; Wade Davis [Author/Anthropologist]; Tara Davis [Wade's Daughter]; Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [Environmentalist Activist]; Brad Ohlund [Director of Photography]; Rob Walker [Assistant Cameraman]; Mark Krenzien [Producer]; Stefan Lessard [Bassist, Dave Mathews Band]; Steve Wood [Composer]; Alan Markowitz [Visual Effects Producer]. What comes out of this brilliant documentary, is the reason why they decided to make this IMAX 3D film and it is to promote the environmental impact that humans are causing on a grand scale in depleting the Colorado River, especially the ever growing population of Las Vegas and surrounding area, where people do not realise what dangers are before them by 2020, as there could be an environmental disastrous bombshell. So to highlight the problems, Greg MacGillivray though that the IMAX 3D would be the ideal film format to show people what humans are causing so many problems and to hopefully save the Colorado River. You also get to hear about the awesome logistics in filming in the IMAX 3D format, especially how big and heavy the cameras are and how they were able to film the trip down the dangerous rapids. We also hear why Greg MacGillivray decided to use the Dave Mathews Band that features the songs and music throughout the film. So all in all this is a totally brilliant documentary and must watch. The only shame that they could not of been able to film it is the 1080p encoded image and also the 1.78:1 aspect ratio.

Special Feature: A Message From TEVA [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] 5:56] The TEVA company is proud to support this conservation environmental film and a company to raising awareness and stewardship of our world's natural places and have included this series ""The Naturist,"" for your amusement and they warn you not to try this where you live. What you get to see is this guy wandering around a woodland area, who is not given any credit, shows you what not to do when it comes to enjoying the nature environment, like taking some honey from a bees hive, but gets badly stung profusely, so to counteract this he shows you how to eat poison ivy and how to apply it to your face to counteract the stings, but you get to see his face becomes a right old mess, so tells you not to try this. But you also get 2 other short films, on how to survive with nature, but as you will see this guy gets into more serious troubles, so again the message becomes very clear, do not copy what you view on how to survive the same sort of environment.

Special Feature: Water Saving Tips from KOHLER! [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:50] This is more like an info advert, and is introduced by David Kohler, who is the Executive Vice President informs us the best ways on saving water and that the Company has been in business for 135 years.

Special Feature: Tara's Music Video: Water [2008] [480i] [4:3] [4:06] Tara Davis appears in the film with her father, but we are informed that she is wonderful vocalist/songwriter [you must be joking] Tara along with her band ""The Engine Room"" create the song title ""Water"" for the IMAX 3D: Grand Canyon Adventure' 3D Blu-ray. Sadly Tara Davis is so out of tune and flat as a pancake and I cannot understand how they allowed her into the recording studio, but the only bonus is that you clips from the IMAX 3D film and also some behind-the-scenes you don't get to see elsewhere and on top of all that, the sound is totally atrocious. Definite thumbs down verdict for me and should have been left out of the extras.

Special Feature: Sample The Film Soundtrack: Once Greg MacGillivray began shooting IMAX 3D: Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk' he knew that the film would need some special and evocative music, music that could stand up to the excitement of the white-water action and convey the vital importance of the worldwide water crisis. When the Dave Mathews Band, with their indelible melodies, propulsive rhythms and moving lyrics, agreed to use some of their hits for the film, the film producers were thrilled. The Dave Mathews Band bassist Stefan Lessard and composer Steve Wood recruited Carter Beauford and Boyd Tinsley, as well as frequent collaborator Tim Reynolds, long time Dave Mathews Band friend Richard hardy, who plays the Native American flute, legendary steel guitar player Greg Leisz and guitarist Michael Hamilton. Stefan Lessard and Steve Wood play bass and keyboards, guitar and harmonica respectively. Steve Wood, who has worked on many IMAX Theatre musical scores for film director Greg MacGillivray, and Stefan Lessard arranged and recorded variations of six Dave Mathews Band songs and together created new compositions for the film. The CD soundtrack is also available for purchase at selected IMAX Theatres and online at www.amazon.com and they have included two audio tracks only for your listening pleasure, which are entitled ""Grand Canyon Railway"" and ""Lava Falls.""

Finally, IMAX 3D: Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk' is a breathtakingly-filmed IMAX 3D presentation that abounds with gorgeous photography of some of the Earth's most precious natural resources. Though the message sometimes overwhelms the imagery, and especially reinforces the film's profound message and seems to make it all the more timely, particularly considering that the 3D imagery and especially the latest high definition technology only further enhances our natural wonders of the area and deliver the next-best sensation to actually being there. This 3D Blu-ray release of `Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk' looks totally fantastic and is also an equally awesome sensation with the raft ride down the Colorado River and definitely this Blu-ray release deserves to be included in everyone's 3D Blu-ray collection. IMAX 3D: Grand Canyon: River at Risk' is one of several IMAX 3D titles now making its way to 3D Blu-ray releases from the folks at IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT, and it is also one of the best. And it is also ""the most pressing environmental story of our time"" as the Blu-ray Cover informs us, especially maintaining our planet's fresh water supply is an important issue and it's one we should all be more mindful of. And with this disc's impressive 3D visuals, I find myself for the first time eager to see where the 3D Blu-ray discs might go from here. Highly Recommended!

It gets very annoying to be trying to enjoy the beauty of this treasure while listening to a narrative of gloom and doom. At the time this movie was made, the activists threatened melting of the global ice caps. Yet, since this movie was made the ice caps have expanded dramatically. The Grand Canyon itself was literally carved out by massive water flows. It has dwindled through the ages and will continue. The Earth will eventually be consumed by our own ""red giant"" . Politics has no place in this 3D movie yet Hollywood continues to try controlling the political climate, no pun intended. If you turn off the movie's sound track, I give it 3.5 Stars.

Dave Matthews groaning in the background,  the banjo playing down the river, the earnest environmentalist with (of course) his equally as earnest college age daughter in tow, the somber commentary of Robert Redford,  the female Indian guide talking about (wait.... yes, leave for her kids, etc.), and mid way thru, the cherry on the sundae, Bobby Kennedy Jr.

Again, scenery great, too bad we can't have an alternative narration, somewhere along the lines of the HBO documentary narrators.

I get it that they are trying to be earnest, hip, and modern, but the DMB even sounds dated today, just a few years after the film was made. It'll be even more hilarious in 20 years. There's very little of Robert Redford's narration--most of it is supplied by Wade Davis (of Serpent & the Rainbow fame--you know, the zombie researcher from Harvard). Muting the audio would help immensely, as the video half is watchable (be prepared for a few still pics of RFK in his heyday). The white water rafting scenes were enjoyable in 3D, & there really is no way you could get as good a view of the Canyon in person. Plus, with this DVD, you can visit the Grand Canyon while sitting on your couch enjoying air conditioning and cold beverages. For under $15.",1362528000,4,888,4.487654320987654

Especially some first person pov on a raft which get hits with water. Really impressive in 3D. They also do some nice overlays of older photos of the canyon which they slowly reveal the current day reality of the same location. Kind of like a slow dissolve of the older photo. The director also provide some great shots from a helicopter which are amazing. Truly a great disc. My only grip, and it is small, the graphics in the opening sequence is a bit cheesy. Also when they do a PIP with people in interviews the digital frame they put around people is distracting. Otherwise definitely worth the money.",1359590400,2,754,4.510948905109489

However, I was really annoyed and tired quickly of the narrated script that droned on and on about water shortages and other conservationist activism. It's a shame that demos of 3D DVDs must kowtow to this type of propaganda.

Update: Although IMAX documentaries present strikingly realistic demos of the 3D video format, their commentary drones on and on pushing the conservationist political agenda; it's way, way overdone.

This particular documentary is in my top 5, which warrants the 5 star rating.  It is a tad bit ""preachy"" about water over-use and conservation, but you expect that from a documentary.

I am determined to do the same river trip as documented in this movie.  After seeing this movie, I added it to my ""bucket"" list.

This movie is mellow and relaxing, contemplative, visually stunning, and joy to watch again and again.  I wish they spent more time on the actual river rafting, but the ancillary excursions on their trip were fascinating in and of them self.

Though I am not a big fan of Dave Mathews, his music was an excellent choice for this movie, and really ties it all together.

The ""must-haves"" (my opinion only) IMAX documentaries are:

o this movie
o IMAX Under the sea, narrated by Jim Carey
o IMAX Deep Sea or IMAX Ocean Wonderland (lol, I can't remember which one was better)
o IMAX Born to be wild (I've seen grown men cry on this one)
o IMAX Earth 3D

To be skipped

o Cave of forgotten dreams (so boring, I couldn't even finish it)

There's more footage of the people whining about the river than there is of the canyon.  Even then the speech is hard to distinguish over the background sound while the 3D effect is good in places it is mostly quite ordinary.

The other reviews on Amazon gave it high marks for its 3D effects and that sold me. Less than 5 minutes into the video, I realize it's a product of the environmental movement that seems to think we should put everything back the way it was 50 years ago. One example early on is a statement that environmental activists are debating the pros and cons of tearing down the Glen Canyon dam so that the silt that is prevented from traveling further down the Colorado River can be reintroduced. I noted on the cover as soon as I opened it that it was narrated by Robert Redford and on the back cover it reveals that Robert Kennedy, also a known environmental activist, was one of the principle characters. One or both of them make references to global warming as though it's accepted fact when we know that's not the case...even scientists can't agree it's happening.

The narration is a wet towel on the whole film.  It is nothing more than an expression of a very left wing political view. There are definitely issues with the canyon that should be explored but there are statements made that make you want to scream as they totally defy logic or ignore the obvious.  For example, yes it would be nice to have the river flow in its natural state, but the fact is there are very large cities in the southwest that use the river and the filmmakers choose to ignore that fact.  A straightforward, balanced documentary would have been preferable.

Having visited the canyon last year, I would have enjoyed a more balanced approach. The reason for purchasing an IMAX blu-ray is to enjoy the spectacular views, not to listen to a self-rightous point of view.  This disc is diminished by the narration.",1325289600,2,1099,4.571428571428571

Well for me, I didn't like Dave Matthews (until I saw this), liked Robert Redford n a couple of movies, and liked listening to RFK on Air America. The real reason you want to see this movie is to see the Grand Canyon in 3-D. This movie does an EXCELLENT job of that. The depth is simply jaw dropping.
A lot of people who hated this movie called it preachy, and made it seem like this was for latte drinking liberals. Well, guess what folks, potable water is a limited resource, and if you can't come to this conclusion, you have been following the rhetoric of global warming is a scam funded by the Koch Brothers. The truth is we do have some protected land that some private industry can't buy up and exploit. THANKFULLY! Wow, I'm getting off topic, I guess that makes me care about our environment, and some may even call me a tree-hugger.
Anyway, take a trip in a canoe with RFK's family and appreciate the beautiful effects of 3-D.

Most of the picture is set back too deeply that it strains the eyes to watch. Some scenes, primarily in the beginning, have bubbles that move about the screen, but as they get closer they separate into a split image that hurts the eyes allot to watch. We cannot even watch the intro because of this. The movie is great except for the depth level being too much.

I try not to base my review on anything but 3D and how it looks but the I had a hard time simply taking in all the beauty because of the heavy conversationalist/ water conservation overtones through out the film. While I support the ideas expressed in the film I would have liked to have taken the beautiful raft river ride down the Colorado River free of interruption.
Very sharp and beautiful detail was apparent throughout the movie, and it gives you a sense of just how much depth the Grand Canyon has. Spectacular birds eye footage that when watching it in 2D lacks some of that luster that I saw in the 3d version. The 2d was still very pretty but which would you rather view, a screen of high definition images, or the birds eye as it sores through the canyon. I envy the birds.

The 3d was good, the movie it self was alright, but I hoped to see more breathtaking images of the Grand Canyon and I did not get that. Robert Redford it seemed only narrated a tiny part of the movie. That was pretty disappointing, it was like they said Morgan Freeman was narrating a film, but than 90% of it was narrated by Andy Dick. I realize that has nothing to do with the 3d, but when I bought the film I was under a different expectation. Ultimately the film was pretty, but political overtones and 3 different narrators hindered my overall experience. Also if you are looking for another awesome Imax 3d movie check out Tahiti big wave.

I'd like to address those one star reviews.  With the exception of the guy who didn't realized special equipment was needed to view the film in 3D, they all come from the political right.  Mention conservation or ecology to them and they immediately foam at the mouth.  They've bought the gospel of Exxon-Mobile, Chevron, et al, hook line and sinker.

This film focuses on a photographer and his daughter along w/ a few friends, Bobby Kennedy, Jr, etc., going on a rafting ride through the canyon with the only female Indian guide (at the time of filming). Part of the canyon is her native land, thus discussion ensues about the serious issues of poor water management depleting this vital river, invasive plants on the small areas of previously used farmland, and general stewardship concerns. Some of the photography is absolutely stunning. When in 3D mode, the film appears as if you are looking through a window. At times it seemed I could extend my hand and touch the clear, still water. I enjoyed this film as I did not go on a white water rafting ride when I visited the North and South rims during 2002.

Not counting a few shallow effects, there are 11 out of screen effects. 4 that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and another 3 around 25%. Bubbles float around extending up to 50% for 90 seconds. Grinding sparks shoot out for 15 seconds up to 50%. A fishing net hangs out 35% for 15 seconds and there is a floating window at about 20%. The effects in the menu are also very nice.

No real complaints about the in screen 3D. Most of the footage is clear and excess parallax only showed itself a few times.

*** Nice scenery and wild river shots ***
*** The bubbles floating around in mid air are pretty cool ***

MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

The aerial scenes of the Grand Canyon are gorgeous. So far so good. The problems become apparent when the ground crew and voice-over start their turn. The storyline is clichd and gets in the way of the greater story - the Colorado River. A father taking once last trip down the Colorado river with his daughter is irrelevant. Perhaps a bit more history of the explorers and their tales of discovery would have added more to the movie. Again and again the viewer is inundated with a message that dams are bad for the local ecology, especially the ones on the Colorado River.

The camera crew tries hard to get some cool shots of the river while they make their way down on raft. Unfortunately, the cameras seem to too big and unwieldy for such an adventure. The footage is short and forced. Once on land the actors seem like props and don't help the movie at all.

Although most of the footage is personal shots of the expedition you do get some really good aerial footage as well as other impressive nature shots.

The difference between this particular documentary and what I would normally expect from a Grand Canyon is that it has a conservation message tied to it. Instead of focusing solely on nature's wonder there is a lot of footage on the effects of drought and siphoning of the Colorado River. So if you are looking for a full-on nature safari this isn't exactly it. At the same time it's not like you aren't getting any absolutely amazing footage either. Just not as much as I was expecting.

Like many IMAX films coming to Blu-Ray the AVC transfer is breathtaking. The 3-D on this release is indeed in full 1080p as opposed to the 720p some studios are mulling over for their 3-D BD releases. Every little detail will stand out, even on the included 2-D version (even if those details won't come out and touch you). The audio is equally immersive with the DTS HD MA 5.1 track getting you wrapped up in the sounds of the canyon all over. There is also a German DTS HD audio track. Unfortunately like the original Blu-Ray release I think there are no subtitles of any kind. There are a somewhat respectable list of extra features on this release, which I suppose is better than expected. Most of the extras are standard definition with the exception of one. Here is what you get:

- 30 Minute Making of Featurette chronicling the challenges of shooting in IMAX 3-D.

- Music video by Wade Davis' daughter, Tara singing ""Water""

- IMAX feature trailers in HD

It looks like they took out some of the features that are on the 2-D only Blu-Ray released a little while back like the HD MFF IMAX Productions retrospective, conservation tips, fact sheet and trivia. I guess you can say it's small price to pay for the 3-D aspect. Still some will miss the retrospective.

Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk is a very worthwhile documentary that shows the real beauty of the Grand Canyon... if you don't mind the preachy parts. Of course conservationists will really appreciate the fact filled message as well as the eye candy. The IMAX theater release was also in 3-D so now you get the full experience of this 40 minute feature... well... aside from the massive IMAX viewing screen of course.",1286928000,105,2552,4.558951965065503
3665228,4,B001KEGRCA,"Beautiful photography, worth the price, but watch out for the ""greenie"" messages, especially toward the end.
Actually too short for such a great subject.
Would be weary of buying from this director in the future because of the environmental messages in the naration.",1286668800,,266,5.209302325581396
3665229,1,B001KEGRCA,"If you expect to see a film on the grandeur of the Canyon, this will be a grand disappointment.  Instead expect little snippets of the canyon interspersed between the ""made for silent films"" voice of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. preaching on how bad all the rest of us are.  Except for the quality of hi-def, this film is more exemplary of a mediocre family film, i.e. Kennedy.",1267142400,13,371,4.522388059701493

Another, short subject documentary, winner by MacGillivray Freeman

White water rafting in the Colorado River accompanied by the music of the Dave Matthews Band (DTS HD Master Audio 5.1).

Lots of breathtaking aerials of the Grand Canyon. Beautiful shots inside the canyon. A definite home theater reference Blu-ray disc.",1264896000,,357,5.69811320754717
3665239,5,B001KEGRCA,"This is Imax at its finest with the highest possible video quality available as there's a vast difference to me when a film is shot in HD compared to a standard definition DVD that has been upgraded/transferred to the Blu-ray format as this type of film really shows what Blu-ray is all about which is far above regular definition videos.  If you love Western scenery like I do and love to see it in the highest quality, then this is for you with the conservation message being a plus.",1264464000,2,485,4.449438202247191

3665241,2,B001KEGRCA,"I presumed the video, ""Grand Canyon Adventure"", to be an adventure-based, scenic video tour of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River. Having never been there, I had hoped to ""tour"" the Canyon vicariously via this BD offering.

Sadly, it was nothing of the sort, being instead an environmentalist's message about dwindling water levels of the river itself. This was the theme of the entire video... a message about choices of water usage.

While there were several very nice shots of parts of the canyon, they were presented with a message, which detracted from the desired 'adventure' theme. I guess I should have been a more critical reader of the reviews before purchasing the video.

In conclusion, if you are interested in viewing/learning of opinions about the current ""health"" of the river, i.e. water levels and flow, then this video may be just right for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a nicely done tour of the canyon or of the river, as I was, then you'll want to look elsewhere.",1256688000,23,1007,4.742857142857143
3665242,3,B001KEGRCA,It wasn't what I expected. The rafting footage wasn't long and the whole movie was short in general. A few good shots but that's about all. Not worth my money,1255564800,3,158,4.3
3665243,4,B001KEGRCA,"as Imax lover this is a good movie but was found to have a mark on the face of it over the lines, and have to be returned  I will no doubt look again and maybe go for Blu ray in this type . Imax are very good but bit costly at times , If you want a good Grand Canyon  movie  then go for the Hidden Secrets that is a very good one of the canyon with nice music score  I find Imax very good  regards the ordinery dvd with this type of movie short but well worth having. would be nice to get a Imax dvd of New York City from high up with air views from the plane and fit a nice music score in it  that goes with the city Like the naked city. I hope one day it will  be done",1253232000,,670,3.547945205479452
3665244,5,B001KEGRCA,Got this disc primarily to inspect video quality and it did not disappoint.  The visuals are incredible on this bluray disc and the soundtrack is perfect.  The story does get preachy at times but the visuals kept me glued for the duration.  Highly recommended.,1251763200,,260,4.863636363636363
3665245,2,B001KEGRCA,If you can get by the commentary the scenery is nice. But don't expect a lot of shots of the canyon mainly focuses on the river.,1251590400,7,128,3.9615384615384617
3665246,4,B001KEGRCA,Fabulous scenery captured with great cinematography and sound track.  This doco contained a serious conservation message which was delivered in a very entertaining fashion.  We're an outdoor adventure family and were greatly entertained by the fast paced action on the rapids.,1251244800,,276,5.7073170731707314
3665247,5,B001KEGRCA,"River at Risk narrated by Robert Redford is a ""heads up"" warning about a subject matter almost all of us take for granted...WATER.

3665248,5,B001KEGRCA,Imax films are THE state of the art in picture and sound quality in Blu-ray discs and this disc continues that tradition!! The color is spectacular and natural and is sharp as a tack unlike many blu-ray movies where you have many scenes that look like they were shot slightly out of focus or in 720P!! (An example of this is the Planet Earth discs)I will use this as a demo disc to show off my new home theater!!,1243555200,2,412,4.227848101265823

8314767,3,B001KEGRCA,"I understand the desire to deal with problems along the Colorado River and to get the word out on the importance of this.  Unfortunately, what could have been a celebration of the Grand Canyon, turns into a real downer.  The 3D photography is amazing, but to enjoy it, you have to endure a relentless lecture from the narrators.  This video is definitely worth owning if you have 3D technology in your home, but you should be braced for the constant lament over mismanagement of the River.",1500854400,,489,4.662790697674419

The 3D is actually good , pop out 3D as well ...
It stands for a GREAT cause and it isn't called The Grand Canyon ... It even say's Adventure and River at risk ....

The Soundtrack ... Oh my god ... If you have a decent surround sound ... You won't be able to wipe the smile off your face!!!! My word !!!!!",1497312000,2,344,3.7777777777777777
