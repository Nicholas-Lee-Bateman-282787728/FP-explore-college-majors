2393153,5,B000ATQYX8,"All you foot-tappers and jump-the-gunners should look before you leap.  If you go to the Universal TV DVD home page, you will see that The Munsters Complete 2nd Season on DVD is being released in BLACK AND WHITE, not colorized.  Amazon has it wrong for some strange reason.  No colorized version will be released, unlike the first two seasons of Bewitched.  Only the packaging will be in color, NOT THE SHOWS.  So calm down, Herman!  Enjoy classic TV the way it was supposed to be seen, or the Fregosi curse will befall you---hehehehehe.",1127779200,8,537,4.720430107526882
2393154,4,B000ATQYX8,What the hell is taking so long for The Addams Family to hit dvd shelves? RISE UP IN ANGER!! DEMAND THE ADDAMS FAMILY ON DVD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!,1127260800,12,139,4.384615384615385
2393155,5,B000ATQYX8,"The Munsters COLORIZED! You should be ashamed to say it. The black and white works perfectly for the classic spoof on the Universal monsters and should ALWAYS be as they were filmed.

IN BLACK AND WHITE! 2 sitcoms I loved the most as a kid growing up in the sixties were the Beverly Hillbillies and the Munsters.

I saw the change from B/W TV to color. I can live with watching a B/W TV show. I don't need a digital junkie messing with it for color. I can't wait for this second season to arrive. I've watched the 1st season several times on long weekends in order. I LOVE IT! Witty humor, Great slapstick, and very warm hearted. They don't make TV shows like this anymore. Too bad too. Too much vile junk on TV anymore. Thanks to all who bring DVDs like this to the buying public. The world was a better place once upon a time and it had GREAT TV shows like this.",1126224000,14,864,4.198795180722891
2393156,5,B000ATQYX8,"I bought the first season DVD set, but this is the one I've really been waiting for. It has my two favorite episodes: the one with ""Fair Deal Dan"" starring Frank Gorshin as a crooked used car dealer, and the other featuring the battle between Herman and a new employee at the parlor--Clyde, the practical joker.

When TV Land aired the Munsters, they refused to show this episode. I always wondered why; now I read on here that they considered it ""too violent"".

How absurd. When TV Land started, it sounded like a great idea--a cable network dedicated to presenting old, classic TV series, maybe the way TCM presents old movies. This turned out to be a false promise. TV Land, typically, turned out to be a pure rubbish, run, now we learn, by a bunch of PC fascists who not only cut up episodes in order to fit in more commercials, but also censor which episodes we get to see depending on which offend their ""enlightened"" new age fascist sensibilities. Now the network is completely worthless, airing nought but awful 1970's & 80's sit-coms wall to wall. And to think the original reason I switched to satellite from cable was that I wanted TV Land and my cable company refused to carry it! Now it is just another of the 200 or so cable/satellite networks I get but never watch.

Thank god for DVD, and re-issues of old time TV series, uncut, unedited and in sequence. We need no longer be subject to the whims and censorships of the weepy, sensitive PC types that run networks like TV Land.

I'm looking forward to the release of this set. Hopefully soon Leave It To Beaver, Get Smart and other still unavailable series will get DVD'd, and we can spit on the network heads (and think of what ""head"" means on a ship and you have an idea what I think of TV Land and its program censors) and be our own program planners, without the supervision of the paternalistic and condescending experts who would decide what is fit for us to watch.",1125705600,154,1937,4.494318181818182
2393157,5,B000ATQYX8,"Episode #53 ""Herman's Peace Offensive"" as a child in the 1960's was always my favorite, and needless to say it aired over and over. The problem is the public relations people at ""TV Land"" & ""Nick at Night"" told me that ""we will never air it"" In my opinion the scene (which I think is the one that ""TV Land"" & ""Nick At Night"" has a problem with happens at Herman's work locker) is really not all that bad. I'm not going to spoil it and tell what happens due to the fact that Munster fans old and new may never have seen this episode and with only 70 total episodes ever made it's a great treat to find out that an episode that they may never have seen will be included in this DVD set. This episode is one of the best that is filled with pranks galore, but more importantly a great lesson is learned which Herman teaches to Eddie. The viewers who have not yet seen this episode can decide if this episode should be banned. Beside this episode, some of the best were made so the entire second season should be greatly welcomed!!Wayne Lalevee",1125100800,36,1039,4.252525252525253

2393275,5,B000ATQYX8,"Fred Gwynne is a true comic artist.  His portrayal of Herman Munster, one of the tallest characters on television, allowed him a chance to do everything from have tantrums to SERIOUS belly laugh.  This man can act.  And, as has been noted before, by me others, here's a man whose costume seriously jeopardized his health yet he still continued.

Season 2 of The Munsters adds another slew of knee slapping comedy for your family.  This is television the way it was supposed to be: funny, infantile, goofy and, as their competition Addams Family might say, ""Altogther ooky"".  Herman, Lily, Grampa, Eddie, Cousin Marilyn and play the Munster family to our benefit.  Get this, watching it with your kids and laugh.",1467590400,,711,4.875

2393359,5,B000ATQYX8,"What adolescent boy of the sixties didn't love Universal Monsters? So when this series first premiered I was in seventh heaven. Now that I finally got around to the DVDs I thought it might be fun to read the paperback The Munsters: A Trip Down Mockingbird Lane (by Stephen Cox) as well. It has disappointed. Its a pretty comprehensive behindthescenes into the real people involved in the show and though it gets into some dirt, it doesnt come off as a tabloid piece.

As to my review, much of it is going to seem repetitious. The entertainment industry loves nothing more than to repackage & resell merchandise. So to me personally, I wish Amazon had some way of addressing this. Unlike the coffinstyle packaging of the first DVD releases this 6disc set comes in a standard (clear) keepcase with two inner pages. The enclosed insert offers the following product information;

2393362,3,B000ATQYX8,"Note that this review is for the later issues of Season Two (one-sided discs). I waited to purchase this series until Universal issued them on one-sided discs, as I had already encountered numerous problems with other shows and movies for which Universal used the dreaded two-sided DVD-18s which invariably froze and skipped, making them basically worthless.

""The Munsters"" doesn't need to be rated for the show itself. By now everyone knows what the series is about. My review is based on the quality of these one-sided DVD's. While I haven't encountered any playback issues to date, I find Universal did a terrible job of preserving the rich black & white picture for which this series is known. Many episodes on these disc have a distracting shimmering of purple and green patches, much like what one sees if they are watching a B&W presentation and ""crank up"" the color on their set ""full blast"". The thing is, these transfers act that way WITHOUT ""cranking up"" the color. I find this very disappointing, because the B&W of ""The Munsters"" always added to the enjoyment of the show.

One last thing: Universal, in their effort to remind us who manufactures the most faulty DVD's in the business, has decided to force us to watch their modern logo and music prior to EVERY episode. Really Universal? You don't think we're going to remember your name?",1455494400,2,1353,4.852813852813853

2393383,4,B000ATQYX8,"Wanted to write this review so that everyone can avoid the confusion that I had. When I received this set of DVDs of Season Two of The Munsters I got a six-disc set that includes 32 episodes, the documentary ""First Family of Fright!"", three documentaries on the main actors, and a single DVD of the two movies ""Munsters, Go Home"" and ""Munsters Revenge."" That sixth DVD of the two movies is also available as a separate purchase. And, it is even listed in the ""Frequently Bought Together"" section of the page for the Season Two DVD. Since the amazon page does not say that the Season Two package includes these movies, I thought I should buy that extra DVD to complete my collection of The Munsters material.
Lucky for me, amazon gave me a quick refund, so no big deal. I know it's probably hard for them to keep track of this kind of stuff, but we can help by educating each other, right?",1448323200,10,888,4.420731707317073

2393628,4,B000ATQYX8,"After finishing the first season of The Munsters I decided to continue and finish the series with this season two box set. Lets begin with the packaging, it was a nice idea to have Herman's head as the outer package, but it is a little flimsy and can be very tight to pull the outer sleeve off. I found that if you just take your time it will come off with no problems and I just left the outer box off until I was done watching the entire season. I then replaced the outer box and it will probably sit on my shelf for a year or so until I fell a need to see these shows again. This season set has double sided discs like the first season, but as I pointed out in my review for that set, it really isn't a problem unless you have defective discs. Once again some general care will ensure years of play. Although I did have a problem with episode # 67 A House Divided freezing up, but after watching the remaining three episodes, I went back and tried # 67 again and it seemed to fix itself as it played perfectly twice through.

On this set I thought the episodes looked a little grainer over all than the first season. I would also like to address a complaint that buyers are expressing in their reviews, in the first 7 episodes the opening does not have the sound effect of Herman crashing through the door because it was not used until episode eight, so it is nice that the set includes both openings. This is not a defect.

My biggest gripe is that there are no chapter breaks! This is extremely irritating as when you are watching multiple episodes you have to fast forward through the opening or hear the great theme song for every episode. To make matters worse they have attached a Universal Logo to the opening of every episode making the intro even longer! There is also a very small edit in episode # 55 'Just Another Pretty Face' when Lily and female Herman are exchanging lady talk at the breakfast table. It's not very long, but will irritate fans who know the series by heart.

On the plus side this set has a fair amount of bonus material which was sorely missed on the first season set. The bonus features include a 45 minute documentary 'The Munsters First Family Of Fright' and three 45 minute biographies one for each of the main characters Fred Gwynn, Al Lewis and Yvonne De Carlo. Great new is that episode # 53 'Herman's Peace Offense' which was banned from several TV stations because of a dangerous practical joke used in the episode is included! in its entirety. It happens to be my favorite episode and it's nice to see it here unedited.

If you don't own the series you may want to buy the complete series set which includes both Munsters feature films a colorized episode and all extras from carried over from the season sets, but be warned that they did not fix any of these problems, but they did use single sided discs on that set. It would have been nice if they had put chapter breaks in season two and fixed the edits, but then they wouldn't be able to give us a new and improved version a couple of years from now! ;-b",1270684800,,3054,4.306086956521739
2393639,5,B000ATQYX8,great fun on dvd.  kids and I love it.  watch it over and over.,1261958400,,63,3.4285714285714284
2393640,5,B000ATQYX8,"While the world was very turbulent in the 1960's with the Vietnam War and race relations in America a very serious issue, the three networks decided the best way to attract an audience was to have them escape into fantasy land with shows that were innocent. Among those shows were ""Bewitched"", The Addams Family"", and this little classic ""The Munsters"" about a family of innocent monsters trying to fit into everyday society. This boxset features all 32 second year shows uncut and are beautifully restored to pristine condition. This would be the last season of ""The Munsters"" on CBS as ABC programmed the cult ""Batman"" series against it. ""Batman"" was produced in beautiful color while CBS continued making ""The Munsters"" in black and white. The show looked pale to the beautiful color prints of Batman and Robin and viewers left ""The Munsters"" in droves. By this season, 1965-1966, many network shows were being produced in color and it wouldn't be until the fall of 1966 that most of CBS' primetime lineup aired in color. I always thought that if Universal (the studio that produced ""The Munsters"") had made the series in color it would have lasted more than just two years. Still, ""The Munsters"" have lived on in syndication and on cable channels like TV Land for over 40 years and now thanks to DVD we can enjoy the entire series in posterity. One episode that never aired on TV Land called ""Herman's Peace Offensive"" is included here. Why the cable channel refused to air this particular show is a mystery. Also, unlike the season 1 boxset there are a slew of bonus features including a great documentary called ""America's First Family of Freight"" that examines the show and its influence on American culture. The packaging is very inferior as well to that of season 1 as the 3 discs are housed in a cardboard sleeve that in turn is held into a slim box of covered plastic. This slim box makes it very difficult to pull the cardboard out from so I suggest that if your going to watch this set leave the cardboard out until your finished watching as you don't want to damage the cardboard. An excellent series with loveable characters ""The Munsters"" will always live on in our hearts. There are also two ""Munsters"" movies now available on DVD together in one set. These films were made after the show was cancelled by CBS and are called ""Munster Go Home"" and ""Munsters Revenge"". Also, the complete series is available in one complete series set along with the two films. Enjoy!",1251763200,2,2482,4.721198156682028

2393642,5,B000ATQYX8,"PAR EXCELLENCE!

Although there is a little to be desired in comparison to ""The Munsters, Season One,"" the same can be said here of ""Season Two."" But still, the two volumes offer this meteoric series in its entirety, and looking at the whole body of work, it's hard to believe this series only ran for two seasons! Usually, when a pilot episode is offered, the network gives it up to 13 episodes to see if it catches on. Then, if they feel good about it, it gets 13 more episodes, for a total of six months of air time. There is an off-season where reruns are shown, as the writers brainstorm another season, which is twenty-six more weekly half-hour shows. From the Fall of 1964 to the Spring of 1966, ""The Munsters"" ran for a total of 70 shows! Putting it in context, I think this is astonishing.

But it quickly ran its course, and the show gave way to ""Batman"" in 1966, leaving the air with its dignity intact. When a popular show overstays its welcome, that is fatal, to the show, and the actors. A good example is Fox's ""Married...With Children."" From 1987 to 1990, this was one of the funniest shows on TV, but changes in the writing, premise, and cast, made a once genuinely good program into a parody of itself, and over the next seven years, it degenerated into a shambles. And the ghost of Al Bundy has haunted Ed O'Neil ever since. A good, talented actor now has extreme difficulty  being taken seriously, because he is forever stigmatized with shoe salesman Al Bundy. This same problem affected the careers of Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis from ""The Munsters."" The only reason Yvonne DeCarlo wasn't permanently saddled with her Lily Munster role, was she was already an established actress with a long successful career before being cast as Lily.

What I don't particularly like about the second season (not really ""don't like,"" but am slightly averse to), are some small differences but differences nonetheless. The opening sequence, once dark and sinister, with a light touch of whimsy, is now, in-your-face slapstick; Herman crashing through the front door as the theme music, now transposed to a higher key and played as fast surf music, though genuinely funny, betrays the original idea. He is now far more impulsive and child-like, and even though he is now more comical, he is more frenetic, and his voice sounds somewhat pinched. This isn't bad I guess, but it is a reversal of the first season. But, the change is gradual, and maybe it's just the evolution of the character, but seeing the two facets in a back-to-back context, it becomes apparent he was written to evolve this way, to garner a few more laughs.

And not as pronounced, there is a similar change in Lily; once very cool and collected despite the occaisional snit, she's now the overprotective worry-wart henpecker of a wife and mother who needs to cut the apron strings. Don't get me wrong, the show is consistently funny and well-written throughout, but the changes were too pronounced for me. Too picky? Maybe, but these are just honest criticisms.

Still, I have always seen ""The Munsters"" as a very funny, well-made show; an excellent parody of the 1950's TV shows mixed with the classic horror films of the 1930's and 1940's, an odd combination that surprisingly works on every level.

Also in the ""Season Two"" set, there are four featurettes included, one on the story of the TV show, and one each of the careers of Fred Gwynne, Yvonne DeCarlo, and Al Lewis. This is very informative material for the hard-core fan of the show, and the casual fan alike. It tells of the hard life Gwynne had, including the death of his son, his divorce, the physical demands of wearing the ""Herman"" costume for 70 shows, two movies, and all the promotional appearances, and his trying to live down his role in history as Herman Munster, which was more a weight around his neck than an asset.

You have the life of Yvonne Decarlo, from being raised by an unstable mother, to her high and low points in the spotlight, physical problems later in life, and the drive to excel at all times. (On a personal note, I found her, up until, and especially during her time as ""Lily,"" jaw-droppingly beautiful.)

The life of Al Lewis is chronicled, from his youth as a persecuted minority, to a small-time actor, on to bigger roles, and his other pursuits, including the restaurant business, to a career in liberal politics and radio. But he rolled with his ""Grandpa"" image, and put it to good use.

Gwynne died in 1993, of pancreatic cancer, and the others, still living at the time of this release, have since died, and this cements the fact, that they were irreplacable. A new TV series and movie, with all-new actors  were attempted; ""attempted"" denoting the possibility of failure, and fail they did. This is something you don't mess with, a truism many Hollywood movie makers don't seem to comprehend. Leave the classics alone!

My short-term plans involve a ""Munsters"" marathon, and I recommend others do this.

2393644,5,B000ATQYX8,"Just got Season 2 in the mail today.
First thing is the outer plastic cover was broken apart at the folds already and the front was a bit distorted, almost like what would happen if you left plastic in the sun too long.
After pulling the cover off, however the inner disc holder is in fine shape, a bit out of shape at the corners because of the plastic shell being warped some, but nothing to toss a fit about.

The DVDs were perfect in appearance, not a single blemish.
However the 5th episode on side 2 of DVD 1 has some problems playing on both of my DVD players. So far its only the one show so I guess Im not too bent out of shape about it...could be worse and the price wasn't too bad so I guess its a trade off.
I will be looking into seeing I they offer a replacement disc and if I can purchase another outer sleeve, but overall Im very happy with both Seasons 1 and 2 and the money spent. No regrets.",1220486400,,910,4.027624309392265

After all this unaired material the producers could have lifted silly 1960s moral bans to make the fans happy. But no, that one was left out once again!

Episode 55, Just Another Pretty Face is a corrected episode: Herman gets zapped by lightening in Grandpas lab and turns normal without makeup, Lilly fails to find him attractive anymore.

This Episode has a censored predecessor, censored not to upset or enforce the gay community:
Herman gets zapped by lightening and turns into a goldilock Heidi type, exchanging nail polish comments with Lilly on the breakfast table.

Aired in Europe, I was able to see it!

I demand this episode to be included, after all we live in 21st century! Shame on the producers to dissappoint the fans so vastly!",1208476800,4,942,4.616766467065868

2393659,5,B000ATQYX8,"As our loveable and bumbling Herman would say, ""Oh boy oh boy oh boy!"" As many great reviewers have already said, this second, and final, season of the Munsters TV show is as wacky and wonderful as the first.

But rather than list the episodes that have been graciously written in other reviews, I would like to emphasize the Bonus Festures that are worth the price of this set alone!

There are 4 features, all about 1 hour in length, on the following topics: the Munsters effect on TV history, Fred Gwynne, Yvonne DeCarlo, and Al Lewis. These are absolutely fantastic! You get a in-depth insight into everything and everyone surrounding these marvelous Munsters and the Munster-mania that resulted.

Without giving away much of each feature, here are a couple of highlights from each:

""The Munsters"": Bored with the average family sitcoms of the 50's and with a resurgence of interest in the old monster movies of Frankenstein, Dracula, the Werewolf, etc, the very creative minds of Hollywood took a chance on combining the two notions into a ""Leave It To Beaver Meets the  Long-Lost Monster Relatives"" and for some strange reason, it was a hit. Who would have thought of making The Average American Family from Transylvannia? This feature goes into the detail of hiring each of the cast members. You get a short peek at the pilot episode that was very strange and uncomfortable because of the original Lilly and original Eddie that were cast; they were so not right for the part and you'll see how Yvonne and Butch were wisely chosen instead. The full 15 minute pilot is in the first season set as well. The popularity and craziness that followed the premiere of the show, as well as the loyalty that the cast  displayed in promoting the show was admirable. The only information that was missing was anything on Butch Patrick; yes, he was mentioned, and yes he was interviewed for the features, but very little information was given of the effects that this show had on his life.

""Fred Gwynne"": What a deep and complex man. Having come from a life of great privilege, but a hard working man nonetheless, there are parts of his life that I felt were so profoundly sad, that you realize that the energy and bravado that it took for the private Fred Gwynne to be the fun-loving Herman Munster was quite a strain for him both emotionally and physically. Yet he was a very spiritual and creative man and I feel those traits are what got him through the grief, frustration, and acceptance of much angst in his life. Not that he was without joy and happiness either, but you tend to feel that there was a very private side of him that very, very few were allowed to see. Also. the physical toll his character took on his body was incredible; you don't realize how much work it took to get him physically in character, and how his height and costume, was a challenge to his health.

""Yvonne DeCarlo"": Wow.......she was a real Hollywood hottie!! An absolutely stunning beauty, especially in her youth, she was quite the femme fatale of Hollywood. But as hard as she worked on her career and in her dedication to her husband and children, it seemed that she was never taken seriously enough as an actress. It took the role of Lilly Munster to garner her the fame of recognition, despite some very strong roles in other movies (aka ""The 10 Commandments"" anyone?).

""Al Lewis"": What a character! He was as wonderfully insane in real life as he was in reel life. A very dedicated father and husband, he lived a very nonconventional life of thought and action. Can you imagine ""Grandpa"" hanging out with The Black Panthers? Or running for office in his later years as a left-wing liberal? Hanging out with Howard Stern and dropping the F-bomb to the FCC? But he was such a honest and forthright person, that you come to really appreciate his candor as well as his loyalty to those whom he gave his friendship.

So when you purchase this set, enjoy the precious moments of The Munsters, but then sit back and really enjoy the behind-the-scenes look at how we came to know these characters and how they have been continually with us since the show aired somewhere in this world for the past 44+ years! It is a great travel down a very well-worn and welcomed road!",1204675200,4,4252,4.634794156706508
2393660,4,B000ATQYX8,"The complaints about the packaging: I like it myself. Yes, it is tricky not to mess up Herman's BOLTS when sliding the box back into the sleeve. The trick is, put in the top of the head first, then while sliding it in, squeeze together gently the bolts on each side, so they do not catch during the sliding in process. But since it's a tad of a problem, I give the DVD set 4 stars. (I would have given it 4.5 stars if there was an option.)
I haven't seen many episodes on DVDs yet, so I cannot say there are no problems yet. but so far, the episodes some people had problems with played fine on my DVD player. There is one little problem: it's hard to navigate to specific episodes. But I figured it out. Anyway, the picture is sharp and clear,and best of all, no commercial interruptions!!! If I have to get a snack or something, I just pause it. If you like the Munsters, get this!!! I love the Zombo episode. My favorite since I was a kid. Very touching.

2393663,1,B000ATQYX8,"First let me say that The Munsters are great! But I had to return this item twice, and Amazon has refused to send me an undamaged copy after those two were returned. Instead they forced me to take a refund for the item and didn't give me a choice about it, even though I applied for a replacement, not a refund! Both sets that I received had significantly damaged outer cases which made it hard to get the inner DVD sleeve out and back in once, much less many times. The first set was also scratched and covered in small torn paper debris. I had every valid reason to return them both times. Amazon says that because it is a widespread problem with these DVD's they can not ship another copy to me. I really  don't appreciate the way they handled this. That is how you go about losing customers. If the other reviewers here aren't going crazy over these cases then it must not be so widespread that they couldn't send me another copy. I'm really disappointed and upset, they can and should do a better job of making their customers happy and not force the customer to take a refund they don't want when they bought an item at a such a great price. Basically, it's just forcing me to buy it again at regular price. Not very good customer service Amazon! I'll take my dollars elsewhere  from now on or at least until they demonstrate that they care about their customers. I expected more in regards to customer service.

2393668,5,B000ATQYX8,"I find the Munsters show a great example of useful comedy. The writers made up many laughter punchlines of satire or misdirection that provide great examples for comedy. For instance, if someone says something nasty to you, you might respond, ""You are very kind, the kind I don't need."" I did not think the theme of the show about Dracula or Transylvania was the real comedy genius behind the show.

Moreover the show did present some psychological insights into the problems that children face. For instance, many children experience bullies in life, or children look up to their father as role model because they need to have a role model while growing up. This could have been developed more to provide more material for many more episodes than just 2 years. It appealed to young people and if the solution to many problems that children face were presented in each show, then the value of the show to communicate to parents and children how to deal with various problems was more valuable than just the concept of Dracula and Bats.

In this DVD series on disk 3 is included an endearing history of the actor Fred Gwynne, the actress Yvonne De Carlo and the actor Al Lewis. It showed their struggle to make a living in the actor field, and their struggle with life's problems in general.

As a whole I thought the 3 DVD set was worth purchasing to provide insight into a form of comedy that relaxes you as well as makes you laugh.",1179014400,,1433,4.58984375

2393686,5,B000ATQYX8,"The Munsters are a bizarre looking but genuinely honest family, just looking to fit in. They reside at 1313 Mockingbird lane and Herman works for the Gateman, Goodbury and Gravest funeral parlor. Never mind the fact that the he looks like Frankenstein or that his wife and his father in law are vampires. Their son Eddie is a werewolf, I guess thats what happens when Frankenstein marries a vampire. The only normal looking one in the family is Cousin Marilyn and shes referred to as the ugly duckling of the family, go figure.

The second season of ""The Munsters"" from Universal Studios has a really nice picture but the sound is definitely inconsistent on some of the episodes. Season Two has more in the way of DVD extra's than season 1 and I found them quite interesting to watch. Overall I give the episodes and the extra's five stars for the way Universal presented them.

The Herman's head packaging while unique in appearance is the worst idea ever and it gets two stars from me. The clear outer slip cover that slides over the head is so tight that the packaging has already come apart on my set and it has ruined the overall appearance of Herman's head. Darn! Darn! Darn!

Universal Studios should have kept the packaging the same as season one, nice and simple or better yet they should have released the series in one deluxe box set. Season Two of ""The Munsters"" is a must have for any fan of the show, despite the problems with Herman's head.

Bonus Features Include:

It's hard to take the discs out of the outer package and the same going In. This will break apart In my opinion sooner than later. I was ok with everything else and man I never get tired or sick of watching them all. Great show. 3 stars was strictly for the packaging but the rest to me goes off the 5 scale.

2393711,5,B000ATQYX8,"Five stars go to the episodes on these discs. Short of Universal cutting them to bits, it would be impossible for Season 2 to be anything less than the kooky, macabre joy that it's always been. Even the ""Kayro Vue"" logo has been preserved at the end of each episode, along with the ""Universal City"" logo, although in hindsight I'll bet they survived due to sheer laziness on the part of those responsible for getting these episodes to disc, rather than Universal actually respecting the material.

That lack of repect is why NO STARS, however, go to the handling of this release. I've learned not to expect good product from the current regime at Universal Home Video. Customers must endure spotty, inconsistent releases, zero investment in useful dvd extras(if there ARE extras even included), indifference to market demands (just how long did it take them to finally release ""the Munsters"" to home video, anyway?), and just TRY to get anything more than a noncommittal, terse response from their customer service department.

This time it seems it's all about the bad, really bad packaging. The extras, while individually well-made, are merely adequate as additions to this set, because they were all produced for other projects and simply brought together here, meaning nobody at Universal really went out of their way to make this final ""Munsters"" season anything special, like say, coralling the surviving cast or crew to offer audio commentary.

Comments and opinions expressed as supplementary material are a great incentive to buy and offer information and insight, but more importantly must be done for posterity, for when the stars pass away, they're gone for good.  There can never be a chance to get commentary from a dead person, not even formerly un-dead Munsters like Gwynne and Lewis.

Gone forever, then, are the chances for fans to hear favorite perfomers speak about their work as themselves, candid and out of character, and gone forever are Universal's opportunities to profit from it. And seeing as how it's all 'bout nuthin' but the profits for the boys at Universal, one would think they'd have struck when the iron was hot and profitable(or in this case, recorded commentary tracks some time ago while all of the cast was still with us), but, as the saying goes, ""stupid is as stupid does"".

Regarding the useless packaging, anyone who has made it this far into the reviews will likely be aware of the disastrous ""Munsters"" packaging which Universal has managed to foist off on an unsupecting public. It seems likely that it began life as a genuinely good idea before being degraded by poor material/manufacturing choices.

Buyers should examine each potential purchase of this set carefully before removing the shrink wrap for signs of splitting or breakage on the brittle plastic slipcover.  Such defects are a direct result of the slipcover being manufactured too small for the set inside, and clearly the consequence of the inner set being shoved in anyway during the course of manufacturing.  Once removed, it's not going back in without a fight, and a side by side exam of the empty slipcover and the inner cardboard dvd packaging reveals how much thicker/wider the inner set actually is than it's ""protective"" shell.

If ""Munsters"" fans are concerned about preserving all components of this purchase for future enjoyment, they may want to consider removing the discs altogether and storing them in a different sleeve, leaving the outer and inner packaging side by side as the non-functional pieces they really are.
Otherwise,this combination of flimsy cardboard die cuts and split-prone plastic seems likely to become ratty and dog-eared from even casual use.",1144454400,10,3691,5.065897858319604
2393712,2,B000ATQYX8,"UPDATE AUGUST 19, 2007: Even though I had already received two defective DVD sets, I decided this month to try for a third time and I bought this collection from my local Best Buy store; thinking if that the set was defective it would be easy enough to return.  To my great relief, this set is 100% perfect with all episodes playing with no problems.  I am glad I can now finally add season 2 of this classic TV show to my video library.

REVIEW UPDATE MARCH 9, 2006: I have received my second set of DVDs and I have the same problem!!  Disc 2 Side A - The Fregosi Emerald episode will not play!!  This is obviously a case of defective products coming right off the manufacturing line from Universal.  The odds of me receiving two bad sets with the same defect are very small.  Amazon should pull this product from their shelves and stop selling it to their customers until Universal recalls the discs and produces a set that works properly.  BUYER BEWARE.

Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Munster's fan and I would normally give this 5 stars based on the quality of the program alone.  However, I only give it two stars primarily because of the horrible job Universal has done in the quality and packaging of this product.  All of the other comments in the other reviews about bad discs and crappy packaging are true - I can vouch for that.  The packaging of this great TV show can only be described as cheap and unacceptable.  Universal presents the programs (like they did on Season 1) on two sided DVDs.  This time the discs are defective.  Disc 2 Side A of my set would skip and not play one of my all time favorite episodes, The Fregosi Emerald.  I cleaned the disc and tried it in multiple DVD players and it would not play.

This is a huge disappointment for us Munster's fans.  Universal should go and look at how Paramount packaged and presented the Andy Griffith Show on DVD and learn a lesson on how it should be done.  The Munsters Season 1 and 2 belong in my video library - they are one of the greatest TV shows ever in my opinion.  Just be aware that Universal has really botched things up on the quality and the packaging.  Don't be surprised if you get some bad discs in the set.

2393735,1,B000ATQYX8,"Let me start by saying I love this show and I would give it 5 stars, but this disc set is the worst I've purchased so far. I just purchased my 3rd set and again it is defective. I've purchased this from 3 different sources. My only guess is that many people here who have given this a high rating haven't seen every episode on every disc yet. The defects are always on different episodes. On my last set, 'Zombo' would not play at all, and 'Herman the Tire Kicker' freezes and stops half way through.

I've purchased many TV shows on DVD, and yes you do get a defective disc once in a while, but this is ridiculous!

I love the show, and I'm going to try to purchase a 4th set and maybe between both sets I'll be lucky enough to get all the episodes to play! Buyer beware!

PS- I've had no problem with Season 1 of this fine series, and yes I have several DVD players that all work.",1139356800,16,882,4.086705202312139
2393736,1,B000ATQYX8,"I've had two defective copies of this DVD set. I'm a big fan of the show, but I guess I'll have to live without this. I just can't see trying to get though another set of frozen or locked images. The packaging is also poor and doesn't protect the discs at all. A big dissapointment.",1137715200,15,282,4.1454545454545455
2393737,4,B000ATQYX8,"Man, how I have loved this show since childhood, and in particular waited for Season 2 because my two favorite episodes - ""The Fregosi Emerald"" and the one where Herman's musical career is brought to a screeching halt by ""Nothin' Muffins"" - are my favorites.

The biographies of star Fred Gwynne, Yvonne DeCarlo, and Al Lewis as the main ""extras"" are very cool, and I am fine with the quality - but am really disappointed over Universal's shoddy release of Season 2, compared with what they did for Season 1.

As others have said, the packaging sucks - it's cheap, flimsy, and hard to take apart and put back together; for that reason alone, I tend to watch the first season set more (it's just easier to get out of the case!).  But also, Universal has added this ANNOYING teaser advertising themselves AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH AND EVEY EPISODE.  This wasn't part of the original show, and if you watch a bunch of episodes in a row it becomes annoying and a distraction.

But what really hocked me off is that there are no chapters within the episodes!  With season one, you could jump to different scenes within a specific episode - not here!  If you hit chapter forward on the remote, you'll jump to the next episode!  SUCKS!

I am so glad to have the entire series now, but it's a real shame the TV's ""First Family of Fright"" was short-shifted with this weak season 2 release.  Universal, you guys were just LAZY with this one, cheating consumers (especially considering the price of the set), and I almost wish they'd release season 2 again ... this time with some TLC.",1137024000,15,1573,4.546099290780142
2393738,5,B000ATQYX8,"As a child growing up in the 70's and 80's, I used to come home from school and watch The Munsters. I was absolutely fascinated with this series. The characters were hilarious, and the scripts were excellent! Now, the complete second season, comes to DVD in a 3 disc set. It features all 32 episodes from The Munsters second and final season. Don't forget about the 4 A&E Bios as bonus features! The 4 A&E Bios will be about, The Munsters, ""America's First Family of Fright"", Fred Gwynne, ""More Than a Munster"", Yvonne DeCarlo, ""Gilded Lily"", and Al Lewis, ""Forever Grandpa"". All packaged, in a Herman Munster head.

Take a good close look at Fred Gwynne's portrayal of Herman Munster. You will see that Herman get's more and more child-like, especially in ""Prehistoric Munster"", and ""The Musician"". Herman has now developed a very large booming laugh, the occasional temper-tantrums, and his always popular catchphrases, ""Darn, Darn, Darn!!!"" and ""I'll kill 'em, I'll kill 'em, I'll kill 'em!!!""

Also, take a careful look at Al Lewis' sideburns. In the early episodes of Season 2, (""Herman's Child Psychology,"" ""Herman the Master Spy,"" & ""Bronco-Bustin' Munster"") His sideburns were small, but take a look at the episodes called ""Cyrano de Munster,"" ""A Visit from Johann"", and ""Eddie's Brother"", you will see that Al shaved much lower, and almost had some sort of a beard going on. A very neat trait for Grandpa to have!

Now, if you've only seen Season 2 episodes from TVLand, then you don't know what the original Season 2 theme is supposed to sound like. The original Season 2 theme of The Munsters is supposed to stop after Butch Patrick's name is shown. More theme music starts again when you see ""Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher"". That's the way it's supposed to be because when The Munsters originally aired on CBS, commercials used to be in that break between themes. TVLand edited the theme into one long version. The TVLand version, is incorrect. The DVD version, is correct.

Also, don't be shocked if some episodes do not feature the crashing door sound. That's the way it was originally supposed to be, because the producers (Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher) never intended for their to be a crash sound, but later added it to have more of an effect when you would see Herman come through the doors.

The box itself can also be a challenge to handle. What I have found to be handy, is just leave the inner ""head"" out of the original box.

The last three issues I would like to address, is space of episodes on the discs, B&W film turning sepia, and the audio quality of ""Cyrano de Munster.""

There are 32 half-hour episodes on this set, and four 40 minute biographies. If you have 3 double-sided discs, why not use the space appropriately? The episodes should have been spaced in this manner, seven episodes on Disc 1 A, and Disc 1 B, then 6 episodes on Disc 2 A, Disc 2 B, and Disc 3 A. Then place the four 40 minute biographies on Disc 3 B.

There is also a visible problem with some episodes turning sepia. Not all the episodes have their original rich B&W format. Some episodes have a yellow-brown tint that is visible by turning up the color on your television set. The only episode with real B&W, is ""The Musician.""

""Cyrano de Munster,"" probably has the worst audio quality of any ""Munsters"" episode. There is a light crackle sound that is continuous from about half-way through the episode, all the way to the start of the closing theme. It's annoying to hear ""snap, crackle, and pop"" for 10 minutes.

2393739,5,B000ATQYX8,"The Munsters was a hilarious tongue in cheek roller coaster ride of a show. It was simplistic genius, which is not easy to pull off.  This show was not only funny,it also had alot of heart. It was brilliantly cast but would not have been as funny without the stellar talent of Fred Gwynne, who breathed life and believability into the Herman Munster character....look closely..this man was a comedy genius! My favorite scenes are where Grandpa and Herman bicker or scheme,  only to have things predictably backfire.

There are reviewers who will critique and say that one season is better than the other. I think both seasons were full of great scripts .... having these shows lovingly restored to their B&W glory is incredible...the sound is A+. I am elated to finally have uncut versions of all the Munsters shows from those 2 brief and hilarious seasons.

I do agree with other consumers who gripe about Universals poor quality control. My season one box had pixillation and tracking problems, and the storage box for season 2 is poor design cut out of cereal box quality cardboard. Shame on you Universal!

Get the Munsters 2 seasons and treasure them...now, if the owners of CAR 54 would wake up we'd get more Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis....I'm waiting!",1132963200,7,1255,4.791666666666667
2393740,5,B000ATQYX8,"Two reviews: One for the actual DVD content and one for the packaging. The DVD content is a 10/10. The packaging as you have already read is a 1/10. It would have been nice to have some outtakes (if any exist). The bonus stuff is good but is available on the Biography channel. Anyway, it's great to have this wonderful series on DVD now and even if the packaging blows it's well worth the cost. Now if we can only get the Odd Couple and the uneditted WKRP series on DVD....anybody listening out there?",1132876800,4,502,4.351063829787234
2393741,5,B000ATQYX8,"...the packaging for the second season is, hands down, the WORST packaging EVER. It's nearly impossible to slide the folding ""case"" in and out of the sleeve. The folding case is too flimsy and starts to buckle when you have to put 500 foot pounds of torche to get it in and out of the sleeve. Not to mention, Herman's bolts catch on the sleeve EVERYTIME. I am lucky I haven't torn them off yet. I am sure that it's only a matter of time. It would have been nice if the packaging would have been like the first season. It was clever, well designed, and not too over the top. God forbid we get a case thats practical and just does what it should, which is protect the dvd and keep it dust free. What a concept!",1132531200,8,708,4.13768115942029

The first set I got had a pixilation/freezing defect in the middle of ""Underground Munster"" on the second side of the first disc...DARN! DARN! DARN!  Fortunately, the replacement I got from Amazon works fine.  Viz, to wit and ergo, it's a good idea to watch all these episodes promptly (it only takes about 14 hours) so you can easily exchange your set if necessary.

2393744,5,B000ATQYX8,"Let this be a lesson to anyone trying to be ""cute"" and ""orignal"" when it comes to packaging extremely popular and long awaited tv box sets: This is not the way to do it!  No Munster fan can possibly be disappointed with the sharp, clear quality of the sound and image of this forty-year-old classic.  The packaging, however, is a total disgrace!  It's beyond belief how something so flimsy and ""cheesy"" could ever have been chosen to house the second and final season of one of the greatest tv comedy series of all time.  Heads should roll ... and I don't mean Hermie's!  Within fifteen minutes of having received this set in the mail, I had decided to cut up the packaging and make two colored photocopies of the plastic wrap-around cover.  Using the original cover and the two life-like photocopies, I have placed them in three separate dvd holders which now protect my Munsters (Season 2) collection.  Buyers beware!  The packaging of this lot will be a total disappointment, but the Munsters, well, they're the Munsters and will always please.",1130716800,7,1047,4.745856353591161
2393755,5,B000ATQYX8,I always watched Re-Runs of the Munsters.it was truly a one of  a kind show.just in time for Halloween&there was nothing quite like seeing the Munsters Crib. that Crib was truly haunted. Grandpa Munster was a Fool.always tripping. Eddie&the Mommy were funny as well. the Niece was cool.those Episodes always had me rolling.the Horror look on people's faces when they would encounter the Munsters is Classic.,1130630400,,407,5.166666666666667
2393756,5,B000ATQYX8,"On DVD, Season Two of the 1964-66 cult classic tv series The Munsters is better than ever, masterfully restored with sound and great picture quality. Season Two was better than the first season and the antics of the Munsters made hundreds of American households laugh their heads off. It is not as well-written or witty as the script for The Addams Family, and the Munsters catered to a more laidback, working middle-class audience. A lot of it was physical comedy. Six foot something Herman Munster was a walking disaster area and very low-brow and Neanderthalish, a working stiff and prefigured Homer Simpson. His loving wife Lily Munster (Ivonne De Carlo) is a vampire woman who is a housewife and far less glamorous than Morticia. Their son Eddie Munster (Butch Patrick) is a child were-wolf who thrills in engaging in mischief and adventures. Grandpa is a centuries-old vampire who feels he is still hip and young. The episodes' greatest comedy was the sharp contrast betweenthe creepy, abnormal, Halloween-honoring Munsters who look like they are eternally wearing their costumes and the normal, straight 60's people that live around them. A great buy if you are a fan of the old classic series.",1130630400,3,1201,5.01

GOOD LUCK GETTING THE DISCS OUT, AND THEN THERE ARE THE DISCS. YES, THEY ARE ONCE AGAIN DOUBLE SIDED. WHAT A HORROR!!!. GOOD LUCK TELLING THEM APART. POOR BOX DESIGN, POOR DISC LAYOUT, MY STAR RATING IS ONLY BASED ON THESE ISSUES. HAVING THE MUNSTERS SEASON 2 IS A TEN STAR RATING!!!.

2393758,4,B000ATQYX8,"I can leap with joy that my Munster collection is complete.  I am so excited to have bragging rights and ownership of the ENTIRE Munster series on DVD.  Who can resist the humor of Herman Munster?  The transfer to DVD is brilliant and of INCREDIBLE quality.  Any fan should have NO complaints about the collection, except I DO prefer one-sided dvd's with some art work on them.

Now, a word about that packaging.

That outer plastic sleeve was SO tight, I had trouble getting the Herman Head out of it.  But once I DID, I NEVER got it back in, because it was ruinning the sides of the head once I TRIED to put it back.  This was a TERRIBLE idea on the marketing department, and whoever's idea it was should be FIRED!

I wound up useing two blank DVD cases I had and taking the Herman Head apart and creating my own slipcovers for the dvd cases.  Now, it looks FANTASTIC, even my family is more impressed with it then before.  Also, it looks better on my shelf next to season 1.",1130371200,5,977,4.284153005464481
2393759,4,B000ATQYX8,"The idea and concept of the package is indeed unique,however the
finished product is awful in quality,ease of use and storage is
difficult at best! It took me all of 15 minutes to open andremove
the inner head from the outer plastic sleeve and i still caused
some damage in the process to the flimsy inner cardboard head.
The concept is cool,thats as far as it goes. Universal could have
had the same exact concept applied to the two tier package box
of season one which is of good quality and was also very unique!
The change to me was to save money as this season had bonus
material,season 1 did not. The dvd quality of the set is superb
and the bonus material is very good,five stars worth,but the
package drops it to four. One thing i didn't recall with season
two was the title of each episode being dropped from the screen
after the main theme song. Overall excellent job by Universal
for seasons one and two and the package of season one and the
concept of season two! Maybe they will release a remake storage
box for this season two set,it would be nice! I hate to have to
add this but,i encountered a problem last night on the very last
episode on disc 1 side B ""Hermann picks a winner"" - the dvd
freezes! The Abbott & Costello syndrome strikes again,if you are
not aware of what that is,check all the reviews on that
Universal release,terrible problem with the two-sided discs
freeezing! I have an expensive Sony dvd player,so it is not the
dvd player,i also tried it on another dvd player and play-
station 2 - same problem. There isn't anything noticeable wrong
on the disc surface - it just freezes for 30 seconds. When i
spoke of the dvd quality,i meant with the transfer,i did not
expect to run into this problem again! I will return it and
update this review upon my findings. 11/10/05: I was hoping for
good news on this update,but AGAIN,the replacement dvd freezes
through out an entire episdoe on disc 1,side A.I tried this one
on different dvd players,same thing! I contacted Universal and
their attitude stunk! I am now going to ask for a refund,i am
not going to waste anymore time watching defective dvd's! This
is an ongoing problem with this company,i have had it!",1130284800,7,2189,4.50251256281407
2393760,5,B000ATQYX8,"I don't think Universal was trying to package The Munsters Season 2 in such a way as to irritate us I just think it is a case of style over practicality. The Herman head packaging must have seemed like a cool idea that would appeal to fans of the show. Sadly, the idea wasn't entirely thought out. I agree with others that the inner package (die-cut in the shape of Herman's head) is very difficult to get out of the outer plastic sleeve. I struggled to get it out and had an even harder time trying to slide it back into the sleeve. My solution to this problem is to not attempt to put the head back into the plastic sleeve.

I did the same thing with the outer packaging they created for Season 1. The thing's not practical to place on a shelf with my other DVDs so I just have the inner cardboard case containing the DVDs alongside my other DVDs. I will probably place the new set there sans the outer plastic sleeve as well.

I know this kind of thing gets people very upset but, as I stated before, Universal didn't do it to get us angry. They were just trying to create a unique package.

5 stars for the series, 1 star for the package but 4 stars to Universal for trying.",1130198400,2,1178,4.180616740088106
2393761,3,B000ATQYX8,"I edited my first review as MyMunster3 clarified some things, and I appreciate it. So it seems that, unlike the reruns, when the show was originally aired you did not hear the crashing sound of Herman coming through the door during the opening credits until later in the second season. I have heard the crashing sound now on later episodes that I have watched. I still do not like the crappy box because as it was pointed out, you will have a terribly difficult time getting the dvds out. I contacted Universal and there is NO alternative box. I like the look of the box, just not the outer wrap which is so hard to remove. I do agree that the quality seems quite good and the bonus material is good. There are some brief cracking noises on a few episodes such as ""Zombo,"" and ""Happy 100th Anniversary."" But because of the good picture quality, I will upgrade the star rating to 4 instead of 3. Munsters fans should pick it up (crappy box and all).",1130198400,5,948,4.392045454545454
2393762,4,B000ATQYX8,"Last August Universal released The Complete 1st Season of The Munsters. The set featured all 38 episodes plus the unaired pilot, but no extras. An independent 2-disc (243 min.) Munsters release called The Munsters: America's First Family of Fright (with extras) from Image Entertainment was also planned to arrive on August 24th, the same day as the Universal season set release. Fearing consumers would be confused by what they would be getting from the two Munsters sets, Image pulled their release with the intent to simply release it at a later date. But then Universal expressed interest in using it as extras for the Munsters season 2 set. Universal and Image negotiated and voila! - The Munsters: Season 2 with extras. But not all of them.

2393763,5,B000ATQYX8,"Well not only is the second season of the Munsters coming out on DVD but it also features some extras that the first season did not have.  While the Munsters only lasted two seasons it did have 70 episodes which by todays standards would work out to over three seasons since most shows today only have 20 - 22 new episodes every season.  As a fan of classic Horror I've always loved the Munsters due to their geneology to the Universal Horrors of the 1930's  In fact, makeup Bud Westmore tutored under the great Jack Pierce who developed the look of Frankenstein, the Mummy, The Wolfman, and countless other monsters.

The thing about the Munsters is that at it's core they were a typical American family dealing with the issues that most families do, they just happen to be monsters.  Some of my favorite episodes from season two are:

""Happy 100th Aniversary""  Herman and Lilly are about to celebrate their 100th wedding anniversary, and each ends up taking a job to earn extra money for a present.  They end up working for the same ship welder and begin flirting with each other since they can't see the others face due to the welding mask.

""John Doe Monster""  Herman gets hit in the head and loses his memory.  He's adopted into the family by Lilly thinking he is Eddie's brother john.

""Herman, Coach of the year""  When Eddie is having trouble on the track team, Herman decides to coach him...and destroys the track at the same time.

""Just Another Pretty Face""  Herman gets hit by lighting and comes out looking like Fred Gwynne...i.e. Herman without the monster makeup.  Lilly is distraught and wants him returned to normal.

""Zombo"" comedian Louie Nye plays a horror movie hose named Zombo who eddie adores.  Eddie gets a chance to be on Zombo's show and Herman gets jealous.

""A Visit frm Johann""  Herman's cousin Johann comes to visit along with Dr. Frankenstein.  Johann looks like Herman but acts like the simple-minded monsters from the old Universal Horror films.  This is a classic.

""A house Divided""  herman and Grandpa get into a huge fued and end up dividing the entire house right down the middle.

8079773,4,B000ATQYX8,"Alleged digital enhancement coloration of Herman's face, neck and hands were wrong color because, the original movies had it at light blue and not light green. Herman was a far better character in his own right than Frankenstein's monster, even though it was the inspiration. I was a kid when when I saw ""Munster Go Home"" at the theater in the 60's and was a Munsters big fan and liked it before the alleged digital enhancement!
"" Munsters Revenge"" was trashed out the same exact way!
The black and white television series was great!",1498003200,,533,4.680851063829787
