6161573,5,B00HFBZB9M,Yes more One Piece this is the best yo thanks FUNimation you make us all proud. Can't wait for more to come.,1389916800,10,108,3.9545454545454546
6161574,5,B00HFBZB9M,"getting to see ace vs blackbeard, is going to be epic, i remember watching this in japanese, it was awesome, but having it dubbed in english will make it so much better , ""i prefer dubbed over subbed"" but thats just me, you all have your own likes. Back to the DVD, the voice acting will be done at a professional level, including the release of the thriller bark arc, we will see brook, geko moria, and a whole lot of continued exploration of other characters, this dvd however will mainly revolve around Ace and Teach, battling each other, another big part in this dvd is that we will see franky, as part of the straw hat crew, no longer just at water 7, drinking cola and boasting how super he is... well he may still do this. but this shall be a great dvd to buy, having all these great moments dubbed in english is fantastic, This is a must have for all one piece fanatics.

ps: when you realise that by the end of this year, early next year, we will see hancock and the beginning of the impel down arc.",1389830400,16,1008,4.22279792746114
6161575,3,B00HFBZB9M,"One Piece is awesome it's been a while since I haven't been watching all new episodes of it, it sucks English Dubbed is around over 300 episodes for One Piece and English Subbed is at over 600 episodes, this is pathetic.",1389571200,3,220,4.390243902439025
6161576,5,B00HFBZB9M,"One of my favorite animes, it has an awesome story. I can't wait for the next season to come out.",1401753600,,97,3.9
6161577,5,B00HFBZB9M,"Who can miss ordering the next phase of this series. I love One Piece and if you do, then you want this. Although it is a bit crammed with extras, but they don't leave you regretting this purchase.",1400716800,,197,4.2105263157894735
6161578,5,B00HFBZB9M,"It's been MONTHS since this one came out, and usually their advertising for the next one almost immediately so where the heck is the box set with the Brook episodes that come right after where the episodes in THIS box set ended??",1399680000,,229,4.476190476190476
6161579,5,B00HFBZB9M,"Funimation, Hurry!!  Feed me more!!  This series is hilarious, entertaining, and by far amazing with character development with full on action.  Its a great show that my daughter and I bond on watching every time a new one is released.  Fell in love with the voice acting in English that its hard watching this anime in particular with subtitles.  As slow as its being released though, i might have to  revert in doing so!!!",1399593600,,424,4.662162162162162
6161580,4,B00HFBZB9M,"After the phenomenal Enies Lobby arc One Piece takes a bit of a breather with this set after the first episode and veers into filler. While not bad filler, fans of the manga are waiting to see Brook make his gran appearance and the zany antics of Thriller Bark. It is a good set and the duel between Ace and Blackbeard has long reaching consequences. It shouldn't be skipped, but don't expect it to have Enies Lobby levels of epicness.",1398556800,,435,4.45
6161581,5,B00HFBZB9M,Glad to see One Piece taking off again after that long cp9 arc. The CP9 arc was great but they drew it out a little to long,1397088000,,123,3.5925925925925926
6161582,5,B00HFBZB9M,"great release, much happier with the lower price than previous releases too. Excellent set up for season 6 release too.",1396915200,,119,5.0
6161583,5,B00HFBZB9M,Awesome as always when it comes to OP specifically ace vs blackbeard the dub of this fight was A+ and the filler was enjoyable too shocking I know just can't wait for thriller bark!!!,1396137600,,183,4.411764705882353
6161584,5,B00HFBZB9M,"That hasn't been said before, I'm a die-hard fan - and eager to see what the New World brings! If you've slept on One Piece because it seemed to childish or cartoon-ish - you've got the wrong idea my friend. It may be heavy on comedic relief - but that's because its HEAVY on BATTLE BASED TENSION. Once you've gotten to Water 7 and beyond you'll be hooked, but I was hooked since Season 1 - Voyage 1 (Im glad I started watching after FUNiMATION licence rescued it from 4kids who we're destroying the whole dynamic of the series - One Piece is not Solely, meant for kids, Its a show that can appeal to all ages and fans of all types of anime IMO. I will continue to support all the releases until the sad day when the series ends (which I really can't see happening anytime soon haha)

The characters are the most original, and unique - non-static/archetypal characters in all of Shonen period (IMHO), no scratch that, possibly in all of anime period.

Also the Action in a Shonen series hasn't gotten me this on the edge of my seat/pumped up since I was 9-10 watching Dragon Ball Z for the first time in English in its first syndication. This series IMO - has set the bar even higher than Bleach, Dragon Ball Z or any of its competition/forerunners - by being so original in its characters, premise (pirates! I don't think there's been a non-space Pirate anime ever, that in it itself is genius), and how it executes its plot arcs. Not to mention how the crew grows *spoiler for those who aren't up to this set yet* including the ship - overtime, getting new members who become integral parts of the dynamic of their team. All the characters are lovable, and the VA's are amazing (yes, sanji and zoro, remind me of trunks (less so on sanji but if you listen, and are as big of dbz fan as I am you'll notice lol) and Vegeta. Roronoa Zoro I've said on many occasions is like Prince Vegeta on copius ammounts of Valium Hah! And Sanji is a chef savant Trunks with more of a bad ass back bone, who doesn't take any crap - but this makes their in-fighting EVEN MORE HILARIOUS if you imagine it from the dynamic of vegeta and trunks haha atleast in my mind - because it changes the dynamic from foe-friends, to parent-son)

To be honest Ive never felt the same copius ammount Levity from an anime, without losing its action/dramic tension - that I have in One Peice since Dragon Ball Z - so the VA casting makes perfect sense in my head. and I love all of the VA's Brina's Chopper, and Luffy - I don't know how Colleen Clinkenbeard (what an awesome last-name for a VA playing the most bad ass Pirate in anime, and I'm not poking fun - that's serendipitous synchronicity! - Like she was meant to play Luffy haha) Can do Luffy's voice day in day out (and not wreck her vocals completely) all the time and still do her female voices in other anime's is beyond me (milk-and high intensity singing on the way to work aparently hah, but in the booth she still sounds feminine and not raspy but when she pulls the Luffy lever - its like ""Is that REALLY coming out of her mouth?! That's astounding -  god she's talented).

I can't wait to see how **spoiler if you haven't seen Strong World Movie yet*"" Skeleton Dude (his name escapes me ATM) joins the crew (oh how Ive wanted to hear that VA Serenade us since his portrayal of Excaliber in Soul Eater!! One of my favorite comedic relief characters ever, ""FOOL!"" ahaha)

and **also spoilers for those not finished with this set** Frankie/The Sunny (I must say the sinking of Merry, brought tears to my eyes (as do alot of moments in this series - it touches your heart, and makes you feel every emotion under the sun, when they have a victory - you feel that victory in your being and celebrate with them), they really made her a part of the crew, important to the story progression and anthropomorphized the ship itself, now The Sunny is an awesome edition to the crew can't wait to see what other tricks Frankie's build into that bad-larry (although I woulda sworn Paulie at first glance would've been ""Smoker"" just cause he's stacked with cigars haha)

Another thing that makes me SO happy about FUNiMATION. They LISTEN to their fans and take their advice into consideration. I wrote them an email saying how the Chopper/Brina ""On The Boat"" interview was repeated on two of the different sets, and gave them what I thought would be cool idea for more behind the scenes at one piece/funimation studios - like a glimpse into the recording process, the booth/acoustics, where they record, how they record, what software they use, how the engineer, director and voice actor/actress interact, and alot more technical stuff.

(I'm in no way claiming I'm the only person who suggested that, or that it was my sole email that caused it but being a recording artist - these are the things that interested me the most, and also they seemed to have gone through most of the central VA's on the On The Boat Inteviews, it was time for something new IMO)

and They ACTUALLY LISTENED! The next sets had exactly what I was talking about - from the recording process, vocal warm ups, glimpse at the director/engineer/va's in the actual recording booth - etc etc. Not only the fact that they took my suggestion and made it a reality - but also did it so fast. I emailed them, a month later the next set had these behind the scene ""In The Booth with One Piece"" extras. I was ecstatic - and I hope thats a trend that continues; onto other popular series that they produce- the one thing I would say most releases, especially given the price point on some of these sets that aren't Blu Rays or BluRay/DVD Combos, it gives us fans a little more incentive to buy the physical medium versus steaming digital or pirating (which is, IMO, a double edged sword - helps animes names get out there, and lets fans who do support but are under financial strain - to see the series and support by buying it when they can - but if those pirated downloads don't boost sales or the overall notoriety of the series, its really hurting it - I can understand how series can be hit or miss and you don't want to drop 50-60 bucks for something that might end up not being that good but if you do enjoy it and want/expect more - support it! Buy it in some fasion!). These sort of things help to intrigue buyers - even more in this rough economy. If we want all our favorite series to flourish and new innovative (not copy cat or, simply fan service) series to keep coming we need to support in every way possible

I also think that the studios can have an equal part in boosting viewer support by listening to their fans - as they did with my email (and possibly other emails, talking to fans at conventions etc) by giving fans MORE incentives (than just an textless OP/ED and commentary on 1 or 2 tracks - which as a fan of MST3K/RiffTrax - and the late Cinematic Titanic - Commentaries unless they bring the Hilarity/Comedy to the table or serious insider incites - get boring, no offence intended!!) to buy the dvds, or special editions (other than just art books, or soundtracks - artcases - which are beautiful, and fantastic to have available but they appeal to a smaller crowd - we need more things that appeal to more than just certain sub-crowds of what is really a large audience of viewers from all walks of life, age, race, profession, and other interests).

I'm just letting all the fans out there know that, FUNiMATION in particular care about their fans (not saying other companies won't/don't - I just have direct experience/proof of it in FUNi's case) - and WILL take your suggestions into consideration if you have something that is truly a good idea/original idea to pitch to them. Even in a friendly email like I sent, through their support/contact us page - to let them know that it's possible the Chopper/Brina ""On The Boat"" interview was erroneously put on two different sets - the day it was released - knowing they wouldn't of done that on purpose - and I guarantee you they appreciate these sort of things more than you could imagine.

I'm sure that helped my suggestions - since it was attached to a technical issue they had to address somehow - to get to the proper people, through the proper channels and someone said ""Hey, I've heard a few other people/fans of ours, go out of their way to express interest in extra features like this - perhaps this is something to look into for next quarter or our next release.""

Because I showed my love/passion for the series by doing them a 'solid' - you know?

I didn't have to go out of my way to type a long cohesive email, letting them know about the technical issues and also a long list of suggestions/ways they could make the extras on the one piece (and all their releases in general) more interesting, unique (as far as the whole anime industry goes) and give the fans to learn something about one of their favorite art-forms that they may of had no clue about before (say for the two documentaries, focused more on the art of voice acting than one show in particular, Bang Zoom Entertainment's Adventures in Voice Acting - I know there is another one which I've yet to see - but that documentary and extras like these on One Piece - helped me improve my own vocal technique (and the importance of warm up exercises across the board, from elocution, enunciation, pronunciation, how to project your voice/more dynamically use it - and the importance of tea - can not be understated) in my home studio just by watching the masters at work, the green apple thing to as a sort of natural de-esser is genius - (it must be the malic acid in the apple reacting with the saliva to cleanse the pallet so you get less of the ""Essss"" sound in words - just as important to control as, much as humanly possible while record, as plosives, words with a lot of force, usually starting the sentence or bar in my case - like  ""BEAT"" or ""POP"" (which is why we need shock mounts and pop filters)

Most people would've - weeks to months later - complained on the forums, or some fan site/forum - which might not get seen by the company at all. If you see a technical issue, go to the source! People are people are people, just because they have a dream job or are higher in the ""Echelon of society"" (if you chose to look at things such ways - labeling people, things, situations or even things you do yourself, can lead to bad mentalities - and negative scripts repeating in your subconscious holding you back, making you anxious, whatever it may be)

It's blatantly obvious that, even the people who work on the show, Love One Piece and Enjoy making it/meeting the fans who love it so and hearing feedback from them, and they want all the support they can get to continue to make this fantastic show. So of course they're going to hear you out if you've got a good marketing idea, that's also an insider look into what can be ""mysterious"" world of voice acting in anime (and recording in general if you've never had experience in a home, project or professional studio).

 ""Sound is what happens when air is pushed"" - said the head of The Jet Propulsion labs to quote the best book on home/project studio acoustics I've ever read by Mitch Gallagher of Sweet-Water - this alone was a ""!"" moment of revelation about understanding acoustics on such a basic level - from how to bass trap/broadband frequency absorption/diffusion/floating floors and ceiling clouds - to mic technique in the booth/how intense you go at the vocals/proximity to the microphone, etc - when I've studied it most of my adult life through text books, and articles on a technical level - but breaking such a complex science down to its utmost Simplicity or ""first matter"" if your an alchemist - lets your grasp it in such a better fashion and put to use your technical knowledge, now that you know it implicitly.",1395619200,,11836,4.4763670064874885
6161585,5,B00HFBZB9M,"If your a passive One Piece fan like am(was), this a great set to start with just for the fact that the first episode is Blackbeard vs Ace, which is one of the best fights in the series. This is the first step toward what I consider one of the best story arcs in any anime, Impel Down/Whitebeard War. My main gripe with One Piece is the sheer volume of episodes and, in my opinion, the lack in action in many of these episodes. But since I got this set I have dived head first back into the manga and anime and have not been disappointed.",1394755200,2,538,4.084905660377358
