8068956,5,B0009X4W0M,"This is a short film made by SAC probably for its own people or to show to local community groups. It is SAC described by SAC at the peak of its powers, at the peak of the cold war. Indeed, perhaps another intended audience was the Soviet air attache in Washington.

It is difficult to relate to the potential projection of power represented in the film unless the times of your life includes some of those days. They were serious times and that is the tone of this film. The SAC bomber and ICBM crews (as well as the fighter-interceptor crews and the submarine launched ballistic missile crews, to name a few others) were not at peace. These people had to confront and act upon the consequences of the unthinkable in their daily lives. And in doing that so credibly, they forced the Soviets to do the same thing and arguably saved mankind.

It's nice that The Mission of SAC has been preserved and is available. I bought a copy here. The film has not been restored but, other than one rough splice, it is fine.",1126396800,,1011,4.43010752688172
