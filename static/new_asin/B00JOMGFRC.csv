  The Picture is better than ever & so is the sound.  They have a trivia track for the movie when you watch it.  Plus 6 hours worth of features.  Like cast interviews.  Siskel & Ebert speaking about the film.  Etc, Etc.
  The film alone is worth the buy.  Plus the Hours of special features/bonus content makes it really a great buy.",1447286400,2,541,4.343434343434343

PULP FICTION (1994) is an intentionally fragmented religious allegory.

The movie starts in the story's middle, just after its most crucial scene has occurred. The ending reveals this moment: the conversion of a bad man into a true prophet of God and not a false one who liked quoting Biblical verse before killing his mark, also the doom of this converted man's partner, a non-believer who continues on an evil path until he's struck down.

You may remember early on that John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are shot at from close range and the bullets seemingly pass through them without harm. Jackson correctly recognizes this as both Divine intervention and a message that if he doen't change his ways he will surely die. In the diner, Travolta dismisses this as bunk, goes on to try and ""hit"" Bruce Willis, a boxer who was supposed to take a dive but didn't, and ends up dead when Willis uses Travolta's own automatic weapon to shoot him down.

If I were to put the film in correct order it would be:

Travolta's and Jackson's recovery of a briefcase filled with who knows what, the early morning murder of two men who had the case and the miracle.

The accidental killing of the third man in Jackson's car.

The scene at Tarantino's house with ""fixer"" Harvey Keitel.

Jackson's revelation in the diner about becoming a righteous wanderer and Travolta's rejection of the miracle message, an act that seals his doom.

The diner being robbed by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, with Jackson now demonstrating his newfound holiness: he lets them both live.

Travolta's non-date with Uma Thurman that almost ends in her OD death.

During this same evening, Bruce Willis wins a fight he's ordered to lose, then tries to escape the wrath of mob boss Ving Rhames.

The next morning, Willis goes to his apartment where he recovers his wristwatch and kills Travolta.

Immediately after, Willis encounters Rhames on the street; the two of them end up prisoners at a sdistic prv's gunshop.

Their narrow escape from death here is the story's actual end. There's a grudging truce between Willis and Rhames, but Willis must leave town. Jackson has gone off to be a prophet, Travolta is dead.
