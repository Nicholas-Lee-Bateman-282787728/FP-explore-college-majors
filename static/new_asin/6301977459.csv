Peers as well as psychological enhancements impose unto the likable priority and majorum of this film- not that of colossus or a gargantuan talent but a fairly simple, average, basic teen in identity crisis- tracing for his professions, assets, occupations as well as political heritage. Entwined in reveloution he performs with true emotion, amongst confrontations of maturity such as sexual mis/dis/pleasures, role in scenarios, independance, atmosphere and all. With prejudice still apparent, lurching oppotunities to evade his foundations as well as romanticism, naievity, speculation and a suttle prophecy in the air he is suited... Gradually accepting, shedding and adding to hiself- through love, through chivalry, prowess, abnormality, then anarchy.. He endeavours the rank of a demonstrative criminal to politics- nemesis and rival to his state only progressing to realise the tag to hiself- to quench his parched lust that thrives to realise who he is.

407191,3,6301977459,"I enjoyed it, but it doesn't make much sense unless you've read the book (OK, even then...)
The film is loosely based on James Kunin's book of the same name.  An undergraduate rower at Columbia University in 1968 feels  vaguely sympathetic towards student protesters but remains on the  sidelines.  He meets a radical girl, falls in love and gets involved.  He  winds up in a campus sit-in and gets beaten up when the cops clear the  building.
BOOK WEEK once described Kunen as ""...a soft-core radical  - a kind of New-Left Charlie Brown..."" which kind of fits; he was a  Gene McCarthy supporter.  The movie isn't especially preachy but the final  scene doesn't QUITE work as a summing up (not anymore, anyway!)",938131200,13,711,4.745901639344262

The acting is actually pretty good, although the plot is certainly dated and clichd, but that's to be expected for its age (1970).  I enjoyed watching it and spotting old student friends in the riot scenes.  It's miles ahead of a similar student unrest film, ""RPM"", which was also filmed in Stockton about a year later.

407383,5,6301977459,"Saw this movie in 1970 and loved it. Waiting for years for it to finally came out and very pleased it did. This movie introduced me to solo Neil Young and other great artists of its time. Influenced me to become active at my college campus as it did many others. Watching it many years later it is so much more than a 60's and 70's statement. It is the journey of one young man(Simon) who was lost and caught up in a dull and boring life that was  routine and had no meaning. Although he was on the rowing team it wasn't enough except he didn't know that at the time. As more and more unrest spread across the college(and the nation)he was starting to get pulled in. First by a girl then by all the injustice he was starting to see around him. Many young people of that era (and many today) start becoming more aware and questioning about this time in their lives. Simon started out as a boychild and trough events went from spectator to activist. While Simon was going through all these changes there was also a wonderful love story taking place using the happenstance of protest as its backdrop. Similar to Romeo and Juliet the couple were torn apart not by family but society as represented by the Police and National guard. Great ,great scene where everyone inside is singing and beating to the rhythm of Give Peace a Chance and the police and national guard are getting ready for war. To sum it up this movie is about a young mans journey into awareness, a viable love story and a window into the unrest that took place in our country during that time period.",1365120000,5,1564,4.374570446735395
407384,1,6301977459,"""The Strawberry Statement"" (1970) is a well edited college campus unrest film that in comparison to another like it in its day, Michaelangelo Antonioni's ""Zabriskie Point"" makes the famed Italian director's supposed ""misfire"" with critics and audiences seem like a ""masterpiece.""  ""The Strawberry Statement"", based on a book  by James Kunen is so unbelievable and mindless at times it dissolves into being boring despite the editing and musical soundtrack of then current songs, a lot by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Neil Young and others.  The characters are not well developed and are uninteresting (the leads are played by Bruce Davison and Kim Darby, both who were better in other things and not very box office).  Others in the cast are James Coco and Bud Cort, both wasted.  The dialogue and plot are insipid.  The script by Israel Horowitz does not make sense, especially the plot.  It is totally unbelievable and contrived to appear ""with it.""  The film was directed by Stuart Hagmann.  It is very disappointing that at such a time as it was in 1970, and the direction Hollywood was going for its new generation of film-goers, such an uninteresting and dull film could come out of M-G-M, too (as was ""Zabriskie Point""), that totally could not capture the vitality and involvement of the ""movement"" it tried to depict.

407469,4,6301977459,"Saw it in the theater when first released.  In contrast with several other attempts to convey the feeling of the student movement in the context of those days, Strawberry Statement almost got it right.

First.  The music.  The soundtrack is not only wonderful but really works with the film.  Thunderclap Newman's 'Something In The Air"", Neil Young's 'The Loner'...

The film is not about Kent State, as an earlier reviewer writes.  It's about the Columbia upheaval which resulted in the takeover of several campus buildings by students in protest of the university's decision to destroy a Harlem playground in order to build a gymnasium, as well as more general unhappiness with its connections with Dow Chemical and the war effort.

I was at Berkeley in the 'sixties, not Columbia, but we certainly knew what was going on elsewhere in the world.  This conflict was playing out in Mexico City and Prague and Paris, too.  In New York, the crackdown by the authorities was extremely violent, with hundreds in the emergency room.  The school was then closed for the rest of the semester.

It's hard to portray those days, especially the politics of it and the crowd scenes.  The street fighting I saw was very real, and I haven't seen it in any fictional account, not even this one.  But Strawberry Statement is much, much better than failures, such as 'Getting Straight'.

Very much worth seeing.  And if you're under 40 and want to know how it really was, this is at least a pretty good hint.",1325289600,10,1492,4.76953125
407470,5,6301977459,"This is an old movie fictionalizing the mood and the reason of the May 1970 Kent State Riots/Massacre.  It sneaks up on you, is harsh, bland, and sometimes dumb in this realistic portrayal of the disaffected, angry, populist student uprising against the war in Vietnam, which resulted in the death of four students by National Guard Troop's firing into the crowd.
I had the unlikely entre into the movie in the filming which took place in Stockton, CA in 1972 (?) when I took comp time from my desk work to see what was going on and became an 'extra' all-of-a sudden.
I'd wondered about the film, later, and finally bought my copy through Amazon...to see if they kept my footage in the picture.  They didn't.  In fact they apparently had to re-shoot most, if not all all of it, in San Francisco...with the blurb at the onset that other cities had not 'cooperated' with the filming...saying ""Strawberries are irrelevant."" There is some violence portrayed in quick cuts, some gratuitous sex (mostly referential) and a couple of shots of brief nudity, but the movie seems to quite fairly portray the student part in the anti-war movement...and its unfortunate consequences for the students.  I got mine on sale from Amazon. It only cost $23.95 with shipping...total.

When Neil Young's ""Down by the River"" came on in the soundtrack, my life was changed forever.  It started both my journey into politicalization and into the joys of rock & roll.  Can't think of any other movie that has  made such a strong impression on my life, and I've seen a whole lot of movies (thank God for TCM!).  This may not be a mainstream movie and may not have a lot of appeal to those who weren't around at the time, but I've been looking for it for a very long time and am really glad it's finally available.

407472,5,6301977459,I saw this movie w/ my Dad when I was in 7th grade(1969). I fell in love w/ the music and bought the album. Still have it. I saw this online and had to purchase it,1305504000,,163,3.5555555555555554
407473,4,6301977459,"You had to be there or at least you have to be intrigued by the  on-going concept of polarization (which is what ""The Strawberry Statement"" , both the James Kunen source book and movie, is really about).  Others should give the film a wide berth which should be easy to do as ownership complications with the music rights continue to keep this interesting counter-culture film from a DVD release.

The title comes from a statement made by a Columbia University administrator in response to student demands for more say in the administrative decisions of school.  He said something to the effect that the opinions of the students meant no more to him than whether they liked the taste of strawberries.  Needless to say this simply played into the hands of the most radical of the students and became a rallying cry for the protests that would rock the university.

The film transports the events from NYC to a fictional university in San Francisco, at least in part because ""The City By the Bay"" was quick to offer its location to film makers; even though the area had its own considerable student protest legacy (The Free Speech Movement, The Oakland 7, and People's' Park come to mind).

Taking its character motivational elements and cinematography style from Haskell Wexler's  ""Medium Cool""  (1969); it is all about a ""Man With A Movie Camera""  (1929) observer gradually being pulled through his lens into the action itself.  A little broken camera symbolism.  In both there is a surprisingly authentic feeling romance, which serves as both a tension release and as a source of character motivation.

The action he has been observing is essentially a ""Hellbound Train Effect"" as the young students aggressively test the system and the authorities stubbornly refuse to defuse the situation.

The film includes a great period soundtrack which I owned before I had even seen the movie.  The songs nicely complement what you are seeing on the screen.  Neil Young's ""The Loner"" gets an especially good montage effect.  Joni Mitchell's ""The Circle Game"" (sung by Buffy Sainte-Marie) bookends the film and the morphing of the hero (played by Bruce Davison) from distanced jock (crew team) to involved student.

There is a curious foreshadowing of Davison's signature role in ""Willard"", a film he made just a year after ""The Strawberry Statement"".  Instead of conversations with a house of rats he talks to the cockroaches in his kitchen.  There is probably a metaphor there but just exactly what it is escapes me.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1245456000,,2557,4.911421911421911
407474,5,6301977459,"The movie goes back to the ""good old days"" of 1968 when protest against the war and student uprising was at the forefront of the news. I lived through that era and can feel the spirit. It details the student takeover of a university in a believable way and the brutal suppression of that takeover. Although I use the term ""brutal"" it was probably the only way to restore peace at the school since the authorities were too permissive early on and allowed it to grow. It does resonate with some of our current problems concerning the ""war"" and suddenly becomes timely. It's set against a tender love story and the casting can only be characterized as brilliant. The lead characters win our hearts. It brought back a lot of fond memories.",1204329600,4,735,4.575757575757576

To his credit, he was amused, rather than alarmed, and I was admitted. It was easier then. The movie has remarkably little (next to nothing) to do with the book. It isn't set at Columbia, for one thing; it's meant to be somewhere in San Francisco  (I'm not sure where it was filmed; SF State?) and virtually all of the the characters are, well, caricatures. The author of ""The Strawberry Statement"" actually spent some time with Columbia SDS chieftains like Mark Rudd and John Jacobs and prominent Outside Agitators like Tom Hayden; there is no one who is remotely recognizable as an individual in the film apart from the two leads. There were political as well as cultural issues that were important at the time, but the film's theme is more or less ""revolution for the hell of it"", which certainly isn't the leitmotif of the book on which it is supposedly based. Bruce Davison's character seems like a pleasant, not very bright guy, and Kim Darby was really good in ""True Grit"". Of the ""Viet Nam Era"" films on my shelf, ""Medium Cool"", which isn't set on a campus, comes closest to catching the atmosphere of the time as I remember it. ""A Small Circle of Friends"", set at Harvard around the time of the strike in 1969, is pretty good, and miles better than ""The Strawberry Statement"". I'm not sure what ""Getting Straight"" and ""The Strawberry Statement"" were intended to do, apart from sell popcorn to a few kids, but they certainly won't help anyone who wants to understand what was happening on campus in the late 60s/early 70s. Parenthetically, there was an update and interview with author James Simon Kunen in a recent issue of the alumni magazine. After a lengthy career as an attorney and corporate communications honcho, he's teaching English as a second language now. Not surprisingly, he looks much older these days, but happy and engaged. His days at Andover and Columbia are pretty remote, but the book remains worth reading for anyone who wants to get a feel for the 60s.
