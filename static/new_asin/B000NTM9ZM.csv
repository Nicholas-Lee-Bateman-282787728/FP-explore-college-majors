2781022,5,B000NTM9ZM,"Back in the early 80s, I recorded this HBO production of Camelot on my VCR. I still have the tape and would watch it if I had a functioning VCR.  I am a musical theater junkie and this production of Camelot with Richard Harris by HBO in 1982 is so wonderful.  HBO is finally releasing this production of Camelot, filmed on stage at the Winter Garden Theater in New York, on DVD.  I have pre-ordered it and cannot wait to see it on DVD, as my VHS tape is getting a bit worn.  Bravo HBO!!!!",1173398400,35,488,4.105263157894737

Much to my surprise, this felt more like a chase for the Holy Grail than trying to find a reproduction in any format. I have such fond memories of all of the HBO theater series which aired when Camelot came out, but this was to me by far the best.

Never realized how much the film omitted, but there is a lot more material in the stage version that came from the original books by TH White (especially the Merlyn scenes).

Harris seemed bored by the whole thing.  I have read other people's review of this production saying it was better than the film version.  Come on folks!  The motion picture was magnificent and under the direction Joshua Logan he gets a fantastic performance out of Richard Harris.  It is sad to see the way Harris said his lines, in this production, with no emotion.  Stick with the great motion picture version of a great Broadway musical.",1404518400,3,596,4.841584158415841

2781085,5,B000NTM9ZM,"I was lucky to see this production of Camelot when it aired on HBO, and I was enchanted by it.  I was so happy to find it out on DVD.  Richard Harris is wonderful as King Arthur.  He plays Arthur as a true innocent who, as he goes along on this journey, learns the harsh lessons about life and love, yet still manages to give us a glimpse of hope at things to come.  By the end of the play, as tears roll down his cheeks and he proclaims ""For One Brief Shining Moment!"" I found myself with tears in my eyes and glad to have been along for his journey.  Meg Bussert as Queen Guenevere is simply marvelous.  (If you close your eyes, it's amazing how close she sounds like Julie Andrews).  Richard Meunz as Lancelot is also very good.  He does well playing Lancelot as a sort of fop we all love to hate who eventually shows us that he's more than he seems.  The three main leas do their parts justice.  Be warned though, if you've never seen Camelot before, this is not a ""light"" musical by any means.  Though it visually looks like something Disney would produce, (and the sets are a joy to look at), this is very much an adult musical.  It's amazing how this play starts off very light in tone, only to become very serious and touching.  Most people know the story and of the ill-fated love triangle between the three main characters.  Lerner & Loewe should be given a lot of credit for crafting a lavish tale such as this that deals with such grim subject matter yet handles it beautifully.  There are no simple solutions and many of the characters have to live with the choices they've made.  There's no tidy ""happy ending"" if you will.  You get a wonderful musical with lavish sets and costumes, some great tunes that will stick with you, but you will also experience various emotions along the way.  The actors are wonderful to watch.  The camera angles and close ups reveal their facial expressions.  Though the song ""What Do the Simple Folk Do?"" is very light and comic, it's the undertones and the body langue of Harris and Bussert that reveal the character's true feelings.  Arthur is starting to realize that his marriage is coming apart and is helpless to prevent it.  Another review has stated how Richard Harris doesn't really sing in this musical.  You have to appreciate Lerner & Loewe.  This is not a big, splashy musical with showstopping tunes.  Many of the songs are simply sung dialogue.  Check out some of the songs from their other musical ""My Fair Lady.""  Rex Harrison did much the same thing with many of the songs in that show as well.  I only have a few complaints about this DVD.  One, I would love to have had it in Blu-ray.  And Second, I would have loved to have had some special features.  Be sure to read the small enclosed booklet by Meg Bussert, but that simply left me wanting more.  Other than that, this is a great musical that was filmed with a lot of love and care.  It's truly a classic that hopefully you will enjoy as much as I have.",1397001600,7,2973,4.3765996343692875

2781088,5,B000NTM9ZM,"I loved this version of Camelot.  It is taped on stage on Broadway.  It was on HBO in 1982. Then there was no way to get a copy, as HBO never released a VHS version, nor were there any DVD versions.  Now, Acorn Productions has released it.  I was SO HAPPY TO FIND THIS!  It is NOT A MOVIE, but a PLAY.  I was able to teach my children about the elements of a play, and the basic story of King Arthur and the Round Table using this.  If you love Plays, and musicals, you are going to LOVE THIS!  It is recommended for family viewing by the National Education Association.",1368230400,,570,4.072072072072072
2781089,4,B000NTM9ZM,"There will probably never be another Julie Andrews or Richard Burton, the original stars of this brilliant show, whose problem has always been the book.  That said, this performance, with its lovely music and a book severely reduced in length from the original is a okay.  The best way to 'watch' this DVD is with your eyes closed.  The text and (of course) the score are alwlays a delight to hear ... but ... compared to the original luminous production, this one is rather dreary, dark and wrong-headed, probably because of the theatre's recent penchant for realism ... look at what they did to 'Oklahoma' ... and cutting costs.  The story of 'Camelot' is a kind of 'fairytale'.  There is no need for 'realism'.

2781093,4,B000NTM9ZM,"I remembered this presentation of Camelot from originally watching it on HBO 30 years ago. I find that I appreciate it now more than I did then. The cast gives a spirited presentation, and in certain cases the singing is improved over the highly regarded movie version.

But first, let's cover the qualities of the DVD. Seeing as it was mastered from tape with some age on it, it looks surprisingly good. Many scenes are extremely sharp, while a few do have some grain. However, don't be fooled by the opening credits. They look terrible. Once the play starts the visuals improve significantly. The colors are rich, and although the set is usually somewhat dimly lit during this production, the colors come through as strong and varied. We watched this on a 55"" wide-screen, so any flaws in the video presentation should have been magnified, unless by some chance our Blu ray player or receiver are doing outstanding jobs at up-scaling.

Some reviewers complained of problems with the sound, but we did not experience that. All the dialogue was clear to me, and the music sounded uniformly sharp. There were a couple of issues with high notes in Guinevere songs, but I don't know if that was the voice of the actress or some distortion. I couldn't really tell, and these occurrences were infrequent and brief. They did not annoy.

The production obviously embraced the performances of the film, as the director did not decide to go off on some tangent to stamp his own interpretation onto the material. In some of Richard Harris's songs, you might have almost thought he was dubbed by the movie's soundtrack. The timing of the delivery and the notes were not exact, but they were VERY close.

Richard Harris did seem a bit subdued compared to the film, almost as if because of the film, he already knew that this story ends in tragedy. While certain parts of his performance were not as crisp as the film, he didn't get multiple takes on the stage, so that is understandable. His depiction of Arthur's pain was deeper than the film, maybe because an older Harris knew more of pain by the day of this stage production. Let's say that in this play, he made his grief real.

Meg Bussert as Guinevere is a better singer than Vanessa Redgrave, but doesn't give the same delicious acting performance. However, she fills the role adequately, and does sell it.

Richard Muenz doesn't seem to get as much stage time as Lancelot did in the film, and I felt I barely knew him before the romance between Lance and Jenny blossomed. He did a great job on C'est Moi ... possibly my personal favorite song from Camelot ... and injected just the right amount of humor into it, an element not present in the sumptuous juxtaposition of song and travel depicted in the film. Unfortunately, his rendition of ""If Ever I Could Leave You"" comes in a VERY distant 3rd to Robert Goulet in the original and Gene Merlino's dub of Franco Nero in the film. It really is a very pedestrian performance of a signature song. Muenz's voice just wasn't full and rich enough to carry off this song. I think he knew that, and in trying to make up for it wasn't completely on key throughout the song either.

Barrie Ingram was creditable as Pelenor, but doesn't compare to the great Lionel Jeffries.

James Valentine is wonderful as Merlin.

Richard Backus as Mordred delivers a competent performance, but is in no way the sinister presence David Hemmings brought to the film, or what through the soundtrack I can imagine from Roddy McDowell in the original play. In this production ""The Seven Deadly Virtues"" is just a song that quickly comes and goes, not a defining statement of character and a menacing warning of things to come. To me, Backus looked like what would happen if you tried to place Shaun Cassidy in an evil role.

I never had an opportunity to see the first run of the play with its impressive cast, though I own and enjoy that soundtrack. We only have two visual presentations of this material: The film Camelot and this stage production. I prefer the film, but this makes for an entertaining change of pace from watching the film yet again. There were some alternate decisions about which songs to include here, so you will get to hear a few that weren't included in the film. Unfortunately, to make time for those songs, they dropped ""Take Me To the Fair"", which I thought to be a necessary build up to the tournament.

Speaking of the tournament, there is a song from the chorus that decribes the action from the tournament to the audience. It reminded me amusingly of the Ascot race from ""My Fair Lady"".

To sum up, this is an imperfect but enjoyable production of a signature musical, and one of the last great musicals (1967 version) to be filmed.

Recommended.",1352678400,,4747,4.65035799522673
2781094,5,B000NTM9ZM,"Richard Harris is brilliant in this stage production, playing the light comedy at the start delightfully, and absolutely breaking your heart during the tragic ending.  He's MUCH better than in the movie, and that was excellent too.  Note how drained he seems as the cast are taking their bows after the final curtain - he can hardly raise a smile, such is the intensity of his performance.  I never had the privilege of seeing him on stage, and now I never will, but this DVD is an enduring tribute to a fine actor in arguably his greatest role.

Arthur is the newly crowned King of Britain and is disctinctly uncomfortable with his lot - as well as with his upcoming arranged marriage to Guenevere, a political arrangement to prevent a war. However, when he does meet Guenevere, the chemistry between them is evident and Arthur realises he cannot live without her.

Now a happily settled king, he must set about establishing his dream of a utopian kingdom, with justice and fairness for all: might for right instead of might is right. He meets the man who is to become his best friend and champion - Sir Lancelot Du Lac of France. Unfortunately Lance and Jenny (as they are affectionately known to Arthur) will fall in love themselves and this will be exploited by Arthur's illegitimate son Mordred to bring about the death of the King's dream.

Richard Harris exceeds the quality of his performance in the movie version, especially in the electrifying final 15 minutes when he seems to BECOME Arthur, such is the intensity of his grief as he bids farewell to his 2 greatest loves and contemplates the return of the hated battles he tried so hard to dispense with forever.

If your soul is alive and well, you shouldn't miss out on this wonderful treat.",1345593600,,1754,4.675324675324675
2781095,5,B000NTM9ZM,"I have always loved the stage version of Camelot. My husband took me to see Camelot on stage in Minneapolis for our Anniversary. Our local PBS station, later, had shown it. I have looked for it online for years. I was delighted to have found it on Amazom.com. I can now watch it at home, and remember our Anniversary. It is extremely special now that Richard Harris has passed.",1333497600,,377,4.478260869565218
2781096,5,B000NTM9ZM,"I could have been a Camelot groupie because I first saw the movie in the 60's, and I've loved it ever since.  But I never had the opportunity to see it onstage.  This video gave me that chance and I really enjoyed it.  It was amazing to see how well Richard Harris was still able to transform himself into King Arthur even though he was not as young as he used to be!  Not many stars can do that.",1332115200,,396,3.9746835443037973
2781097,5,B000NTM9ZM,"I remember watching this version when I was a kid. I was hooked from the start. Richard Harris is genius as Arthur, and I always felt Meg Bussert was gorgeous with excellent comedic timing. I honestly can't understand why anyone would give this 1 star. I tried several times to watch the motion picture version and consistently turned it off after Franco Nero showed up (he is rather attractive). That movie was so painfully slow and devoid of every humorous moment. Whenever I want to watch Camelot, I always go back to this HBO Box Office production. This is a classic, and anyone who reviews it poorly is clearly full of their own self-importance, with a desire to only show off how ""fluent"" they are in theatre terminology. Do yourself a favor, don't listen to morons who complain about grainy picture, and MTV staging. The music is gorgeous, the acting is superb, and it is Broadway theatre in your home. In an age of Justin Bieber, Britney Spears and a whole host of other lip-syncers, it's refreshing to see people with real talent, giving their all on the stage. If someone can't find the greatness in that, I truly feel sorry for them...and thus they clearly know nothing about what makes theatre truly great.",1313193600,,1218,4.696261682242991

Richard Harris puts everything he has into his role, you can even see how drained he is at the end.  Meg Bussert is delightful as Guinevere & Richard Muenz brings some humor to Sir Lancelot.

2781100,5,B000NTM9ZM,"I have been a huge fan of this musical since I was a teenager, first through the film production, then later through the original cast soundtrack and reading the play. I enjoy this play so much that I have listened to the movie soundtrack at least 5,000 times I'm sure. Yet, I have never had the privilege of seeing the production on stage. No fan of Robert Goulet or Richard Burton, I much prefer the voices from the film, so what a delight it was to discover this film of the 1982 production. Yes, I admit Richard Harris looks a bit old in places, but no more so than Carol Channing in her farewell tour of ""Hello Dolly!"" and who wouldn't want to see Richard Harris in this production. And I thought both actors who played Lancelot and Guinevere sublime and believable. Guinevere's beautiful gowns alone are worth watching the production to see. And ""The Lusty Month of May"" had fabulous props and was beautifully done. This may well be my favorite production even over the film. A couple songs are sadly absent - ""Fie on Goodness"" and ""Take Me to the Fair"" and Morgan le Fay's appearance has been removed from the show - but it is overall a splendid production. While I can imagine the sets might have been a bit more colorful as some of the 1 star reviews state, the legend is primarily a tragedy. This production walks a fine balancing line between tragedy and comedy, resulting in a very cathartic experience that may bring tears and definitely brought me goosebumps! I will definitely enjoy watching this production again and again and again!

2781101,4,B000NTM9ZM,Excellent presentation.  Better than the film.  Most musicals should be filmed on stage to give the home viewer that experience and the feel of the live performance.

2781116,1,B000NTM9ZM,"Run away Guinevere, run away! While there may ""not be a more congenial spot than Camelot,"" this Camelot is ruled by a king who is more leche that liege.

As a former Broadway director/choreographer and actor, and one who has directed Camelot as well as seen many productions of it including the original, you can not begin to imagine my utter dismay with this production.  From the moment the aging and foppish Richard Harris began prancing about the stage without motivation or apparent direction while mugging to the audience and incessantly twirling his stadium scarf like some amateur stripper twirling a boa, I was appaled. I was not expecting Burton; was only hoping that I might find the King Arthur of the film; but certainly did not expect to find a Richard Harris festooned in undecipherable garb and topped with a blond page boy hair style makimg him appear (and act) more Duke (Patty) than King (Arthur).  What Harris lost in appearance and demeanor he totally forfeited in acting and singing.  While never all that gifted an actor or singer, what little gift he had has since been given away. . . far, far away.

Meg Bussert's singing was adequate but she seemed unsure of who her character was exactly.  Was she the young frightened innocent finding herself in a strange land to marry a man she had never met, or a modern day twenty-something looking for someone, anyone, with whom to ""hook-up.""  We are never quite sure, but this audience member could smell the wood burning beneath the stake during the opening number in which she seemed part Guinevere and part Ado Annie ready to break any moment into a quick rendition of ""I'm Just A Girl Who Can't Say No.""

There is simply nothing to like about this production of Camelot.  The sets are symbolic of nothing; the properties are anachronistic such as the yard lanterns carried in the medieval wedding ceremony; the staging is something you might expect from a director of MTV videos (Oh, that's right, it was directed by an MTV video director!); the choreography is Martha Graham meets Monty Python; the sound is as if it were recorded in a box car; and the film itself is grainey and poorly focused.

Now the performace is not without merit.  I am currently using it in both my directing and acting classes at the university where I teach as examples of bad directing and bad acting.  It is perfect for that purpose.

Camelot is an under-appreciated Lerner and Loewe show and this production will do nothing to change that. Instead, and while I am loath to recommend film versions of Broadway musicals, buy the film version.  It is not totally true to the original and while Richard Harris still stars as Arthur, his boyish good looks come across more as impish rather than lascivious (as should be), and the production is breathtakingly beautiful.",1229817600,11,2817,4.757700205338809

2781120,1,B000NTM9ZM,"THIS DANK, DREARY PRODUCTION is so very far from the original inspired concept and its brilliant execution! The Camelot I loved I saw twice in Boston prior to its opening on Broadway. Even sat through a few scene rehearsals.

The sets then were bright to dazzling, ditto costumes and staging.

The movie: I saw half and walked out. I sat through this version because
I was home and had popped for the DVD, so I suffered through.

And suffer I did.

This cheerless weepy rendition, with initially dark, mottled sets made worse by a fuzzy tape production, acted and directed without the energy and inspiration (or sadly talent/charisma) of the original cast and production was downright depressing.

Harris' fey and fumbling characterization makes Arthur into an wistful, insecure fool in stark contrast to Burton's blustering energy. The rest
of the initial cast was light years above this languid miscast bunch.

Add then the lost or abridged songs and dialogue, the direction and casting failures and this sad version shouldn't be seen; it'll leave
a bad taste in your mouth/mind - everything.

Simple suggestion: Buy the original Cast CD, kick back, close your eyes and feel its energy and optimism, its romance and rollicking good humor. You'll get all the songs properly sung, complete with proper inflections and a lot brighter orchestration.

Richard Coote was cast as an amusing King Pelinore, and Roddy Mcdowall as a hateful, spiteful Mordred; his singing of the 7 deadly virtues was a little gem.  This 1982 version of the play was nice but missing the fire and presence of the original cast.  By the way Richard Burton sings worse than Harris.

This version, recorded from the Winter Garden theater's '80's revival, should come as a pleasant surprise to fans of the musical, in that it has clearer storytelling, excellent staging, and a wonderful cast (led by Richard Harris, who may be a bit old at this point to convey Arthur's youthful innocence and enthusiasm for the Camelot code). Missing from this production is the number covering Guinivere's clever and delightfully playful goading of her knights against Sir Lancelot in the joust: a pity, since it was one of the show's highlights. Meg Bussert is a beautiful and engaging Guinivere, and she sings with a power and skill Vanessa Redgrave (star of the film) didn't possess. Despite the stage-bound nature of this presentation, the sets are gorgeous, the performances are first rate, the color lovely, and the score is memorable (though not quite as thrilling as Lerner and Loewe's ""My Fair Lady"" which may be the duo's most lasting legacy. This version stays true to the innocence and the integrity of the original play, in which Guinivere and Lancelot's affection was noble, not carnal--and it makes a world of difference in the tragic aspects of the finale.

1)The transfer is grainy. It's watchable, but again, I am surprised they didn't do a better job.
2)Whoever staged this was totally lacking in creativity. It was pretty blah.
3)Guinevere is not as bad as Vanessa Redgrave - but she's certainly no Julie Andrews. Yes, that is an unfair comparison. But it must be said. Her voice is quite lovely. Alas, she has so little emotion, it's like watching a block of wood.
4)They cut some of the best music. What is this about? ""Then you may take me to the fair"" and ""Fie on virtue"" are missing entirely, and ""Lusty month of May"", ""What do the simple folk do?"" are abridged. It's sad.
5)Does Mordred understand the words beat and tempo? Enough said.
6)Lancelot seems to make his songs go on and on... is it over yet?
On the bright side - Richard Harris - while undoubtedly too old for the role does a splendid job. He is truly an old school actor. Unfortunately he had no one of his caliber to play off of. The costuming was very nice, as well. All in all, it really wasn't so bad. It just didn't meet my expectations. If you have to own a Camelot DVD this one is better than the movie.

As it is this is as close to a video transfer of notable stage production of this musical play as I have seen, and I have knocked off a star in my rating due to the quality of the transfer. Still, I will not complain; every thanksgiving the 1967 film version came on television, so being unfamiliar with the Richard Burton/ Julie Andrews version, my first King Arthur has been and always will be Richard Harris.

Unfortunately, in this particular version Richard Harris's performance fluctuates somewhat with a very strong and heartfelt brooding that lends unintended depths to lilting numbers such as ""What Do The Simple Folk Do?"" only to either try too hard to humor or distance himself from certain moments in the play. His relationship with Guenevere never does spark and so much is lost in translation in the process. The film version with actors closer in age managed to convey the frustrations of a love lost and forgiven with so much more pathos. However, Harris's performance during the last half just makes me wonder one thing: what if someone had dared to take this delivery, excise some of the giddy numbers and deliver a non-musical drama with Harris as Arthur? Something a bit closer to T.H. White's book, upon which this musical was based. Hmmm...

Despite all of this, I am so glad someone decided to preserve this on tape, no matter what the quality and wished someone had the bright idea to have done the same with 1961 production with Burton and his own revival later on. I can never get too much of this musical and I found myself truly captivated with scenes that were absent form the 1967 film version ie., Merlin & Nimue, and Mordred's performance of the ""Seven Deadly Virtues"" by Richard Muenz.

Another reviewer said that this performance should be heard and not seen, and I think this helped. Many times I turned my eyes away from the images and listened to the music and dialogue and was quite taken away by it all.

The other actors were quite capable. Guenevere, James Valentine, is closer to a Julie Andrews take on the songs and perhaps the most talented vocal talent in the cast. Lancelot was good, but the tempo of ""If I Ever I Should Leave You"" was slowed down a wee bit much to  my taste.

All in all, I'm glad they preserved this Richard Harris performance as King Arthur (was this his last?) and I wish they had preserved the Burton version too! I can never get too much Camelot!

A beautiful song that commands a very strong and forceful performance, but to sing it ""If.....Ever....I...Would ....Leave....You...."" was way too slow for my taste.  Yes, I must say it, I much preferred the Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet versions from the original score.  I still would recommend this revival.",1473552000,,643,4.898148148148148
