5423696,5,B00AFQSYCK,I enjoyed this film because it was not predictable.  The characters were given distinct personalities and motivations which were well developed by the actors.  I did not see the ending coming.,1375228800,,192,5.161290322580645
5423697,1,B00AFQSYCK,This movie offer a sad and pathetic journey into alternate lifestyles.  Its story line is weak and the acting is poor.,1374451200,,118,4.619047619047619
5423698,3,B00AFQSYCK,"First, at just over an hour, I don't think this can be considered a full-length movie.  YET it has a definite plot with plenty of twists and turns and a surprise ending.  And you can tell by the way it was filmed that the team behind it actually cared about what they were creating even if the final result was over-the-top cheese.  it seemed like they were going for a noir piece, with plenty of dramatic flashbacks filmed in black and white, reavealing the leading lady's dirty family secrets.  But the acting was uneven at best.  Also, the frontal nudity cheapened the story.  I'm not a prude; I just don't think it was necessary for the story to succeed.  Still, I was strangely entranced--I just couldn't stop watching the darn thing!

Two things I really liked:  1) The actor who plays Christopher (Christi), the mute young man who runs Luna Park, is compelling to watch.  He has a charisma about him that would really shine if he worked with an acting coach.  I couldn't take my eyes off him whenever he was on screen; and 2) Christi and Max share a gorgeous kiss about halfway through the film that made my stomach flutter.  We've all seen bad screen kisses--this one was terrific.",1373587200,13,1189,4.556603773584905
5423699,2,B00AFQSYCK,I did not even finish it; not worth my time. My other option (brush my teeth and go to bed) was more appealing.,1373500800,,111,3.869565217391304
5423700,2,B00AFQSYCK,"The bottom line is that it was just hard to follow the movie.  The production values were good, but the acting was pretty mixed.  There was a fair amount of full frontal nudity-- and that was nice!!",1373155200,5,198,4.324324324324325
5423701,2,B00AFQSYCK,"I don't know why i bother... much of the theme of these films are recycled rubbish that people actually get paid to produce... no originality, poor acting, poor quality.",1368576000,,169,4.862068965517241
5423702,2,B00AFQSYCK,"This film is simply not worth your time or money.  More specifically:  The acting is inconsistent, with Laura Reilly coming off best.  The character of Christopher (Taylor Caldwell)is mute, I suspect for no other reason than that he couldn't do lines and they could get more mileage simply from his waif-like appearance.  The film itself appears to have been made out of two different films spliced together: present day and flashbacks are stylistically and qualitatively so different that neither engages the viewer.  (The present day segments are painfully amateur, as if a bunch of folk hanging around by the pool said, 'Hey let's make a movie.') The romantic scenes lack sensuality and the relationships are not given time to develop or establish an emotional connection with the viewer -- you have to take the director's and writer's word that it exists.

The even shorter version of the film, drawn from the flashbacks, is included and is much better, but still lacked coherence.  It is reminiscent of the experimental films of the 'sixties and 'seventies; daring once, passe now.

For a truly excellent film on a similar subject, try ""From Beginning To End"", a Brazilian import with fine acting, writing, directing and cinematography.  And, in fairness, a much bigger budget.",1362873600,3,1282,5.095693779904306
5423703,4,B00AFQSYCK,"Steven Vasquez returns with another dark entry to his film library, this time entitled LUNA PARK.
LUNA PARK is a full length spin-off of an award-winning short film, ROSE & ALEXANDER.
LUNA PARK has all the touches of a Steven Vasquez film, that we have come to know-- there are layered storylines, characters crossing paths, and a timeline that goes from present to past and back again seamlessly.
Like his previous films, A SIREN IN THE DARK for example, you must pay attention or you can easily get lost on the journey.
LUNA PARK has its moments of humor, but overall it is a dark story that is hard to explain without giving away too many secrets. I mean that in a good way. For, it kept me attention from start to finish and even then, I really did not see the end coming!!!
The performances are pretty on par with other gay indie films. Taylor Caldwell does a nice job playing the mute character. He easily gets his story across through simple eye and facial expressions.
LUNA PARK has a little of something for everyone, but is sure to please viewers that have a more ""twisted"" interest.
I would actually like to see what happens next with this storyline, as it seems it can take off in any direction!!!

The original short, ROSE & ALEXANDER, is included on the DVD as a bonus feature!",1361404800,2,1291,4.493617021276596

Yet for once there is no overt fear of showing the male genitalia, which seems to be forbidden in [too] many movies [gay or otherwise] now-a-days.  I did not have a hard time following the story line as it appears some did.  This was not a captivating film, but was more than okay to watch on my computer as I was doing some desk work.

5423741,1,B00AFQSYCK,I can overlook the bad acting and the disconnected storyline (did the writer and/or director even try) if it had an overall quality and artistic concept. But showing a bunch of ass and penis in harmony with a story about multiple layers of incest is both obscene and works against social advancement of the community. Provide me some artistic quality to save the taboo. I'm more than generous in that regard. But this film offered none.,1429747200,,436,4.75

There are some male actors and a lot of full frontal nudity, and that was clearly the reason they made the film and the real reason any person watches it or claims to like it.  There is no real quality of acting or story here I assure you, which is too bad as there are handsome guys, but when you want them to get naked it means they have crazy accents and can't act because they aren't actors in real life..",1423958400,2,518,3.9711538461538463

The story would have worked just as well had the flashbacks been set in the U.S.  I wonder if the actors cast happened to be French speaking, so the script was altered to fit their accents.

Acting was forced and heavy handed, but the actors were attractive and you got to see a lot of them, yep full frontal, that got me half way through the movie.

5423814,2,B00AFQSYCK,"Yes, I confess I watched it all, the whole time wondering ""How can *any* flick possibly be *this* bad?""

No, I still haven't figured out:
(a.)  How somebody finagled to find the money to ever finish, let alone release such an extreme rats' nest of a movie; nor
(b.)  What exactly kept me glued in slack-jawed astonishment at its sheer awfulness through to the very end.

Luna Park does display a rare a sort of grim surrealism that strangely snared my fascination:  hence two stars rather than the one.  Or I could have it wrong entirely, and rather than the dregs of bottom-feeding, no-budget queer movies--of which the digital age has provided us a mind-rotting surplus--this is actually a work of mad genius, truly transgressive art far beyond the tepid efforts of an Ed Wood or a John Waters, vastly stranger stuff than any of those Brit ""Art Movies"" made by the likes of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Greenaway/dp/1861890052/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Greenaway</a>&nbsp;or the late&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Derek-Jarman/dp/1861898606/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Derek Jarman </a>

Imagine, if you dare, a homo-dramatic telenovela--ostensibly in English, but with periodic and totally unexplained swerves into mangled faux-French (usually, but not exclusively, for conversations with God)--and I am only guessing the subject matter of the film here, about a fierce female media mogul/ex-porn megastar attended by swarms of very gay assistants who sporadically face the camera in utterly gratuitous full frontal nudity. All of that stuff is in English.  The French parts might be flashbacks.  The plot might involve a gay porn web-cam apartment complex owned by the vicious drama empress/media moguless, but theoretically managed by her mute (why?) and waifish younger brother (with ""serious emotional issues"" and Andy Warhol hair) who not only appears incapable of running his own hot dog cart, let alone a live porn site, but also in the climactic Big Reveal turns out to not be her brother, but really her secret second child, after she had inexplicably ""lost"" the first baby and furthermore one of these children may or may not have been sired by her brother (in which case the messed-up kid could be her nephew *and* her son, you know, sorta like Faye Dunaway's big scene at the end of Chinatown). Or maybe she was impregnated by her father? Or possibly it was the result of a rape? Who knows? One can only gather that Very Bad Things Happened. However, the who, why, or what dots are never connected from the extra-melodramatic back story to the events depicted on the screen.

Please be my guest if you might be inclined to watch Luna Park a few more times and sort out not only whatever the earlier tragic deeds might have been, but also explain how they effect whatever is happening in this flick.  One suspects there might be a shorthand code acquired from years of watching daytime soap operas known only to true aficionados that magically renders these murky waters crystal clear, but leaves those of us not fluent in sudsy symbology scratching our heads, muttering ""what the frak . . . ?""  I'm not about to venture back myself, but I would be sincerely curious to know if there is actually a story embedded in such a surfeit of enigmas.

The camera work and the editing are equally haphazard with neither of a quality up to par with the average Adult Entertainment Industry product. Apparently this is a conscious style choice in the service of enhancing the mood of the piece.  Nobody intentionally shoots such sloppy video.  As for the cast, I'll retreat to the safety of ""If you can't say anything nice . . .""  Apparently other reviewers here find the guys attractive. The Dragon Lady herself, weird dialogue aside, succeeds admirably in projecting a Not Very Nice Person. The biggest mystery of all, far more bewildering than either ""Who are these characters supposed to be?"" or ""What on earth are they doing?"" is how this total train wreck ever found its way to release not only on streaming video, but as also on DVD, which actually reqires real money upfront to pay for the disks and printing the artwork for the jewel boxes.  But what do I know about the market for pure, undiluted wall-to-wall sleaze?

Do not forget there yet remains the possibility, albeit an exceedingly slim one, that the movie Luna Park is a work of tortured genius and future generations will revere it as a pinnacle of surrealistic expression on the outer frontiers of experimental cinema.  I mean William Borough's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naked-Lunch/dp/0802122078/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naked Lunch</a>&nbsp;(*not* to be confused with the David Cronenberg movie version, which was a lily-livered cop-out) makes no sense whatsoever either, also features lots of naked boys, and plenty of people think it's brilliant.",1381536000,,4985,5.303299492385787
