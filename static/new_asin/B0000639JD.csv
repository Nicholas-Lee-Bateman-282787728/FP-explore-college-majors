1689513,4,B0000639JD,"Startling and ambitious vintage network TV production from 1966 is a heart-breaking and unrelentlessly tragic drama with Lee J. Cobb in such a supoerb performance, you want to reach out and console the troubled sympathetic character. So downbeat as to be almost dismal, the play succeeds in it's grip on the realities of grief and doom and the undying hope of a better tomorrow.  The rest of the cast is equally superb and I loved the fake realism of the CBS cameras taping a obviously theatrical set.",1065312000,17,501,4.758620689655173
1689514,5,B0000639JD,"If you want to see a production of one of American Theater's most important playwright's most important works, then look no further. Though there have been several noteworthy productions over the years, this Broadway Theater Archive treat showcases the ""perfect"" Salesman cast, in a treatment that is essentially a reblocking of the famed Elia Kazan Broadway premiere of the play. Willie Loman's originator, Lee J Cobb, reprises his role, along with Mildred Dunnock. Though Geroge C. Scott and Dustin Hoffman received critical acclaim for their interpretations of Willie Loman, neither holds a candle to Cobb. He simply ""is"" Willie. George Segal and John Malcovich weigh in about evenly in the ""best Biff"" category, but the nod goes to Segal, because of the great ensemble cast he was lucky enough to play off of. Yet another winner in a BTA series that chronicles American Theater in its greatest era (60's and 70s).
  Just a note to bear in mind that these plays are film versions of the plays exactly as they were staged on Broadway at the time, so don't look for cinematic production values. Sometimes the camera work is not ideal, but that doesn't get in the way of the consistently powerful performances, and that's what great theater is all about, anyway. I'm just grateful that most of the series is available and hope that the unavailable titles are just being restored and will be rereleased soon.

1689515,5,B0000639JD,"Acting like they don't do anymore forcefully and beautifully delivers Arthur Miller's story of a failed salesman and his thoroughly dysfunctional family. The message of the original play, definitely opposing certain traditional American values, was too threatening for some business executives and flag-wavers of the time to accept, and the issues are just as valid today. Yet the play is in no way preachy nor overtly political. Instead, it's highly personal and devestatingly effective. This version is somewhat reduced from the original Broadway hit but is not perceptibly damaged by the cuts. Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock, of the original stage cast, are excellent again--in fact, Cobb's performance is possibly the best acting I've ever seen in any medium. You'll recognize Gene Wilder playing Bernard, but he lacks expressiveness in the role. The bright colors are a little too cheerful for the material. Otherwise, the film is just about perfect. Good citizens should see it to understand more fully the effects--good and bad--of our competetive culture.",1027382400,20,1064,5.377245508982036
1689516,5,B0000639JD,... the closest you'll get to the original cast of arguably the greatest American play of all time. Stunning.,1024531200,8,109,4.7894736842105265

1689540,5,B0000639JD,"Despite a few cuts in Arthur Miller's dialogue, the tv version of Death of a Salesman provides all of the impact of a live stage production.  Surely, this is the mark of an ingeniously-written play.  Furthermore, I have shown this version to my literature classes, and I have noted tears from students, especially after the final confrontation between Biff and Willy.  Although I found Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Willy Loman original and effective, Lee J. Cobb will always be my Willy of choice.  The supporting cast, Mildred Dunnock (with Cobb from the original Broadway cast), George Segal, and James Farentino, are more than up to the demands of their roles.",1439424000,3,664,5.009090909090909
1689541,4,B0000639JD,"I liked the old Fredric March movie better, but the DVD is too expensive, so this more recent Broadway version is a good second best.  Burly, blustery Lee J. Cobb seems too powerful to play the beaten-down-by-life Willy Loman; pale, gaunt Fredric March was better suited, I thought.  But never mind, it's a great play, and Mildred Dunnock, who played Willie's wife in the movie and reprises the role here, is just as heartbreaking as she was in the movie.",1436572800,2,455,4.675

1689546,4,B0000639JD,I have seen Death of a Salesman many times.  I never get tired of it and I enjoy each actor's interpretation of Willy Lohman.  I had never seen Lee J. Cobb's rendition and was excited that you offered it on Amazon.  I had heard others say that LJC was the best Willy Lohman.....He was one of my favorite actors and I am delighted to own this copy.  Keep offering the old great classics.  Thank you Amazon.,1400284800,,405,4.276315789473684
1689557,3,B0000639JD,"Not complete and a TV remake with Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman. I would have liked, somehow, a recording of Cobb's original Broadway performance in the play's original run, but that's not possible. This is the next best thing to that but it is interesting to me only as a quasi-historical document.",1399680000,,296,4.60377358490566

1689559,5,B0000639JD,"I bought this instead of paying a fortune to see it on Broadway and I'm glad I did. The set design was interesting to watch in action, as this classic was performed LIVE for television broadcast. The story isn't for everyone, but this is a good version for anyone unfamiliar with Miller's play. Be aware: it's recorded in 1960's standards lower resolution 4:3 aspect ratio but riveting!",1383955200,2,386,4.776119402985074
1689560,5,B0000639JD,"Many fine actors have impersonated tragic, failed man, Willy Loman, but no one has crawled into the soul of Eugene O'Neill's seminal protagonist like Lee J. Cobb.

1689561,5,B0000639JD,"In general I'm not a fan of Great Dramas.  Mostly they are fictionalized psychiatric case studies of dysfunctional families, and who cares? I watched this because I was in a large group and it was this or nothing, and I did care, very much.  So much, in fact, that I didn't sleep that night, and that was definitely not a normal reaction for me.  Lee J. Cobb was one of the most underrated actors in the country, and why he never got an Emmy or an Oscar is beyond me.  There have been many versions of this play, but if there is a better one I don't want to see it; it might be fatal.",1370044800,,584,4.052173913043478

1689563,1,B0000639JD,"I ordered this DVD for my AP English class. We had just finished reading the play and I thought seeing it would be helpful. The DVD won't play on my DVD player in class so I tried using the laptop. It still wouldn't play because it had some sort of anti-copying block on it. Since I wasn't trying to copy it, I couldn't figure out why the block prevented it from playing. My class still has not seen this and I hesitate to order other DVDs to go along with other things we are reading because I am concerned that they won't play in class either.",1353974400,4,545,4.150943396226415
1689564,5,B0000639JD,"Classic theatrical production. I remember watching this on TV when I was very young. For years I thought of only Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman. And after watching the dvd again after all these years, Cobb is still the quintessential Willy in my opinion. What a great performance by Cobb, George Segal and the entire cast. Had forgotten about a very young Gene Wilder being in this.",1350345600,2,378,4.573529411764706

1689577,5,B0000639JD,"This is the best play of Miller's and of Death of a Salesman plays. The acting is phenomenal. Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman, Mildred Dunnock as his wife, James Farentino as Happy, George Segal as Biff and even Gene Wilder as Bernard. Very sad story. I love the way Miller shows the past on stage. I had to read this play in an Existentialism class and 30 years later bought this DVD from Amazon. I have seen many others including Dustin Hoffman's version. His was not bad but can't compare to Lee J. Cobb. This story reminds me so much of my dad's life. Struggling to try and make a living with hopes and dreams never coming into fruition. I really think it is just as relevant today as when this version came out in 1966. Arthur Miller was a genius. It is hard to believe that a man who writes like that married Marilyn Monroe. This play/movie excels in portraying the characters properly. The music also gives a hint as to what is happening. This is a must see play. Not much in the way of its surrealistic scene design but a very powerful statement about man's inhumanity to man.",1330300800,,1079,4.346534653465347
1689578,5,B0000639JD,"""Death of a Sales,"" with Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock, is fantastic. It made me cry, which is something I don't remember doing when I saw it before. I loved Fredrick March's and Dustan Hoffman's Willie Lowman, after all they are two of the most tallented actors to ever grace the silver screen, but until you've seen Mr. Cobb's Willie Lowman, you aint seen Willie Lowman. This production is very ""stagie"" but this is a ""play."" It's simpely perfect.",1316822400,4,451,4.65
1689579,4,B0000639JD,"This is a wonderful version of the great American play still timely for the present age though the play was written 60 years ago.

The cast and acting were excellent.
The play is dark, depressing and disturbing.  I had to get this movie for a graduate class in American Literature.  In a couple of weeks I will be doing my best to get it out of my head and will never watch it again.",1250035200,2,376,4.194444444444445
1689581,1,B0000639JD,"I bought this to show to my English classes and could not because it is in PAL format rather than NTSC. I contacted the seller to return the item, but got no response.

I'm sure the movie is fine-- it did come new, but it will remain that way since I don't have too many options at this point.",1239494400,8,438,4.093023255813954
1689582,5,B0000639JD,"I have always considered ""Salesman"" the greatest American play and saw the original production when I was only 15 and was floored.  But, even allowing for my then easily impressionable age, I still believe I saw, as near as possible, theatrical perfection. Since then there have been many hundreds (thousands?) of productions including some excellent ""revivals"".  But this is as close as you can get to that original production. Although the script was altered a bit because of tv constrictions, the power of the play shines through and you have the amazing performances of the original Willy and Linda Loman and a fine supporting cast.  This is a must for anyone interested in the theatre whether playwriting, production, ot acting.",1223683200,,733,5.091666666666667
1689583,5,B0000639JD,"Having assembled the vast majority of Broadway Archives and even classic movies, modern and B&W alike.......this along with Jason Robards in ""The Iceman Cometh"" simply stand alone.

After watching Lee J. Cobb in 12 Angry Men, On the Waterfront, certainly you can understand why he was one of the great character actors of his day.  But this performance stands alone from anything I have ever seen and heard.  It is as powerful, as resonate, as skilled a performance as one can expect.  It is said that when an actor can make you feel his pain, his suffereing, think his thoughts beyond the words...that is what happens here, it transcends the work itself almost.

I have seen many and heard many versions of this play (George C. Scott, Dustin Hoffman, Brian Dennehy, Frederich March, even Paul Douglas on cassette), but this creation of Willy Loman belongs only to Mr. Cobb.

The supporting cast is stellar, but they do revolve around this tragic truly American character, akin perhaps even to King Lear in a sense.  No one can heap to much praise for this production, you might as well start at the top if you're going to watch the American Stage on DVD in your home.  I don't know that we can expect to see something this powerful again.  It is that good.",1205884800,3,1257,4.65158371040724
1689584,5,B0000639JD,"Arthur Miller had a good ear for the foibles and traumas of the ordinary people of the old middle class put up against the wall in a world that was dramatically changing after World War II. The time of the man in the gray flannel suit and the victory of corporate culture that destroyed the old independent professions was not Willie Loman's time. In this play, seemingly only about the trials and tribulations of Everyman Willie Loman a used up salesman at the end of his career, the underlying tension is that he cannot keep up with those changes and therefore has to be discarded. This has a fallout effect on his personal life as well. He does not understand what has happened to destroy the integrity of his dysfunctional nuclear family. The old standards that had guided him do not stand up in the new suburban-dominated world where he must try to survive. Obviously there is some dramatic tension between him and his sons who have in their own way nothing but contempt for the old man, his old ways, his illusions and his duplicity. But also, as is always the case with rebellious children, love, at least their conception of it, as well. That this is not good enough to save him in the end is one of the lessons to be learned from the play. Read the play and see the Lee J. Cobb version of the movie. Cobb is Willie Loman.",1181174400,5,1330,4.43265306122449
1689585,5,B0000639JD,"Seeing Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman in this David Susskind produced version is as close as possible to seeing the original play on Broadway, and a far sight better than just about any live production one could find nowadays.

Mr. Cobb's performance is so absorbing, so powerful and so disturbing, that we, (the audience) feel genuinely dazed at its conclusion. It's as though, by the time of the final scene, that we too, are attending Willy's funeral, and all stumble away drained and awed.

The supporting cast are each and all superb, with Mildred Dunnock probably topping anything else in which she has appeared. Set design is also inventive in its combination of abstract and realistic interiors and exteriors.

As to the character of Willy, it is to Mr. Cobb's credit, that for all of his past moral compromises and shabby aspirations, the most honest of us, will admit that we recognize something of ourselves in him.

Theater and television at its best! Thank you Mr. Susskind. (Also interesting to note Karen Steele relegated to a bit role while still such a young woman--what a step down from ""Marty."")",1151452800,19,1110,4.826315789473684
1689586,5,B0000639JD,An insightful play about the realities of life. Cobb gives a standup performance in this classic play equal to none. Actors of his caliber are few and far between. Simply the best performance of this play to date. Lee becomes Willy in a somewhat scary portrayal. It is hard to tell the difference between Lee and Willy.
