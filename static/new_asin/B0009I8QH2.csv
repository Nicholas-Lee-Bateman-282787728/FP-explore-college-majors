8061148,5,B0009I8QH2,"A film on the consequences of mistaken identity in the world of organized crime. Deborah Harry, whose roll is supportive, is the Lulu in the film who possesses the answer to a gangster's quest for stolen goods. Despite this premise, the film is a comedy. Hanna Schygulla, a German actress, plays the lead. A frustrated writer who has difficulty selling her work, she is mistaken by the gangsters for Lulu. Alec Baldwin plays the cop who takes the case. The scenes are often disconnected, as though they were short film concepts strung together with a premise. Perhaps this is why the film did not do well. In the end, it was Deborah Harry's recurrent cameo appearances that keeps the film available (Deborah Harry fans are buying it).
If you do not know who Deborah Harry is (do you live under a rock?), wait to see it on cable or rent it once for the comedy.",1457568000,,859,4.548387096774194
8061149,4,B0009I8QH2,"Actually I love this film. There are some uneven parts, and Debbie Harry should have been used more, but every-time I see it I smile. It has a great 1980's vibe to it (1987) Great for 1980's movie fans. And every-one I've made watch this movie always love it.",1455840000,,259,4.3061224489795915

8061152,1,B0009I8QH2,This movie was not filmed in 3-D. This release is computer generated and manipulated. They are placing two slightly offset images in a stereo window and it does not have true depth.,1332374400,,181,4.6875
8061153,1,B0009I8QH2,"I had never heard of this movie before and I'm guessing Alec Baldwin fans haven't either. He makes his screen debut in this one and judging by how bad it is it's amazing he has enjoyed such a long career.

'Forever Lulu' is a weak rip off of 'Desperately Seeking Susan' that tells the story of two blonds (Hanna Schygulla and Debbie Harry) who get mistaken for each other and wind up in all kinds of dangerous situations. Harry plays the title character, a model, while Schygulla is Elaine a failed novelist turned toilet seat sales rep. One rainy night a suicidal Elaine accidentally holds up a wealthy couple and makes off with their expensive coats. At first remorseful she contacts the cops and tries to give the stolen property back to it's rightful owners but then decides to keep her ill gotten gains. She starts parading around New York in her expensive fur catching the attention of everyone from a beat cop (Baldwin) to a crook who assumes she has the envelope that was in the husband's coat pocket. Through all kinds of dumb twists and turns Elaine becomes a media darling appearing on T.V. talk shows and even getting her book published.

The DVD case is very misleading showing the two women together on the front. In fact they only have two major scenes together and Debbie only talks in one of them. Actually that's the only time Debbie talks in the whole movie. She appears in the background of plenty of scenes but is never given anything to say. If you're watching the movie for her you're gonna be disappointed. Baldwin on the other hand is the best thing in the movie. As a hopeless romantic who falls for Elaine he's both funny and charming. So if you're a big Alec fan and want to see him when he first began check it out. Otherwise avoid this cheap knockoff and stick with the Material Girl who did it much better.",1261008000,5,1837,4.513513513513513
8061154,1,B0009I8QH2,"Debbie Harry of Blondie made a very supporting role in this comedy/murder/drama that was a take off of Desperately Seeking Susan.  The comedy is weak and Debbie is in about 10 minutes of the film.  She looks great in her Stephen Sprouse outfit, but is lost in a movie that tries to be funny but is not and tries to be suspenseful and is not.  A stinker in every aspect.  Debbie took this role as she was attempting to make a comeback in the music and movie world after taking time off to care for her then boyfriend Chris Stein.  So I guess she thought this might be a funny film.  Sadly, it was not and the film was one of the worst of 1987.  Notable for the film debut of Alec Baldwin and one of the rare English speaking films for German Hanna Schygulla.",1188432000,5,757,4.179310344827586
