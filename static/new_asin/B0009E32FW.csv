8059354,3,B0009E32FW,"This program is not an overview of Yellowstone; rather, it is a brutally honest examination of the predator-prey relationships among the park's wildlife.  The numerous hunt scenes are neither sensationalized nor censored.  Sensitive viewers should be prepared to see cute baby animals killed.  The theme is the dichotomy of nature's beauty vs. the animals' constant struggle to survive.

If the subject matter does not put you off, then I recommend the program.  The cinematography is beautiful, and the narration is interesting.  Proponents of wolf conservation will be particularly interested in this documentary because wolves are featured throughout.

No special features, language selection, or subtitles are included.  I have given the DVD 3 stars (neutral) to reflect my suspicion that most viewers will either love it or hate it.",1183420800,9,837,5.484375
8059355,5,B0009E32FW,"If you are searching for a ""tour guide"" video of Yellowstone National Park, this is not the one. This documentary, however, is excellent at what is does, which is to present our first national park as a present-day crucible for understanding the delicate balance and inherent beauty in a large ecosystem. This is a good documentary with lucid perception.",1163462400,6,354,5.016949152542373
8059356,1,B0009E32FW,I was very disappointed with the content of this DVD.  I wanted to give this to friends as an introduction to Yellowstone National Park.  Yellowstone is a geologic wonder but the DVD never touches on the those incredible and varied aspects of the park.  It never gets past the animal food chains reflected in the park so most of the DVD is devoted to one species devouring another.  This is a DVD that parents will want to review before letting young children see it.,1151884800,11,467,4.523809523809524
