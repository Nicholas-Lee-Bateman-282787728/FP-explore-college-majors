5272094,5,B00960EHT0,"Chuck the one star review. ""God's Country"" was a well done, most enjoyable family movie. The message of faith and God changing the lives of long time believers as well as those who have never experienced a relationship with him was beautiful. The scenery was also beautiful. A desert which is God's creation can be a beautiful, peace producing place. I chuckled at a few funny spots in the movie. The best part was the sweet relationship that develops between two of the movie main characters which could well result in marriage. The women begins as totally driven, workaholic executive and ends up a new person. Believers lives are changed as well. I highly recommend this movie.",1369612800,3,680,4.82051282051282
5272095,2,B00960EHT0,"The story line was so predictable as to be laughable.  In addition, it just wasn't done convincingly. Don't waste your time on this.",1369440000,,132,4.739130434782608
5272096,4,B00960EHT0,I enjoyed viewing God's Country with my mother.  The film provided us with the opportunity to identify our own values and the place God has as the leader of our lives.  It was nice to see the lead character develop a heart for The Lord and for supporting an enterprise that will spread God's message to others.,1369008000,,310,4.421052631578948
5272097,4,B00960EHT0,"A Christian/message film that delivers the goods with humor, drama and Scripture.

Jenn Gotzon stars as a well off, driven executive sent to secure the property of a struggling pastor and the Christian retreat he leads in the Mojave desert about to fall to foreclosure.  A Casino is planned for the area, and she agrees to stay, incognito, 6 days learning about the place before the pastor will consider her offer.

She flops as a fish out of water trying to put up with the simple lifestyle and the Christians, but soon discovers there's more to life...

Ms. Gotzon is an accomplished actor.  Her goal in life is to inspire others, and she does.  Her director husband does a fine job; nice scenery and it's all put together well, although, of course, it's quite predictable but with a satisfying ending and given a family friendly 5 Doves.

Gib Gerard, the son of Gil Gerard and Connie Selleca, plays a counterpoint and potential romantic interest.

Good clean stuff to lift one up.",1367798400,,983,4.707602339181286
5272098,5,B00960EHT0,"In this flick, star Jenn Gotzon plays a successful investment banker who receives an assignment that forces her to question whether the financial victories in her life are worth the cost of precluding a life of real love. Her idea of expressing love is to write a big check or buy an expensive present. The mission, should she decide to accept it, is to discover the importance of relationships, especially one with God.

The acting was very good. Of course, Jenn Gotzon was stellar, but she had lots of help. The rest of the cast, which seemed to be comprised of all Hollywood actors, delivered satisfactory performances, which we should expect from a team coming from the fiercely competitive secular world of acting.  Gib Gerard, one of the stars, features a pair of intense eyes, which I discovered through IMDB research that he inherited from his mother, Connie Sellecca. I especially enjoyed the performances of Stephanie Barnes and Michael Toland. I think Stephanie, who was performing in her first feature film, has a bright future. This is the kind of acting that I expect from most Indie Christian films in the near future. God will either enhance and anoint the skill set of those currently acting in Indie films, raise up His children who are not getting the opportunity to act now, or will pull people from the Hollywood ranks to deliver his messages. The days when ""Christian films"" are noticeably substandard will come to an end as the genre and personnel involved mature, although some people may be reticent to acknowledge that rise to excellence. This movie is a good example of that maturation process.

Jenn Gotzon's husband, Chris Armstrong, did an admirable job as the director of his first feature film. The cinematography was excellent. The mountain desert features some wonderful sunrises and sunsets, and the DP of this film captured them both in addition to awesome skies and landscapes. The music is good, but mostly stays in the background, where it should be.  The plot certainly was not original, but had some good twists. The story presents a good balance of faith, humor, emotion, stimulating dialogue, and romance. What is there not to like if you're a believer in a sovereign Heavenly Father and His son Jesus Christ? If you're not, this wonderful movie might rub you the wrong way, not because it is not tastefully done, but because some people are offended by the gospel of love no matter how it is presented. If you're in the ranks of those offended by Jesus, you need to spend some time in God's Country.",1367712000,,2543,4.825688073394495
5272099,5,B00960EHT0,"This family friendly film was a delight.  It kept my interest all the way through, with a good blend of humor and message.  The desert was as much a part of the movie as the actors.  Jenn Gotzon did a great job portraying an ambitious, money and power hungry broker.  The directing by Chris Armstrong was excellent, he was able to take a predictable story and turn it into something that captures your interest throughout the entire movie.  He expertly guided the filmography.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film.",1367625600,,518,4.764044943820225
5272100,5,B00960EHT0,"This film more than exceeded my hopes. Jenn Gotzon was fabulous in the lead role and watching her character's transformation throughout the film was a joy to watch. She was very believable in the dramatic moments and her comic timing was fabulous! The rest of the cast were equally as good and had wonderful chemistry. Gib Gerard was an excellent foil and love interest to Jenn's character and you know that Michael Toland and Daniel Hugh Kelly are seasoned actors who had superb performances. The exuberance of Lenny (Kelvin Brown) and the sweet, idealistic Geri (Stephanie Barnes) really stood out to me and I also loved Meghan's mom (Suzanne Ford). Well done to all of the cast! I also want to say how impressed I was with director Chris Armstrong. Some of the scenes he captured were absolutely stunning, and the entire film was outstanding. This was a fun film that had a message of faith, but filled with characters you knew would stand firm in their trust in God no matter what.",1367539200,,985,4.699421965317919
5272101,5,B00960EHT0,"If you're looking for a great evening of quality family entertainment you need look no further than 'God's Country"". It is inspirational and moving - a movie that you will want to watch many times. Chris Armstrong's (in his first directing venture) does an exceptional job, especially with the breath-taking scenery. I look forward to seeing more of his work in the future. And the cast is superb. Jenn Gotzon really shines in this film and shows why she was voted Best Actress at both the Global Art Film Festival and the 168 Film Festival. Her portrayal of Meghan Doherty as a money obsessed worldly bank executive transformed by love and the power of God is brilliant and inspiring. The supporting cast is excellent as well - Gib Gerard (Jake Graham), Michael Toland (Eden Graham), and Daniel Hugh Kelly (Mr. Whittaker). Does Daniel Hugh Kelly ever age? Kelvin Brown's infectious humor as Lenny and Stephanie Barne's innocent (yet perky) portrayal of Geri are noteworthy as well.

But the story of God's Country also speaks to something bigger. It demonstrates the contrast between materialism and spirituality. What the human heart seeks will not be found in riches, jewelery, or Ferrari's (as Meghan discovered) but in the simple truth of God's love for us and our love for one another through community. The people of ""God's Country"" had found this truth and their acceptance of Meghan in love transforms her. We should seek to emulate this in our own lives.

The Apostle Paul wrote 2,000 years ago ""...brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things."" Those words are still relevant today and ""God's Country"" exceeds each one of those standards. I know you will be blessed by this wonderful film as I was.",1367107200,,1869,4.987179487179487
5272102,5,B00960EHT0,"How great it is to see God's redemptive hand directed so well in a Christian Film. It was a true pleasure to watch a Christian Film where the main character transforms slowly from every angle. The cinematography was exceptional in particular the beautiful shots of the retreat center. The cast was exceptional and had chemistry. Jenn Gotzon does an exceptional job at showing how God changes people lives and helps them re-arrange what really matters. My hats off to the director Chris Armstrong for creating very clever ways of making the scenery become a main character in the movie. Excellent film for a family, great laughs and lots to talk about afterward. Thank you for making an engaging Christian Film!",1366761600,8,710,4.925
5272103,5,B00960EHT0,"One of the things that plagues independently made films of faith is that without big studio backing there will be problems with such things as lighting, editing, music and sadly even acting.  There is no such problem with this film, it is positively brilliant and I have had the privilege of reviewing faith based and family films for years.  This is a film that should have been featured in theaters as there is a wide open expanse of beauty that harks back to the great old days of the John Ford epics.  Of course this is not a Western though it takes place in Western style territory.  There are also scenes in the metropolis of LA and here is one of the areas the film shines in.  You are taken back and forth from city to country, intercutting between scenes in a style often over looked in films today.  Certainly the director Chris Armstrong, who put this together, deserves credit for knowing his craft.  However, I have to single out one element in particular.  Though the over all cast is good, this is a Jenn Gotzon film and were this theatrical we would be talking Oscar.  Jenn Gotzon  plays a top notch business woman who knows the art of the deal and is at the pinnacle of the ladder of success.  Her assignment is to talk a preacher and his family into giving up his land, his dream, which is used as a campo for young people.  The preacher challenges Jenn to wait six days and during this time... well I don't want to be a spoiler.  I will just say that seldom has an actress had to make herself believable in so many settings and she pulls it off in the style of the great actresses during Hollywood's Golden Age.  Of course it is a faith based film and you will see the hand of God throughout the story.  The film is a miracle itself and I am thankful it was shown in a special preview screening.  I will say I am not alone in my opinion as the film drew the audience in a way I have seldom heard of and there was applause at the end.",1366502400,28,1952,4.249322493224932

It was wonderful to see the transformation of Megan from someone who was entirely self centered and not caring about others into someone who valued family and friends above money and possessions.  The parts of the movie where she first got to the camp and was wearing the high heels because she refused more sensible boots was hilarious.

5272132,4,B00960EHT0,"Idolizing a career and in essence - worshipping money and all of it's greedy and superficial trappings which the average man rarely attains, was the mindset, lifestyle and mainstay for the powerful and prideful, human, pompous peacock known to her underlings as the high and mighty, Investment Banker: Meghan Doherty. Her jet set mentality and aristocratic lifestyle, made her oblivious to the plight of those less fortunate. At best, she was indifferent to the lower class of society. Her arrogance was such, that those within the blue-collar world were ""beneath her."" And, in addition too her being shallow and superficial... her all to evident insecurity and deceptive mindset in thinking that she was better than others, only fueled her desire to be seen with those who she deemed were the ""right"" people. And most assuredly, it was only for selfish purposes, only. In that, only people of status and wealth, mattered. She was very uncomfortable with the average individual and the lower income sector of society. Especially, when it came to inner-acting with them. Namely, a bunch of Christians which she feared and avoided, at all costs. After all, she was 'Miss It!' Along with her needless fear of most of her fellowman, her flakiness encompassed the fact that she ""had too have"" certain clothing, jewelry, shoes and so forth, in order to 'fit in' and feel accepted by her piers. Or so she thought. She was all about projecting an image. All the while, she neglected to take inventory of who she was, within herself. And that failure, only caused her too remain, a scared, insecure and shallow woman, needlessly. Primarily, about what people will think of her, if she doesn't dress and act in a certain way. Sadly, she was all about pretentious appearances and ""keeping up with the Jones'es."" Not realizing, that in so doing, she was a follower and not a leader in character. She was always needed peoples, approval. Except of course, from those who deemed themselves Christians. Them..., she could do, without! But, she was about to get a rude awakening, too that affect. How? While moving in 'on a kill' of a foreclosure business deal of a 1000-acre Christian Retreat, Meghan - having been petitioned by the Pastor, reluctantly agree's to fore-go the foreclosure 'sale buy' if ""something else"" comes up, during her agreed 6-day stay at the Retreat. Feeling as comfortable as a goose in a snowstorm, Meghan gets a lesson or two in humility and the value of trust and true friendship, along with some personal insight and even faith, during her stay, there. And, how it all relates to how she viewed money, business, her boss, her fellow man and yes, even how she viewed, herself. A personal inventory check? Oh yeah! Suddenly, the lights went on and she saw the 'real' character of her ruthless boss and his ambitious quest to line his own pockets. Regardless of who he or his subordinates which included her, had to stomp on..., in order too make that money. This is a Faith-Based, Family Approved Film from Image Entertainment by way of Slingshot Pictures, which presents this color, 91-minute, single-disc, DVD movie which clearly depicts, that ""...the love of money, is the root of all evil..."" (I Timothy 6:10 KJV). And not, money itself! Money - is a neutral substance, a paper currency with value on it. Which in generous hands, can be used for great good. But, that very same money within the wrong hands, can be used for selfish purposes and even, evil transactions and deeds. This film depicts a light-hearted melodrama with a practical yet powerful message, with pockets of humor. All in all, meaningful entertainment for everyone.

It is a clean movie, a little predictable.

However, one of the actors appears to be on the verge of ""conversion"", yet the movie does not really work that way ... that is evangelize.  So .... in that sense, its okay, but not great.  It needs some work.",1372723200,3,314,4.288135593220339
5272208,1,B00960EHT0,Very poor acting and story line! We were so disappointed in this production and would not recommend it to anyone.,1370649600,,113,4.7
5272209,4,B00960EHT0,"I enjoyed watching the movie, it has a great message.  I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't heard about it, but it is a movie about redemption and God's provision when we put our faith and trust in HIM.",1370649600,,219,4.093023255813954
5272210,5,B00960EHT0,"While a lot of faith-based films are truly cringe-worthy to watch, Director Chris Armstrong has done an amazing job elevating this film far above its budget and source material.  The direction, editing, sound and cinematography are all exceptional.  Strong performances all around from the excellent ensemble cast but it is Jenn Gotzen who shines as Meghan Doherty, an ambitious real estate executive sent to oversee the foreclosure of ""God's Country.""  She arrives at the Christian retreat, tucked away in the Mohave Desert, with the intent to seal the deal and move on but the owner refuses to sign her offer sheet until she has experienced life on the retreat.  What follows is a great, fun fish-out-of-water story the entire family can enjoy as Meghan Doherty tries to navigate her way through six days in God's Country.  A well-crafted movie that is fun to watch.",1370390400,3,868,5.0
5272211,4,B00960EHT0,Enjoyed the way they brought the city and country together to show the good from both places. Enjoyed how they showed some things are more important than money.,1370217600,,160,4.75
5272212,5,B00960EHT0,"I've known Jenn Gotzen since before she was an actress, and I must say she has come a long way since making cheese steaks and ice cream cones at a driving range and miniture golf. Way to go Jenn!!!",1369785600,,197,4.076923076923077

8536408,5,B00960EHT0,"I can sit back and tell you that this is a moving touchy feely movie about learning to dream and care about someone  else. I can tell you it is well made well acted and has a great script. I hate it when these people that go and ruin a movie in their reviews by giving away the story, but this movie is hard to review without doing just that.
A big bank girl goes to a camp called God's Country to get them to sign off rather then be sold at to the highest bidder.  The camp owner and director says he'll sign if she stays the week and really tries to take part. At the end of the week if she still wants him to he'll sign. Though she stays her trying is somewhat limited, lol. Anything more you'll have to get from someone else or the movie. I hate ruining a perfectly good movie for someone.",1482796800,,793,3.981132075471698
