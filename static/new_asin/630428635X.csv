823056,5,630428635X,"This movie can be described in three words, and those are: Charming, Funny, and Teary.
In this Comedy-Romantic movie, Cher who plays a Widowed Italian woman, proves just how romantic this movie is.
You'll be  touched, in awe, and much more when you see this movie. I give it a five  star rating for this movie, because it always remains a favorite of mine!  ;)",964828800,,360,4.507692307692308
823057,5,630428635X,"This is a screwballed comedy that delivers.  Everyone can empathize with some the characters dilemmas. From the widowed character Cher plays that longs for a married life and almost ends up with the wrong guy, to the Mom  (Olympia Dukakis) that looks for a single answer to a big question (Why do  men chase women?).  Every character plays both their practical side and  their romantic side.  This was the heart of the movie. We all opt for the  practical, but hope for the romantic (moonstruck). I've seen this movie  over ten times now and I never get sick of it.  Especially, the final scene  at the kitchen table.",963100800,,617,4.62962962962963
823058,5,630428635X,"This movie is simply wondeful. I have seen it more times than I can begin to count, and I still cannot find a single fault in it. The acting is superb from all angles - from the actors in the fore-front to extras with  only three lines EVERYONE comes across perfectly and realistic. The plot is  well-written and executed, and the soundtrack works seamlessly with the  action. The best part is that it no matter how many times you see it, this  movie will continue to be as enjoyable as the first time. In fact, I think  I love it more with every viewing. It may help to be from an Italian family  like I am - because only then can you see just how realistic the characters  are. I could point to every one of them and give them a real-life  counterpart. But even if you aren't you will appreciate it for its  brilliance. This is one of my all-time favorite movies (if not the number  one). I could go on, but just trust me and see this movie!",962496000,3,943,4.188888888888889
823059,5,630428635X,"Nicolas Cage, Cher and Danny Aiello are involved in a strange 3 way love affair. Two brothers who do not speak to eachother fall for the same woman. Set in modern day Brooklyn, this story of lust and love is surrounded with  the Italian/American flavor that is the thread of Danny Aiello's best film  work. Throw in Olympia Dukakis as Cher's ugatza mother, and Vincent  Gardenia as Cher's Sfachima father, and funny things happen. Add a star if  you're from Brooklyn, add 2 stars if you're Italian.

This isn't just a movie, it's the  tradition of story telling at it's finest.  The music, settings, and  characters tell such a fine, truthful tale, I swear I can smell the food in  the kitchen, dining room, or restaurant - you'll see what I mean when you  see the movie!",947808000,,445,4.556962025316456

823445,1,630428635X,"i have always been a fan of romantic comedies, and i've even been able to enjoy formulaic ones such as the wedding planner and it could happen to you, but this movie is just too awful. the acting is atrocious and cher is just way too old for the part (is she supposed to look fifty?). personally i love nicholas cage but there is nothing appealing about his character in this movie and the thick black hair all over his body certainly doesn't help.
none of this would have annoyed me greatly had the lines in this movie not been so hokey and badly delivered. i think i laughed, at most, twice, which is sad since i am easily amused if the lines are halfway witty. if you rent this movie you probably won't die from sheer mortification that such a bad movie could be made, but Moonstruck is certainly not a good enough movie to buy!",1023926400,4,831,4.2993630573248405
823446,5,630428635X,"This is a very funny romance.  A widow approaching middle age and living with her parents in Brooklyn, accepts a proposal from a boring, but reliable man.  He goes back to Sicily to tell his dying mother about it.  She is charged with telling his estranged (and Strange) brother about it.  They instantly fall in love.  She refuses to end her betrothal, but agrees to go to the opera with him.  In between, her family causes confusion.
This movie is very funny and the cast couldn't be better.  Although it helps if you are Italian and come from Brooklyn, the movie appeals to everyone and I find myself watching it again and again.",1010793600,,632,4.539823008849558
823447,5,630428635X,"I just loved this movie - I have seen this so many times and still find myself completely in love with Nicholas Cage and his tormented, passionate demeanor in this flick. He and Cher light up the screen and you find yourself wanting more at the end. Another hopeless romantic film that you just can't get enough of.",1009929600,,315,4.448275862068965
823448,5,630428635X,"This movie doesn't have to be driven by gags and star hype to get to the end. A tremendous script and great performances by supporting actors rounds out Cher and Cages' acting. The side stories of parental discord and search for romance complement the central love story. Vincent Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis were superb in their roles. The wave of chaos -brought by the moon- into all of these people's lives is marvelously written into parallel stories. The release of tension at the resolution is such a palpable relief for everyone that its almost a euphoric moment, especially for the viewer.",998784000,,597,4.920792079207921
823449,5,630428635X,"This film stands head and shoulders above all cinematic romantic comedies.  It is virtually flawless!  The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful!  Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is captivatingly delightful!

Every character is peculiarly delightful and  memorable, from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles -- Olympia Dukakis , Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack!  Each of these performers, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work.  For many of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also exceptional -- and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film.

I've seen this film several times all the way through -- which can deflate the impact of a film substantially.  More tellingly, I realized some years ago that whenever I channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted.  I agree with the reviewer who raves about the scene depicting original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters.  But there are so many others that have stunning impact -- Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: ""Don't sh-t where you eat!""; Danny Aiello at his dying mother's bedside; Nicolas Cage ""taking"" Cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background!

There are many great romantic comedies, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially the Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart/William Holden original); When Harry Met Sally; The Apartment.

None holds a candle to Moonstruck!",992822400,10,1925,5.231270358306189
823450,5,630428635X,"Okay, I am of Italian descent and originally from Brooklyn, so I can say that it is quite a realistic portrayal of that American subculture. But that aside, I found this movie wonderfully uplifting. I saw it in Copenhagen, subtitled in Danish (which I can speak and read)and it was a riot to see how they translated Italian-American Brooklyn English into a foreign language (didn't work too well!!!)Anyway, this movie will give you a lift anytime. Cheers for Cher, she did a marvelous job. As did Nick Cage.",985651200,,507,4.7727272727272725
823451,5,630428635X,"I absolutely adore this movie.  Every time I see this movie I laugh out loud it is so funny.  I love the grandfather and his five dogs who howl at the moon mainly because I am a huge dog lover.  Actually, in some ways the grandfather is my favorite character, he is only around for comic relief, but he really makes me laugh almost every time he is in a scene, especially in a very tense moment at almost the very end of the movie where no one is talking, and he says: ""Someone tell a joke.""  I love how this movie is like a snapshot of a traditional type Italian family.  Italian is a beautiful sounding language and, even though I have almost no idea what the words mean, I love listening to the characters talk in Italian.  Luna is a much more beautiful sounding word than moon.  I love Olymphia Dukakis in the role of the mother; she is just wonderful.  Nicholas Cage is a mad man in this movie-but his character is hilarious.  My favorite scene with him is after the opera where he is trying to convince Loretta that she should chose him over his brother.  The arguments that he uses are both logical and illogical at the same time.  I love it when Loretta (Cher) describes Ronny (Cage) as the wolf who chewed off his own hand to escape the trap of loving the wrong woman--because Ronny is a very wolfish-like character.  The only other movie I have seen with Cher in it is Mask.  She did just as good, if not better, in this comedic role as she did in her dramatic role in Mask.  This really is my all time favorite movie, every time I watch it I feel like I love it more than I did the last time I watched it.",984873600,2,1616,4.170967741935484
823452,5,630428635X,"This is just one of the questions asked and answered in this little gem of a movie. (btw, the answer is ""Maybe because they fear death.""  Both sweet and tart, it has just the right blend of humor, melancholy, and true love.  Cher is at her best here as Loretta Castorini, a widow who falls in love with the younger brother of her fiance, Nicholas Case and Danny Aiello respectively--both equally amazing in these roles.  Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia round out the case as Loretta's parents.  Feodor Chaliapin Jr. is priceless as Loretta's dog-doting grandfather and catch John Mahoney before he became ""Frasier""'s dad.
My favorite scene is the where Loretta first meets Johnny at the bakery.  Nicholas Cage gives the funniest, saddest speech about his past.  I know the whole scene by heart.",982108800,3,799,4.881481481481481
823453,5,630428635X,"Quit bellyachin' about the pan-and-scan format, stick to the story.  If anybody exists who can watch this movie and not fall in love with it, I  hope I never meet them.  Cher is absolutely marvelous in this timeless  comedy about a frumpy widow who is about to re-marry for convenience  instead of love; her intended is an overgrown mama's boy who looks like he  just swallowed a dose of cyanide when he proposes to her.  Off he runs to  Italy to visit his mother on her deathbed; while he's away, Cher meets his  estranged brother who literally and figuratively sweeps her off her feet.  Meanwhile, her dad is going through a delayed midlife crisis and is  cheating on her mother.  (There's a priceless scene when Cher and her  future brother-in-law run into her dad and his mistress at the opera, it's  hard to tell who's the more outraged, Cher or Dad.  Dad: ""You're  engaged!"" Cher: ""and you're married!"") Both messes get  sorted out satisfactorily; Cher's intended decides he can't marry her after  all, leaving her free to marry his brother, for love; and dad drops his  mistress and returns to mom.  It's a delightful romp of a movie and  everybody seems to have a ball acting in it.  Bookending the whole film is  Dean Martin's rendition of ""That's Amore"", making me wonder for  the umpteemth time... what the heck IS pasta fazool?",966556800,3,1339,4.672413793103448

7866447,5,630428635X,"Ever since her incredible debut with Sonny Bono in 1965, Cher has been known to be one of the mos successful female musical acts known to the world. Cher has had a hugely successful career in music; she was well-known with Sonny, but it was her solo career that seemed more successful. But Cher wasn't about to be successful in just the music business; Cher wanted to be successful as an actress as well. Cher has starred in a wide load of movies, such as 'Chastity', where she played the title role, 'Silkwood', where she played Dolly Pelliker, 'Mask', where she played Florence 'Rusty' Dennis, 'Suspect', where she played Kathleen Riley, 'The Witches Of Eastwick', where she played Alexandra Medford, etc. But it was her role as Loretta Castorini in the romantic comedy, 'Moonstruck' that made her another one of today's best actresses.
  Taking place in New York City in 1987, Cher playes Loretta Castorini, a lonely Italian widow, who is longing for her Prince Charming to sweep her up off her legs and get her out of her misery. Loretta goes to dinner with her best friend, Johnny Cammareri (played by Danny Aiello). Johnny surprisingly proposes to Loretta, and she happily accepts. Although Loretta likes Johnny a lot because he is her best friend, she knows for a fact that she does not love him. After dinner, Loretta drives Johnny to the airport, for he is flying to Sicilly to be by the side of his dying mother. Before he boards the plane, Johnny gives Loretta the number to his brother's place, and tells her to invite his brother to the wedding. The two lived their lives without seeing or speaking to each other for five years, due to an accident. Loretta assures Johnny that she'll do so and goes home to tell her mother and father, Rose and Cosmo Castorini (played by Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia). Loretta wakes up the next morning, with a phone call from Johnny, asking if Loretta had called his brother yet. Loretta informs Johnny that she'll do so when she hangs up with Johnny. She calles Johnny's brother, but his brother sounds very bitter about Johnny getting married first. Loretta walks down to where Johnny's brother works. Ronny Cammareri is Johnny's brother and he works in a little bread factory, who is still miserable after losing his hand in a bread chopper. He feels Johnny was responsible since, Ronny was using the chopper to chop up some bread for Johnny. Loretta takes Ronny back to his place and begins to explain the truth to Johnny's misery. But the two wind up sleeping together.
  The next morning, Loretta wakes up the next morning only to find Ronny by her side and flips out. She realizes that what she did was wrong, for she is still engaged to Johnny. But Ronny finds himself having fallen madly in love with Loretta... literally. Ronny invites Loretta to the opera, telling her that he loves her dearly and loves the opera dearly. He then says that if he could be with the woman he loves for one more night and to spend the night with the woman he loves by attending a show he loves dearly, he would promise not to bother Loretta again. Loretta goes to the Met, where she meets up with Ronny. The two sit through the opera, very much enjoying the show. Loretta seemed to have enjoyed very much, until she finds her father with a woman and that woman is not her mother. Ronny and Loretta go back to Ronny's place. Loretta does not want to be unfaithful, since she has been unfaithful to Johnny already once. But she knows that she does not love Johnny, for she is madly in love with Ronny and, for the first time, really sees that Ronny is love with her. Will Loretta leave Johnny for Ronny, or will she stay with Johnny? Watch this classic romantic comedy and you'll find out.",1089936000,,3733,4.6006006006006
7866448,5,630428635X,"Moonstruck has such a wonderful cast: Cher, of course, the inimitable Olympia Dukakis, Nicholas Cage, Vincent Gardenia, Danny Aiello... This film about an Italian-American family pushed up against their own cultural expectations, is touching, satirical, funny, a little sad - and ultimately redemptive.
Cher, a widow, feels compelled to do the right thing and marry an older, stable guy, but the one who really rings her bell is the old guy's ne'er-do-well brother. Her parents, of course, have strong feelings on the subject.
Not to be missed.",1067644800,5,544,5.264367816091954
7866449,5,630428635X,"Moostruck is one of those rare films in which everything--ensemble cast, music, script, cinematography--comes together in a perfect mesh.
The movie is nothing more than it pretends to be: a sweet little comedy. But it combines such a wealth of talent on so many levels that it ends up being a truly special experience
Cher is perfection in this movie. She is a fine actress, and carries off a blend of comedy and pathos in a way that makes the viewer want to shake her and hug her by turns. Cher plays a young widow who lives with her extended Italian-American family in New York. Her day job is not too exciting: she works in a funeral parlor. And by night, she works equally hard to get her middle-aged beau, Johnnie, to marry her. Not for love, mind you--she believes that love died with her deceased husband--but for security.
Of course the plot thickens, to include Johnnie's extremely eclectic but surprisingly sexy younger brother, played to the hilt by Nicolas Cage. The brother, a baker, has lost a hand in a work-related accident, and nurses a longtime grudge against Johnnie, whom he blames for causing the mishap. Cher gets herself involved in the feud--and finds herself swept away in a mad love affair.
The supporting cast is superb. Olivia Dukakis is Cher's acerbic and still-attractive mother, the doyenne of the traditional Italian home. The late Vincent Guardino, a plumber with grandiose delusions about his sexual attractiveness, gives a bravura performance as the father with a wandering eye.
At the end of this unpretentious movie, which makes no claim to philosophical depth, the viewer is left with a big smile and a feeling of warm pleasure. I have viewed this movie countless times, and it never fails to delight me.",1030665600,4,1742,4.829431438127091
7866450,5,630428635X,"You don't get much better than this one.  The music, the casting, the setting...all perfect.  Cher may not have the broadest range of acting abilities but this was perfect for her.  I would never have thought of casting Nick Cage in this role but the two of them set the screen on fire.  Wonderful dialoge too. It was the ""Godfather Lite"".  When he tells her he loves her and she smacks him and says ""snap out of it"" it is a  classic. And the dying mother recovered and Cher says ""there aint no miracles in modern times"" is priceless.
If I could only own 5 movies, this would be one of them!",1029283200,2,591,4.232142857142857
