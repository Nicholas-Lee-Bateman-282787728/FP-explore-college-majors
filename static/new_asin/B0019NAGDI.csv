The original Blu-ray releases of these 3 films all looked terrible. There are newer and better Blu-rays of each of these films, and they now sell for about $8-10 each. This set is a rip off in quality and pricing.

To give you an idea of what you'd be getting, here is my review of the original Robocop Blu-ray, which is included in this set:
----------------
I'm not reviewing the film here - I'm assuming the reader is already familiar with it and likes it (otherwise (s)he would not be reading about the BluRay). Robocop is like a comic book hero/story, and this is one of the very best films that captures a comic book world, IMO.

I picked up the BluRay at FutureShop for $8 and compared it with the DVD I already owned. The audio sounds the same to me as on the DVD. The only special feature is the trailer, same as the DVD. The BluRay does have a bonus that's not on the DVD - 3 trailers for other films. Totally useless! The video does look cleaner and clearer than the DVD... but that does not mean it's GOOD!

This movie needs a serious remastering. It is so inconsistent and so grainy that much of it looks like it was transfered from VHS tapes rather than from master studio film reels. Was the film actually shot so poorly back in 1987? I doubt it.

Overall, this was a missed opportunity for fans of this film. However, If you like the film and don't already own it and find it for less than $10, I'm sure you'll enjoying the BluRay, as it's a better than the DVD.",1456617600,,1632,4.204472843450479

All Classics, in Blu-Ray High Def Quality!",1417219200,,70,5.454545454545454
8274898,1,B0019NAGDI,"Amazon's prices are always changing, but this seems to be a classic example of ridiculous inflation when you should be getting packaged deals for less.  Look at these stats.

Right now on Amazon this bluray deal is still $50 + right now.  I think it's around $54...now why pay $54 when you can buy each single dvd for less?
Believe me, go look, RoboCop and Predator are both $9.99 and Terminator is $8.99.  So you'll be spending $29 instead of $50+, what kind of deal is that? haha, not a deal at all...come on Amazon, you're better than that!",1262217600,4,543,4.454545454545454
8274899,1,B0019NAGDI,"Not really a review (although I think all three movies are excellent!)
However...the ""list price"" for the three pack is $109.94, and the ""sale price"" is $98.99.  If you hop on over to the blu-ray Robocop page, you see the ""three better together"" like(the same three blu-ray titles) you see:

Total List Price: $74.97
Price For All Three: $50.47

So.. shop over there and save $50!  Or buy them individually and still save at least $25 at full MSRP.",1241308800,4,448,4.632911392405063
8274900,4,B0019NAGDI,"Much better than I expected from a #4 evolution of the Rambo series.  Better filming, better acting, good story line.  They didn't need the nudity or rape scenes, which kept this out of reach for younger kids.  Rambo does represent the truth about politics, leaders, soldiers, and citizens.  I can see that a real war hero would have an almost impossible time coming home and coping with normal life.  I mean the type of hero that killed many, saw thousands die, and faced death daily.  Rambo makes you feel the pain, the anger torwards his own country, and the war that rages on in his mind.",1212105600,,592,4.537735849056604
