6162357,2,B00HGJB3MC,"I really was looking forward to a good accurate movie about the battle of Stalingrad. The subtitles weren't translated correctly ,like Das Boot. Personally think it's a waste of time and money.",1393632000,4,193,5.0625
6162358,4,B00HGJB3MC,Movie is ok. Better than many other Russian WWII era movies.  The love story within the battle seems pointless and distracts from the point.,1393286400,3,140,4.833333333333333
6162359,5,B00HGJB3MC,"I was impressed about the humanity portrait in this film.
Soldiers put to the utmost stress as human beings , portrait a wide range of reactions, that viewers will seldom see in combat movies. And that for both sides : Wehrmacht vs Soviet Army.
The German soldiers are being experienced as individuals, struggling with the racial doctrine with whom they have been brainwashed. The Directors idea of  casting professional German actors, playing German officers, really pays off.
The special effects and combat scenes enhanced by CGI are breath taking and awesome.
Message of the film:
Every individual is loosing in War. There is only hardship and tragedy.",1390176000,76,655,5.121495327102804
6162360,3,B00HGJB3MC,"Stalingrad is a battle; I know much about. So this review is by a reviewer who was dissatisfied with its historical details. Stalingrad was after Moscow the biggest battle on the Eastern Front, and it certainly was a very significant one. It was not however, a battle for freedom, on one side was Stalin and the other was Hitler. I doubt under Stalin that a Russian soldier would dare to say some of the things these soldiers say. Having said this clearly the director did pay attention to the way weapons are used in battle.  Clearly, he had access to a decent military adviser. Although the story itself seems to be a loose adaption of the battle at Pavlov's House, Vasily Zaytsev experiences and another scene at the Stalingrad railway station.

The story itself, I found weak. It is really two stories of a German captain who is having an affair with a Russian woman and five Russian soldiers who adopt a Russian woman. I confess this just bored me.

The actor I really liked is Thomas Kretschmann, who seems to be making a career of doing films about Stalingrad. Although I believe some of the others were good too. I think it was a case where the story let them down.

Would I recommend it, well I did to my elders who lived though the war in that area but no-one else. Overall I think it could and should have been a lot better a movie.",1390089600,10,1343,4.425101214574899
6162361,5,B00HGJB3MC,"First, I have seen it in an IMAX cinema which is well worth to do even only for the stunning effect of the Stalingrad surrounding you as sure as hell.

If not, watching it at home is still the second best.

Warning: I have made an effort to make a no-spoilers review but still it contains some hints about the plot, etc.

Pros: a very good actors' work; a true no-sugar but very human portrait of Russian soldiers; a sharp contrast between a gentle 18-year girl and ash and fire around her; the state of the art visual effects; attention to every detail of the Stalingrad's reality, from uniforms to military training of the actors (they move like soldiers and use weapons like soldiers), from weapons to spoons (note: the tanks, of course, are not real German tanks so as it is the case with any WWII movie, the history maniacs are certainly going to ""notice"" this); a majority of the battle scenes is gripping and very realistic (and is based on the real events - including, I must notice, an attack of the burning Russian soldiers at the beginning of the movie).

Cons: the characters of the main heroes are not detailed (which, however, is the director's intentional choice); a love story of a German officer is something plugged in to show ""the other side of the battle""; the German officer himself should have been separated into several people since otherwise he seems to be everywhere; SOME of the battle scenes (like killing a woman) lack, I would say, military (logical?) background. Finally, the story of the Russian defenders of the house is based on the real Pavlov's house defense - which defenders showed equal determination and bravery but even more military skill and repelled literally hundreds of German attacks (with devastating German losses and minimal losses on the side of the defenders). No idea why the reality should be more impressive than the movie.

Overall, Bondarchuk - junior (the film's director) is a good director but still falls a bit short of his great father. I was hesitating between 4 and 5 stars but finally made it 5.",1389657600,72,2060,4.711111111111111

6162377,5,B00HGJB3MC,"I really enjoyed this movie.  Yes, it's a little different than ""Enemy at the Gates"" but as far as WWII movies go, it's a winner.

6162379,1,B00HGJB3MC,"Do yourself a favor. Watch the German masterpiece, ""Stalingrad: Dogs! Do you want to live forever?"" (1959), or the 1993 (director Vilsmaier) Stalingrad instead of this dumbed-down, video-game/Call of Duty style graphics/imagery garbage. Disappointing to put it politely.",1514764800,,270,6.131578947368421
6162380,5,B00HGJB3MC,"As they say, it is a long way to Tipperary....Kretschmann from my understanding never wanted to play Nazis, yet he starred in the German 1992 Stalingrad, and here he is again, in what is has technologically much more impact, but is really the same story, 25 years later, approximately.
This is THE story if you want to understand Russia, Russians, and their passion for Mother Russia. It can be told many ways, with guns at their backs, or with passion and other drama (as with Enemy at the Gates) but it is still a GREAT story that lends itself to the movie genre very well.
Kretschmann has ironically starred in several blockbuster WWII films, and he gets better and better, the supporting cast is excellent, and if you cannot appreciate this film you have no soul or humanity (my opinion).  If you can only watch one Stalingrad film, I might pick the 1992 German version, but this will be more accessible to many viewers and the CG and technical aspects are in fine detail and really lend immediacy to the drama.  Any way, 5 stars.  Any language.",1514505600,,1049,4.598930481283422
6162381,2,B00HGJB3MC,"While production values were high (good FX and battle scenes), the sentimental plot and frankly unrealistic scenario combined to kind of kill the enjoyment.",1512777600,,156,5.541666666666667
6162382,1,B00HGJB3MC,"Literally the absolute worst movie I have ever watched. I would rather be tied down and water boarded while Water World is played over and over again for the rest of my life than watch this terrible film again. In no way it is historically accurate, at one point an artillary shell ricochet off a tank a blew up the whole German front.

The only redeeming moment in this movie was when a German Soldier was about to kill a child and women shouted she is not a Jew shes a child so German did not kill her. I laughed for about 5 minutes about that line.",1510358400,,551,4.149532710280374
6162383,3,B00HGJB3MC,"Set was great and acting quite good, but not necessarily the historic reference I had hoped it would be. The West needs to better understand the battle for Stalingrad, just as they better understood Normany following Saving Private Ryan.

6162395,1,B00HGJB3MC,"I enjoy a good war movie, but, this was very difficult to get into. It seemed like a propaganda movie picting the Russians as super humans with the 300 spartan tactics. A few good special effects, but, that was the best of the movie. Narrating could have been done without. Bad acting, I feel like I've said enough.

6162401,3,B00HGJB3MC,"Stalingrad is a vast subject that is iconic in russian history and in WWII -  a major motion picture would seem to be overdue.  This is not that movie. it really is a soap opera of 5 russian soldiers protecting one russian woman against what seems to be the entire german army.  the special effects are good, the atmosphere appropriately gritty, but if you are looking for a war movie about stalingrad, this is not it.",1491782400,3,418,4.473684210526316

6162403,5,B00HGJB3MC,"The story was a bit ho hum.. I was expecting alot more action in this film, but the 3D was absolutely amazing and worth the price of getting this film. 3D is hit or miss, but this one is definitely a hit",1490832000,2,203,3.857142857142857
6162404,2,B00HGJB3MC,"First off the film is subtitled in English. Be prepared to read the text to the end ((more than two hours). That should have been mentioned somewhere before I bought the movie. Second, this is a Russian slanted propaganda piece designed to make look as though the glorious communist paradise was a more heroic struggle than it actually was. What you glean from this is the fact that communism does not care about the common man. The citizens are a resource that is expendable to ensure that the state survives no matter what the cost. The scene where burning soviet soldiers attack a fortified German position is unbelievable but if all you read is Pravda you might go along with that part. If you want to know what living in a communist country is really like I suggest that you go there to live and work among the peasants. I'm confident you will have a change of heart. If not well then, you have found the paradise you've always been searching for. I did it for a year and you should be able to figure out what my perspective is.    , .",1489968000,,1040,4.40625
6162405,3,B00HGJB3MC,"Somewhat strange movie. After seeing the older Stalingrad (the German version) I expected way more.
The voice over is horrible and even Kretschmann didn`t convince me. Acting is subpar and the story line is ludicrous.
All in all not the worst movie I`ve seen but after flics like ""Das Boot"" and ""Stalingrad"", this one just does not compare. Not even close.",1488758400,2,356,4.852459016393443
6162406,5,B00HGJB3MC,"Great action movie.  Yes, some of the sub plots are a bit out of place for the battle at Stalingrad, but the realism of the battle scenes, use of correct weapons and equipment make this a great war movie.",1487980800,,204,4.230769230769231
6162407,4,B00HGJB3MC,"(1st off I'd like to say there is a cancer in film reviews/critics. that is, the movie isn't what people wanted it to be, I'm not doing that.  I take films as is, and what they are, not what I wished them to be.)  SO!  For example, those who gave it low ratings were probably hoping for a slammed packed action flick.

ACTION 3/5: Though there is lots of cool and great action, it comes in ten minute bursts, every 25 minutes or so.  It has cool slow motion sequences and the imagery looks real with all the green screen and CGI.  It is also not overly gory either, the most intense it gets is Russians on fire running into the trenches.  Lots of good explosions and realistic gunfire.

VISUALS 5/5:  The film is darker toned with blues and greys, gives it the cold feeling.  like I said early, cool slow motion, it is very smooth and the slow mow we like seeing. Not quiet like SHERLOCK HOLMES though.  The planes look weird at times, but everything fits in very well and looks good and fitting to war time.

SOUND 5/5:  The gunshots, bombs, cannons, all sound good.  The voices are clearly heard (I'm learning Russian and could still clearly understand) I also loved how it was real Russian and real German speaking.  It does come with English subtitles.  The music was good too, not much different than other films, I saw someone call it cheesy... not at all.

PLOT 3/5:  Its a simple story that falls in the lines of a 'feel good'.  The basics is they save an 18 yr old girl from the Germans to protect her.  The movie opens up saying ""How can one have 6 fathers?"" then the movie is about the six soldiers that protect her.  That is the main, the back up plot, or second plot, is about a German leader who loves a Russian woman and must take on the six soldiers or be executed by the German army.  As said earlier, the action comes in 10 minute bursts every 25 minutes.  This doesn't mean there is no gun fire in those times, it just means there's not really much action in those times, its the German and the Russian girl and the Russians and the Russian girl trying to stay alive.

OVER ALL 4/5:  It was a clean movie that tied all the connections in a great way.  Told a good story, and stuck to it over just crazed explosions and violence.  (Now to break my rule of 'it wasn't what I wanted it to be"" I do wan this movie to feel more like SABATON'S STALINGRAD music video, but its not, and its ok, it all feels good and fitting.  More action would have been cool, but then again, this movie doesn't over do it.  The other thing I noticed was odd film cutting.  One moment their in the second floor and the next their fighting in the trenches, then without showing them in a clear way, they are somewhere else.  These are minor though.  Still a very good film.    .     !",1486252800,16,2778,4.24904214559387

6162448,3,B00HGJB3MC,"I'm a WWII buff and I REALLY wanted to like this movie.  I tried really hard to like it.  I thought there would be some kind of historical framework or some reinforcement of the historical and brutal nature of this amazing siege and battle.  The real battle resulted in two million dead, captured or missing soldiers and 40,000 dead civilians in a savage battle that raged from July of 1942 until February of 1943.  There was a brilliant counterattack by the Soviet forces that completely turned the tide of the battle.  There was a brutally cold winter for which the Germans were not prepared and supply issues that resulted in frozen and starving soldiers without ammunition fighting for their survival.  There was an incredible amount of disastrous ""leading"" by Hitler that resulted in the total loss of his armies.  None of this was addressed in the movie - it was a ridiculous love story (kind of) between five ""father-figures"" and a younger woman.  The historic nature of this battle was reduced to one building and one public square strewn with rubble.  They could have done so much more.",1467763200,10,1095,4.781914893617022

I cannot believe it has more than three stars as it is truly awful.  While some of the special effects are good, others are stupid beyond comprehension.  For example, the Soviet soldiers continue to run forward and fire their weapons even when on fire.  The story is equally dumb.  The various soldiers fall in love with this woman with few, if any, redeeming qualities.  If one knew nothing about the battle of Stalingrad, this movie might be a bit interesting, but to anybody with any knowledge of history, this movie reminds me of very bad Soviet propaganda.  The German movie of the same name is much, much better, as is Enemy at the Gates.  Essentially, any war movie is better than this one.  It is, without a doubt, the worst war movie I have ever seen.

We have themes of forbidden love, with the German officer falling in love with the Russian girl, who is summarily executed for being a Russian whore, and the beautiful Katya, who all the Russians want to bang, hence the five fathers reference.  The dominant theme is the Russians who outsmart the Germans at every turn, but the Germans are forbidden from doing the same, all wrapped up in a tone of doom, gloom, and burning embers falling from the air, and instant death.
Just one in a million Stalingrad moments, that will go on forever, until humans realize that the true fire that fuels warfare, is human genetics, whereby the dominate gene rises to the top.

So my interest was piqued by a reviewer who said it was the best  3d movie ever made.  I'm afraid, in my humble opinion, that it isn't.  The film seems dark even by 3d standards which seem to darken a lot compared to 2d versions and the story is rather hard to follow with a lot of actors following a lot of plot lines.

Likewise the envelope story of Russian Aid worked helping earthquake victims is unnecessary and confusion.  Company 9 was ever so much better.  Enemy at the Gates is a better film about Stalingrad, as is the eponymous German film.  Soviet era films about Stalingrad have their own issues, although a few are good.  In any case, this film is of varied quality, and I have to say I'm sorry I bought it for 14.99.",1440806400,2,588,4.605769230769231
6162517,5,B00HGJB3MC,"Yes it's true you have to read subtitles while watching Stalingrad, but there's a ton of emotion between all the characters involved so it's not a hassle or disappointment to spend time reading.  You really get to feel what these soldiers are going through in the heat of battle during World War II.  For the most part the movie takes place in one location- the Russians stay in one building, and across the street the Germans are in another area.  Gradually the Germans force their way through so it's up to the Russians to guard their area and stop them.  The movie mostly focuses on the Russian side of World War II, or rather, 60% Russian/40% German.

You eventually learn to care about all the characters due to the drama increasing as the movie goes along.  Maria Smolnikova is the female the Russian soldiers try to protect, and she has her own horrific story to share concerning the tragedies she had to endure with her family.  Meanwhile on the German side you have the beautiful Yanina Studilina who's a Russian on the German side because she really likes German soldier Thomas Kretschmann.  Turns out Thomas desires to protect her as much as he possibly can despite his own troop thinking he's a traitor for being with her.  He doesn't let the war stand between love, so yeah, expect a little romance and drama mixed in with the gruesome battle taking place in the streets.  And the story of the woman/mother who wouldn't leave her apartment room no matter what despite the deterioration of the building because of the bombings taking place all around... very sad.

Meanwhile Dmitriy Lynenkov has revenge and anger on his mind with his loose trigger and constant lookout in the upstairs building window of the German army across the street, and Petr Fedorov is the more rational one on the Russian side.  We're supposed to cheer for the Russians since it's World War II after all.  It's all about surviving a battle that took place in 1942.  Highly recommended that you watch this movie.  It does everything right, and the special effects, while Hollywood-ish, are splendid and up there in presentation with the best war films you've ever watched.  You're probably wondering how one location can say and reveal so much between two countries battling each other but somehow it works really well.",1440460800,5,2305,4.768261964735516

There is a lot to dislike about this release and movie itself but if you are a fan of war movies, it's worth a watch.

6162539,2,B00HGJB3MC,"Okay...first of all, let me start off by saying that there is a LOT of ""Russian revisionist history"" in this movie.  And, if this was a movie made in the 1930s-1950s, I could buy it a little bit easier.  Coming in 2014....all I can say is ""wow"".  The fact that the narrator goes on to say how much a part of ""freedom"" the Russian Army was in defeating the Nazis in this key battle is almost laughable.  Freedom?  From Stalin's Russia?  Maybe everybody in Russia forgets the fact that he killed more Russians during his reign of terror than the Nazis did!  Or, do these guys forget that Russia basically enslaved all of Eastern Europe for the better part of 50 years before the Wall came down?

And talk about ""propaganda""....the director makes the Russians look like Supermen in this movie:  Close to the beginning of the movie, there is a scene where the Russian troops are trying to capture a fuel depot, which is subsequently destroyed by the Germans.  The Russians come out of the fire, charging the German lines while they are basically human torches, and they overrun the German lines.  Total B.S., if I've ever seen it.  Perhaps the director should have read some real history about the battle of Stalingrad, where many of the Siberian troops sent in as cannon fodder by Stalin, were forced to enter combat without even being issue rifles and were told to grab the rifle of a fallen comrade.  Or the fact that many of the Russians were forced at gunpoint at their BACKS by Russian field Commissars....it was either charge the German lines, or be shot by a card carrying member of the Communist Party!

If you want to watch a good drama about Stalingrad, I recommend renting/buying the GERMAN version of the battle, a movie by the same name:  Stalingrad.  In that movie, you at least see the misery of war as viewed from the German perspective:  Left to basically die in a hopeless battle, slowly freezing and starving to death, with little/no ammunition, all because Hitler would not order the attempted break-out requested by Field Marshal Paulus.

Good action sequences (although again, 1-2 Russians end up taking out squads of their German counterparts), but there are far better war movies out there, if that is what you seek.

I guess Putin must have ordered this film to be made in the wake of all the ""bad"" press the Russians are currently getting for their abuses in the Ukraine.  Because it sure did feel like a propaganda film!",1430697600,,2444,4.652680652680653

If you want to watch a movie that fairly accurately depicts the battle, the hardships, etc, watch the 1993 version .Avoid Enemy at the Gates,  the movie.

6162573,4,B00HGJB3MC,"One might think they were watching the wrong movie when this first begins.  I know I had to double check to ensure I hadn't queued up the wrong one.

The story is told by the son of one resident survivor if the Battle for Stalingrad.  Russian is dubbed into English and German is spoken in German.  Subtitles DEFINITELY help although what is subtitled is not necessarily what was spoken.

Five Russian serviceman, four soldiers and one sailor are located in one of the many ruined multifloored buildings.  One lone woman, the only survivor of the building remains.  Eventually the soldiers (sailor included for brevity's sake) befriend the young woman.

On the other side of the town square and war are the encamped German soldiers.  One Captain has taken up with a Russian girl.  Although neither can understand each other's speech, they manage to carry on for some time.  The Captain's boss, a Colonel, wants the Captain to (1) take the building where the Russians are and (2) have the Captain get rid of the Russian girl.  Any action is only secondary to the drama with the exception of the German tanks which play a pivotal role in the movie.

This movie can sometimes be difficult to follow due to the conflicting between the dubbing and subtitles.  Regardless of which language is being spoken, there is a love story happening in each side of the line.",1422403200,,1358,4.723404255319149

It compares very well to the German version of the same title, although it does go a little overboard in a couple of spots displaying the heroic character of the common Russian soldier.  Of course in those days they were Soviets.  While not trying to depict any true events, the feel of the circumstances and violent nature of battle is on display.  Using what amounts to a squad of soldiers remaining following a charge against a German strong point, they are hold up in a single building forced to defend against numerous attacks and long odds.

6162593,5,B00HGJB3MC,"There are a number of films about the Battle of Stalingrad.  The succession of films are not redundant.  Each one appears to bring
out a true feature that the time frame allows for.  It is historic fact that many civilians did not leave Stalingrad, but remained in their
homes or resident apartments during the battle of Stalingrad.  This DVD film is a superb representation of the civilian Russians who
endured the tragic siege and survived.  The producers and actors in this movie are Russian, German and other Eastern Europe nationalities who give a true-to-life experience of what really happened tragically among the Russian Army, the German Wehrmacht and the Russians civilians.  I felt like I was really there.  I have found this DVD movie a very valuable addition to my collection of military DVDs. I was a former Officer in the USAF, participated in the Air Command & Staff College courses, and can assert the factual circumstances of Stalingrad come alive in this DVD.  For the Russians it was a pyrrhic victory - the cost was very, very high.  For the Germans, it was the beginning of the end.  From May 1941 to the end of the War in April-May 1945, the
German Army lost 60,000 personnel per month on the Eastern Front.  This DVD movie is an excellent illustration of those tragic
historic facts.",1417996800,21,1307,4.764444444444444
6162594,3,B00HGJB3MC,"Action scenes were superb!  The English overdubbing  never should have been added.  Hearing the German soldiers speak in German added to the realism.  Some of the overdubbed voices sounded like one of my computer war games--Panzers Phase 1.

Also, the romance was a bit much, especially for an epic battle such as Stalingrad (same thing holds true for Enemy at the Gate).  Too bad the German Stalingrad version 1992 was not made as realistic as this latest version.  One last negative--German Tanks--Mark IV were placed on T-54/55s.  Being a war buff, that sort of spoiled the realism, but I let it slide.",1417305600,,605,4.862745098039215
6162595,4,B00HGJB3MC,"Overall, very good.  Although ""Enemy at the Gates"" probably sets the standard for this genre, and even though this movie lacks in some important ways to EATG, it is nevertheless a very good counterpart.  Consider especially that this movie is a Russian production and was made for roughly 1/3 the cost of the 2001 EATG (inflation adjusted).

Yes, it overplays the heroic motivations of the Russians and villainy of the Germans.  But this is Russia's turn to tell the story.

Yes, the tanks are clearly not German. But overall, most of the historical details are credible, if not totally accurate.

Fortunately, this was not the case.  The narrator for parts of the action stated:  ""I have Five Fathers"".  The film explains it all and more.  The movie is surprisingly propaganda-free.  Some Germans are pictured humanely, as I am sure there were many.  The protagonists, the five or so soldiers holed up in an apartment block with its back to the Volga River are portrayed in a realistic manner--note I don't speak Russian, so the DVD was watched with English language subtitles.  The lives and characters of the five are dealt with serially in a way which does not compromise the action.  The woman, who lived in the apartment before and during the battle is well-portrayed as a strong, independent, yet sensitive person.  This is quite a feat to combine those qualities well but it was well performed, forming the keystone of the story.  There is plenty of action for those who want a good blood and guts war story.  But more importantly, the emotionality displayed, with composure and commitment by the soldiers and the woman makes its point.  These people, soldiers and civilians were doing what they had to do.  Their heroism is manifested in their unblinking persistence to their beliefs in face of unspeakable horror.  Regardless of your orientation politically or culturally, this movie is a must see.  No there is no glory in war--but there is humanity and heroism.",1413763200,,1619,4.897058823529412

It was fought and won by the common Soviet foot soldier. The encounter depicted is very roughly the one fought by Sgt. Pavlov and his group, a prolonged defense of a strategically situated building, the success of which was critical in the eventual Soviet victory over the Nazi army of Hitler's ""Third Reich"", the actions by the command and individual soldiers of which directly resulted in the deaths of 27 million Soviet citizens. So protestations by other reviewers here to previous films depiction of ""blood thirsty"" Germans are ironic and ludicrous. What were they if not blood thirsty? The characters are very obviously composites and the plot allegorical. Using these means of presenting the story was 100% successful. References to commissars and other ideological tropes by the obviously U.S. and other Anglo reviewers here are simply jealousy and unease that this communist system mustered the wherewithal to overcome its mistakes, summon its will and apply its resources to grind up the German army and save the western allied armies and people from millions of deaths on their side and world from Nazism.

6162625,2,B00HGJB3MC,"From the war-is-hell department comes Stalingrad, an old-fashioned World War II movie chronicling the famous siege that devastated that city in 1942 and 1943. This dubbed-into-English Russian film tells of five heroic Soviet fighters who commandeer a shell-shocked womans apartment out of which they wage their own battle against the Nazis.

With its clear-cut delineation between good guys and bad guys, heroes and villains (except for one momentarily ambiguous Nazi), its clear that subtlety is not exactly the movies strong suit. In addition, its complete lack of character development turns the viewers into dispassionate observers of all the brutality and carnage taking place on screen.

Running an overlong 2 hours and 10 minutes, this static and talky and occasionally corny movie seems designed to provide modern-day Russians with a morale boost by giving them a chance to focus on their heroic past. And while the Russians have just as much of a right to engage in this sort of self-congratulatory exercise as anyone else (goodness knows, American moviemakers do it often enough), it still doesnt make for very compelling filmmaking or drama.

PROS:
A lot of action

Historical makes me feel like I am in the battle.

CONS
So there will be a lot of cons because this movie basically is not good.

1. Only has a 18-22 year old girls opinion, really? I wanted opinions from both sides.
2. Germans deporting Jews, this is a false claim, there was NEVER a order to deport Jews. epic fail.
3.  Makes soviet barbarians look like heroes, really? Come on! How about the germans?
4. Only focuses on one squad, god. How about focus on an german unit too?
5. Nothing like the other movies.

Overall: I regret renting this trash from redbox, what I wanted to see was the film focusing on both sides, not a whiny girl and a annoying squad. I would give this 0 stars.",1407110400,2,825,4.256410256410256

I ordered it because I respect how people fought in World War II, and the trailer makes it look like a non-stop action film, but it is not. It has some pretty depressing scenes, but they relate on how people were treated during the war; However, it is not as good as ""Saving Private Ryan.""

6162654,5,B00HGJB3MC,"I beg you...please watch this film with its original Russian language soundtrack with English subtitles...not dubbed in English. Dubbed in English turns a stunning film into a preposterous one. I would guess that many of the negative reviewers would have left positive ones had they watched with the Russian soundtrack. Yes, the English-speaking ""actors"" who dubbed the film were abysmal, but don't blame the actual actors or the filmmakers. I'm sure the dubbing was done on the cheap and the director had no say, Russian or English, in the matter.

In Russian, the film is well written and directed. The skirmish scenes are totally original. I've never seen anything even close to this in many Hollywood movies. The scene of Russian soldiers attacking while on fire is harrowing. In 3D, the scene is one of the most horrific I've ever experienced

For those who worry that the subtitles might be hard to read in 3D, no need to. I had no problems at all. They also don't distract or detract from the 3D experience. In fact, I hardly noticed them after a few minutes. Stalingrad is an action oriented movie anyway, so there's not a lot of dialogue to read..

Stalingrad doesn't attempt an overview of the entire siege. It narrows the focus down to a group of determined Russian soldiers and we view the battle through their eyes. It's riveting.

6162660,3,B00HGJB3MC,"With the scope of a big battle, it's impossible to cover all angles. War movies usually end up portraying the story of a platoon or small unit, and this one is no different. This one is not trying to be a documentary, it's human interest set in the backdrop of this big battle. While the negative reviewers do have a point, just about everything shown in this movie actually happened. The basic premise is the defense of an apartment building in a key location by a small unit, well, this happened at the famous ""Pavlov's House"". At least one Russian made himself into a human torch to take out a tank, and there was at least one case of Russian women running a bordello servicing German customers. And over 1,000 civilians lived in and around the fighting. There were some love affairs, etc. A famous musician did come around to play for the troops, and the Germans even asked for an encore. I do have my doubts about bouncing the artillery shell around a corner, but, what the hey. Sometimes with movies we have to suspend our disbelief for dramatic purposes. This director is a little melodramatic for my taste, but this was made for the Russian film viewer, so maybe it's just right. I didn't particularly like the device for telling the story as a flashback, to a present day girl who was stuck under some rubble (I thought I had received the wrong movie on the DVD, I couldn't grasp what the Japanese could possibly have to do with Stalingrad) but this irony, and the poetic device of the guy having five fathers, does remind me of some Russian fairy tales I read as a kid. You have to please your audience, I think that's what the director was doing. As an aside, I bought the Korean movie ""Tae Guk Gi"" which is also over the top with melodrama, but one reviewer, a Korean, mentioned that this was just exactly what Korean people want and expect. So keep an open mind and go with it. With this movie, you finally get to see the Russian point of view, with Russian actors, not all Brits as in ""Enemy at the Gates"". This one emphasizes the house-to-house fighting as opposed to the sniper duel, which was the meat and potatoes of the fighting at Stalingrad. The CGI was good, better than I expected it would be, the Stukas more realistic than in ""Enemy at the Gates"". Most of the explosions were overdone, but that's modern film-making, along with the stop-and-start slow motion, fast motion BS I first saw in ""Behind Enemy Lines"" (others are mentioning the film ""300"" as an example, I'll have to take their word for it). The music is also overly dramatic, but better than sticking some rap percussion in there. So I think this version has its place, just watch it and enjoy it. By the way if you want a mistake, here's one: a German reminisces about the time he met Field Marshal von Paulus, well, Paulus wasn't made a field marshal until a day or two before Stalingrad's surrender, which was still two months in the future. Another anomaly, at the end, they extricate the present day girl from the rubble where she was trapped while listening to this story, well she just dusts herself off and walks out to find the man who talked to her all day, with throngs of EMS workers all around. That must be one tough broad, anywhere else she would be brought out on a stretcher, be given oxygen and IV fluids, and perhaps weakly shake his hand, instead she trots around asking for him and finally finds him in a car about to leave the scene. Whatever, just take the bad with the good, there's plenty of good here, but then I'm biased, I love the Stalingrad story.",1405814400,,3563,4.474654377880184

The characters, an ad hoc collection of various Soviet forces holding a building.  Behind them is the Volga, across the square from them are the Germans determined to push them into the river.  Basically this film is about a small group of Soviet soldiers with a ""hold at all cost"" order against an implacable foe.  On the other side is a weary, exhausted German captain who is seeking solace and companionship with a lovely local.  In the house with the Russians there is a different lovely local who stubbornly refuses to leave her home and all its memories.

6162668,5,B00HGJB3MC,"Stalingrad, this latest movie with that name, takes place in October/November 1942--before the Soviet counter-offensive began on 19 Nov 42.

While there are a few historical inaccuracies, they are trivial ones:

1. During one of his soliloquies, the German Captain refers to Paulus (the Sixth Army's commanding General) as Field Marshal. In fact, Paulus was not promoted to Field Marshal until 31 Jan 1943--the very day that he surrendered the Sixth Army;

2. The cross-strap on the German Colonel's uniform was out of place, and was more appropriate to certain Red Army officers, or the old Nazi SA.

I may be incorrect about item two above, which reinforces my point about the triviality of historical detail lapses.

The savagery and mercilessness of the fighting at Stalingrad, along with the setting, is well-conveyed in its realism to the point of our imagining its place as somewhere in an unnamed area of Dante's Inferno.

As prisoners of this netherworld, it's all the more remarkable, that both German and Soviet antagonists in this movie--and in the actual events on the Eastern Front--could discover or allow to re-emerge, any sense of humanity. This film is an artistic tribute to the power and beauty of our humanity.",1405209600,2,1231,5.069306930693069
6162669,3,B00HGJB3MC,"This is Russia's entry to the 2014 Academy Awards for best Foreign language film. Problem is the version I saw was dubbed into American. I know there have been issues with the huge sub titles that did not necessarily match the dialogue, but I would always prefer to watch in the original language - which I have now found out was an option but I could not sit through this again. The Germans all speak German so that bit was alright.

Anyway the movie tells the story of a band of Russian soldiers and navy who have to defend a strategically important house in the centre of Stalingrad to protect the Volga crossing. [If only the Germans had brought some planes they could have flown over!] Still never mind, and in this house is Katya who they are all smitten with. They are up against a German of ambiguous disposition, Kahn, who could be a good German or a crazed rapist and xenophobe, the debate is a bit wide open.

We have a number of battles and fighting scenes, which are mostly done in slow motion and with some bizarre camera angles, which are there I suspect, as this was also shot in 3 D so has to have the pizzazz factor for the pop corn addicts. It has very little to do with the actual battle of Stalingrad and the story line could be placed in a fair number of other locations. The action was done very well and the CGI money was generally well spent. The acting is hard to gauge because of the awful dubbing.

There is a lot of pointless dialogue too that seems to act as padding. The soldiers being afire and attacking the Germans at the beginning was a bit of a stretch and set my mind against the film from that point. There was a lot of cash spent on this and yet the overall accomplishment is somewhat flat. It comes across as a bit propaganda filled too but is so unconvincing that it doesn't matter. The German film from 1993 also called `Stalingrad' is a much better watch.

Each Russian seemed to have a bizarre story behind him. I guess they wanted to blow us away with the weirdness of each story. I wasn't very impressed with the ""300"" style of slow motion, speed up as Russians killed Germans with knives and then the Germans would go flying through the air with some blood splatter. A few cool explosions, though and the scene of burning Russians was pretty memorable. It was a decent tribute to the suffering of Stalingrad, but I had to give it two stars.

It was exceptionally disappointing to discover the big story of the battle of Stalingrad, rated the most decisive Allied victory in the war, to be reduced to a love story concerning a tiny pct. of the actual forces.

The sets, the magnificently-detailed sets, and the meticulously-constructed buildings, backdrops, along with the horrific action sequences made this a truly stunning experience for me.  But, it won't probably won't be fully appreciated by a lot of viewers.  Why?

Really, you need to be able to understand Russian and German to appreciate the ""blood"" that courses through the well-made ""body"" of this movie.  The English-spoken version of the soundtrack was so ""21st-Century"" in its delivery, cadence, and intonation that I couldn't stand it for more than about fifteen minutes.  I am conversant in German, so at least I could appreciate that portion of the dialogue, and, in my opinion, the German-speaking actors all were very good.  I'll take it ""on faith"" that the Russian-speaking actors were also very good -- indeed, they seemed to be.

Some complain that the pace of the movie was uneven and quite slow at times.  Ever been in a war?  That is exactly what a real war IS like.  Long periods of nothing but your own worries, doubts, and fears, interrupted by frighteningly fast, hair-raising action that means life-and-death.  Then... back to tedium, monotony, and even boredom.  One of the strengths of ""Stalingrad"" is that it accurately portrays the lulls, the savage, horrific action, AND -- the effects of both of these things on the minds of the people in these two ""Band of Brothers"" groups -- Russian, and German.

Because it was ""Stalingrad"" from a Russian point of view, I think I expected it to be almost too slanted and biased to watch, but I was wrong.  Yes, the full horrors of war are quite evident, but both sides in this greatest conflict of WWII are, I believe, fairly accurately portrayed.  Director Fedor Bondarchuk produced a really fine movie, lovingly put-together without slavish reliance on CG effect on a computer, and I hope you enjoy it -- especially if you speak Russian and German.",1404000000,2,1930,4.965732087227415

I was deeply impressed by the scale of the film and the battle scenes.
I was disappointed to discover that the dialogue is obviously dubbed in English and not very well done.
This movie gives a good insight into the way the Russians view the heroic desperate defense of Stalingrad. The Russians are portrayed a stoic patriotic defenders of the motherland. The Germans are shown to be incompetent savage fighters who are poorly led. Only one German officer has a soul but he corrupts a Russian girl who is sadly executed by Russian soldiers for collaboration even though she was an unwilling victim.

I particularly enjoyed hearing the word ""Coward"" being interpreted over & over within the subtitles as ""Sissy.""  Sadly, this is one of the high points of the entertainment therein this release of ""Stalingrad.""

Most folks watching this show, ...having interest in such movies; are going to be relatively familiar with the circumstances of the uniqueness of the battle of Stalingrad, and the inhabitants of the city.  Von Paulus, and the Sixth army get isolated from the Wehrmacht, and essentially freeze, or starve to death while desperately fighting valiant, terrified Soviet troops in ever increasing numbers thus heralding the coming German collapse in WWII.  Between eighty to one hundred thousand German solders are forced into horrible gulags in exotic places such as Siberia upon the surrender of the recently promoted field marshal ultimately.

Forget all that!  The plotline here ain't got nothing to do with Von Paulus, Zhukov, Konev, Goebbels' propaganda, Goering's Luftwaffe, Hitler, or even Stalin.  This show is about ""love"", and social drama with the need of a reasonably studied viewer relying upon his knowledge of the harshness of WWII urban battle scenarios, and the circumstances of forced relationships between ""captured"" women, and enemy officers.  Actually, I thought the most interesting part of the movie involved the German Hauptmann & the Slavic beauty he had obviously commandeered.  The actor portraying the German captain is the same guy that I saw in another similar movie, but ain't sure which one (maybe ""The Pianist"", or ""Dresden"")  He, and the Ukrainian lady were both interesting, and obviously good veteran performers.

If you have a Blu-ray version, and good surround sound, ""alien"" technology in your movie room; you will find all the latest directorial techniques currently used in similar WWII movies in evidence the last few years.  Airplane crashes, digital enhancements, constant battle/boom ambience throughout the presentation, etc. But, that's about it with this show.

The whole thing starts out during the 2004 Tsunami event in Thailand(?), and then recedes into the memory of a Ukrainian rescuer toward his father's war experience in Stalingrad.  It never gets there really.  This whole show could very easily, and probably would have been better set in another Soviet city of conflict, such as Kiev, Leningrad, or Minsk.  Using the well-known city of Stalingrad as the movie's title was just probably an effort to get more attention to the show since it had been the setting of ""Enemy at the Gates.""

RENT this movie, don't buy it!  ANY five minutes of the masterpiece ""Lone Survivor"" currently out there would probably please anyone interested in this kind of subject matter more than the ""Stalingrad Tales of Romance"" found in this DVD!  Your probably not going to watch this movie repeatedly as you would ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Katyn"", or ""Lone Survivor."" I also recommend ""Woman in Berlin"", - IF you READ the book first!

6162686,1,B00HGJB3MC,"Being an avid, albeit, amateur historian & having read historical accounts, official battle reports, & correspondence from regular soldiers I expected much, much more from this film.  Instead of portraying the battle which was dramatic enough this retelling attempts to connect present w/past through such an incredibly convoluted transition that I, as others, wondered if either I or Amazon had erred in movie selection.

Then the battle itself... we've got the five fathers in a building in Stalingrad that also houses the woman, all five men have an affair with.  It is important to remind the casual observer the Uncle Joe Stalin decided not to allow the inhabitants of Stalingrad to evacuate rationalizing instead that Soviet forces would fight harder w/innocent civilians caught in the middle of the battle.

Then there are the thoughtful, humane idealists in this squad who get angry when a Soviet soldier shoots a German soldier while the latter is getting a drink of water.  You have the fiercely motivated, patriotic Soviet soldiers burning from head to toe yet rushing the enemy lines determined to kill the invaders before dying, right.  B/c people whose flesh is burning from head to toe aren't consumed w/escaping the flames rather following orders until dead...

Then we have the combat training of the squad which operating like a seasoned, cohesive fire team adept at close quarters combat as opposed to conscripts.

Then there's the German's... evil, many times referring to pushing their territorial conquest all the way to India?  Now this was the 1st I'd ever heard of Wehrmacht soldiers casually discussing a push all the way to India.

This movie involved nothing of the greater battle for Stalingrad, how the Soviets successfully attacked Romanian & Italian troops guarding severely overextended supply lines thus cutting off the Wehrmacht, trapping it & starving it to death in Stalingrad until it capitulated thus of the ~285,000 soldiers in the 6th Army, ~ 91,000 surrendered to Soviet forces.  They were paraded through Moscow & into the Gulags.  Of the original 300K men in 6th Army only ~ 5,000 returned home & many of those 5-10 years or more after wars end.

The Stalingrad defeat was magnified for the Axis powers defeat a few months later in North Africa when roughly a similar size force (285,000 German & Italian soldiers) were taken into captivity.

Stalingrad has often been referred to as the most severely battle damaged city of WWII, however, I would suggest Leningrad, Warsaw, Rotterdam, Berlin, Dresden, Manilla, Tokyo & countless other Japanese cities as well as Nanking & countless Chinese cities.  However the two most damaged cities of the war are widely regarded as Warsaw & Manilla.

Additionally, the Soviets benefited from having a single front, albeit a large one.  Many a Russian has suggested they could have defeated Germany alone but I wonder when Germany's war making capacity was bombed night & day w/o regard for allied life from ~ '42 until wars end.  Additionally, the bombing campaign alone drew much of the Luftwaffe back from the eastern front to protect Germany's war making capacity.  Additionally, there were the constant flow of supplies from the US into the Soviet Union.

Indeed, the Soviet Union ought to be grateful Winston Churchill refused to ""make a deal"" w/the Hitler & that European Axis forces & Japanese ones never acted cohesively or the USSR would have fought a two front war.  If the Nazi forces had allied w/the Ukraine instead of subjugating them, the Eastern Front of the European Theatre of WWII or the USSr's ""Great Patriotic War"" may well have gone differently.

Anyway, I'm baffled at the good ratings this movie has received from either a historical perspective or purely an entertaining one.  I think perhaps Russians are just touchy ;-)

6162688,5,B00HGJB3MC,"This is a Russian film of the Great Patriotic War. There is a strong undercurrent of Russian conservative viewpoint. It is almost Stalinist, which is appropriate for the time and place, but a little scary for current events. The story is some spin doctoring of an actual incident during the battle for Stalingrad. All the major character's are very well portrayed by a talented cast. These are very Russian characters, so don't expect to see the hollyweird stereotypes you normally get and expect in a war movie. There are a couple of combat scenes here that hollyweird could learn a few things from. One of which will haunt me for years to come. The only flaws were why not tell the true story?

This movie is a cross between ""300"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" , some effects from ""The Matrix"" tossed in, with none of the story of any.  Basically, it's about a group of Soviet soldiers who keep a house from falling into the German's hands.  This house is next to the Volga river so it's of strategic importance; the Russian can keep a beachhead in Stalingrad.

I have sympathy for the Russians but they come across as brutes.  The Germans seem too old for the job; the actor who is a company commander is pushing over 40.  The old move&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enemy-At-The-Gates/dp/B0035JPVXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enemy At The Gates</a>&nbsp;does a far better job of showing both sides fighting and interaction with the civilians.

The story is narrated by the grown child of a woman from the house that is the center of the fighting.  He tells his story to a German woman trapped in the wreckage of an earthquake struck house in China or Japan.  It is the story of a woman saved by a group of Soviet soldiers and how they keep open a path for the Russian forces to reenforce Stalingrad.

This movie is a Russian attempt at modern movie making.  It just can't make it for any educated viewer.  The older Soviet propaganda movies are better, modern slow motion computer effects don't add to the script, and the cardboard German bad guys act like they are refugees from some anti-military American Vietnam movie.

6162695,4,B00HGJB3MC,"I'm not sure U.S. residents can fully understand the horror that defines the Battle of Stalingrad, an unthinkable slaughter between Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Survivors-of-Stalingrad-Eyewitness-Accounts-from-the-6th-Army-1942-1943/dp/1848327668/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Survivors of Stalingrad: Eyewitness Accounts from the 6th Army, 1942-1943</a>). More than one million people were killed. For an idea to this staggering total, and it ranks as the bloodiest battle in human history, the combined U.S. casualties in World War II were not even half that number. It was an historic victory, turning the tide of the war against Nazi Germany.

The Soviet Union's entertaining 2013 film ""Stalingrad,"" one of the most successful blockbusters in the country's history, is a well-made perspective of five Russian soldiers holding a building in the bombed rubble of Stalingrad. Within the structure they discover teenage civilian Katya (Maria Smolnikova), and vow to protect her from the evils of battle. It's a poetic, if not maudlin work, as the hardened soldiers provide gifts, fall in love and present her an impromptu birthday party.

Their actions are contrasted with disillusioned Nazi commander Kahn (Thomas Kretschmann, the film's only actor known to U.S. audiences). He is ordered to take the building in a series of assaults. Kahn is also obsessed with a local Russian woman Masha (Yanina Studilina), a blonde beauty ostracized by neighboring residents for ""sleeping with the enemy.""

If ""Stalingrad"" is not epic in scope, there are some extraordinary battle scenes aided by IMAX 3D technology, the first Russian film to be produced in the format. An opening encounter where burning Russian soldiers charge the German lines is stunning. Perhaps implausible, it is an unforgettable symbol of the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of soldiers in this deadliest of battles.

Some of the greatest anti-war films ever made have come from Russia, with the most harrowing being the 1985 classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Come-and-See/dp/B002O6G9BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Come and See</a>.

These films lack the glorified heroism seen in U.S. works, refusing to pander to audiences conditioned by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Hell-and-Back/dp/B0001FVDH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Hell and Back</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Longest-Day/dp/B00005PJ8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Longest Day</a>&nbsp;and more recently&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan-HD/dp/B00DQJPRSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan [HD</a>]. So it is puzzling that while ""Stalingrad"" is undoubtedly Russian, it has the feel of a gigantic James Cameron production, replete with slow motion fights, acrobatic stunts and a rousing musical score.

I suppose Russian audiences deserve their heroes as much as Americans, and director Fedor Bondarchuk, along with writers Ilya Tilkin and Sergey Snezhkin, have pulled out every gimmick known to our country's summer epics. They did their homework and were rewarded handsomely as Russian audiences turned out in droves.

I couldn't help but feel a peculiar sense of deja vu. There's Tom Hanks' brooding, Tom Sizemore's burly decency, Matt Damon's boyish enthusiasm and Giovanni Ribisi's geeky wisecracks. Of course, none of these actors are in the film, with Russian thespians Pyotr Fyodorov, Andrey Smolyakov, Aleksey Barabash and Dmitriy Lysenkov standing in. All of these men deliver fine performances, with Fyodorov especially displaying a sturdy presence akin to Russell Crowe or Bruce Willis.

The wanton killing I accepted, as the reality was far worse than can ever be shown on screen. But I was disturbed by a slow-motion rape scene with no consequences to the perpetrator. For the women to fall in love with him afterwards was irresponsible, to say the least. And the scene where they profess their love, reminiscent of the epic works of David Lean, was uncomfortable considering the forced consummation.

I've been spoiled by the dark fatality of Russian films, if not literature. The price this great army had to pay to repel the Nazi menace from their soil was unfathomable. For an idea, recall our own traumatized revulsion on Sept. 11, 2001 when terrorists attacked the World Trade Center. We lost 3,000 souls that horrible day. In World War II, the Soviet Union lost 20 million defending their land. So while their memories of this war are so much different from ours, for them to produce an Americanized version of events is almost incongruous.

We need to keep in mind this is a Russian movie made by Russians. They have a very different view of the war than the rest of us. they lost more people than any other single nation and even call it the Great Patriotic War.

Is this a great movie about the whole battle for Stalingrad? No. First of all, no single movie could cover the enormity of that battle. In the same way that no movie can adequately cover D-Day or Market Garden. These events covered far too much time and distance and involved thousands upon thousands of men. All any one movie can do is pick the part it wants to show and go from there. Das Boot, a five star war movie if there ever was one, is about one submarine, not the whole battle for the Atlantic.

Now, did I find this movie overall to be particularly realistic? That depends. I found the fighting scenes to be very well done. Lack of supply lines of course lead to equipment shortages and the bombed out city was very well portrayed. And, as many have suggested reading books on the subject, you will find that much of the battle was indeed house to house and building to building sometimes with Germans controlling one floor and the Russians another floor of the same building. Urban warfare is not so simple as some reviews have suggested. So the ""war"" part of this movie, in my view, is excellent.

Other reviewers have noted how Katya is a stand in for Mother Russia and this symbolism is heavy handed. I am not so sure. While I found the love story between Katya and Sissy (Sergey) to be a bit much, I think men in that situation, fighting a battle of their nation's leader's egos writ large, are going to look for anything they can feel good about fighting for. Would any man be inclined to fight for a country whose leaders are more willing to kill him than the enemy he faces? There will be some true believers, of course, but like most wars, it involves regular people thrown into horrible circumstances. I think this movie did an excellent job showing the difference between Russian soldiers and German or American or British soldiers. The Germans, Americans and British all had hope of going home. The Russians had two choices, die in battle or be killed by their own officers. they knew their job was to die and take as many Germans as possible with them. They knew they were not going home. They had no hope. But by adopting Katya, they at least felt they gave their own deaths some meaning.

But after a second viewing, I find the German Captain Kahn's story to be the most compelling. He has been turned into a monster and hates himself. By clinging to Masha he is desperately trying to cling to his humanity that so many have lost in the war and this battle in particular. His personal battle is just as lost as Stalingrad, he just can't see it.

I find the reviews dismissing this as just propaganda problematic at best. At least some have acknowledged that Hollywood churned out its fair share of propaganda. I can name at least a half-dozen John Wayne movies alone that were little more than flag waving propaganda. And even more modern movies like Flags of Our Fathers, while in my view excellent, certainly play as propaganda. Why should the Russians not be proud of beating back Germany? And, no, it was not just the weather that defeated Germany. That would suggest that if Russia had offered no resistance at all that Germany would have retreated at the first snowfall.

So if you are looking for a movie that covers all of Stalingrad, then I must agree with other reviews that this is not what you are looking for. If you want to see a movie about trying to maintain ones humanity in the face of total barbarism, this is pretty well done.",1402444800,5,3975,4.4594222833562585

While the quality of the film making looks very nice ... what prompted me to write this negative review is the utterly TERRIBLE English voice dub.  I wondered sometimes if the folks who translated the dialog into English used Google Translate.  The least the editors could have done is have an English speaking audience review the movie before release ... just so any obvious dumb translations could be corrected.  The translation of the dubbed English dialog is so poor that I highly recommend this movie to students of film making .... as an example of how NOT to dub foreign movie dialog into English.  While I forced myself to watch the whole movie ... I regretfully look back at the evening as a waste of time.

Which is why projectors are far superior to 3d TV's. but... anyways,  this is a decent war film that is basically about men fighting in Stalingrad. Histories worst battle. It does show how people became dehumanized to a huge degree and it should be applauded for that. People on here are complaining about the not being accurate.  It is in the fact that the battle was often about one building being attacked. However this is a drama , and not all about going for a  really true f00% depiction in all details.  So it's got a lot of action and great special effects.  It is no different than the many war movies of the past where the war is the backdrop for the characters.  This is not great cinema but it's well done visually.  It's not as bad as people are saying it is.  It's just like if you watch the young lions or something , which is a drama  first and war movie second  , there is a romance here and that's not uncommon either as many civilians were there and did in fact mate with mainly with their own side though.  So if you like a old fashioned war movie , which basically gets some of it right and gives you five characters to get to know ,  8 actually counting a german officer.

High quality books on the subject include War of the Rats by David Roberts; a German corporal muses as he passes the Tractor Factory ""it's ours, we bought it, and it'll never be worth what we paid for it"" and of course the stellar book Enemy at the Gates. Alas, this movie comes across as made by amateurs; is the director related to the maker of War and Peace and Waterloo? If so he must be senile.

6162741,3,B00HGJB3MC,"Well, for $ 1.28, I suppose I can't complain that much, but I was rather disappointed, in this film. While the special effects were much superior to the 1993 German production of the same title, the earlier film is much better , with a much more compelling story, and lacking the silly romantic side story of this version.
Ironically, the seemingly ubiquitous Thomas Kretschmann was also in the 1993 version, yet, after 20 years, he's still only a hauptmann!  I thought promotion was quicker in wartime?
A Russian production, the movie concentrates primarily on a Russian reconnaisance team facing long odds in the defense of a buliding blocking the German's route to the Volga, and possible final victory in this horrific battle.
The Russian's are given some fleshing out of their characters, but are still somewhat stereotypical types, but not as bad as the Germans, save, perhaps Kretschmann's somewhat conflicted portrayal. His CO, a far too long in the tooth oberstleutnant, is a caricature of the German officer we have seen in so many movies. The killing of Russian civilians, graphically portrayed, was really unecessary, and all too stereotypical.
The scene where the Russians attack through burning gasoline is compelling, but the final German assault, with tanks lined up together like an old cavalry charge, is militarily and historically absurd.
To sum up, it's a film worth watching for anyone with a casual interest in this battle,as long as high expectations are not present.",1400457600,89,1491,5.110655737704918

But, even with having English dubbing when the Russians speak, it is when the Germans speak, that is still heard in German. So, you will end up having to watch the movie with the English sub-titles on the screen anyway, when most of the time, you will just wish they weren't there. There is alot of English dubbing throughout the film, so that's why it is kinda disappointing to have to have the English subtitles on too, just to get through the German parts.

If they just couldn't change the German dubbing to English, it would have been a better experience watching it if had the English subtitles appear ONLY when the Germans speak, and not have them appear while we are hearing English.  The movie ""Tai Chi Zero"" has this same disappointment about having to watch English sub-titles all the way through it, when all I really wanted was to have English sub-titles when the written Chinese print appeared on the screen.

Anyway, this was the first time that I bought a Blu-ray that gave you the 3D version as a second disc instead of a DVD. I prefer it that way because I don't need the inferior DVD or any more DVD's in my collection. I don't have a 3D player yet, but someday I will.

Anyway, about the story itself, it just drags sometimes with it's mellow-drama, then eventually you'll get some really cool fighting scenes. So, perhaps this film may just be a better 3D experience, then to really care to follow any story. The same can be said about the new film ""Pompeii"" that my wife and I saw in 3D at the theatre.  It all looked pretty cool, but the film itself was a rather dull story.

Both the German & Russian side of the film have a love story thread going thru them neither of which adds anything to the film. The subtitles make no sense; the english grammer is either incorrect or out of order. But in the end, the dialogue spoken or the subtitles presented don't really matter. You can understand the story--kill or be killed/war is hell--without translation anyway so enjoy the visual look of the fim--which is great.",1399852800,7,767,4.647058823529412
6162753,5,B00HGJB3MC,"Subtitles were funny...the individual who did them obviously was not completely fluent in English.  But an excellent movie...breathtaking at times...especially the scene where the Soviets are charging the German lines, while they are on fire because of a gasonline explosion ! ..accurate in terms of a series of stories put together (hostorical fiction.....somewhat....mostly true with liberties taken to the plot...but I don't think this all happened to one unit).  The Germans speak german....as do the Russians speak Russian...and the tanks, uniforms and equipment are accurate.  Also....as the Germans speak the narrator will talk also...translating in Russian....not too distracting once you figure out why your hearing two voices.  The few minor items are easily overloooked cause the attention to detail of the uniforms and equpment of the soldiers is superb.  (Minor items:  they dump a dead German body out a window...but notice that the dead German raises his arms to protect his head as he falls to the ground. )

The civilian plot is good, although of the 5 fathers, their seems like I count six many times.  But...it is needed in the excellent overall (fictional... but histroically accurate fiction) plot and point of the film, as one German officer exclaims, ""we fight because it is our jobs, they fight for vengance.""  It also gets a little thick when one Russian states how they are fighting for freedom.  Under communist Stalin....I think not.

It really captures the very different and horrid fighting that occured in Stalingrad.....the hand to hand combat in the rubble and piles of debre....the civilians caught in it.....yet spends alot of time showing how a small group of men could defend against a larger group in this environment, and how they lived and survived under these extreme conditions....the anaolgy to a current Japanese earthquake and the crumbled buildings is a refreshing way to bridge it to modern times.

A must for anyone who likes war movies and/or  is a student of this battle.",1399852800,2,2021,5.181538461538461

6162756,4,B00HGJB3MC,I saw this movie at an Imax theatre in 3 D and that format was awesome. The DVD of course could not match that kind of presentation but its still a story well told (from a Russian perspective) and very realistically filmed. Stalingrad is sacred ground in Russian WWII lore so it was interesting to see how they saw their history. The Blu Ray version is coming soon and I have pre ordered that also.,1398470400,2,398,4.32
6162757,2,B00HGJB3MC,I was very disappointed with this film.  The audio and video quality were both poor.  The storyline and war scenes were also not what I expected.  Would not recommend.,1398470400,2,167,4.689655172413793
6162758,4,B00HGJB3MC,"It was very much a Hollywood-quality production in terms of impact, visuals and overall entertainment value.  This is to be expected as Disney and Sony invested in this film as well as provided extensive personnel and guidance from a production standpoint.  Columbia Pictures is the main distributor so that adds to the Hollywood mix.

That being said this film based on a true story very much reflects traditional Russian values respecting character, courage and duty and thus is a bit of a time capsule of American values of the 1940's or 1950's era. Special effects were not overwhelming and though such scenes as Russian troops charging the Germans through a wall of burning gasoline and the deflection shot with an armour piercing round by the Russians may tax your credulity in real life these happened and far, far worse.

I was disappointed at the quality of editing of the subtitles but on the other hand the film is strong enough visually to carry its own weight without dialogue at all which is a standard characteristic of Russian film which owes its existence to and carries forward the tradition of the live stage and of the opera.

Above it, this is a WYSIWYG product: it says it is a love story and so it is.  Very touching while tough-minded beyond what one would expect.",1398038400,8,1288,4.753363228699552

But the portrayal of the romance between Nazi and the Russian woman was in a word, stupid.  The Nazi held all the interest of well, a blood thirsty Nazi.  The woman's approach to acting is apparently limited to a zombie, with an almost irritating abundance of blank stares at the camera. Since this strangely portrayed romance consumed a good deal of the movie, it unfortunately detracted greatly from an otherwise noble effort.",1397606400,22,694,5.225225225225225

6162764,1,B00HGJB3MC,"A cross between a manic video game and a cartoon, with an incessant, inappropriate, irritating music soundtrack, this film is, for it's overload of effects and crazy camera movement... boring. And excruciating, if you're awake. By the way, the spoken language is Russian and German with subtitles - that's no problem - but when a character speaks in German, some guy does a voice-over in Russian - so that you're faced with deciphering two foreign languages and reading subtitles all at once!!!

Even ""Enemy at the Gates"" is better. But, for anything close to the true horror of that conflict,  the definitive is the 1992 German film ""Stalingrad"".

Surviving the actual Battle of Stalingrad was easier than making it all the way through this clattering, catastrophic cacophony!",1397001600,14,777,5.102362204724409
6162765,3,B00HGJB3MC,"""Each soldier fought the best he could but they didn't realize that they were participating in the bloodiest battle in the history of mankind."" In 1942 WWII has come to Stalingrad. In order to stop the German advance the Russian army must fight back and hold the city or the country could fall. When a group of soldiers sent to protect a building find two women living there they find another reason to fight. Lately the war movie genre has been a lot like the western genre. There are a lot being made and about 10% are good. While I would put this one in the good category there are still some flaws in this. It was a bigger budget movie then most and the war sequences were actually very good, even though the 300 type effects were overused. The main downfall with this movie is when there was no action the movie really slowed down and I started to lose interest a few times. Other then that though this was good and in terms of recent war movies this is one of the better ones. Overall, a good movie but would have been better if it was shorter and the love story aspects were sped up a little. I give this a B-",1396656000,16,1116,4.219626168224299
6162766,5,B00HGJB3MC,"This film played in an IMAX theater that was too far for me to drive so I was pleased to be able to order the film online for a reasonable price with minimal shipping charge. I was a Russian major in college so I rely on Russian language films with clear subtitles to keep up with the language. A must see for fans of WW2. This film gives a new and inspiring take on the battle for Stalingrad, a slice of life in bombed out buildings detailing day to day survival and sacrifices both military and civilian on the eastern front of the war zone. If the Russians hadn't broken the back of the German war machine in Stalingrad then D-day in the western front might have come later on the timeline. Both Germans and Russians are portrayed with some sympathy and this film has an old fashioned feel of old time war movies where courage is applauded.",1396396800,7,843,4.341772151898734
6162767,5,B00HGJB3MC,"I had the privilege of seeing Stalingrad in IMAX and it was an experience! The visual effects are fantastic and that alone make it a pleasure to watch.

Stalingrad is a POPULAR film and I don't think the director ever had any intention of creating a ""realistic"" re-telling of the battle. Just one look at the trailer should be enough to warn away any thoughts of historic realism. I didn't personally notice any glaringly annoying inaccuracies that did not have a purpose. (For example, the ""house"" still has furniture and wallpaper and everything else that would have long burned away in the initial firestorm, but it's needed to create that sense of ""home"" for the main characters. How visually boring would an empty, scorched room be?) The oil tank assault was not ""historically accurate"" either, but was a way to incorporate some of the flavors of the battle into a KICK-A CG sequence!

What Stalingrad does do well is capture the horrors and emotion of war for both soldiers and civilians. A number of people complained about the lead female character and the romantic subplot but I felt going into the film knowing it was meant as a popular film for a wide audience- not just a ""war"" movie- it was not nearly so bad. At least she has a character and is not a cardboard cut-out of a love interest.

One of the most relieving aspects of the story was that it shied away from the established role of ""righteous good guys"" vs ""demonized, war-criminal enemies"". While we didn't get a strong sense of life for the common German soldier, it was definitely a step in the right direction. No one side was inherently evil and each had their own motivations. Both did some horrid things.

The director did well in getting across his message, but the movie lacked an epic, underlying theme that makes a true classic... and left me walking out just a little disappointed. It sent a good message, just not one strong enough to catapult it into greatness.

Overall, the visual effect are truly spectacular and make it worth watching alone. I think it's a movie worth the price once the 3-D Blu-Ray is available.",1396224000,10,2102,4.6702702702702705

* Technically it was accurate as a made for TV movie.  Idiotic tactics and unrealistic situations abound.  That's just lazy writing as Deadpool would say.
* Instead of an epic film about one of the greatest battles in history, they revolved it around 2 farcical and overly dramatized love stories.  Cringe worthy.

8632676,2,B00HGJB3MC,"Stalingrad was shot in discreet native 3D...but you almost wouldn't know it. It used a device that with a touch of a button would , for example, flatten out foreground & background areas and/or objects in a given shot at the same time while not affecting midground imaging and was implemented via a component added on to the 3D rig. It was a deplorable practice & ruined the 3D aspect of almost every scene of every film it was used on.  In fact to say its distracting is being too polite.  This was done, I believe, to satisfy a technical demand made by the now defunct SkyTV 3D channel along with another movie service.  The practice carried into other 3D projects as well & became the catalyst (as I understand it) that finally led to the wider use of 2D to 3D conversions. In the case of Stalingrad it should have utilized a 3D conversion facility to fix every one of those altered 3D scenes...which is the majority of the film.  This technical blunder lessens the overall impact...what there is of it... of Stalingrad with its abbreviated 3D look.
