8036861,4,B0006213P8,"Received the YOU ARE THERE's DVDs of this WORLD WAR ll BEGINS and one other (THE INVASION). I found them most enjoyable and as they are old 1950s TV programs, it is almost like seeing them for the first time, none of those problems you get because it is old TV. They used actors playing real people, but they are interview by real CBS News reporters! You don't see the reporters most of the time, the actors talked to you and answered yours questions (real reporter voice off camera), making you feel as you were there in person, seeing history in the making. You feel as you are part of history, as YOU ARE THERE! There are two errors on the Amazon.com page about these DVDs of YOU ARE THERE. One of the errors hurts me as a Hollenbeck, there is no Don Hollenbeck, real life CBS TV and radio news reporter on these two DVDs. Also the programs were aired in 1956, because it said so at the end of the programs, not 1953. Hollenbeck died in 1954 (see the movie GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK), so it is not possible for him to be on these YOU ARE THERE programs, for these came from 1956, not 1953. I hope Amazon would check this out and correct the errors. As for the other YOU ARE THERE DVDs, reporter Don Hollenbeck may be on them and may be from 1953. But not on WORLD WAR ll BEGINS and THE INVASION. But other then that, these are great programs, and as history, not bad at all.",1177545600,5,1377,4.2
