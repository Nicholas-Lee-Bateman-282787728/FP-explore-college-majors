I am a Native American manga artist specializing in Spirit Animals legends and Myths. So going back in time and living history was right up my ally. The waring States period in Japan but instead of a bunch of old guys theirs a bunch of young girls trying to unite Japan under on ruler. I love history and even if you don't you will like the Ambition of Oda Nobuna. The art work is very good and the ladies are well very hot, the story line is very funny. My only beef is the fact that once again the male lead is again the punching bag of all the girls. It's over done and to tell you the truth I have a Nice and her father dose not want her to learn to treat people like that. this may be a little to mature subject mater for her age that's not the point humor based on violence and gender discrimination is wrong. I still found myself liking the history of it very much. I would call this a romantic history all be it a rude romantic history anime. Getting past that I still think it was very good to be able to make history or at the very least be right their when it's happening is great.  One Thumb Up",1423267200,,1253,4.012
6604891,4,B00MZ3X8KE,"Synopsis:

The Ambition of Oda Nobuna is a gender swapped retelling of the end of the sengoku,or warring states period of Japanese history.  Most of the major historical figures have been transformed into girls, and time traveler Sagara Yoshiharu, a high school student from modern day Japan, full of knowledge about the period from playing simulation games, uses his knowledge to change the events so everything works out the way he wants it to, but what consequences will come from tampering with history?

The Ambition of Oda Nobuna is a mixed bag of mostly interesting, definitely entertaining, and a bit disturbing, historical gender swapped harem comedy.  I'm currently working on my masters in ancient and classical history, so I am very interested in Japanese history and I was intrigued by this anime when I got a flyer for it with another purchase I made a few months ago.  Now that I've watched it, I'd have to say I enjoyed it, but I'm definitely scratching my head at some of the decisions the creators made.

Lets break it down:

Art: 7.0 The animation is competent, but not outstanding.  I don't have a problem with using still frames when used appropriately, but I think they relied on them a bit too much.  One scene in particular, when Nobuna's army is besieging her little brother's fortress, and everyone is chanting Nobuna's name.  It looked weird that nobody was moving, not even their mouths.  Still, the character designs were interesting.  Especially Inuchiyo, and while a purple haired girl wearing a tiger hood and wielding a huge spear sounds strange, it looks pretty cool. I understand the gender swapping, and that does make for an interesting premise, but the age reduction went a bit too far.  The character who would eventually be Tokugawa Iyeyasu was a little girl with mouse ears and a tail, probably about eight years old.  I can't imagine what inspires an army to follow that into battle.  I'm sure this was played for laughs, but it elicits more of a WTF than an LOL.  The action and the fight scenes were well done, and I wish there had been more.

Story: 7.0  Here's where I had very mixed feelings.  Overall, I liked it.  There were a lot of historical details which made me happy, such as Yoshiharu taking Toyotomi Hideyoshi's place as sandal bearer in the Oda court, and Nobuna dancing and praying before the battle of Okehazama, but there were some blatantly anachronistic things which made me cringe.  Yoshimoto Imagawa and Ieyasu Tokugawa playing soccer (that wasn't kemari, there was a net), an assassin using a sniper rifle with a modern scope two hundred years before the RIFLE was invented, Yoshitatsu Saito running around with a cannon which can fire repeatedly without reloading, Hisahide Matsunaga attacking Kyoto with war elephants?  So many historical details, balanced with so much absolute nonsense.  It would be different if it were explained, or played for comedy, but it's not.

Characters: 6.0  Again, mixed feelings.  There really isn't a lot of character development.  Nobuna and Yoshiharu make in interesting couple.  I'd have to say that the male leads in most harem comedies are the worst kind of fish out of water, ineffectual, plankton of any characters in anime, but happily, Yoshiharu actually drives the plot of the show, and is incredibly knowledgeable about the world he has been dropped into.  He's actually a strong leader and that made for a pleasant surprise.  The rest of the harem are fun to watch, and Nagahide Niwa's running gag of assigning point values to other character's actions is amusing.  But really, we are never told anything about Yoshiharu's life before he magically gets transported into bizarro sengoku Japan.  Nor do we know how he got there.  We do get some of Nobuna'a background, but the rest are pretty much blank slates.  The biggest problem I had character wise was definitely Hanabe Takenaka, who is supposed to be some incredible strategist, but never comes up with a single plan or strategy, but instead uses marginally effective magic to little effect.  Sometimes I get the feeling Hanabe is only included in the series so we can have a scene of an eight year old girl with her shirt off, and that's pretty disturbing.  More on that later.

Sound: 7.0  The dub was actually quite good.  I thought all the voices fit the characters well.  The high point would definitely be Hilary Haag as the ninja Goemon.  The little girl ninja with a lisp was actually very entertaining.  The music was competent, but not outstanding.  It worked to complement the scenes, and the opening and closing songs were good, but nothing memorable and certainly nothing I'm going to listen to by itself.

Fan Service:  This isn't a category on which I usually comment, and I'm normally cool with fan service in a show, but here it needs to be addressed.  There really isn't too much of it, quantity wise, and some of it is actually kinda funny, such as Katsuie Shibata's boobs bouncing... in armor!  How that works is beyond me, but it's worth a laugh (or a giggle).  Louise Frois's bounciness is a bit on the excessive side, but the real problem is the younger characters.  Goemon, the little ninja girl with a lisp is followed around by a gang of grown men who cheer about how sexy she is... awkward.  Yoshiharu's ""little sister"" Nene, who in real history would have been his wife, is like five or six years old, and we still get the occasional kimono slipping off her shoulder, etc.  The worst, however, is Hanabe, who is apparently about ten years old, and gets sick and has to be undressed and 'cooled down' to reduce her fever (why is Yoshiharu present for this?).  I think we are supposed to laugh at Yoshiharu's uncomfortable predicament, but I felt like I was the one in the uncomfortable spot.  So glad the wife or daughter didn't walk in while that scene was on.

Overall:  6.75  For all its faults, this anime has an interesting story and likeable characters.  I found it enjoyable.  If you like Japanese history, and you'd like to see it thrown in a blender and mixed with a healthy dose of romantic comedy, then give this a try.  It is a bit on the expensive side, and the DVDs didn't come with any real extras to speak of.  Still, I'm not disappointed with my purchase.",1422662400,4,6266,4.757884972170687
6604892,5,B00MZ3X8KE,"The premise is similar to Battle Girls Time Paradox: female characters replace historical male figures and a character from the present, but that's where the similarities end. This is not a panty or boob show and the comedy is not too zany. Although it has its moments of fan service, it is very little and relatively mild. The dub has Emily Neves and Clint Bickham as the two ""would-be"" lovers, so it sounds similar to Dusk Maiden of Amnesia...only less serious. The story is a short 12 episodes with no filler--some action, lots of comedy and very little angst. This is NOT a harem anime. While it is true the male character is surrounded by mostly beautiful women throughout the show--they are not trying to bed him or romance him (except for one other toward the end).
Pleasant story, good voice talents, and no drag in the story telling make this one watchable many times. (I've seen it 3 times already and I've only had it a week.)",1416873600,6,937,4.583333333333333
6604893,4,B00MZ3X8KE,This is a great anime I gave it four stars cause it will never have a 2nd season. Basically a dude from the present to an alternate past where all the major warlords are...... you guessed hot young women. It is straight forward harem history with a twist where he take the place of toyotomi hideyoshi who after the death of nobunaga united the land. If you like Japanese history and harems this is the anime for you. If you don't like well your missing out.,1414627200,2,457,4.325581395348837
6604894,4,B00MZ3X8KE,i havnt heard of this series before but i wonder how it will turn out. And if its going to be dubed,1409961600,,99,3.5454545454545454
6604895,4,B00MZ3X8KE,"Yoshiharu Sagara is a modern-day Japanese teenager who suddenly finds himself thrown back into Sengoku period of Japan, roughly the mid-1500's AD. He quickly finds himself being targeted by soldiers, but is saved by an old man who sacrifices his life to save the young man. Said man turns out to be the legendary Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of the unifiers of feudal Japan, and Yoshiharu quickly finds out he'll have to do the same things the historical figure did in order to help Oda Nobuna fulfill her dream of uniting a fragmented Japan under one ruler.

At first glance it may seem like a harem show, where several girls go after one guy. However, for the most part it's downplayed as Yoshiharu is only really interested in Nobuna. There are a lot of gender-bent characters, meaning characters who were historically men are women in the show, such as Akechi Mitsuhide. This ends up playing a role in some parts of the plot as well. The show is more focused on fantasy and action as Yoshiharu uses his knowledge of the modern world along with the Sengoku period to defeat Nobuna's various enemies.

There is some fighting in the show, but nothing too gory or bloody despite the hints of heavy casualties in some of the battles. This is balanced by some comedic slice-of-life scenes in between the battles that take place.

Overall I enjoyed it. It's not the greatest anime ever, but it was enjoyable enough to watch it a couple of times on crunchyroll's website. I'm glad it's finally getting a release on disc in the US.",1409270400,16,1521,4.667910447761194

6604905,3,B00MZ3X8KE,"Buyer Beware!!!!!

This anime has geo-blocking DRM. What does that mean? Means I am unable to play this US release anime on a US blu-ray player (I got my player at Costco). The DRM is supposed to stop people outside the US and Canada from playing the anime. I purchased this show legaly through amazon here in the US and this is what I get? .....thanks Sentai Filmworks. Sentai Filmworks is apparently adding this geo-blocking DRM to all there stuff. And no I can't change the region setting on my blu-ray player so there is nothing to be done there. Not saying this will happen to everyone who buys this anime, this is just to make people aware that  this show might not play.

UPDATE: My Panisonic player was the problem. Samsung player played discs no problem :) Finally saw the anime....the show is worth exactly the $30 you pay....not legendary (despite it's plot) but a nice distraction.",1426723200,,893,4.639240506329114

8675420,5,B00MZ3X8KE,"- Comments: Pretty funny and fan-service filled anime. We got an energetic and perverted main character for this anime. Though he's pretty likable, I think.
===========================================================================================================

- Synopsis: Due to his random circumstance, he ends up coming from the future and tries to change history. Which, if you've seen stuff like Steins;Gate, would know it's a bad idea. But nevertheless, this anime is fairly happy and simple, so it's all good. I did enjoy it a lot since I'd rather have waifus and such than old men. Not that accurate, but that detail is much appreciated.

- Features: Japanese and English audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 3 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence and fan-service.

- Conclusion: Overall, a good anime to relax to while learning some Japanese historical events from the past. But instead of old men, we mainly got waifus. Ayy. An easy to understand anime where past meets future. It lacks some serious plot, and character development, but since it's more of a historical genre, I believe they tired to retain that factor as opposed to some dynamic development in various ways. It's also relatively light-hearted, making it easy to enjoy and have some laughs without having to make your brain work hard.
