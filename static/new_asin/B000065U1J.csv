1709710,1,B000065U1J,"Just a few stupid things I noticed that Hollywood would call Artistic License, I call it ""writers smoking crack"". The long Beach Harbor where The Queen Mary is docked is surrounded on either 2 or 3 sides by a penninsula. The ship is also stuck about 10 feet in the mud. No way a wave could have crossed all that and still knocked that ship over. Also when he steals the small motor boat, A) when they are heading away from shore, it shows open sea. Wrong! There is land there. B) If that boat had tried to climb a real tidal wave, it would not have had the mass or the power. It would have been slapped back like a bug, not to mention not being able to go through it and jump out the other side. And finally, if they created a second wave to collide with the first, they would NOT have canceled each other out, they would have passed through each other and kept going. Also if you were watching the two waves from shore from the angle they saw them, they were heading North and South. What would have happened in San Diego? A magic turn East? LOL. It never ceases to amaze me how stupid Hollywood thinks we are by passing this crap off on us. These actors must really be desperate for a paycheck to embarrass themselves like that.",1116288000,2,1230,4.216101694915254
1709711,3,B000065U1J,"TIDAL WAVE is an average disaster flick with acceptable CGI effects.  Corbin Bernsen plays the hero, a ""retired"" military man who has made nuclear warheads for various shady undercover endeavors.  His nemesis is Gregg Henry, playing a limping smart mouth who is sure that Bernsen is the one responsible for a series of devastating tsunamis.  Julianne Phillips (Skin Deep) plays a potential love interest who joins Bernsen's side.  Harve Presnell (Unsinkable Molly Brown) plays Harvey Schutt, the mentor of Bernsen.

The movie lags at times, and inevitably Bernsen and Phillips must find someone who will believe that they are not the ones causing the tsunamis.

Laurence Hilton-Jacobs (Room 222) plays a veteran cop who vacillates between belief and disbelief.

Certainly not a POSEIDON ADVENTURE or TOWERING INFERNO, but for a low budget flick, it's okay.",1092787200,7,856,5.296296296296297
1709712,2,B000065U1J,"DVD features: None
First off the dvd features are bad. Only 2.0 sound english and scene selection make this movie already seem bad. The movie is about a terrorist who is making tidal waves and only 2 people can stop them. This movie lacks character development and and a series of dialogue that is uninteresting and intended to explain how tidal waves are possibly made. Some of the dialogue gets too technical thus making the film lame and boring. Next the special effects are weak and action is little in this film. This movie features mild violence and disaster moment but I would recommend this as a family movie (this movie has no rating). I would highly recommend you don't buy this movie.",1059264000,2,695,4.658536585365853

1709715,1,B000065U1J,"Corbin (The Dentist) Bernson is a famous scientist who, do to some ethical and emotional trauma, has turned his back on the world to play with his pet dog and surf.  Too bad his past as a super-duper weapons designer catches up with him as man made tidal waves threaten life as we know it in the U.S. of A!  Julianne Phillips shows up to provide love interest and Gregg (Body Double) Henry is the hissable government goon that is convinced that it's all really Corbin's doing.  Laurence Hilton Jacobs (of Welcome Back Kotter fame) plays an FBI agent, but since he's the token black he doesn't make it to the half way point of this made for television disaster thriller.  The special effects are, naturally, TV movie level so they're pretty darn bad (computer generated super waves and water blown out of hoses) and the acting only a little bit better.

OK--let's see if somehow the silkscreen labels were reversed:  YES, Tidal Wave is actually Killer Wave, and vice versa.  So far, still acceptable, as consider the movie:  NOT the ""Ten Commandments!""  BUT, in the middle of Tidal Wave (actually Killer Wave!) just as the wave hits the Maine coast, CREDITS START!  I was thinking like ""IS THIS IT?""  But then I notice that we are on ""Scene 9 of 17.""  A click of the advance button, and the wave resumes crashing on the Maine town and the movie keeps going!

As for Tidal Wave it was okay Not totally original in conception in Idea but passable and pleasant to watch. The acting of the players was okay as far as I was concerned and worked well in the movie. Over all I thought the movie played out well and definitely worth having as I watch it periodically watch over again every so often as its part of my collection of disaster movies.",1387152000,,699,4.453125

I had seen Killer Wave before and this one is fun for its type. However, this version is cropped on top and bottom, and the composition looks cramped. It's uncomfortable to watch. You can tell there is business we were supposed to see but cannot see because it's below frame because of the cropping.

Occasionally in this movie there are frames consisting of multiple images in separate boxes of differing size above and below. Those frames are not cropped on top and bottom, and there are wide black areas on the left and right, proving that the original intention for this film was a 4:3 aspect ratio.

I know there are many apologists on Amazon who defend the reprehensible practice of cropping to fit modern screens, and it would be amusing to hear them rationalize this one. Please, entertain me.",1384732800,13,884,4.547169811320755

1709828,2,B000065U1J,"Tidal Wave No Escape & Killer Wave were both written and co-produced by Tedi Sarafian.  The original film (Tidal Wave No Escape) first aired on TV in 1997.  The subsequent miniseries (Killer Wave) aired in 2007.  It's obvious that the latter movie was an unnecessary remake, keeping most of the same elements as the first (just dragging them out for the sake of time in the miniseries version).  Neither of these movies have content worth bragging about.  The gist of both stories concern madmen out to destroy coastal communities by producing tsunamis and blaming these acts of terrorism on a sap (Corbin Bernsen in the first film, Angus MacFadyen in the second).  Wrongly accused, these idiots spend the bulk of the movie(s) on the run while trying to uncover who's really behind the destruction.  Greed for fame and power is the supposed reasons supporting these actions.  The villains in both movies are obvious at the outset.  The villain in the first movie only had one sidekick, in the miniseries there were subordinates all over the place killing people like crazy.  Along for the ride in both projects were two women incapable of brewing a good cup of coffee (Julianne Phillips in the first movie and Karine Vanasse in the second).  The main differences in these two projects, besides the cast, is the overriding sense of hysteria in the first movie and a peculiar lack of urgency in the second.  I was totally underwhelmed by both and thought it more than a little redundant to film the same stupid story twice.  It didn't improve with the retelling.  I'm not keeping either to watch again.",1383177600,,1600,4.813186813186813

1709830,3,B000065U1J,"The Double-Feature movies have much potential.  It looks like a generic-version of a real action-pack adventure.  The only complaint is that both movies have almost the same storyline.  It's like one is a rip-off from the other, although one is more interesting than the other.

The ""boring one"" will seem to have finished in the middle of the movie because the credits appear mid-movie.  If you bypass the credits, the movie will resume 'til the end.",1373328000,,451,4.881578947368421

When I see all of the other reviewers behaving like snobs as if they are so much better than the people who made the movie, it makes me sick.

1709846,5,B000065U1J,"I remember watching this unintentional comedy with great joy.  It seems that some viewers were put off by the fact that this movie, which presumably was meant to be a thrilling action/disaster flick, turned out to be a non stop laugh till the tears are streaming down your face festival of absurdity.  I have never really understood how a person can blame a movie for wasting their time.  Allow me to reinterpret what the other reviewers were really trying to say.  Please do not go into this movie expecting to be swept away and taken on any kind of thrill ride.  Unless you are at pre-school or possibly kindergarten level of understanding you will find only humor here, and the laughs abound.  I, for one, enjoy laughing.  I also think that sometimes the funniest movies are the ones that were not intended to be of the comedy genre.  I do, also, understand that this movie is not one that is going to get the appreciation it deserves from everyone.  It takes a certain mindset to enjoy a great work of cinema like this.  As far as I'm concerned when you combine disenchanted military trained genius turned adversary with prototypical heroic figures, add a dash of natural disaster, and top it off with plenty of goofy action from the characters (thanks to a director who possesses utter contempt for the laws of physics and all other sciences), seldom can you go terribly wrong.  I know it has been done before, but if the recipe works, keep baking.  That is my advice.

Listen carefully, my dear readers, unless for some unknown reason an evil villain (most likely wearing a very scary mask of some sort) armed with an ominous weapon and/or spectacularly morbid super power(s) has intruded into your home and forced you to watch something against your will, you don't have to watch it.  I suggest that you follow these simple instructions:  1) Change the channel to something that you find entertaining.  What is that?  You say there is nothing else on.  Ok, read on.  2)Change your mind set.  Just because you are told that a film is of a certain genre does not make it so.  Believe me, this kind of skeptical thinking will enrich your life.  3)Try some self medication.  This tends to promote adjustment from a stale mindset.  4) Brace yourself, I'm about to say something that will no doubt shock you and leave you gasping for breath.  Do something else.  You could watch a movie on Blue Ray, DVD, VHS, Beta, or any other format you see fit.  You could get online and search the internet for something entertaining.  Read a book.  Listen to some music.  Make some music.  Bake a pie.  Knit a sweater.  Take a walk.  Ride a bike.  Build a sandcastle.  Play with your dog.  If you don't have a dog go play with the neighbors dogs.  If you don't like dogs play with another animal.  There really are so many other things to do.  It may sound difficult, and to some it is at first.  However, let me assure you, with just a little practice if you follow my advice you too can learn.  I guarantee it will add more enjoyment to your life.  I mean, after all, who wants to sit through something that is boring them or, worse yet, making them sick.

I would go into more details about the plot, but it's been a long time since I have seen this.  As I read through the other reviews many fond memories came back to me.  Basically what you have here is a mad man that is creating ""tidal waves"" by firing torpedos at underwater rock formations causing them to collapse, thus creating a killer wave to do his bidding.  Enter Corbin Bernsen, who plays a weapons specialist and Julianne Philips his oceanographer partner ready and willing to save the day in whatever ridiculous manner they are required to perform there goofy duties.  Our nutty villain has threatened to wipe out California if his demands are not met.  I can't remember what his demands were.  I guess I was too busy laughing at the humor to pick up that part of the story line.  I unfortunately don't remember the part about him threatening to destroy Mt Fuji, as one overly harsh critic has tried to warn us about.  One can only hope that he is correct.  Rest assured, my precious audience, even if the Mt. Fuji part was hallucinated (I reiterate ""one can only hope that he is correct"") there are many hilarious things to enjoy here.  Actually the title says it all.  No way you're going to escape from this tidal wave, it's just too good.

So buy this movie (it's only 3.30 used with the shipping).  I can assure you that this takes several viewings to understand all the details that are at play in this cinematic experience.  I am not suggesting here that the plot is complex in anyway.  What I am saying is that you will most likely laugh so uncontrollably that you will miss a small detail here and there such as what is motivating the bad guy to behave in such a menacing way to california and Mt Fuji (as the case may be).  Grab a bag of popcorn, you big goof you, this is one that is not to be missed.  It has become clear to me that I am due for another viewing.  I promise you, Amazon, I intend to order this one just as soon as I get through my current must view list.

On a side note I would prefer to give this movie the 3-3.5 stars it most likely deserves.  I feel it is only fair to go with 5 to help balance out the reviews here.  I honestly did find this movie very funny.  Yes there are greater unintentional comedies out there, but if you're at all of my mindset you'll have to admit that if there is a possibility that Mt Fuji is at risk of being taken out by a tsunami, well my good friends, that is just too good to pass up.  It takes a creative mind to think of something as ridiculous as that.  Is there a movie that Corben Bernsen will not do?  I would just love to get my hands on that script.  Ahhhh... that would be just priceless.",1340236800,3,5821,4.3958724202626644

About the only thing interesting or worthwhile about this movie is the special effects of the tsunami...but even those aren't so great.  This movie is universally bad.  So bad it's almost funny, though, which is why I gave it a star.

The script is absolutely terrible and not believable at all.  I wasn't expecting much, but thought it would be interesting to see a movie about a tsunami; unfortunately,  I was wrong. Don't waste your time or money.  Don't even rent it...really.

7961516,3,B000065U1J,"The disks are both there. One of the movies on each disk. Only problem being they are labled wrong. ""Tidal Wave"" has the ""Killer Wave"" artwork on the disk and the other disk, with the ""Tidal Wave"" artwork contains the ""Killer Wave"" movie. Disks are otherwise playable and in good shape. The movies themselves are watchable, though both written by the same person and produced by the same guy, so the story is similar.",1456876800,,417,4.648648648648648
