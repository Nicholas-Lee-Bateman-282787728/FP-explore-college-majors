8500014,5,B000GBBTIA,"This in my opinion is the best death/thrash metal DVD to ever come out. It has a dual disc which features the band's live show in their home town of Montreal. Awesome show. There's the third DVD which features the drum footage of the entire show. Yanic is great on drums...only the bass parts are not shown. The show also has Oscar Suoto of Anonymous and Alex Auburn of Cryptopsy as guest appearences. MUST BUY for any death metal fan.
