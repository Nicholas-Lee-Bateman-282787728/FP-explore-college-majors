7872067,5,6304473958,don't know how it happens but this is joyful and wistful simultaneously.,1410652800,,72,5.083333333333333
7872068,5,6304473958,"This is a film I have never, ever tired of viewing.  The background of beauty which is Ireland, the power of the Irish horses and the warm, lush melodies of the Chieftains combine in a magnificent story the likes of which only National Geographic can put together, in their style.  I've run out of adjectives!!  Being an American Citizen of Ireland (my father was born and raised in Ireland) and thus interested in anything Celtic, I want to fall through the screen into those lovely backdrops and scenes and always end up crying.  I have waited so long to go there and it's possible this may happen within a few years, God willing.  But I can take a mini-trip by merely popping this tape into the machine---and letting go.  Thank you, National Geographic!",1160092800,2,756,4.646616541353383
7872069,5,6304473958,"The music, and everything else in this video is wonderful to watch. I love horses, and Ireland, and it mixes the two together in a really beautiful protrayel.",1131580800,3,158,4.678571428571429
7872070,5,6304473958,Absolutely the most beautiful documentary I've seen on both horses and the Irish people who love them. Incredible music by the Chieftans fits the images to a T. Absolutely perfect!,1105142400,3,180,5.033333333333333
7872071,5,6304473958,"Granted the Irish are ""the horse people"" but this is a great video documentary.  Kids love it adults too! I have loaned my copy out more times than any other in my collection. Everyone has thanked me.  It is a history lesson of both horses and Ireland.  Anyone with an interest in  either will enjoy this tape. Very entertaining and informative.",949449600,20,345,4.60655737704918
