8731049,4,B014K364IY,"The main problem I have with this blu-ray presentation of Je T'aime Je T'aime is the color scheme. It looks as though a blue filter has been applied to the entire film, the effect is so strong I found it distracting and uncomfortable to watch. If you check out the blu-ray's extras, the shots of the film there are PERFECT, so something funny is going on. I found it impossible to dial back in naturalistic tones with TV settings. A real shame, because underneath that blue is a good looking movie. I have uploaded a comparison between the footage in the extras (top) and the film (bottom).

From blu-ray.com: ""There is a very obvious shift towards a prominent range of unusually cold blues and grays that can appear quite overwhelming at times""

From dvdbeaver.com: ""It leans a little teal/steely blue/grey (more than I would like)""",1464912000,19,833,4.7379310344827585
8731050,4,B014K364IY,"Resnais is haunted by time and memory(viz:- Hiroshima Mon Amour, Muriel, Last Year in Marienbad). Je taime, je taime, is his attempt to revisit a mans memory of his past love who committed suicide, through a sci-fi framework. A group of researchers have built a time machine and have sent as mouse back in time for 1 minute. However they need a human subject, one who having survived suicide, has nothing to lose. He wants to return to a time when he was at his happiest with his beloved, Catrine. Claude ( Claude Rich) becomes hopelessly lost and unstuck in time, as the machine jumps from one memory to another, in the process something goes wrong, and the patients memories become fragmented, uncoiling in bits and pieces, out of order, sometimes looping back again and again. In the process, we see arelationship come together and fall apart, and the tragic nature of what were watching isn't clear until the final moments. The question is, did Resnais film the memories in the same random order that the novelist, Jacques Sternberg, wrote them? Moment to moment, were unclear of what were seeing even when it seems so simple, so plain. As the narrative continues to spin around like a zoetrope, a visit to the beach or a quiet conversation in bed acquires new meanings as the film progresses. Its as much a love story, or a science-fiction story, as it is a story about storytelling itself, and continues on themes which Resnais has treated before. The surreality of each image and scene, lies like shattered glass. Were left to put the pieces back together, tracing the rapturous highs and turbulent lows of his relationship with his girlfriend Catrine (Olga Georges-Picot). Ridder is trapped in an isolated world of his own fractured, infinitely repeating memories.

Resnais captures the seemingly mundane rituals of everyday life-dead time- that define the essence of human existence. Ridder's unremarkable life is presented in terse and abstract episodes that, although also eschewing narrative, inherently illustrate a complexity of form, experience, tactility, and emotional realism. In the end, it is the film's organic ability to convey depth and texturality that elicits pathos and humanity for the deeply flawed, alienated, modern day tragic hero imprisoned by the eternal torment of his inescapable, haunted memories. This is a remarkable film-a link between Markers La Jete and Gondrys The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind-which doesnt quite come off, as you cant quite pin-point the moment the lovers drifted apart. A cubistic structure is built up from a mans life cut in pieces. Its compelling technically, not emotionally: Claude is a neurotic daydreamer, and cant effect any changes, washed on the tides of fractured memory like a jellyfish. Like the haunting image of the mouse at the end the self is trapped in a glass cage, gasping for air. An astringent artistry is at play behind it all.",1464307200,2,2919,5.018556701030928

8731052,5,B014K364IY,I love Resnais' early films; they show a willingness to experiment with time that I missed in other New Wave directors. Claude Rich does an excellent job of portraying a man trying to reconstruct his life after a suicide attempt. I would compare it to Last Year In Marienbad in its careful sifting through the evidence of memories and desire.,1454716800,,342,4.716666666666667
8731053,2,B014K364IY,"It is very difficult to rate this film, I wanted to give this film a better rating but I just could not get through it with a positive impression.  The film really wore me down and nearly put me to sleep. Before viewing the film I read some professional reviews on Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) and all of them had one thing in common, namely that the film is ahead of its time, and I must say that I agree with that statement.  An ordinary person or movie-goer would not last to the end.  The reason for is that, the film is composed of incoherent scenes which are than organized in asynchronous order.  The concept was very innovative and original for its time, but on the other hand it is confusing and consequently hard to follow.  Resnais (the film director) also incorporates too much of ""philosophical"" and ""existentialist"" dialogue into many of its scenes.  Making the film lose its original theme, which is the love-lost.  Instead of having the key two characters talk to each other like normal human beings and what lead to their break-up, the main protagonist blabbers about a pencil or paper, or about some incoherent and irrelevant things that make him seem insane or a boring individual.  Also, was anyone out there able to understand if the hero really killed his girlfriend? I was unable to comprehend his dialogue when he was confessing about killing her, but not being able,...to me he was the most boring and confusing individual I have ever seen on the movie screen.  He makes the character of Hamlet or actor Ben Stein seem like interesting fellas.

Instead of watching this boring and highly artistic piece of French cinema that border lines on science fiction, I would recommend seeing instead: Alphaville (1965), The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Memento (2000), or simply any film by Godard from the 60's...all of which are similar in context to Je t'aime je t'aime but are easier to grasp.",1452988800,5,1928,4.711309523809524
8731054,5,B014K364IY,"For the viewer who is bored of the same old narrative techniques, ""Je T'aime, Je T'aime"" is an interesting challenge.  The jumping back and forth between fragments of the time traveller's past makes the viewer an active participant in reconstructing the story.  This film is 31 years ahead of ""Memento,"" ""21 Grams,"" and ""La Vie en Rose.""  Clearly, the 1968 audience wasn't ready for it, but current movie fans are!",1447372800,12,414,4.885714285714286
8731055,3,B014K364IY,"Je taime, je taime focuses on Claude Ridder (Claude Rich), who is recovering from an unsuccessful suicide attempt after the failure of his relationship with Catrine (Olga Georges-Picot). He is approached by a mysterious scientific lab that wants him to participate in the human trials of a new time travel device. The test will send him back one year, for a minute. But the machine malfunctions and Ridder gets caught in a never-ending series of time leaps, reliving his tragic life in a jumbled sequence. His past is a nightmare he wants to escape.

Director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima Mon Amour, Last Year at Marienbad)) might have told this story chronologically, but the time warp plot gimmick allows him to tell his story more cinematically, with flashbacks and flashforwards constituting the narrative. The science-fiction premise is merely a device to explore the relationship between Ridder and Catrine by showing us what happened in the past to drive Ridder to attempt taking his own life. The problem is that by doling out shards of memories and pieces of conversation, Resnais fails to involve us emotionally. Brief flashes of scenes repeat as newly revealed information alters their meanings each time. A sustained scene or two would help us empathize with Ridder. The time travel premise metaphorically suggests the habit of replaying ones failures and the need to make sense out of both true love and despair.

Je taime, je taime is a nearly abstract jigsaw puzzle of repeated dialogue and impressionistic images. The switching around from past to present and back again eventually wears thin and appears more cinematic showing-off than viable method of exposition. Like Ridder, the viewer ultimately feels hes the subject of an experiment gone amiss. The movie is in French, with optional English subtitles.",1446854400,8,1820,5.1661016949152545
