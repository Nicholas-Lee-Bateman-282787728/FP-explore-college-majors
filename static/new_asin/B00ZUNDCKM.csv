7295270,5,B00ZUNDCKM,"Well, I think this is the DVD all Sting fans had been waiting for, since the release of ""The Best of Sting"" a few years back. ""The Best of Sting"" wasn't a bad collection, but I think the thing most fans felt was missing from that particular collection was hearing from the man himself & Steve Borden reflecting on his career over the decades.

""Into the Light"" has plenty of that, as Disc 1 and the beginning of Disc 2 feature Steve Borden--sans facepaint--going over his years at the old NWA/WCW and his recent return to ""Big Time"" wrestling, jumping to WWE; a moment I'm sure a lot of people--including myself--thought would never happen. But, how long is ""never"" in the wrestling business.

As for the matches themselves, I guess I could gripe about what wasn't included--and the fact that a lot of Sting's career as ""The Crow"" from the beginning of 1998 was glossed over, I found to be curious; and as long as this collection was including matches Sting lost, why not go with Sting vs. Savage at the '98 Spring Stampede. But, the stuff WWE did go with was mostly solid--in particular, I really liked the Sting/Bret Hart match and that match itself could lead me to griping about how badly WCW handled Bret Hart.

Sting and Bret should have been a feud that was headlining Pay-Per-Views, with the ""Big Gold"" on the line--but, decades later, I guess there's no crying over the many botches WCW had post Starrcade '97.

Overall--if you're a Sting fan--then ""Into the Light"" is well worth the money....

4 1/2 stars",1445126400,9,1515,4.617100371747212
7295271,4,B00ZUNDCKM,"This Hour and 15-minute documentary was very good, one that I've been finding myself watching repeatedly. The documentary is about 50% WCW and 50% Coming to WWE. It's more like this ""Network Era"" documentary where it jumps back and forth between past stuff and current stuff, but it all blends nice. It's great to get an interview from the man himself (since the 2014 DVD failed to give us that). He talks openly about WCW, why it took him so long to come to WWE and the signing process, and even briefly mentioned TNA by name (even got some pictures from TNA in the documentary). He also talks openly about his faith. Wish there was a little more detail about WCW but overall it's still worth the buy.

The matches are once again mostly Nitro matches but this time they actually picked some much better ones (compared to the 2014 DVD). I do wish that his more popular PPV matches were not already sacrificed to the other DVD because it would make this one a real definitive collection, but still a good effort.",1445040000,,1011,4.524590163934426
7295272,5,B00ZUNDCKM,Just received it as a birthday gift love it specially the documentary part if you're a sting fan like myself you will absolutely love this,1444867200,,138,4.56
7295273,4,B00ZUNDCKM,"He was the one man from the beginning of World Championship Wrestling to the final match in the original company becoming the face of the company he never left & being the top name from the company to have no association with World Wrestling Entertainment...until 13 years later when he finally came to the company & this is a look at that journey of the man called Steve Borden & his character of Sting.  You hear the story of Sting's career & his personal life while also chronicling his first ever visit to WWE Headquarters throughout the presentation & him looking back at landmark matches from his career with seeing some of them in their entirety for the first time (Clash Of The Champions I & Great American Bash '90 & the last WCW Nitro vs. Ric Flair; Starrcade '97 vs. Hollywood Hogan).  You hear from other members of Sting's family (parents, wife, sons) along with other wrestling personalities including Jim Ross, Ric Flair, Ultimate Warrior, Jerry Jarrett, Rick Steiner, Lex Luger, Ron Simmons, Diamond Dallas Page, Eric Bischoff, Vader, Goldberg, Big Show, Scott Hall, Hulk Hogan, Tyson Kidd, Triple H, and John Cena throughout the presentation.

Normally I save my summary towards the end but I'll give it now in that I enjoyed the presentation telling his story while following him throughout his first time WWE experiences along with a look into his personal life & faith which we don't always get from superstars along with finally getting Sting's side of the story on various subjects that have been talked about in the past along with some that were never talked about before.  The only real negative I have to say is that I wish more was said about his feuds throughout his career as they talked about specific matches but his actual important feuds of his career (i.e. Vader) while the match selection wasn't perfect but satisfying.  Overall I did enjoy this presentation & I would recommend it.

The presentation beings talking about Sting's early life growing up such as what was the sport he played that would eventually help him in his wrestling career along with who inspired him to go into bodybuilding & how that played into him getting into the wrestling business before discussing his career teaming with Ultimate Warrior in different territories eventually evolving into his Sting character & coming into what would be eventually be WCW building up to his match with World Championship victory over Ric Flair.  The Sting character was discussed next from what elements appealed to the audience to how he was a locker room leader & company man followed by the differences between Sting & Steve Borden including his reasons for never leaving WCW to come to WWE before going into his evolution into into the current ""black & white"" character including what influences in & outside of the business went into his look what was his mentality behind certain elements such as no talking & surprising appearances building up to Starrcade against Hogan with the discussion finally happening for the first time on a WWE presentation of what the politics were behind the scenes leading to the infamous finish of that match.  Things get more personal here as Sting reflects on what was happening to him in the business that was effecting him outside of it & what that eventually cost him leading to his renewed faith becoming a born again Christian before going into his memories of the final WCW Nitro & why we didn't see him in WWE after the closing of the company followed by what motivated him to eventually come to WWE with the presentation coming to a close following him behind of the scenes of his debut at Survivor Series & match at WrestleMania including who he met backstage that made him feel like his career as Sting came ""full circle"" & what special event happened only a short time later for Steve Borden.

Matches Include:
The Freedom Fighters vs. David Johnson & The Invader - This was a quick squash match with both men being dominate but also very limited in what they could do easily overpowering their opponents.
""Memphis Wrestling"" Nov. '85

The Blade Runners vs. Tracey Smothers & Ricky Gibson - Another dominate showcase with the team using their power offense such as strikes & slams & clotheslines.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Mar. '86

UWF Tag Team Championship Match w/Rick Steiner vs. Brad Armstrong & Tim Horner - It should be noted that Armstrong & Horner were also known as the ""Lightning Express"" during this time while Steiner & Sting were members of ""Hot Stuff International"" managed by Eddie Gilbert while Gilbert's father was the referee for the match.  The Express took the early advantage with their superior speed & double team maneuvers while Sting & Steiner focused on singling out one opponent while using illegal tactics such as Gilbert getting involved whenever possible from the outside to the disapproval of his father as both teams traded momentum working on grounding their opponents to take away their advantage weather it was the Express' speed or Sting & Steiner's power in a competitive encounter.
""Universal Wrestling Federation"" May '87

vs. NWA Champion Ric Flair - It should be noted that Horsemen manager J.J. Dillion was suspended in a cage to prevent interference in this match while there were also 3 judges at ringside (Penthouse model Patty Mullen & NWA executives Sandy Scott & Gary Juster) to make a ruling in case the match went to a draw.  Both men were feeling each other early before Sting was able to get control staying one step ahead of Flair & constantly going back to a specific series of basic holds while also showcasing his strength with offense focusing on a specific area of the body while Flair also worked over different areas of the body with his trademark offense including chops so hard that you saw a cut on Sting's chest as they continued to trade momentum throughout this match with Flair living up to his nickname of being ""the dirtiest player in the game"" taking a shortcut whenever possible while Sting fought back including using some of Flair's own offense against him resulting in a match that made Sting a household name overnight in what has gone down as a classic encounter that has stood the test of time today.
""NWA Clash Of The Champions I"" Mar. '88
[Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection; Best Of Clash Of The Champions]

vs. Great Muta - Although their more famous series of matches happened in 1989, we got a rare gem here in a match from the WCW/New Japan Supershows both companies would do in the early 1990's. Muta took the fight right to Sting early before Sting used his strength advantage to get it back with moves such as press slamming Muta out of the ring before delivering a flying body press. Back in the ring, Sting grounded Muta before both men went back & forth and missing high risk moves such as the Stinger Splash & Muta's moonsault. In the end, Muta had to resort to his dirty tactics of using the mist but it would be Sting would leave the lasting impression.
WCW/New Japan SuperShow '91
[Wrestling's Highest Flyers]

w/Lex Luger vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers - Both teams were evenly matched as Luger showcased his power & Sting's agility while using the Steiner's own offense against them while Rick & Scott delivered a wide variety of suplexes as the match got more intense as time went on with each team gaining the advantage by taking advantage of their opponents' mistiming with each team going aerial & having counters to their offense as this ultimately came down to one team taking advantage of one opponent ""taking the bullet"" for his partner.
WCW SuperBrawl I '91
[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

Submit Or Surrender Match vs. Cactus Jack - This was a unique match for it's time as it was a combination of a Falls Count Anywhere/Submission/Last Man Standing match as the only way to win the match was by submission or knockout & the fall could take place anywhere. Cactus wore a Sting t-shirt to the ring with the brawling started on the floor with Cactus going into the guardrails & having a rubber trash can used against him to get beat on including a top rope splash before a mistiming on a leap frog by Sting allowed Cactus to take control taking the match back to the outside where he had to struggle with a fan to use a chair on Sting. They continued to trade momentum with Cactus delivering his trademark elbow onto the floor before a mistiming by Sting allowed him to take control sending Cactus off the apron onto the concrete. Mick Foley spoke before the match about how this was their best encounter throughout their initial series as they had already done everything to each other so they had to get innovative for this match including the more creative ways to use a rubber trash can & I can't disagree was this was their best match (to my memory) out of their initial series in 1991.
""WCW Power Hour"" Nov. '91
[For All Mankind: The Life & Career Of Mick Foley]

vs. Rick Rude - This was the semi-finals of the King Of Cable tournament under guidelines of a 20 minute time limit with three judges (Larry Zbyszko, Ole Anderson, Hiro Matsuda) to declare the winner in case of a draw.  Rude immediately targeted the neck area only for Sting to heavily focus on Rude's midsection with various strikes & kicks along with other offense & submissions directly effecting that area to the point where Rude was showing effects & couldn't do his trademark ""swerving hips"" but still continued to work over Sting avoiding some of his signature moves while working over his back including using some the same moves that Sting did on him earlier in the match.  Sting & Rude had a long rivarly in WCW from his debut a year earlier to his eventual injury & retirement but this was the best quality singles match they had against each other on WCW television.
As a side note, the commentary was removed from this match which is normal when it comes to Jesse Ventura but Jim Ross' was removed as well.
""WCW Clash Of The Champions XXI"" Nov. '92

WCW International Championship Match vs. Vader - Before I get started, for those who don't remember the story behind this championship...this was the ""big gold belt"" (currently referred to as the World Heavyweight Championship in WWE) that was originally the NWA Championship but when the NWA pulled out of WCW for the last time, WCW owned the belt and just renamed it but kept the status of it being a World Championship.
Now it was during this time that Sting & Rick Rude were feuding against each other for the championship with Vader waiting to face the champion at this show as Rude regained the championship in Japan but suffered a career ending neck injury causing him to forfeit the title leading to this match to declare the new champion. Vader just boxed & beat Sting down in the opening moments before Sting recovered & hit one hell of an impressive vertical suplex on Vader but hurt himself in the process as Vader used a different strategy on Sting than normal as he grounded Sting throughout the match doing moves that weren't usual for him such as a leg grapevine submission & while going more aerial than usual while Sting was able to keep knocking Vader down & to the outside along with taking advantage of any mistiming & miscommunication between Vader & Harley Race.  Sting & Vader always had good matches against each other with each match playing out different than the previous one and this was no exception.
WCW Slamboree '94
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's]

vs. Steve Austin - Both men were utilizing the same offense against each other & them either blocking or countering each other's offense along with taking some high risk as Austin attempted to work over an area of the body with strikes & submission attempts while using shortcuts when possible while Sting used Austin's own momentum against him to gain momentum in what was a pretty evenly matched contest.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Apr. '95

vs. Hulk Hogan - This was a very interesting match to say the least as this happened during Hogan's ""dark side"" period where he was wearing all black to fight the Dungeon Of Doom with Savage later joining on the ""dark side"" & wearing all black as well while Lex Luger was a member of the Dungeon Of Doom but still had an alliance with Sting causing Hogan to question Sting's loyalties leading to his first ever meeting between both men...with Sting colored in Hogan's old colors of red & yellow. It should be interesting to note that this match heavily foreshadowed Hogan's future as the ""Hollywood"" character as the crowd was completely behind Sting & booing Hogan while Hogan did ""heelish"" acts during the match such as how he entered the ring. This was a good match for what it was but as expected during this time, the Dungeon Of Doom did get involved & you saw exactly where Sting's loyalty lied.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Nov. '95
[Hulk Hogan's Unreleased Collector's Series]

WCW Tag Team Championship Match vs. WCW Tag Team Champion Giant - For those who don't know the story behind this unique match, Sting & Giant were scheduled to face Hall & Nash for the WCW Tag Titles leading into the previous PPV of Slamboree but Giant joined nWo Hollywood the week before the match as they won the tag team titles only for Sting to not join Giant in nWo Hollywood & join the nWo Wolfpack leading to this match where the winner gets possession of both tag titles because these two were unable to work together to defend the titles. Giant walked into the match smoking a cigarette & blew it in Sting's face leading to Sting to respond with a slap & attempting a ""stick & move"" offense by hitting Giant with moves like the Stinger Splash but Giant's size allowed him to block some of these attempts including Sting just bouncing off him when trying a crossbody & powering out of the Scorpion Deathlock causing Sting to resorting to dishing out extra amounts punishment to try to keep Giant down. The match was pretty short & sweet.
WCW/nWo Great American Bash '98
[nWo: The Revolution]

vs. WCW Champion Goldberg - Dallas Page was on commentary as he was set to face the champion at Halloween Havoc as both men started off intense with Goldberg delivering a snap slam & Sting responding with a tree of woe & suplex right off the bat before they traded momentum with Sting doing a dropkick but Goldberg got right back up followed by a tombstone piledriver that he openly showed effects from causing Sting to go on the heavy offense with repeated Stinger splashes & eventually applying the Scorpion Deathlock. This was a quality ""dream match"" between both men with the only thing negative to say is what happened towards the end.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Sept. '98
[Blu-Ray version of Very Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 2; Goldberg: The Definitive Collection]

vs. WCW Champion Diamond Dallas Page - Both men began by trading punches with DDP showing heel tenancies such as pulling hair, delivering a low blow & constantly going to floor whenever Sting began to build momentum. The referee let these men get away with what would usually result in a disqualification resulting in both men brawling on the outside & bouncing each other off the guardrail before Page went after Sting's knee & used the post in the process. This was a very intense & high impact match here with the crowd being very hot from start to finish with one moment to look out for being Sting giving DDP one of the nastiest looking piledrivers I've seen that made me cringe a little when I saw it. DDP said this match was one of the best in his career & I can't say I disagree.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Apr. '99
[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 1]

WCW Championship Match vs. Bret Hart - This was Bret Hart's first WCW Championship match (to my knowledge) despite being in the company for close to 2 years as Bret took the offense to Sting right away with punches & bouncing his head off various items on the floor only for Sting to resort to desperate tactics & giving a receipt using the ringside environment to his advantage as they went back & forth using their trademark offense against each other resulting in a match that got more aggressive over time.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Oct. '99
[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 3]

vs. Triple H - Both men had unique entrances (which I marked out for being a huge fan of the ""Terminator"" series) while it should be noted that this match could only be won by pinfall or submission. Both men started out having the same idea as far as attempts to take down their opponent before one man was able to get the advantage constantly stopping opponent dead from getting offense before finally being able to take advantage of a mistiming working him over in & outside of the ring before the match evolved into what Michael Cole described as ""The 'Monday Night Wars' have come to WrestleMania"" as you saw guest appearances from the two biggest factions in wrestling during that era along with a battle of ""sledgehammer vs. baseball bat"" in what told a good story as far as being the final battle of WWE vs. WCW and was entertaining for what it was.
WrestleMania XXXI
[Blu-Ray edition of The Kliq Rules]

(Blu-Ray) w/Dusty Rhodes vs. NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard - This was a classic ""faces vs. heels"" encounter as Sting & Rhodes kept getting the upper hand & dominating the Horsemen resulting in Anderson & Blanchard resorting to double teams & illegal tactics with J.J. Dillion at ringside and even Sting on the receiving end of a DDT on the floor. This was a back & forth match with the crowd hot from start to finish but this match did it's job in establishing matches & feuds going into the ""Great American Bash"" PPV the next month.
""Clash Of The Champions II"" June '88
[The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story; Best Of Clash Of The Champions]

(Blu-Ray) vs. Scott Steiner - Sting was currently one half of the WCW Tag Team Champions while Scott was a top contender with his brother Rick as both men showcased their strength against each other early on with both of them going aerial & using a variety of suplexes & submissions throughout the match in what was a solid contest.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" May '96

(Blu-Ray) vs. Booker - This was a first round match in the one night tournament for the vacant WCW United States Championship with Sting representing the ""Millionaires Club"" & Booker as part of the ""New Blood"" with Sting taking control early with intensity as the match went to the floor with a cameraman getting taken out in the process while both men used the announce table to their advantage before settling back in the ring with Booker delivering his various styles of kicks while Sting was able to counter & reverse Booker's offense on more than one occasion coming down to the winner being the one man who was able to catch the other in a non-stop fast paced match.

In the end, I already gave my summary in the beginning but as I said, I recommend this for fans of any fan of WCW or the man himself in Sting.",1444780800,,20028,4.668840374255741
7295274,4,B00ZUNDCKM,"He was the one man from the beginning of World Championship Wrestling to the final match in the original company becoming the face of the company he never left & being the top name from the company to have no association with World Wrestling Entertainment...until 13 years later when he finally came to the company & this is a look at that journey of the man called Steve Borden & his character of Sting.  You hear the story of Sting's career & his personal life while also chronicling his first ever visit to WWE Headquarters throughout the presentation & him looking back at landmark matches from his career with seeing some of them in their entirety for the first time (Clash Of The Champions I & Great American Bash '90 & the last WCW Nitro vs. Ric Flair; Starrcade '97 vs. Hollywood Hogan).  You hear from other members of Sting's family (parents, wife, sons) along with other wrestling personalities including Jim Ross, Ric Flair, Ultimate Warrior, Jerry Jarrett, Rick Steiner, Lex Luger, Ron Simmons, Diamond Dallas Page, Eric Bischoff, Vader, Goldberg, Big Show, Scott Hall, Hulk Hogan, Tyson Kidd, Triple H, and John Cena throughout the presentation.

Normally I save my summary towards the end but I'll give it now in that I enjoyed the presentation telling his story while following him throughout his first time WWE experiences along with a look into his personal life & faith which we don't always get from superstars along with finally getting Sting's side of the story on various subjects that have been talked about in the past along with some that were never talked about before.  The only real negative I have to say is that I wish more was said about his feuds throughout his career as they talked about specific matches but his actual important feuds of his career (i.e. Vader) while the match selection wasn't perfect but satisfying.  Overall I did enjoy this presentation & I would recommend it.

The presentation beings talking about Sting's early life growing up such as what was the sport he played that would eventually help him in his wrestling career along with who inspired him to go into bodybuilding & how that played into him getting into the wrestling business before discussing his career teaming with Ultimate Warrior in different territories eventually evolving into his Sting character & coming into what would be eventually be WCW building up to his match with World Championship victory over Ric Flair.  The Sting character was discussed next from what elements appealed to the audience to how he was a locker room leader & company man followed by the differences between Sting & Steve Borden including his reasons for never leaving WCW to come to WWE before going into his evolution into into the current ""black & white"" character including what influences in & outside of the business went into his look what was his mentality behind certain elements such as no talking & surprising appearances building up to Starrcade against Hogan with the discussion finally happening for the first time on a WWE presentation of what the politics were behind the scenes leading to the infamous finish of that match.  Things get more personal here as Sting reflects on what was happening to him in the business that was effecting him outside of it & what that eventually cost him leading to his renewed faith becoming a born again Christian before going into his memories of the final WCW Nitro & why we didn't see him in WWE after the closing of the company followed by what motivated him to eventually come to WWE with the presentation coming to a close following him behind of the scenes of his debut at Survivor Series & match at WrestleMania including who he met backstage that made him feel like his career as Sting came ""full circle"" & what special event happened only a short time later for Steve Borden.

Matches Include:
The Freedom Fighters vs. David Johnson & The Invader - This was a quick squash match with both men being dominate but also very limited in what they could do easily overpowering their opponents.
""Memphis Wrestling"" Nov. '85

The Blade Runners vs. Tracey Smothers & Ricky Gibson - Another dominate showcase with the team using their power offense such as strikes & slams & clotheslines.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Mar. '86

UWF Tag Team Championship Match w/Rick Steiner vs. Brad Armstrong & Tim Horner - It should be noted that Armstrong & Horner were also known as the ""Lightning Express"" during this time while Steiner & Sting were members of ""Hot Stuff International"" managed by Eddie Gilbert while Gilbert's father was the referee for the match.  The Express took the early advantage with their superior speed & double team maneuvers while Sting & Steiner focused on singling out one opponent while using illegal tactics such as Gilbert getting involved whenever possible from the outside to the disapproval of his father as both teams traded momentum working on grounding their opponents to take away their advantage weather it was the Express' speed or Sting & Steiner's power in a competitive encounter.
""Universal Wrestling Federation"" May '87

vs. NWA Champion Ric Flair - It should be noted that Horsemen manager J.J. Dillion was suspended in a cage to prevent interference in this match while there were also 3 judges at ringside (Penthouse model Patty Mullen & NWA executives Sandy Scott & Gary Juster) to make a ruling in case the match went to a draw.  Both men were feeling each other early before Sting was able to get control staying one step ahead of Flair & constantly going back to a specific series of basic holds while also showcasing his strength with offense focusing on a specific area of the body while Flair also worked over different areas of the body with his trademark offense including chops so hard that you saw a cut on Sting's chest as they continued to trade momentum throughout this match with Flair living up to his nickname of being ""the dirtiest player in the game"" taking a shortcut whenever possible while Sting fought back including using some of Flair's own offense against him resulting in a match that made Sting a household name overnight in what has gone down as a classic encounter that has stood the test of time today.

vs. Great Muta - Although their more famous series of matches happened in 1989, we got a rare gem here in a match from the WCW/New Japan Supershows both companies would do in the early 1990's. Muta took the fight right to Sting early before Sting used his strength advantage to get it back with moves such as press slamming Muta out of the ring before delivering a flying body press. Back in the ring, Sting grounded Muta before both men went back & forth and missing high risk moves such as the Stinger Splash & Muta's moonsault. In the end, Muta had to resort to his dirty tactics of using the mist but it would be Sting would leave the lasting impression.

w/Lex Luger vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers - Both teams were evenly matched as Luger showcased his power & Sting's agility while using the Steiner's own offense against them while Rick & Scott delivered a wide variety of suplexes as the match got more intense as time went on with each team gaining the advantage by taking advantage of their opponents' mistiming with each team going aerial & having counters to their offense as this ultimately came down to one team taking advantage of one opponent ""taking the bullet"" for his partner.

[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

Submit Or Surrender Match vs. Cactus Jack - This was a unique match for it's time as it was a combination of a Falls Count Anywhere/Submission/Last Man Standing match as the only way to win the match was by submission or knockout & the fall could take place anywhere. Cactus wore a Sting t-shirt to the ring with the brawling started on the floor with Cactus going into the guardrails & having a rubber trash can used against him to get beat on including a top rope splash before a mistiming on a leap frog by Sting allowed Cactus to take control taking the match back to the outside where he had to struggle with a fan to use a chair on Sting. They continued to trade momentum with Cactus delivering his trademark elbow onto the floor before a mistiming by Sting allowed him to take control sending Cactus off the apron onto the concrete. Mick Foley spoke before the match about how this was their best encounter throughout their initial series as they had already done everything to each other so they had to get innovative for this match including the more creative ways to use a rubber trash can & I can't disagree was this was their best match (to my memory) out of their initial series in 1991.

vs. Rick Rude - This was the semi-finals of the King Of Cable tournament under guidelines of a 20 minute time limit with three judges (Larry Zbyszko, Ole Anderson, Hiro Matsuda) to declare the winner in case of a draw.  Rude immediately targeted the neck area only for Sting to heavily focus on Rude's midsection with various strikes & kicks along with other offense & submissions directly effecting that area to the point where Rude was showing effects & couldn't do his trademark ""swerving hips"" but still continued to work over Sting avoiding some of his signature moves while working over his back including using some the same moves that Sting did on him earlier in the match.  Sting & Rude had a long rivarly in WCW from his debut a year earlier to his eventual injury & retirement but this was the best quality singles match they had against each other on WCW television.
As a side note, the commentary was removed from this match which is normal when it comes to Jesse Ventura but Jim Ross' was removed as well.
""WCW Clash Of The Champions XXI"" Nov. '92

WCW International Championship Match vs. Vader - Before I get started, for those who don't remember the story behind this championship...this was the ""big gold belt"" (currently referred to as the World Heavyweight Championship in WWE) that was originally the NWA Championship but when the NWA pulled out of WCW for the last time, WCW owned the belt and just renamed it but kept the status of it being a World Championship.
Now it was during this time that Sting & Rick Rude were feuding against each other for the championship with Vader waiting to face the champion at this show as Rude regained the championship in Japan but suffered a career ending neck injury causing him to forfeit the title leading to this match to declare the new champion. Vader just boxed & beat Sting down in the opening moments before Sting recovered & hit one hell of an impressive vertical suplex on Vader but hurt himself in the process as Vader used a different strategy on Sting than normal as he grounded Sting throughout the match doing moves that weren't usual for him such as a leg grapevine submission & while going more aerial than usual while Sting was able to keep knocking Vader down & to the outside along with taking advantage of any mistiming & miscommunication between Vader & Harley Race.  Sting & Vader always had good matches against each other with each match playing out different than the previous one and this was no exception.
WCW Slamboree '94
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's]

vs. Steve Austin - Both men were utilizing the same offense against each other & them either blocking or countering each other's offense along with taking some high risk as Austin attempted to work over an area of the body with strikes & submission attempts while using shortcuts when possible while Sting used Austin's own momentum against him to gain momentum in what was a pretty evenly matched contest.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Apr. '95

vs. Hulk Hogan - This was a very interesting match to say the least as this happened during Hogan's ""dark side"" period where he was wearing all black to fight the Dungeon Of Doom with Savage later joining on the ""dark side"" & wearing all black as well while Lex Luger was a member of the Dungeon Of Doom but still had an alliance with Sting causing Hogan to question Sting's loyalties leading to his first ever meeting between both men...with Sting colored in Hogan's old colors of red & yellow. It should be interesting to note that this match heavily foreshadowed Hogan's future as the ""Hollywood"" character as the crowd was completely behind Sting & booing Hogan while Hogan did ""heelish"" acts during the match such as how he entered the ring. This was a good match for what it was but as expected during this time, the Dungeon Of Doom did get involved & you saw exactly where Sting's loyalty lied.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Nov. '95
[Hulk Hogan's Unreleased Collector's Series]

WCW Tag Team Championship Match vs. WCW Tag Team Champion Giant - For those who don't know the story behind this unique match, Sting & Giant were scheduled to face Hall & Nash for the WCW Tag Titles leading into the previous PPV of Slamboree but Giant joined nWo Hollywood the week before the match as they won the tag team titles only for Sting to not join Giant in nWo Hollywood & join the nWo Wolfpack leading to this match where the winner gets possession of both tag titles because these two were unable to work together to defend the titles. Giant walked into the match smoking a cigarette & blew it in Sting's face leading to Sting to respond with a slap & attempting a ""stick & move"" offense by hitting Giant with moves like the Stinger Splash but Giant's size allowed him to block some of these attempts including Sting just bouncing off him when trying a crossbody & powering out of the Scorpion Deathlock causing Sting to resorting to dishing out extra amounts punishment to try to keep Giant down. The match was pretty short & sweet.

vs. WCW Champion Goldberg - Dallas Page was on commentary as he was set to face the champion at Halloween Havoc as both men started off intense with Goldberg delivering a snap slam & Sting responding with a tree of woe & suplex right off the bat before they traded momentum with Sting doing a dropkick but Goldberg got right back up followed by a tombstone piledriver that he openly showed effects from causing Sting to go on the heavy offense with repeated Stinger splashes & eventually applying the Scorpion Deathlock. This was a quality ""dream match"" between both men with the only thing negative to say is what happened towards the end.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Sept. '98

vs. WCW Champion Diamond Dallas Page - Both men began by trading punches with DDP showing heel tenancies such as pulling hair, delivering a low blow & constantly going to floor whenever Sting began to build momentum. The referee let these men get away with what would usually result in a disqualification resulting in both men brawling on the outside & bouncing each other off the guardrail before Page went after Sting's knee & used the post in the process. This was a very intense & high impact match here with the crowd being very hot from start to finish with one moment to look out for being Sting giving DDP one of the nastiest looking piledrivers I've seen that made me cringe a little when I saw it. DDP said this match was one of the best in his career & I can't say I disagree.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Apr. '99
[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 1]

WCW Championship Match vs. Bret Hart - This was Bret Hart's first WCW Championship match (to my knowledge) despite being in the company for close to 2 years as Bret took the offense to Sting right away with punches & bouncing his head off various items on the floor only for Sting to resort to desperate tactics & giving a receipt using the ringside environment to his advantage as they went back & forth using their trademark offense against each other resulting in a match that got more aggressive over time.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Oct. '99
[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 3]

vs. Triple H - Both men had unique entrances (which I marked out for being a huge fan of the ""Terminator"" series) while it should be noted that this match could only be won by pinfall or submission. Both men started out having the same idea as far as attempts to take down their opponent before one man was able to get the advantage constantly stopping opponent dead from getting offense before finally being able to take advantage of a mistiming working him over in & outside of the ring before the match evolved into what Michael Cole described as ""The 'Monday Night Wars' have come to WrestleMania"" as you saw guest appearances from the two biggest factions in wrestling during that era along with a battle of ""sledgehammer vs. baseball bat"" in what told a good story as far as being the final battle of WWE vs. WCW and was entertaining for what it was.
WrestleMania XXXI
[Blu-Ray edition of The Kliq Rules]

(Blu-Ray) w/Dusty Rhodes vs. NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard - This was a classic ""faces vs. heels"" encounter as Sting & Rhodes kept getting the upper hand & dominating the Horsemen resulting in Anderson & Blanchard resorting to double teams & illegal tactics with J.J. Dillion at ringside and even Sting on the receiving end of a DDT on the floor. This was a back & forth match with the crowd hot from start to finish but this match did it's job in establishing matches & feuds going into the ""Great American Bash"" PPV the next month.
""Clash Of The Champions II"" June '88

(Blu-Ray) vs. Scott Steiner - Sting was currently one half of the WCW Tag Team Champions while Scott was a top contender with his brother Rick as both men showcased their strength against each other early on with both of them going aerial & using a variety of suplexes & submissions throughout the match in what was a solid contest.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" May '96

(Blu-Ray) vs. Booker - This was a first round match in the one night tournament for the vacant WCW United States Championship with Sting representing the ""Millionaires Club"" & Booker as part of the ""New Blood"" with Sting taking control early with intensity as the match went to the floor with a cameraman getting taken out in the process while both men used the announce table to their advantage before settling back in the ring with Booker delivering his various styles of kicks while Sting was able to counter & reverse Booker's offense on more than one occasion coming down to the winner being the one man who was able to catch the other in a non-stop fast paced match.

In the end, I already gave my summary in the beginning but as I said, I recommend this for fans of any fan of WCW or the man himself in Sting.",1444780800,4,20028,4.668840374255741
7295275,4,B00ZUNDCKM,"I only watched the documentary part of this which was 1 hour 15 minutes of Sting talking about his career,and a camera crew following him into his lead up to Wrestlemania for his match against HHH.  It was a very interesting behind the scenes, more personal than the other dvd I watched from last year called Best of Sting as you get to hear from his parents, kids and even shows him getting married for a brief section at the end. I respect him because he is not afraid to talk about the personal battles he has had with fame, his mistakes, or his belief in Jesus. A humble down to earth guy who seems to be genuinely nice, This is why he is my favourite wrestler.

The other part of this dvd is the usual WWE offering on these types of thing, showing a selection of matches from his career starting with his tag team partner Ultimate warrior and ending with his Wrestlmania match against HHH. There is over 5 hours 30 minutes of his matches on here. A bit more behind the scenes stuff would have been welcomed , I find it fascinating to see what goes on with the politics and private lives of the people in this industry.",1444521600,4,1123,4.2924528301886795
7295276,5,B00ZUNDCKM,"This is definitely a DVD I'm looking forward to. I've been a fan since 1988, following the Stinger through the NWA, WCW and TNA and now into WWE. This should be a nice companion to the Best of Sting DVD, released last year. Like that release, it will feature a mixture of greatest matches and some obscure ones. Personally, I'm looking forward to the documentary on this disc, as WWE does some excellent documentaries on their biggest releases, and since Sting is the greatest ever, this should be no different. I'm going to get the Blu-Ray as it will have more interviews and matches, and because, well, that's just how I roll.

Later he wouldn't sign again for me, so I don't like him now. don't buy this dvd. it will only support his claims of celebrity. i feel as though the signature should be a direct result of anyones celebrity. if they don't sign, strip them of their manhood. revolt against the Tootus Card Infractor.",1444262400,,472,4.141304347826087

His match vs HHH was a dream match-love it! I remember old school Sting with the blonde hair (my personal favorite version) and later his transformation into the black baseball bat toting crow character. A huge enigma with more charisma than he knew what to do with. I was never a huge WCW fan but always respected and admired Sting. This dvd has a lot of matches I've never seen or remember but helps me make up for lost time. I loved the rivalry with Bret Hart & Goldberg during the Monday Night Wars competing against Monday Night Raw. This is a must have for any hard core fan and must see for any unfamiliar wrestling fan who knows little to nothing about the man himself.",1529107200,,822,4.450331125827814
