I especially love the flying sequences and the massive train wreck a couple episodes into the series. I'm a huge fan and as a resident of the town where it was filmed, wish I had some part in telling this story. I hope to see news about season 2 very soon!",1324771200,2,372,4.109589041095891
8494374,5,B0067PIKOK,"I have been a fan of Aidan 5 from the get-go. I was first exposed to it back in Gen Con in 2009, where they aired their first episode. I was hooked and captivated before the first episode even ended. Bryan Michael Block and Maya Sayre do a great job portraying their characters, Detectives Aidan and Riley. The writers keep you guessing with every episode and leaves you dying to know more every time an episode ends. It is told in a ""film noir"" style, with black and white sketches that come to life with live action acting. Kind of like a comic/graphic novel with real actors. It's riveting, captivating, mind blowing and innovative. Everyone I have recommended it to or shown, has loved it. The extra features were interesting as well, and definitely worth taking a look at. I highly recommend buying this and watching it! You won't be disappointed.",1323216000,5,852,4.6490066225165565
8494375,5,B0067PIKOK,"I've been following the webseries from the beginning and I loved this. From the lead actors Bryan Michael Block and Maya Sayre giving great performances to the uniquer pencil sketch style art direction, this DVD rocks. The extras are plentiful with FX demos and interviews, so this is almost got a Greenscreen Film School aspect to it. Commentary tracks are interesting, but the real juice is just the overall story arc. Each episode ends in a cliffhanger as an homage to the old style short serials of days long gone, but incredibly well done here. AIDAN 5 rocks. Dig it.",1321574400,6,572,4.73
