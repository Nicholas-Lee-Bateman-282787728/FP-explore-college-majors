2651125,2,B000I2J6KA,"Winston Churchill is an historical figure who I admire greatly. I have read his books and books written about him during various periods of his life. In that regard, ""Churchill: A Life"" written by Sir Martin Gilbert is one of the best and most informative. When I saw this advertised on Amazon.com, I was very interested in learning about Mr. Churchill from another perspective, that being from the man who was assigned to guard him. I expected to discover new insights about Sir Winston, instead I was presented with anecdotes and casual observations. It was a waste of my time.",1354665600,,579,4.8
2651126,5,B000I2J6KA,"I bought this documentary series because it was done by the same people who made ""Hitler's Bodyguard"".

I found ""Churchill's Bodyguard"" to be entertaining and educational.  Learn things about Winston Churchill from the man who was tasked with protecting him for many years.",1301097600,2,273,5.325581395348837
2651127,5,B000I2J6KA,"Very entertaining series based closely on Sir Walter's full memoirs which were published in 2005 by Tom Hickman.  Not 100% historically accurate - if you want a full understanding read Randolph Churchill and Martin Gilbert's biography of Churchill and Churchill's important works; The Story of the Malakand Field Force, The River War, London to Ladysmith via Pretoria/Ian Hamilton's March, The World Crisis, The Second World War, My Early Life and Marlborough.

Now to the main point of my review; go to Amazon.co.uk and buy the DVD series 'Churchill's Bodyguard' for less than 5 pounds instead of US$50.  You don't even need a new account as you just use your Amazon.com account and even with the little extra money it takes to ship it you will still save at least US40.  I have been using Amazon internationally for many years and I have found it always pays to check Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.com and if I am looking for rare or OOP books/films etc I will also look at Amazon in France and Germany.  Again I can just use my regular Amazon account.

Something else for Churchill aficionados; St Augustine Press is releasing a beautiful 2 vol., unabridged pre-1903 version of 'The River War'.  Only 2000 copies of the full, unbridged version were ever published and even Churchill scholars are mostly unfamiliar with the unabridged version which includes Churchill's thoughts on Islamic fundamentalism and his controversial judgements of his superiors including Kitchener.  Whilst the expected release date is mid-November 2010, I should mention that its release date has already been postponed more than half a dozen times since 2005.  Here are the details;

The River War
An Historical Account of the Reconquest of the Soudan
Winston S. Churchill

Originally published in two volumes in 1899, The River War has been out of print in its original, unabridged version since it was shortened to one volume in 1902. Only 3,000 copies were printed, and the first edition costs thousands of dollars today. The original version abounded in colorful stories about Churchill, controversial judgments on his contemporaries (especially his commanding officer, Lord Kitchener), and thoughts on Islamic fundamentalism and British imperialism. Because they were left out of every subsequent edition, they are all but unknown today, even to scholars. The 1899 edition was illustrated with drawings, photogravures, and colored maps that disappeared with the 1902 abridgment.

The new St. Augustine's Press edition includes the entire text of the original edition,
returned to print for the first time since the book was abridged. It also includes all
material added or altered in later editions of the book. New appendices add a definitive new edition of Churchill's newspaper dispatches from the Sudan, based for the first time on his original manuscripts, as well as Churchill's other writings on the Sudan from 1898 to 1958.

The new edition has a new foreword by Churchill's only surviving child, Lady
Soames, who is a noted writer in her own right. Editor James W. Muller's more than
fifteen years of research adds thousands of new footnotes identifying people who figure in The River War, explaining Churchill's references to other books and events, tracking down the original dispatches and illustrations, and establishing a text that encompasses all variations in previous editions. These elements distinguish the new edition from any other and make it the definitive version of The River War for all time.

St. Augustine's Press will publish the two-volume set, slipcased, with a binding to
match the 1899 edition. The outer slipcase will be illustrated, and the books will have the unique endpapers. All of the original drawings, photogravures, and colored maps will be included, along with a separately bound facsimile samples of Churchill's original manuscript dispatches and chapters.

A definitive new edition, edited and with an introduction by James W. Muller (University of Alaska)
New foreword by Lady Soames (Churchill's only surviving child); Published in association with the Churchill Ctr. ca. 1350 pages, 6"" x 9"", two-volume slipcased edition, clothbound, $150.00 sp (85.00)
ISBN: 978-1-58731-700-2
new and definitive critical edition, two volumes,slipcased, two-color printing throughout,colored map sections, many line drawings and photogravures, separate booklet of Churchill's war correspondence included in facsimile, foreword, introduction, footnotes,appendices, bibliography, index world rights in English",1287273600,7,4519,5.426533523537803
2651128,2,B000I2J6KA,"This documentary shows me I've become spoiled with modern production value, but you can't blame the producers here.  This thing is really old.  It is mildly interesting for Churchill buffs, has some neat film cuts, but it is otherwise very over-dramaticized and superficial. Not a real historical record, I learned very little about Churchill and the time period.  I'm sorry I bought it.",1261094400,5,387,5.111111111111111
2651129,5,B000I2J6KA,Very interesting production featuring lots of information I haven't encountered before.  Surely Churchhill and Thompson were meant to come together at this perilous time!  Good production values.  First rate!,1246406400,6,208,6.103448275862069
2651130,3,B000I2J6KA,"Good watching and interesting. Probably need to view it again to gain full impact. Best to watch the various segments at intervals, rather than all at once. Otherwise, there can be a ""sameness"" about the whole thing.",1237939200,4,216,4.864864864864865
2651131,2,B000I2J6KA,"Interesting information spread out over too many sessions.  The first two episodes in particular have a paucity of story line and pictures to work with and the hype for what we we're about to be told amounts to way more than the telling itself. In every session, the modern color footage interspursed with the black and white original is all blurred so that it makes your eyes ache to watch it. We are shown the legs and feet of two actors walking along the street a number of times in every session, as well as a pen writing the last lines on a piece of paper (it is supposed to be Walter writing in his memoirs.) Occasionally we get a map with a journey shown in a snaking red line, which is sometimes helpful, sometimes confusing, and often repeated.  When we are shown an old photograph, the camera usually focuses on the person's stomach and slowly pans up to the face, and really their stomachs are not at all interesting. Sometimes confusing newsreels are included that are connected to Churchill only in a round-about fashion, such as riots in India when he was in New York.  The subject matter deserves better treatment.",1200009600,22,1129,4.579207920792079
2651132,5,B000I2J6KA,"The title may lead you to believe that this is a biography of an obscure Scotland Yard detective.  The videos are much more.  They are a unique biography of Winston during his adult life with emphasis on his 1920-1945 period.  They also contain large amounts of history of the countries occupied by Britain. It contains hours of newsreel coverage of his activities with narative which describes things that are not mentioned by book writers.  I prize this set of DVDs with the same passion for my book collection of Gilbert biographies.

Some more information to improve your appreciation of the program series, back around 1990 the US government released the Venona code word decripts of the code breaking efforts in the war.  It was revealed that the top three advisors to president Roosevelt were Soviet agents.  This explains how the US encouraged the Soviets to occupt Eastern Europe as they would not be challenged.",1185148800,35,921,4.941558441558442
2651177,4,B000I2J6KA,"Initially I thought there was something wrong with my computers sound settings, probably to do with the makers own super dynamic music settings and all thatbut it wasn't that. I also tried the DVD in another machine and the same problem. The soundtrack is loud then soft, loud then soft. For those who are familiar with compressor limiters, you will know what I mean. This is a manufacturing problem and may explain why Amazon currently doesn't have this title streamable on Prime. Its certainly very annoying and is present throughout the entire disc set.

But the content was good enough to warrant I stay the course. Plenty of new footage I hadn't seen before and I have dozens of WWII history sets from both sides of the ocean.

I am British, btw and so are very familiar with both British narrators Robert Powell and Denis Waterman. Robert Powell has a most marvelous voice and he narrates a few of my other box sets. I can listen to him for hours. Dennis Waterman plays the voice of Walter H. Thompson, but I keep seeing Terry McCann (Minder) every time he speaks, which was a bit off-putting.
Something else about the production of this dvd is that every time they cut-away from either real footage or their staged reenactments, they would cut to blurred footage or stills. Its not a pretty effect and it was used far too often with no point.

Anyway, well worth the purchase. Probably won't watch it again though.",1415923200,3,1421,4.653386454183267
2651178,5,B000I2J6KA,It is always interesting to know what happened behind the scenes during the war. I am always  fascinated to find out what was going on. This account of the war filled in the blanks  that i had about the middle east .,1408406400,,216,4.119047619047619
2651179,5,B000I2J6KA,I enjoyed watching this documentary from the perspective of Churchill's constant companion and bodyguard.  I am a history enthusiast and especially WW2 and the players in the process.  Definitely worth the time and $ to watch this if you are interested in Churchill.,1398988800,,266,5.162790697674419
2651180,5,B000I2J6KA,Great program.  I learned details I never knew before. The program was well made by the producers.  I have great respect for Churchill and his loyal bodyguard  Walter Thompson.,1393372800,,176,5.0
2651181,5,B000I2J6KA,"I have read Inspector Thompson's books and the video provides a lot more information. As a long time member of the Churchill Centre and Museum (formerly International Churchill Society) I found the DVD's full of information that normally doesn't appear in all of the history books. I have been teaching Continuing Education courses about Churchill's life for the past 2 years and information from this series has helped me supplement my course curriculum with loads of hard to find details of Thompson's time guarding Churchill.
I have read other reviews some critical of the DVD with its sometimes fuzzy pictures and shots of people stomachs and feet - but if you are really into the history of Churchill's life this is easily overlooked. I was more interested in the ""meat and potatoes"" and  Churchill's Bodyguard provides it!
I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in Winston Churchill! A lot of good information!",1392163200,6,927,5.01948051948052
2651182,1,B000I2J6KA,"I bought this series, but regret the purchase.  The series is out of historical sequence, repetitive and very,very dull.  The bodyguard seems like a cartoon character.",1390953600,,167,5.384615384615385
2651183,4,B000I2J6KA,"I've seen a couple of episodes of Churchill's Bodyguard. I found it interesting. The story revolves around the British prime minister's perennial bodyguard, Walter H Thompson (Walter for short) and the almost innumerable attempts to assassinate Churchill. Occasionally, the story is humorous, with Churchill recklessly standing on a roof top, longing to see German V1 rockets at close range. Walter must have worked overtime to save the British war leader from himself! One episode deals with the Nazi-Iranian conspiracy to kill Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin at the Tehran Conference.

It seems some other reviewers weren't as satisfied with the series as I was. After all, most of the material shown consists of stills of Winston, Walter and other prominent politicians or military men, plus a lot of maps. Well, it's a historical documentary, guys, not a Hollywood flick. Want some action? Go watch Inglourious Basterds, ha ha. Or start a new world war",1389484800,5,956,5.248366013071895
2651184,5,B000I2J6KA,"This was an amazing docudrama about keeping Churchill safe before and during WWII.  I have always been a big fan of Churchill and after watching this docudrama I even think more highly now of Churchill.  There was nothing fake about Churchill what the public saw was the real man even when he was alone with no one around.  I guess that is what made him such a great leader, he didn't say what he thought people wanted to hear he said what he thought people needed to know and he did make enemies doing this. You may not always agree with his opinions but you have to love a man how has such strong character.  With that said I was shocked at how many times Churchill's life was in danger and how hard it was to protect him.  I don't want to give anything away but if you like to study this era of history then this is something you should watch.  I'm even going to purchase the book and there is another book that was mentioned in the docudrama that I'm going to purchase as well.",1384992000,6,981,4.219251336898396
2651185,3,B000I2J6KA,"Thompson's memoirs are good material but many episodes repeat much of what has already been said in earlier ones. Perhaps to spread the episodes out and sell more DVDs? The modern color footage used to interspace black & white footage is badly blurred. Whether simply poorly done or a misguided attempt to ""match"" the earlier footage. The black & white footage is also not original but badly copied from multi-generation copies with no attempt to try digital restoration. It was also filmed by someone who knew little or nothing of history. Dialog tells of Thompson checking his revolver while the film has a hand holding a .45 automatic. Would benefit from a decent editor.",1366588800,3,674,4.921052631578948
2651186,5,B000I2J6KA,"Packed with history and interesting detail, this documentary series is an interesting and captivating way to learn a great deal about some of the most seminal and defining moments of 20th Century history, and learn too,about the political icons. Very informative and enjoyable way to learn.",1365811200,4,290,5.326086956521739

8143259,5,B000I2J6KA,"This is absolutely wonderful. I have watched the entire 4 discs several times. There is so much detail that we never knew. Sitting through the introduction each time is a bit boring but then it was made as a series for TV so that's to be expected. I find it a treasure trove of information about both Churchill and WWII. Was disappointed in some of the details I discovered about FDR, but then nobody's perfect and he was the man for the job at the time.",1498780800,,454,4.290697674418604

8143263,5,B000I2J6KA,Churchill's involvement and action are very well documented.  The account was most educational.  I enjoyed and also appreciated it very much.,1466726400,,141,5.666666666666667
8143264,5,B000I2J6KA,"I love this series. I borrowed it and loved it SO much I bought it. Some of the criticisms such as grainy unfocused staged footage are valid. HOWEVER, a lot of what takes place is between the 2 men or in other places, like air flights where there is no footage. What to do? Well they chose to approximate video of what was going on. Especially they use the devices of Walter writing in his diary.
It works best as an audio piece.",1464220800,,429,4.180722891566265
