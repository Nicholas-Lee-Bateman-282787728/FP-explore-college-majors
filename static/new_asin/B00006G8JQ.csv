1752815,4,B00006G8JQ,"This film is a hodgepodge of rich characters and twisting plots and sub-plots. The mood the film stets is earie, funny and hypnotic. This movie grabbed me from the oppening scene and dragged me by the ankle to the explosive ending. I dug it.",1031788800,5,241,4.5
1752856,5,B00006G8JQ,"If you enjoy 'indie-films', this is a good one. A new twist on the old plot ""crime gone FUBAR"".  It's a movie about friendship too, in a way. From whatever point you choose to view this film, it's got some funny moments that make you think about friends and family .... and strangers you may run into .... hard to describe, but recommended for a good time.",1312934400,,356,4.313432835820896
1752857,2,B00006G8JQ,"It's a shame that many of the titles, have not translated into Spanish, and not even subtitles. It would sell more if the producers had in mind, this little detail.",1277683200,,164,4.5
1752858,5,B00006G8JQ,"Loved this movie - it's a quirky little piece of magic, with a definitely unexpected ending and excellent performances throughout.  The writing is very tight, and the characters are both accessible and complex on deeper levels.",1044489600,2,227,5.305555555555555
1752859,4,B00006G8JQ,This movie was a total surprise. I had never heard of it but decided to give it a try. It's funny & pointed. It has the best parts of RESERVIOR DOGS but is also an original. The movie is smart thematically and a blast to watch. The dialogue moves fast in the vein of David Mamet & the plot has as many twists as his best work.,1043193600,,326,3.8805970149253732
1752860,4,B00006G8JQ,"ok, so here we have a bunch of hot guys, diamonds and guns. can it get any better? i don't think so. this movie makes you laugh while at the same time keeps you at the edge of your seat with clenched fists and curled toes in nervous excitement. what makes this a great movie? well, besides what i already mentioned, it has some great quotables, now that's important. Enjoy!",1039824000,2,373,4.3428571428571425
1752861,4,B00006G8JQ,"This movie has the right amount of tension and comedy, that is if you like that dark comedic approach. Well, who doesn't? The title doesn't really do it for me, but the content of the movie certainly makes up for it. What's better than four hot guys with guns and diamonds? Nothing, really. Just when you think you have the plot figured out, they throw you a curveball, keeping your fists clenched, your toes curled and you...on the edge of the couch. Grab a beer or two and enjoy!",1038009600,,481,4.415730337078652
1752862,5,B00006G8JQ,Fish in a Barrel is a great new release!  The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and continues to keep you in suspense.  It's a nice change from the usual shoot-em-up movie.,1033776000,,179,4.085714285714285
1752863,5,B00006G8JQ,"I didn't know what to expect when i went to see this movie.  I was totally engrossed from beginning to end.  A great mix of  fascinating, off-the-wall characters.....and great use of music with the action and comedy!  Five Thumbs up!!!",1033171200,,235,4.8
1752864,5,B00006G8JQ,"I loved this movie.  My boyfriend got a copy of it from the NY Independent Film Festival, because it won all these awards and he made me watch it with him.  At first I wasn't in the mood to watch some boy movie, but I was immediately converted during the opening scene.  (Nice opening scene, by the way!)  That I can be laughing hysterically while bullets are flying and that they manage to weave a love story into the middle of it all just makes me want to know what this writer/director's next film is...
Move over Quentin T. and Guy Ritchie.",1032393600,6,544,4.303921568627451
1752865,4,B00006G8JQ,"This was a reeally cool surprise. It was a great mix of comedy and drama, and the attitude and tone kept you in the characters' bizarre frame of mind. The director and lead actor is going to develop a rep as the zen master of the underworld. The other leads were great as well. This is worth a look if you want great comedy and tense drama; a kind of bizarre marriage of ""Friends"" and ""The Seven Sammuri"".",1031961600,2,405,4.205128205128205

7968200,5,B00006G8JQ,I love the movies always adding to my collection,1404864000,,48,4.444444444444445
7968201,5,B00006G8JQ,"I had been looking for the 'Fish in a Barrel' dvd for weeks as I'm a Jeremy Renner fan and knew about this movie which sounded hilarious. I found out how difficult it was to find this dvd as it is a couple of years old and pretty rare. I came on Amazon and managed to find a used copy. After waiting a couple of weeks I received it in excellent condition and was thrilled to find I could watch it, due to the dvd region issues. I am extremely happy with my dvd and with the service of both Amazon and the seller. Amazon was the only place I could find this dvd and I am extremely happy that I did. Very fast service and very high quality 'used' dvd.",1370908800,,649,3.9618320610687023
7968202,5,B00006G8JQ,"The movie synopsis is four inept thieves steal 4 million dollars in diamonds and kill a policeman. They lay low, wait until they can fence the jewels and split the cash. Simple and run of the mill. Not quite. One is paranoid, one is a drunk, one is a manic depressive and the fourth is a free spirit just trying to live his life. This coupled with a crooked cop and a sexy thief both after the diamonds you get something with a Inspector Clouseu flavor. For an indie film, it's good, just takes a bit to get going but once it does it is funny.",1366761600,,543,4.132075471698113
7968203,4,B00006G8JQ,"I really liked the tone of the movie. It was fun and I enjoyed the dark humor. I wish my favorite character lasted longer, but it was a cool little film :)",1362268800,,155,3.875
7968204,5,B00006G8JQ,"I loved this movie. It was definitely a little dark, but Jeremy Renner was amazingly hilarious. I laughed several times throughout this movie and I loved listening to the commentary. Very informative on how an independant movie is made.",1359331200,,236,5.076923076923077
7968205,4,B00006G8JQ,"Fish in a Barrel reminds me of Trainspotting, with its delight in violence and devil may care attitude, but it's lighter with more humor and less introspection.

Every character was engaging in some way. The story was straightforward, pulled no punches, and kept me interested the whole way through.",1355184000,,299,5.1020408163265305
7968206,5,B00006G8JQ,i loved this funny and quirky movie jeremy  renner was absolutely funny.  i would highly recommend this movie to any rennerholic,1350345600,,128,5.0476190476190474
7968207,1,B00006G8JQ,This is perhaps one of the most mind blowingly wretched pieces of celluloid to ever steal away precious moments of my life.,1347926400,2,123,4.636363636363637
7968208,1,B00006G8JQ,it was just kinda dumb. stopped watching it after jeremy renners character died. it wasn't hilarious. i think it took the worst of the gangster pics of late 1990s- early 2000s and crammed it into one low budget flick. its like a crap book you buy at the airport- it wastes some time without leaving too much to think about behind,1346198400,2,329,4.409836065573771
