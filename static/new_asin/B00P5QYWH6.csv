6787620,5,B00P5QYWH6,"Growing up in the late 70s, early 80s, In Search Of with Leonard Nimoy was one of my favorite television shows. Back before Google and Wikipedia, programs like this were one of the few ways a country kid like me who had spent his whole life on a ranch could find out about the world and learn about some of its mysteries. It was a time before the smug cynicism and skepticism of today's world, so people were far more open-minded about the subject matter covered on In Search Of: Ghosts, UFOs, Cryptids, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and old world legends. Each week strange phenomena, unexplained disappearances, unusual weather phenomenon, hauntings or other interesting subjects were discussed with input from experts in those fields. This complete series set packages all six seasons in an attractive and affordable 2-case box you'll be happy to display in your home. The only complaint I have is that the discs are stacked on a spool, one atop the other. I really dislike that storage method as its easy to scratch and scuff the discs if one isn't careful. But don't let that stop you from purchasing this product. The pros far outweigh that one con.",1499990400,9,1157,4.7611940298507465

Its also interesting how some of these 'mysteries' have been scientifically explained over the last 40 years.  Its a sentimental favorite of mine as my father and I watched it in the 80s/90s on The History Channel but due to the shows age it may not be for everyone.",1499299200,2,399,4.513888888888889

6787624,4,B00P5QYWH6,The fancier box set sold for between $40-$50. In retrospect I probably should have just got that. But for $20 the whole series...had a hard time passing that up. There is no episode break down on any kind or this would've been one of the best buys of my dvd collection.,1498176000,,269,4.294117647058823
6787625,3,B00P5QYWH6,"I kind of wish I hadn't purchased this. Good for some nostalgia, but I forgot that they never give you much of a payoff on this show, just the ""what if"".

6787631,5,B00P5QYWH6,"Today, in the age of Internet TV, the home viewer has illimitable options for consuming content on multiple screens anywhere at anytime. We have more documentaries than we have hours in a lifetime, which was a cornerstone and successful strategy of Netflix.

In Search of  was produced at a time when television programs like Nova, The Ascent of Man, Wild Kingdom, Jacques Coustea were being consumed by households and there was a search to learn more and seek out deeper meaning in life. Leonard Nimoy, like Rod Serling, was the right host and enigmatic voice to keep us spellbound for the show's duration.  The show ran from 1977 to 1982 and produced 144  episodes running 6 Seasons. It was a success. Moreover, fans of In Search of were dedicated to the weekly half hour segments that tackled controversial and contentious subject matter, hence the show's disclaimer:

""This series presents information based in part on theory and conjecture. The producer's purpose is to suggest some possible explanations, but not necessarily the only ones, to the mysteries we will examine.""

And the conclusion of each episode:

Lost civilizations. Extraterrestrials. Myths and monsters. Missing Persons. Magic. Witchcraft. Unexplained Phenomena. In Search of cameras are traveling the world, seeking out these great mysteries. This program was the result of the work of scientists, researchers and a group of highly skilled technicians.

QUALITY,  PACKAGING & PRESENTATION

VEI released a more expensive and better package of the series back in 2012 that was double the price. This 2016 release is austere and does not offer any unique liner notes, episode index or any other fancy add-ons. It is a great series in a plain brown wrapper so to speak. The DVDs are stacked like pancakes in the two clam-shells. 6 discs/12 total (12 episodes per DVD).

The quality and transfer is fine and if the production quality looks inferior or odd to you it is not due to VEI. Overall I think the series for the cost is an excellent and inexpensive alternative to pricey box sets.

Please note: This set does not include Mitch Pileggi revival/reboot produced in 2002.

LOOKING BACK, WE'RE STILL IN SEARCH OF...

It has been 35 years since the original In Search of show's conclusion. Leonard Nimoy passed away in 2015.  Chupacabras, extraterrestrial life, paranormal activity, ghosts and mysteries, myths and conspiracies abound to this day - some debunked since the show. We still haven't found Hoffa or Bigfoot for that matter, or still don't have all the answers to the death of Marilyn Monroe or Glenn Miller.

What does matter is this show belongs to a special moment in television history when our concentration and questions were focused on something greater than us and the investigative quality of programming narrated by a one-of-a-kind host beat out today's reality TV and pointless social media distractions and spurious internet stories.

I will always be ""In Search of"" something and I hope you are too.

6787633,3,B00P5QYWH6,"We are big scifi buffs, and enjoy listening to Coast to Coast in the evenings on the radio in our ""off the grid"" home in rural Alaska, so this boxed set was right up our alley, even though so much of info is outdated, but still great fun! I wish the set could be digitally remastered because it's a grainy production, which almost fits it's 70's era theme. Nimoy is marvelous, the perfect narrator for this series...",1491436800,8,416,4.415584415584416
6787634,5,B00P5QYWH6,"Brings back a lot of memory's. Also interesting to see the change what we thought in the 70's and what we think now. From ""Going back to another ICE AGE"" To ""GLOBAL WARMING"" and how the Titanic sank.",1490140800,,199,4.2631578947368425
6787635,5,B00P5QYWH6,Goes on for hours and is really interesting.  Glad I purchased this.,1489881600,2,68,4.666666666666667
6787636,5,B00P5QYWH6,"Like Unsolved Mysteries, this too was nightmare fuel for those young enough to have watched. If you're here then you already know about the show so I'll move onto this set: This is the same set as the previous one except it doesn't have the Rod Serling specials that jump started the show nor does it have the reboot episodes (8 episodes from the early 2000s). If this is fine with you, then go ahead and grab. At half the price of the previous set, it was a no-brainer for me. Whatever isn't on here is on YouTube anyway so it's not like they're completely inaccessable. Don't expect dazzling picture quality from this either, as most of the episodes are straight from their videotape masters (to me it adds a certain nostalgic charm). Also, just noting: this set comes with no sort of episode guide or disc breakdown. With certain shows like this, it can be a problem to find that certain episode you want. All discs are stacked on a hub which may be a drawback for some",1489017600,28,972,4.435754189944134

6787638,5,B00P5QYWH6,"Excellent, top notch. A definite 'must have' for anyone looking for something different to think about.  The entire series focuses on the need for scientific study as well as trying to go beyond what science can handle and identify.  An excellent collection of historic pieces with many different viewpoints presented. A simple must have for anyone looking to go beyond being 'a box of rocks'.",1481760000,2,393,5.030769230769231

The shows would hang up and pixelate, but they did play perfectly on the drive in my laptop as well as a Blu-ray player.  There is some type of tracking problem with the discs. If you run into problems, try a different player. You do not want to miss these shows. Leonard Nimoy is still the best host out of three who have done this series.",1532563200,,500,4.154639175257732

8686445,1,B00P5QYWH6,"I have been waiting for years for this series. I was excited to get this as a gift (bought on Amazon). I am very disappointed with the quality of the recordings. This may as well be a bad bootleg. There have been so many glitches with the DVD that I bought. The recordings stop at times, pause constantly, and the audio recording is problematic. I'm on the first disk and hope the others are better quality. There was a disclaimer that the original tapings were flawed and that there are technical problems do to this. I cannot believe something this is being sold.",1527292800,,565,4.495145631067961

Now unlike many show's that followed on the History Channel and even PBS ( Ken Burns ).
This show tells you up front the shows conclusions are based in part on theory and conjecture.
If you like me saw this in your teens it is a great way to visit that time again and ask questions about these and other subjects.
If you have never seen them. I think you see upon viewing all the other programming and cable channels it gave birth to.",1525219200,,574,4.18018018018018
8686447,5,B00P5QYWH6,Wonderful series!  I got this primarily for my autistic 16-year-old son but I have to admit I love the series as well.  Much of the information is still very relevant and we both enjoy watching these episodes together.  This series also has a somewhat dated and nostalgic appeal given the time in which it was filmed and that also has in and of itself some real learning value for my son who struggles to see many things beyond a concrete thinking pattern.  Overall we really love this series and the price to value ratio is incredible.  And let's be honest here - Leonard Nimoy was always really fantastic and interesting which took a good series over the top in terms of how great it is. The packaging was as basic as it gets with multiple disks in one case - but for the price (under $20 for the whole series) I am not about to complain about that.,1525219200,,851,4.360759493670886
