4898955,5,B005WAP2U6,"This movie had to be one of the best dark comedies I have seen in a few years.  Gleeson is the perfect character.  I felt like Cheadle's character, when he asked him (paraphrazed) if he was a genius or an idiot.  The movie hits on many levels and is an independent film gem!  Highly recommended.  Lots of F-bombs (for those that might get offended by them), but hey, its a black comedy",1325721600,,385,4.291666666666667
4898956,5,B005WAP2U6,"What an awesome movie!  When my friends dragged me to the movie I didn't want to go because I don't like comedies.  It w funny without even trying and very irreverent. No subject was off limits.  The jokes, in another context, would give great offense, but here it was all in good fun.  The drug dealers, while terrible characters, came off as loveable (sort of) in the end.  Great movie, just be prepared some strong language.  2 thumbs up!",1320451200,3,441,4.518987341772152

4898960,5,B005WAP2U6,"Oh yeah. I like it. Only the Irish could do this kind of ""High noon and Shane"" mash up with the correct amount of ""humor with a sly smile"".",1430870400,,139,3.8275862068965516
4898961,2,B005WAP2U6,"Has some good moments, but all togheter just OK, Gleeson and Cheadle  is however well packed with funny lines.",1430611200,,110,4.7894736842105265
4898962,5,B005WAP2U6,Brendan Gleeson is at his best. The dialog is filled with humor. Don Cheadle plays an FBI agent on the defense from the guard,1429747200,,125,4.25

4898966,5,B005WAP2U6,A fantastic new way of Irish movie making.  Modern yet very Irish indeed - love the humour.  Brendan Gleeson is a national treasure.,1396396800,,132,4.695652173913044
4898967,5,B005WAP2U6,"I won't bother with a synopsis, there are plenty here already, but I will add that this film had me laughing throughout with its dark, incisive humour and the accuracy with which it depicts the Irish embrace of the oddities of their culture. The only criticism I have is that the climactic action scene at the end has what feels like a huge continuity error that dropped with a thud. Putting that aside, this is a very, very funny film, and a near-perfect role for Brendan Gleeson.",1395532800,,481,4.540229885057471
4898968,5,B005WAP2U6,"Originally saw this film in the theatre. Loved it. Just as funny the second time on DVD. Brendan Gleeson's deadpan contrasts with Don Cheadle's energy beautifully. The philosophizing drug smugglers are a riot. If you like British humor, you'll love Irish.",1388016000,,255,5.2439024390243905
4898969,5,B005WAP2U6,I really enjoyed this movie. It might be a little slow for some-but I enjoyed the way each piece came together and the really wonderful acting. Brenden Glesson builds a great character in this Irish cop drama/mini-thriller. A nice sense of humor runs through it as well...,1386028800,,272,4.808510638297872
4898970,5,B005WAP2U6,One of the funniest movies I have seen in a while.  Love the dry humor and the not taking it seriously of an old school cop in a fish out of water type role dealing with all of the politics verses being left alone.,1384732800,,214,3.8636363636363638
4898971,5,B005WAP2U6,"Loved this movie - it featured brilliant acting, directing & producing for sure.  Don Cheedle is wonderful, but surrounding actors were tremendous as well.",1379203200,,155,5.458333333333333
4898972,5,B005WAP2U6,I saw the movie in athe local theatre and loved it.  I bought the DVD to share with those who otherwise never would see it.  Plus I enjoy rewatching it!,1373846400,,152,4.033333333333333
4898973,5,B005WAP2U6,"If you like dry british humor, this is the movie for you. Brendan Gleeson is hilarious as the grumpy cop.  The supporting cast is equally entertaining.  This is one of those great movies you never heard of.",1370736000,,206,4.54054054054054
4898974,5,B005WAP2U6,This is a very funny movie. I was so glad to see it come to Blu-ray. It will make you laugh,1370390400,,91,3.380952380952381
4898975,5,B005WAP2U6,"Dark, hilarious with a fantastic plot and even better directing and editing. Great comedy like this is hard to find, and Gleeson performance is completely unforgettable. Don Cheadle also does a great job as being the sort of ""voice of reason"" in the world of law enforcement, and the dialogue between the two of these actors is worth the price of admission alone. I highly recommend this film for anyone who has a darker sense of humor. If you enjoyed In Bruges or Seven Psychopaths, then you will likely enjoy this film.",1361404800,,521,4.673913043478261
4898976,5,B005WAP2U6,"Weaknesses of human nature create scenes that are simultaneously funny and sad. Loved our hero, and his unexpected nobility of nature.  I don't easily tire of this movie and love the humor.",1361318400,,189,4.90625
4898977,4,B005WAP2U6,"Very good movie, slow at times, but the punchlines is where they keep you watching.  Would only recommend this movie if you are a fan of dark comedy.",1358812800,,149,4.321428571428571
4898978,5,B005WAP2U6,"Being a retired police officer I really enjoyed this movie which I rate as the best cop flick of the year. Gleeson is superb as an old timer who does things his way. The barbs he trades with Cheadles character are priceless and had me LMAO. Watching this movie with some retired LE friends, they all loved it and highly recommend it to others. This is one of those sleeper foreign films that should have had wider release here in the US. A dark comedy showing that police work is the same no matter what country you're in. Great movie, I bought several as Christmas gifts for friends it was so good.",1353974400,11,599,4.357142857142857
4898979,2,B005WAP2U6,"Maybe because my vision is a little hazy or I don't see perfect 20/20 yet really could not tell what I was watching.  The title made no sense, I never laughed, could not understand what was going on, and got lost since the title description did not really happen in the film.  If you pass on this movie, don't feel bad since you probably saved yourself 90 minutes you would want back.

4898980,4,B005WAP2U6,"I often have to turn on the sub-titles with many of these Irish crime films, but managed to get through ""The Guard"" without them.  Perhaps it helped that Don Cheadle is along for the ride as a FBI agent with a hint of a southern accent (although he professes to be from Wisconsin in the film).  Brendan Gleeson (""Safe House,"" ""Harry Potter"" films) plays a policeman (known as The Guard) in a small west coast Irish town.  Agent Everett (Cheadle)  is tracking down a crew of drug smugglers which led him to Ireland.  He's forced to work with Sgt. Boyle (Gleeson) who is happy with the way things are and has little interest in interrupting his day off to assist the American.

The dark comedy has chuckles in every scene thanks to Gleeson's ""really smart or really dumb"" cop.  He's aided by the drug runners themselves played with deadpan panache by Mark Strong (""John Carter""), Liam Cunningham (""Safe House"") and David Wilmot.  The film has some interesting twists and turns becoming at times a crime procedural, but eventually it becomes an unlikely ""buddy"" film of the first order.  In his directorial debut, John Michael McDonagh (who also wrote) makes an impressive entry with this import.

The Blu ray disc is nothing special but certainly looks as good as any other typical product out there.  Look for a 1080p transfer with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  There are many dark scenes both inside and outside but they are perfectly clear.  The audio is in DTS-HD MA uncompressed.  Everything is clear and mostly upfront.  The surrounds come into play with a shootout involving a Russian automatic rifle in addition to handguns.",1334361600,,1624,4.7913669064748206
4898981,5,B005WAP2U6,I have watched this movie three times and i still find it to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time!  Love it!,1330128000,,124,3.4285714285714284
4898982,5,B005WAP2U6,I was entertained and admired how clever and subtle this movie was.  While not a great action adventure it was brain candy which made me smile and showed me 'another' way of looking at things that I had never considered.  I recomended it to all my friends and do so to you also. If you are like me you will finish with a smile of satisfacation and contentment that only comes from a good meal or good movie.,1329350400,,407,4.205128205128205

4898985,4,B005WAP2U6,"This movie had some pretty funny moments. One thing that I had trouble with was understanding just exactly what they were saying.

Brendan Gleeson is so dry and so uniquely true, and the character development is well done throughout for the time available.
