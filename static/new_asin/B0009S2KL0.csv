8065982,3,B0009S2KL0,"About The Release:

This is a review of the Exploitation Digital/KittyMedia (NTSC Reg. 1) DVD titled Divine Emanuelle Love Cult. Packaging indicates aspect ratio 1.85:1, when true ratio is 1.33:1. Packaging indicates running time at 88 Minutes, when true running time is 98 minutes. Picture and sound quality are relatively high, so this is definitely not just some transfer from VHS. Special Features include ""deleted scenes"", ""promotional trailer"", ""Exploitation Digital Trailers"" and a photo gallery. - The trailers look to be new productions rather than original theatrical trailers, but the photo gallery had what looked to be real promotional materials for the movie on its original release (around 1981).

About The Movie:

Laura Gemser plays the leader and apparent deity of a sex cult who tries taking in the daughter of an American Politician.

I've had an old VHS tape of this movie under the title ""Love Camp"" for many years, I decided to update to DVD on a whim.
A quick look around the internet didn't give a whole lot of information on the movie. For instance, I assume the original aspect ratio of this movie wasn't 1.33:1 (or 4:3), though IMDB lists it this way.
The movie was directed by an Austrian singer named Christian Anders, who also stars in the movie and IMDB also lists it as a West German production.
Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti of the Black Emanuelle movies also star and Gemser is prominently featured, though the name Emanuelle is clearly slapped on the movie for sales reasons. It's pretty basic exploitation fare, but mostly a softcore sex movie and obviously it was filmed to be. There are a few ridiculously awful musical bits in the movie that provide a bit of entertainment and there a few other laughable moments, but also a few nasty shocks to be found here. The production values are relatively low, having natural outdoor scenes, some even pretty ones despite far from inspired cinematography, but the indoor scenes are bland to the point of being hard to watch; shot on nearly empty studio sets. These are really bottom of the barrel scenes that seemed like they just wanted to shoot the cast in various tepid softcore scenes and they'd dub in dialogue and write story around them. That said, the story does exist and has an acceptable amount of detail, I just think the inconsistent quality of the movie gets in the way here.
So in closing, the movie is not aesthetically pleasing, nor is it laughable enough to keep me interested, though it's not without a few fine points. Laura Gemser is probably the one marketable selling point of the movie, and so it's worth having in my collection.",1424044800,,2636,4.8381374722838135
8065983,3,B0009S2KL0,"Laura Gemser is the head of a love cult that believes in free love but not forming any permanent attachments to any one person. Her main disciple and recruiter is a true believer, until he finds that special someone and tells Gemser that he must leave the cult to be with the woman he loves. Getting out though is not easy and the cult is also being investigated by the authorities. Gemser believes in what she does but is a psycho who is willing to do anything to protect her cult, incuding mass murder. This was made in the early seventies but you can see similarities with Jonestown. Mixing erotica with something this dark is not entertaining, but it is probably a must for fans of Laura Gemser.",1370476800,,699,4.46875
