2764814,5,B000NDDU1A,"Every now and then I check to see if Marriage Go Round is finally out in DVD.  It's a fun movie starring James Mason, Susan Hayward, and Julie Newmar.  And while I love the film itself, what really stands out to me are the costumes and set decorating.  Charles Le Maire does a fabulous job with the costuming, dressing the characters in crisp, cool, late 1950s, early 1960s hip clothing.  Mason and Hayward wear more traditional attire while Newmar is stunning in her sexy, chic, fun-looking pedal pushers and barely there tops.  We can expect such from him, having dressed the incomparable Marilyn Monroe in ""The Seven Year Itch,"" and Joanne Woodward in ""The Long, Hot Summer.""  Duncan Cramer, however, is the one who really blows it out of the water with his art direction in Marriage Go Round.  The sets are modern, with beautiful clean lines, uncluttered and completely understated.

I only hope this film will at last be released on DVD soon, so we may be able to enjoy it, again and again.",1289952000,,995,4.645714285714286
2764815,5,B000NDDU1A,"I can't agree more with the other two reviews.  An Excellent, fun movie starring 3 great actors.  Susan Hayward, James Mason, and Julie Newmar are a fantastic mix.  I waited forever for Susan Hayward's ""Soldier of Fortune"" with Clark Gable to be released on DVD and bought it the instant I knew it was out.  This great movie is on the top of my wish list.",1249171200,5,355,4.333333333333333
2764816,5,B000NDDU1A,"THE MARRIAGE-GO-ROUND IS ONE OF THE FEW COMEDIES THAT SUSAN HAYWARD APPEARED IN.  ALTHOUGH, KNOWN MOSTLY FOR DRAMA SHE OFFERS A VERY APPEALING, PLEASING PERFORMANCE ALONGSIDE JAMES MASON AND JULIE NEWMAR.  THE FILM IS FUN AND ENTERTAINING AND TAKES US BACK TO THE HOLLYWOOD OF THE EARLY 1960S.  IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE FOR A GREAT DVD THAT IS FUNNY AND APPEALING--SOMETHING VERY LACKING IN THE COMEDY OF TODAY.  PLEASE 20TH CENTURY FOX DO THE RIGHT THING AND RELEASE ""THE MARRIAGE-GO-ROUND"" ON DVD......IT WILL MEAN ANOTHER SUSAN HAYWARD FILM WILL ENTERTAIN THE WORLD........THANK YOU...........GARY JASINKONIS....EAST NORTHPORT, NEW YORK........THE ULTIMATE SUSAN HAYWARD FAN..........",1217635200,11,686,5.762376237623762
2764817,5,B000NDDU1A,"This is an interesting film in Susan Hayward's filmography since it is one of the few comedies she was in.
Made two years after her oscar winning role,""I want to live"", Hayward is vey spiritual in this diverting 1960 movie,co starring the talented James Mason and Julie Newmar.

It is also in technicolor and gives again the possibility to watch ""The redhead from Brooklyn"" in color, which is always a feast for the eyes.

I for one  am eagerly waiting  for the anounced release of this DVD.Let's hope 20 century Fox hurry up with its release.",1187913600,10,543,4.625
2764818,5,B000NDDU1A,"I saw it years ago when it first came out.  I find the older I get, I cannot fault very many movies James Mason made.  I enjoyed the movie way back then and enjoyed it more now.  I know the movie did not get good reviews when it came out, but I seldom criticize performances unless they are really, really bad.  I like to just sit back, relax and enjoy.",1366156800,,353,4.0
2764819,5,B000NDDU1A,"I have been a fan of James Mason nearly all of my life, since I saw him when I was a child in ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"". I thought then, ""What a handsome, charming man!"" and I've never lost that feeling.
Mr. Mason usually plays serious roles, but he made a few light comedies in his career and he did a wonderful job in all of them. This film is from the early 60's so its premise is a bit dated, but the actors are fun to watch. James Mason is at his handsome best and in this movie. He is being hit on by a beautiful young Swedish houseguest who wants him to father her child while he remains determined to stay loyal to his loving wife.
Julie Newmar and Susan Hayward are wonderful in their roles as would-be seductress and loving wife respectively, but it is the delightful comedic performance of James Mason that makes the movie for me. If you enjoy light comedy or if you are a fan of James Mason, this movie is a must for your collection. This film is in the same vein as ""A Touch of Larceny"" and ""Tiara Tahiti"", two other delightful romantic comedies staring JM, and you'll love it!",1365811200,,1101,4.19811320754717
2764820,3,B000NDDU1A,"---From the moment (approximately 5 minutes into the film) when Julie Newmar (as Katrina Swen) gracefully slinks into the gorgeous Frank Loyd Wright-built home of professors Content and Paul Lowell, she (literally) sashays away with the film.....ANYONE (male or female) who can direct more than a fleeting glance at the two supposed leads in the film (Mason and Hayward) when Newmar is sharing film space, is a special individual, indeed. Aside from Newmar's most obvious beauty, she has a feline grace and elegance that defies description, and the Swedish accent she affects, and idiosyncracies she brings to the character of Katrina show why she won the Tony award in 1959 for her portrayal of the same character in the stage version (opposite such heavy weights as Claudette Colbert and Charles Boyer, no less). I have always believed that her exceptional height (6'0""), kept her from acheiving the super-stardom her talents so richly deserved (as, in the 1950's and '60's, there were far fewer really tall leading men than there are today--Tom ""shorty"" Cruise aside--). Despite this dearth of equally tall (and gorgeous) male actors, her exceptional beauty was recognized at the time (with even crochety NY Times critic Bosley Crowther stating that in this film, she looks like some 21st Century ""vision"" with perfect proportions).....I was not yet born when this film was made, but have always liked it.....the low rating is due to the fact that the film version falls far short of the stage version (cuts made to the dialogue, due to the industry's adherence to a ""G/PG"" rating system --before it was introduced-- killed much of the interesting banter). In addition, the casting of Mason and Hayward (in lieu of say, Cary Grant and Claudette Colbert), greatly affected the film's comic value, and the script cuts reduced the film to a somewhat one-dimensional ""inside joke"".....That being said, it is still VERY MUCH worth watching, if only to see the Tony Award performance of Newmar and the gorgeous sets................",1365206400,4,2028,5.1299093655589125
2764821,3,B000NDDU1A,"A happily married Academic couple, she (Susan Hayward) is the Dean Of Women and he (James Mason) is a professor, are entertaining a house guest from Sweden. But when the statuesque house guest (Julie Newmar, recreating her Tony award winning stage performance) makes a proposal that he father her baby, what begins as suggestion not taken seriously leads to a marital meltdown. What was daring and risque in the 1958 Broadway play by Leslie Stevens (THE WAR LORD) and its film version barely raises an eyebrow today. Which removes much of the play's teeth and leaves us with a gummy sex farce. Who thought it was a good idea to cast Hayward and Mason in a sex comedy anyway? Neither are exactly known for their farcical abilities. Fortunately, Newmar is a delight as the Swedish amazon who wants a genius to father her child and compensates for the two leads. However, Hayward does acquit herself nicely in a confrontational scene with Newmar over her husband, if only the rest of the film were on that level. Directed by Walter Lang (THE KING AND I). With Robert Paige and June Clayworth.

The Fox MOD DVD-r is a nicely rendered anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer.",1365120000,2,1169,4.758620689655173
2764822,4,B000NDDU1A,"It's a really nice widescreen anamorphic picture.  The colors are good and the image is sharp. My only concern was the sound had a little hiss which I noticed in the last third of the film and I don't think it is in stereo.  Why can't Fox master ""Tender is the Night"" as well as this one!",1364256000,3,288,4.035087719298246
2764823,5,B000NDDU1A,"a wonderful comedy starring Susan Hayward,JAMES mASON and Julie newamar which shows these actors dealing with a serious issue in a comical way",1363305600,,142,5.217391304347826
2764824,5,B000NDDU1A,"This witty film features Susan Hayward and James Mason doing great comedic work in the roles originated by Claudette Colbert and Charles Boyer on Broadway. Julie Newmar repeats her Tony Award-winning Broadway role on the big screen. The play ran for about a year and a half on the Great White Way.( Personal favourite moment:  Susan Hayward lighting a match on a particular part of a statue's anatomy and expressing her frustration with her husband in the process!).
  The good news is that this is a very good 16:9 (ie. anamorphic) transfer of this 2.35:1 CinemaScope movie. Well worth getting for fans of Mason, Hayward, Newmar and (slightly) risque comedies from the early '60's. Thanks Fox for doing this one right!",1360972800,,719,4.925619834710743
2764825,5,B000NDDU1A,"After seeing this movie on TV a while back, I can safely say that I love Susan Hayward more than I love myself.  That is saying a lot because I am a narcissus, not only that but a card carrying narcissus which is the worst kind.",1355356800,,228,3.9565217391304346
2764826,5,B000NDDU1A,what a wonderful story and a great movie plus three totally over the top great actors. But here is the catch - I can't afford $80+ for one dvd. In today's world that will purchase a few days groceries. What is the problem. If you would make it affordable you might sell more copies. Wow - I should have paid more attention to economics in high school.,1342915200,,351,4.253731343283582
2764827,5,B000NDDU1A,"This is a great film. It would be great and entertaining, if this was released on dvd. Please someone put this on dvd real soon. It would be great for everyones collection. This is a very clean comedy set in the 60's . Which is very rare today. It would be another great Susan Hayword movie, so please release it on dvd real soon. You will not be sorry you did !! Plus you will make lot's of money if you do !!! Thnks for reading !!!!",1325376000,,434,4.0

8176770,5,B000NDDU1A,"Very engaging, warm, but comedic but yet looks at the forces that can affect a marriage. Though you laugh, the emotions that bind a marriage are also demonstrated.",1407801600,,163,4.857142857142857
8176771,3,B000NDDU1A,"It's classic B movie fair, from the sixties.  Wasn't much else made during that time and, it's letter box format seems to have annoying digital lines at the top of the film that can be very distracting.  Other than that, it's exactly what I'd expected it to be, good old fashioned tacky fun.",1401235200,,291,4.471698113207547
8176772,5,B000NDDU1A,"This movie was a childhood memory and has been on my ""look for"" list for decades. Another late 50s - early 60s battle of the sexes, I put this title up there with ""Pillow Talk"", ""How to Murder Your WIfe"", and ""Move Over Darling"". Julie Newmar apparently reprised her Broadway role for the film, and I can see why it might have been difficult casting it with anyone else! While it's really a one gag film, it nevertheless is an interesting look back.",1386633600,,449,4.421686746987952
8176773,5,B000NDDU1A,Julie Newmar is fantastic in this movie. For a movie made in 1964 this feature holds up well in 2013.,1379030400,,101,4.1
