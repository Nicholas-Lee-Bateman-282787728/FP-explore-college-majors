7491023,5,B0177ZTCWM,This is a great Mother - daughter movie.  Full of laughing and crying.  Great feel good movie with a positive message. I took my 12 year old daughter and we BOTH loved it! - Annette,1447372800,7,181,4.142857142857143
7491024,5,B0177ZTCWM,"Once I Was A Beehive is an amazing movie. It will make you laugh, cry, smile, ... And make you laugh again. The actors did a great job getting their parts perfected and clearly the cast AND crew put a lot of hard work into the movie. I was able to meet the man who plays the bishop in the movie and he is great! This movie is a must-watch and you won't regret it.

They believe the bible is corrupted, and it's more likely they'd share BOOK OF MORMON stories at camp. There is dark side to this cult. Trust me, do a little research.

7491038,4,B0177ZTCWM,"Well, if you are LDS and enjoy LDS films, you'll probably enjoy this.  If you are not LDS, but may have spent time in Utah, you will probably also enjoy it.  If you don't fit either category, save your money and watch it on Netflix. It was better than the same tired formula as Church Ball, Singles Ward, etc, in that at least some of the characters seem real and NOT a charicature, but some of them still are.  Apparently, it's not possible to make LDS films without that though. All things considered, it was a highly watchable movie--one worth seeing with the kids, or on a date, or just to feel good when you're done with the next Die Hard or Transformers movie.",1483747200,,666,4.354838709677419

7491051,3,B0177ZTCWM,"Every single character apart from Phoebe was poorly developed, and the writing was very sub-par.

7491070,4,B0177ZTCWM,"I was a little worried this movie would be too preachy, as I am not a Christian and have had enough people try to convert me to last a lifetime. However, the reviews and the female-centric, upbeat nature of the film made it seem like it was worth a shot for a change of pace. This was a sweet, genuine movie that handled loss of a parent to cancer authentically and is one of the rare films that focuses on female relationships with zero love triangles or romantic drama. The girl who plays Phoebe is adorable and the main actress is very likable. This UU Pagan gives Once I Was a Beehive a solid thumbs up.",1467676800,,607,4.241379310344827

7491077,5,B0177ZTCWM,"Poignant and funny, my husband and I enjoyed this film about a16-year old whose father dies and whose mother later remarries into an Latter-day Saint family. Her new sweet 12-year-old cousin is a member of the Church's Young Women's organization and needs a friend. She is afraid of so many things which includes girl's summer camp. Sacrificing her anger and grief, the
16-year old Encourages her cousin by going with her to the church camp, and the adventure for everyone begins. It is not entirely an accurate representation of LDS girl's camp, but it is
close enough. Verdict: very fun-- don't miss it!!",1465516800,3,606,4.893203883495145

7491089,4,B0177ZTCWM,"A fun, wholesome camp movie for the whole family - but especially young girls.
Yeah, there were some stereotypes, contrived situations and silliness, but there was also a lot of humor and heart... and some decent acting by the dramatic members of the cast. A very good mix of silliness and sadness. The production values are surprisingly high for such a low budget movie.

I'd give it 4 stars for everyone, and most 8-12 year old girls would probably give it 5..

Lane suddenly finds herself part of an LDS (Mormon) family where she agrees to accompany her new anxiety-ridden cousin to church camp. Except for some LDS-culture terms (such as 'Beehive') there is nothing particularly Mormon about this movie and it could have been about any church's Bible camp. It's a wholesome, family-value camp movie, not a religious movie. So, while I personally am a fan of Mormons, I know some people have collected some weird ideas about them, but I think it would be a tragedy if you did not let your children watch this movie based on some misguided concern. This film is delightful and for everybody. My wife and I are empty nesters and we have watched it twice and will certainly watch it again.

I don't know if Amazon will let me say this, but it's also currently available on Netflix - but I think you're kids are going to want to own it!",1462924800,15,1335,4.577405857740586

7491093,5,B0177ZTCWM,"Great movie!  I attended Girls Camp as a teenager for several years and have fond memories. Girls seem a lot ""meaner"" to one another and talk really snarky to each other nowadays. I don't remember that as a youth. We were always taught to be kind to one another, and for the most part we were.
This movie finally got there and I was happy for that.",1461974400,,348,4.1940298507462686

7491096,5,B0177ZTCWM,"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Good Christian based theme of exploring faith while enduring difficulties.  Well acted, good plot, humorous scenes.  Not too preachy, just some teenage girls having a (mostly) great time at camp, building their faith while the camp leaders go over the top in a loving way.  Watched it with my whole family (including 12 year old daughter) and we all loved it.  And there's a bear!",1461628800,,411,4.898550724637682

For those of us raised L.D.S. it is easily to identify with most of the characters as they are us, or those we went to church and church activities with.  However, there is much here that would appeal to those not of the L.D.S. faith.  Much to be learned by this movie for all.  Great fun, great lessons taught, and great entertainment.

7491127,5,B0177ZTCWM,"What an adorable, fun and touching movie! My thirteen-year-old daughter (also currently a Beehive) was sick this weekend and we purchased this movie to watch as a family, but she loved it so much she watched it several times while convalescing. Every family member, from our ten-year-old boy to our 22-year-old daughter, thought this was a great show. And, it made my thirteen-year-old so excited for Girls Camp this summer. Love the writing, the lack of blatant, in-your-face Mormon content, and the sweetness of all the characters. Well-written, wonderful scenery and whimsical touches, this is a motion picture for the entire family - no bored parents! Perfect for Family Home Evening, slumber parties, Young Women activities or even watching while at Girls Camp!",1458086400,,766,5.235772357723577

7491153,5,B0177ZTCWM,"Sure this is basically a Mormon movie about girls camp, but there are many life's lessons that are taught in this touching film.  Acceptance, understanding and love are among the values presented along with some laughs and corny moments.  This isn't exactly the girls camp I go to, but some things are universal.  The girls and women in this film do a good job and there is a healthy mix of tears, laughter and drama.  Oh yeah - it is about teenage girls so there is plenty of ""angst"" and ""girl drama"" going on.  Even my husband said it brought a few tears to his eyes!  I highly recommend this movie to everyone!",1455580800,2,613,4.380530973451328

Two new step-cousins get to know each other by going to a Bible-Themed Girl's Camp for young Mormon girls, aged 12-17, and learn a lot about themselves and each other along the way.  I loved the hilarious situations the girls and their camp-mates got themselves into, and out of, and the lessons they learned along the way about being tolerant, patient, and charitable.  Being LDS myself, it's hard to be objective, but it didn't seem too preachy or in-your-face religious.  It just seemed like a cute, funny movie that wasn't designed to be taken too seriously.  It seems geared more toward young women.  My sons didn't enjoy it as much as I and my daughters did.",1455321600,,687,4.644628099173554

But it is a tween movie- a little cheesy but also well made- I thought the actors did a great job for being somewhat amateur and not well known. My favorite part of the show is the hot park rangers- I die laughing every time. Streaming quality was great.,1454112000,,387,4.105263157894737

7491187,5,B0177ZTCWM,"First off, let it be known that I am not a big movie theater goer.  Don't get me wrong, I am always up for a good movie but I don't follow what movies are out and feel the need to see everything on the big screen.  The reason behind this is that I am tired of having to be dragged through the mud wanting to cover my eyes and ears in an effort to find some sort of entertainment in between.  It goes to a whole new level when my children are with me.  That being said, I have been kicking myself for not seeing ""Once I was a Beehive"" sooner!  I had heard rumblings of this movie and it was one that I wanted to see.  I finally went with my Mom and we both LOVED it!  It is funny and has it's tender moments that get you right in the heart.  It took me right back to when I was a beehive and almost didn't go to camp.  The cast is awesome and I have become a secret stalker trying to find other movies and things I can see them in.  My parents gave me the DVD for Christmas and I think I almost cried!  I was so happy!  My mother knows me well!  I watched it with my husband and two sons.  They loved it, too!  My husband kept asking if that is really what girls camp is like and yes, it is.  My 10 yr old and I love the soundtrack as well and have been singing ""Together"" over and over and even play it in the car.  We finally have the full soundtrack and are branching out.  The funny thing is, we have not heard complaints from the husband or 15 year old!  If you want to see an honest, clean in every way, and uplifting movie that doesn't make you feel like you need to scrub down the house and everything in it, ""Once I Was a Beehive"" is for you!  We Mormon folk know we can be a little quirky and odd to some but a quote from the movie sums it up well, ""When you're with us, you're family and we will try and treat you as such.""",1452297600,5,1833,3.824468085106383

I had high expectations but it was even better than I thought.  Acting in some parts isn't the greatest, but i think the 2 main teenage girls did great.",1450310400,,441,4.188235294117647

7491213,5,B0177ZTCWM,"let me start by saying I'm a guy so girls camp would be out of the question for me. That and well I'm ever so much more than 20, so I'm not a kid by any means. While I am glad I watched it, this movie on first viewing didn't quite live up to what I expected. It is a good movie but well I expected more drama.
This is a coming of age movie about a girl that spends one weekend a month bonding with her family camping. Then her dad dies and mom up and remarries a year later. She is not quite over her dad dieing so it's a big punch in the gut. Top this off with being sent to her new aunt's house (who she doesn't even know) for a month while mom goes on a honeymoon. Then she finds said aunt isn't even going to be there she is going to camp with her daughter who has issues of her own. Well to make long story short they all go to camp together. Now she finds herself with a group of strangers in the back woods an well she seems to be the only one that knows what they are doing.
This movie is one of those quirky movies that grows on you. I honestly felt my first review needed to stay so I left it untouched above. That said each time I watch it I find a little something more to take away. Some people can't watch a movie over and over. I can. I've seen this movie a good 12-14 times. I've shared it with friends and family rewatching it with them. When I first watched it I gave it 4 stars now it's five because not a lot of movies can take that many watchings in a short time and not get old. This one not only didn't get old it got better.
The amazing part is while it is a christian movie and touches on things of faith it's not a mormon movie or any other sect of christian belief I know about. It isn't preachy or judgemental. Just people sharing and trying to help each other lighten the load of life. That is something I can respect.",1448582400,3,1847,3.888888888888889

Girls camp is hard because LDS teenagers are trying to learn to get along like any other teenager! I love how this movie addresses our problems while acknowledging that our mistakrs don't define who we are. At the end of the day, it's most important to be kind and loving and to keep trying.",1517788800,,387,4.388888888888889
