8002396,4,B0000SXJZK,"I love Jackie Chan, he is one of my favorite martial artists.  I had and lost this movie so went looking for another one and an very happy to have found it.  The Art of Action is and interesting DVD on how martial art came about.  Steven Seagal and Jackie Chan made their debut and spoke on the video.  I found The Medallion for almost $15, I kept looking and found I could buy both videos for under $10.  I would recommend both videos for anyone interested in the history of martial arts.",1358467200,,489,4.21505376344086
