5027833,4,B006X0ZN7Q,"LOL, combine film noir and Jerry Lewis buffoonery, and you have It's Only Money.  What elevates this from other Lewis films is the writing and directing by Frank Tashlin (who directed other Lewis features, including The Geisha Boy). True, Lewis is the complete idiot savant here as Lester March, a TV repairman who is very talented with electronic gadgets but, otherwise, always a clumsy one-man wrecking crew otherwise.  It turns out that he is the long-lost son of a deceased millionaire, but doesn't know it.  Unfortunately, bad guys who are trying to get the fortune for themselves try to kill Lester.  Silly stuff (subtle it is not), but it's strangely appealing.

Besides Lewis, the cast also includes 1940s bad guy Zacharcy Scott, and a darling Mae Quesdel, famous for being the voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl in 1930s cartoons.

The picture quality is excellent, with a fair amount amount of grain.  There should not be any complainers about the video.

Audio is also excellent.

Extras...nada, zip, zilch.

I would recommend this as a perfect example of a 1960s Jerry Lewis but you might want to rent it first before purchase to see if it is something you like.",1340841600,,1173,4.82
5027834,5,B006X0ZN7Q,"""It's Only Money"" is Jerry Lewis's first movie after the break-up with Dean Martin. Lewis is at his best as a
happy-go-lucky TV repairman, dreaming of being a private detective.  Great Lewis slapstick all through the
movie and the ending is quite a surprise.  This 1962 classic is a must see and a must own for serious movie
collectors.",1337212800,,336,4.677966101694915
5027835,5,B006X0ZN7Q,Great movie.  Loved it when I was younger and still love it today.  Really brought out many of the talents of Jerry Lewis.,1336435200,,122,4.260869565217392
5027836,1,B006X0ZN7Q,"I spent to much money for a Blu Ray film, thinking it would be in color. I did see the fine print that it's a black & white film. You won't get my money again, that's for sure.",1335225600,,176,3.6578947368421053
5027837,5,B006X0ZN7Q,"Directed by veteran Looney Tunes director Frank Tashlin, and featuring the lady who voiced the classic Betty Boop (Mae Questel), it is no wonder this homage to 1940's detectives is brandished with cartoon like humor.
The bulk of the cast plays it perfectly straight to keep the proper feel of a gum-shoe crime film, while the humor is left to a well controlled Jerry Lewis and the situations he gets into.
Jesse White (the original Maytag Repairman) dons the trench-coat of the private eye on the trail of fortune grabbing killers.  To get into the mansion he enlists the help (?) of TV repairman Jerry.

Watch for the original theatrical posters for Jerry's movies ""The Errand Boy"" and ""The Geisha Boy"" plastered on the wall outside Jerry's TV repair shop! It is odd that this self-promotion appears here as there is no reference to any movie theaters in the area.

AS FAR AS THE BLU-RAY TRANSFER: It looks generally great & sharp. There is some film dust during the opening titles, this may have happened in the original negative when the optical titles were layered over the live action.  There are also some occasional white negative dust specs, but these are brief.

DNR? There is one instance when Jerry is being watched through the sight of a rifle, the vertical cross-hair in the sight tends to disappear and re-appear as the rifle sight moves across the screen. This could be due to over use of the Digital Noise Reduction process that removes scratches from the film.

My only disappointment is the lack of any bonus material, not even a theatrical trailer (I'm sure one exists). At a list price of almost $30 we should get something, or lower the list price.

Here is hoping that the four missing Jerry Lewis-Paramount films see their way to DVD/Blu-ray:
Three Ring Circus (with Dean Martin)
Visit to a Small Planet
The Sad Sack
Don't Give Up the Ship

Jerry was at his best when over at the Paramount Studios!",1334880000,2,1921,4.696428571428571
5027838,5,B006X0ZN7Q,"Jerry Lewis' lone comedy of 1962 has to be one of his best. Again, Lewis plays a hapless schnook named Lester March, a radio-TV repairman who's befriended a detective (much to the private eye's annoyance) who, in turn, is seeking the missing heir to a wealthy TV genius/pioneer who's passed on. Naturally, as the movie plays out, it's really March who's the missing link, set against a backdrop of menace as greedy relatives conspire to bump him off & collect the money.
Director Frank Tashlin was the perfect guy to handle Lewis; here was a former animation director (of Looney Toons fame, no less) directing a ""living cartoon"". Tashlin relished in dreaming up the wildest gags for Lewis to play out, particularly evident in this film.
The supporting cast is great, particularly Mae Questel (of Betty Boop fame) as a clueless bride-to-be; Jesse White as the private eye; and Jack Weston as a bloodthirsty chauffeur bent on killing Lewis (who always manages to live).
And of course, there's some priceless bits: Lewis narrowly escaping a limo run-down, an exploding boat & a wild climax involving remote-controlled lawnmowers.
Sharp eyes will even notice some self-promotion in one scene: On a wall behind Lewis is a movie poster for ""The Errand Boy""!
Definitely one for Lewis fans to add to their collection!",1334448000,9,1309,4.954545454545454
5027839,4,B006X0ZN7Q,I was pleased to see that It's Only Money would be released on DVD. When I found this out I had no hesitation to order it. After watching this years ago I knew that this would be a great purchase. This DVD does not disappoint. It's just as funny as I remember it. The Standard DVD picture is okay though. Having a few flaws in some places but not bad enough to stop anyone from buying it. If you grew up watching Jerry's movies like I did you'll be happy with this DVD purchase. And even if you didn't grow up with him it's still a good funny movie that the whole family can enjoy.,1334188800,2,581,4.060869565217391
5027840,5,B006X0ZN7Q,"It's Only Money has and will always be my favorite Lewis film.  The cast put on some very humorous performances.  Jack Weston is absolutely perfect as Leopold, the butler for the Charles P. Albright house and sinister partner to Gregory DeWitt (played by Zachary Scott), who's the lawyer of and confidant for the former master of the house, Charles P. Albright Sr.

The dizzy plot keeps pulling silliness out of it's hat for the whole length of the movie.  There's no need to even consider Jerry Lewis' role here because it's so continually ridiculous that it fits perfectly!  Jesse White is another perfect pick as the Private Eye pal of Jerry's character, who is trying to solve the case of the missing heir not knowing.....well, watch and see.

It's one of those movies that just makes you laugh.  I've seen this one many a time and it was no small joy when I saw it was going to be finally put out on DVD.  I've been waiting for this for a long time cause they almost never show this movie on TV anymore.

I'll never forget the scene when the butler, Leopold, is talking to Gregory DeWitt and is told there's a need for a little....accident.  Some of the funniest movies ever were the group that Frank Tashlin and Jerry Lewis made in the late 50's and early 60's.  This one is no exception.  Even if you're not a Jerry Lewis fan, if you want to watch some ridiculously funny gags performed about as well as could be done, I can't recommend It's Only Money enough.",1330041600,18,1467,4.473684210526316
5027841,5,B006X0ZN7Q,I don't know why but this is one of my absolute favorites of Jerry Lewis. It is completely hilarious and a little heart warming. You will love the scene where he is chased by electronic lawnmowers or smears the lipstick on the painting. Two thumbs up!,1329350400,4,251,4.478260869565218
5027842,4,B006X0ZN7Q,"For anyone who enjoys the Jerry Lewis films that were directed by Frank Tashlin, this is a lesser known black and white gem. Before Frank Tashlin directed films, he worked for Warner Brothers directing Looney Tunes cartoons. The first time he directed the solo Jerry Lewis was in 1958 in Rock A Bye Baby followed later in 1958 with The Geisha Boy. In 1960 Tashlin directed Lewis in Cinderfella. Two years later in 1962, Tashlin directed Jerry in this lesser known film It's Only Money. The next year in 1963, Tashlin directed Lewis in Who's Minding The Store- my absolutely favorite Jerry Lewis film of all time. The next year in 1964, Tashlin directed Lewis in their 6th and final film together- The Disorderly Orderly. For a Jerry Lewis fan, these are all must have films and four of these Tashlin/Lewis films are finally on dvd after decades of waiting- Rock A Bye Baby and The Geisha Boy are available this month of February 2012. Then at the end of next month March of 2012, this movie It's Only Money and my favorite of all time- Who's Minding The Store will be available on dvd.

It's Only Money stars Jerry Lewis as an electronics TV Repairman Lester March, who dreams of becoming a detective someday. Lester's best friend Pete Flint (played by Jesse White) is a detective that gets Jerry to help him solve a case for a huge $100,000.00 reward in finding a wealthy woman's long lost nephew. Jerry is a 25 year old orphan, who is recognized in the mansion by the family's attorney as the missing nephew Charles Albright Jr.. The only problem is the attorney bumped off Charles Albright Sr. so he can marry the wealthy woman- Charles Sr.'s sister- Cecilia Albright, then bump her off and get the family fortune. Of course Jerry must be bumped off as well, since his real identity is an heir to the fortune. Luckily, the family nurse Wanda (played by Joan O'Brien) also recognizes Jerry's true identity and helps him from the murderous attorney and butler. This film may not be as hilarious as Who's Minding The Store with it's non stop sight gags and humor, but there are moments where your sides will kill you from laughter. There is a scene where Jerry runs into a female fisherman at a pier that will leave you laughing.

Having these 4 Tashlin/Lewis movie gems finally released after so many decades of waiting by us Jerry Lewis fans is wonderful beyond words. Huge Thank You's to Olive Films for releasing these on dvd this 2012! And for all of you Jerry Lewis fans, don't forget to add this lesser known solid 4 1/2 Star gem to your Lewis library in March when you order the solid 5 Star Who's Minding The Store- between these 2 films, you will be in for some major side-splitting laughs!",1328832000,15,2700,4.5764462809917354

Lots of physical humor and sight gags for the kids to love. Not his best but is still the quintessential Jerry Lewis character -- the poignant buffoon/loser who, because of his guileless and open heart, somehow wins out the end.",1412121600,,369,4.606060606060606

There are many scenes that caught me off guard with the humor, Jerry Lewis was great in that goofy type of comedy. Joan O'Brien in this movie is beautiful. I wished women still wore dresses and were feminine like that. Jerry Lewis plays the benign, pure at heart, romantic type. Were woman actually attracted to this type of man? Jerry Lewis movies worked best when he played the pure at heart, romantic, introverted bumbling characters.",1388448000,,508,4.719101123595506

Like many films of the 40's and 50's there were some ""filler"" moments that could have been omitted. BTW, the thing he's sitting on in the promo pic is a robotic lawn mower. That was a nostalgic-futuristic sci-fi touch to this film that added to the fun.",1386979200,,372,4.180555555555555

I loved this film and could watch it several times before placing it on the classics shelf for another year. I'm not a big fan of slap stick but it comes with pretty much anything Jerry does so be it. You can't go wrong with anything Mr. Lewis does. So have fun and enjoy.,1358294400,,380,4.148648648648648
