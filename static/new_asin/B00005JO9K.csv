However, after watching this program in HD, it's going to be slightly painful to watch it on standard DVD. As long as the shows are going to be in widescreen, I'll still buy them. UPDATE: Maybe the wait will be well worth it. With HD DVD now in the marketplace, and Blu-Ray right behind it, perhaps we'll get these episodes in HD quality video, widescreen, etc. In addition, I truly hope that they're able to license the music originally played in the episodes.

Just want to chime in that I have added my name to the ""be notified if and when it comes out""  There are not many shows these days like this, and with such a strong female leading character, and with a great ensemble cast as well.

1559797,5,B00005JO9K,"When I was a kid, one of my favorite shows was The Wonder Years, and I'm excited to say that it was recently released on DVD! What does this have to do with Cold Case? Well, The Wonder Years DVD release was held up due to music/copyright issues. Sound familiar? I'm keeping my fingers crossed that maybe there's hope for Cold Case on DVD. I know the Ion channel airs it one or two days a week but I don't always catch it. Cold Case is, in my opinion, one of the BEST shows ever created. All the characters have depth and strong personalities. The time periods are captured perfectly with music, clothing, culture, and even picture quality. Every episode will draw you in. Not once have I ever begun watching an episode without seeing it to the end. I'm getting awfully impatient. Cold Case on DVD is a must.",1414195200,10,807,4.386666666666667
1559798,5,B00005JO9K,"This is one of the most compelling TV dramas ever made.  And I've clicked on the button to ""notify"" me when it's released.  But to tell you the truth, I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for a legit DVD set of this series.  The reason it's not released on home video might go way beyond the ""music rights"" issues previously mentioned.

Five years before COLD CASE even aired, CTV (Canadian TV network) released a series titled COLD SQUAD. And the producers of COLD SQUAD claim that COLD CASE is ""rip off"" of their series. Litigation is still ongoing on this matter. Meredith Stehm, the creator of COLD CASE, was present at a Canadian Film Centre meeting in 2002 where the concept of COLD SQUAD was discussed. And a year after that, COLD CASE premiered.

CTV's attorneys claim that Stehm used her knowledge of COLD SQUAD to invent a ""copycat"" series. And the lead attorney in CTV's legal team is Pierce O'Donnell ... the attorney who successfully represented Art Buchwald in his copyright infringment suit against Paramount Studios. He's also the attorney who represents the James Bond franchise against any ""copycat"" productions. So, CTV has some serious legal muscle. And the outcome of this litigation is anyone's guess.

FWIW, I was able to find COLD CASE (seasons 1-7) DVDs through another online retailer. Given what I've just said, and based on the shipping info given by the retailer, I'm relatively certain this set is a pirated Chinese knock-off. But until the COLD SQUAD vs. COLD CASE litigation concludes, it's probably the only 7-season copy readily available now. And even when litigation concludes, that doesn't mean a series DVD set will ever be released. So, if I end up with a pirated product, my conscience is clear.",1405036800,22,1738,4.835016835016835
1559799,5,B00005JO9K,"I rarely watch American television these days, however, this is a gripping drama that precisely documents the tone of each episode.

I said are you talking about cold case with the blonde, she said yes. she even mentioned the black detective.
she claims she watches it to. so she told me the next time it comes in she will put it away for me. after that I read on the internet they don't sell cold case in dvd because something stupid with the copywrights of the music. so the big question is............ did she really see cold case on the shelf in walmart seasons 1 and 2. a mystery.....................",1386892800,2,764,4.0
1559903,5,B00005JO9K,"I am a high school English teacher.  I have used numerous Cold Case episodes in the classroom to teach students about parts of history they struggle with, like first hand racism and McCarthyism.  I recorded these shows on a VCR tape when they originally aired, but now they are getting so old it is hard for the kids to watch them.  I started searching to purchase the series of Cold Case and I can't find it anywhere.  As teachers, we are being asked to do more with less and the kids are getting more and more farther away from the things in our past that changed history.  One way to show them this is by letting them watch it themselves in the form of entertaining television.  I just wish I had the opportunity to buy this  television series to show my kids these episodes to better their understanding of these heavy issues.  Release the series!!!!  Help us teach our children!",1381104000,8,883,4.46875

1559905,5,B00005JO9K,"One thing that REALLY distinguishes COLD CASE from all the other police procedurals--or for that matter, any television or movie production I can think of--is its accuracy in telling the whole story EXACTLY as it happened in a particular era.

It annoys the hell out of me when television characters are wearing tie-dyed shirts in the 1950s, or use modern-day phrases like ""foxy lady,"" etc., that were coined in a later decade. This happens all the time & the lack of verisimilitude turns me off completely.

Even though the music is just about perfectly matched to every plot of every episode of this wonderful show, I'd be happy to live with a DVD of every season, even if they left the music off for lack of copyright permission. It wouldn't detract from the show & they could list music titles in subtitles on the screen so you'd know the context. You cannot copyright a title, which is why so many books & movies have the same title, even though they are different in content.

Anyway, I saw this show for sale in the ""sponsored links"" section of the Amazon search page, so I""m going to go look into that, though I suspect you are all right about the fact that she show has never been released.

I had this same problem with LAW & ORDER when Universal wouldn't release the DVDs at all. I mentioned then, & will reiterate here, that some of us will die before the DVDs are released--literally. We'll never get to watch episodes we want unless the studio or copyright holder releases them.

So we end up recording these shows--FOR FREE--to our DVRs & VCRs & we can collect every show of every season, and WE WILL. So don't be so stupid, Universal et. al. Every day you hoard the media we want to buy is a day you give your show away for free. There are also plenty of place on the Internet when you can get bootleg copies of any show you want.

Do you want us to support copyright infringement, the bootlegging industry, or cable re-runs instead of getting the money you want for a DVD set? There's just no word except ""dumb"" to describe this behavior.

Having trouble getting rights? That usually means the artist wants more money than you're willing to pay. Get a staff together of persuasive people who can negotiate. I've never heard of anyone denying permission for usage, as long as he got paid. Didn't Michael Jackson buy the entire Beatle catalog? Doesn't Bill Gates own a huge lot of da Vinci paintings & drawings?

Got money? Want some more? Get busy so I don't have to die waiting to buy a legitimate DVD set of this great show.",1378425600,7,2542,4.4989154013015185
1559906,5,B00005JO9K,"Cold Case was one of the very best mainstream television series EVER produced!!  It had a wonderful, quirky, well put together cast, people you truly cared about, it had mystery, humor, longing, sadness, anger, fear and love, just about every emotion possible to the human psyche was engaged when watching this show.  It also required the viewer to keep the mind engaged, something that is missing in so many of today's programs, drama or otherwise. To not be able to purchase this series is absolutely insane.  If the reason is because of the music, well my goodness, you'd think the artists would be thrilled to have new listeners who would purchase their music.  As far as the 40's music, why wouldn't they want new generations of listeners and an entirely new crop of buyers?  I would be so thrilled to buy the Complete Series of Cold Case and not have to watch whatever I can find in the willy-nilly sequence of repeats.

The storylines were amazing and remarkably well written and beautifully portrayed by the cast members.  Possibly one of the most atmospheric shows ever found on American television, ""Cold Case"" also introduced members of its audience to different time periods of the 20th century and added even more dimension with its use of fabulous era-appropriate music to help in telling their stories.

I agree with what other reviewers have stated and I will not spend my hard earned money on a product that does not stand up to it's original quality.  If it is being held up due issues of the music being released, then think about this prior to taping the episodes and use only the ones willing to release their music.

This was one of the best, if not the best show on TV. The stories were always good, and written so well.
I keep looking for the day when they realize their mistake and bring it back, but I think I'm waiting for nothing.
If they won't bring back the show, then at least give us the shows on DVD. One thing about ""Cold Case,"" not matter how many times you see the
episodes, its always like the first.
Greed in this country by the Music industry is the reason they won't release it. And like one other poster said, if they do, they will change the music.
There use to be a time when if a song was used on a show or movie, the artists and record label were thrilled just for the exposure. Nowadays, it's pay me

Based on other reviews here, it sounds like there is a copyright issue due to all of the music featured in each episode, which is a huge part of why I love ""Cold Case"".

I will also say that I would not be pleased if this show is released without the original soundtrack that was included when the episodes aired on TV.  For me, that would be like removing several key characters from the show.  The music is so important for the emotional connection we feel when watching ""Cold Case"", and it would not be the same show at all if the music was removed or replaced with other songs.

UPDATE: Here it is 2017 and still nothing.  Hugely disappointing, but I'm still hopeful that one day this excellent series will be released on DVD.  I know that there are many fans who feel the same as I do.

I would like to add that it would be nice to see the show offered on Amazon Instant Video as well as on DVD, so that viewers may select favorite episodes without having to purchase all seven seasons on DVD.  I hope that eventually we will have both options available.

While the music enhanced ""Cold Case"", it was the storylines, the plots and the characters that really made the show. If some (or even most copyright holders-----and I cannot believe it is MOST, since the songs were licensed for original broadcast) copyright holders refuse to allow material to be licensed for DVD, so be it. Change those songs. Put in alternate versions; elevator music; whatever. To hold the release of the DVD sets hostage based on the copyright holders (who probably want to charge so much that a single season will cost $199.00), I say let the buggers rot and get the DVDs out.
I have only seen about 20 episodes of ""COLD CASE"", because I rarely watch TV on the TV programmer's schedule. If I see a show that I really like (and all of the episodes I have seen were brilliant), I buy the DVD sets so that I can watch them at my leisure.

He lost his job, His daughter got sick really bad, she died at the age of 4. His brother stop helping him out. The only thing he had to hold on to was the house he lived in as a kid, and a box that his father made for him,and the house got tore down. He was so angry that he had planted a bomb. In the end he tried to kill his own brother's family and he went to jail. The family survived thanks to the detectives being there. The theme song the played on this episode is ""Apologize"". I love Cold Case and I love the way they play music at the end of each case,and one of the detectives see an angel of the person that was killed.",1277596800,2,758,3.74375

But since I am getting started watching it several seasons in, I tried to put the DVD into my Netflix queue. Now I understand why it is not available on Netflix.  The whole music royalties, licensing issues.  It really is a shame because like everyone else, its the music that makes this show so special.  And the music isn't thrown in willy-nilly; for each decade, or era depicted, for each type of individual the episode is based on, pains are taken to make sure the music used is appropriate.  For me to watch an episode based in the 90s (my decade) and have the music exactly as I would have remembered it, is very enjoyable.  And even for decades where I wasn't alive or barely alive I can appreciate the nostalgia brought on by the music used.
So I am with everyone else: bring this to DVD SOON WITH the original music. I know that is too much to ask in this greedy world, but it would very nice to enjoy this well done show in ALL its glory :)",1271548800,8,1065,4.247524752475248

1560190,4,B00005JO9K,"This is not a bonifide review as much as it is an alert to anyone who is a fan of this show and its endearing musical qualities.

After the musical amputations Paramount performed on my beloved Fugitive DVDs, I fear for Cold Case.  Do you hear what I said?  I said I FEAR for Cold Case!

Like The Fugitive series, Cold Case uses music in a way which typifies the scenes and the timepiece of an episode.  If you strip the music in which Cold Case is ensconsed, you have no Cold Case.

The reason why this series is not on the market?  My opinion is because Paramount is not about to set aside money to payoff royalties to the estates of music legends.  Paramount would rather mass produce this show, make drastic vocal and musical changes, and slip it past an uncaring -or so they hope- and unknowing populace just happy to have the product.

Cold Case is my wife's favorite show.  When I saw the Paramount logo at the end of an episode, I told her ""Uh oh.  Fasten your seat belt because this is going to be a slow, painful trip"".

With all of the bows Cold Case makes to great music and actors of the past, I see radical surgery on the horizon.  Compliments of your favorite family DVD doctor and mine, Paramount.

So call in the family.  Tell them if they want to see Cold Case as they know it, they'd better view it and record it now in prime time.  Because if they don't...

I'm afraid to think about it.",1259107200,5,1407,4.2293233082706765
1560191,5,B00005JO9K,"This isn't called the internet (international network) for nothing.

Because of the greed for additional royalties in DVD sales (particularly from the Musician's Union (an organization I refuse to join)), the makers of this series flat out refuse to release this series, and even if they did, the series would be way too overpriced (example is the movie Woodstock, where demands were made by artists that caused a lot of editing of the movie, IE: Creedence and The Band,that we never saw these parts).

The above pertains to products INSIDE the US, not OUTSIDE the US. The internet does have iOffers OUTSIDE the US. Read other reviews, and poke around.

I pleasantly suprised with the excellent production of the program sans commercials. There are chinese subtitles on the beginning dvd's but as you get further into the seasons the subtitles are in english. The music that is the signature trademark of the show can not be beat. If you want to read the music credits etc. you will be disappointed after the first season's dvd. I ordered 2 extra COLD CASE SEASONS 1-6 (unknowingly). Rather than send them back I  want to give other DIE HARDS the opportunity to own this wonderful show. Now all I have to do is figure out how to do it through AMAZON.

It is unlike any other crime drama out there. One of my favorite episodes was the one where they solved a murder from 1947...This show takes you back in time, and sometimes leaves you in tears over what went on in the era the crime took place in because the producers give a viewer a feel for what went on back back in those days--everything from social mores to the political climate...Even if you weren't born yet, you'll often be left in tears of empathy for various characters because of what they endured. This show makes a viewer connect with characters, and if they empathize it's usually because of something going on in their own lives at the moment, or something they or someone they knew experienced...

I do hope they quit dilly-dallying on the release of these...I'm ready for them YESTERDAY!

Anyway, anyone can watch Law and Order, CSI and such and see that Jack Webb's influence lives on in the characters portrayed. For example, you can see a little Reed & Malloy in Stabler & Benson...These characters in Cold Case have the same heart and soul of Reed and Malloy, but unlike Adam-12, a viewer gets a glimpse of some of their personal demons and skeletons in the closet in order to get complete understanding of what is going on in their lives in the present--even if they deal with crimes decades old...",1239753600,2,1522,4.507246376811594

The cast is exceptionally talented and it is a pleasure to see them create their characters and, as the seasons go on, watch the characters evolve personally & as a team.

One reviewer mentioned the music and I have to totally agree. If the original songs and music are not used it will ruin the series. It is a very important part of its appeal and the end song kind of pulls everything together. On a recent rerun the end song was ""Broken Hearted Me"" by Anne Murray. It was very touching.

Unfortunately one of the reasons to love this show may be the reason it is not on DVD. There are many shows that cannot be released due to copyright issues. From what I understand that is one of the reasons that another great show ""China Beach"" is not available on DVD.

Let's just hope that whatever the problems are they are resolved so this wonderful show will be released to its adoring public, with the original music!!!!!!!

Aren't they special?

If they're going to use the excuse that music rights are the reason for the hold up, that doesn't wash. In today's day and age, dvd sales of a show is just as integral to a program's profitablity and longevity as it is to broadcast. Like many other shows, the music is important to the episode so when producers have an episode go into production and they license a song to be featured in an episode for broadcast, they may as well INCLUDE IN THE CONTRACT that the license extends into dvd production as well.

To have to license the music first for broadcast into the episode, then again if and when the show goes into dvd is ridiculous. It's double work and holds up dvd sales. Licensing them both at the same time on the same contract  also lets a producer know way ahead of time if the music copyright holder is getting too greedy, they can pick another song for the episode and no music has to be replaced.

The music is what makes this show so special, because while watching the show, the music makes you feel like you are actually there.

The show is sentimental, but this is what makes it so special. The show is realistic in the sense that, they do not always end happily and they do not always catch the bad guys.

1560770,5,B00005JO9K,"I've always loved cop dramas and forensic mystery shows, and for the past four years ""Cold Case"" has been on my list of favorites.  However, this year (2006-2007 season) my top pick ""CSI"" jumped the shark, and ""Without A Trace"" seems to be circling that same shark, so ""Cold Case"" has steadily climbed up that list, and here's why:

I've always loved how ""Cold Case"" does the ""period"" parts of the show-- like when they flash back to a really old case, and everyone is dressed and speaks like its 1960. I have no firsthand knowledge to know if its accurate, but it looks that way to me.  They integrate perfect music choices (with the exception of Season 4's ""The Red and the Blue"" which went overboard using a Tim McGraw soundtrack)-- both new charttoppers and oldies but goodies-- for any scene, any mood, and any theme.

I also love the color saturation on the show. Its shot like a typical millenium cop drama: lots of jump shots and close ups and whatever, but the way they play with color is really fun.  Everything in the precinct is this cold, harsh blue, not unlike real fluorescent lighting, but flashbacks of the victims are always vibrant: red and green, and sometimes different layers of both in one frame (most recent example of this is ""Knuckle Up"" which aired on January 7 2007).  And I don't even watch it on an HDTV, so I don't even get the BEST picture.

In four years, they haven't strayed from their formula, and it still hasn't gotten stale. They don't feel the need to push their detectives together romantically, and even though they show a tiny bit of their personal lives, it never feels like a forced storyline.  It's a true dramatic serial, which is rare now.

They get amazing guest stars, and even when those stars are unknown, they're really talented.  They also do some pretty unique stories-- a few weeks ago they did one called ""Forever Blue"" about two male cops in the 60s who fell in love with each other, one of whom was killed for it.  Plus, I end up crying every week, even if I've seen the episode already.

I signed up for an alert almost two years ago to find out when this item was being release on DVD, and the studios have yet to announce it.  The ratings have increased with it being paired with ""Without A Trace"" on Sunday nights, so I think it's time!  RELEASE ""COLD CASE"" ON DVD!",1168300800,36,2328,4.472813238770685
1560771,5,B00005JO9K,"i believe that the reason why both cold case and without a trace are so slow in coming out is that tnt airs both shows on its network which means they don't think that  its worth their while to put it out immediately.i could understand how it could be about the songs with cold case but that isn't the case with without a trace and since they already air on tnt,it might be a long time in coming.",1168214400,5,396,4.076923076923077

Why producers don't get the rights to the music for future DVD release is a complete mystery to me. I suppose it has to do with additional royalties that they would have to pay before they know whether they will have a hit with staying power. But I gotta say, as a fan, it's very frustrating to love a show because of its musical production values and know at the same time that it will never be released on DVD with the same music that made me love it.",1166227200,10,685,4.359375
1560862,5,B00005JO9K,"A lot of reviewers are asking why this set is taking so long to release on DVD.  The reason why is the music and licensing involved.  Read on . . .

One has to admit that Cold Case is willfully sentimental.  If you don't like your heart strings being tugged then you won't like this show.  But for those of us who do, this is one of the better programs on network television.

Besides original plots, one of the reasons Cold Case is so successful is its use of music to place a story in a specific time.  If it's the 1940s you might hear big band music.  If it's the 80s it might be fluffy techno rock.  For anyone who's lived through the period being depicted, this use of music can bring on a flood of associated memories.  We feel what's being shown on the screen because we've been there.  And even if we haven't, using period piece music is just good television.

This is a warning to both the producers and, more importantly, anyone buys this disc.  If you want a warning of what they might do, just look at Quantum Leap.  Because of various copyright holders who were too greedy to allow their music to be used on the DVD, QL was released without many of its original songs.  It ruined the show for many of us who liked the show in its original form.

Cold Case has far more music than Quantum Leap ever had.  So buyer beware - the producers might try to rip us off and sell us the show without one of the primary reasons we like it in the first place.

And producer beware - if you want us to buy your product, sell us the show we love to watch.  We're not interested in some faux copy.  Failing to do so WILL harm your bottom line.  I know I have never purchased a Quantum Leap set because of this issue and I won't buy a Cold Case set either if it's been edited from its original version.",1165795200,605,1798,4.138728323699422

This is a popular show that has been in the ratings top ten many times. It may be a 'crime drama', but it's not like the other procedurals on television. Cold Case has more of a heart and the detectives, particularly the lead, Lily Rush, often feel emotionally invested in the cases they're solving. We also get to see bits and pieces of their personal lives every so often, which makes the show a little more interesting. Plus, I enjoy the flashback scenes that give us insight on the murders because they treat the victims like human beings rather than 'cases' and I always look forward to the end when the murderer is revealed and they play a song from the year the person was killed. It's surprising that after three seasons a show like this would still hold my interest, but it does. They keep coming up with new twists and well-written episodes that still get to me.

One of the best aspects of Cold Case, as many have already said, is the music, which transports you into the past, to the time of the  unsolved murder. For example, in my very favourite episode, the recent ""A Perfect Day"", the scene is set in the 60s, with well-known music from artists such as Donovan, The Byrds and The Shirelles.

However, the downside of this is that its taking soooooo long for the show to be released on DVD, because of the music rights. Hopefully, it will be released eventually and even if this takes a long time, it'll be worth the wait!",1147651200,21,822,4.503355704697986
