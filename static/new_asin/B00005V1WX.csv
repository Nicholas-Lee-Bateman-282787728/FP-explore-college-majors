7955841,3,B00005V1WX,"This DVD release of the cartoon series could have been better.  It's lacking the first few seconds of each of the three episodes on it.  There's still enough that you can piece it together but it comes of as a little disjointed.  The included episodes are 4-6 entitled 'Enter the Viper,' 'Project A, for Astral,' and 'Shell Game.'",1273190400,,330,4.655172413793103

7955845,4,B00005V1WX,Jackie Chan the worlds most favorite action star is now a cartoon? Well jackie is as good as a cartoon as an action star. In this version of Jackie Chan Adventures he and his neace jade are trying to find some more of the talismans. But the Dark hand is always trying to stop them. This Dvd has two half-hour packed action shows on it.,1062720000,3,335,4.1692307692307695

I would give a higher rating than 3 stars if they would come out with the rest of the series on dvd.
You can get the entire run of season 1 on vhs!!
Why not on dvd!!
Pick up the pace Sony!!",1044230400,9,211,3.608695652173913
