4262630,5,B00455XFOY,Fascinating insight into songs and their writers and the life of a unique artist who is so passionate about his art. A joy to watch which brought tears and smiles in equal measure. Let's hope there are many more to this series to add to the brilliance of the first three. My only criticism was that it was not long enough!,1386115200,,322,4.295081967213115
4262631,5,B00455XFOY,It was a gift and the recipients loved it.  I will be ordering the next 2 seasons for Christmas or birthdays.,1383609600,,109,4.190476190476191
4262632,5,B00455XFOY,"Michael takes us throough the decades of American music...from Irving Berlin, to Cole Porter and Johnny Mercer.  I can't imagine a better way to pass a few hours than by watching these DVD's!",1372896000,3,191,4.787878787878788
4262633,5,B00455XFOY,"HE IS AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMER  AND A TRUE LOVER OF MUSIC FROM THE GOLDEN BROADWAY ERA

CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS MUSIC COLLECTION!",1370390400,,130,4.608695652173913
4262634,5,B00455XFOY,I really enjoyed this third season particularly the Angela Lansbury contribution and also Michael's continuing search to unearth rare musical gems. A great series of programs that can be watched over and over again.,1369612800,3,215,5.352941176470588
4262635,5,B00455XFOY,"I loved this DVD so much ,I have been raised listening to all the great American composers  and big dance bands as well as the early English bands and singers of the 19.00  onwards as my father had a great love of this music and my late mother. Loved films and musicals and had a great knoll age of such  I love the passion that Michael has for keeping the music of the great American song book alive  , and that he shared how it has affected and shaped his life  It met all my expectations.  I will enjoy adding to the series",1368230400,2,526,4.058252427184466
4262636,5,B00455XFOY,"This is a WONDERFUL DVD of Michael and the Great American Songbook.  We get to see rare video and audio of this era.  Michael goes beyond being 'just' a collector of this music, but also performs admirably at several spots on the video.  He interviews people and you can see their reaction as they talk with him -  the years seem to melt away.  The Bonus DVD is worth the price alone - it contains many 'lost' videos of wonderful performances and yes - I really was singing along with the bouncing ball.  I am also a pianist and play much of the music of this era.  In addition I play in a German band - which includes music just before this era.  And like Michael, I see the audiences getting older and smaller each year.  We desperately NEED more people like Michael Feinstein to collect this material - and also share it with a wider audience.  This is a valuable addition to my DVD collection.  Video and audio have been enhanced to look and sound very well on today's equipment.  Michael is seen in a variety of performance situations - both as soloist and as singer.  He does it all well.  You also get an idea of what is needed behind the scenes to make these performances happen.  I heartily recommend this collection.",1340668800,15,1226,4.410714285714286
4262637,5,B00455XFOY,"Feinstein is one of the most knowledgeable historians of pop music, and these 3 CDs are full of ACCURATE information (not what you will usually encounter in surveys which claim to be histories).  Yes, they are also about his life both personal and professional, so if you don't want to know what it's like to be a obsessive collector and historian like Michael, then you may not like these CDs. His views are well expressed and supported by some excellent, rare footage of performers from the 1920's through the 1940's. By the way, he is also a remarkably gifted pianist and singer, but the CDs are not predominantly about his performing. Even those who are not lovers of his performing will find much to enjoy here! Finally, these are the most beautifully produced DVDs I have ever seen!",1298419200,28,788,4.7101449275362315
4262638,2,B00455XFOY,"I would call this less a songbook, and more a very self-indulgent auto-biography of Feinstein.  May I return it?",1296000000,3,112,4.894736842105263
4262639,5,B00455XFOY,"Wonderful documentary with lots of info about various artists, music & how important it is to retain film clips etc. for the kids that are growing up now but haven't had the opportunity to hear GOOD music, lyrics & singers that you can understand.  Really enjoyable to listen to.",1290988800,31,279,4.6938775510204085
8416517,3,B00455XFOY,"Some of the excerpts are very good.
Evidently Feinstein is unaware that country songs and Western songs exist.
He leaves out the pop songs of the fifties.
The most popular and most enduring of the songs seem not to exist for Feinstein: hymns.
I do love musicals, but dislike distorted history, so I don't like this video.",1454716800,,321,4.649122807017544
8416518,5,B00455XFOY,"This is a great three-part cd (originally broadcast on PBS) on Michael Feinstein.  It is a documentary so you get a look at Feinstein's life, interviews with his parents, snippets of concert appearances, etc.  I think it is an excellent documentary and have watched it twice in the period of 30 days.",1453161600,,300,4.75
8416519,5,B00455XFOY,"Excellent video - interesting, fun and great music.  My 91 year old father even loves it!",1449964800,,89,4.5625
8416520,5,B00455XFOY,"I want to publicly thank Hudson West Productions for making this  set available !
This music is super important to me ; it fascinates me SO MUCH; the people the times . . .

Mr. Feinstein : Keep up the great work.  I'm with yah man.
I am only part way through the first Episode so I can't really review the whole deal yet but I wanted to stop and write this.  I have seen parts of these from time to time on PBS but never had the pleasure of starting from the beginning.

While I was waiting for these Bluerays to arrive in the mail It surprised me how excited I became to dig into all this music and info.  I haven't been as enthusiastic about an area of study for some time.
Man this is great.

For anyone who is even mildly interested in the big bands, the American Songbook writers and performers . . .
YOU CAN'T DO BETTER THAN THIS !
What a treasure.  I listen to a lot of different music :  from my main love JAZZ, to country, classical . . . Rock . . . The Drive By Tuckers . . . Blue Grass . . .
But I can't remember a time when I wasn't mesmerized by Glenn Miller, Big Bands, Rosemary Clooney  that whole scene,  I mean from the time I was six years old . . .
I can add fifty years to that now and I am even more moved by it now.  What a thrill to finally be able to watch and learn about it all from Michael Feinstein.  And by the way he is first class at performing what he is teaching us about and he learned from some of the best.

BUY THIS.  For sure.",1447372800,,1465,3.8528428093645486
8416521,4,B00455XFOY,"It is an interesting history of popular music but tells as much about Michael Feinstein as it does the music.  It explains a little too much  how Michael Feinstein does his research and should concentrate more on the music itself and the singers.  The bonus disc, however, is a joy.  Anybody with an interest in music from the '30's, '40's and '50's  will enjoy this disc.",1444089600,,372,4.575757575757576
