8033107,2,B0002VI9BO,"I agree with the review that says this CD is of no use if you expect learning something from it. If time is short to talk about all these techniques then why not leave some subjects out of the presentation and work on producing a more meaningful one.
Also, a few weeks ago I purchased a distance healing session with Ron himself. I was told to download Skype for that purpose, which I did. Two days later I was told that the sessions were no longer performed through Skype and neither by phone. Disappointed, I was forced to ""trust"" that it would be performed at the day and time I had scheduled it. No guidelines were provided as to how should I proceed at the time of the ""session"", so I decided to meditate on my own. At the time of my ""healing"", (about an hour) I experienced nothing more than what I usually do while meditating - a profound relaxation. Nothing more.  A few hours later that day, I received an email from Ron saying that I had a few of my chakras ""closed"" and that could be the cause of my physical problems...When I asked him about how to proceed, he told me to go to his online store and buy one of his CDs that teaches how to work with chakras... In a few words, I am supposed to work on my chakras and of course, try to heal myself... I mean duhhh... Don't charge people for a ""HEALING"" session if you have no intention, or no ability  to heal that person or at least to provide some relief....
I LOVE learning about self-healing and I love learning about my own body and Spirit. But that's not what I expected from his Healing ""Session""... He left me very frustrated and I'll never recommend him to anybody... Ron's ""healing"" sessions according to my own experience, are a fraud.",1521763200,,1705,4.325

8033109,3,B0002VI9BO,"Unfortunately Steel guitars come in many varieties with 6, 8 10 or 12 string varieties.
I was using an 8 string peddle steel tuned to E9 but there wasn't much material on this video that I could use.
Cindy Cashdollar plays very well but the tuning she used was useless for my needs.",1405036800,2,282,4.339622641509434
8033110,5,B0002VI9BO,Great video. I will say this it is NOT for a true beginner. If you are a pro or semi pro guitar player or any stringed instrument this is right up your ally. You will have to know the Nashville number system cause she calls out numbers a lot. She uses a lot of Chord inversions. but if you don't know what a chord inversions is it will be a problem. She doesn't explain those things. She expects you to already know it. Not many people's first instrument is a lap steel so maybe that's why Cindy expects people to have  basic  music theory. If you never played a instrument before and looking for a video I would recommend a different video to get started and get this one after you get some basics down. A beginnier watching this video will get overwhelmed and frustrated quick.,1370649600,6,779,4.328767123287672
8033111,1,B0002VI9BO,"Great DVD if u want to listen to some great steel guitar work, but this is not a good teaching dvd, Cindy goes to fast and plays more than teaches.",1330214400,8,147,3.933333333333333
8033112,2,B0002VI9BO,"This set of two Tabla DVDs serve more as a show than as a learning tool.  Lot of spoken words describing the Tabla ""Bols"" and ""Taals"" but no written words are displayed.  The ""teacher"" just says the taals and then plays them quite fast; therefore they are very difficult to follow. I have played Tabla before, and currently taking lessons with an expert Tabla teacher, yet I have found these DVDs useless as a learning aid.  Also, often sound and video signals are not synchronized, so the hand movements either lag or lead the sound. I would not recommend this set of DVDs (Vols 1 & 2) as a learning tool.",1278201600,5,606,4.441441441441442
8033113,4,B0002VI9BO,Well done. Could have been a little more detailed and at a little slower pace for the true beginner.,1210204800,11,100,4.315789473684211
8033114,4,B0002VI9BO,"I bought myself an 8-string lap steel, and discovered very soon that I was unable to figure it out although I've played standard guitar for abt 15 years. When getting the DVD I very soon got a better grip on the instrument, and the lessons are built up in a way that I find useful and interresting. As my native language is Norwegian I also found it interresting to be able to pick up the english music terms that Cindy uses.",1171670400,9,425,4.2592592592592595
