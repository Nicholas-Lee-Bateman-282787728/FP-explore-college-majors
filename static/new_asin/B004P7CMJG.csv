8437536,4,B004P7CMJG,"It was hard to figure out how to rate this item. Equilibrium is great! However,  Renaissance is not great. I would give Equilibrium 5 stars by itself, but if you can get it cheaper alone, you should.

That being said, these things could be a matter of taste. Whereas, Equilibrium is a well-acted clever twist on Fahrenheit 451, Renaissance is a cartoon - a very long sophisticated cartoon, but a cartoon none the less. Not my cup of tea.",1411776000,,437,4.518987341772152
8437537,5,B004P7CMJG,"Fahrenheit was a book full of symbols and allegories in which this movie took to heart as it mixed in some Philip Dick literary themes at the same time. Sure, the movie took themes from some fiction books, some of the best books ever written. So enjoy the movie Equilibrium as an extra to your Bradbury and Dick book collection.",1378080000,,328,4.483333333333333

8437539,5,B004P7CMJG,"Equilibrium has been a long held favorite of mine. I've not yet had the chance to watch Renaissance, but anything coupled with Equilibrium has to be good. Watched with 3 of my friends and all of them loved it.",1349222400,,209,4.384615384615385
