8026111,1,B0002CR0D6,"I have purchased this movie because I am a fan of independent German films. However, this movie was the worse German movie I have ever purchased. The movie is predictable and most of the times boring and I yawned from beginning to end. Nevertheless, the actors tried to make the best out of a terrible script. The reason I put a star was because it won't allow me to give it a zero. Don't waste your money not even for a rental.",1358121600,,428,4.2317073170731705
