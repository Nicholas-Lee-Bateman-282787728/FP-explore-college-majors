5324931,2,B009GCIIKM,"Scott W. Mckinlay has seen one too many Troma movies... And we mean that in the best possible way! CREEP VAN is an outrageous, over-the-top splatterfest that throws back to the glory days of the 1980's. The absurdity of each kill is only exceeded by the ridiculous amount of bloody gore as the Creep Van bisects unsuspecting thieves, bashes brains in, and mows down anyone that gets in its way. Oh, and there's even a bit of a plot squeezed in there, too. Campbell is down on his luck after moving back from the city, so he takes a job at the car wash while saving up for a new car. Unfortunately for him, the only car he can afford is THE CREEP VAN! Cue the emphatic music. CREEP VAN is crass, vulgar, and utterly tasteless from the very start, making no attempt to hide its sleazy B-movie roots with its many in-jokes and cameos. Thankfully, it's all in good fun, and the stupid humor equals plenty of guilty laughs. It's time to buckle in for a gory good time with CREEP VAN!

The movie starts out pretty good but after the first 5 minutes, I don't know what happened. all I can say is the movie tanked, went off the cliff, evaporated.",1359331200,,314,4.163934426229508

5324934,4,B009GCIIKM,Fun flick with some fantastic practical effects done by Robert Hall (Laid to Rest & Chromeskull: Laid to Rest 2). Definitely recommended to horror fans looking for an entertaining time!,1358208000,2,185,5.2
5324935,3,B009GCIIKM,"Creep Van is a humorous slasher flick about a loser named Campbell played by the very Hot 'Brian Kolodziej' Campbell needs a car, 1he sees a for sale sign in an old raggedy van so he calls to inquire about it and soon the Creep starts to stalk him and everyone he knows.

There are quite a few colorful and hilarious characters thrown in the mix that help the film move along at a nice pace.

There is quite a bit of fun and well done gore in this low budget slasher and lots of funny Dialogue and visuals that will have you laughing out loud as well.
The acting is nothing to write home about but good enough to keep your interest and the story is satisfying enough for the die hard slasher fan.

The ending is pretty cliche' but all in all I enjoyed it and would watch it again .",1356912000,2,781,4.091503267973856
5324936,4,B009GCIIKM,"I love horror movies, but when I saw this title at Redbox I figured a movie with a title called Creep van couldn't be good. So I read some reviews and all of the reviews were positive, so I decided to rent Creep Van.  This movie is like a 80's throwback kinda like Halloween or Friday the 13th and I like those horror movies the most.  Theres no crazy twist or special effects just blood and gore.  The acting isn't the best but it's passable. I wish more horror movie directors would go this route instead of the so called haunted house movies. I would recommened this movie to any horror fan.",1356220800,5,594,4.285714285714286
5324937,5,B009GCIIKM,"Creep Van is a new slasher film with a unique twist. It's about a man who drives a van, and kills pretty much anyone who either approaches the van or enters the van looking for a ride. There is plenty of gore, some t & a, and some funny moments as well. And it does have its share of creeps. Whenever the van and the van's driver is onscreen, Creep Van is pure fun. This film really surprised me. I expected to like it, but I didn't expect to love it. On the cover of the box, it says that this is ""A scary homage to '80's horror movies"". But in no way is this a rip-off. It is an original film that has many unexpected twists. An independent gem!",1356048000,5,647,3.9846153846153847

5324951,2,B009GCIIKM,"Creep Van is set and shot in the Detroit area where I am from and its always great to have films shot in your area.  Creep Van is one part 1970s comedy Car Wash, one part evil car movie, and one part SAWhows that for an eclectic stew?  Campbell is a down on his luck guy whose life is complicated by not having a car.  After failing at several jobs the only employment he can find is at a Detroit car wash.

Like the 1970s comedy Car Wash part of the charm of Creep Van is that the film is populated with a diverse group of goofball characters.  Campbells two co-workers are pothead slackers; his roommate wears Luchador costumes and has sex with women in a doghouse; and then there is a small-time gangster/Swami who runs a hippie-like cult and apparently sells pot on the side.

The absurdity of the characters and situations is contrasted by a mysterious, rundown old van whose owner has turned it into a deathtrap on wheels.  Metal blades come down and slice victims in half in the windows; pulleys attached to the seatbelts squeeze the life out of seat occupants; spikes shoot through the back of the carseats to impale people; and, well, you get the picture.

The Creep puts a for sale sign on the van to attract his victims and Campbell finds himself caught up in the deadly game when he calls about buying the van.  Soon he an new girlfriend Amy are fighting for their lives against the man and his van of horrors.

Separately as a straight horror or straight comedy there are a couple of good films here.  The problem is the two elements don't blend all that well.  Despite some excessively gory kills its hard to take the action all that serious with the rest of the silliness going on.  Add to that theres some serious gaffs.  Brian says he lives in Mount Clemens (a suburb about a  north of Detroit) yet when his roommate is killed the cops say they are from the Detroit Police Departmentbut they are driving Wayne Country Sheriff cruisers.  And while the car wash he works at is supposed to be in Detroit, we clearly see a sign in the background that reads 12 Mile Rod which would place it four miles outside of the Detroit city limits.

So ok, unless you're from the area you're not going to notice these mistakes but it still means lazy and shoddy filmmaking as all of these elements would have been easily fixable.  The performances aren't terrible.  Some, like Collin Bernsen as Swami Ted, are quite fun.  Ultimately Creep Van is just too uneven to rise above mediocre.",1438387200,,2486,4.470066518847006
5324952,2,B009GCIIKM,Pretty bad.,1436745600,,11,5.0
5324953,3,B009GCIIKM,"For me the film comes off a little more tongue-in-cheek corny than I would have liked to see with a film that is this bold and original. The acting is just a big cheesy which gives a strong comedic vibe but not so much that it sucks. You just get a too obvious since that everyone around this project knows how B-movie this thing is which takes away from the darkness too much. It really is a horror comedy minus tack sound effects. For me that is the only thing that doesnt quite fit with this film. Creep Van has some awesome and gory kill scenes and when it comes to psychos The Creep in this movie is as brutal and unrelenting as any. It is the saving grace of the whole film.

This movie is an obvious homage to early 80s films that blend Madman like atmosphere and horror with the truly twisted humor of Maniac Cop. I wouldnt say that this movie is scary as hell but it is an enjoyable film that brings the blood. There is enough going right for Creep Van to warrant seeing. This is something that is against a lot of reviews I have seen online about the film that consider the movie crap. Yeah there are some crappy things happening here but taken on its entirety this film manages to entertain and ride that cult classic gory feel from start to end.",1433462400,,1257,4.2375

Set in a depressed Detroit, it has that same feel of the porous border between the bottom tier of the American working class and the criminal underworld that you get in movies from Repo Man to Hanger. And good old Lloyd Kaufman makes a cameo as a gay co-owner of a vintage car. This is not a fast-paced film, but the plot is engaging, the actors are very fun to watch, and the kills are just brutal.",1413331200,,409,4.189873417721519

5324959,2,B009GCIIKM,"It kicks off well enough, and held my attention for a bit. But this movie just falls apart right in the middle and the ending just felt rushed. Maybe if it had spent less time with building the boring plot, it could've been something decent or memorable. The over the top gore was entertaining, but when it gets to the middle of the film, the horror stuff subsides and the romance completely takes over and that's where it became a borefest.

Nothing special.",1402531200,,459,4.530120481927711
5324960,1,B009GCIIKM,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched! The story was idiotic, the acting was horrendous! It was so awful it was humorous!",1394928000,,136,4.269230769230769
5324961,3,B009GCIIKM,"Its not that movies like CREEP VAN don't take horror seriously, its that I cant take the horror seriously in movies like CREEP VAN.

The premise is simple enough.  A down on his luck guy, Campbell Jackson, back in town, trying to make his way in the world, gets a job at a car wash.  Hes taking the bus to and from work, but he desperately wants to buy a car.  He sees a van for sale and calls about buying it.  The owner calls back and yells at him.  Campbell says forget it and moves on with his life, which includes dating the girl who works the front desk at the car wash.  Meanwhile, the owner of the van is going around town killing people with his booby trapped vehicle.  The seatbealt is rigged to tighten around whoever is clicked into the seat, theres a spiked hammer that swings up from the rear of the seat, a knife that shoots out of the seat back, spikes sticking out of the air bag, and the window works as a guillotine.

As the guy becomes more obsessed with harassing Campbell, our hero is less and less interested in buying the van.  But when his best friend is killed, then his girlfriend kidnapped, he has to do something to stop the murderous van owner.

See, with a title like CREEP VAN and a synopsis that includes the phrase booby trapped van, Im thinking of something like a miniature version of THE COLLECTOR, or something akin to the SAW movies.  I was pretty excited to watch this movie.  Until I watched it and saw its not being played for terror, but for laughs.  Not that CREEP VAN is made to be a knee-slapper, but its definitely more silliness than horror.

The tone is way too light, the kills are ridiculously far-fetched, and the acting from the supporting cast was so over the top all around it had to be on purpose.

I wanted to champion this movie, and instead I find myself wondering what I just did with the last 84 minutes and how my life has gone so completely off track.

Brian Kolodziej as Campbell does what he can with the material, but writer and director Jim Bartoo and Scott McKinley, respectively, are obviously just goofing around.  Youd think with the subject matter, they could have at least pretended to be taking this seriously.  Instead, I felt, at times, like I was watching a spoof and expected, at any moment, for someone to say, I am serious.  And don't call me Shirley.

The gore was pretty impressive--all the more reason its too bad CREEP VAN was more comedy than horror--and the kills, while dumb, at least played well on camera.  The climax was a shock for all of 30 seconds, but then played out exactly how youd expect it to given what happens in a very tense moment during the final fight.  While I was sort of let down by how obvious that ending was, there was a minute or two when you feel a hopelessness pressing in on you and it feels like such a bigger moment than it really is by virtue of the fact its the ONLY really dark moment of the entire movie.  Unfortunately, its too little, too late.

CREEP VAN does its namesake proud by luring you in with the promise of what you want--in this case a decent horror movie--and instead giving you something you weren't the least bit interested.  While Im not SORRY I watched it, I certainly cant recommend it to anyone else, without the warning that, if you like your horror movies with a serious tone, this isn't the one for you.",1391558400,,3347,4.366720516962843

5324963,5,B009GCIIKM,"This was all the blood and gore one could reasonably ask for in an hour and 20 minutes but without the inconvenience of being frightened by scary bits and without having to pay real close attention to know what's going on.

Plus, if you've ever wondered what a head would look like after the face has been sheared off by a malfunctioning car window, you need to watch this movie.  I think the special effects were great.  Acting not so bad either. Go Detroit!",1381622400,,459,4.440476190476191
5324964,4,B009GCIIKM,"I'm grading this film on a curve, with the idea that it will appeal to folks who like low budget, 70s retro horror. In other words, a drive-in movie. Otherwise, i'd be talking about rough edges that include disjointed story telling and unexplained coincidences.
As an aside, i'd also like to suggest that actor Brian Kolodziej fire whoever advised him to have his eyebrows waxed like a drag queen.",1367366400,,397,4.768115942028985
5324965,4,B009GCIIKM,"it seems today in horror they are going back to when the slasher flick, exploitation flick was golden. The 80's. Who didn't like the so bad and cheesy slasher flicks of the 80's. I was but a young lad when i got my first glimpse of the wonderful world of 80's slasher. I remember watching Nightmare 4&5 in the movie theatre. Silent Night Deadly Night was rented once around Christmas time when i was three or so. That movie still sticks with me and became a Christmas tradition with me. So you get my point. I'm glad they are doing throwback films of the 80's. This movie reminds me of that time. It didn't seem too different from the vhs movies my parents would rent and watch. I could imagine watching this back in 1985 and it would just feel the same. Pick this movie up if you love the horror movies of the 80's. But don't take it too seriously or you won't enjoy it. Two things that stick out in my head is this one scene where the lead guy Campbell i think his name is pictures himself buying The Creep Van. And then picking up this girl he works with and parking by the beach. Things are getting good and then the girl in the passenger seat becomes a dude. He snaps out of that daydream and is like ""what the hell was that."" Anyways i think that is what the scene was suppose to be and it's funny. Another scene that sticks out for me is at the end the villian sticks his head into the window of the Creep Van and our main guy closes the window on him effectively slicing off his face. That scene was great and i believe it will stick out for you too. There are many many more hilarious moments that i won't spoil for you. Just pick this movie up and enjoy it for what it is.",1363651200,,1682,4.1310975609756095

5324967,4,B009GCIIKM,"The movie as a whole is a pretty standard throw-back to the golden years of 80s horror. But there are couple of scenes that earn this flick 4/5. First off, it's hilarious and will entertain you the entire time. Second, if you're an indy filmmaker, you'll be inspired. It joins the few low budget horror films that pull-off a much higher quality than expected.

If nothing else. watch the scene with the loquacious fellow who joins the creeper after being stranded by his shoddy Harley. You'll laugh your guts out.",1361232000,2,513,4.7

Why are there so many criticisms for a film that is a self parody? It is paying homage and making fun of 80s slasher films. Great fun film that is not meant to scare or be taken seriously.

Wehrell is charming and engaging (not to mention lovely to look at) and the one bright spot in a movie otherwise filled with gory, painful death scenes, which are creatively done and probably enjoyable if that's your thing, but it isn't mine.
