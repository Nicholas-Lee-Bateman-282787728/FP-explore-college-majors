1879227,5,B0000950WB,"I was originally NOT going to give Bartleby 5 stars, but with all the bad reviews here, I thought I would even things out a bit. I think a lot of people just didn't get it, although granted the short story by Herman Melville that Bartleby is based on is certainly a lot easier relate to.  The movie was sort of parody thereof. It been suggested that Bartleby is suffering from soul sickness. That he is dead inside from all the years spent at the dead letter office.  He is just existing on existence's most minimalist level.  He'd ""prefer not to""  because he realizes the futility of it all.  I think the biggest problem with the movie was that they were trying to turn something heavy into a ""comedy"" when clearly the label doesn't apply.

The acting I thought was great especially Crispin Glover and Glenne Headly. Also the colors that they used were fantastic, Crispin Glover was literally black and white , in fact I am sure they used makeup on Crispin, there is no way he is that pale.

Overall highly recommend if you are looking for something a bit different.",1087257600,20,1067,4.4974093264248705

1879229,3,B0000950WB,"Based upon the story, ""Bartleby, the Scrivener"" by Herman Melville, this film adaptation of the author's mid-nineteenth century tale of existential alienation  is effectively transposed to the twenty first century by its screenwriters, Catherine Napoli and Jonathan Parker.
Featuring a stellar cast and deft direction, the film takes place in an office building perched high up on a hill, which is inaccessible to pedestrians. Isolated and insular, this building houses a public records firm run by an unnamed boss (David Paymer). The film is staffed by Vivian (Glenn Headley), a sexy, flirtatious secretary, Rocky (Joe Piscopo), self-styled ladies man, and Ernie (Maury Chaykin), a sad sack sort of fellow.
When the boss gets a city contract, he seeks to hire another employee. Enter Bartleby (Crispin Glover), a cadaverously pale, funereally dressed  man. As there are no other applicants, the slightly creepy Bartleby gets the job. An odd duck, he initially works as if he were a house on fire. As time goes on, his boss discovers that Bartleby prefers not to do any work. This sets off a reaction from all those who work with Bartleby, whose life spirals ever downward with his decision to withdraw from the world.
Crispin Glover, David Paymer, and Glenn Headly are brilliant in their respective roles. The more peripheral office characters, unfortunately, have little to work with, though they do their best with the material with which they have to work. Their roles, however, are one dimensional and add little to the film in terms of depth.
This off-beat, quirky film also resonates with dissonance through the use of bright, odd color combinations for its sets. It serves to keep the film a tad off balance, which works effectively given its premise. In the end, however, the film fails to sustain itself fully, as it starts a spiral downward towards the end, unable to sustain the weight of its own ballast.",1063411200,4,1917,5.044164037854889
1879230,4,B0000950WB,"No need to rehash the plot. But this story manages to reflect Melville (a story I found exquistite, not dull at all) incredibly well.
The line between comedy and tragedy is a blurry one. What makes us laugh can also make us cringe, and this story beautifully blurs that line as it gets under your skin in a creepy way. We see the disintegration of a person who chooses to opt out of life. At first it's funny, then weird, then irritating. But for the protagonist, it's disastrous.
No easy way out for the characters, who begin as cartoons and end as real people. No easy way out for us either. Life doesn't offer a sideline, though many people scurry about in quest for it. If you're here, you gotta play. The film shows that wonderfully.",1057017600,2,738,4.4338235294117645

1879234,5,B0000950WB,"Jonathan Parker's treatment of Herman Melville's famous short story, ""Bartleby the Scrivener,"" is as clever as it is haunting. David Paymer is the perfect foil to Crispin Glover's anti-antics, a man who has somehow lost all but his body, nearly catatonic, increasingly refusing to do any work in a dead-end office within a stagnant society in which only appearances matter. Parker's updating of Melville's classic is a must see for anyone studying the short story; this is a great film for the literature, philosophy, psychology, or sociology classroom.",1448841600,2,553,5.295454545454546

1879243,4,B0000950WB,"If you enjoyed Office Space there is a good chance that you will find Bartleby amusing. The film perfectly captures the futility of most office work.  Bartleby is hired because the office manager sees the need for more help. The morose looking Bartleby (played by Crispin Glover) is a model employee who at first causes resentment from the other office workers due to his diligence. He even makes the flirtatious secretary concerned enough to be overly attentive to the boss.

However, things take a drastic turn when Bartleby suddenly refuses to do simple tasks in the office. When asked to do something Bartleby simply says, ""I prefer not to"".  Soon Bartleby refuses to do any work at all and repeats the same phrase, ""I prefer not to"" anytime he is asked to work. Soon the only thing that appeals to Bartleby is staring at the ceiling fan.

Some have said that Bartleby is simply rebelling against the corporate establishment and is refusing to be a cog in the wheel. I don't really agree with this conclusion, because there are far more effective ways to rebel against the establishment. Bartleby's obstinacy is more of a personality trait. Maybe Herman Melville, who wrote the story in the 19th century, was actually describing an autistic person before there was a definition of one.  In some ways Bartley is like a computer slowly shutting down, much in the way Hal was lobotomized in 2001. Soon the most basic functions elude Bartleby.

The boss, played sympathetically by David Paymer eventually follows Bartleby to a homeless refuge under a bridge. He tries to bring him food only to find Bartleby has starved to death. I think Melville is leaving it up to the audience to figure out what caused Bartleby's eventually demise.

You could look at the movie and novel as a tragedy, but many will see it as a satire on modern corporate life.",1334016000,3,1847,4.77115987460815
1879244,4,B0000950WB,"""Bartleby"", the first film directed and written by Jonathan Parker is a real gem - modern version of the Melville's short story ""Bartleby the Scrivener"" with absolutely amazing cast.

Crispin Glover plays Bartleby, the man who was hired, but preferred not to work and who was fired, but preferred not to leave. David Paymer is his clueless boss who tries to understand what he is dealing with. Glenne Headly is Vivian, an office secretary, the woman of many adorable talents; Maury Chaykin, and Joe Piscopo are his coworkers in the one of the most boring office ever existed. The office is located in the building that sits on the top of the hill and comes directly from the El Greco's painting ""View of Toledo"" with its atmosphere of mystery, danger, and loneliness: Would you like to work in the building like that? I'd prefer not to...

I believe Parker made a very impressive debut - the film is creatively shot, the use of music is amazing - Beethoven's sonata turns into a creepy, quirky and moody Bartleby's theme for which Parker used theremin - very interesting and unique musical instrument. Parker and his co -writer transported 'Bartleby the Scrivener' into a surreal and absurd black comedy - satire on bureaucracy and contemporary alienation in the insane and cruel world.

Franz Kafka's name came to my mind more than once while watching the film - he would've loved that absurd, funny but dark and sad story. Also, if ever a good movie is made about one of the greatest and tragic writers of 20th Century, Crispin Glover should play him. Just compare their pictures...",1176076800,,1584,4.794871794871795
1879245,4,B0000950WB,"""I'd prefer not to."" That is Bartleby, the new office worker's, constant refrain, when asked to perform tasks at work. And then when he's fired and asked to leave as well. It seems that really Bartleby would prefer not to do anything.

Crispin Glover portrays the enigmatic Bartleby with the creepy calmness that is his specialty. This film is really what an independent film should be. It's clear that the budget is low, the sets are simple, the cast small, but the performances and script make this film superb.

Having not read the Herman Melville book this is based on, Bartleby the Scrivener, I can't compare this adaptation to the original story, or comment on how it does or doesn't stick to the original themes. What I can say is that this is a very interesting movie with many standout performances. If you like quirky offbeat independent films, this is definitely a movie for you.

The DVD has interviews with all the cast members in character, which is pretty cool, but the interview with Crispin Glover discussing the concepts of the film is definitely the best. He offers a little bit of insight into the general theme of the film and the meaning behind ""I'd prefer not to"".",1167868800,2,1187,4.697115384615385
1879246,4,B0000950WB,"Melville's sometimes disturbing and creepy text gets a fine rendition, overall, in this 2000 Jonathan Parker adaptation. Crispin Glover is remarkable as Bartelby, and Glenne Headly is a fine boss.

Some of the other characterizations, however, don't work quite as well. Neither does the dialog that isn't from Melville. But don't let the unevenness of the movie put you off. It is the kind thing that folks who like this kind of thing would prefer. Or not.",1126224000,2,456,4.922077922077922
1879247,3,B0000950WB,"This is a decent film, I'm not that familiar with the original story but it's still good. The thing I liked most about it is that Bartleby's attitude is basically everybody's when it comes to work. Your boss tells or ask you to do something and most of the time if not all of the time you would prefer not too. Anyways, this is worth checking out, good acting and good story",1121385600,2,374,4.208333333333333
1879248,5,B0000950WB,"I'LL KEEP THIS REVIEW SHORT AND SIMPLE. Bartleby has become one of my most favorite indie films to date. It's so bizzare and different, it truely stands out from any movie I've ever seen. I used to work in an office like this and its painfully realistic in my opininon. Granted, the characters in this movie are exaggerated for entertainment purposes but I can totally recall past co-workers in this film. This movie is bound to become a cult classic. If you enjoy dark and oddball comedies, this movie has your name all over it.",1106784000,4,529,4.578947368421052
1879249,1,B0000950WB,"Prior to seeing this movie I believed that any movie based on a written work; Inherit the Wind, A Clockwork Orange, My Left Foot, A Raisen in the Sun... ect. had to be good.

No!

Based on a work by Herman Melville, this movie was the worst piece of excrement I have ever subjected myself to!",1102550400,3,292,4.196428571428571
1879250,4,B0000950WB,"Based on one of Herman Melville's less popular works `Bartleby the Scrivener' (heck, Moby Dick was somewhat ill received at the time it came out, probably due to allegorical nature), Bartleby (2001) is a wonderfully honest and true to its' source film providing a fairly seamless update of a story written over 150 years ago.

Co-written and directed by Jonathan Parker (his first film), Bartleby stars the ever enigmatic (and kinda creepy) Crispin Glover (River's Edge) along with David Paymer (Payback), Glenne Headly (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), Maury Chaykin (A Nero Wolf Mystery), Seymour Cassel (Tin Men), and Joe Piscopo...also appearing are Carrie Snodgrass (The Attic) and Dick Martin (Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In).

The film takes place in the present day, set in a modest public records office.  The boss (Paymer) has received news of more work coming their way, due to a lucrative government contract or such, and decides, in his prudent pragmatism, to hire on an extra person to help deal with the increased workload.  In a completely hilarious bit of un-realism, he composes a want ad, one would expect to see for a position involving risks, adventure, and great rewards, not one befitting the unassuming and ultimately duller than dull tasks involved with working in a public records office i.e. filing, fact checking, ect. (in the original story, they were scriveners, or, basically, human copy machines).  What makes it so hilarious is not only the wording of the ad, but the notion that Paymer's character thinks it's suitable...Vivian (Headly) opts not to post the ad, instead re-writing it to encompass, in her eyes, a very honest interpretation of said position, i.e. low pay, boring work, etc.  Despite (or, because of) the ad's bluntness, one applicant does appear, in a thin, pasty, soft-spoken man named Bartleby (Glover).  Upon seeing no one else is going to apply, Paymer's character hires Bartleby, and things seem to work out well, as Bartleby works very quickly and efficiently, but that soon changes as this once superior worker has now becomes non-working worker, picking and choosing what tasks he wishes to perform (fewer and fewer each day), with the standard reply of ""I'd prefer not to"" to those menial tasks he wishes to no longer perform.  This sets off a quiet struggle between Paymer's character and...the wall?  It might was well be, as Bartleby is as about forthcoming, offering no explanations of any kind for his non-working (oh, he still shows up everyday, he just doesn't do any work).  You'd think this would be cause to terminate the employment of said individual, and Paymer's character tries, but just isn't successful, almost as if he can't, like he's somehow bound to Bartleby in unseen fashion (perhaps a magic tether, one made up of a combination of feelings ranging from guilt to envy).

The best part of this contemporary retelling of Melville's classic tale is Paymer, a conformist struggling to understand and come to terms with this non-conformist entity that he has inadvertently allowed into his environment, which has now taken hold like a mold settling into a home.  His frustration grows rapidly, as Bartleby continually confounds his employer with his unrelenting, pacifistic stance of not working, refusing to perform even the simplest of tasks, and offering no reasoning or cause for his behavior.  Glover does very well as Bartleby, and given that he has so few lines, his character must come through in non-verbal means, and does, in a truly cryptic and puzzling manner.  The impression I got was that this character was posing a non-confrontational rebellion against the tedium inherent within the bureaucracy that forces people into the unnatural state of accepting automatons, extracting and crushing the very soul of these individuals by means of menial and tedious tasks for the sake of keeping the machine alive.  Another actor I though did well was Glenne Headly as Vivian, the office manager, and only woman, tempting her male counterparts with homemade candies and a flirtatious nature.  It struck me more that her character acted the way she did to validate her feministic qualities, to her co-workers, and herself, as the day to day humdrum works to obfuscate such qualities, as they only serve to disrupt and distract from the nature of the work.  Chaykin was good, as the sort of office nut and hypochondriac, unwilling to participate in niceties often associated with people who maintain a day-to-day business relationship, and little else.  Piscopo did better than I thought, as the smarmy, sleazy office Lothario (his amorous activities remain mostly outside of business hours), but I couldn't help wonder if he was just playing the role as directed, or if he understood his position within the context the story, and the story itself.  The bits of humor interspersed throughout the film, those not inherent to the original story, helped to make this easier to take for those not familiar with Melville's absurd tale, but I think those who are familiar with the source material will not be disappointed.  Some things have changed (which character was Vivian supposed to represent?  Nipper?  Ginger Nut?), mostly superficial, but the core elements are here, and come through very well.  I thought the direction was done well and helped present the story as well as anyone could to the silver screen.  The sets were minimal (love that 2nd office), providing a suitable backdrop.  Basing the entire score around Theremin music was an interesting choice, and one that seemed entirely appropriate, but it still got on my nerves after awhile.

The non-anamorphic wide screen print provided on this DVD looked pretty good, from what I could tell.  I've heard others have had problems with after images trailing the actors, but I saw none.  The sound is quite good, and there are two options; Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo.  As far as special features, there are more than I would have thought including a trailer, filmographies, interviews, a featurette titles About the Theremin, and a mini-director commentary.

7989481,4,B0000950WB,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

I remember watching a British film version of this for one of my high school English classes and being intrigued enough with the story (wondering what made him the way he was), over a decade later I immediately sought out this film version when I learned it existed (still need to read the story).  Related to Bartleby a lot.  And just like him, when my workplace became too much to take, I had the good sense to leave while I still could.  Sure, I could have kept trying (and failing) to conform, but ""I preferred not to"".  Maybe its just me, but I find it quite hypocritical and ironic of our society that we say we praise rebels and ""badasses"" who follow their own rules, but when we come across a true original like Bartleby, maybe someone more introverted who's rebellion is more ""silent"", we ostracize them rather than try to understand.  Something wrong with that in my opinion.

Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494547200,,1970,4.591428571428572
