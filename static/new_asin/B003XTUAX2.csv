4218846,4,B003XTUAX2,"I enjoyed this movie.

I liked the fact that the Princess (Amy Acker - Angel) was strong, caring, and big suprise, not dressed in the usual slutty SyFy outfits.  Her Father the King is played by the always great Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy).  And as a Divinci-type character John Rhy-Davies (Sliders) is fun as always.  I don't remember the name of the actor who plays the dragon fighter - but he is a hottie and actually adds to the movie (as does the leader of the Guards from the other town - yowza!)

I'm not going to try and retell the entire story here, but it was great to see strong men AND women characters that had chemistry and were compelling individuals (good or bad).  The dragons were fun/ok, and the story line actually continued to the end of the movie (which if you are a fan of Sci-Fi movies you know this can be a problem).  The Princess stayed strong and didn't become a Disney ""I need to be saved by the Prince"" two diamensional wimpy washout (I don't mean you Mulan!!).

Bottom line is that the acting is pretty good, the scenery is beautiful, and the story is strong.  Are we talking Oscar here? OF COURSE NOT. But it is fun - and don't forget it has Dragons! How bad could it be?",1349740800,,1201,4.302222222222222

4218850,4,B003XTUAX2,"Fire and Ice is a well done Dragon based fairy tale.  The dragons, all CGI, are unique from other movies and add well to the low budget adventure.  The cast is pretty good particularly Amy Acker (Angel seasons 3-5) as a rough and tumble princess.  The scrip falls a bit short when developing her bravery, as the dragon attacks the village, and when only armed with a dagger, she gets beat down pretty easily.  The movie is rated PG-13 which is probably right although I don't think too many of today's pre-teens would have issues with people being incinerated by dragon's breath, or stabbed through the heart with little to no blood.",1292284800,2,633,4.625

4218852,2,B003XTUAX2,"I honestly feel sorry for Pitof. The guy started off with such stylistic promise, but then he directed ""Catwoman"" and it was all downhill from there. And his latest fantasy foray is ""Fire And Ice: The Dragon Chronicles,"" a movie that is quite good by the standards of SyFy/Sci-Fi original movies (Alert: now damning with faint praise!), but is still a massive stewpot of bad fantasy cliches.

Carpia is a happy, clean, Renaissance Faire kind of kingdom... until a giant dragon starts periodically visiting to burn everything. With the population starving (although everybody still looks pretty plump), Princess Louisa (Amy Ackers) sets out to find a legendary banished knight who is apparently the ONLY PERSON who can slay a dragon. Sadly, the guy has died and she has to deal with his money-grubbing son Gabriel (Tom Wisdom).

So how do you kill a fire dragon? Uh... apparently you sic an ice dragon on it, although it seems Gabriel's dad didn't do that. And of course, while they're fighting the good king of Carpia will clash at last with the evil king of a neighboring kingdom. Symbolism!

Let's see, we have a Han-Soloish hero, slimy advisor, wise and quirky mentor, spunky tomboy princess, perfect king, evil king, and sinister forest inhabited by malevolent savages? It feels like Pitof mined every single cliche he could come up with for ""Fire and Ice,"" and just added water for INSTANT EPIC FANTASY MOVIE.

Even worse, the script has painful dialogue (""I'm expecting a hollow echo when I pierce your heart""), plot holes (these kingdoms are TINY), and some really bizarre moments (behold the Medieval Movie Projector!). And while Pitof does his best to cover the seams, it's pretty obvious this was a low-budget affair -- I mean, the forest people are wannabe ninjas wearing leaves and making whooping noises!

And the acting is generally pretty horrible. Most of the competent actors like Arnold Vosloo and Tom Wisdom give stiff flat performances; it seems like they're just waiting to get paid. As for poor Amy Ackers, she is handicapped by the fact that Princess Louisa is a blithering moron -- I mean, she hides from a dragon UNDER A WOODEN WAGON, then toddles away with a preteen on her back! AND she tells total strangers in a forest, ""I'm the princess!"" Apparently all that royal inbreeding has had an effect.

In fact, John Rhys-Davies is the only enjoyable performance, since he has all the best lines (""Money? We like money! I remember what it looks like!""). I just wish he were starring in something better.

So what is good about this movie? The exteriors are very nice (especially the castle), and the scenery is simply lovely . And the dragons are quite unique -- giant reptilian creatures with manta-ray wings that trail ice or fire wherever they fly, and have an egg between their eyes. Kinda cool, actually.

It's good for a SciFi/SyFy movie, but that's honestly not saying much. ""Fire And Ice: The Dragon Chronicles"" is a big soggy mass of cliches, in a simple plot that doesn't really do much.",1282089600,21,3020,4.827852998065764
4218853,1,B003XTUAX2,"Fire & Ice (Pitof, 2008)

First, the good: Fire & Ice has, quite simply, the coolest damn dragons I have ever, bar none, seen in a fantasy movie.

Now, the bad: everything else. Pitof started out his career with the entertaining, if shallow, Chronicles of Vidocq, and has since been traversing a slippery downward slope that has landed him at this most mediocre of levels: directing Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies. How is it that you can come up with a cast of this caliber and still make a movie this awful?

Plot: a fire dragon has been ravaging a kingdom. In order to get rid of it, Gabriel (300's Tom Wisdom), the son of the last dragonslayer, along with his faithful assistant Sangmiel (John Rhys-Davies) and naive-but-spunky princess Luisa (Alias' Amy Acker), has to travel to the next kingdom over, swipe a dragon egg, and use it to awaken an ice dragon...and then hope the two of them will kill one another.

Now, those who have watched the movie (I'm not sure I've encountered anyone I'd call a ""fan"") seem to be divided on the dragons. This is because they don't look like one expects a dragon to look. (But then, neither do Eastern dragons...) They look more like giant manta rays that were in some way crossed with comets so that their particular element floats around them and trails them like a cloud. Okay, so it's not traditional. That doesn't mean it's not really, really cool. It's actually an original take on something, which is something this movie otherwise sadly lacks. It also lacks a workable script, any decent editing, competent cinematography, a decent soundtrack, and, most surprisingly, good acting. This is quite the cast here. (I didn't mention The Mummy's Arnold Vosloo or Children of Men's Oana Pellea, either.) Once again I find myself with evidence that a bad director can mess up a movie that otherwise seems like a surefire success. Watch the first few minutes to see the fire dragon, skip an hour, check out the big battle between the dragons, and ignore the rest. *",1277337600,10,2005,4.72
4218854,4,B003XTUAX2,"TOXIC SPELLING ALERT!!! GET OVER IT!!!!

 This will be a comentary on my recent viewing of this film on the ScFy Channel. So, if there is any additional footage or subplots, they have not been seen yet by me.
  The plot synopsis says it all. This fairy tale derives what little originality it has from the design/look of the dragons themselves. The human charectors are mix and match steriotypes lifted out of any gamer's mannual. The cast is uninspired and only the two young leads radiate any energy to speak of.
  The dragons are very Manta Ray/like and look too thick to fly. But dragons are magical creatures, so forget airodynamics. The movie is not an adult scaled fantacy on any level. The lack of funds shows in every aspect of the look and feel of it. Even the dialog is peppered with sloppy, modern phrases. So one has to work a little harder to suspend disbelief. But the camera work is tight and the pace is good. The dragon action is well spaced and believable, So the grand battle at the end is good and worth the wait.
  I personaly like fantasy and monster movies. With the advent of CGI dragon movies are quickly becomming a sub-genre all their own. This is a family friendly movie in tone and graphic style. I would have no problems with showing it to my grand kids,if I had any.
  Within its own reality,this Fire And Ice shows us another look into impossible worlds and never never lands. For only that it is worth a good look.

The kingdom's princess (Amy Aker), takes the initiative and finds a Dragon Slayer (Tom Wisdom) and his mentor (John Rhys Davies) to help the kingdom.  They waken an Ice Dragon in the process. The dragon effects were well done. The sets and locations were well done.  The story idea was an interesting one with a bit of a different spin on dragons. Fire & Ice might have been excellent with its Dragons, Decieved King, Damsel and Dragon Slayers all well cast. All of the actors are excellent, usually.  I was very impressed with Tom Wisdom (300) in his recent work on 'Dominion' and  Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy) usually turns in a strong performance and John Rhys Davies (LOTR, Raiders) is always great and Amy Acker  did good work on 'Angel' and other TV shows, but they seemed not to have brought their ""A"" game to this film.  It didn't help their work that the story was not well served by the weak script.  It's pleasant enough if you'd like a mindless Sci fi/fantasy turn, but it isn't anyone's best work.

Amy Acker is cast as Princess Luisa. She recruits the son of a legendary knight to do battle with this mighty beast. Amy does battle with tree people. She uses some of her fighting skills she learned as Fred Burkle in the Angel series.  The weapons collection pales in comparison to the vast weaponry Angel had at his disposal.

4218869,4,B003XTUAX2,"A nice little film about kings and princesses and knights who come and save the kingdom from dragons. Shot on a budget in Romania, don't expect  perfection, but it does deliver a fair story and has some name actors. But it does seem that some of the Romanian actors had their voices replaced - either that or they just had no idea how to do the re-record. Have a look at the queen for one - her voice is almost never in synch with the video while there is no issue with other actors in the same scenes. The CGI dragons are nothing special. Looking at the disk credentials, the Blu-ray video presentation is generally OK with rich colours and generally good definition and the DTS-HD MA audio does the trick with clear voices and bass that's not boomy.",1452038400,,751,4.402877697841727

4218885,4,B003XTUAX2,"I am partial to dragons, that's what drew me to this movie (two dragons for the price of one).  How can you hate a movie with hot and cold running dragons?  True, it's not the best example of a fantasy flick featuring dragons.  The heroine (Amy Acker as Princess Luisa) is a tad on the sappy side of annoying.  Her eventual love interest (Tom Wisdom as Gabriel) is a standard hero type that everyone must rely on.  Her father the `good' king is played by Arnold Vosloo, half the time he looks bewildered, as though he was asking why am I in this movie, as opposed to, ""what's my next line?""  Of the lot, only John Rhys-Davies looks as though he's having any fun (""Money!  Oh, we like money!  I remember what it looks like!"").  The rest of the cast are unknown foreign actors learned in the realm of melodrama (the way in which they over-emote you'd think they thought they were doing Shakespeare!).  At any rate, the plot is simple and straight forward.  The kingdom of Carpia is besieged by a dragon that's on fire as it spouts fire.  Their neighbors are not in the least bit worried by this evil creature because they have a big round doodad on their roof that keeps this dragon at bay.  There's plenty of skullduggery and betrayal.  The good queen scowl's a lot and the good king listens to his (so obviously EVIL) advisor entirely too much, you'd think he didn't have a brain of his own worth making decisions without the input of this slimy sycophant.  Naturally, they need a dragon slayer but end up with another dragon instead.  I guess no one bothered to consider that using one dragon to kill another dragon still leaves you with a dragon to deal with.  The ice dragon certainly couldn't be called upon to commit suicide after playing mercenary for them.  Time to pay the piper!

Yes, it's a bit on the dopey side but I enjoyed it nonetheless.",1426204800,8,1852,4.458333333333333
