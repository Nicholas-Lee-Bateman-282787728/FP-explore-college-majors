3534897,5,B001DN0UPI,"I really enjoyed watching this anime. Usually I can not watch animes like this though because of how rediculous they are. EX: Love Hina that main character is so ignorant and dorky. There is usually a lot of poor comedy as well. This series is different, sure the main character is a dork, but not too much to where I was turned off.

The story starts out like this. Yamato(the main character) goes to tokyo to attend high school and sees this beautiful girl(Suzuka other main character) on a track field while walking to his new apartment. He instantly falls in love with her. On his way home he trys to figure out ways to introduce himself to her and when he makes it to his new home he finds out she lives next door to him. He goes through many challenges to win over Suzuka's heart, but she is just so stubborn. Then Yamato finally finds out what is the matter with Suzuka.

It is a wonderful story that any one that has been to high school and has liked someone can relate to. This series reminded me of how you are so close to the things you want to have, but yet you can not reach them. If you like drama/comedy series then you will enjoy this one. It only cost me about $15 so it was not much, but it was worth every penny. This is a series that ages 10 and up can watch. There are no dirty scenes in this series and it has mild language.

3534898,5,B001DN0UPI,suzuka is just one of those animes that sucks you in right from the begining. the story line is very interesting and it keeps you wanting more. so if u ever want so see how relationships get down i suggest u buy.,1262908800,,212,4.071428571428571
3534899,5,B001DN0UPI,"If your anything like me then high school might stand out in your mind as those four awkward years when you realized you liked someone. Like ""LIKE"" liked someone. Unless your life was perfect at least one of these realizations probably led to heartbreak of one kind or another. This is where a majority of Suzuka's appeal was for me.

For the price you can get the entire series for (I believe I purchased it for just over twenty dollars), I would mark it as an excellent buy. Twenty six episodes are contained on four disks which have art(probably from the manga) on them and look quite pretty. The case is plastic and holds four dvds (two overlapping on each side of the inside of the box). Now onto the actual show!

Okay, so maybe that was a little vague. Truthfully this show contains elements of comedy as well as romance, but throughout the series the two are distinctly separated. This is to say, while those looking for a comedy fix might enjoy Suzuka thoroughly for all its awkward approaches by the main character, I found that the heart of the series lay well... in it's heart.

The main reason I found myself following this series was its tendency towards realism. Something not usually found in anime concerning love at first sight. Akitsuki Yamato is an incoming freshmen in high school in Tokyo who, while walking by the track one day, falls for a high jumper named Asahina Suzuka. Unlike many shows where the female lead visibly shows affection from the get go this series is paced so that you honestly can't tell whether all of Akitsuki's efforts to win the girl's heart will pay off until the very last episode. The characters develop at a steady pace and it never feels like the story is being rushed because of it.

While the music and backgrounds of Suzuka weren't awe-inspiring, they weren't bad either. Honestly I was more interested in the character's dialogue than the incidental music which would pop up whenever there was a chance for it to. The music was what you might expect from a romance series; long strings and heartfelt pianos with the commonplace wacky music for frantic scenes. This doesn't mean its bad, it just means that aside from the opening theme, you probably won't grow to remember.

Perhaps these things weren't that much of a downside considering that this series is primarily focused on the relationships (yes there are more than one!) of Akitsuki. I wouldn't really say this is a sports anime because even though the races are heart-pumping and necessary to the plot they only serve as a place for Akitsuki to dwell on his current girl troubles. Having watched this show through to it's 26th episode end, I must say that it left me wanting more. I wanted to further follow the characters I'd become emotionally invested in and see more, but I agree with the decision to end it where it did. It is really rare to find a show with such genuine emotion in it, and while it's not going to work as an alternative to a show like Love Hina which is more comedic, I think that it proves to be a much more memorable experience than its price leads you to believe.
Overall i give it a 4.5 (marred only by the music and lack of many extra features) to show just how under-rated and under-talked about this series is. If it can get a cynical 20 year-old bastard like me to tear up then it receives my highest recommendation.",1250553600,56,3362,4.5688225538971805
3534900,5,B001DN0UPI,"Suzuka is probably one of the more original animes I've seen of late because unlike most other series that take place in outer space or in earth-like locations where the laws of physics are just a bit more interesting than on good old planet earth Suzuka takes place in present day Japan.  There are no super powers, no cute fuzzy creatures, no robots, and no cute alien women with jiggly body parts.  What's left is a very realistic romantic comedy that actually deals with issue that real folks are likely to encounter.  Odd that this would actually make an anime unique, but in what is essentially a comic book driven genre in this case - it does.

That said, Suzuka does a masterful job of actually developing its characters and slowly revealing all the complex issues and underlying emotions that drive them.  At times it's awkward and uncomfortable, but then again so was high school.  So all in all, a great series for folks looking for a story about people and the only regret I have is that I suspect there won't be a follow up to this series.",1247011200,5,1052,4.5396825396825395
3534901,5,B001DN0UPI,"I just finished watching this yesterday.
I found this anime to be very good and is now, one of my favorites.
This anime is all about character development.  Over the course of the series you really get to know and understand Yamato and Suzuka, and the reasons why their relationship is the way it is. The story line is also good and rather believable, and contains a real amount of drama, rather than the overly dramatized plots that are so common in entertainment today.  This series is also one of the best acted that I have ever seen.  During some episodes you will feel so sympathetic for the characters that you'll need to remind yourself that its just a TV show.
The best part about this anime is that everyone can relate to it in some way.  I highly recommend Suzuka to everyone.",1237420800,2,786,4.475524475524476
3534902,5,B001DN0UPI,"This was quite possibly the most amazing and complex romance I've ever seen in anime. The series is completely character-driven (with only the slightest indications of a deus ex machinae to help set up certain situations). The characters all have their own personality flaws, and you really have to pay attention to the dialogue for the subtext that helps you understand these people. Once on that level you can see the chess game being played here to overcome emotional obstacles despite personal flaws. Every moment in this show was very rewarding, and I couldn't stop watching until I got to the end!

This series is not for children, though. There's no real nudity or bad language--it's just not many children would appreciate what's going on here.

Holy cow! I'm in love with Suzuka! This is a great story!",1236211200,35,811,4.869565217391305
3534903,5,B001DN0UPI,"Honestly i had no idea of what I was getting into when I saw the first couple of episodes on T.V. on On-Demand.  After those episodes i was completely hooked to this anime.  I waited for awhile until newer episodes came onto t.v. but they were taking to long so I just came to Amazon, and purchased the box set.  I give it five stars in that it is by far one of the best anime I have ever watched.  it tend to get very emtional at times because of the storyline, but that makes it ever better, and has you reeling for more.  It even has humor in it that keeps it very lively.  I recommend anyone getting this anime, because it is truely good, and it's story can relate to you on a personal level if you are willing to go that extra length to be with that special girl.  I would like to point out that it is a shame though that the anime ends after the 26th episode, but the mange still continues.  I really feel funimation should have continued it, but who knows maybe they will.  But all in all it is worth the buy!",1235347200,5,1016,4.04

3534933,2,B001DN0UPI,"Based on the description, I thought that it would be a good buy, but when I viewed it, I found that I did not like the series as I thought I would.
I found both protagonists to be very unlikeable --  to me, Suzuka's attitude towards Yamato up to the last five minutes of the series seemed too repulsive to be of any redemptive value.  Yamato did not garner any sympathy from me either -- why any boy would go ga-ga over a girl who treats him like Suzuka does while a cute girl that really likes him (and for far longer) and would not ever think to do him that way is beyond me.  I actually found myself grieving for that girl while being happy for her at the same time that she will not be saddled with that bum.  Overall, I found the end result, i.e., Suzuka and Yamato together at the end, to be forced.
Unless one likes to see that sort of stuff, I would say, ""Skip this one.""",1422316800,,879,4.063583815028902

3534962,4,B001DN0UPI,"I bought this series on a whim during a sale on Rightstuf, I remember having seen the Manga in stores when it came out but never had the opportunity to buy it.

I sure was missing out.

The story sure starts out very rote and cliche. But very quickly I was surprised at the depth of the writing, and the characters.

And it continues on that path for the whole series.

I do feel that the show felt like there was more to be said by the time it was. There was a lot of stuff left that could happen I think.

But generally, just by the title this is one of those that you know how the show will end. It's obvious from the beginning. But this is one of those things where the show isn't just about the outcome. It's about the Journey.

And the journey is quite great.

At times it can be predictable,but the characters are all likable and well developed by the time it's over.

For me, this show is unforgettable.

3534963,3,B001DN0UPI,Story deals with the trials of youth and relationships.  Loved the ending but felt a little sad for one of the characters. Kind of took me back to my days in high school.,1393372800,,170,4.151515151515151
3534964,5,B001DN0UPI,"Okay, so I gave this series five stars on the Amazon Rating Scale. I did this for 2 reasons. First, The box set itself is fairly nice, has good box art, and even some commentaries (which is awesome). My second reason is that I would recommend this anime to people who haven't seen it (especially since it's so cheap). The anime itself however, requires a more in depth review than just a five star rating.

Story: The story in this anime is more or less based upon a love triangle scenario. Yamato Akitsuki is just starting high school in Tokyo, when he falls in love with Suzuka. Suzuka is a track star, as well as Yamato's next door neighbor. Meanwhile, a young girl named Honoka Sakurai has been in love with Yamato since she was very young, and now she wants to make her move. The story is well paced, and is purely character driven. The complex emotions of the characters were well portrayed, as was the subtle character development that occurred as the series progressed. Suzuka herself pissed me off sometimes, but other than that everything was expertly done.

Dub: The dub for this anime was fantastic. Funimation is my favorite dubbing company for a reason. Todd Habercorn and Leah Clark were great as Yamato and Suzuka respectively, and Brina Palencia (who is one of my favorite voice actresses) was perfect as Honoka. The side characters were also great. No complaints at all with the dub (except maybe the dubbing of the opening and ending songs, but that doesn't really matter).

Animation: The animation is one area where Suzuka was fairly weak. To be fair, this anime was from 2005, so you can't expect something too eye catching. Also, since this is primarily a romance, the animation doesn't need to be amazing. That being said, I felt it could have been done better at multiple points. I will say that some of the backgrounds look great, but other than that, the animation was completely average. Either way, this doesn't make or break the show.

Music: The music was pretty good. I will say that the op and ed songs were bad, and I didn't like the music played during the comedy scenes. However, this is balanced out by the fantastic music during the drama scenes. It tends to be very soft music, and it is perfect for the show. In particular, I have to mention the piano tack Tooi Hi no Kizuato for being not only the best track in Suzuka's OST, but for being one of the highlights of the anime.

Overall: I really enjoyed Suzuka, and I think it's certainly worth picking up for any hardcore anime fan. I would give Suzuka an 8.5 out of 10.",1390003200,,2561,4.558695652173913

3535003,3,B001DN0UPI,"I first bought this anime probably 4 or 5 (or maybe more) years ago now. I only watched it once. I decided to rewatch it recently, since it had been such a long time and I didn't remember much of anything about this show besides the fact that it left a bad taste in my mouth. But it had been so long that I really just wanted to rewatch it. And being older the second time around helped me to understand the show better as well, which is probably why I didn't give this 1 star. The first few episodes offer a good introduction to the characters and their relationships to one another. After that, it starts to get...painful.

Yamato confesses his feelings to Suzuka, who rejects him because of reasons explained around a third of the way in and expounded upon slightly near the end, though she does like him. This results in her acting in contradictory ways throughout pretty much the entire show, sending mixed signals to Yamato (who is one of my main problems with this show), even though it's painfully obvious when it shows her face that her words don't match her feelings. While it's understandable, given what is learned about her, it gets really old after a while.

Yamato, meanwhile, manages to make the show almost intolerable at times. For almost the entire show, he's incredibly self-centered and blind to others' feelings. In addition, for a large part of the show it felt like he was like a lost puppy when he didn't get Suzuka's approval. He's incredibly desperate, which is incredibly unappealing to watch. He has certain expectations in his head for how their interactions should go, and gets upset when they don't happen like he envisions, completely ignoring the fact that Suzuka has no knowledge of these expectations, nor any obligation to meet them. A couple times later on, it gets to the point where he becomes very angry with Suzuka. While I understand his frustration, I don't really feel too sorry for him considering that he knows why Suzuka has such mixed feelings about him by that point. You could say that it's okay because they're teenagers, and teenagers are more self-centered and angsty. However, there are other teenagers in the show who have very keen perception of others' feelings and relationships, and who are decidedly not angsty (namely Yasunobu, Miki, and Nana).

My other big complaint with this show is that it milks romantic tension and insecurity for it's own sake, to the point where it eventually becomes devoid of any real meaning. At more than a few points, I noticed myself groaning because it felt so forced. I also said things in a very blunt, matter-of-fact voice to the effect of ""I GET IT, X CHARACTER HAS X TRAIT. YOU'VE ALREADY SHOWN THIS CLEARLY"" more than a few times to my television. The problem isn't that the show played with my heart strings. It's that it did so in a very contrived manner, with only one or two notable exceptions. I applaud shows that do it well. This is not one of those shows.

Despite all of that, I kept watching. And the last third of the show is really when I enjoyed it most. Yamato was starting to have a brain and Suzuka was starting to be more honest with herself about her feelings, even if she wasn't being honest with any of the other characters yet (that really doesn't happen until the very end). It felt like they were finally starting to come into their own. It was incredibly refreshing, and left me feeling really good after the show was over. I wonder if that's because the middle was so painful and frustrating to watch at times....

I'd give this anime 2.6 or 2.7 stars, but since Amazon only uses whole numbers, I'm rounding up to 3 stars, giving this show the benefit of the doubt. All in all, I think the good parts are more than good enough to outweigh all the frustration I experienced at certain points in this anime. And considering how frustrating it was at times, that's saying a lot. Overall, I enjoyed watching this show. But...Yamato...just...argh....",1358380800,2,3970,4.6415362731152205
3535004,5,B001DN0UPI,I loved this series. It made me laugh and cry. The pacing is fast but that's not a bad thing. The story doesn't stall and stay in one place for too long but doesn't rush itself.

3535015,4,B001DN0UPI,"I watched this on a whim on Hulu a while back, thinking it was going to be an anime about school and sports. Sure, it has those things, but there is a lot more. It tells the story of a boy caught up with the fantasy of being with the one girl in school everyone dreams of being with, but never says it out loud. The story comes together a little slow, but you eventually get into it and even begin to cheer for the main character as he strives not only to win over Suzuka, but also accomplish his own track and field goals. There are a few rather funny moments in the series so it doesn't become overly serious except when it needs to be. When it all ends, you expect it, but it's still just as satisfying. I found myself wishing the story would go on.",1353888000,,752,4.053691275167785

This is one of the best romance animes I've seen. It's a very touching and emotionally heavy story. There are lots of great characters and plot twists.

There's a difference in being a tsundere and being a bitch. Suzuka is just an UNLIKEABLE triple bitch like Kei from ef and Mayo from Fushigi Yuugi Eikoden. Stay away from this series. Every character except Miki Hashiba are annoying",1348358400,2,269,4.869565217391305
3535018,3,B001DN0UPI,I was actually going to give this a one star.....I was midway through the last episode and was just about to call it quits on the series but decided to see it through....the ending made up for all the anger I was feeling up to that point....the storyline kinda goes in a circle but it does come to an acceptable conclusion,1347148800,,322,4.295081967213115
3535019,3,B001DN0UPI,"I must say. Suzuka is one mean and uppity gal. I found it really difficult to sympathize with the main character's infatuation with her. I understand that sometimes one cannot help but love another person, despite circumstance. But she is genuinely mean to him. We see later that there was something in her past that helped to spark this kind of attitude, and then when the viewer is ready to forgive her, she gets even worse! So I had a hard time stomaching this show because I just couldn't stand her.

But being a fan of track and field, I did enjoy the periphery story. I did also like most of the characters in the series as well. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting (in the Japanese) is solid. The music confused me because I kept thinking it was from another series and they were re-using it. Maybe it was just similar to something else like Clannad.

But when Akitsuki says anything nice, Suzuka basically turns on him and lashes out in mean ways. Such as when his family puts her up for the night, and he offers to show her around, she gripes at him and tells him to leave her alone. Later she asks to stay another night so she can see the fireflies. Of course, this was not a nice gesture, but a way of breaking apart two other happy people. Jeez. But she gets so upset and standoffish when he becomes interested in someone else after overhearing her say she dislikes him. I mean, can you blame the poor guy?

All in all a decent show, but I really cringe at how rotten Suzuka is to Akitsuki and how often he just seems to take it or how he continues to try and befriend her. I kept waiting for someone to slap her. But I finished the series because I was invested in watching already, and the track scenes were nice.  Though in the end, the actual story arc involving Akitsuki was left unfinished.

I understand Suzuka's reasons for being the way she is, as it is revealed in her back story.  But it's really tough to watch at times.  So don't hate me for the 'okay' review.  I know that love is blind and all, and the viewer is really behind Akitsuki and rooting for him because of his stubborn good nature.  I give the first half of the show 2 stars and the second half 4 stars.  It does improve about halfway through, right about the time where Akitsuki offers that special someone a birthday present.  From then on the series improves drastically.

Overall I wouldn't have missed anything by not watching this. If you like track an field, then it's a good watch. But for teen romance, look at other series: Clannad (one of the best ever), Haruhi Suzuyama, High School Rumble, etc...",1337731200,,2611,4.383022774327122

The story is based around Yamato Akitsuki, a young man from rural Hiroshima Prefecture moving to the big city of Tokyo, and his new next-door neighbor, Suzuka Asahina, a skilled high jumper. Yamoto falls in love with Suzuka and pursuing a relationship with her he joins the track and field team hoping to impress her. After joining, Yamoto discovers that he has the potential to become a top hundred-meter sprinter. The Manga is top notch and well told, while anime fails to capture what made the manga so great.

3535024,5,B001DN0UPI,"This anime is for people who enjoy teenage romances. The animation quality, voice acting, and art style are all no more than average. What this anime does have is a great storyline and soundtrack. It is realistic in that there are no science fiction elements or over the top situations.

Extra Info On This Particular Package- This anime collection includes all 26 episodes of Suzuka for a total runtime of 610 minutes. There are options for English and Japanese voice acting, but I believe there are only English subtitles (I cannot remember if there are Japanese Subtitles or not). There are two commentaries in which some of the cast simply talk during episodes 6 and 19. There are a few previews of other animes that run before the main menu opens.

3535035,3,B001DN0UPI,"""SUZUKA"" is your regular high school romance that doesn't attempt to break any grounds in the crowded market of high school romance animes out there making it hard to recommend ""SUZUKA"" over others.

First off, before I even get into the bulk of my review I would like to mention that ""SUZUKA"" is an anime adapation of a manga and doesn't cover the entire manga series. So viewers looking for the true conclusive ending won't find it here, even so the anime will still provide you with some closure to the series.

The story is about high school boy name Yamato Akitsuki who falls in love with the popular track star, Suzuka, and like most high school romance anime out there events doesn't play out as well Yamato wants. Throughout the story viewers will see Yamato emotionally confuse as what he should do. This is an acceptable trait for drama, but when a character spends the majority of the 26 episodes second guessing himself it quickly gets old. The anime also doesn't do the best job of portraying Yamato emotional conflicts, I feel as that the anime tells the audience what the character are feeling (many characters will often just think out loud how they are feeling), instead of showing it through animation. Although it is hard to fully discredit Yamato as he does exhibit a strong sense of self-improvement.

Our heroine of the story isn't that unique as well, she's what most anime viewers have seen before. She's just a girl with talented in track and field that has little to no clue on how she actually feels toward a person. To make matters worse this cluelessness often gets expressed as a cold shoulder towards Yamato, many times unintentionally. The strangest thing about her is that sometimes she seems a bit out of character. At times she can read Yamato like a book and at other times she seems to have no idea how really he is.

The ""SUZUKA""is a decent anime there's some jokes that will crack a smile and a couple of dramatic scenes that can gets your heart beating, but it's everything anime viewers has seen before in the more popular ones like ""Love Hina"" or ""Kanon"". ""SUZUKA"" might please people looking for something more traditional romantic story, but anyone else might be turned off after the first disc.

Overall Suzuka keeps you on your toes. when you think one thing is going to happen and things are finally going to work, somehow something else gets thrown into the mix.

3535038,3,B001DN0UPI,"After watching most of this series on Youtube I came to the conclusion that this series is very similar to Love Hina, but without the physical humor.

The similarities are:

The protagonists live in a dormitory/apartment building.
The hero is a loser who is lacking in self confidence.
The heroine is dysfunctional and can't admit to herself that she loves the hero.  She is always putting him down and insulting him, yet feels intense jealousy when other females show any interest in him.
There is a lovable secondary female character who worships the hero but he barely knows she is alive (Honoka is cross between Shinobu and Mutsumi).  The hero attempts a half hearted relationship with her, but it falls flat as he remains infatuated with the dysfunctional heroine.
There is sleazeball friend whose advice to the hero is typically disastrous.
The hero and heroine share a common goal (Get into Tokyo U vs. succeed at track and field)

There are differences of course. Suzuka is more serious and delves deeply into teen/young adult angst, insecurity and unrequitted love much more than Love Hina (it is interesting how these teen issues are universal regardless of culture, people are people I guess). Sometimes the situations are all too familiar from one's teenage years past. If you ever had a crush on someone and were afraid to tell them out of fear of rejection this series might hit too close to home.

The characters are less exagerated and there is no physical humor (Suzuka Asahina doesn't beat up Yamato the way Naru is always pummeling Keitaro, with unrealistic blows that send him flying into the sky). And there are no unrealistic characters like Kaolla or Motoko. Another major difference is that while Keitaro is generally upbeat (at least when not confronted by his poor practice entrance exam scores) Yamato is usually not.

I agree with another reviewer that the bath house scene in episode one was gratuitous and pointless, and definitely felt like fan service, which is out of character for this series.

Would I recommend this series? I think it's worth watching once, but for me it lacks the repeatability that Love Hina has.  For the right price (as in low) I would buy it.",1285632000,8,2200,4.86096256684492
3535039,3,B001DN0UPI,"I remember buying the first DVD of this series at a DVD sale at a local video score.  I thought I give it a try.  Having not read the manga for Suzuka, my opinion might be a little short-sighted since I heard more rave reviews for the comic strips due its detailed development of the characters and plot.  Basically, I bought series this fresh with no background of the story.

Overall, its a mixed bag:  its plot is enjoyable overall yet you have to be patient for the story to unfold. The Suzuka series here suffers from some pacing issues and slow character development.  The story later does give a significant backdrop to Suzuka's personality so we begin to empathize with her more.  Yet the beginning starts off rough, with the two main characters not hitting it off and Asahina (Suzuka) seeming so cold that the foundation of their storyline starts awkward.  Also, the beginning throws a huge smokescreen with the whole bathhouse comedic sub-plot.  It made no sense and makes viewers confused if this is a lovestory or a fan-service ATM machine.  Also, Asahina, I felt, was a flat character who spews venom towards everyone and lacks any depth, even with her haunted past.  By the time her story is known, I felt it was too late to save her character, she just lacks depth and just runs her mouth.  Akitsuki, meanwhile, is portrayed as an annoying loser who just pesters everyone.  His internal gripes and love-moments with Suzuka make him seem obsessive rather a lovable/loser hero.  The whole point of these ""love-chase"" kind of series is to believe that the hero has qualities that will ultimately shine.  Akitsuki, throughout the anime, doesn't really have that.  He just yells and runs back to her over, and over again.  We are supposed to believe in him, but in the end we exasperate in desperation at his fallacies and bumpkiss exploits to try to win his crush.

The only major credit I give to the series are the supporting characters.  I believe they hold it together where the two main characters lack real substance.  Honoka is cute and loveable; you root for her and feel her pain during her roller-coaster feeling battle and towards the end SHE is the lynchpin who makes the story finish well.  Miki Hashiba is charming yet a good supporter of both Asahina and Akitsuki.  Hattori is as a fool (when it comes to his philosophy on girls) as wise in helping Akitsuki in his troubles.  The whole sub-plot of track and field develops well, which I believe in itself is a minor character:  the idea of how far you push yourself to reach your goal/love, the pain, the determination, the grit to finish well.  The perfection-drive to fix your wrongs in your technique.  It fits well and nicely, as Akitsuki realizes the joy of running changes his perspective on his love for Asahina.

Overall, would I recommend this one?  If you want a more serious plot line, I think this one will do you well.  If you are looking for something more light-hearted, Suzuka is not for you.  I thought this was not a bad anime; there were some really great moments of laughter and ""ahhhh,"" but the character development needs work, especially the two main characters.  If the producers fleshed a more refined Suzuka, a woman of ambition yet carries a very heavy burden, and Akitsuki, a boy in the making who has a charm and is honest, then I would have enjoyed it more.",1285372800,10,3363,4.649152542372882

8294221,5,B001DN0UPI,"This is a surprisingly good anime.  In its own way, however, the story is quite sad.  I would compare it to a completely serious B Gata H Kei, simply because the similarities in teenage struggles in romance feel much the same to me, although the story is completely different and infinitely more realistic.  It follows the everyday life of Yamato Akitsuki, who has just moved to Tokyo for high school, hoping to change things up in his life a bit.  He is living with his aunt at her apartment complex, and although it seems at first like this will be the main stage for most of the anime, it definitely is not, which is good because that would have ruined this actually excellent story.  Yamato falls in love with Suzuka at first sight, upon seeing her practicing her high jump after school.  He decides he will join the track team to be closer to her in an attempt to date her.  But, she still has feelings for an old flame.  That's all I can say without giving away too much.

The animation is beautiful, and very old in its style - hand-painted.  The extras include trailers for Ouran High School Host Club, if that gives you an idea of its age (2005 was its release year).  It is 26 episodes long, run-time of 610 minutes, English and Japanese dubs, along with subtitles.

I felt, upon finishing the show, like the ending was quite sad in its own way.  The sequel, Fuuka, is much the same.  I personally think this author is very bittersweet, and that is very unnerving to me.  I loved this anime, but I will be avoiding other works from this author.",1482624000,,1554,4.422535211267606
