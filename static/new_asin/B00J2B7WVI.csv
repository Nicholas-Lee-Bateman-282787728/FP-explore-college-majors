8647348,3,B00J2B7WVI,"The book was better than this material. I loved the book, which is why I bought this curriculum, but it wasn't nearly as good material wise.
I'd suggest reading the book, doing a group book study, instead.",1518480000,,205,4.5675675675675675

8647354,5,B00J2B7WVI,"My husband and I go through the Love and Respect video course periodically...whenever I notice I'm returning to some old behaviors...

The first time through, it all seemed like learning French, because we just don't intrinsically know this vitally important information. There was so much I was completely clueless about.

The second time through, I was much more familiar with the ""French"" and could actually better implement what I was learning. It completely changed the dynamic of our marriage. We now have a beautiful, happy and very contented marriage.

When my husband and I observe others, we notice and talk about the Pink and Blue observations we make.

As a society, it's so easy to follow the relational examples that Hollywood provides...what a devastating mistake that is.

I purchased the course, some time ago, and we just recently went through it for a third time, this time with my parents, who after a few sessions, decided to also purchase the course. It's already opening eyes and beginning to turn things around in their marriage.

I'm most grateful for the Love and Respect video course, and how much it has properly educated us about the differences between Pink and Blue, and how to better understand and interact with one another.

Thank you for that! ",1466035200,2,1279,4.971830985915493
