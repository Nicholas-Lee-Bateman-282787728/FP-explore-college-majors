The film really didn't look finished to me.... it needed more answers like how a guy is showing defending someone from the bigfoot's but yet we never see what happens to him after the person he is helping runs away! that and the fact that they had a whole bunch of pointless scenes that lead to nothing and introduced no new characters... and what was up with the sheriff and his deputy... they were in a few scenes in the beginning and were never shown again!

Plot: a group of five college kids go to a one of the friends' house whom hasn't been there in years after a unexplained accident! But after a few drinks and smokes they soon realize (when there out in the middle of the woods with a tent and some toilet paper) that there is something out there and it is picking off and killing the (now 4) college kids off one by one and they are keeping the woman for breeding!

Review: The whole movie had such a ""I've not been completed and been put onto DVD as fast as possible"" feel to it but maybe there was a reason why... maybe they needed more money to finish it... but anyway... the acting was decent and the gore/creature effects where nasty and sick yet fun and creative. I'll admit that some of the noises used for the gore scenes (such as when a Bigfoot eats someone guts) where a little bit too Low-budget sounding! I wish it had a bigger budget like the movie ""Creature (2011)"" but alas it has no spot in theaters or even DVD as a matter of fact... but just not for now because I bet this film has a lot more potential that it gives!

Acting: The acting was okay I mean Texas Battle acted like a thug and I wish he acted more like he did in ""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (2007)"" and also some of the characters where put in and were never used like the old couple from the trailer.. They were shown only once! And the deputies that were used like two or three times I bet they would've been good actors too if they were given the opportunity!

Gore: Disembowelments, mangled corpses, a really harsh slashed throat and some more! it had good special effects but it could've used more gore!

Bottom Line: A sickening, decent acted, and bloody yet un-fished, overdone, and a ""leave you upset"" ending that doesn't really work well for the movie kind of film that feels wrong yet right at the same time!

Suggested MPAA: Rated: ""R"" for monster violence, sexuality, and language

4572988,5,B0055CP9D6,"The new Boggy Creek is an extremely well done film.  The script is amazing.  You can't help but like its characters.  I was utterly impressed by its quality.  However, I must warn you, you must go into looking for a movie, not a gorefest to enjoy it.  Not that it doesn't have gore.  There are some wonderful kill scenes.  The best part of this film though is its dark and bleak, Dawn of the Dead (2004) ending.  Totally check it out and give it shot if you like Bigfoot Horror.",1317686400,8,478,4.233333333333333

So I'm probably not very impartial when in comes to writing about videos such as this one.  Does the film have plot problems, marginal acting, occassionally slow pacing and obvious budgetary constraints?  Yes.  But it also has a drop-dead gorgeous cast of guys and gals, and a pretty good Bigfoot-style monster.  For me, that makes it enough to recommend!",1316476800,9,489,4.902439024390244
4572990,1,B0055CP9D6,"There have been some bad horror movies with bigfoot in them.  Some were bad in a good way that somehow makes them worth watching. This film is not one of that kind.  It is the kind of bad that can sour a person on the whole subject.  The acting was bad and the plot was worse.  There is no way I can imagine someone reading the script for this film and thinking it should be made. Either they lost something due to budget or it was intended to rip-off people who would think it might be fun (in that good bad way) like the original Boggy Creek.  I'm thinkng it is more of a rip-off.  Rent it cheap if you think I might be wrong.  You'll regret the lost time and the cheap rental fee, but at least you will save a bit compared to owning it.  Better yet, avoid it.",1316390400,6,762,4.0

4573031,3,B0055CP9D6,"An OK Big Foot movie. Big Foot is a carnivorous beast living in the SE Texas swamps. Interesting premise that has Big Foot as a maneater. A good idea, however, this was poorly executed. There are a ton of plot holes that ruin the movie. Bodies start piling up and the local Sheriff does nothing. No swamp search with armed volunteers looking for the beast. Absolutely nothing.

Minor Spoiler Alert*************
One of the characters has an issue with her boyfriend and decides to leave the cabin in the middle of the night and drives a very short distance down the only road. There is a blockage consisting of a small tree laying across the road. Big Foot has set up a roadblock. Note that there is at least one other cabin (neighbor), so this road is used fairly regularly for people to get in and out of town for gas/food/whatever. The girl gets out and tries to move the small tree and sees Big Foot, but, is taken before she can get away. The truck is left in the middle of the only road (not far from the cabin of her friends and a neighbor's cabin next door).  The next morning nobody notices anything amiss. I guess Big Foot drove the truck away and hid it in the swamp????
Spoiler Alert Off*************

There are a number of other issues with the plot that ruin the movie, but, revealing them gives away too much. I really liked the idea behind the story, but, was really disappointed by the very poor execution which only succeeded in turning this into just another lame B grade attempt at a horror movie.  The ending is the same type of clich&eacute;d ending used by all low budget horror movies for the last 30 years. This would be about the same level of cheesiness as a Sy Fy movie. The movie was cheap in price and I was curious so I purchased it. The actors did a good job, but, they couldn't save the movie because of the low budget script.",1461369600,2,1858,4.392441860465116

BOOM! Bigfoot complete.
 They tried to add depth to characters by adding pointless backstories, which pretty much wasted the entire movie, other than the last fifteen minutes.

4573195,2,B0055CP9D6,"For an indie Bigfoot flick this film is fairly entertaining....but hardly exciting, much less terrifying. The cinematography is good and there is some excellent location work done in this movie (Caddo Lake area???). Also, contrary to some assessments (and compared to MANY independent no-budget efforts I've seen), I'd rate the acting by the main cast in this thing as pretty good (NOT so much some supporting spots such as the utterly ineffectual, totally incompetent County Sheriff and his doofus deputy...both of whom are nothing but irritating charicatures). The writing is, overall, fairly plausible (for this type of movie) and the writers KNOW the typical mentality of brainless teenagers and depict it pretty accurately. Most of the character interactions among the main group ring fairly true. The biggest problems with this flick involve pacing (it drags on WAAAAAY too long trying to set itself up) and the attempted...and ineffective...juggling of too many sub-plots. And NONE of the sub-plots really GO anywhere.  The Setting is ""Boggy Creek, Texas"" instead of Fouke, Arkansas; a gimmick used to ""sell"" viewer attention and help with box office draw.  Not effective. The movie just meanders around and then meanders around some MORE!  It then tries to cram some terror into the ""last reel"" (so to speak), but the viewer has gotten to impatient waiting for all the ""good stuff"" to...FINALLY...happen that you are basically rooting for the sasquatch monsters in the end!!!!  The thing is pretty much a downer and you SEE that coming! It is 180 degrees away from a GOOD squatch-on-the-loose movie like ""Creature From Black Lake"".  Thing is, with a bit of TIGHTENING UP in the editing room, one has the sense that this COULD have been good. Maybe some sequence re-shoots would help, too. As is, though, I'd have to say the film is...eehhhhh...""okay"", but it could have been better. Essentially, the story is that the squatch monsters are horny, towering testosterone terrors who delight in mauling and mangling male toss-asides while hot on the trail of ""meow"".

4573280,2,B0055CP9D6,"The Good:
- Practical effects on what looks like almost no budget.  The creatures, though pretty cheaply made, really don't look too bad over all.  The gore was okay, but not really bad considering, again, the budget.
- The lighting and setting worked really well in my opinion.  At no do I remember having trouble seeing what was happening, which is a common problem in low budget horror.
- They correctly used foreshadowing, though I honestly don't know if this was intentional or not.
The first two reasons are why I gave it two stars, because those were essentially the two things I was looking for.

The Bad
- Everything else
- Camera work.  For the most part it was basic and got the job done, but some times there was a hazyness/glow to the video that was distracting.
- Characters.  Inconsistent, boring, with tidbits of ""development"" thrown in to try and give them some kind of depth but all that did was distract from anything else going on and go absolutely nowhere.  They acted as intelligently or as stupidly (mostly this one) as they needed to in order to be where their kill scene was.
- Acting.  Eh, not good but I've definitely seen worse.
- Plot.  The main plot is just there to get them to the point where they will get slaughtered, nothing more.  Side plots popped up here and there and only served to waste time before they were completely and utterly forgotten.
- Audio.  I didn't have any problems hearing what was going on, but it was obvious they weren't using that good of equipment.
- Length.  This was far too long for what they had.  Nearly the entire movie went by and it felt like almost nothing happened, then the last twenty minutes or so it seemed as though they forced everything to happen.  If this had been half the length then it could have been far better.",1389225600,,1795,4.5

4573287,3,B0055CP9D6,"I have seen more than my fare share of bad movies and horror movies in particular, but I can honestly say that this movie is far from being the worst or baddest that I have ever viewed. The production values were much better than I expected (lighting, camera work/angles, scenic landscape cinematography, image quality and so on) and the direction and acting was decent with some exceptions. The story and the sasquatch body were the weakest links of this production, but the human body parts were of decent quality. The story really dwells on the the leads grief over the loss of her dad and her issues with her mom throughout the movie. I felt that to much time was put into her character development and not enough on sasquatch and this led to the story bogging down a bit. There is more than a few scenes of sasquatch attacks sprinkled thorughout the movie to try to even the pacing out, but the time wasted on the lead characters dad/mom issues counteracts the attacks scenes. The attacks were less violent than expected/hoped for and they weren't gore filled either. I had hoped that the attacks would have been more violent especially from the guys point of view. I like gore, but its not needed if the attacks are done right, so I'm not real disappointed for the lack of gore. The ending is not the typical for the horror genre and the way it was done left a little to be desired. This is by no means a stealer movie by a long shot, but even with its fare share of flaws it was not a waste of my time. There are so many far worse movies out there and they contain many...many more issues than this one for you to avoid. Watch it just for the nice scenic shots of the swamp they helped sell this ok movie on me. I come from the desert and seeing the lush and rich green foliage landscape with wildlife (birds) and all that water made those scenes seem like an oasis. I will give this one a 3 star rating because its is so much better than so many others out there and if the story was better I would have given it 4 stars which I almost never give out to horror flicks. I respect all reviewers views and I guess I'm in the minority for giving this one 3 stars.

4573327,1,B0055CP9D6,"As a horror buff and a fan of the Bigfoot movies..I found this underwhelming and detached from the original film (this film claims no affiliation with the prior BC films). Filmed in Uncertain, Tx it has a great location since that area is known for many sightings and folklore. Since most Bigfoot movies are campy at best this one falls both short of comedic and horror value.

Eduardo Sanchez (Blair Witch fame) has a new new Bigfoot movie titled EXIST which is backed by a major studio and for once the creatures suit will be done properly and played more for legit scares than comedic value. Until then stay far away from this release as possible..horrid at best..

4573360,2,B0055CP9D6,"Despite all the negative reviews, I really wanted to like this movie. I was much encouraged when the film began with the very cool clips and shots of the bigfoot through the opening credits. I thought that was fantastic, and I got excited about the film. But once we get through the initial set-up killing this thing dives to a slow, slow, SLOW crawl wherein I guess we're supposed to learn about our characters.

I didn't really learn anything and I didn't really like any of the characters. In fact, I hated the lead actress who I thought was horrible. The best friend was okay, at best, and the other couple were there to supply the beefcake and cheesecake, as both were very attractive but otherwise added nothing to the film. The only one of the main cast I really liked was the best friend's boyfriend. The rest ranged from dull to terrible... and most of them couldn't act. The local sheriff and his weak-stomached deputy are the best characters in the film... too bad we don't see them for more than a couple minutes. They are pretty much throw-aways. The brooding guy next door wasn't very good and needed to speak the hell up and stop mumbling (a HUGE problem with this movie -- most of the actors mumble and whisper their way through it so that you miss a BIG chunk of dialogue). And that's about it for the characters here, except for some flashbacks of the main girl's childhood with her doting father and miserable mother. So of the lot I found only three characters I liked -- the best friend's boyfriend and the sheriff and deputy, and not one of them had an awful lot to say or do.

And for the first hour nothing happens. I mean NOTHING happens. I think there is a glimpse or two of the monster, but otherwise all we get is a whole lot of REALLY dull scenes of our dull and unlikeable group mumbling and whispering and acting badly. There's a little t&a and sixpack abs I guess to tease and tantalize, but that wasn't nearly enough to pump life into this dull, plodding thing. The one bright spot is the outdoor scenery, which is breathtaking shots of the swamps and bayou, and is probably the best scenery in any bigfoot film I've ever seen (and I'm a HUGE bigfoot film geek). Was a nice change of pace from the usual, standard forests.

Eventually our gang goes on a camping trip into the swamp for some reason -- I guess the nice cabin was too good for them? In any event, once out there they are quickly dispatched by the bigfoot. And I mean QUICKLY. After all the long, dull, tedious buildup, the monster takes center stage and slaughters half of the group and chases the other half off into the murky swamps where they also meet their unspeakable fates quickly. We get one final scene that while not a surprise, was a nice touch -- probably the best scene in the whole movie -- and then its over and no one cares. The end.

Sigh. What a disappointment. This could have been a great bigfoot movie. One of the best, maybe. The scenery was spectacular and the monster makeup was top-notch, going more in the wildman direction than the typical big ape design. I really liked it a lot. With a better (less DULL) script wherein something actually HAPPENS in the first hour, and the sheriff and deputy have some real part to play, I could have even forgiven the bad acting by the rest of the players. Oh, and if the sound had been better so that you could actually HEAR the dialogue (and the music was just AWFUL, too).

So I guess if you are a bigfoot fan then this is worth a look. But if you are seeking a good horror film just keep moving, as this has none of the typical nudity, excessive gore (there's some), or suspense of your typical horror flick. I give it two stars for the bigfoot makeup and bayou scenery. Beyond that, most everything else is unfortunately pretty forgettable.",1342483200,,3806,4.4314285714285715

4573362,2,B0055CP9D6,"We get some sporadic Boggy Creek ""Big Foot"" type scenes and some killing/blood stuff then we head into the meat of the film. Jen (Melissa Carnell) has some personal issues and wants to get away to a remote family cabin in the location of questionable monsters. She invites her bff Maya (Shavon Kirksey) to come along with her. Maya in turn invites David (Damon Lipari) an intelligent guy, a hottie who also has issues. Maya thinks Jen and David can ""hook up."" David in turn brings his girl friend Brooke (Stephanie Honore) who is our spoiled city girl. While they are in the cabin, Maya's boyfriend Tommy (Texas Battle) stops by so we can have someone drop a few f-bombs. Dustin (Cory Hart) is the neighbor with a shotgun who lost his wife to ""that thing"" while skinny dipping in the swamp.

The music for the opening jog scene with Jen ran way too long. I thought this was one of those movies that was trying to promote a band. The porch scene had a weird raining/buzzing sound in the background. It was very distracting. Retakes cost money, besides...who will notice?

Eventually the kids go camping and you can figure out the rest. The film spent too much time prior to the camping scene. They should have extended the final killing scenes and cut short the rest of the film. I felt I was watching a movie made by someone who has heard what horror films are about, but has never seen one.
