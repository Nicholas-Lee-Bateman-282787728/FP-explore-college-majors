Actually I had traded my Tony Hawk Trick Tips Vol. 1 for this movie. I'm glad I did. The movie has a lot of skating footage along with tutorials. Tony Hawk's just got down to business. Also, the video teaches you 4x as many tricks, where as you would have to buy all 3 or 4 volumes of hawk's.

The tips are very descriptive and useful. Some videos just say, ""put your feet here and jump swinging your feet this way"". That's not the case in this one. They help you through every step.

As the music goes, if your not a fan of emo, you better rethink what I have just said. About 80% of the movie has the music of Saves The Day (whom I really like now, because to this video actually), and other artists such as The Get Up Kids, and Alkaline Trio.

Sumner's voice can be hard to understand at times, I'll admit that, but the only time you cannot hear what he is saying is if you are just plain not listening to him. You can hear what he is saying.

Last thing that I want to make out is that the first reviewer is right that Tom Green is really only seen in the intro and that Bam Margera only has a couple 1 min. scenes in the film. I fill a little cheated that they mention so much about them, but really they're more of just a marketing ploy.

You should really see this video. It's well worth the money, especially if your a beginner or if you are pretty advanced. This movie is why I still skateboard today.",1148774400,2,1601,4.131832797427653
8167256,5,B0000A0WJY,"the guy that wrote the first review doesn't know what he's talking about. You CAN understand Sumner. The other guy must have not learned english the first 3 years of his life. He probably learned english when he was in high school or something. Everyone prefer's to use their first language because their second or third or whatever isn't as easy as their first language cause whatever language is the easiest to everyone is their FIRST. This DVD/vhs is a great trick tip video, and Sumner doesn't teach EVERY trick so no need to worry about not understanding him or something. This DVD/video teaches the ollie, frontside 180 ollie, backside 180 ollie, kickflip, frontside 180 kickflip, backside 180 kickflip, heelflip, frontside 180 heelflip, backside 180 heelflip, backside boardslide, frontside boardslide, frontside 50-50 grind, backside 50-50 grind, frontside crooked grind, backside crooked grind, backside noseslide, frontside noseslide,  pop-shove it, frontside 5-0 grind, backside 5-0 grind, frontside lipslide, backside lipslide, 360 flip, frontside nosegrind, backside nosegrind, backside feeble grind, frontside feeble grind, frontside smith grind, backside smith grind, frontside 180 nosegrind, backside 180 nosegrind, backside bluntslide, frontside bluntslide, frontside 360 ollie, backside 360 ollie,  frontside nose bluntslide, backside nose bluntslide , the flippy thing (a trick invented by Tom Green), manuals,nose manuels, and slappys. This DVD also includes some great pro skaters and amature skaters skating in the bonus footage and skate montage.",1071273600,6,1569,5.787878787878788
8167257,2,B0000A0WJY,"This is a Brian Sumner film, produced by the slick heads at 900 films. Insight into why Sumner (spirtually) has talent as a skateboarder, is offered up here. However, this film is advertised as being a Bam and Tom Green kinda thing, not the case. Bam's total time in the show is around two minutes, and Tom's bonus footage equals out to four or five minutes. Half of the video is filled with kid's who can skate, but are not instructor's by any means. The music editing is horrible and leaves you guessing as to what is was that Sumner had just said. He is already hard enough to understand, without the crappy soundtrack mixdown. The cinematography is first rate. There are very intense angles and close-ups on the tricks themselves. Some of the best slo-mo work that is availible, resides on this disc. The detailed camera work and menu of tricks does not save this ""film"" from the slew of ""how to"" videos out there.",1068422400,3,918,4.536144578313253
