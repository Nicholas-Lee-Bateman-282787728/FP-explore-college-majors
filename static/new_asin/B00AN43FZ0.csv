8554485,5,B00AN43FZ0,"Well-done video with great in-flight views and details of this great plane. Even though I've been privileged to fly on 3 B-25's (as volunteer crew or simply passenger), I still found this video very interesting. If you haven't been lucky enough to fly on one, this may help to offset your disappointment (slthough nothing beats the real thing!).",1429574400,,345,4.9655172413793105
8554486,1,B00AN43FZ0,I thought this was going to show me what my dad saw or experienced as a WWII navigator - but it was mostly just film of the pilot.  Disappointing.,1399766400,,146,4.0344827586206895
