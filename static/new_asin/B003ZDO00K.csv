4233516,4,B003ZDO00K,"I didn't watched this show when it came out but saw a couple of re-runs and was hooked.  The first 5 seasons were good and the last season was too but, the series finale just didn't do it for me.  I would still recommend it to fans of the show.",1359590400,,244,3.86
4233517,5,B003ZDO00K,"I remember when The Dead Zone was on tv.  I took an instant liking to it but as ratings dropped it also dropped of the face of the earth, well my local stations anyway!  Since buying the box set we have been spending our evenings watching 1, 2, 3 episodes and cant get enough.  We will often say, ""Let's just see what the next one is about"" and then end up watching the whole thing.  I will say you can tell that Season 6 saw some budget cuts, not for the quality of the show but for the number of characters who all left in one episode (dont worry, I havent'given anything away!).  The only problem is that there is no ending!!!!!  The show was cancelled and I guess they were hoping it would be picked up by another network but, alas, it wasn't.  I love this show!!!  Great packaging, good quality viewing, sometimes the menu set up was a little complicated and over the top but we got over that with the great episodes :)  Enjoy!",1333238400,,932,4.220338983050848
4233518,5,B003ZDO00K,"The complete series for only $40 and change is a great deal. I haven't started the to watch the series yet, but have heard good things. I look forward to watching it. The set arrived and it seems to be all in order.",1296691200,,215,4.023255813953488

This was an amazing production by USA Network.  They took the Stephen King novel and played it out into a long (80-episode) series with some fantastic plot twists and a very good (and not overly predictable) continuing story arc.  They did do the same thing with the title that the Christopher Walken movie did; they changed what it meant in the story.  In the book, it's this black area around his visions, and he realizes that the dead zone means that the visions can be changed.  In this series, they punt and call it the part of his brain that lets him see the future.  ""In normal folks, it's a dead zone.""  Uh huh.  Aside from that (extremely minor) complaint, I enjoyed this series.  The casting was very good, too.  A two-year hiatus between the fifth and final seasons did bring about some scheduling problems with some of the actors, and it shows, but they handle it very, very well!

There is one more thing about the show that doesn't take a lot from the enjoyment, but must be said.  The first season is a typical 1/2 season, like so many other shows do.  Then they give us mostly a full season in Season 2 with 19 episodes.  Great!  But then they give us only 12 eps each for seasons 3 and 4 and then 11 eps in season 5 and 13 eps in season 6.  Do the math, and you see that seasons 3 and 4 are 24 episodes and so are seasons 5 and 6 together.

So, when you price this out, be sure to keep that in mind, and realize that you're really only getting four seasons and not six.

DVD SET

This is where I am a little less happy about the show.  First of all, is the first season, with 13 episodes on four discs, and an *empty* disc holder at what should be the Disc 5 slot that advertises that you can get the original pilot episode on a bonus disc if you send in your ""Bounce Back"" card.  That card has not been available for years, but they still sell this set.  The disc is virtually impossible to find, too.  (Beware of an offer I saw regarding Lions Gate selling the ""pilot episode"" on DVD.  It's not the bonus pilot; it's the one that aired and is already in this season.)

The second season is perfect.  No complaints at all!  There are 19 episodes on 5 discs, and they are chock full of extras, from commentaries to deleted scenes, to behind-the-scenes featurettes.

Third season (while short) is also good, with commentary for all episodes, three behind-the-scenes (BTS) featurettes, and deleted scenes and gag reel.

From fourth through sixth seasons, the DVDs become a bit more ""bare bone.""  Fourth season only gives two out of the twelve episodes with commentary, and only one BTS featurette.  It does have deleted scenes.  Fifth season gives you four episodes with commentary (out of 11), deleted scenes, and two featurettes; and the final season only offers four episodes with commentary (out of 13) and 2 featurettes.  No deleted scenes.

So, I give USA Network full marks for a good show, but I call shenanigans for them dividing up the last two seasons into what became the last four seasons and then charging folks the same price for those as they did for the first two seasons.  Especially when they give less in the extras in those seasons, too.  This is why I am giving this collection only 4 stars.  The show is incredibly good (5 stars) while the collection itself is more like 2 or 3 stars.  Since the show outweighs the collection in my mind, I give it 4 stars!",1293926400,19,3402,4.392628205128205
4233520,5,B003ZDO00K,An interesting series to take your mind off what is going on around you.  Buying the complete collection was the only way to go.  To bad the series isn't still in production.,1291852800,7,174,4.40625
4233521,5,B003ZDO00K,"This was a show my family watched together every Sunday night, we turned on the USA network, and sat and enjoyed the stories, the religious overtones, and the unique destruction of the world.  We were all a bit sad when it ended.  I don't know why we never bought the series independently--we got two seasons over the years--but now we're anxious for this set to arrive.

The show was always entertaining, though a few episodes got bogged down to where you just wanted to scream, ""How don't you still believe him?""  It was entertaining, funny, witty, scary, dramatic, emotional, and always interesting.  I highly reccomend this show to anyone looking for a show that they might want to share with their teenage children, and something that the family can sit and watch and enjoy.  It really has something for everyone.",1287964800,17,818,4.807142857142857
4233522,5,B003ZDO00K,"Can't go wrong with this series, esp for the amazing price of 48 dollars for all 6 seasons. Sometimes it's good to wait a bit to make sure you get a good deal. It was a long time ago I watched it and I didn't watch all seasons so I'm looking forward to this.",1384905600,,258,3.7962962962962963
4233523,5,B003ZDO00K,"I loved this show. I never understood why it didn't pick up a bigger fan base. Many of my friends had never heard of it before I showed it to them. Some episodes were creepy and others were light and funny and it always came as a fun surprise. Like many shows, it suffered in the last season from cast changes; it's always a bit sad with a show lasts longer than the actor contracts. However, upon re-watching it I realized that there are some really good episodes in that last season despite my resistance to the cast changes. (The boy who played J.J. in the last season for instance was a very good child actor despite bearing no physical resemblance to the actor he replaced.)",1383955200,,679,4.396825396825397
4233524,5,B003ZDO00K,These came packaged well and as advertised. My wife loves this show and finding this complete set at a great price earned me a lot of brownie points.,1377561600,,149,4.357142857142857
4233525,5,B003ZDO00K,"I had not had the opportunity to see the first shows of the series while it was currently on; therefore, as I'd enjoyed the last couple  of years, I purchased it.  I think it is a good series;  Anyone who likes stories about science fiction, time travel, correcting wrongs that have happened, etc. will enjoy this series.",1376092800,,321,4.5964912280701755
4233526,5,B003ZDO00K,A great gift. My mom saw 2 episodes and was hooked. So happy I wad able to get the whole series she was surprised!,1375228800,,114,3.7916666666666665
4233527,5,B003ZDO00K,I truly enjoyed watching the Dead Zone.  Its unique.  I get so sick of reality tv and cop shows about rape and cereal killers.  Its refreshing to go back.  If you like Quantum Leap I think you might also enjoy this series.,1372118400,,222,4.214285714285714
4233528,5,B003ZDO00K,"Now I've to say other than the oringinal movie; This Dead Zone Series, With Micheal Anthony Hall is so very cool. Hands down this is by far the most out standing as well as the most direct eye dazzling, mind mesmerizing special F/X. Series of its own kind in keeping with the story line of the Oringinal Movie of course. So if you purchase this series you have to obtain the oringinal movie as well. I'd say this is on the list of the Sci-FI guys list for sure. So if anyone out there are looking for something a little different in SI-FI movie along with drama this is the one. AMAZON is the place your gonna want to check out for all your products of course. And of course you've heard it from, The SCI-FI Guy!!!  By the way I've rated this one (5) star of course!!",1366502400,,767,4.1824324324324325

4233531,5,B003ZDO00K,"The Dead Zone was one of my favorite series, and to be able to own the entire series is a real treat.  Of course, it's enjoyable to watch the series, and the extras are fun, as well.  My only caveat to anyone looking for lots of extra goodies is that the extras are fewer and fewer as the series collections go on. However, I purchased it for the show, the writing, and the actors, and there was not a moment of disappointment for me.",1361145600,2,434,4.154761904761905

8410150,5,B003ZDO00K,"This series has a continuous storyline of Johnny's life through all six season, but with each episode, there's a different story - and that keeps the series fresh. I'm a King-er, I love Hall's acting (the whole cast was top-notch), and the writers put me through every emotion in every episode, so I consider this a success.",1391126400,,324,4.701754385964913
