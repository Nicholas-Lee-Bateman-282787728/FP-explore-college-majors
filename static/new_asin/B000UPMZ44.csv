2923675,2,B000UPMZ44,"As others have said, this is a comprehensive, informative, and visually powerful series.  It provides some-- I wouldn't say a lot-- of information about the evolution of life through the age of the dinosaurs.  However, one could learn much more from a book (of course), so I wouldn't term this series highly educational.

My criticism of this series is its gore, and general fright factor.  I am sure BBC/Discovery, a la Disney and every other producer of ""children's"" visual material these days, wanted to make this EXCITING!  And they did.  But I know there are other parents out there, like myself, who long for information and entertainment that does not manipulate with fear and tension-- foreboding narrator's voice, foreboding music, unnecessarily fearful (and at times just ridiculous) script writing, and straight up GORE.  Is it bloody and messy when a carnivore attacks?  Of course.  I don't think the truth of this needs to be sanitized.  But, for example, imparting ""personality"" characteristics to the small-brained attackers instead of keeping it even and real (it's just what carnivores DO; they are probably just as scared as their prey, but they need to eat), all in the name of holding viewers' attention-- well, I find it annoying, frustrating, and unnecessary.  My kids find it tense and scary.  And although my son wants to watch, it so unnerves him that he has finally agreed to let me try to find a ""better"" dinosaur movie.

I don't think that blood appearing to spurt on to the camera lens in any way enriches our learning, or our enjoyment.  Older kids can play a Wii game if they want to see spurting blood (and I know many of them do!).  I'd rather, for now, share information and enjoyment with my kids that doesn't involve computer generated gore and unnecessary, manipulative tension.",1206316800,17,1815,4.9243421052631575

2923686,5,B000UPMZ44,"The precursor of the immensely popular Jurassic Park movies, this series boasts one of the best CGI animation and animatronics combination (at that time) to recreate in living color and motion the Age of the Dinosaurs.
The best part is there no annoying interviews with so called experts who often offer their needless opinions and interrupt the scenes with the dinosaurs.
This is a must own video for dino and nature fans alike. Each 30-minute episode takes you from the humble beginnings of the ruling reptiles all the way to their ultimate demise and the legacy they left behind. The lifelike animation adds to the magic of this documentary in the smooth flow of movements exhibited by creatures long gone.
I love this video!!!",1402531200,,730,4.895161290322581

2923689,4,B000UPMZ44,"I bought this as a Christmas present because my grandson's, aged 2 and 4, love dinosaurs. The animations are wonderful but the boys are too young yet to really appreciate the science that is embedded within the DVDs. But I believe that they will continue to enjoy these DVDs for years to come. I think that this series will allow them to appreciate the science as they continue to mature. I was a bit afraid that this DVD series and The Essential Dinosaur Pack would be to similar but was happy to find out that they are not.",1391644800,,525,4.36734693877551

He watches these shows as often as he can--daily if we let him :-)  He has learned so much from them.  I love that there is a whole hour long show devoted to life before dinosaurs, which is a timeframe that is usually ignored.  We homeschool, and this has been an exceptional edition to our pre-history lessons.  Definitely worth every penny--I recommend it to everyone now!",1390089600,,471,4.482352941176471

Although some of the data is a bit outdated, the CGI and general production values are second to none.  The third DVD is the real gem as the viewer is literally transported into various prehistoric settings in a very realistic manner.  I highly recommend it to fans of the paleo world.",1375142400,,398,4.424657534246576

2923699,5,B000UPMZ44,"I bought all of these separately, but here is the whole set! The BBC series about dinosaurs is fantastic, they really brought to life with good graphics these dinosaurs. These BBC series are not always for the very young, however, as the brutality of the Animal Kingdom is usually shown. For older children and adults this  product is just fine. Here, dinosaurs live again. Very cool set of videos.",1352678400,,398,4.768115942028985
2923700,5,B000UPMZ44,"Disk one has the three episodes of Walking With Monsters (30 minutes each), plus a documentary about Walking with Dinosaurs called Trilogy of Life (30 minutes).

Disk two has the six episodes of Walking With Dinosaurs (30 minutes each) and includes the option of having the occasional picture-in-picture which describes the behind-the-scenes.

Disk three has the two Chased By Dinosaurs episodes (Land of Giants and The Giant Claw (30 minutes each)), and the three Sea Monsters episodes (30 minutes each). These are all done in the style of a man being sent back in time to investigate the creatures like a modern day naturalist doing a nature program. Finally, there is Allosaurus (also known as The Ballad of Big Al, 30 mins) which follows the life of a single Allosaurus.

I have previously borrowed the regular VHS of Allosaurus, which featured a good 30 minute ""Making Of"" at the end, which is unfortunately missing from this collection. The only other missing BBC tv programs from the same makers is Walking With Beasts, but that would be a whole extra DVD worth and you can buy it separately anyway.

The biggest flaw is the obvious - most of it is based on educated guesses, since all we really have is a load of bones and footprints rather than actually being able to observe dinosaurs in the wild. But since the whole point is to show these ancient creatures in the same way as a modern-day nature program, that is a bit of a silly objection. It came in a cardboard case which was squashed a bit when I received it, but that wasn't as big a deal as it not having any contents list anywhere - the only indication of what is included is written on the disks themselves so I had to do my own research to see if anything was missing.

Overall, it is a wonderful set and good value for money. My children love it. I'd give it 4.5 out of 5, but at this price it is worth rounding up to 5/5.",1351036800,4,1894,4.478260869565218
2923701,5,B000UPMZ44,"This collection was purchased as a birthday gift for my grandson. I have not personally seen the series, but my son (and his son) say it is totally awesome and thank the makers for such an informational and first-rate production.",1350691200,,229,4.75

2923705,5,B000UPMZ44,My ten year old son LOVES dinosaurs and walks around with the Dinopedia book.  This was s great set of film that are informative and realistic for older children that are dinosaur lovers.,1325721600,,187,4.666666666666667
2923706,5,B000UPMZ44,This has been a great collection to have. I have three children 4 to 10 years old that all are very interested in paleontology and they can all watch this series together without fighting over who gets' to pick! That alone is worth the price to a Mom! This collection offers so many details and facts that they learn new things every time they watch.,1306540800,,350,4.4
2923707,5,B000UPMZ44,"My son is fascinated by all things dinosaur and dragon.  He loved this series.  it was a great hit!  I was a little worried that it might scare him since he's only 5 but although he got a little grossed out over some of the bloody scenes, he wasn't frightened at all.  Very well done with narration and it was the best 3 hours of quiet time I had in awhile.",1300752000,2,357,3.9859154929577465
2923708,5,B000UPMZ44,I am very very happy with this purchase. The flashlight is very well made. When you put the batteries in it this thing is very solid. It's extremely bright and the focus beam works just like any other Mag light. It's good to have a quality flashlight in the car or house just in case. This one won't disappoint.,1299715200,,311,4.288135593220339
2923709,5,B000UPMZ44,"Our neighbor borrowed this set from the library and loaned to us to watch. My 2 and 6 yr old children loved it. They are fascinated by dinosaurs and watched these DVD's over and over again. I am now buying them so they can watch them all the time. There is a little blood, but my children have been reading about meat eaters and plant eaters for a long time now. They seem to understand and weren't bothered by it. Both kids asked for these instead of cartoons. I'll give them educational DVD's over cartoons any day!! Yes...it tells of Evolution...but since God created the scientists that ""discovered"" Evolution...it's okay by me.",1297728000,,632,4.651785714285714
2923710,2,B000UPMZ44,I was a little bummed out by this. I bought it for my son who is 4 and loves dinosaurs. We watched some youtube videos of  discovery channels walking with dinosaurs and this was not the same thing. He watched it. One of the discs is cool. the others were a lil boring for him.,1295136000,,276,4.0181818181818185
2923711,5,B000UPMZ44,"If your little boy (or girl) is into dinosaurs, this DVD collection will not disappoint.
The segments ""Walking with Monsters"" and ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" (narrated by Kenneth Branagh) provide an informative overview of the evolution of life on earth preceding and through the reign of the dinosaurs. You feel like you are there with nice little touches like the creatures occasionally bumping into the camera.
The segments that comprise ""Chased by Dinosaurs,"" hosted/narrated by Nigel Marven, are perhaps the most entertaining for children because it brings to life every dino-loving child's fantasy: to be a time-traveling paleontologist. Marven is just that, dropping himself into and exploring the world of the dinosaurs and their ancestors, with all the excitement and danger that one would expect suddenly being confronted with when roaming around in the time of such creatures. It is all played straight and it comes off as a real documentary--aside from the high improbability that anyone could actually survive any one of (let alone all) the close encounters Marvin has.
""Allosaurs"" provides a glimpse into how today's paleontologist's use the information revealed by the fossils that are discovered to piece together possible scenarios about how the dinosaurs lived and eventually died.
All segments are expertly done and strike a fine balance between education and entertainment. My son loved every minute of the entire collection and his new greatest wish--after wishing that Pokemon were real--is to have the special map that Nigel Marven uses to travel back to the seven deadliest seas in the ""Walking with"" segment, ""Sea Monsters.""
In terms of what age this material is appropriate for...as one would expect in the age of the dinosaurs, they hunt, kill, and eat each other. Any such depictions in this collection are only meant to be an authentic representation of life during those time and I did not find any to be gratuitously violent or gruesome. But, just know that it does happen and parents buying this for children should consider this when trying to determine if their child is old or mature enough for such depictions. My son was 9 when we got this for him but he has been watching BBC documentaries such as ""Blue Planet,"" ""Planet Earth,"" and ""Life"" (all of which are great) since he was about 5 or 6.",1294617600,4,2326,5.075718015665796
2923712,5,B000UPMZ44,"This is a great collection.  I do agree some of it is graphic, but it is correct.  My 3 and 4 year olds actually choose these movies over cartoons.  They are educational, attention grabbing, well detailed, and depict the true food chain.  I would recommend this collection to anyone.",1293235200,2,283,4.714285714285714
2923713,4,B000UPMZ44,"This is a very interesting collection, three discs with multiple chapters per disc.
What I enjoyed firstly, there was a significant amount of information I didn't know, the graphics were well above average throughout the DVD series, and may have accurately depicted life on earth as it developed.
It covered all the timeframes from lifes' earliest beginnings through the end of the dinosaurs.
Many of the hypothesis it put forward were intriguing, and may have been factual in history.
The documentary series covered all planetary aspects from Oceans to Land to Air and included the development of the continents from Pangea to something approaching what we have today, including polar regions.
This series did not just focus on the well known species, but really in as much as could be expected, delved into lives' great diversity - even down to the parasites!
What I didn't like was the factual documentary basis without proof - we didn't KNOW what it was like then, unless the BBC has managed to get the Tardis to work!
Other than that - great entertainment and very educational, and not just for Children.",1291939200,8,1109,4.935828877005347

We took them to see the Walking with Dinosaurs arena experience and they were so excited about seeing all the dinosaurs.  I looked around and found this DVD collection.  We have had it less than a month and it is the only thing my son wants to watch, my daughter will go between one of these movies or a princess movie.  The dvd's are well produced, educational and it all looks so real.  Our favorite episode is the Chased by Dinosaurs.  These are rather long movies, but will keep my childrens' attention throughout the entire movie.  My husband and I haven't gotten board with the repetition yet and usually see something new we hadn't seen in one of hundred other viewings of these movies.  Definitely worth every penny and more.  If you want to own a dinosaur movie this collection is all you need.  Jurasic Park has nothing on these movies.",1281398400,3,906,4.4969325153374236

Some people perhaps don't care for their kids to know about evolution, but I do.  It's one of those things that just doesn't need to be on for a 4yr old to watch b/c I believe God made the heavens & the earth.  I don't believe man came from a dumb ape! Evolution shouldn't be on a kids DVD b/c some people believe & some people don't.. So let us choose if we want them to learn that or not!

It met, then exceeded, my expectations for this DVD.  Some of the scenes are graphic, but it is truly Nature's Way.  Nothing was overdone to the point of mindless violence, just depicting the true relationship in Nature between a predator and its' prey.  It is so realistic, that I found it fascinating.....this is really good stuff!  I recommend it for kids that love this subject!",1262649600,3,579,4.607843137254902
2923721,1,B000UPMZ44,"We were extremely disappointed in this DVD. In comparison to other BBC productions,this one really is ""POOR"".
The graphics are poor quality, not sharp and crisp. The context of the narration, was totally unfounded.
It spoke of 500 million years and the transmission of time as fact, when in truth it is only theory. I know
that Dinosaurs were present at on time, and that is fact. The evolution of life as we know it today,and
when and how that took place is speculation and theory only.
The one and only portion of this collection that was appreciated, was the last selection where it gave the viewer
a size comparison from 'us' to 'them'
In closing I wish I could get my money back, but it looks like this DVD will be a garage sale item for a buck.

Thank you for this opportunity to give feed back.

I got caught up in watching it with them and I gotta say, it's just like being there. They tell the story of these magnificent creatures with incredible accuracy and make you really care about them. I loved it! Everybody should see this. I'd pay money at the movies to see it on the big screen if I had a chance. Did I mention how much I loved it?",1253404800,,470,4.064516129032258
2923723,5,B000UPMZ44,"Yes, yes, this is truly great stuff, but sooner or later you have to come back down to Earth, (or, back to the present). What I'm saying is, this series is superb, and takes you ""there"", at least as much as we can expect. There's tons of realistic-looking/moving dinosaurs,(except with ""all"" dinosaur documentaries and movies- never try and make a Tyrannosaur or Allosaur ""leap"" into the air after something!), and you might just be amazed on occasion, but I would highly recommend you also get the ""Discovery Essential Dinosaur Pack"" to perfectly compliment this set. The Discovery set also includes plenty of great ""being there"" dinosaur stuff as well, but also incorporates plenty of actual scientific research, and how things are analysed through various stages as shown and explained by many world-renowned paleontologists.

For me, it was less than satisfying purchase because my kid has already watched the entire ""Prehistoric Planet"" on Discovery. And ""Prehistoric Planet"" is just  ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" dubbed with an American accent, it is exactly the same show. Another nitpick is that the first DVD in this series forces you to watch (no fast forward) the ads for the other 3 that you've already bought.",1246492800,5,563,4.854166666666667

Though my children liked the Chased by Dinosaurs segment it was my least favorite because it seemed a  bit confusing to my children to do the whole human traveling back in time to be with the dinosaurs when we have stressed that dinosuars and humans were not around at the same time.  But that is a small contention for such a fine educational film.,1237248000,2,606,4.463636363636364
2923730,5,B000UPMZ44,"I gave this collection to my 7 year old son who loves dinosaurs.  Both he and my 4 year old daughter love to watch them.  I enjoy them too.  The word ""mating"" is mentioned now and then, but so far they haven't shown anything inapropriate for kids.  Not as ""feel good"" and ""happy"" as the Land Before Time dinosaur shows but obviously much more educational.  I would definately give this as a gift to any child over the age of 6 who loves dinosaurs!",1234569600,,447,4.273809523809524
2923731,5,B000UPMZ44,Excellent videos.  Very educational but in a fun way and they look very real!!  My 4 year old is obsessed with dinos and watches these videos every chance he gets.  Only caution is if you don't want to see dinosaurs hunting / biting / eating each other :),1232496000,,255,4.270833333333333
2923732,4,B000UPMZ44,"What I find with a lot of documentaries is that they can be repetitious, not the case with these ones except for a couple of things here and there. Although I wish they would have analized a few more species, the depth of information justifies how they did it. My 5 year old son was hypnotized by it. Very entertaining. I liked the way they showed a ""evolution fast-forward"" (in between chapters) which allows you to see the changes. I also liked the ""years ago"" gauge on the top of the screen. I wish they would have also included the genealogy trees of these beasts but it was worth it the 27 dollars I paid for it",1230508800,2,616,4.273504273504273
2923733,5,B000UPMZ44,"According to my 5 yr old dinosaur obsessed son, this is the ""best movie ever."" It came in very handy while he was sick because he watched all of the videos in one sitting. The only thing is that the dinosaurs look so real in the movie, I have to remind my son that they are extinct!!! Good job BBC!",1230336000,3,298,3.9833333333333334
2923734,5,B000UPMZ44,"I think it is fantastic. My four year old child is a dinonsaur fanatic and this is a gold mine for him. I've seen a couple slightly negative reviews about the computer animated artwork. It's for kids, not for geeked out adults. It's the best, your kids will love it!",1229904000,,266,4.34
2923735,5,B000UPMZ44,as i have seen parts of this cd. i know my grandchildren will love this as they are crazy about dinosaurs and will be getting this for christmas.,1229212800,,145,4.214285714285714
2923736,5,B000UPMZ44,"Every CGI ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" you could want, even the Nigel Marvin specials ""Chased By Dinosaurs."" Great imagery, great fun for the armchair palentologist or the kids. Some scenes may be a bit scary for the little ones, but overall just superb education in a fun format.",1224288000,,276,4.8936170212765955
2923737,3,B000UPMZ44,"In my opinion, these movies have terrific graphics and the varied ""directing"" approaches made the shows even more believable.  However, while my husband and I enjoyed watching them through once, there are a couple things we both didn't like.
It's a fact of life that critters in the animal kingdom can be brutal, but the creators seem to go out of their way to focus on bloody mess.  Also, there appears to be a lot of science fiction being presented as scientific facts.  Artistic interpretation can add much to the quality of a show, but we feel that creative speculation should be clearly presented as opinions/ideas.  Likewise, it would be nice to hear the word ""theory"" used more often on these topics.
We bought these shows primarily because our our young children (ages nine & under) like to learn about dinosaurs, and we want them to enjoy nature and science shows, but we're not comfortable letting them watch this series yet.",1222732800,20,935,4.788819875776397

2923740,4,B000UPMZ44,My kids absouluty love these movies! They ask me every day if they can watch them. My 2 year old is even starting to name the dinosaurs now. I would def recommend these movies to anyone with dino lovers out there,1212278400,4,212,4.195121951219512
2923741,5,B000UPMZ44,"My 4-y-o son is completely obsessed with dinosaurs.  I was concerned about the level of violence/gore in the program, but after watching one episode on cable with him and seeing that he was unaffected by it, I bought the series.  Once we got past the ""yes, dinosaurs ate one another"" factor, I've been AMAZED by how quickly he's learning the real names (triceratops versus ""three-horn"" that he learned from THE LAND BEFORE TIME) and facts about the various prehistoric creatures.  When he told me that ""dimetrodon was the largest carnivore on Earth when he lived!"" I just about fell over.  He loves it.  I'm delighted.

CHASED BY DINOSAURS is a ""Crocodile Hunter"" style integration of dinosaurs and the narrator running around the prehistoric landscape in a kind of high-tech LAND OF THE LOST.  If anything, I'm a little bothered by the false impression that's making.  But it's a lot of fun.

My only note of caution is that WALKING WITH MONSTERS is available as a separate DVD, and if you're used to seeing it as ""Before the Dinosaurs"" (the subtitle), it could be easy to do what I did and buy it separately, and end up with two copies.  Both of which were immediately opened by an enthusiastic 4-y-o, so not returnable.  Backup copies are good, though, for something this insanely popular at our house!",1212019200,12,1305,4.7555555555555555

Two thumbs up!",1210723200,18,302,4.067796610169491
2923744,5,B000UPMZ44,"My 6 year old son is crazy about dinosaurs. I noticed he didn't like the educational shows that are featured on PBS and similar channels. When he discovered the BBC series he was glued to the television. He loves sharing the stories with me during dinner.  The special effects, narration, story line, and dinosaur action really captures his attention. This is an excellent video for dinosaur fans.",1208736000,7,397,4.925373134328358
