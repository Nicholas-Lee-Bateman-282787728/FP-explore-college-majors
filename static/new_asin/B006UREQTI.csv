It's hard to sit through this video without noticing the tired musicians with little energy and lack of showmanship. There's about 50 people in the crowd and it seems like they were asleep the whole time! This is a waste of a good opportunity to make something fantastic. Vicentico's music is awesome, however, his Live performances Have yet to do anything for me. Terrible concert. Boring.",1379376000,,536,5.033707865168539
8504683,4,B006UREQTI,"After his fourth studio album, 'Solo un momento' (2010), Vicentico returns with a new live album that revisits the prior one as well as a few songs from previous records. After recording several performances in Buenos Aires with the idea of releasing a live album, Vicentico decided he wanted to do something different and ended up planning and recording it live in the Provincia de Corrientes in Argentina. The result? A great performance by Gabriel and his band filled with stunning visuals deserving of a better release, perhaps in HD?

The album includes 8 out of 12 songs released in 'Solo un momento', all 5 singles released are performed live here, including the version of Franco Simone's he made of 'Paisaje' for the movie 'Viudas' (the studio version as well as the trailer for the movie were included in the CD+DVD re-release of the aforementioned album)

The album opens with 'Ya no te quiero', from the very beginning both Vicentico and the band sound natural and it is clear they feel comfortable with what they are doing; as he states in the included 3 minute documentary, the place and the view were great and did help their performance to look natural. One of the intentions of Vicentico when forming this band was to have musicians that could shine on their own, in his own words, he wanted 'everyone to be an artist on their own', the result can be heard in the CD and seen on screen.

'Cobarde', 'Viento' and 'El pacto' follow and sound in my opinion, better than in the studio album, it is clear that after performing these live over time they have improved. The first surprise of the album comes in track 5, 'Bajando la calle' ('Vicentico', 2003), the song sounds as great as it did when released in Vicentico's first solo album. 'Paisaje' has to be my favorite track of the whole album, the arrangements and the feeling with which Vicentico sings his version make it a highlight of the album.

'Luca' prepares the tone for Vicentico to perform 'El rey del rock n roll' (the last single released from 'Solo un momento') 'Si me dejan' ('Los pajaros', 2006) is another surprise from his third studio album. 'Morir a tu lado' and 'Solo un momento' are the last songs of the show prior to an encore that includes 'Basta de llamarme asi' from his Los Fabulosos Cadillacs era and 'Los caminos de la vida' ('Los Rayos', 2004), as explained by Vicentico, the first officially edited live version of this song original by Omar Geles.

Now onto the technical details of the DVD. The video is presented in anamorphic widescreen for those with HDTV sets, and even though the disc is a DVD, the video quality is overall quite good (I am not denying it could look better though) The first thing you will notice when playing the DVD is that there is no setup menu, neither the booklet nor the disc include any specification on the audio output. My receiver recognizes a Dolby Digital input but I was not able to figure out if it is a 5.1 or else. The audio is quite acceptable and I was able to improve it by twitching the audio options in my Onkyo receiver. For those interested in importing this, the video is NTSC and the disc is region free (0)

Overall, another great release from Vicentico  that could have been a little bit better on its DVD edition, this the reason why I am taking one star off a release that deserved a 5 star treatment. Fans of Vicentico and rock from Argentina will not be disappointed after getting this.",1331683200,2,3440,4.601957585644372
