2545896,4,B000EXZFR6,"The 1956/57 Season of ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" was perhaps one of the greatest in television. First, the last 3 episodes of ""The Classic 39"" aired. Second, the variety show format returned allowing Gleason to play ALL his popular characters. Finally, introducing the musical format to the ""Original Trip To Europe"" episodes. At the time Gleason was competing against Perry Cuomo for ratings. Unfortunately, not as many people watched those ""Trip To Europe"" shows. Video tape did not exist, and none of those shows were ever repeated. The following year, Art Carney left to do other projects and it wasn't until Art Carney became available again in 1966 that ""The Honeymooners"" aired regularly again. I was fortunate to watch a couple of the ""Orginal Trip To Europe"" shows at The Museum Of Broadcasting. Comparing both versions is like comparing apples to oranges. Art Carney looked better, and performed better in the earlier incarnation. Gleason on the other hand is more relaxed and very happy again playing Ralph Kramden in the 60's version. Sheila MacRae and Jane Kean are fine as Alice and Trixie. In fact, Jane Kean was so good that Jackie Gleason did not replace her in later Specials from the 1970's. The quality of the video is not as good as I wished, but it shouldn't discourage people from enjoying these wonderful shows. The chemistry of Gleason and Carney are as powerful as ever. The songs are not a distraction, but help move the stories along in the tradition of Broadway Musicals of the 40's,50's, and 60's. Songs like ""You Will Always Be My Friend"", ""You Mustn't Judge A Book By It's Cover"" and ""Hospitality"" are rather catchy tunes. I take a star away only because the shows are not shown with Gleason's Opening Monalogues. I look forward to watching future episodes of these color editions.",1158364800,4,1812,4.886363636363637
2545897,4,B000EXZFR6,"Growing up during the 1960s, ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" was for me one of the best variety shows ever...and I truly loved the shows with the ""Honeymooners."" We're talking about the shows that had Sheila MacRae (Alice)and Jane Kean (Trixie), plus Sammy Spear's orchestra and the June Taylor dancers added to the mix as the gang embarks on their European adventure - I can recall seeing a number of the episodes when they first aired.

Kudos to MPI for fantastic remastering, but unfortunately with just one extra (the too-short ""Gleason Express"" vignette), I am kind of disappointed.  Next time, please include more extras!!!",1155686400,7,623,5.038834951456311
2545898,5,B000EXZFR6,"Being born in 1964, some of my earliest memories of watching television was of hearing the announcer yell MIAMI BEACH while watching the rapid close-up of the city appear on the scereen and of the closing of this show with the little caricature of JG in his ""Away we go"" stance at the end of the credits.

So for me and a lot of other small children in the late 60s, THIS is the Jackie Gleason Show that we remember.

Now of course fans of the original 1950s Honeymooners may coomplain about the comparison, but having seen this for the first time since I was a small child, nostalgia aisde it's really good on it's own. Art Carney and JG are in fine form and the later actresses who play Alice and Trixie (who were actually the third to do so) do a pretty good imitation of Joyce Randolph and Audrey Meadows. It does help to avoid any memory or comparison to the 50s episodes to fully enjoy this.

The musical numbers are a tad cornball by modern standards, but interesting as a time capsule of what variety shows were like in the 60s. Look carefully and you'll see Mercedes Ellignton (Graddaughter of the legendary Duke Ellington) among the dancers.

So on it's own, it IS pretty entertaining. Incidentally, the liner notes promise a DVD of the ""Jackie Gleason Show"" (sans Honeymooners) also from MPI in the near future. Ooh Goody good good (as JG would say). Modern viewers will see JG in FULL form with Crazy Guggenheim, The Poor Soul, Reggie Van Gleason, and Timmie ""Oh Yeah"" Rogers (a pioneering Black comedian). So look out for that and enjoy this in the meantime.",1153267200,10,1571,4.52112676056338
2545899,3,B000EXZFR6,"As noted in the Amazon.com synopsis, these are segments from Jackie Gleason's CBS variety show in 1966. They are hour-long, musical (!) ""Honeymooners"" segments in which the Kramdens and the Nortons travel to Europe and have various adventures.

While I enjoyed these episodes and am glad I have more ""Honeymooners"" in my DVD collection, I nevertheless get the impression that this is where Gleason's comedic style, as with Lucille Ball's in the 1960's, started to calcify. The black-and-white ""Honeymooners"" seems more ""authentic,"" if you will -- you really get the sense that this is a couple barely making ends meet. By contrast, in the color eps, you can see Gleason and Carney really playing to the crowd. Every time a familiar bit of shtick comes, the audience goes crazy -- a precursor of the whooping and hollering yahoos you hear on live-audience sitcoms these days.

And in the B&W eps, Gleason is far more believable as a pale, manic, barely-getting-by bus-driver. It's kind of hard to identify with the Kramdens when each episode begins with a splashy production number, and once-pale Ralph sports a Miami tan.

Lastly, some of the writing is a bit open-ended, such as the episode where Kramden and Norton are stranded at sea. (Spoiler alert here.) In one scene, they're in a lifeboat; in the next and final scene, there's a quick wrap-up where their rescue is barely mentioned. They get all sorts of press coverage for their Flakey Wakey trip and hardly anyone even notices a rescue at sea?

This is nit-picking, I know, and again, I am glad to have the DVD. Still, some of these sore points tend to stick out. If you're enough of a ""Honeymooners"" fan, though, you'll probably overlook these problems.

Video quality is excellent. There's only one ""extra"" feature, but it's an interesting mini-documentary about ""The Great Gleason Express,"" in which Gleason took himself and his crew on a heavily-publicized cross-country train tour to move his TV show from New York City to Miami Beach (""the sun-and-fun capital of the world,"" as announcer Johnny Olson intones at the start of each episode).",1153180800,26,2104,4.949008498583569
2545900,4,B000EXZFR6,"Yes,MPI has finally started its' release of the Jackie Gleason Show. This set gleans its' material from the 1966-70 series which was filmed in colour. It contains the ""Trip To Europe"" series first done back in the late 50s. It's an updated and I think just as good version as its' black and white counterpart.

This was the first(Gleason) show series to be shot in colour and Gleason certainly makes effective use of the medium as is evidenced by the myriad of coulourful costumes worn by both cast and crew.

Now before I go any further I think for the sake of those that have read the above ""review"" by Mr. Gaita I should clarify two essential points.

Firstly is that this set is a three disc set,with nine episodes.

Secondly these are NOT hour long sketches nor are the entire shows one sees here an hour long. Indeed no Honeymooners sketch in any Gleason show(excluding specials of course) were ever one hour in length. The running time of these shows range anywhere from 46-49 minutes...in total.

What has happened is,for whatever reason,MPI has CUT Gleasons' entire opening monologue sequence. What we get is everything AFTER that,i.e. the Honeymooners sketch and,if time permitted because sometimes it didn't,Gleasons' closing words,thank you to the audience and introduction of the cast. The cutting of the opening is certainly not a make or break situation but it is VERY disappointing and the big reason I gave this set a star less than it should get.

With that aside let's get back to the review. I must say that I never saw any of Gleasons shows in colour because I simply didn't own a colour set until years later. Only the more financially well to do in my neighbourhood had colour sets and those I did see sported this terrible reddish-greenish blury picture. I was quite happy to stick with my B&W.

MPI has done a pretty good job in presenting these shows but not a great one. The clarity is fine but the film just shows its' age much more than it should and I think a better job could have been done to bring it up to the standard of other shows from that same time.

As far as Gleason,Carney,Kean and McCrae are concerned I just can't say enough about them. The two principles are right on top of their form the entire way through. Their chemistry is immediately apparent and they know their characters inside and out and the fun they have with each other spills out to us(and the live audience then).Kean and McCrae of course are no slouches in their departments considering the big shoes they had to fill. Remember the so called Classic 39 were still on TV at this time and everyone who watched THIS show were intimately familiar with that one. There were unfair comparisons then and there are now with their counterparts Meadows and Randolph. In my oppinion there is and never was any comparison at all. No one could take Meadows and Randolphs' places and both Kean and McCrae knew this from the get go. So they did THEIR thing not imitations,which would have fallen as flat as a pancake had they attempted to do so. Therefore the new dynamic they brought to their parts blended nicely with Gleason and Carneys roles. This oppinion has never been a popular one with hardcore fans of the Honeymooners,but it's one I've never waivered from since those years when I first saw them.

I must also give a special mention to the June Taylor dancers. I had forgotten but seeing these talented people again after almost 40 years is a pleasure in itself. They were a hard working bunch of hoofers to be sure and I invite viewers to pay special attention to the dancing in the Irish segment of this series. The footwork would make even Michael Flatley jealous I'm sure!

This is Vol#1 of what I hope will be a total release of all the Honeymooners sketches from this show of this period. I believe there are somewhere around 33 sketches left to be released,if this is MPIs' plans that is. Remember also that NOT every Jackie Gleason show had a Honeymooners sketch. Like Jackies' early 50s shows the sketches done on this particular series could be of various lengths also,if as I say there was one done at all.

Lastly I should mention that this series(The Trip to Europe) has been the only one previously syndicated and released on TV.On TV it also included a sketch called ""King of the Castle"".This had them back home and some events that happen after the trip. MPI must have thought this particluar segment didn't warrant inclusion because it wasn't technically part of the ""trip"",so I'm sure it will be released on a future set.

In conclusion I would certainly recommend this set to any Honeymooners fan and having said that this set should not be relegated just to ""die -hard"" fans of the show,as the editorial ""review"" states. Nothing could be further from the truth. These shows are light,true to the Honeymooner format and an experience the whole family can enjoy. And come to think of it that's exactly who were watching and enjoying them back in 1966!

It also states that these sketches ""are weighed down"" by the musical numbers. This is also,in my oppinion,total bunk. The numbers compliment and sometimes enhance the sequences. It is absolutely precious to see both Carney and Gleason arm in arm singing their hearts out before us. And their small ""dance"" routines together have to be seen. It's a beautiful thing!

The work MPI has done on them certainly could have been better and their cutting of Gleasons' entire opening sequence is a travesty but as I stated earlier not a deal breaker.

This is a set that belongs in everyones' DVD collection!",1153180800,30,5578,4.665987780040733
2545901,5,B000EXZFR6,"I love the Color Honeymooners, the first I ever saw of Ralph, Ed, Alice and Trixie back in the 60's.'

The amazon review said it was a 4-disc set. Huh? It says 3-disc in the picture on the box.

Also where is the epiosode ""King Of The Castle"", supposedly part of a ""10 episode The Honeymooners Trip To Europe package""?",1153008000,4,318,4.283333333333333
2545902,4,B000EXZFR6,"I was fairly unsure of this as a purchase. Once I heard there was a new Alice and there was singing and dancing I was a bit aghast. At first you may experience a bit of a culture shock. This show is somewhat like a Broadway musical of ""the Honeymooners"" and not all of it works. However, once you get past the frills and dated format you will see the heart of the Gleason/Carney One/Two punch and they are still unmatched. I think Sheila MacRae and Jane Kean pull off a very good Alice and Trixie, which was a major concern I had. I never really cared much for Joyce Randolph, and Audry Meadows while a true classic is handled nicely here.

I mainly lopped a star off because of this MPI production. Or M.more P.product I.insults as I call them. They went the whole 5.1 route and yet only made this ""Collection One"" I would have much preffered this to be ""Season One"". This is merely the ""Europe"" leg of this particular season. Also, oddities like not being able to use the ""last memory"" from my DVD is typical MPI foolishness. The picture quality varies wildly also.

I Netflixed Disc one and I'm still going to purchase this set. It starts pretty rough but once you adjust to the singing and dancing you'll be OK. In fact, many of the songs Gleason and Carney perform are actually quite good and I do not even care much for Broadway style music.

If you are a Gleason fan this is a must!! And awaaay we go!!!",1151625600,6,1410,4.313207547169811
2545903,5,B000EXZFR6,"I am thrilled to know that at last, after 36 years, the the ""Color Honeymooners"" from the Jackie Gleason Show are being released.  For many of us, the black and white Honeymooners are what we think of when we hear about the Honeymooners.  But for the rest of us, these programs from the 1960s were our introduction.  Who can forget the color, the excitement, the music, and the comedy? The blue and white opening image of ""the sun and fun capitol of the world - Miami Beach"" was thrilling!

The Jackie Gleason Show was a wonderful variety show during a time when folks stayed at home on Saturday nights and were entertained by a true genious and the actors, writers and crew who were involved in the show.  The show has a genuine stage show feel to it with the laughter, applause, songs, opening, and the bows.  I remember the frequent breeze on the stage which moved the actors clothing.

Thank you, thank you for all of those involved in this production and release of the classic program!

Please release the variety shows which alternated every othere week with the Honeymooners.

How sweet it is!!!!!!!!!!",1150588800,9,1110,4.651282051282052
2545904,5,B000EXZFR6,"I bought this collection, along with collections two and three.  I remember watching these as a little boy.  Each show is full of great comedy, great music, and great dancing.  To me, each episode is like a Broadway musical.  These are eloborate productions.  It is amazing how Jackie Gleason and Art Carney are back in their characters from the very first episode.  It seems many of the episodes are repeats of ones they did in the 1950's.  However, there is great dancing and singing in these which the originals did not have.  So to my mind, they are different.  They stand on their own.

Seeing Gleason's glamour girls at the beginning of each show brings back memories.  I used to love when he would come out at the end of each show and have a smoke, and drink some ""tea,"" or ""coffee.""  My favorite part was when he would bellow out, ""SHEILA MACRAE,"" ""JANE KEAN,"" ""ART CARNEY!""  I really appreciate people who bring laughter into my life.  Jackie Gleason certainly did that.  Big time!",1322870400,5,990,4.609195402298851
2545905,5,B000EXZFR6,"This is a great set. The 60's color Honeymooners have a different Alice and Trixie, but it will not take you long to be won over.  They are all excellent and as funny as the old 50's show. These are an hour long and feature the June Taylor Dancers and musical numbers by any combination of Ralph, Norton, (the new) Alice or the (new) Trixie.

In this series, they win a trip around the world.  My favorite episode is when they go to Italy and a little boy gets a crush on Alice. Ralph hears her talking on the phone and tells Norton, ""I heard his name at the end of the conversation. It was Harry VaDerchi."" Lots and lots of great humor and colorful scenery.

In the middle 60's, every other week on ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" they would do ""The Honeymooners."" On alternate weeks, it was the Jackie Gleason (variety) show.  These are just The Honeymooners.

Great set!",1314316800,3,867,4.3875
2545906,5,B000EXZFR6,"I was born about the time the Original 39 were filmed, so I never saw them when they were originally broadcast. I only saw them in syndication, they were funny, in a sitcom way. (And, yes I own a set of the Original 39.) What I remember more were the 1960s Jackie Gleason Show with and without the Honeymooners sketches. Watching the Color Honeymooners brings back those memories of Saturday nights when I was 11. The shows that I've seen appear to be missing little (just the opening monologue and commercials). Some reviewers say these shows don't hold a candle to the original 50s shows, so these shows are a waste of your money. I disagree with that, the shows were fine entertainment when they were first broadcast and they are still worth your money if you enjoy them and I do enjoy these shows.",1313107200,5,801,4.531034482758621
2545907,1,B000EXZFR6,"For starters, I love The Honeymooners. I grew up on the ""Classic 39"" and was delighted to discover the lost episodes later on. The ""Color"" Honeymooners was an interesting curio in the history of The Honeymooners series but it's a total waste of time if you already have seen the lost episodes. A large majority of these new color episodes are little more than remakes of old honeymooners sketches from the early 1950's which were far better timed and acted. The songs in these new episodes are largely forgetable time wasters that merely justify an hour long time slot. Just skip this set and hunt the old B&W treasures.",1304640000,4,620,4.697247706422019
2545908,1,B000EXZFR6,"My apologies in advance since I do not own any of these DVD sets, but I've been vainly attempting to discern what the actual content of this product is and I'm literally horrified by what I believe I'm reading.  The gist of the reviews is that these discs are not really of the Jackie Gleason Show, but instead are only the extracted Honeymooners segments - is this correct?  It sounds as though a few of the reviewers might be familiar with the original show, but if so, they are doing a poor job of contrasting the content of the discs with the original.  I see that a couple folks have mentioned that Jackie's opening monologues have been cut.  This is hideous.  Folks, we're talking about history here, not just entertainment, and I've been noticing more and more of this 'creative editing' by these shameless media peddlers.  Those of you who rated this product highly should be ashamed of yourselves, regardless of the quality of what was finally released.
For me, the Honeymooners segment of Jackie's variety show was the *least* entertaining aspect of the program, as a couple of the reviewers here have insinuated.  Instead, I enjoyed Sammy Spear's awesome Jackie Gleason Orchestra and their frequent special performances of the great standards (so popular were they that they ended up making actual recordings), Jackie's unannounced special guests, his skits featuring his own characters:  Reginald Van Gleason III, Rudy the Repairman, and the wonderful portrayal of the 'poor soul' were among my favorites.  But who could forget the great Joe the Bartender skit with Frank Fontaine's wonderful baritone singing after Joe coaxes him?  Since I was young, I didn't think much of the June Taylor dancers, but I now realize that it was all a part of the show.  Are you folks trying to tell me that all this stuff has been cut??  If so, this is an outrage and should be called out as such.",1271030400,6,1894,4.793846153846154
2545909,2,B000EXZFR6,"Anyone into the Honeymooners might like ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" 's Brad Garrett (the big cop) playing Jackie Gleason in a movie. The movie's called ""Gleason,"" and it wasn't bad. Garrett even manages to hide his 6'7 height well. And the voice is almost dead-on.

The first group (quick re-dos of the old black and whites with added music and dancing) were great fun to do and proved so popular that we did three more seasons of brand new shows. Mr G and dear Art were in their element, and great fun was had by all. Lyn Duddy and Jerry Bresler wrote super songs and dance numbers, and even Mr G did not hesitate to sing out. It's sad that the cast, the orchestra members, and most of the dancers could not have seen and enjoyed these tapes. The color values are great, the sound is good, and what memories!!

You probably actually watched the full color weekly broadcasts (""from Miami Beach, the fun and sun capital of the world"")that comprise this collection.  From the camera racing over the water towards the Miami Beach skyline, through the fun Broadway style musical production numbers to the closing Curtain Calls (Jackie's voice getting louder with each cast member called, ""Sheila MacCrae!

2545912,4,B000EXZFR6,"As the story goes, the New York to Florida relocation of the '60s Jackie Gleason Show was fun in the beginning (1964), but then the excitement seemed to dissipate in predictability - it's presumed that the fans who followed Jackie from the Dumont days still loved all the characters - but there was one very conspicuous by his absence - Ralph Kramden. This character was nowhere to be found on Gleason's 1959 show with Buddy Hackett, and on his 1963 to 1965 shows.

On Jaunary 8th, 1966 they did their last B & W Honeymooners, an hour special with music; and Art Carney, Audrey Meadows, and Jane Kean. (Jane was fine, but what a shame Joyce Randolph didn't make the trip down South). Apparently, that was a huge hit, so now it was time to bring 'em back (with Sheila MacCrae and Jane Kean as the wives). Also brought back were the original 1950s scripts, with some modifications).

The main difference between the 1954/1957 versions is ""color"". I believe most fans would have purchased these '50s versions - the players *look* more like their ""Classic 39"" counterparts. (I was lucky enough to attend viewings of some of these original shows at the Museum Of Broadcasting in NY around 1985).

Too bad that the 1957 shows were not also filmed/videod in color, too. Well, c'est la vie. (Ralph might say, SEST LA VYE). So let's sit back and enjoy these very rare programs.

All have great production numbers, costuming, sets. The scripts are strong; the acting - it goes without saying. Ten years passed and they didn't miss a beat. (It seemed that their timing was a bit off in the first of the remakes, though).

The matured and weightier (*sorry, Great One*) Jackie and Art get to show their versatility through the shows; it's not exactly the pair you've seen from the mid-50s though, so a way of appreciating the proceedings is to treat it as Gleason and Carney on Broadway, so to speak, more than the Honeymooners sing.

The Trip to London has some business reminiscent of the ""Chef of the Future"" episode; not as funny, but still funny.

Unfortunately, there's a heavy reliance on vaudeville stuff: ghosts in a castle, guys in gorilla suits in a very tired and dated safari sketch. Its as much Abbott and Costello as Gleason and Carney, and that's a little depressing, although A & C still work for me.

Another drawback is the somewhat ""theatrical"" feel to the shows - the actors appear to berequired to boom out their voices as if playing to a huge auditorium. The ""Classic 39"" was also done ""live"" but for whatever technical reason were able to deliver the dialogue softly at times.

Let's hope those B & W versions can be rescued from isolation - with all due respect to Sheila MacCrae and Jane Kean, the ""Classic 39"" troupe looks funnier in the French Bastile!",1166832000,3,2768,4.644171779141105
