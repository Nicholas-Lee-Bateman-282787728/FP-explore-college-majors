2001540,5,B0001HAHNM,"Words cannot describe my loss for words behind watching the late Richard Harris's portrayal of the Apostle John in the APocalypse. Considering that John is my favorite Disciple/Apostle and New Testament writer, and considering the fact that there are not many films out there that have attempted to portray life in 90 A.D. for Christians under the rule of the Emperor Domitian,during John's exile on Patmos and his writing of the Revelation(the only other such work is St. John in Exile, a live, one-man performance by Dean Martin), to visualize for the 1st time what I've only been able to read for years in the Bible and other historic accounts took my breath away. As far as the details are concerned, I'll only say ditto to the most recent online reviews and will go on to say that it's the 1st movie since the Passion to have me in tears from start to finish as Richard Harris, in my opinion, captured the Apostle's character, zeal, and passion for Christ. A masterpiece and a superb companion to the Passion of the Christ and/or the Gospel of John.",1105747200,71,1054,4.672043010752688
2001541,5,B0001HAHNM,"Set in 90 AD, this film gives us insight into the lives of Christians who lived under the domination of Roman rule. Emperor Domitian (played with ample dementia by Bruce Payne) is in power, and his goal is to kill every living Christian who does not denounce God and give allegiance to Domitian alone, who has claimed himself god over all things.
The imagery in this film is fantastic; Giovanni Galasso's cinematography is full of rich color, and a feast for the eyes; there are portions that are like liquid works of art, and I never tire of watching them, in fact, several viewings are needed to fully appreciate the creative magic of the photography. The brilliance of the palette reminds me of the heyday of Technicolor, with its opulent reds, greens and blues.

The great Richard Harris is the apostle John, and it is one of his last appearances on film. Harris, who was so terrific starring in the cable television Bible Series production of ""Abraham"" in 1994, has less to do in this film, but with his weathered face and fabulous voice is wonderful. The attractive cast that surrounds him is excellent, with Vittoria Belvedere, Benjamin Sadler and Ian Duncan in the leads. Christian Kohlund is also impressive as Quintus Maximus.
The lavish sets and authentic looking costumes lend credibility to a film that is largely about John's visions,  and are a good contrast to the ""New heaven and new earth"" of the beautiful, light-filled revelations given to the apostle.

Kudos to director Raffaele Mertes who directs with the eye of an artist (he was cinematographer for seven of the other Bible Series productions and director for ""Esther""), and another great talent from the same series of films is the award-winning composer Monsignor Marco Frisina, who for this production was also Biblical Consultant, as well as giving us an atmospheric, lovely soundtrack.
Total running time is 96 minutes, for this marvelous telling of the apostle John's final days on the island of Patmos.",1089590400,147,1984,4.916417910447761
2001542,5,B0001HAHNM,"I really liked this movie because it shows what the believers who received the book of Revelation were going through when the messages and visions of Revelation were given to them. These believers try to maintain their faith in Christ when Emperor Domitian proclaims himself to be God and gives an ultimatum for Christians to worship him or die. The believers in Ephesus send one of their female members to seek out John (played by Richard Harris) at the island of Patmos to receive messages from God and to bring them back to the church. John receives several visions which comfort the believers.  You will see truncated visions from the book of Revelation (the Lamb opening the scroll, the seven seals, the great multitude, the seven trumpet blasts, and the woman fleeing from the dragon), with a little bit of explanation thrown with it.
Don't expect a full-blown picture of the Apocalypse, but for what it is, a historical fictionalized account of what the believers were going through when Revelation is written to them, it is really good.  Richard Harris does a great job of portraying the apostle John.  If you like Richard Harris, you'll also enjoy his portrayal of Abraham in the Bible collection series (which this movie is a part of). It is comforting, thought-provoking, and faithful for the most part to the Bible.",1087344000,99,1327,4.8628318584070795
2001543,5,B0001HAHNM,"To be honest, I'm not a devout church goer or any of that, though I do believe in God and a higher power...  Now that that is out of the way, I really enjoyed this film, what a blissful feeling it leaves you with at its end!  Richard Harris plays the Apostle John in his last days, when he wrote ""Revelations.""  Any Christian faith will appreciate this excellent film!  I can't recall all of the actors, but noticed some who have been in very noticeable films and the acting was for the most part very spectacular...  To me and a lot of you out there, ""Revelations"" is very interesting and mysterious at the same time and this film really does it justice; throughout the movie you see John's revelations as he sees them (in the movie) and they have done a great job here.  This film would make the Apostle John proud and Jesus (God), very well put together.  I'd like to see more movies like this, all of the cliche' Hollywood jive gets old and sometimes leaves you blue, but not this film, I reccomend this film 110 percent!  Hope you all enjoy it and all the best...",1084406400,9,1068,4.331658291457287
2001544,5,B0001HAHNM,I saw it on the christian channel and i love it and i think it has a great message about what will happen in the years to come and i  belive that is one of the finest perfomance by his royal actor name  mr.

2001608,2,B0001HAHNM,"I'm not a movie reviewer, but I am a Christian.  When John (Richard Harris) told his young protege, ""Your sins are forgiven."" with the obvious indication that he could forgive sins, then that smacks of heresy because only God can forgive sins.  Additiionally, there is so much that can be done with this subject of John at the Isle of Patmos.  They didn't develop the plot or the characters or anything else.  I didn't like that at all.",1508198400,,436,4.551282051282051

Well played by Irish actor Richard Harris in his final film role.",1506643200,,283,4.2592592592592595
2001624,3,B0001HAHNM,"Overall good movie, but a little too much on Hollywood drama.  The Apostle John wrote the Revelation of Jesus Christ from the Isle of Patmos while caught up in the Spirit on the Lord's Day.  This movie takes a little too much liberty and tries to portray John more as a muse and the believers of the Seven Churches as rebels.  Still a good movie to sit back and enjoy on  a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1506384000,,396,4.24
2001625,4,B0001HAHNM,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2000 and directed by Raffaele Mertes, The Apocalypse chronicles events during the reign of Roman Emperor Domitian (Bruce Payne) circa 90 AD when the elderly apostle John (Richard Harris) is imprisoned on the island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea (off the coast of modern day Turkey). John experiences strange visions, as detailed in the book of Revelation. Christian Kohlund plays a formidable Roman commander ordered to kill Christians in Asia Minor while Vittoria Belvedere plays a devout believer in love with a duplicitous man who is sent to the penal colony on Patmos as a Roman spy (Benjamin Sadler).

Any film that attempts to tackle the biblical book of Revelation is ambitious, to say the least, and The Apocalypse should be respected for this, particularly since its a surprisingly quality period movie, which doesnt forget to be entertaining while conveying worthy mind/spirit food. Being made in 1999 and limited by a TV budget, I was expecting lousy sets, costuming, locations and, especially, bad CGI effects. But, thankfully, the movie delivers in all these areas. The F/X hold up surprisingly well, all things considered, and they helped me better visualize Johns visions in Revelation, which heretofore I had only seen in my mind. Speaking of which, to appreciate this movie it helps to be a little familiar with the book of Revelation, otherwise you might be lost, especially since the movies plot is a tad convoluted.

Interestingly, in one of his apocalyptic visions John sees the twin towers of the World Trade Center burning, which of course came to pass in real life a mere year after the films initial release!

THE MOVIE RUNS 96 minutes and was shot (at least in part) in Morocco (I cant find any other info on the locations). WRITER: Francesco Contaldo.

2001647,2,B0001HAHNM,"Besides the accuracy issues as noted in other reviews, this has a heavy emphasis on misery and suffering that is simply not how the early Christians would have handled life, much less persecution. Would John, who had witnessed not only the death but also the resurrection of Christ in the flesh, still be so absorbed with His death? This is the mark of religiosity, not faith in the living Christ with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit accompanied by signs and wonders as was true in that day, more true than now, though it should be just as powerful today.

I also wish the bar at the bottom were present, allowing one to find one's place in the movie. Where did that go?

2001681,1,B0001HAHNM,"I don't recall ever having written a review of a movie before.  But I had to do so after painfully watching this film.  Simply put, this film is unBiblical and in error in every attempt to appear that it is in accord with Scripture.  Biblical passages included in the script are never in their proper context, and many times were actually edited or rewritten.  There is only one book in the Bible that includes a vivid and sober warning not to ""add"" or ""take away"" from its text.  That book is the Revelation of Jesus Christ.  The very book that this film blatantly misrepresents.  I pray that the producers of this mistake will soon realize their error, repent, and remove this abomination from circulation.",1485216000,13,708,4.661290322580645

The depiction of the brutality by which the Early Christians were treated particularly during the reign of the brutal Domitian is exceptional and deserves praise. The depiction of the strength and the endurance of the Early Christians faith in the midst of horrendous persecution is Inspirational. The scenes in which we see St John the Evangelist interacts with the Heavenly visions concerning the Churches of Asia Minor that he later penned down under the inspiration of The Holy Spirit in the book of Revelation, are exceptional and mesmerizing. I hope they would produce many Great Biblical Movies like this charming one.",1474675200,,912,5.006578947368421
2001769,1,B0001HAHNM,"OK lets begin by saying that John of Patmos was not according to historians the John from the apostles. The visions shown not what I would have expected.  Acting was good but the lead female a red head with blue eyes not historically likely for the part and why didn't they use Nero who was possibly the reference to 666. I just found too many things in the movie I couldn't suspend disbelief for, when it was supposed to be a story of John of Patmos the writer of Revelations.",1474502400,,477,4.3

This movie illustrates the seven seals found in the Book of Revelations written by John the Apostle while he was imprisoned on the island of Patmos. What love this great saint had for God and his fellow man.  John personally knew Jesus, and we feel this bond.  The early Christians went through a brutal world, but they are all in heaven.

It weaves Roman history, as well as a fictional relationship account, around the Apostle John around 90 AD, while at the same time John is having the visions which ultimately make up the Book of Revelations.  The visions are true to the Biblical account, and there is no attempt to interpret them, but the challenges of the Christian church against a world that's against them is very well portrayed.  True to the Bible, mixed in with a background story, it's great to see that movies like this can still be made.",1472428800,4,541,4.614583333333333

It gave me an understanding of the conditions St. John the Apostle was existing in, while he was being inspired to write the letters, which made up the book of Revelation.

2001831,2,B0001HAHNM,"First, let me say that Richard Harris was one of my favorite actors, and his portrayal of John was excellent. Technically, the film is not adapted to HD TV. Many places in the film were grainy or very blotchy. Now, my real issue....I am a Christian and read my bible all the time. I am very familiar with all parts of the Book of Revelation. The screen writers took great liberties with the word of God here. They changed virtually everything to fit with a fictitious storyline based loosely on sacred scripture, depicting the opening of the seventh seal to represent John's vision itself, and an abrupt end of Christian persecution in 90AD when John died. That would be news indeed, to the centuries of Christians who were tortured horrifically and burned at the stake by Romans for hundreds of years! I like a good story, but don't mess with the Word of God.",1466208000,19,860,4.590909090909091

2001879,3,B0001HAHNM,I had the DVD before. I actually like the movie because I like John's visions of Heaven. It's very difficult to take the Book of Revelation and try to use the right special effects to make it realistic. I would have given it more stars if the special effects would have been better. The storyline was pretty good. Then again I like these kinds of movies. I think Richard Harris as old as he was when he made this movie did an okay job playing the part of John. I'd like to see it remade with better special effects but it pretty much stuck to what John wrote about in Revelation as to what he saw in heaven.,1463443200,3,607,4.1525423728813555

His communion with Jesus & the revelations he received are something I long for. I found myself communing with my Lord as he was during various parts of the movie. It truly stirred my heart. Also his ability to suffer for Jesus and yet not complain & indeed love & serve instead was inspiring. A man surrendered to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

2002031,2,B0001HAHNM,"This was pretty awful.  Not even Richard Harris, who was an incredible actor, could save this train wreck of a film.  The story was absolutely incoherent, I couldn't care at all for any of the characters, and the acting apart from Harris was abyssal.  Domitian hamming up his lord emperor role was cringeworthy, but not as cringeworthy as the scenes intended to be emotional.

As for the Revelation scenes, some of them benefited from some interesting editing, but on the whole the portrayals of John's vision were both unimaginative and far too abstract to be a helpful visual aid to the Book of Revelation, which is in fact steeped in Old Testament  symbol and imagery.  The beasts of Revelation are nowhere to be seen.  And neither is the false bride Harlot.  The number of the beast is not even mentioned, which will disappoint many, though I personally don't consider that a huge feature of the book.  The absolutely critical literary structure of Revelation is butchered, which is part of what makes it feel impressionistic rather than a coherent prophecy.  Most of the Old Testament imagery is completely missed or obscured.

The film places the vision in A.D.90 during the reign of Domitian, which I believe to be more than 20 years too late in history.  The significance is that pre-AD70, much of the vision would be speaking of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.  But I realize that AD90 is the majority modern position, I don't fault the film for that.

So I give the film two stars for Richard Harris's always-good performance and for a couple interesting interpretations of the visions (e.g. Christ among the lampstands, though they are candlesticks in the film where they possibly should be menorahs; the saints before the altar at the Temple; and the . . . oh, I guess that's it).",1448496000,8,1804,4.796116504854369

2002057,5,B0001HAHNM,Using this to movie to help with the study of the book of Revelation. It helps students understand the struggle the Christians had at the time of writing the Revelation.  I would rate this video as 9 on a scale of 10.,1445299200,,217,4.166666666666667
2002058,2,B0001HAHNM,"If you're going to take on the magnificent, even trippy-looking book of Revelation, you're going to have to figure out a way of handling the visions that make up almost the entirety of the book. Cheapo Pier One candlesticks for the awesome seven lampstands of the Seven Churches? (Candles were apparently the major budget item. Where are the oil lamps that would have been used?) Bad CGI (shudder). The movie failed to awe: perhaps out was the made-for-TV movie it looked like. I cringed.

Domitian's (the god-Caesar) acting made William Shatner look like a study in reserve and subtlety. Was this Richard Harris' last movie? He was fine as a very old man, St. John. Which one would expect from a very old man.

I hate to fault a religious movie, but in this case, the subject far exceeded the makers' grasp.",1444867200,,808,4.683098591549296

For example, when  Theofulis (sp?) asked John for more information about Jesus, he  described the gruesome sight of Jesus on the cross bleeding from his hands and then he said from his side. After that, he described how Jesus asked John to take care of his mother Mary. Jesus's side was pierced with a sword by a Roman soldier after Jesus was dead. Water and blood flowed from his side. You really need some familiariy with the book of ACTS to follow.

The problem of course is that Jesus' side was not opened until after the Romans came to break His legs; and noticed that He was already dead. There are several such inconsistencies in this movie.

2002230,5,B0001HAHNM,"The Book of Revelation / Apocalypse is notoriously difficult to understand.  Although the visions therein are difficult to capture in a film, in this version, Richard Harris wonderfully portrays the visionary as a credible, flesh and blood person.  More generally, the movie provides a historical context that helps the viewer understand the events that inspired the Book, including the persecutions that Christians were suffering under the Romans at the time.  Although some of the visionary scenes are not as well done as others, I must give the creators of this movie credit for tackling very difficult material and for bringing in someone of Richard Harris's stature to pull off the role of John.  For Christians, the movie puts us in touch with those who have gone before us in faith and calls us to have strength and perseverance as well.",1434412800,,844,5.007142857142857

2002251,5,B0001HAHNM,"The apocalypse or book of revelation is a very difficult book to read and understand. The video was well done and really only gives a small glimpse into the book. The film deals with St John and the trials and difficulties of the early church. Yes there were roman tyrants that truly tried to destroy the early church and Many suffered greatly. I think the film mostly shows reflections on St John and the early church. Yes there are visions and images that they try to put into the film and they do a good job at it.... But in no way is it representative of the full  Book of revelation.

But the acting is good, the plot is interesting and one gains insight into St John and the early church. A good watch.",1433030400,,708,4.276119402985074

This role is one that surprised me as he played so many hard, tough, and demanding characters.  A unique departure for him and yet in some ways his best, though obviously Hollywood, being secularized to the max, isn't likely to award him for it!

Caution: If you a looking for a Biblically accurate account unmarked by side stories of an author's inagination, you will not like this.  Still, there is much to like here, even though.

Some of the characters are historical characters, some are fictional.  It works.  I could enjoy this movie for what it was.  4 stars.",1430956800,,525,4.6923076923076925

2002293,5,B0001HAHNM,"Richard Harris, as always, gave a stunning performance in this movie.  It portrayed the Apostle John's life in captivity when he was visited by Jesus and instructed to record what he was allowed to see first hand, (His writings in the Book of Revelations).  We are given glimpses of some of the things Jesus showed him, which left me wanting to see more! (However for anyone who does want to get an excellent in-depth view of the Apostle John's writings in the Book of Revelations, I recommend the book by Dr. Henry Morris, the Revelation Record).  As for biblical accuracy, it stayed true to what we know from the Bible and did a great job filling in where we can only imagine his life in this prison.",1429315200,7,702,4.511811023622047

In 90 A.D., the Roman emperor launches a fierce campaign against the Christians, and John is being held captive for his efforts to spread the gospel. When a young Christian named Irene arrives with hopes of visiting the last surviving witness of the Lord's passion, John entrusts her with a written record of his divine visions that will eventually form the Book of Revelations.

This is an excellent TV movie about John the Apostle and it gives the viewer more insight about the Book Of Revelations.

It came along just as I was studying John, the Beloved Apostle, so that was kind of magical.  The story line didn't really fit with anything biblical that I am studying, but it's a glance at it, in picture not only processed in one's mind.  And, who but Richard Harris could do this film justice, AND this character?  Nobody I can think of.  This film is very well done, imo.  Thank you.",1392249600,,638,4.330508474576271

2002362,5,B0001HAHNM,Great movie and wonderful acting. Is it just me because I am an eye surgeon but did anyone else notice what surely looked like a basal cell carcinoma nasal to the medial canthus of Richard Harris's left eye. I was very very distracting.

I was not disappointed in the least.  My wife showed me in her Bible where John's life was told, and it was very close to what was in this movie.

Before watching this movie I had not given much thought to Richard Harris' career.  But now I have a new respect for the fact that he would give Christian film an honest showing.  The love he portrays in this movie that followers of Christ are called to show says it all.  He and the film makers, and other casts did great in this area.",1372464000,,655,4.0703125

2002380,4,B0001HAHNM,I am not sure though if John was really alone at Potmos as this movie shows that he was with other prisoners. Nonetheless it's the only Dvd that show John at Potmos I returned the other John play type because the children simply cannot stand looking at a DVD with only one setting and one face. This may not be biblically accurate but I am keeping it because it shows John's life at Potmos and death at Ephesus.,1371168000,,411,4.282051282051282

2002401,5,B0001HAHNM,"One of my pastor friends let me show this film during the hours when the congregation was relaxing after service ended.  The film gives a good basic telling of John's view of Revelation.  It also gets to include a side story of the original persecutions Christian disciples faced in Rome.

To date this is perhaps one of very few movies that really goes out of it's way to illustrate the Revelation of John on movie film.  Although the special effects might not be the equal of The Passion, it does get it's idea across.

Since it isn't as graphic in depiction as The Passion, it will be an easier view by younger audiences as well as any Christians growing in the faith.",1334016000,,671,4.467213114754099

I've enjoyed Mr. Harris' works since This Sporting Life.  Regardless all his excesses he was a man of faith, a Knight of Malta in the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.  This movie is a wonderful way for him to conclude his long career. It was meant to be. I'm sure he felt it. His full name is Richard St. John Harris.

I have always cherished this particular movie as it has Richard Harris as the lead character, the Apostle John.  He is outstanding and utterly convincing in this role, particularly when our focus shifts from his tortured, imprisoned life, to the actual ""revelation"" or revealing, of the things which must take place in the future - which is soon to happen - meaning in our immediate future. Bible scholars and those who read the bible know that where Genesis marks the beginning of time, as we know it, the book of Revelation marks the ""end"" of things on this earth and the understanding (if you study it..) of where you will end up and why.
I recommend this to all fans of Richard Harris.  And especially if you want to grasp more knowledge into the book of Revelation.  You owe yourself this sneak peak into the spritual vision that John the Apostle embraced and wrote (for us in these end of days...).",1291161600,,1158,4.584541062801932
2002407,4,B0001HAHNM,"This is the story of the last few years of John the Apostle's life, the last of the apostles who walked with Jesus. The film starts out by setting the stage - how the Roman Caesar saw himself, as a god. And as such he goes on a rampage to eliminate the 'competition', and in particular he is very concerned about the status of John and rumours being spread about this apostle.

The film unfolds at two levels simultaneously: Firstly there is the natural level where John is a prisoner on the Isle of Patmos and the believers are desperate to communicate with him. Secondly there is the spiritual level, where at nights John is transported to heaven and other various locations to receive messages from the Lord.

John then dictates these messages to his fellow scribe, the parchments are then sent out to the Christians when supplies come into the prison. Ultimately, it is the collection of these prachments that will constitite the Book of Revelation. The vistual interpretations of heaven and what takes place as the 7 seals are each broken is turn are well portrayed.

What this picture captures very beautifully is the humility and love that the apostle expresses in the face of his cruel captors. He demonstrates by his life what it really means to be a Christian. Such values have been lost in the church today. Richard Harris does an excellent job.

The entire book of Revelation is not captured in the film; however Jesus is seen in his full glory ... with his face only shown as a bright shining light ... this is a nice touch. For Bible lovers, this is a collector's piece.",1287100800,3,1584,4.6063829787234045

2002424,5,B0001HAHNM,"As a Christian, it's really hard to find good movies to watch. There are just way too many movies nowadays that glorify lifestyles and actions that simply shouldn't be glorified.

When I stumbled across this movie, I decided to watch it because I had already read the book of Revelations. This movie sounded interesting, and so I gave it a try.

This movie tells the story of the last years of John the Apostle. John was the youngest of Jesus's disciples and the only one who wasn't martyred. John is also the only one who lived to a very old age (He didn't die until he was in his 90s).

Most of the story takes place on the Island of Patmos where John lived out his last days in exile. During this time he gets the visions he writes about in the book of Revelations.

What I liked so much about this movie, other than Richard Harris as John who is a very fine actor, is the very human face it puts on the events in the Bible. Many people don't want to believe that the Bible is true. Instead, they want to believe that it is a book of myths and fairy tales even though much modern scholarship has proven much of the Bible to be historically accurate.

There are many scenes in this movie that will bring tears to your eyes, especially if you are a Christian. When John gives his food to another prisoner to replace what a guard had thrown out, it's deeply moving to see the compassion of someone who has so little materially and yet has everything spiritually.

The whole experience really deepened my faith and softened my heart to want to be more compassionate to other people. It brought into perspective the lessons Jesus was trying to teach us. It really doesn't matter what the world thinks about you. What's important is how God sees you and your relationship with Him.

Although the Biblical references to the Book of Revelations, John's visions, are hard to understand unless you've studied Revelations, they are still visually appealing, and will arouse your curiousity about what Revelations really says.

This is both a very spiritually and emotionally appealing movie that accurately follows both what the Bible teaches and what history says about the persecutions of Christians at this time, as well as the incarceration of John.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a movie that will touch your heart and make you think.",1240963200,6,2351,4.591885441527446

2002446,1,B0001HAHNM,"""The Apocalypse"" (2002) stars Richard Harris as John, and depicts portions of the Book of Revelation, framed by the story of John on Patmos and a fictional love/spy story.

The visuals of the heavenly scenes are striking--but the movie must come under the book's curse, ""if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and ut of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."" For the director, Raffaele Mertes, took away a lot--chapters 13-20--with just a nod in the direction of the final two chapters. Thus the climax is the birth of the child in chapter 12, which is assumed to be the final victory; John's vision of the holy city comes on his death bed.

2002449,3,B0001HAHNM,"TNT hit a home run with their BIBLE COLLECTION, based exclusively on the Old Testament. This was their first attempt at a New Testament book, the Revelation of John. That is a tough one to attempt the first time out but I can imagine while it would be appealing. There is much imagery that would be a natural for the screen. This film, however, falls short of that.

The early church is facing a time of persectution. That is the official policy of the Roman Empire. People of faith are worried and are encouraged on receiving letters from John, one of the original 12 disciples. John himself is in hiding, in a Roman prison. The story is one of keeping the faith in the face of sever hardships.

2002463,4,B0001HAHNM,"Folks, The Apocalypse is a retelling of the book of Revelation as received by the Apostle John, produced by Italian Radio TV. It is a very Catholic movie, as most of the consultants were Catholic and at least one Orthodox and it shows. But it is not blatantly Catholic, so basically any Christian will enjoy watching the movie.

You all know Richard Harris. His filmography is quite extensive and includes The Guns of Navarone (1961), The Bible (1966) titled The Bible... In the Beginning (in USA) & La Bibbia (in Italy), A Man Called Horse (1970), and two Harry Potter movies. The Apocalypse is his last movie and he delivers a powerful performance as John the Apostle. There's something about his raspy voice, which sounds old yet vital, imbued with authority and compassion that moves the viewer to listen carefully. All his actions seemed to very deliberate but not forced, very natural, without conceit. What an actor!

Actors Vittoria Belvedere and Benjamin Sadler play ""Irene"" and ""Valerius"" respectively, in a supporting role. Theirs is the ""mandatory love affair"" that we often see in these kinds of movie, but I assure that this affair is not vulgar, nor does it eclipse the plot. Irene had met the Apostle John when she was younger and now she's sent by the Bishop of Ephesus to track the Apostle in order to ensure the authenticity of the Apocalypse. Valerius is a Roman officer whose parents were Christians, having been adopted by a Roman general. He infiltrates the Ephesian Church, his mission being to locate the Apostle John, but he has second thoughts and...well, watch the movie.

The movie's strong points lie on its special effects. They carry the story well, without overwhelming it. John tells the story, and you see what he sees. Although the director-Rafaelle Mertes-threaded some current events into the movie to illustrate its prophetic aspects-including scenes from 9-11 to picture ""war""-he does it without forcing the biblical text into modern fulfillments. What the director achieves is a correspondence of ideas. This is no ""rapture"" movie a la Left Behind..

The Apocalypse is a part of the The Bible Collection produced by Italian Radio-Television. This is the kind of movie that we must support. I hope you watch it",1147478400,41,2250,4.960212201591512

2002469,2,B0001HAHNM,"I have always been fascinated by the story of St. John, Jesus' beloved disciple who managed to outlive his contemporaries only to suffer exile on the island of Patmos, so I was understandably thrilled to discover that there was a movie made about the last years of his life. Unfortunately, this film doesn't do justice to this pillar of the church and to the legends that have proliferated about him throughout the centuries.

John the Apostle, ""the disciple whom Jesus loved,"" was made guardian of Mary, the mother of Christ. After she died, he allegedly preached in Parthia and areas of Asia Minor, settling with St. Timothy in Ephesus after the deaths of Peter and Paul. Here is where the story gets interesting. When he was an elderly man, about 89 or 90 years old and peacefully living out the end of his life in Ephesus, John was summoned to Rome to stand trial before the emperor Domitian, a violent sociopath who wanted nothing more than to eliminate the followers of Christianity. According to legend, Domitian had John beaten, tortured, and thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil from which he escaped unscathed. Domitian also ordered John to drink poison, which he did happily, thereby fulfilling Christ's prophecy that he also would drink of Christ's cup. Again John remained unharmed. Fearing that John was a sorcerer, Domitian banished him to the island of Patmos where he wrote the Book of Revelation. After Domitian's death he returned to Ephesus, raised a friend from the dead, wrote his Gospel, and died around the year 100.

Fascinating stuff, right? It has everything -- adventure, intrigue, divine intervention, unshakable faith, human suffering and triumph. I didn't think it was possible to screw up a movie about St. John, but The Apocalypse proved me wrong.

The movie opens with John already exiled on Patmos. No good reason is given for his being there except that he's hiding from Domitian, who wants to believe that John is dead and vows to kill him if he is not. Patmos is apparently some kind of jail or slave camp where criminals and outlaws are sent to dig mines and copy documents or something. Everyone's looking for John but no one can find him in spite of the fact that he doesn't seem to be hiding. Despite the invasive presence of Roman soldiers (who even build traps to keep people from escaping), a woman from Ephesus manages to walk on and off the island to pick up letters from John as if she's walking in and out of her own house. Then we've got some average plot diversions -- an anti-Christian Roman spy who discovers that his dead parents were really Christians, a bunch of murdered Christian refugees (whom we don't care about due to the lack of character development), a romantic subplot, an escape plot.

In the midst of this are John's drawn out visions of how the world is going to end. They're downright hokey. While one has to give the director credit for trying to visually depict John's opaque and sometimes disturbing prophesies, the special effects were poorly done. They looked as if they were ripped right out of The Neverending Story. The attempt to instill emotion, sincerity, and a sense of urgency into John's visions falls short, and the movie employs a fundamentalist reading of the Book of Revelation typical of the views espoused by the 700 Club and the likes of John Hagee.

The acting is good -- if your idea of good acting is that of a high school play. Someone should tell the guy who plays Domitian that screaming every other line does not a Shakespearean actor make. With the exception of Richard Harris, the other actors cry on cue, shout on cue, and look like they're trying too hard to be sincere. When Richard Harris is given a chance to act, he does so with a sweet gentleness that is never feeble or condescending, and he gives us some arresting moments. When an earnest disciple asks him to recount the story of Jesus' death, he cries and speaks as if he's tearing the words from the depths of his memory -- interesting considering that he must have told the story hundreds of times. During another moment, he has a small crisis of faith and wonders why Jesus has left his only living apostle to suffer in such backwater. However, these moments are cut short for more apocalyptic corniness. That's the central problem of The Apocalypse: the movie is concerned with everything except its most human thread: the faith and trials of John.

For the life of me, I can't understand why the director and writer wouldn't want to explore some of the captivating legends about John. The only reason I can come up with is that these legends seem far-fetched and incredible, and that depicting them might distract from John's visions of the end times. Well, I can't think of anything more far-fetched or distracting than John's having a vision of September 11th, but I guess that's just me.

So, here's to hoping that a better filmmaker sees the potential for greatness in the story of John the Apostle. With the resurgence of Christianity and the recent influx of historical and religious movies, it's surprising that a mainstream director hasn't picked up on the appeal of the legends of this incredible man.",1107820800,28,5178,4.740288568257491

The visions were all rushed through and lacked any cohesion whatsoever. There was very little to edify a Christian who has taken the time to study God's word, notably Revelation. It also appears that John blessed Didymus, and told him his sins were forgiven in the Name of Jesus. I don't believe that even an Apostle who actually walked with Jesus can do that. He can tell a person 'if you accept the Lord as your savior then The Lord will forgive your sins at that very second.' Only God can redeem the sinner. It also sounded like he was saying if you are good and love you'll be saved without mentioning that you also have to believe in Christ and accept his salvation.
