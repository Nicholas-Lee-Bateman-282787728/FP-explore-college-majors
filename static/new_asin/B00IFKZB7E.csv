8641867,5,B00IFKZB7E,"The eclecticism of the music and dance really make this production stand out, and the way the musical genres morph into one another is a bit of genius. The dancers are superlative and even the scenery gets justifiable applause. This is not a ""watch it once and store it on the shelf"" purchase. And it is, for me, better as a purchase rather than a rental.",1431648000,,355,4.393939393939394
