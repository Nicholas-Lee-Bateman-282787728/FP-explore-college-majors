8033495,5,B0002VYBQG,"If you are like so many people, like I was until 5 months ago, searching for that answer to the elusive mystery of the golf swing, your search is over if you sincerely look into what David Lee teaches. I had been studying the golf swing intensly as a hobby since 2003. I own and have studied many dozens of golf instuction books and videos. I was beginning to think that the answer could not be found in one place, and I would have to figure it all out myself. I learned enough from my research to know 10 minutes into David Lee's first tape in the series, the one covering the evolution of different swing power sources, that I had found what was missing from my understanding! In a world full of hype and where everyone is claiming to have found the ""secret"" to the perfect swing, you might tend to rightly be a little sceptical. Give this a shot, you won't be sorry. This tape series is a nice introduction to David Lee's teaching. I also highly recommend his book and his newer DVD's available by calling the phone number on his web site. He has further refined his amazingly effective drills in the DVD. I have also been to David's school and benefited immeasurably. But you don't need to go to the school to learn the physics perfect swing, the drills he has devised will teach you if you are willing to do them. I have deeply desired to be able to swing in the effortless looking manner of players such as Jack Nicklaus and Fred Couples. I can now feel this in my own body when I watch them, and can feel it in my own swing. (with my own look) When you learn to stop trying to guide the club to the ball, and trust that perfect arc you can now create by using all your body parts in proper sequence and harmony; you will be astounded at how far and accurately the ball will fly, without effort! As far as I am concerned, David Lee is the best swing researcher and teacher in the history of golf. I am now at peace with golf and the golf swing. How many can say that?",1202688000,,1973,4.20844327176781
