4962189,5,B0066E6T8G,"Okay first of this isn't an original story similar to Transformers:More than Meets the Eye, or the GoBots original story released last year by Warner Bros.. This is actually the very first five episodes of the series, I can't remember if it was an originally a mini-series similar to GI JOE and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had back in the day, but those two also had continuing story-lines going through the entire 5-episode story, where the Centurions doesn't.

As to the episodes themselves all 5 are very well made with very good stories for the 80's action series and the animation is simply beautiful.

I would highly recommend this to any fans of 80's cartoon or action cartoons in general.",1329004800,,701,4.785123966942149
4962190,4,B0066E6T8G,"OK, I have every episode of this cartoon on DVD.  They are rips from the Boomerang network and they are almost near perfect in quality.  You can find the whole series on the net to burn.  This was one of my favorite cartoons as a child.  So why did I buy this?  I like to have originals.  My question is, ""Why do we only get 5 episodes when there are 65 episodes in total.""  What's the deal here?  I bought this because I want the whole series released by Warner Archive.  What is Warner Archive thinking by not giving us at least a 35 episode set?  These DVD-R's are made on demand.  These are bare bones sets so why make us buy this trickle set?  Stop trying to get  us to shell out more money.  I thought that was the whole reason for the Warner Archive sets?  Warner Bros. is making a killing off of us with this.  They did the same thing with The GOBOTS.  Stop, just stop it Warner Bros.  You have all the episodes and they are made on demand so nothing is wasted.  It's all profit for you.  GIVE US THE SERIES TO BUY PLEASE!!!!

I watched this set and the five episodes look fantastic on my HD TV.  The picture is very sharp.  It looks way better than my burned copies but they took out the educational parts at the end of each episode.  Why would you do that?  C'mon Warner Archive, give the fans what they want.  I bought this but I will not buy another episode of Centurions if it's not season sets or at least split into 4 sets.  My burned copies will work for me.  Warner Bros., you did it with Silver Hawks why not Centurions and the GOBOTS?  This set gets 4 stars for content.  You lose a star for not including the educational scene at the end of each episode.

SEASON SETS!!!!!!  Warner Archive.  SEASON SETS!!!!!!!",1328054400,58,1730,4.192660550458716

8493936,4,B0066E6T8G,"I loved this series as a kid.. When i purchased this, I didn't realize it would be just the few episodes it took for them to make a ""mini-series"" that they started the show with.... hmmmm.... shady.. anyway, there are 60 or so episodes still out there somewhere and they give us a few... couldve been less expensive. I would've been half happy with 15 or more episodes from first season or something... 5 stars tho for the actual series, 4 stars for this one whopping disc...",1437177600,,475,4.471264367816092
