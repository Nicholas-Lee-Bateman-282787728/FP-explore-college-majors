Thomas & Friends: Holiday Favorites
(Hit Entertainment, 2011)
-------------------------------------------------------
Big holiday fun for younger, preschool-age viewers who are enraptured by Thomas The Tank Engine and his pals.  This 3-DVD set includes three holiday-themed collections: ""Merry Winter Wish"" (2010), ""Ultimate Christmas"" (2007) and ""Holiday Express"" (2009) which were previously issued as separate discs. It's a huge load of yuletide joy, but if anyone can haul it to your door, Thomas can! (ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1319155200,4,602,7.026666666666666
