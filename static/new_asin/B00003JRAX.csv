7919320,4,B00003JRAX,"As an avid Tom and Jerry fan since childhood, ""Festival of Fun"" was a good addition to my collection. Especially fun were ""Touche' Pussy Cat,"" which might be one of the best Tom and Jerry episodes, ""The Truce Hurts"" and ""Little Quacker."" I was somewhat disappointed with the other three episodes selected knowing that there were much better ones which could have been included. ""Blue Cat Blues"" was very well done and well written, but actually depressing for a Tom and Jerry cartoon. While ""Sufferin' Cats,"" and ""Tennis Chums"" have funny parts, there is little conflict or story in them. Although the episode selection could have been better, ""Festival of Fun"" is a nice addition for any Tom and Jerry fan.",1041984000,10,707,4.851239669421488
7919321,5,B00003JRAX,"As an avid cartoon fanatic, I have been disappointed by the cartoons' downward spiral since the mid to late 50s. These are the last stand against boring cartoons. So I'm 23 and I watch cartoons! Kids just can't fully appreciate the classics.
Get this tape to see what real cartoons were before Scooby Doo and the Flinstones made us ashamed to like cartoons by Hanna/Barbera.
From an artist and a cartoon fan, these are the seminal works of artists that followed Elvis' demise... the early works were the greatest, after that, we all hung or heads in shame. Leering and laughing and the bulbous sideburned mass doing Karate moves in a rhine stone jump suit.
A perfect 5 from me! Refuse and resist anything but the classics.",983145600,7,722,4.692913385826771
