Especially worth attention are the Five Benedictions including one stating ""I bow to those who live what they teach.""",1347062400,,252,5.461538461538462
8373300,2,B002LVVEP6,"Filmed at the height of the free love era, this film does not give any authenticity to Jainism, which is unfortunate. It makes it look like a joke and a cult like Jonestown. Jainism is a 3000 yr old religion that practices ahimsa, non-violence. I don't practice Ahimsa so I wanted to smack these people.",1302739200,,303,4.527272727272727
