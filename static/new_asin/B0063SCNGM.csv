8492265,5,B0063SCNGM,"Stop being mad about the fact you cannot watch it in your DVD player and taking it out on the Seller, it is in the title that it is not in USA format but in UK which is region 2, if you want to watch it here in the US you need to get the Region 1 which is USA/Canada. I'm not trying to be rude but I've had this happen to me before and didn't know what the regions were, I learned to check those details before i even put the item in a wish list or buy it.",1381276800,5,456,3.57
8492266,5,B0063SCNGM,"I see that a lot of people who made a comment cannot read or understand that this item is a UNITED KINGDOM version, region code 2. The item clearly states this, & it seems people are to lazy or just don't understand what they are reading. Here is some more information, made as easy to understand as Possible.

REGION CODES prevent Movies from 1 country being played in another country with a different Region Code. Region Codes go from 1 to 8 USA is Region 1. Standard US DVD players will only play Region 1 & Region Free DVDS. You'll need to purchase a Region Free DVD player in order to play a DVD. You can find Region Free DVD players online for about $50+. With a Region Free DVD Player, you will be able to play all DVD Movies, so you don't end up looking like Bad Parents who can't understand technology.

Here is a Region Free DVD Player on Amazon for your Movie Needs.

8492267,4,B0063SCNGM,"The issue was resolved between myself and the seller, THANK YOU SELLER FOR MY FULL REFUND.....I will never order here again.  I ordered these movies form DAAVEEDEE and got them yesterday, I asked to return the same day because the DVD's would not work in my Blue Ray Player or my DVD player. This is what the seller told me. ""Hello, It looks like you may have mistakenly missed the title, product details, product description, and seller's comments for this item - there were several warnings about it being an import and about it's NON-USA format - you can read them all by going to your Amazon account and checking your recent orders. Here is what you will see: Then they listed a lot of warning they say are on the page, which are not... I am very displeased with this seller and would not recommend them to anyone. They are trying to take 20% of my money for restocking fees and I feel if they know their product doesn't work in the United States, they should not sale it in the United States, I am going to the better Business Bureau and I will be filling charges, I am a Memphis Police Officer and I do know my rights. This will not be the last that this seller hears from me.",1376092800,2,1182,4.324324324324325
8492268,1,B0063SCNGM,"Was really looking forward to this for my son. Wont work on any player. Keeps giving a ""Not Available in This Region"" code.",1373846400,2,123,4.391304347826087
8492269,1,B0063SCNGM,"I ordered this item as a gift for my daughter. Was really excited to find it. It arrived and I saved it for a year to give her birthday. When I gave to her she was very excited, but then she went to watch them.....and it said wrong region. So, I spent fifty dollars on a gift that we could not even watch, and to late for refund. I wrote the company I purchased it from, but no response.",1372636800,4,387,3.911392405063291
8492270,1,B0063SCNGM,"DVD's would not play on my DVD player they are meant for other countries - I ordered them to watch with my granddaughters - we were heartbroken when we wanted to watch them and realized that they wouldn't play.  The seller did allow me to return them I hope I get a credit on my credit card.  It would seem that a seller shipping an item that won't play on DVD's in the United States to an address in New York State would contact the purchaser and let them know that the DVD's were for another ""region""  - who knew there were different regions - it certainly wasn't obvious when it was ordered.",1362528000,11,594,4.238938053097345
8492271,1,B0063SCNGM,Really diappointed that we couldn't watch these on Christmas day.  Even more disappointed that you apparently can't get a box set that plays in the US!  What the heck??,1360368000,7,168,4.758620689655173
