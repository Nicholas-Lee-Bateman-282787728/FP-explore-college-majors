Although the historical information is available in other places, whats beautiful and unique here is how many of the great Jamaican singer-songwriters are given a chance to talk firsthand about their Rasta beliefs. It gives the viewer who already knows the music a little window into the hearts of Joseph Hill (of Culture), Ijahman Levi, and many others. You can feel what their worldview means to them personally and how its informed their actions in music.

Im not sure what this movie would be like for someone who doesnt already know the music. There are might be other books/movies that would form an easier introduction to the culture and language  although the exposition of the facts in this movie is very well done.

This movie is *not* a place to come if you want to see a lot of musical performancesthat isn't its purposebut the soundtrack in the background is great.

Highly recommended.",1527897600,,1027,4.779661016949152
