330892,5,6301325397,"This film is very good because it is very unusual. A lot of the film is in Japanese with subtitles but because of the action and suspense, viewers will not find the language distracting and subtitles. There is much full-body nudity and martial arts, as well as a surprise ending.
A crazy male killer, who enjoys sex with dead female bodies and eating parts of it, kills a mans wife in a brutal fashion and disables her husband. The husband is a doctor. Sometime later, he begins his revenge against his wifes killer. He buys a prostitute and trains her to become a skilled killer. His highly unusual plan is for her to kill the villain who is protected by many armed guards. The only way to get to the villain is when he is alone with a dead body. The doctor hides a gun and ammunition in the trained prostitutes body and gives her a drug that will make her appear dead for long enough to draw the villain to her. There is a big problem: when she cuts the gun and ammo from her body she will bleed profusely and unless she gets transfusion within 22 minutes she will die.",1440720000,,1071,4.306930693069307

330894,5,6301325397,"okay, I'm biased but my feelings are real.. I met Asami at a convention where she sat at a table with the film's producer, promoting the release of Gun Woman.. she looked sexy as Hell, I asked her if the film was headed for dvd release, she looked at me wide-eyed before looking at the producer as if to say ""answer his question, I don't know what the Hell he just said"".. and she didn't, fortunately he did, and told me he hoped for an end of year (2014) distribution date.. I was nicely surprised to see it come out on bluray!

BTW, the movie is great, lots of blood and lots of scenes where Asami is naked.. what more could one want?",1439942400,2,636,4.170731707317073

330896,5,6301325397,"This was undoubtedly one of my favorite films I watched in 2014 (I had the Japanese Blu-Ray imported from Japan months ahead of this release), and although I didn't completely understand every word spoken in Japanese, I knew I found a gem. Flash forward to this release, where it does have English subtitles included, and I have to say, it was everything I could have hoped for.

Now, this is not going to be a flick for everyone, but if you're a fan of grindhouse style exploitation films, this is one YOU MUST own! In short, a doctor, known as the Mastermind is out for revenge against the man who left him partially crippled and killed his wife in front of him. The doctor buys a young woman addicted to meth, puts her through the pains of withdrawals, then trains her to be the ultimate assassin. The target in the film is the son of a very wealthy man, and the only time he is without security and vulnerable is when he is at a particular bunker... partaking in necrophilia. The plan is to cut the woman open, surgically  implant gun parts, and send her into the facility appearing to be dead as one of the bodies. She must wake up from her temporary state, rip her stitches open, assemble the handgun, and kill everyone inside before twenty-two minutes pass and she bleeds to death.

Now, you can read the synopsis ad nauseum, but no words will do this one justice. It is chock-full of inspiring practical effects (including God knows how many gallons of blood), and Asami spends the entire third act doing some incredible ass kicking totally nude! It has been called a ""goresoaked"" wild ride, and it delivers in spades! I give this the highest recommendations, and definitely call this one a buy!",1434412800,8,1703,4.5588235294117645
330897,1,6301325397,"This is a truly awful film.  Dialog and Acting are amateurish.  Production values are terrible.  The film actually appears to begin with an accidentally frozen frame.  The content belongs in a genre that might best be described as ""depraved indifference to human life.""  ONE MORE COMPLAINT.  Playing the video involves a Shout Factory TV Ad that you cannot chapter-skip, or fast-forward through (although I didn't think to try hitting the Menu Button at the time, and I can't bear to think of putting this disk back in my player).  Involuntary Ads are entirely inappropriate in these items that we pay for.",1434326400,3,606,4.9405940594059405
330898,4,6301325397,"Fun movie, great action scenes especially the end fight scenes. What surprised me the most was the great acting by the Japanese actors. Especially Asami who doesn't say one word through the entire movie, great use of expressions. However the American actors were almost laughable which brings a nice b movie quality to the show. Put your mind on hold and get ready for some fun.",1433116800,3,378,4.742424242424242
330899,4,6301325397,"(Gun Woman) is a Tarantino-esque revenge film with mostly all Japanese actors. A doctor sees his wife raped and murdered by a notorious serial killer and cannibal, but he is only crippled in the attack.

He buys a woman who's a junkie and trains her to be a deadly assasin to get revenge on the people responsible for his wife's death. As he trains her it is reminisescent of a Rocky film as she hurls tires and engages in other various forms of strength building exercises.

Of course everything seems very improbable and far fetched but still fun to watch. The maniac that raped and killed the doctors wife and hundreds of other women is really creepy looking ,bug eyed and white like a corpse.

The movie gets pretty gory with really good effects. I don't want to give anything away but it's fun if you like revenge films ,especially Asian revenge. The music was very 80s sounding like it could be from an episode of Miami Vice. The acting was over the top but effective for this genre. I liked how everything tied together in the end and we get a twist! If you like revenge, blood ,surprises and films that don't have to add up as far as common sense goes then odds are you will like (Gun Woman)",1432598400,11,1199,4.416289592760181

330901,5,6301325397,"When I had the chance to check late night stuff, I almost found this movie every night, it always caught it at the middle. So when a friend record it I found to be a very interesting guilty pleasure.
While the plot is very simple, it does what it supposed to do just entertain.
So if you are asking is this a cinematic masterpiece? well the answer is a no, nevertheless if you want just something to pass the time, I will recomend this.",1244073600,2,436,4.2023809523809526

7811931,4,6301325397,"I expected more of a Rose McGowan/ Quentin Tarantino gun woman, but this is an over-the-top piece of entertainment that the Japanese/Korean extreme film industry seems to excel at, silly on the surface yet strong on moral codes and something you just can't take your eyes off of.  It does begin in Tarantino fashion as a story told by a career assassin to his driver as they flee the scene of a job.  The themes of revenge and karma are heavy throughout and the ending has a nice twist that belies the buckets of blood journey.  Well worth a look at and a chuckle or two.",1477872000,,571,4.367924528301887
7811932,4,6301325397,"Mayumi was a beautiful Japanese girl, until she got mixed up with the wrong men, who led her down a path of drug addiction and prostitution. Finally, strung out on methamphetamines, she was sold by her pimp across to the United States. There, considered untrainable and worthless, she was sold on to a man who had a plan for her.

The man, known only as Mastermind, trained Mayumi as the perfect assassin  an expert at martial arts, an expert with a gun, and able to resist pain. And now, Mayumi is to sent to a compound where she can kill the man who raped and killed the Masterminds wife and left him a cripple. This will take all of Mayumis determination...and more!

OK, let me just say that this movie is not for the faint of heart. The movie is filled with blood, rivers of blood, and sex and violence...in rivers of blood. But nonetheless, it is a very good movie. Its a story of revenge without limit, a story with a lot of great action.

But, beyond the blood, Asami really makes this movie, bringing the story of Mayumi to life, as you watch her go from strung-out junkie to a whole woman, through the horror to the determination to do the assignment. Also, I must congratulate Noriaki Kamata, who made an excellent psychopathic villain.

So, if you like your movies violent and very well made, then Gun Woman is one that you should definitely check out. I think that youll like it.",1467158400,,1392,4.464566929133858

At times the movie looks like a cheap production to me.
BUT THERE R PARTS OF THE MOVIE THAT WOWED ME!! Extremely Bloody!
U got to watch it in order to draw your own conclusion.
U can watch it once I Guess but it's not a keepsake. I sold mine off!",1454544000,,472,3.7777777777777777

7811936,3,6301325397,"It is hard to get past the ridiculous plan that the so-called Mastermind came up with. Instead of simply ambushing his enemy in his car, at his house, or any other place where he would be vulnerable (even with bodyguards), he decides to kill him inside a virtual fortress. Even when Gun Woman gets the upper hand over the Mastermind, she still goes along with this crazy scheme that risks her own life, instead of suggesting a more rational plan, or simply getting away. It would be hard to trust someone who has murdered another girl in front of you, just to show you how long it will take a woman to die with the cuts the Mastermind intends to make on you. Since the guy checking the dead bodies was bribed, no need to conceal the parts in Gun Woman's body, just put the gun underneath her, with plenty of ammo, if you just had to take him out in the fortress. Also, when someone is obviously wearing an unconcealed bullet-proof vest, stop shooting them in the vest!  With some better writing, this could have been a lot better movie; not bad action or acting and lots of nudity, thus still the 3 stars.",1444867200,3,1105,4.390243902439025
