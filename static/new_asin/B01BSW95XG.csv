8751295,5,B01BSW95XG,"The Bird Men is a very witty comedy that has many hilarious twists  and turns but,  mostly is a  relationship story  between a separated teacher who has a great sideline aspiration to follow in his father's footsteps to be the  head of Ornithology at  a local park and his daughter who becomes an assistant to his younger rival who is initially appointed to this coveted position.  Tom Cavanagh (Flash) has a stellar performance with significant roles played by Mark Rendall (Hannibal), Fred Willard (Anchorman) and Graham Green (Dances with Wolves). A real treat for the whole family, or a couple looking to shed a few tears . Masterfully directed by Ted Bezaire. Shot in Windsor  Ontario (across the river from Detroit)  with beautiful Ojibway Park scenes.and excellent synergy among the supporting cast. Certainly, one of the best comedies of the past few years as confirmed at many festivals (Calgary, Toronto, Dubai, London ) where it was showcased. Makes an excellent gift worth seeing over and over. It features a few memorable zingers about Birds (in particular owls) that everyone can enjoy and not just a Bird Watching enthusiast. A pure five star comedy for all to enjoy.
