8526914,5,B008D1RDLC,"I have always considered Cursed to be the best contemporary movie regarding werewolves and can watch it again and again.  I'm not a big fan of They but, hey, for the price it's definitely a great buy.",1396656000,,200,4.405405405405405
8526915,3,B008D1RDLC,"At around five dollars, this is a solid presentation of two coulda-been-better horror movies from the early- to mid-00's, Wes Craven's notoriously troubled CURSED (2006) and Robert Harmon's stylish but likewise studio-tampered THEY (2002). Both films occupy a single side of a single Blu-ray in this edition, with above average audio-visual quality. I'll leave the technical nitpicking to the plethora of 'experts' staking out their little corners of the web, but to these eyes these were vast improvements over earlier DVD editions EXCEPT in one regard: the version of Craven's tongue-in-cheek werewolf thriller CURSED -- essentially a late-to-the-party remake of his smash hit SCREAM, likewise co-written by Kevin Williamson -- included here is the theatrical PG-13 cut, shorn of SEVERAL elaborate gore scenes (including a bisected-but-still-moving Shannon Elizabeth and another key character violently beheaded by shovel) which were later reinstated for the ""unrated"" DVD release. It's a shame that this version isn't present on this disc, as the effects in these sequences are so elaborate it's quite obvious the longer version was the filmmakers intended cut before the studio -- undoubtedly the Weinsteins -- ordered huge excisions to pander to that lucrative tween demographic that oddly enough stayed away in droves. Interestingly, the Blu-ray includes four featurettes for the film, nearly all of which show the uncensored gore scenes by way of explaining how the special effects were created, which is doubly frustrating if you've just finished watching the obviously neutered feature itself. Frankly, it's hardly a memorable show, but its superior uncut version should nevertheless have been included here.

Speaking of tampering, Robert Harmon's THEY also includes an alternate ending as a bonus feature (alongside a couple of deleted scenes). This ending is preferable to the ""official"" version that closes the film, but it seems likely -- once again, Weinsteins! -- that it was re-shot in order to literalize the film's evil creatures so as not to require a hoped-for teen audience have to think too hard or leave the theatre bummed out. Still, if you can find this Blu-ray for around five dollars -- which isn't hard -- it's a tolerable way to kill a few hours watching a couple of largely-forgotten but nevertheless stylishly shot misfires from directors who've definitely done better.",1385424000,5,2401,5.402666666666667
8526916,4,B008D1RDLC,"This movie is already out for purchase. Found this combo at Walmart for 5 bucks. Wanted ""They"" only, this is the closest (other release has 4 movies). I found the movie compelling and moves along quite well. Very good cast and acting is convincing. Sleeper movie not many know about. The picture is much better than the DVD, as it should be. Some soft scenes, but it seems to refocus if you will, after each occurrence. Sound says DTS on the label, but plays back DTSMA on my player (Elite 05) which for me is worth the 5 bucks alone as this movie, like many in this genre, relies heavily on the sound to generate suspense and peril. Doesn't disappoint. Very good spacing, detail and dynamics. A super clean version would of had me drop 20 without blinking. As it stands, for 5 bucks, it's a super deal for sure.
Out of a possible 5, I'd rate video a 3.5 and sound a 4.",1345680000,5,869,4.304878048780488
