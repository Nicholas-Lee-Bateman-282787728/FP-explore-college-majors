4006941,3,B002WIDRL2,"The  review by DICK YORK IS THE BETTER DICK ""ZACHARY SMITH"" ask the question
""Does anyone know if season 2 will have all uncut episodes unlike Season 1?
(which) are edited down to 22 minutes. . .""
My question:  Are they 22 minutes becuase of the deletion of commercials or is there deleted footage from the story line?  What does syndicated versions mean?  He also says you can buy a ""Bootleg"" set from NIK AT NITE  what web site is that? I check the official Nick at Nite web site and no sets are fo sale there.  And isn't a bootleg copy illlegal? Could be they are public domain shows -  HELP",1264636800,4,594,4.25
4006942,3,B002WIDRL2,"Does anyone know if Season 2 will have all uncut episodes unlike Season 1?
If the episodes are edited down to 22 minutes....there is no point to
buying this. YOu can buy a bootleg set from NIK AT NITE for 1/4th
the price if they are still using syndicated cut prints as they
did for 1/3rd of Season 1. ( iwas also forced to give this
a rating in order to post my question).",1264032000,2,373,4.054054054054054

4006967,5,B002WIDRL2,It was hard to find what I needed to complete my Clint Eastwood collection and watching these bring a lot of laughs back from my memory of this when originally aired on TV,1385942400,,171,4.212121212121212
4006968,5,B002WIDRL2,"Cast with an absolutely hilarious comedy team. Addison becomes the 2nd star of this show with his direct approach comments about Ed and Wilbur's absent-minded antics. I also love seeing all the actors that are now in their 70-80's or sadly gone in their prime. Never seeing them as young actors it really is a shock sometimes realizing who they are. The episode with Ed trying to get rid of Clint Eastwood because his horse is so studly has to be my favorite. What makes the show so funny is that we would think it might be great for animals to talk all the while thinking they would be pleasant when in actuality they would probably be more like Ed!!
 The quality of the DVD is superb especially if played on an up-converter DVD player. Highly recommend purchasing this timeless piece of comedy ""Buddy Boy""",1382140800,,807,4.56551724137931
4006969,5,B002WIDRL2,"Somehow I missed seeing Mr. Ed when I was a child in the 60s, and my husband has introduced me to Mr. Ed via these videos on Amazon.  What fun these shows are!  When we need a pick-me-up, we watch a Mr. Ed and we are sure to be smiling!  The stories are timeless and the setting is that wonderful time that we remember as children, when mommies were at home and our households were happy, peaceful places.",1377302400,,405,4.166666666666667
4006970,5,B002WIDRL2,"Well, I bought this for my Mom's birthday, and I've watched a few episodes with her. Despite my initial resistance, she made me a fan of Mr. Ed. There's just something endearing about a talking horse with a deep cowboy sounding voice and the innocence (or mischievousness) of a little kid.

I also enjoy the humans in this show, especially Alan Young as Wilbur Post. He plays Ed's owner, or should I say, Dad. It's always fun to see how he will explain away his seemingly bizarre behavior as induced by his need to cover up something Mr. Ed has done.

The only negative about this DVD is its navigation set up; it is a little different from most entertainment DVD's. When you want to watch a particular episode, instead of just letting the DVD play, you have to be very adept with your arrow buttons to make sure you wind up where you want to go. This can be a real pain if you have a DVD controller with tiny buttons. Even so, this is only a minor irritant and not a reason to avoid purchasing the DVD.

Overall, I think if you are a fan 1960's escapist television and Palominos you are going to love this DVD. Best of all, Mr. Ed is just all around clean entertainment; you will never catch Mr. Ed using fowl language because he's a horse, not a chicken.",1373068800,,1256,4.313559322033898
4006971,5,B002WIDRL2,I bought this collection for a friend of mine who is a huge Mr. Ed fan. I bought every season,1371081600,,93,3.7

4006983,5,B002WIDRL2,"To fill the gap many of us have turned to old favorite TV shows on DVD from the 50's, 60's, and 70's. Mr. Ed is one of those shows.",1365379200,,131,3.5517241379310347
4006984,5,B002WIDRL2,"Mister Ed is addictive, and being able to watch the complete second season on DVD brings back childhood memories of just how good television writing could be.  I can't stop laughing every time I watch an episode.  The 60s had a lot of good programming (The Flintstones, My Favorite Martian, The Addams Family, Gilligans Island, I Dream of Jeannie, Bewitched, just to name a few) and even if you aren't old enough to remember them, you can still find them on cable, and you must admit, they are consistently funny.

As for Mister Ed, he's not just any horse, he suffers from the  ""terrible twos, rebellious teenager, all around prankster and sentimental protector of Wilbur.  No matter what he gets into, he always has a good reason.  The question is, just how much mischief can he get into, or better still, get Wilbur in to during each episode?  This is a DVD you will watch over and over again, introducing your grandchildren or friends to hours of ageless laughter.  Just thinking about Mister Ed reading the newspaper with those huge glasses on, using the telephone to order something or report being abused, running away from home or taunting Clint Eastwood on the phone brings a smile to my face.  Even better is seeing Mister Ed in various Sets of clothing.  Now how'd they do that?!

So sit back and enjoy an hour, or two of innocent comedy and I guarantee if you didn't find yourself laughing out loud you will be humming  Mister Eds' theme song in your head for hours.",1365120000,,1478,4.620689655172414

4007003,5,B002WIDRL2,I wish there were more shows like Mr. Ed around today. This is a great series and my 11 year old really enjoys the shows.

4007005,5,B002WIDRL2,"An absolute 'must have' along with seasons 1-6. The Mr Ed series can never disappoint and provides hours upon hours of great entertainment. I was interested to learn that the 'rumour' peanut butter was used to make Mr Ed (aka Bamboo Harvester)talk - so to speak, was a 'rumour', and that a piece of string (evident in the 1st series if you look close), was the tickler. What I was amazed to learn was Ed caught on quick and knew to move his mouth when good ol' Wilbur (Alan Young), stopped talking - according to the memoirs I've read,,, and in fact was a really smart horse and thus no further prompts were needed - go figure!!!!
Well in saying, knowing a bit of behind the scenes history has also enhanced watching this fantastic horsey show which I've enjoyed watching whilst reminiscing my youth and will in future watch again and again, now owning on DVD, to enjoy at my leisure.

Definitely recommend!!!",1349049600,,909,4.576687116564417
4007006,5,B002WIDRL2,"Mister Ed is a horse. He is possibly the most famous horse in the world, due to his show's six-season run that has been constantly replayed in syndication for over half a century. But what do we really know about Mister Ed?

He is impetuous. He's single-minded in purpose. He's a tad lazy, loving to both sleep and eat. He doesn't like heavy riders. He's a Palomino who claims to be eight years old. He's a hypochondriac. He reads the newspaper, comic books and a select number of magazines. He loves watching the late movie show on his portable 60's era television. He has a real eye for the fillies. He loves carrots. He remains actively engaged with the ASPCA. And, oh yes, he can talk.

But, he only talks to Wilbur. Actually, that's not quite true, even though Mister Ed constantly repeats that claim to Wilbur (""You know I only talk to YOU!""). Mister Ed shows little to no hesitation in using the telephone to phone-order some dalliance, contact the ASPCA with a complaint, or eavesdrop on the telephone party line to catch the local gossip. (Mister Ed loves to eavesdrop on gossip, so we should add that to the above list.) All this means that, indeed, Mister Ed actually DOES talk to quite a number of people, but only when he can do so without revealing his equine identity (the exception is that he will, on occasion, talk to kids, because, in Ed's own words, ""Who'll believe a kid, anyway?""). But with Wilbur Post, Mister Ed's owner, he's as garrulous a horse as you'll ever find.

And speaking of talking, did you perhaps notice the very thing that is so obvious that you might never think about it: Mister Ed's very first word to us, in every single episode, is ""Hello!"" ""Hello! I'm Mister Ed."" The first word of each show, then, breaks Ed's own rule, because he speaks to each of us while we look at him, standing in his stable. (Cool piece of subterfuge, huh?)

Like many people in the United States, I grew up watching Mister Ed. (His name is always presented as ""Mister Ed,"" without abbreviated spelling, never as ""Mr. Ed."") As a child, the show enchanted me and made me feel like I was part of a special, magical universe. When my wife and I recently started watching the episodes on DVD, I hadn't seen the show for decades, and I wondered if I could enjoy it as much as my memories would lead me to believe. But it was easy to see right from the start that the magic was still there. I admit to being caught off guard by this: the thought of a grown man my age watching a show that ostensibly was aimed at children seemed to be an exercise that would end in boredom and a perhaps create a little dent on my childhood reminiscences.

But the magic is still there. There is absolutely something special about this most special of shows. It's engaging. It's funny. It's even sometimes thought provoking. And much like the original Andy Griffith Show, there's even an occasional lesson about life woven into the story.

The horse Mister Ed is simply gorgeous, even by horse standards. His face is the envy of horses everywhere, and the director and filing crew found a way to bring out Ed's beauty in most every scene. As a Palomino, Mister Ed is a golden chestnut brown, but for reasons that I can't fully explicate, he is best portrayed on the ""silver"" screen. It's also apparent from watching these shows afresh as an adult, that Wilbur (Alan Young) was genuinely fond of Mister Ed, and Mister Ed fond of him. That very real affection clearly shows in many episodes: it's not something that can be ""acted"" over such a long period of time. Mister Ed (real name, Bamboo Harvester), too, was an exceptionally intelligent animal who was able to do tricks and tasks that likely would have been much more difficult, or sometimes, impossible, for other horses to learn, and these skills are put to great use in the show, often with few filming cuts, or other camera trickery.

So, what is it about this show that makes it so special, and that has kept it in constant play around the world for now over half a century? We'll, it's in part the magic of the concept. Mister Ed as the prankster who is always getting Wilbur into trouble because he has called on the phone to order new furniture for his stable, or to call the ASPCA because he's not getting enough carrots. Or by sabotaging Wilbur's guests at the house because Mister Ed is missing out on the daily attention he insists upon. Or stealing Addison's delicious homegrown apples from the backyard using a variety of increasingly sophisticated techniques but nearly always found out.

Perhaps also it is watching Mister Ed carry out and execute tasks that make you wonder how it could have been done. He was a truly talented horse, and some of these actions are mesmerizing, even for horse aficionados that know all about horses from first-hand contact.

And, undeniably, Mister Ed's gorgeous face is enough to steal every single scene--and I mean every single one in which he appears--regardless of who else is present. Maybe this, too, is one of the reasons for the enduring nature of the show. Mister Ed is so gorgeous that it is hard to understand why he ultimately has so much trouble with the fillies. But it is hilarious to watch Ed with his passing love interests, sometimes resulting in Ed demanding height-increasing horseshoes (because the filly he likes is taller than he), and other times prompting him to change his diet to shed a few pounds so he'll be able to complete with the other suitors aiming for the same filly.

As a kid, the show entranced me with it's magic of a talking horse, and as an adult, I still find that impact, but I now as an adult note that one of the things that makes the show laugh-out-loud funny at points is the biting sarcasm and the great one-liners that Mister Ed constantly uses. The writing for Mister Ed's dialogue is simply excellent. How can an adult sit there and laugh at this? But you will. Mister Ed comes up with some truly hilarious lines, often delivered with defiance and irony. This is undoubtedly one of the reasons the show works so well: the deep and droll delivery of Mister Ed's lines (voiced by the un-credited Allan ""Rocky"" Lane) works so well and is so engaging that its difficult not to be hanging on every word.

As far as the technical quality of these DVD's, they are clear as anything, with only an occasional episode with less video quality (perhaps the master for those few episodes were lost). If you are watching these with an up-sampling DVD player and a flat screen TV, you're likely to be as amazed as I with the film clarity of the show. The sound track is general good, as well, with only an occasional imperfection on a couple of episodes. But for the vast majority of episodes, the video and audio are excellent. Mister Ed never looked so good.

Mister Ed is simply a delightful show. Don't worry about how they got his lips to move at just the right moments in extended conversations with nearly no camera cuts, or how Ed can call the house from the barn if the two phones are on the same line, or how Ed can type on the typewriter with a nose that would have simultaneously hit seven keys with each tap. Just accept it. It's magical. And it's not just for the kids. They will love it, but so will you.",1342742400,,7255,4.521341463414634
4007007,5,B002WIDRL2,Three generations of my family have enjoyed this show. I really love this show. It's so silly and funny to watch. I just love how Ed is always getting Wilbur Post into trouble.

I'll will be waiting for your email if you want to write me any.,1274486400,,532,3.675438596491228

a great show i highly recommend it",1272326400,,134,3.8214285714285716
4007017,5,B002WIDRL2,"My family doesn't watch modern TV because we don't share the corrupt moral(amoral) values of todays culture that saturates both the shows and the commercials. My kids can't even watch ""children's"" programs because of the highly sexualized and vulgar commercials that are thrown in with them. Mr Ed is one of those shows that we can watch as a family and our children love it as much as we do! I was so thrilled when I saw these were being released I bought season one and two as soon as they came out. I was also sad to hear of Connie Hine's death a few months ago. Anyway, buy this series and turn your own kids on to this great show and take your kids away from the trash the current producers are exposing this dead and dying culture to. You'll never regret it!",1271203200,4,764,4.3125
4007018,5,B002WIDRL2,I really love the Mr Ed Shows.  I have all of the Dvd's so far.  In season 2 there were quite a few I had not seen.  I would highly recommend this Dvd to families. etc.  I'm looking forward to season # 3.  My eleven year old daughter really enjoys watching Mr. Ed also!,1268611200,6,269,3.9074074074074074
4007019,5,B002WIDRL2,"We bought season 2 of Mr. Ed for our 10 year old son, after enjoying season 1, and the only disappointment was that one of the episodes (Mr. Ed's Blues) will not play.  The Mr. Ed series is clever, funny and enjoyed by children and adults.  We await the next season!!!",1268352000,4,268,4.235294117647059

Its a must for anyone that loves the old shows.",1267315200,4,140,3.5483870967741935
4007021,3,B002WIDRL2,"I bought Season Two because I'm a long time fan of Mister Ed.  I will say that I was disappointed when there were so many shortened episodes in Season 1. It looks like that has been corrected in this release, thank goodness.  For Season 2, they put in some old Studebaker commercials that Alan and Connie did, but the quality is really awful. I've seen the same Studebaker commercials that some collectors have, which look great. You can even see some on You Tube that look so much better than these do. Why didn't they do some research to get stuff that looked great? Especially when it can be found pretty easily? The audio interview is pretty good from Shokus. Alan and Connie were asked different questions than what most of us have heard a million times. But so much of the interview has nothing to do with Alan. Why wasn't it cut out? It's pretty annoying.
I always expect great things from Shout, but unfortunately a lot of this is sloppy.  Years ago, it may have been enough to just get the episodes out in some form.  These days, if we're going to pop for $30 or more for shows we've already got on VHS or took off of Nick at Nite,there better be a good reason.
There isn't much here for bonus features, so there's no excuse for not getting it right.",1265673600,12,1259,4.367521367521367
4007022,5,B002WIDRL2,"All the episodes on the Season 2 set are complete and uncut (a few on season 1 were cut) so that alone is enough reason to recommend this set.  Thanks for listening to consumers, Shout Factory!",1265068800,19,193,4.361111111111111
