918823,5,6304602200,"I personally think this film is far superior to trainspotting, not just  because it is set in wales, but because dark as it is it leaves you with a  smile on your face. Also it makes you proud to hear welsh spoken on the big  screen. The geography is sometimes out ( i.e they turn a corner in  port-talbot an end up in swansea 5 miles away but this seems to give the  film some distance, so it's not like just looking out the window. The twins  (Rhys & Llyr Ifans) are the dregs of society but you still have to love  them. This is the only film I have seen that is still talked about nearly 2  years after it came out. Miss it and miss out, especially if your ex-pat  welsh, the end sequence rendition of myfanwy by the Morriston orpheus choir  will bring a lump to your throat. BUY IT",961200000,5,786,4.078431372549019
918824,4,6304602200,"I believe this film is superior to the one it was often compared to- Trainspotting. For some reason this movie was billed as the Welsh version of Trainspotting when only on a superficial level do they share anything in  common. This movie is my kind of family values, as they get serious in  avenging their family's death against the fascist bullyboy rugby magnate.  Buy this film, it gets better every time, and buy the soundtrack because of  Catatonia and SFA( Rock on!)",957139200,4,472,4.719512195121951
918825,5,6304602200,"The majority visitors reading the reviews of this film will have only recently bcome aware of what i can only class as cult clasic due to Rhys Ifans appearance in notting hill.  Twin Town is the story of two brothers  who live in Swansea ( south Wales) and their crusade to gain revenge over a  wealthy roofing contractor/ local kingpin after there father has an  accident while completing some work for him - as  a basis for a film this  may not  'jump out' as the story behind a classic comedy but the key to its  success is the dark methods used by the brothers and the counter actions  from the attended targets.
Without giving away to much the introduction  of two bent policemen ( one welsh the other from Glasgow) kareokee and a  mixture of murder (watch out for the dogs head) and sex and drugs brings  the best out of all the cast.
The regional accent may cause a few  problems innitially with a few of the jokes lost on those who do not  understand the welsh humour, however even without taking this into account  i have never met anyone who has not enjoyed this film ( i have already lost  one copy to a friend)
sadly one of the origional shots involving a welsh  farmer and a sheep was highly edited and i hope that the american version  has not been edited inorder to make it politically correct.....
the  highest recommendation i can give is that i origionally bought twin town at  a cost of 15 approx $22) and when it disappeared i had no hesitation to go  and purchase another copy ....buy it and you will see what i mean .",955670400,8,1539,4.329824561403509
918826,5,6304602200,"I picked up this tape in the first place becuase I was drawn in by the clever trailer that preceeds ""Fargo"" on videotape.  I also enjoy UK dialect pictures.  While it can lag towards the end - it seems as though  the director needed to tie up some ends quickly and creatively - this is a  thoroughly enjoyable film.  I have never seen a film jump from extreme to  extreme so jarringly and yet effortlessly.  The acting is very, very  engaging - in particular, the two ""bent coppers,"" played by  Dorien Thomas (?) and Dougray Scott (soon to be hitting our shores as  Wolverine in the X-Men film) and the almost psychotic Ifans (real life)  twins.  For a film that will make you laugh, honestly drop your jaw (I've  proved this - there's one scene that will leave you agape), and  occasionally make you say, ""Nooooooo, way!"" or perhaps,  ""Wha?""  I cannot recommend this enough.  It is certainly out  there - but who wants to watch gritty reality as a form of escapism?  You'll pee yourself laughing....",947721600,7,1000,4.548022598870056
918827,5,6304602200,"Swansea City FC are the greatest football team in the world, and to my knowledge this is the only film that has ever featured their first team shirt. Both main characters regularly wear the 1997/98 version. This would  be enough for me to make this film 5 stars, but it really is excellent  anyway.",947635200,3,298,4.5
918828,4,6304602200,"A great comedy. And don't forget to turn the caption on...
A nice transition from Scotland to Wales... But I'd still consider this to be a good sequel to Trainspotting. That one was about an addict who actually  decided to go back to the ""normal life"" as defined by the  society. This one is about addicts who love their lives with nice ironies  about definition of morality.",932256000,,375,4.567164179104478

7876579,5,6304602200,"You have to appreciate British black humor to enjoy this film, but I do and I did!  My only gripe now is - RELEASE THIS IN DVD FORMAT FOR THE UNITED STATES!  I bought it in VHS, but have long since disposed of my VHS player.  You're denying many US citizens the pleasure of viewing this hysterical movie!",1399680000,2,304,4.206896551724138
7876580,5,6304602200,"I took a woman out to this movie on our 1st date. I laughed throughout the movie. She was shocked and figured I was a sicko. Maybe I am, but the film is damn funny.",1269129600,10,164,3.7142857142857144
7876581,5,6304602200,"No wonder, this produce of 1997 is a hidden rare gem of a British cinematography for depicting a revenge of twin brothers fed up with arbitrary and subhuman treatment in a typical sleepy traditional English town mirroring the UK affairs to the best.

7876582,1,6304602200,"Having seen and loved Trainspotting, and knowing that Danny Boyle helped produce this film, I foolishly rented it in the hopes of seeing a slice of Welsh life, something not often found on film. Instead, I was forced to watch two utterly unsympathetic, bloody-minded, and totally unredeemable hooligan twins do ever-more unpleasant and stupid pranks, culminating in several totally unjustified murders, with the only two characters deserving of death waltzing off into the evening! Talk about perverse film-making.

If you still think that every British film about the drug-addled, football-hooligan culture is charming and clever, please watch this film and you will soon be cured of this misconception.",1205884800,,704,5.518518518518518
7876583,2,6304602200,"I saw this film on the Sundance Channel.  The opening credits featured a rather lushly produced song that was more in line with the 1960's than the 1990's, when this film was made and took place.  So, I says to myself, they're probably being ""ironic"" (or a smug smart a--, which is what they really are), then the credits read that the executive producers were none other than Andrew MacDonald and Danny Boyle, the brains behind Shallow Grave (a smarmy, wretched piece of work) and Trainspotting (which was better, but still had some of that 90's smugness to it, but it had several good moments).  The film is on the level of a ""Tarantino goes to Wales"".  F-words abound, which is fine if there's some creativity behind it.  There isn't.  This is an ugly, nasty film that enjoys being nasty and ugly.  It's really lame.  The accents will probably be unintelligible to American ears, but my ears have always been able to decipher thick British/Welsh/Irish accents for some reason.  The film gets 2 stars because I like looking at Wales.",1173225600,,1035,4.705555555555556
7876584,3,6304602200,its all welsch.theres these two poor twin brothers who spend thier days getting high and causing very cruel and unusual things to happen. 2 cops get very mad about thier exploits and hunt them down.its not for kids.theres a lot of drug use and some nudity.theres even very nasty things the twins do.theres no other movie quite like it.maybe a bio dome meets james dean type deal.theres one particuraly nasty part where the twins pee in a chicks hair while shes singing karaoke.theres a chick.maybe thier sister who gets naked during one part.shes not hot but boobies are good! the 2 cops are very obnoxious.the last 15 to 20 minutes are very funny i think.theres a scene involving magic mushrooms that got me rolling.its a cool movie!,1097539200,,734,4.78740157480315
7876585,5,6304602200,"This is an absolute MUST SEE film. It is so accurate you could well believe it is a true life documentary. As a Welshman living in the USA, it is a perfect reminder of what it is like 'back home'. I can (and I am sure all Welshmen abroad will) relate to every word spoken and every frame flicking by. Heck it even made me homesick at one point!! Some of the scenes of nightlife in Swansea/Abertawe even reminded me of how I used to be in my youth! If you are Welsh living in another country (yep, that includes Lloegr/England) it has to be an addition to your video library, don't miss this wonderful depiction of our even more wonderful and beautiful land and people. Would love to see them make a sequel!",1084838400,7,706,4.276119402985074

  As A true Welshman living in America it is good to watch this film to remind me of Home, The people & Sense of HUMOUR! You'll love this Film & if you don't understand anything send me an E-mail & I'll happily explain it all for you. P.s. watch out for the farmer & his sheep.",1049760000,10,492,3.9494949494949494
