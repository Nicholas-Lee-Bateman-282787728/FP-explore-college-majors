1389884,2,B000053V60,"I start this with a story.  Around 10 years ago, when the Goodwill Games came to Seattle, Cirque Du Soleil came to Seattle supporting the Novueau Experience show.  Mother said, ""Let's go to the circus.  It's nothing like you've seen.""  I stopped at 'circus' and said, ""NO.""  My parents went and came back.  They made me the second time.  I was floored.  What on earth was this?
Then later, Saltimbanco came out and much later, I found Quidam.  Lost in the shuffle was Dralion.  For me, each show has been better than the last, each show has been more fantastic, more awesome, more bizarre.  With the exception of Alegria (a movie, not a live show), Dralion fits in quite poorly.  I was quite bored when watching this.  It doesn't hold the fun, emotion or fascination that Quidam or even the older Saltimbanco.  (And yes, I saw Saltimbanco summer 2000 and it was awesome)
The show felt like it was the international version of Cirque (as if it wasn't before).  You had the African dancer doing her thing.  And while I thought it may have a more Asian feel to it, it turned out to be a B-rate version of Cirque.  There were few acts that I even liked.  Handbalancing I have always found to be really entertaining and I loved the Teeterboard performance.  And that was about it.
I really should have checked it out first because it's quite a disappointment.  I admit, I compare it with Quidam.  Quidam had a wonderful story, though it was untold.  It was fun, Dralion not.  Look at the crowd in it.  They didn't look that impressed.  The hooting and hollering wasn't as loud as in the other videos.  Maybe if there was a slight story to it, it would have sucked me in better and made me more interested.
The ending was pretty unspectacular.  I don't recommend this video, but rather, Quidam.  It's even by the same director, David Mallet, but what went wrong?  Why do the other angles that are available look like they are done by a high end camcorder?
I don't know how soon I will send this back.  The show was very boring and I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Quidam is the one to buy for people who either love the show or you just want to show them what the Cirque world is about.  Dralion, leave it on the shelf or at least rent it instead.",986428800,8,2244,4.384428223844282
1389885,5,B000053V60,"I am trying to find words that describe  Cirque Du Soleil performances .... only one  comes to mind ... superb.
  I have seen both resident shows in Las Vegas, and the resident show in Orlando. I have Saltimbanco on VHS, Quidam and Dralion on DVD. It is impossible for me to say that one of this magnificent performances is a favorite over the others...I refuse to do so. Each one of this shows is so amazingly unique and  breath taking, it would be like comparing apples and oranges.

  I saw Dralion live under the big top and once again  was mesmerized by the outstanding show Cirque Du Soleil put together. It is a fantastic show. The customs are beautiful, the acts are amazing, the music is enchanting. I bought the Dralion DVD as soon as it was available for  retail and was extremely pleased with all the features.  It was worth every penny. It comes with a making of Dralion  documentary which by the way was very interesting and informative. It also has different view angles you can choose.
  The different view angles are not polished edited camera shots. In fact, they are unedited raw footage, and you can see shaky, wobbling movements by the performers, but I was very glad to see Cirque Du Soleil using the multiple angle feature. Even the big film companies don't do this. I have 90+ DVDs and Dralion is the only one in the pile with multiple angles.
  I have read other reviews complaining of poor filming  (i.e.. choppy video, short camera shots, narrow angels, etc., etc.). I would slightly agree, but we must keep in mind that during the show not everything is happening at the camera points. There is so much more going on all over the stage and everything is related to the story theme. I would hate to be the editor of a film like this.
  Even though Cirque Du soleil is not a film company, they have outdone themselves once again. I highly recommend this DVD and anything else that is Cirque Du Soleil. It is clean good fun for the whole family. You will be dazzled and mesmerized, and will never be disappointed by this folks. I recommend even more that you see the shows live every chance you get in order to get the full effect. Even though I have already seen Quidam on DVD, I am flying to Zurich in the fall to experience the grandeur of the live show....",985996800,18,2285,4.462650602409639
1389886,5,B000053V60,"I fell in love with Dralion after seeing it on Bravo back in December.  I had seen Saltimbanco in Seattle last summer and was hooked, but seeing Dralion launched me into the realm of FAN! When I saw a DVD was available, I instantly purchased it and have not regretted a moment of it.  The featurette was a wonderful insight into the development of the show.  I could have watched another 5 hours of that alone!  The show on DVD is marvelous.  The multi-angles were really fun -- having had some TV production experience, it took me back to the days in the ""truck"" directing a show!  Viktor Lee is incredible...I'll never look at jugglers the same way again and Erik Karol is a god!  His voice is sublime.  I've become a fan of countertenors in an instant.  Let me put it this way, this show has made its way into my dreams at night and I wake up smiling.  That's saying a lot considering I've never seen it live.  Dralion is worth every cent.",983750400,2,942,4.325714285714286
1389887,5,B000053V60,"I have always been a big Cirque fan and have NEVER been disappointed by any Cirque production.  This DVD is well worth your time and money.  Dralion is magical, unique and above all it touches your senses and drives your soul.  The cultural aspect of this show lives through the ancient chinese circus, and feeds upon those traditions.  The acts, amazing!!  The music, beautiful!! The stage, both modern and ancient.  If you ever have the opportunity to see a cirque production, take the time and the money to do so.  There are two shows here in Las Vegas, ""O"" and Mystere.  Both are a 5 star!!  Also don't forget to check out the DVD Quidam, a triumph in itself.....",982540800,2,667,4.53781512605042

1389889,5,B000053V60,"If you're a Cirque fan, you'll expect a great performance, and you won't be disappointed.  I saw this performance on pay-per-view, and pre-ordered the DVD.  I received it yesterday!  The acts are terriffic-  the Juggler is amazing, hand balancing, trapeze, I don't want to leave them all out, but it's simply one great act after another.  I will be catching this performance live when they come to New York in the spring!  Can't wait!!!
If you're a DVD extras fan, you'll be even more pleased!  They put a making-of featurette on the disc, along with several acts in multi-angle!  There are some trailers for Quidam (still my favorite, but only by a small margin), Dralion, and some other stuff.
This one is a must for any Cirque fan!",981590400,7,734,4.6796875
1389890,5,B000053V60,"You know the old saying, ""It's all because his parents never took him to the circus?""  The younger of my two sons had not been to a circus, until we had the chance to enter the magic of the blue and yellow tent on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis.  I think it was worth waiting almost 11 years for him to see the version of circus otherwise known as Cirque du Soleil.
  All the elements of a traditional circus are here--the jugglers, the clowns, the acrobats and high wire artists, even the animal acts.  You will have to think outside the box to recognize some of them, however, and that is the joy of Cirque's unique show.  This particular show focuses on the four elements and many versions of world beat music and dance are displayed. The acrobats and high wire artists are amazing, especially the very young girl who is a hand balancer.  The clowns are completely hilarious, and though hard-pressed to choose a favorite of all the amazing acts, my kids liked their brand of slapstick.
  Viktor, the juggler, is so unique that it took me a while to equate his performance with standard juggling acts, he was so hypnotic to see.  Everything in this show is incomparable and totally enjoyable, from the staging to the music, which was live at the tent, to the performers themselves.  My husband, who would never be caught dead in a place like Vegas, discovered they have two permanent acts there, and is ready to book a flight!
  If you are not able to see one of their shows live, be sure to catch them on screen.  I know we'll enjoy re-living the immediacy of their show on the small screen at our house, even if we never get to Vegas!",981072000,5,1657,4.443708609271523
1389891,5,B000053V60,"I've never seen a Cirque du Soleil show before and was apprehensive on dropping $100+ on something I wouldn't enjoy so I caught this on pay-per-view.
Wow - what an amazing show!  Some of the most incredible acts I have ever seen with a wonderful asian and middle-eastern influenced soundtrack.  A combination of both circus and theater with elaborate lighting, sets and costumes.  Now I'm just sorry I saw it on the small screen before seeing it live.
I immediately called up my dad and told him it's a must-see as they will be travelling to his area in the next month or two.  I, unfortunately, missed the show when it was in my area and will have to settle for the DVD.  Hmmm... it has been a while since I've seen my dad...",978825600,3,726,4.388059701492537
1389892,5,B000053V60,"My family and I saw Dralion on pay per view and were totally mesmerized.  It's an amazing show.  The clown act is hilarious and all the other acts are definitely spectacular, to say the least.  I wanted to get the dvd immediately, but unfortunately at that time it was not yet available. I will definitely preorder it now.  It's a must have for any family dvd collection.",977011200,4,371,4.492537313432836
1389893,5,B000053V60,"I just went to see Dralion Live a couple of days ago.  We pruchased the VIP package to get the royal treatment and best seats.  THIS SHOW IS PURELY HYPNOTIC, SURREAL, ARTISTIC, AND VISUALLY STUNNING.  The music is phenomenal.  The acts were very neat and the dancers all had distinct personalities that were really cool (hats off to the Indian dancer -- she was so graceful that she seemed to float)
I don't care much for clowns and they even had me laughing.
I am definitely pre-ordering this DVD just to relive what I can of this event.  Its impossible to capture everything from one camera angle (camera angle shifting within a live event hasn't been invented yet -- why did i go through that time machine) but it will still be worth seeing.  If it comes to your city -- this is one of life's little experiences worth living.  It is definitely one of the top 10 things ive seen in person in terms of entertainment value.  If you can't afford it or it's not touring anywhere near you then buy this on DVD or VHS.",976233600,8,1014,4.385026737967914
1389904,5,B000053V60,"Dralion is a very good performance by Cirque du Soleil adding many different acts with colorful costumes and make-up that continue to make them a Class AAA act...something for the whole family to watch!  Some of the DVD's from Cirque du Soleil have been a little predictable, but this one refreshes your brain for all sorts of creativity from the acts, to costumes and make-up.  Truly a Class AAA performance!",1454284800,,409,4.828571428571428
1389905,5,B000053V60,"This DVD accurately captures the brilliance that is Dralion. A little over a year ago, Dralion retired and is no longer a running production by Cirque du Soleil. This DVD has given me the chance to relive the magic again and again, forever being able to experience the wonder of Dralion.",1452556800,,287,4.647058823529412
1389906,4,B000053V60,"I had to take 1 star off because of editing/camera angle choices. It's a little frustrating when they cut away right when something great is about to happen and you can't see it. They also had an aerial act that was a lot of build up and no pay off early in the show. I think most of this act was edited out because it was odd. There's so much that's great, it was hard not to give it the full amount of stars. Now for the positive: Awesome acts. Phenomenal. Costumes are fantastic. The artistry of this production was excellent. We've gone to 10 or more live Cirque shows. This video has the most entertaining clown collection of any I've ever seen. (Usually I see them as filler.... but this show is an exception.)",1444262400,,716,4.311111111111111

1389944,3,B000053V60,"This film is not as high quality as other cirque du soleil DVDs I have purchased.  The camera work is certainly not the best, and there are too many shots of the audience.  I do not want to watch the audience, I want to watch the performance. In addition, despite being filmed with 14 cameras as the packaging boasts, they frequently chose to use shots where the stage lights obscure what is going on on the stage.
My family and I noted that the video gets slightly grainy at times.  I realize this is an older show, but I still expected better.
The music and costumes are beautiful, as expected from Cirque du Soleil.
The comic relief characters, which are common in Cirque shows, were ridiculously out of place and broke the flow of the show.  I realize they are necessary to allow time for the next group of performers to get ready, but I feel Cirque could have chosen designs that better fit the theme and look of the show.",1370044800,,927,4.4035087719298245

I have never heard of such a thing, even if it was ordered from Italy and not in English, it should have still played on my dvd player no matter where I am at.

The program includes acts like a fabulous juggler, aerial acrobats/dancers, Chinese tumblers and contortionists, and amazing parasol juggler.  The clown acts are the funniest thing I've ever seen.  The music is odd, but not irritating.  My girls watched it for the first time ever and then turned around and watched it again.  It's great.",1229040000,,415,4.942028985507246

It's playful and serious by turns, and the performers are just incredible. I almost wanted to take some Advil or Tylenol for them, watching the things they did with their bodies acrobatically. The music was kind of otherworldly, and while the show was highly Chinese-themed, the music wasn't. But that also seems to be something that Cirque does - meld the show with the music. My favorite act is the juggler. He floors me every time I see it. WELL worth seeing. I'm seeing a live show near my home this fall, and I've seen LaNouba at Disneyworld twice. Whatever they put their name to, it's fantastic. And while there may be a little suggestiveness and some very slight innuendos in some of the shows, I personally would allow any child over about 5 years old to see them.",1154736000,4,902,4.539877300613497

I returned the first copy of this video that I received because I thought it was defective when there was no sound. When the second copy did the same it took me about half an hour to figure out how to set the sound selection so that it would play.",1127174400,7,505,3.8653846153846154
1389989,3,B000053V60,"Prior to seeing Dralion, I had seen 2 live shows (Ka & La Nouba) and 2 Cirque DVD's (La Nouba & Varekai).  I was expecting something along those lines - stunning stunts, beautiful and extravegant music, elaborate costumes, and everything else we've come to expect from Cirque.

To me, Dralion just can't compare to the other shows.  Some stunts were amazing to watch but there were just too many negatives (in my opinon) for me to really enjoy the show.

For exmaple, I fully realize the necessity for the harnesses that were used.  However, for me, i'd rather see more grounded, WOW stunts (for example, Varekai's Icarian Games or the Russian Swings) than High, above the ground stunts that require a harness only because I'm not quite sure if the harness was used to ""help"" the performers do their tricks.  I'm sure it wasn't, but seeing it there just makes me wonder.

Secondly, the singers were just too predominant in this show (especially the one really freaky-looking singer that never smiled and always stared into the camera with his/her eyes wide open).  I couldn't get into the songs they were singing either.

Thirdly, the taller ""clowns"" were annoying in my opinon (especially the female clown).  I couldn't get into their acts.  The smaller clown, I must say, was entertaining.

Perhaps I'm nit-picking but the costumes for some of the performers were just weird.  Take, for example, the juggler.  I understand the body suit made with lycra (as are all Cirques' suits) but did the designer have to design a thong bikini for the guy?  Perhaps i'm old fashioned but I couldn't get into his juggling talents (and they were amazing too) without noticing his outfit.

If I had never seen a cirque show before this one, I'd have thought this was a great, spectacular DVD and would definitely go see the live show if/when it came to my vicinity.  However, in my opinion, Dralion just didn't live up to the billing.",1125446400,4,1921,4.755287009063444

You'll get to see some out-of-this world juggling, contortionists, one-hand balancing acrobat, incredible rope skipping, breath-taking high-flying teeterboard act, and much more.  A feast for the senses.",1104624000,18,464,5.585714285714285
1389991,5,B000053V60,"Dralion is the third video I've watched of the Cirque du Soleil series. For those of you not familiar with Cirque, it is seems to be a mergence of extremely well done circus acts, sans the animals, in a floor show format. Indeed, two versions of Cirque shows are currently holding forth in showrooms in prominent Las Vegas Hotels. I say versions because that's what they are. Unlike a play which can be replicated by different actors, Cirque is limited by what each particular performer does. This is both a weakness and a strength of Cirque and they have taken advantage of the strength to create multiple renditions, each with a different theme, music etc.

Cirque du Soleil originated in France in 1982 with a group of street entertainers performing for pedestrians. They proved to be so popular that new troupes were formed and finally went indoors in a circus/show format. Eventually the shows evolved into larger and larger productions, some of which could be considered extravaganzas (you don't perform Vegas with an organ grinder and a monkey).

Cirque du Soleil is now internationalized with performers from all over the globe, performing all over the world and for those who cannot see a show in person there are now numerous videos, which though probably not as exciting as being there in person, actually give one a better feel for the performances, with the closeups and varying shots. And how would I describe the shows? Well I can only speak for the three videos I have seen, Dralion, Alegria and Journey of ?Man.

Dralion like all Cirque du Soleil performances is a visual and audio treat. Unlike conventional circus's which utilize as many as three rings, Cirque uses only a single techno oriented ring with multi colored lighting. The sets are gorgeous and the costumes are as colorful as flowers in spring. In Dralion the singers along with the music, a form of world New Age, were so mesmerizing, that I wouldn't mind getting the sound track. The clown skits were both unusual and funny. The circus acts ranged from intricate jump roping to jaw dropping trapeze acts with much in between. It seems each act has a little different slant on what you have seen in the past. For me the most amazing acts were a juggler, named Viktor, of such unique style and expertise that it was mind boggling and a lady on her back flipping around a parasol on edge with her feet, amazing but believe me all the circus acts were imaginative and entertaining. There was one thing I didn't understand though. A couple times a giant hollow wheel was ushered out, for what I know not. It had nothing to do with any performance and was only out a minute or two and rolled back. It just seemed odd to this observer. Also the Chinese style simulated Dragons and Lions didn't play a very prominent part considering the show was named after them.

CONCLUSION

Being forced to create varied and divergent shows seems to have been a blessing. This means that audiences that have seen one version of Cirque and like it, would be likely to visit others, or as an alternative buy or rent the many videos. These videos would even be entertaining for children.

This particular show/video, Dralion, obviously a melding of Dragon with Lion, was filmed in Asia and a majority of performers were Asian. This leads me to believe that, even though some members were from Canada, each troupe performs mostly in their geographical area. Hence the videos allow audiences world wide to view these wonderful shows in the intimacy of their own homes. In summary I would strongly recommend this or any Cirque video for family viewing.",1101859200,6,3608,4.755591054313099
1389992,3,B000053V60,"This show is way too culture-specific to be a Cirque show. The singers tend to interrupt everything by singing so much. The music was more like noise to me and that is because the singers wouldn't stop singing. If there had been a few instrumental songs like other Cirque shows, I'd have enjoyed this show a bit more. Cirque shows were about dreams and fantasy. They didn't directly point out cultures, though they made indirect references to them. There is no ""up and down"" to the emotion in the show. There's just lots of noise and energy from begining to end which gets annoying. So its way too much ""up."" Other cirque shows are ""softer"" and allow time for relaxing and soothing, low-energy moments.",1098489600,,702,4.669354838709677
1389993,5,B000053V60,"I have owned the original Dralion DVD for some time.  I also own the DVD's of Quidam, Alegria (the show filmed in Sidney not the film) and Varekai, which I purchased toguether with this new Dralion Superbit version.  Until now Dralion had been my least favorite of the four shows.  Not that it was bad but its just that Quidam was so much better.  My problem was that as much as I tried I could never get the same sound from my original Dralion DVD.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 track was so bad that at first I returned the DVD because I guessed I had a damaged product, and it was not.  However, this new Superbit version with DTS sounds so crisp and powerfull that I have just rediscovered the show in a whole new way.  If you already own Dralion...the new DTS track on the Superbit version is so good that alone makes the purchase worth it.  Its a completely new experience.  In terms of image quality, both versions are presented in beautiful widescreen anamorphic video, however, the new Superbit version seems at times more crispier, sharp and alive with excelent color presentation.  The original version has also great colors, but most of the time this new Superbit version seems to have the edge in terms of definition when compared to the original.
Dralion is a fantastic show, with this new version I cannot say that Dralion is not as good as the other four.  They are completely different shows, if you buy one...eventualy you will end up owning the others, yes, they are that good.",1065916800,30,1489,4.53932584269663
1389994,3,B000053V60,"Every Cirque performance is worth seeing at least once, and while the DVDs can't possibly do justice to the live experience, they're entertaining momentos.  I recently saw Dralion live, so I've got that reference for comparison to this DVD edition.
Strictly as a performance, Dralion is not my favorite.  Not that it's bad in any way - just disappointing in the opportunities that it misses.  Given the rich visuals of Eastern culture to work with, the show could have been the most beautiful of the Cirque lineup.  However, it inexplicably strays into other cultures (African, Indian, etc.) and never really picks up any theme at all.  Plus, while other Cirque shows follow a plot, albeit a highly conceptual one, Dralion comes off as just a series of acts, almost like a best-of or singles compilation album.  Again, the performance is still wonderful to behold - it's just not the strongest one that I've seen.
The DVD presentation itself is very good.  Director David Mallet maintains a very consistent look with the ""Quidam"" DVD that he also helmed.  I'm guessing that the two were probably filmed for the same European TV broadcast purpose.  The DVD also includes a couple of acts which are not always being performed live on the current North American tour of Dralion, i.e. the light bulb ballet and see saw jumps.  Unfortunately, however, it has the same clown sequences as the ones included in Quidam - they're very funny, but it's a shame to have a repeat on the two discs.  Finally, the DVD also makes very good use of the multiple angles feature on certain acts.
All in all, I recommend the DVD for Cirque collectors.  If you're just getting into Cirque, I recommend the ""Quidam"" DVD instead. Or, if you really want to be awestruck, go see ""O"" in Las Vegas.",1060214400,24,1769,4.745098039215686
1389995,5,B000053V60,"Well, these Canadian guys have gone a long way since their steet performances.
This is the first show I saw of them, and of course I was shocked by the artistic twists a human body can make, this people don't limit themselves to perform acrobatic routines, they act, they are imbedded into their characters, and let them flow through them. But that's not even half of the show.
Besides excellent acting, one is served great live music -these guys are one of the greatest jazz players I've heard. Their music is not only to fill the holes, but to create and change the various moods one has to go through in order to fully log in the history. Excellent microphone editing also! And those singers! the strangely defined tone of the lead singer, made me think of Farinelli, with a very, but very wide dynamic range! Awesome indeed.
I thought that for being the first show I saw, it would be the one to impress me the most, boy, was I wrong... I had the chance to see Alegria live, and savour also the not-seen-on-screen flawless logistics of the crew, and then I got the DVD on Saltimbanco, Quidam, and many more... but these are other stories, later to be told.

The Dralion DVD captures some of that magic, but nothing is like seeing it live.  Even still, it's a great DVD.  There are times where I think they could have done a better job framing a particular act or whatever, but it's still a fantastic show.

It is like dancing to architecture... indescribable.
As of Dec. 15,2001 I hear the ""O"" DVD will not be released for 6 more years.  Now I'm buying the collection as money allows and chose Quidam as my first DVD and thought it was spectacular and can watch it over and over for it's blend of theater and human feats.  Dralion was my second choice and we saw it over the holidays.

It isn't smooth, the music isn't nearly as good as their other tours and in a word it was just dull compared to all the other Cirque tours. It looked and felt like nothing but recycled acts from prior shows thrown together with a few new twists, new costumes and music.
The only truly shining moments of this tour were the clowns who were superb and it is a real shame that their fabulously funny numbers were the only highlight of the show the 6-8 of us saw that day.

1390004,5,B000053V60,"Cirque du Soleil is a uniquely Qubcois experience. What started out as a few friends performing together in summer festivals blossomed into an international corporation synonymous with imagination, feats to dazzle the senses, music to astound the ears and costumes to dazzle the eyes. Cirque's motto is ""Invoquer l'imaginaire, provoquer les sens, voquer l'motion,"" or ""invoke the imagination, provoke the senses, evoke the emotions,"" and Dralion delivers on all these counts.
Dralion is CdS's twelveth production and is a blend of East and West. The majority of the cast is Chinese, and the acts incorporate traditional Chinese circus acts with Cirque favourites. The costumes range from African to Indian to Chinese, and the lead singers rik Karol and Agnes Sohier represent a godlike figure, l'me Force, and as such they have the most extravagant costumes.
Originally rik did all of the singing in Dralion but Agnes was added as the tour progressed. rik has since left Dralion and has been replaced by Frank Irving. The role of l'me Force was created around rik's unique countertenor voice, which is put to stunning effect in songs such as ""Stella Errans,"" and ""Hinko"" where he switches from head to chest voice at the drop of a hat.
""Ballare"" is a beautiful slow ballad/duet that accompanies one of the most stunning acts in Dralion: an aerial pas de deux in which the two performers are suspended from the ceiling by only a length of blue silk which they wrap around themselves. The Dralion soundtrack is also available for purchase (it is my favourite CdS soundtrack ever!) and recently won two awards from Billboard for being a top World Music album for 2001.
All of the acts are sure to keep you entertained, and the bright colours and silly dralions keep kids' attentions as well. And yes, there are clowns. A new breed of clowns, evidently. In keeping with the Cirque tradition of ""Reinventing the Circus"" these clowns don't squeeze into cars. They don't wear flowers that squirt water. They do pick on audience members rather mercilessly at times, but it's part of the fun.
The behind-the-scenes documentary was excellent, with lots of rehearsal footage and interviews with the composer, producer, and many of the cast. And the alternate camera angles made the show interactive! Dralion won two Emmy Awards for best show, and it's easy to see why. A fascinating fusion of world cultures. If you can't make it to a Cirque du Soleil show live, this DVD is the next best thing!",1017014400,2,2484,4.930787589498807
1390035,5,B000053V60,"I love the DVD, but when I saw Dralion LIVE, I was disappointed. The hilarious woman and man ""nurd-clowns"" that appear in several segments in the DVD were not in the live show. Also, the music was WAY too loud --to the point of distortion. And the entire dual-trapeze act was missing! For $74.40 per seat, I wanted the perfection I saw on the DVD!
As for the editing of the DVD... it's GREAT!! When they cut away to show some other interesting shot, they always come back quick enough so that I didn't feel I missed anything, but got the additional benefit of the other shots. That was in fact one of the things I missed in the live show! On the DVD, we get to see a close up of the hand-balancing girls face from floor view. And close-ups of all the other performers as well, interspersed with the wide-angle views. Essentially, every second of the DVD is an artisitic feast for the eyes, such as the arial view of the giant flag routine. At the live show I was limited to the solitary perspective of my 9th row center seat. So I think that a live version can never really compare with the DVD!
Each Cirque member puts their heart and soul into every performace, and I even felt a real human connection -- perhaps you could call it love -- from everyone I came in contact with, from the ticket seller to the man who sold me my Odwalla juice at intermmission. But, back to my DVD review...
I really enjoyed the ""Making of Dralion"" footage on the DVD. It made me appreciate all the work that goes into a show like this, especially when under a tight deadline. The music is captured beautifully, and unlike the live show, with the DVD you can set the volume to your liking! I really like the singing.
Dralion is not as good as Quidam, but it's better than any of the other Cirque DVDs I've seen. And the music really grows on you. I've taped the music from both Quidam and Dralion, and I enjoy listening to both. Even the music alone is a tranformational experience for me.

Having seen the show in person I can vouch for the fact that the lack of angles makes you miss some very amazing sights. The constant zooming and panning was nausiating at times.

As well, the behind the scenes was a welcome extra and the multi angle feature for four of the acts allowed me to see the acts that way I want and be closer to the feeling of being there (sometimes I find the camera zooms in at the inappropriate time)
Each Cirque Du Soleil is unique and once you watch one, you'll want to see others to see what these creative geniuses have in store.

1390041,5,B000053V60,"I was a part of the crew that taped the show for 5 nights and many solo acts. I feel the editing and audio did represent the show well. You still need to see it in person (at least until they come out with a 3D television). The colors and sounds are wonderful, and the bass in the soundtrack comes close to the original. A great gift to you or anyone else....",990057600,2,359,4.0
1390042,2,B000053V60,"First let me be clear - Cirque du Soleil performers and shows are of incomparable artistry, athleticism and imagination.
Cirque du Soleil's previous DVD, Quidam, is far, far superior to this effort for reasons totally unrelated to the performers, but for the near perfect camera work, direction and editing sadly lacking in Dralion.
Dralion, is nearly unwatchable due to constant edits from camera to camera, far too often right in the middle of an interesting bit of action. Not to mention the incessant cuts to quick shots of one of the singers - whose singing is O.K. but are a visual zero - so often that it stops the flow of the performance and makes me wonder how Cirque du Soleil could blow it so badly on the final edit.  Quidam flows effortlessly from start to finish.
They show some of the action in slow motion. Why???  I don't know of any DVD players without even a halfway decent slo-mo feature, so why interrupt the flow of the performance with someone else's idea of what is worth slo-mo?
Even more disappointing are the included multi-angle segments, with shaky, poorly framed shots that annoy more than enhance.  Good idea, badly executed. Quidam has no slo-mo or multiple angles.  I don't miss them a bit.
If I hadn't seen Quidam first, I might have thought more of Dralion.  As it is now, I would hope they reissue this DVD with even an average edit.",989625600,20,1369,4.640495867768595
