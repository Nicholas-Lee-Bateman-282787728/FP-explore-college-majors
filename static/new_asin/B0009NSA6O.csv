2302391,5,B0009NSA6O,"Wildflower is a very engaging and suspense filled movie. This film is definitely worth your time and attention!

We often have ""family movie nights"" at our house, so when the opportunity arose to review this film, I snatched it up. This movie will be released on DVD & VOD April 5th, 2016. It will also be available for viewing on the Lifetime Movie Network in June. I definitely agree with the ""12+"" rating that has been assigned to it, due to the weightiness of specific themes and the intensity of many scenes throughout the movie. However, having said that, there is no profanity or nudity within this film which makes it more palatable for viewing with your older teens. It is a great catalyst for family discussions about the importance of trust, honesty, and transparency. My husband and I watched this with our 15 year old daughter.

What I love most about this film, in addition to the sheer entertainment and mystery is the prevailing message of how important it is to never give up on people even when we may not completely understand them or what they are going through. Wildflower highlights the fact that the four simple words, ""I believe in you"" carry a powerful message of hope and healing. This message is communicated throughout the film, but is especially apparent through the roles of the main characters as they deal with some very difficult situations from their past. Despite the inability of their loved ones to comprehend the magnitude of their experiences, they still continue to support them!

Nathalia Ramos (Chloe) and Cody Longo (Josh) do an exceptional job of portraying their characters in an authentic manner. Their relationship which slowly builds throughout the movie is selectively subtle, but deeply moving as the two begin to trust one another beyond the casual into a more transparent level.

Wildflower also brings to light the fact that God is always present in our lives and even closer to us when we are going through difficult times. The knowledge that God's timing and purposes are not always within our comprehension is a prevailing theme within the movie as well. The trauma the main character goes through gives some insight into the struggles that someone suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may live with on a daily basis, thereby, revealing a needed sensitivity when working with persons going through this type of situation.

Wildflower is an excellent film. I highly recommend you take the time to watch it...you won't be disappointed! Thank you to Icon Media Group for this review copy of Wildflower. I received this free copy in exchange for an honest review. The opinions within this review are completely my own.",1458777600,3,2686,4.920529801324503
2302392,5,B0009NSA6O,"I had a chance to see and early screener of this amazing film. Not only is it a well crafted, ""edge of your seat"" psychological thriller, anyone who has dealt with PTSS in their family will come away with a sense of hope and encouragement. Fantastic - must watch!",1458777600,,263,4.387755102040816
2302393,5,B0009NSA6O,"I had never heard of Wildflower until I was given the opportunity to watch and review it. I am so happy that I gave this movie a try because it was a really great movie! There isn't anything predictable or typical about this movie. It's not a typical drama. It's not a typical, feel-good story with a happy ending. Its so much deeper than that. This movie is very suspenseful. Theres never a moment when you're bored. Youre always wondering whats going to happen next and your eyes are glued to the screen the entire time.

There were three main aspects of this movie that stood out to me. Grief, trauma and faith. I think every single one of us can relate to those.

One important aspect of Wildflower is that it touches on grief. People handle grief in a number of ways. Some hide it behind a smile. Some are outwardly upset. Others cry to themselves. Sometimes, people handle grief with denial. You will see all forms of grief in Wildflower and it will definitely tug at your heart strings too.

Another aspect is trauma. I think we all either have dealt with our own trauma, or we know someone personally who has. Just as people handle grief different, every one of us handles trauma differently. Sometimes the only way to cope with it is to suppress those memories and make them less painful. Eventually, we all have to heal. Wildflower takes you on a journey of a girl trying to find the answers to something terrible that happened to a young woman. In finding the answers, you will see so many lives touched and healed. You will also see how faith plays a very important role in healing and moving on.

And last but not least, faith.  Wildflower is filled with the theme of God's ultimate healing power!  That through Him, we have hope and a deeper understanding of the truth.

Wildflower is gripping, suspenseful, emotional, touching and quite powerful. It displays a perfect amount of love, faith, devotion, and strength. It gives a voice to those who may have yet to be heard.

Special thank you to Icon Media for providing me with a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review.  My review is my own personal opinion.",1458777600,,2135,4.5680628272251305

2302483,1,B0009NSA6O,"Nice beginning, but the story quickly dive-bombed into a Shyamalan-wannabe thriller without a spec of supporting evidence to convince the viewer.

Chloe, tje main character carried her dark and terrible secrets of abuse till she could do so no longer. The story of a missing girl was fascinating and crucial to her healing. Her struggle to find answers and her ultimate healing was all about God being in the midst of it all and if we listen for His voice, He always comes thru.

Wildflower was amazing and I loved the movie from beginning to end.

The movie itself has a wonderful story line that will keep you watching and wanting to know what happens.  The story line is interesting and intriguing.

The acting is average in Wildflower and has the characters play their roles well enough to become engaged and intrigued by the characters and what happens to them.",1460937600,,530,4.728260869565218

2302761,4,B0009NSA6O,"Wildflower is a well made suspense film that is rated PG-13 for thematic elements and due to some scenes too intense for younger viewers. The tension increases throughout the film as Chloe has nightmares that are occurring with increased frequency. Unable to trust anyone, and with everyone involved believing that she is delusional and in need of mental health help, Josh chooses to become her friend. Dealing with his own demons of grief and shattered faith that haunt him, his compassion and support of Chloe eases his own journey toward healing and restoration. Trauma, grief, lack of trust, abuse, rejection, and fear are all explored in this film, some in a more subtle message, but leads to a message of hope and healing. The film is good for a conversation-opener for family or small group discussion. I really liked it and give it 4.25 stars. A relative who who was visiting me says it is one of the best films she has ever seen. She watched it several times, and I gave her my copy when she left.

I received a copy of this DVD from Icon Media Group at no cost to myself in exchange for a fair and honest review.",1460505600,2,1122,4.554455445544554

 Chloe meets up with Josh, who also has a shadowy past. Josh blames himself for the death of his fiance.  Soon, Chloe confides in Josh about what she believes the dreams are trying to tell her. Josh helps Chloe and the dreams are finally settled when the killer is caught.  This killer has been in Chloe's dreams and finally the facts fall into place.  Together Chloe and Josh find help for their own problems through each other.
I loved this movie!  It was very different than most of the movies I see.  It was a bit scary, but this only adds to the greatness of this film.",1460160000,,810,4.389261744966443

2302774,5,B0009NSA6O,"Wildflower is a beautiful Christian film that explores the power of forgiveness.  Two broken souls meet on a fateful night.  Chloe Moray has nightmares of a mysterious event.  She has suffered from a past trauma and is estranged from her mother.  Josh has lost his beloved girlfriend who died a year before on a mission trip that he pressed her to take.  He cant forgive himself or bring himself to return to church where his brother is pastor.  The two cross paths and Josh and Chloe start to realize that Chloes visions may be true and related to a cold case missing person from Chloes youth.

I loved this movie.  The characters were great. I love how both Chloe and Josh were flawed people trying to figure out where to go in this world.  I loved how the story was overall a story of facing your past, admitting your mistakes, seeking forgiveness, and learning to trust.  There was no easy resolution to the story, it was a realistic look at what it takes for someone to grow as a person and move beyond a traumatic experience.
I also enjoyed the spooky atmosphere to the story and the mystery.  It was intriguing.  It felt like a great suspenseful Hitchcock movie.
The bonus features included a retrospective, trailers, and a group discussion guide.  This would be a fun movie to watch with a book club or church group.

2302775,4,B0009NSA6O,"Wildflower is a fast-paced film that centers around Chloe and the terrifying nightmares/visions she begins having, which she believes may be linked to an old missing persons case. While many peopleincluding the authoritieswrite her off as being delusional, her new friend Josh decides to help her uncover the truth. As the two get closer to discovering the trigger of Chloe's visions, they also get closer and closer to danger.

As far as suspense films go, Wildflower is very good. The suspense builds throughout the movie, and Nathalia Ramos and Cody Longo are very believable in their roles as Chloe and Josh. Overall, the acting is good (though there are a few supporting actors who don't quite seem comfortable). The film is quite enjoyable to watch, and the ending isn't apparent from the beginning.

Without at all seeming preachy or didactic, Wildflower addresses the importance of finding Christian community, providing help for those who have gone through physical and/or mental trauma, and staying connected to your children. This is a film that is suitable for teens and older, and it would be perfect for a family or small group movie night.

2302776,5,B0009NSA6O,"Have you ever felt like God has let you down? Have you ever hit rock bottom in life and just don't know how you can possibly rise up again? We have all gotten there in my opinion. We may even get there again. We are human. We get scared, we feel alone, we get confused, and our emotions take us away. I watched a movie that brings all that home. WILDFLOWER shows us that we are never as alone as we feel, and we will rise above!

WILDFLOWER is definitely a MUST SEE. I can't even stress that enough! I am recommending this movie right and left. If you love psychological thrillers you will LOVE this movie.

I personally am a big movie buff. I love all movies. In our house we even have a weekly family movie night. We watch movies with the kids and then when they are in bed me and hubby watch our own movies. That said, from my standards, this is by far one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time! Now me and my husband watched this alone, as our children are young. This movie did further show that as parents we all need to be very present, active, and invested in our children's lives. We need to talk with them daily, and stay connected. I cannot stress that enough. It is extremely important, and this movie drives that further home.

I was definitely on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. My heart raced, my brain raced, I was captured! Wildflower caught my attention immediately and the movie held my attention until the very end. There is so much suspense, drama, plot twists, friendship, family, and faith. I never could guess what would happen next, and I was shocked through it all. This is a positively riveting movie experience that will set you off on a roller-coaster of emotions. The scenes were great, the actors and actresses did a fantastic job! This movie wins every award possible in my book.

It is a clean movie which is just amazing. Especially for Christian families out there. It is so hard to find a GOOD clean movie to watch that includes faith. There is pure genius behind this film, and there is no other way to put it. The way such a situation can be kept clean, and remain as riveting as this deserves a standing ovation.
This is a great movie for teens and adults. I wouldn't go younger than teen years because it is a pretty intense movie. It is rated PG-13.
I love that this movie doesn't just provide entertainment. It provides hope! No matter our darkest hour God is with us, and we are not alone. We cannot lose our faith, and we cannot lose our hope. But if we do along one of life's hard roads He will be there with open arms to welcome us back. It never rains forever. I can see this movie providing so many out there with hope, faith, and courage. It isn't easy to touch down on trauma subjects like this movie does, but WILDFLOWER does an excellent job. This movie far surpassed my expectations.

2302777,5,B0009NSA6O,"This faith focused film is filled with suspense as a young woman named Chloe comes to terms with her difficult past with the help of Josh, a young man dealing with his own painful loss.

The subject matter is heavy, earning this film a PG-13 rating. However, its not one to be avoided as it can open up some important dialogue regarding dealing with trauma, trust, transparency, faith, and healing. While the subject matter is heavy, it is still family friendly as long as you watch with older children.

I watched this film with my 15 year old daughter and we both enjoyed it. The film is very entertaining with plenty of suspense and plot twists that keep you engaged. However, the message of the film creates a value that exceeds its entertainment value.

The film tackles the difficult subjects of trauma and grief and how to find healing. Most people think Chloe is delusional. She is very broken and in desperate need of healing from past traumas.

She meets Josh, who is dealing with his own grief, and they develop a relationship that allows them to find someone they each can trust. Through that trust they are able to come to terms with the grief and struggle that consumes their lives and to find the hope of being set free from that bondage.

Ultimately, the film shows that God is always with us and that there is hope and healing for us no matter what weve experienced.

This is a wonderful film to watch with your older children and will provide opportunities for important discussions with them.",1459814400,,1511,4.619402985074627
2302778,4,B0009NSA6O,"WILDFLOWER is a psychological thriller offering a message of HOPE for victims of trauma.

Catch your attention? Well, the pitch caught mine. How can a psychological thriller offer hope? I must know! What is this Wildflower about?

Meet Chloe, a university art student suffering from blackouts, nightmares (her nightmares will give me nightmares), and general terror. Under pressure shes losing track of whats real and whats imagined.

Meet Josh, a quiet guy with lots beneath the surface. Back from a traumatic missions trip abroad hes not looking for helphe feels like God let him down.

Chloe and Josh are thrown together for this dark and twisted mystery as they work to expose the memories Chloe has repressed for more than 12 years. Did she witness something terrible, or is it all in her head?

As their search for answers climaxes theyll face unexpected danger and in order to succeed theyll have to do something theyd both rather avoid: trust each other.

Wildflower is an intense study on faith, trust, truth, scars, and seeing below the surface.",1459814400,,1055,4.965909090909091
2302779,5,B0009NSA6O,"Just enough intensity to keep me on the edge of my seat.... really enjoyed the redemption and the message this one has to offer. I really enjoyed the entire film,and I highly recommend it.",1459728000,,188,4.5588235294117645
2302780,5,B0009NSA6O,"I really enjoyed this movie. I like to watch movies, not the TV kind, the DVD kind, because with such a busy life, I often have to get up in the middle of the movie to do something. At least that way I can pause and come back in a minute or five. I started out watching this movie with my 21 yr old daughter. The younger kids were busy watching something else in another room. Before it was over, they joined us. There are parts of this movie that are very intense, maybe even a bit frightening for younger children. I just wanted to warn you in case you also have younger children.

Chloe is a very gifted artist. She is in college and taking art classes. Chloe had a tough childhood. Her mother had some problems and Chloe spent several vulnerable years. Her only escape - her art. Her mother, now a fine lady, cannot seem to get close to Chloe no matter how hard she tries. But she has no idea what Chloe is hiding. And even Chloe is not really sure, she just knows something is not right.

Chloe begins having a recurring dream. A frightening one - more like a nightmare! She is very afraid to talk to anyone. The only friend she trusts is really no friend at all.  Finally, with no choice left, she confides in someone - Josh.
Josh, too, is struggling with his own losses. Trying to find his way, figure out his faith, and move on with his life. Providentially, although it seems to be coincidentally, his path crosses randomly with Chloe's. Enough times, that now he is the only one she trusts, and in fact the only one who truly believes her. While others think she is losing it, Josh continues to fight for her and to bring to light the truth.

This was a great movie. There are many issues dealt with in this film, such as trust, faith, forgiveness, and healing. There is quite a bit of action, and as I mentioned above, some very intense parts. There's a mystery just waiting to be solved.  There are well meaning people, who although trying to help, always seem to overlook the root of the problem or would like to settle for a quick fix of sorts. Chloe has to persevere if she wants to find faith and healing. This is a movie about hope even when hope seems lost!

I received this movie from iconmedia in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own and I am not required to review it positively.",1459468800,21,2318,4.2929061784897025

Wildflower
Rating PG-13

Things are happening to Chloe she can't explain. Feeling there is no one she can confide in she holds things in to herself. Till she meets Rebecca a girl who works at a dinner. Things keep happening when she wakes she can't remember. But someone was killed. In order to figure out what is going on she has to face her traumas that have happened in her life. Who can she believe in now Cody who is also hiding things inside. Can these two work together to find their faith?  This is a great movie great for a open discussion with a group. Who is there for you when you are hurting, is there someone who can say I believe in you? Who do you call in times of loss? Where do you stand with God?
This movie is wonderful. I am so glad I got the chance to review it. This movie will keep you glued to the screen. Great family movie no rated things in it. Have a family night and share with your family or church friends. Coming soon! Be released April 5th.",1459296000,8,984,4.146596858638744
