5677425,5,B00BV0362M,"The first full length film from writer/director Dan Jackson is a hit. In this day and time of big business studios, it is good to see that the independent film maker can, with a little hard work and determination, produce a quality product. Filmed on location in Atlanta, Texas, this movie portrays the life of a rodeo clown who discovers something is not right with the bulls and promoter. This film is a must see for anyone who supports the independent film industry.",1381017600,2,469,4.662650602409639
5677426,5,B00BV0362M,I heard about this movie from a friend of mine and saw it with them. I am from Central Texas -- I am a city gal but my uncle and cousins have been ranchers for over 200 years. The pace of the film is part of the story of town life. It was a better film than I expected and I can't wait to get my DVD. This is a KEEPER -- I want to watch this one again and again.,1379548800,3,362,3.4814814814814814
5677427,3,B00BV0362M,"Slow pace and lack of energy in the performances make this movie a snooze. It may be true to life regarding an average summer in a depressed Southwestern town, but I like a little more action in my dramas. William Sadler is the only actor in it with enough talent to rise above the material and make his character compelling. Oh well, at least Tyler Hoechlin is very nice to look at if you turn the sound off.",1377907200,2,409,4.256410256410256
5677428,5,B00BV0362M,"Like most who check this movie out, i was curious to see what actor Tyler Hoechlin did in his role. But I was surprised that the movie held it's own, and was a really nice slice-of-life story set in rural Texas. Better still, it also shows how a man-child who shuns responsibility (living his life as a rodeo clown) can impact the people around him. At the start, Hoechlin is an irresponsible good ol' boy, but by the end of the film, he learns to grow up and make some life changing choices. No explosions, very little shooting, only a few fist fights, and no nudity to speak of. This is one for mature watchers who want to settle in with a character-driven story.",1376179200,5,665,4.370967741935484
5677429,5,B00BV0362M,I watched this movie on Netflix at a friends house and loved it. I looked everywhere possible for it locally but came up empty handed. Most of the time I don't go out of my way to find a movie but this one just hit me as something specialmaybe its a Texas thing? The DVD came within a few days in perfect condition.  I would defiantly recommend this movie and buying it from the seller.,1375660800,2,386,4.1466666666666665
5677430,5,B00BV0362M,"I really enjoyed this movie, I thought it was well done for what it is (independent film). The acting was great and the cinematography was beautiful. A heartfelt movie with some mystery and bull riding, whats not to love?",1368144000,10,221,4.6923076923076925
5677431,5,B00BV0362M,"I have to confess right off I'm a huge PBR fan. I love bull riding in general. And rodeos. So I was bound to like this movie because bull riding and Tyler Hoechlin means.... awesome! Seriously though, it's a solid movie, with an interesting story line and good acting. William Sadler is always a great addition to any movie too. I think it's definitely worth buying!",1367366400,7,366,4.5606060606060606
8574429,1,B00BV0362M,"The movie was terrible. I love William Sadler, and hold mild affection for Tyler Hoechlin, but it was so strange. Because you have Kaleb who has a generic American accent, and you have his whole family with the southern drawl. His obsession that being a Rodeo Clown is his ""career"" was strange, especially with the accent thing.

The pacing was really slow. I had to skip through bits because I was falling asleep.

Sadler as always is great! He does the best he can with a lackluster script. I know people generally love Hoechlin's acting, but I am always underwhelmed by it. He does have a pretty face though, so there is that.

I wish I hadn't wasted time and money on this. But oh, well. The things you do to support the actors you love.",1510531200,,741,4.4338235294117645

8574431,5,B00BV0362M,I like to see movies that aren't as polished as most block busters.  And to watch the evolution of great actors like Tyler Hoechlin.,1483747200,,132,4.5

8574435,3,B00BV0362M,"I guess that Hollywood ran out of places where drugs could be smuggled, because now, Rodeo Bulls are part of the smuggling conspiracy. It's okay, but I just found it a bit far-fetched, so I gave up on it.

I'm sure it's okay for many people, so I gave it a 3.",1435449600,,259,3.980769230769231

8574438,1,B00BV0362M,I just ordered this movie and instead of seeing what was in the description I found out I had been given a random Japanese movie with subtitles. I was looking forward to watching this but I guess Amazon Prime had other ideas...,1391644800,,227,4.428571428571429
