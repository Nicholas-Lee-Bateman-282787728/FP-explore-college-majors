6076032,5,B00GHH9IAI,"Mako Mermaids is a completely different story line than H2O Just Add Water.  As I got further into the program, it got more interesting.  I purchased both Vol 1 and 2 of Season 1.  I'm looking forward to Season 2.  Whereas H2O was about three teenage girls who accidently became mermaids and learning to cope with it along with their normal activities,  Mako Mermaids is the opposite.  Its about three natural born mermaids that find that they have to learn to live on land with land folk.  Its a sort of fish out of water story -- pardon the pun.  I enjoyed Mako Mermaids, but If I were to choose between H2O and Mako Mermaids, I'd select H2O.  I'm hoping season 2 gets better.",1397606400,8,678,4.403225806451613
6076033,4,B00GHH9IAI,"The second half of the season really gets the story of the mermaids going. You'll need to watch volume 1 first to really understand what's going on, the story and plot move much more smoothly in this half. Our mermaids are continuing their association with Rita, a mermaid who left the pod (when?), learning more about their history and powers and becoming friends with an assortment of humans during their land adventures.
Most of the episodes seem to have Zac not trusting the girls who also seem to do a lot of bickering among themselves. We learn that mermen haven't been around in 1000 years (so the ""girls"" must be 1000 years old, right?- we aren't told, and if they arestill taking lessons!?) since they lost a war for dominance over Mako Island. Evidently the mermen had made the Trident as a weapon and one of them, taking sides with the mermaids, captured it and locked it away in the chamber Zac found. I don't know if viewers will ever get a full backstory about Mako history.

Towards the end Cam schemes with Nixie to ""help"" Zac become human again- the mermaids learn to their horror that Cam wants to be a merman with the Trident and Mako Island for himself. Zac saves everything by destroying the Trident as the girls restrain Cam above the Moon Pool with their rings.
Zac's girlfriend Evie only then learns what's going on with Zac and these three girls she's so suspicious of.

Not a bad series to watchtoo bad it will be 2015 before second season airs- without Lucy Fry and Ivy Latimer apparently. I haven't read a reason why but they won't be back and two new mermaid characters have been created/cast.
If you watched the ""cast interviews"" on volume 1 don't bother here (exactly the same stuff over again), and the description on the back of the DVD?, whoever wrote that out got the Evie detail all wrong.
Volume 2, season 1 is as good as Volume 1too bad Season 2 won't be out before next year!",1396137600,7,1914,4.528901734104046

6076041,5,B00GHH9IAI,"Love this show and so does my 4 yr old, never too old for imagination. This type of show reminds me of the way tv was in the 90s! Now it's all reality tv but this show give you the imagination and adventure and clean drama. Great show!",1433203200,,235,3.9166666666666665

6076045,3,B00GHH9IAI,I purchased both volumes of season one for my daughter. She absolutely loved H20 and was disappointed when shed finished all of the seasons. I though this was going to be a big hit but it was a bit of a bust. Its not nearly as good as the H20 series. My daughter watched two episodes and lost interest. Wish they would have done something along the lines of a follow up to the previous story line.,1420761600,,397,4.1688311688311686
6076046,2,B00GHH9IAI,"Aussies are supposedly well known for their soap operas. And opinions tend to vary as to whether they're epically good or epically bad. Needless to say it's a thing they're known for, and if you're planning to buy anything from the H2O Just Add Water series, it's something you're gonna have to take into account. While the first three seasons aren't that melodramatic, Mako Mermaids is almost nauseatingly so. Imagine 'Days of our Lives' if you deleted every sex/innuendo scene and dressed it up in fantasy genre garb. If that description doesn't appeal to you, then I guarantee you won't enjoy dipping into Mako Mermaids parts 1-2.

*Just in case you decide to give it a whirl anyway, you may find this tidbit helpful. The description on the DVD box says it has closed captioning. But when I've tried to activate it my screen always says,""no subtitles are available"". Since I have friends in the deaf/hard of hearing community, I thought it worth mentioning.",1416787200,,960,4.853658536585366
