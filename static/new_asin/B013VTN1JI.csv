8728912,5,B013VTN1JI,"This Blu-ray version has been created from the original Erato HD source material and is a result of Warner Classics acquiring the title. The original DVD version was issued in 2007 from a recording of a Royal Opera performance in 2006. This new BD version is superior in every respect both sonically and visually and should be the purchase option of choice therefore for those interested in this particular recording and who own suitable playback equipment.

As regards the production and performance the following is intended to summarise the virtues and disadvantages of the this well-known issue compared with that of the most obvious alternative  the Decca recording from 2005 featuring Patrizia Ciofi in the title role and also with Florez in the supporting role of Tonio. The Decca is also an HD recording but only available as a DVD which gives an excellent visual and sonic reproduction. The recording was made at the Teatro Felice, Genoa.

Choice between the two contenders for collectors should therefore focus on the performance and production strengths and weaknesses rather than recording quality which is good in both cases and which will give great pleasure either way.

The setting of the Genoa performance is updated to the end of WW2 and the rather Dads Army chorus represents an American unit. This is certainly as believable as the idea of Tonio entering the home lounge area in the London production seated on a tank! The chorus in the London production is younger and deliver more powerful singing than the adequate Genoa chorus who are less active but more likeable in the fatherly role. The mixed chorus in the London production is distressingly portrayed as seemingly mentally deficient characters as they wander around apparently aimlessly and without eye contact with each other as they first enter in the second act. This is a major production error that may weigh heavier than the age of the alternative troops. Both Ulivieri in Genoa and Corbelli in London do well as Suplice with Ulivieri portraying the kinder and more sympathetic relationship with Marie.

Another production choice which will be controversial and will come down to a matter of taste is the decision to give Dawn French the non-singing role of the Duchess of Crackentorp in the Royal opera performance. This role is delivered as the epitome of a rather badly behaved and crudely mannered street trader. This was no doubt intended to be funny but in reality is simply beyond belief and is therefore completely out of possible character. Maurizia Burlando is vastly to be preferred in Genoa. Both Felicity Palmer in London and Francesca Frand in Genoa deliver sympathetic renderings of the Marquise de Berkenfield with the London performance being the more hyperactive and thus more of a part with Natalie Dessay in the title role.

Natalie Dessay is unmatchable in her highly energetic delivery of the first act. She also has a more powerful and naturally more incisive vocal timbre than Ciofi in Genoa. Ciofi delivers a more finely nuanced performance in the first act but the nature of the first act plot tends to favour Dessay at this stage. Florez is equally good in both recordings throughout. He is given slightly more time to deliver a slightly more rounded performance in London but it is in Genoa that the audience can only be satisfied with a repeat of the famous Ah! Mes amis with its 9 high Cs in the first act.

It is in the second act, with the resolution of the social problems of Maries illegitimacy and her marriage options being the central focus, that there are marked differences in the two productions. Here, it is Ciofis more sensitive rendering of Marie within a more sympathetic set of characterisations provided by the supporting cast that contrasts with the more brittle portrayal of Marie and her supporting cast in London. Ciofi demonstrates at this point an absolutely superb technical control as well as a natural and gentle sense of humour. Her song rehearsal which opens act two is an astonishing tour de force of both characterisation and vocal technique. She is surrounded by an equally sympathetic set of characters which makes the final solution more joyous and naturally humane. In London Dawn Frenchs bad tempered departure rather sets the seal on that productions role characterisations.

In summary, if your understanding of this opera is more inclined to farce with a matching emphasis upon hyperactivity and all expertly delivered with complete security then the Dessay performance and production from the Royal Opera will be hard to beat. If your understanding of the opera is one which requires more sensitivity as regards the plights of both Marie and her mother within the given social situations then the Ciofi performance and production from Genoa will be hard to beat. In terms of competitive scoring, Dessay wins in act one and Ciofi wins in act two. Deciding which to choose will depend on purchasers views about the events of act two as described above.

Final choice between Dessay and Ciofi will be one of hyperactivity versus sensitivity, both well delivered",1451260800,4,5111,4.996474735605171
8728913,5,B013VTN1JI,"I bought the DVD release of this opera in 2012, if memory serves. It was very well received and reviewed accordingly. This is a re-release of that performance in Blu ray format, and presently available for purchase in the UK, which is where I got it.

So was it worth $20.00 to ""upgrade"" to Blu ray? YOU BET!!

First of all, the picture in much more crisp and vibrant. I have a bunch of Blu ray operas and wondered if re-doing an older release would work. But the picture is superb!! Colors are incredibly intense. Of course, one needs an HD TV to capture all this detail.

HD MA sound produces a sonic detail that while quite good in the DTS mode, is much more audibly complex than previously. One hears a lot that was certainly in the original release, but with HD MA sound is easily discerned. Little things like the sounds of performers moving were lost in the music, but are now noticeable without being intrusive. Orchestral detailing is also more audible.

As for the performance, I simply love this opera, having first experienced it in a Met performance with Sutherland and Pavarotti. There are three competing releases; one featuring Patrizia Ciofi, one with Mariella Devia and this one. While the others are both excellent. this one is, IMHO, far and away the best. The lead singers do a splendid job; the chorus and orchestra do a splendid job and Laurent Pelly's staging is deliciously funny.

Add to that the visual and audio magic of the Blu ray update, and one has a very special evening's entertainment!

Erato has released four other previously non Blu ray operas, and having now seen them all, I can opine without fear of contradiction that Erato did a fabulous job on all of them

Not to be missed, gentle reader!",1446768000,6,1733,4.607142857142857
