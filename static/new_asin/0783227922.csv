70867,3,0783227922,"A young woman has a choice between two cute twenty-something losers: a childish, damaged,  hipster musician slacker who's afraid of emotional commitment; and a ""yuppie"" who doesn't quite understand her high  ideals, but has more of an understanding of human nature and emotion.  Which loser will she choose?  I'm sure the suspense is killing you, but in  the meantime you can count how many 70's pop-culture references you can  catch.
Watching a bunch of young adults blundering around, trying to  live their lives the best they know how may be realistic, but I'm not sure  it's terribly rewarding or entertaining.  Reality bites, indeed.",962755200,3,638,5.116504854368932
70868,4,0783227922,"I didn't find this movie stereotypical at all, unlike some of the other posters here.  I thought that the dialogue was great, not to the level of Tarantino or Smith, but still very quick and some very good one liners,  most of them coming from Ethan Hawke.  I liked the relationship between  Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke, and one of my favorite scenes ever is when he  confesses his love to her at the end of the movie.  Janene Garafolo's  scenes at the Gap are priceless, especially when she's folding the shirts.  This is a really funny movie, and I would definitely recommend it.",958262400,2,582,4.528846153846154
70869,1,0783227922,"This unoriginal knock-off of Singles (1992)  glorifies losers who find no purpose in their life, and make little effort to find it.  The whole camera-in-the-face-of-virgins-of-the-real-world idea, first seen in  Singles, has so much more potential than realized in this film, which has  our chain-smoking heroine chosing between two equally unworthy suitors, a  stereotypical business-suit Jewish yuppie with no life, and an equally  stereotypical artistic drifter with no ambition.",955584000,9,482,6.014705882352941
70870,5,0783227922,"Just graduated from college, I can really relate to the soul searching and individualism represented in this movie.  Young people these days have no real role models, and this movie tries to document the ""reality""  of finding a place for yourself in this world without help from anyone.  This is one of the most cleverly written movies I have ever seen.  Clever,  Witty, Romantic with a '90s kick.  Don't pass up this film.",952473600,9,423,4.726027397260274
70871,5,0783227922,"Ben Stiller captures the lives of these five generation Xer's perfectly. This movie is refreshing much to the fact that it is the typical story of the trials and rocky roads of being a young adult in their early  twenties.  Stiller does not play any of the character's up to be some type  of fantasy, but he is real true to life.  This movie really sums up the  fact that sometimes...Reality does Bite.",930787200,3,402,4.4520547945205475

70907,2,0783227922,"The movie has a disconnected, difficult to follow beginning, but redeems itself somewhat with a plausible second half.  Certainly not one of Ben Stiller's best performances even as an occasional character. Winona Ryder is the real star as she juggles her first apartment with joblessness, unhappy room mates and 2 lovers who seem to perform their best when antagonizing each other.  All said, the movie was a great disappointment.",1486684800,,430,5.217391304347826
70908,4,0783227922,"As a nineties teen, this movie was my jam. Watching it again as an adult in my thirties, some of it is certainly dated, but it feels like a fun nostalgia piece. If one could possibly harken back to the good old days of aids tests, greasy hair, chain smoking and working at the gap with fondness- then this is the movie for you.

It's fun to see Winona Ryder in her heyday, Ben Stiller as a hot Saab driving yuppy and Ethan Hawke, Janeane Garofalo and many others at the start of their careers. The soundtrack is one of the very best examples of eighties and nineties indie and alt music and makes the film extra fun.
What it lacks in substance, this movie makes up for with nineties fashions and sentiments- in spades. Definitely worth the nostalgic journey or as an intro to the 90s as an era...",1486512000,3,796,4.306666666666667

For example, she throws a cigarette into the car of a guy she obviously sees as a douche even though she, in reality, seems to be a douche herself. The intended purpose of the scene was to introduce the romantic development between herself and Ben Stiller's character into the plot. But don't get excited: Ben Stiller had a serious role in this movie and drama is not his strong suit.

The story and acting was flawed and thereby wasted my time and money.",1424476800,4,572,4.72

Spoiler Alert: Woman is treated like crap by a jerk and treated pretty respectfully by a nice guy... guess which one she chooses?  The jerk of coarse.  Though this does happen sometimes in real life especially with girls who are model types (I think the modeling business really whittles down the self-esteem of many women because the guys they choose are often complete tools) that's not really a reflection of reality for the most part.

71051,4,0783227922,I was 14 years old when Reality Bites came out on video and I used to rent it all the time. I loved the characters and the music and I had the soundtrack. Its so amazing to watch this 20 years later at 34 and see all the differences and approach this film as an adult free of the daydreams I had then. I think Ben Stiller really captured a lot of the essence of the 90s in this film and all the actors are just likable and wonderful in their performances. It's also nice to see all the people who hadn't gotten their start yet pop up in bit roles. The blu-ray itself isn't extraordinary; but the film looks good and the sound was good and the music really shines. Its very nostalgic and I recommend it for anyone. For $9.96 Amazon is offering it at a great affordable price and I think it would look great in anyone's collection.,1397606400,,829,4.15527950310559

71063,4,0783227922,"Yes, I know, it's about twenty years too late for me to have watched this movie now for the very first time.  This is Winona Ryder before she shoplifted from Bloomys and played third-fiddle to Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman in Black Swan.  This is Ben Stiller before he met Mary or Polly.  This is Ethan Hawke way before Midnight.

Although there are so many things about this movie that define it as solidly '90's, namely:  the cast, the videos, the style (both men and women) and, most especially, the rampant young-adult chain smoking, I do feel that this movie could translate equally well into the 2000's and today.  Substitute selfies and youtube for videos, marijuana (legalized or otherwise) for the cigarettes, and skinny jeans for whatever it is the guys are wearing and you've got yourself a story of young adulthood set in the here and now.

Angst over post-college job prospects and career trajectory?
Angst over your love life?
Parents don't understand you?  Friends are the only ones there to support you?

This movie has all that.  The characters, although slightly cliched, are well-played by the wonderful cast (including Janeane Garafalo and Steve Zahn).  The film direction begs for 'hipster-indie cred' but that's  not a bad thing - it gives a grittiness to the overall movie that I found somewhat believable.

All in all, an enjoyable way to pass an hour or two.",1393459200,,1384,4.8382978723404255

71095,3,0783227922,"I think this movie is better as a ""period piece"" than as a movie.  It's not an indie film, even though it's trying hard to look like one.

The problem is that the characters are all such jerks that you don't care.  Steve Zahn might be OK but he's wasted on a completely underdeveloped character.  Janeane Garofalo is messed up and annoying but at least has a little potential that makes her likeable.  Ben Stiller is out of step with the other characters but I think he's young and inexperienced more than he is evil.

Ethan Hawke and Winona Ryder, though, whom we're supposed to adore, are a pair of self-centered, egotistical, [deleted expletives] who deserve each other and whatever emotionally-combative life they build together.  Interestingly, they're also the two who are least in touch with reality--Hawke is still trying to be the genius/James Dean-come-lately skating by because he's too good to do any real work, and Ryder basically expects to be handed her dream life while being permitted to think that she earned it.  The lines that are supposed to make Hawke look like he's challenging Ryder for her own good just sound, well, abusive.  The white dress scene, in particular--how is listening to Hawke tell her to change different from listening to Stiller tell her he likes the dress and she looks fine as she is?  Nothing she says is the right answer; if she keeps the dress, even if it's because she really does like it, Hawke browbeats her and accuses her of pandering to Stiller.  If she changes, Hawke will credit her for thinking independently . . . because it soothes his raging ego, even though it still wouldn't be her decision.

Anyway . . . if you didn't see this when you were in your twenties in the 1990's, it's probably too late, unless you want a peek at how Hollywood was trying to sell itself to Gen-X'ers.",1372636800,4,1839,4.659442724458204

Personally, watching Winona Ryder's career (which I feel has always been diverse and, dang the girl is truly talented) as an actress morph from her ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael"" days made this movie all the more REAL.

Plotwise - let's all admit it, the movie tackles some touchy subjects, even if there is a pinch of sappy, predictable sweetness in it - we maybe didn't land our dream job right after accepting our degrees. We maybe didn't have this swell Manhattan penthouse we dreamed of. And maybe we've all been in love, possibly once or twice. And maybe we've had our hearts broken, once or twice.

And God forbid you ever had roommates...this movie brings out the common ""I getcha"" humor that many of us have experienced: shared utilities, rent and toilet paper, scrounging for cigarette money in couch cushions, maxxing our parents' credit cards and desperately longing for some personal space (but finding solace in that roommate/friend who is there with the shoulder to cry on).

This movie ties the ""reality"" of life immediately beyond those semi-safe college and/or career path years and highlights the growth of many now uber-famous actors and actresses just as they were beginning to find their edge.

If you are a fellow Gen X'er who likes to live in the past a bit, who can shrug off Ryder's infamous shoplifting scandal and who wants to dwell in the relative safety of the past, if only for a few hours, I very highly recommend this movie.

71117,5,0783227922,"""Reality Bites"" is a movie that I found (and still find) to be very close to the real life experiences people who leave the safety of college face. If you are in your late 30s or early 40s and kinda settled in your ways and job, you probably won't get this movie anymore. You are too grown up and the issues these mid-20 something kids are facing will seem trivial and nonsensical to you. Heck, even the actors, in the movie's ""special features"" section - especially Steve Zahn and Ethan Hawke, as well as Ben Stiller - don't really get the characters they played 16 years ago anymore. They talk about how childish their struggles in retrospect seem to have been and how bratty and ungrateful they find their characters now that they themselves have reached their mid-late 30s, early 40s and apparently figured out what life is all about: ""having a career or something..."" I guess that's where the true tragedy lies: no longer being able to identify with your idealistic, hopeful, driven young self of the past anymore.

This movie is about four friends who face life - Reality - right after college. Leleina's (Winon Ryder) speech at the beginning of the movie about what her generation is going to do with the damage they have inherited and a poignant ""I don't know"" as a response sum it up pretty well. She is the valedictorian of her college and an aspiring documentary film maker. She walks around with her camera filming her friends, asking them lots of personal and intimate questions about themselves and life in order to eventually create a documentary that will mean something. She wants to make a difference in the world and just like any hopeful college student, was imagining that she would ""be somebody"" after all the hard work she put in thus far. Little did she know that Reality just doesnt work that way. It's hard to be a saint in a paradise that is crumbling and when paying your rent takes precedence over making a meaningful difference in someone's, or even your own, life.

She shares an apartment with her nerdy-hip friend Vicki Miner (Janeane Garofalo) who is a cynical yet at the same time strangely idealistic girl working at The Gap as a manager. Even though she is hip and goofy she is also lonely and feels like she is pursuing hollow ambitions. She graduated college, but the only thing she really seems to have remembered is her social security number, which she can recite to Leleina even when she is drunk and stoned at the same time. If you've gone to college in the 90s, you'll know that your social is just about the most important and over-used thing ever.

Their gay friend Sam (Steve Zahn), who seems very tight with Vicki, has even less of a clue about what he wants to do with his life now that he graduated. He is shy and has not come out to his mother yet about being gay. He thinks he needs to have a career of some sort, but just like his counterparts, is floating adrift in a sea of cluelessness about not only who he is but also what is expected of him.

And then finally there is Troy Dyer, brilliantly acted by Ethan Hawke. Troy is a rebel, the freethinker, the ""what's-it-all-mean"" guy. He is a philosophy major and was only a few units away from his BFA - and does not seem very interested in ever going back to finish up. He is superbly smart and could probably land a good paying job faster than any of his friends if he actually put some ambition and effort into it, but he doesnt want to. He is an artist and his music and philosophy mean a lot to him and he seems to have little use or respect for the establishment. His music and his philosophy mean so much to him that he is not willing to just give it all up so he can get that ""toehold in the burger industry"". His father is dying of cancer and he doesnt want to give up the one thing that means something to him and then end up like him, with tumors growing in his groin. He is madly and secretly in love with Lelaina and because that is the only non-cynical emotion he has, he has a hard time telling her to her face how he feels about her or even fully commit. He dates a lot of faceless girls whose names he often doesnt remember and whose phone numbers he can memorex even less.

Troy is the most interesting and intriguing character in this movie as he just symbolizes the struggle his generation is facing so poignantly and realistically. The philosopher and artist inside him refuses to sell out for a steady paycheck and an equally meaningless and meager profession that will catapult his life into a boring, meaningless and existential rut. He takes pleasure in the details, like ""quarter pounders with cheese, the sky about ten minutes before it starts to rain, the moment your laughter becomes a cackle..."" and all he and Leleina apparently need are 5 bucks, a coffee and good conversation. He steals a Snickers from the gas station he works at, stating that the establishment ""owed him Snickers"" and gets fired. When he moves in with Leilana and Vicky, Vicky says that it is only temporary until ""he can afford his own place"". Lelaina responds that this was the American dream of the 90s and could take years. Indeed. Even in the 2010s, if you can afford your own place by the time you are 35, you are lucky. The Dream never seems to end for Americans.

The diametrical opposite to Troy is Michael Grates (Ben Stiller). He is a bit older, a few years out of college and pretty much grounded in reality. He takes an interest in Leleina after he runs into her car by accident and has her come to his office only to find out that she is broke and cannot afford a law suit. When he first comes over to the ""maxi pad"" (as Vicky calls their apartment), Troy mistakes him for a ""collection agent"". Michael is precisely what Troy does not want to be: he wears a suit, he has a boring corporate job selling out, a steady income; in a way he has ""conformed"" to the system and he has learned to walk the line of adulthood and idealism: he is a grown-up who has learned that sometimes you gotta wrap the meatloaf in attractive wrapping (i.e. make concessions) to sell it. Troy of course thinks he's the reason Cliff's notes were invented.

This is a great movie that captures the Zeitgeist of Generation X pretty accurately. I cannot describe the so many ways in which the struggles these college graduates go through truly resembles the reality for many people in their age and place. I've lived nearly every moment and spoken nearly every dialog said in this movie in my own life. They are overeducated and underpaid and, literally, from one day to the other, have to come to terms with the fact that all the hard work they put into their education and idealism is not going to become a reality - at least not anytime soon and definitely not the way they imagined it would. Troy resists this disillusionment as much as he can - which is what makes him so appealing as a character: he represents the ""I won't surrender"" scream we all wished we had yelled out at some point in our lives to declare our independence. But we all know that  - as if he was trapped in quicksand - Troy will be sucked into accepting this biting Reality at some point in his life as well because it will sneak up on you. Let's just hope he does not end up like his father.",1287619200,12,7261,4.429640718562874

71134,4,0783227922,"I think that `Reality Bites' has been unfairly labeled as thin and hollow.  I actually feel as though the film tackles its issues with grace and delicacy, handling the subject in a way that feels complete when the credits begin to roll.  The film was never meant to be a weighty message type film but more a relaxed look at real concerns of the youths of the 90's (or `Generation X').  For what it sets out to do, I think `Reality Bites' works very well.  When you couple the finely crafted script with the exceptional cast and Ben Stiller's surprisingly attune direction you have a very entertaining and satisfying cinematic experience.

The film follows a group of friends after they graduate from college and struggle to decide what to do with their lives.  Their lives in general are being documented by Lelaina, an aspiring filmmaker.  She passes around her video camera asking her friends intimate questions and capturing their every moment on film in order to document the struggles of the average young adult.  Her friends include the promiscuous Vickie (Garofalo in a sublime supporting performance), the slacker Troy and the closeted Sammy.  Together they make for an interesting group, and when you add in Michael Grates, a video executive who takes a liking to Lelaina after a fender-bender causes them to meet.

The script allows the cast to really sink into the issues their breed of young adult faces in a world that is not ready to accept them despite the fact that they are finely crafted.  They are over-educated and under-appreciated and cast into a world that doesn't `get' them.  Each actor really grabs hold of their character and delivers a strong and passionate performance.  Janeane Garofalo is wonderful as Vickie, really getting the sense of her characters fears and ambitions.  Steve Zahn is good as Sammy, but he does take a backseat to the rest of the cast.  Ethan Hawke and Ben Stiller are both superbly cast as the two opposite ends of Lelaina's love life.  Hawke creates a very believable mess inside of Troy, and Stiller finds new depths of sincerity in order to make Michael a likable and nearly lovable man.  The real star is Winona Ryder though, who just illuminates each scene as Lelaina.  She had such a wonderful year (with this and her Oscar nominated turn in `Little Women') that it is a shame to see that her star has faded to date.

In the end I must say that I was very impressed with `Reality Bites', and am pleasantly surprised to say that it is one of the hidden (or maybe more or less misunderstood) gems of the year that was 1994.  Sure, the year in general was not overly impressive (aside from a few amazing films it was rather dull), but `Reality Bites' is one of the highlights of the year, and is definitely better than the film that ultimately won Best Picture (don't hate me because I'm right).",1219968000,19,2851,4.686746987951807
71135,4,0783227922,"[Reality Bites] is the story of four students who graduate and find themselves facing, well, reality. Troy Dyer [Ethan Hawke] is an intelligent but shiftless slacker. He plays in a band, but other than that, can't hold down a job to save his life. He has a thing for Lelaina Pierce [Winona Ryder] but the two fight the inevitable, afraid of commitment, or afraid that their friendship will suffer. Lelaina has a good job at a local TV morning show, but she hates it. She astutely judges it to be insipid, but on top of that, they won't give her documentary a chance. She lives with her friend Vickie Miner (Janeane Garofalo) who works at The Gap, and is promoted to manager. Her love life is a series of one-night stands that she ends before they can dump her, a pre-emptive strike. She worries that she has AIDS; meanwhile gay friend Sammy Gray (Steve Zahn) doesn't have that worry because he is celibate, too uptight about telling his parents to get involved with anyone. Troy, ever the slacker, starts sleeping on Lelaina and Vickie's couch--just for a while so he can get a job and pay rent somewhere--in your dreams.

Vickie Miner: Welcome to the Maxi Pad.

Ben Stiller directs this movie and he also plays yuppie Michael Grates, whose name was chosen because his character grates, though he is charming, in a cheesy, feckless way.

Lelaina: He's so cheesy; I can't watch him without crackers.

Not sure if that quote was about Michael, but anyway, he meets Lelaina when she throws a cigarette into his car while he is talking on his cell. The resulting crash throws them together, much to Troy's chagrin. When Michael starts coming around to ""The Maxi Pad"" to see Lelaina, he has to put up with Troy glaring at him from the couch.

Michael Grates: Have I stepped over some line in the sands of coolness with you? Because excuse me if somebody doesn't know the secret handshake with you.
Troy Dyer: There's no secret handshake. There's an IQ prerequisite, but there's no secret handshake.

The best Dyer/Grates confrontation is one where Michael struggles to compare him to the character of Yorrick the Jester in Shakespeare's Hamlet.

Hamlet: ""Alas, poor Yorrick. I knew him, Horatio.""

Michael makes a fool of himself, clearly out of his league with wishing there was another Troy to burn. The best he can muster is ""you sit back there in clever-clever land..."" Actually kind of a good pun and also an allusion to Peter Pan, insinuating that Troy is refusing to grow up and face reality. However, Michael has the last laugh here, because he, unlike Troy, knows that he loves Lelaina and commitment is the least of his fears. Later on, Troy scores with this dismissal of his rival:

Troy Dyer: He's the reason Cliffs Notes were invented.

[Reality Bites] opens with a college graduation, but throughout cuts back and forth between Reality and video bites of that reality being documented by Leilana Pierce (Winona Ryder). She is the valedictorian of her class, but in her speech, she has all the questions facing her generation, but her only answer is ""I don't know."" The film, and also the documentary she is working on, try to answer the questions, too.

[Reality Bites] encapsulates an era, it kind of sums up the whole Generation X zeitgeist, and it also boasts probably the best roles of their respective careers for both Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke. The characters those two play in Reality Bites are, like the actors themselves, very talented, yet frustrating in their refusal to ""live up to their potential.""

And the film itself didn't live up to its potential at the box office either. It cost about 11 million, but grossed only about 18 million. Not a total flop, but not what they had hoped for either. Yet, in retrospect, the film's achievement is that it did capture the mood of that era, and showed the angst of Generation X.

Troy Dyer: [On answering machine] ""At the beep please leave your name, number and a brief justification for the ontological necessity of modern man's existential dilemma and we'll get back to you.""

Ironically, though it snaps an accurate Polaroid of Generation X, the studios didn't want to market it as such, and avoided mentioning the Gen X-ness of it all as if it was a diagnosis of AIDS.

[Reality Bites] was based on a screenplay Helen Childress wrote in 1990 called Blue By You, Helen was hired by producer Michael Shamberg to write a film about people in their twenties. For three years she wrote and rewrote Reality Bites, generating 70 different drafts. Childress used her friends, their personalities and experiences as the basis for her film, even secretly tape-recording conversations. She took the name Troy Dyer from a childhood friend who would later try to sue her. Ben Stiller signed on to direct in 1992 and worked for many months with Childress to develop the screenplay. The script was initially turned down by all the Hollywood studios because it tried to capture the Generation X market like [Singles] and that film flopped at the box office.

After completing several period pieces, Winona Ryder was drawn to [Reality Bites] because she was looking ""for something a little more contemporary because I really wanted to wear blue jeans for a change."" After reading the script in one sitting she ""found it very true to life."" She went on to speculate, ""I think my character is very close to what I would probably have ended up as if I hadn't become an actress.""

Charlie Sheen said this of Winona: ""She was a sweet girl, but when she grew up I started to have a crush on her which lasts to this day. I also chose her film name. She was known as Horowitz and I said she should change it. We were listening to a lot of Doors music, including the tracks Riders On The Storm, and I said she should change her name to Rider with a Y. The next thing, she's Winona Ryder. No one believes me, but that's the truth.""

The movie is pretty entertaining, as a boy meets girl, boy loses girl, love triangle, but it was also prescient about the coming rise of reality shows, and the ubiquitous product placement that would soon become the norm. It hit the nail squarely on the head with a great scene that skewers the habit of Gen Xers to overuse the word ""Irony"" while completely lacking a clue as to its definition. Of course, overeducated Troy does know the definition of irony, but he is one of the chief violators when it comes to indiscriminate product placement. It is hard for him to open his mouth without mentioning a product:

Troy Dyer: There's no point to any of this. It's all just a... a random lottery of meaningless tragedy and a series of near escapes. So I take pleasure in the details. You know... a quarter-pounder with cheese, those are good, the sky about ten minutes before it starts to rain, the moment where your laughter become a cackle... and I, I sit back and I smoke my Camel Straights and I ride my own melt.

But ultimately, Reality Bites manages to take the crass commercialism, the hopeful optimism, and all the yearning for something better, of a generation in a unique place and time, and like Troy, make it into poetry.

She also had enough clout to see that Louisa May Alcott's ""Little Women"" - Polly's favorite book - was made into Little Women, with Winona in the title role of Jo March and the film dedicated to Polly Hannah Klaas.

Dick book on the screen with its integrity intact. The film also stars Robert Downey Jr. and Keanu Reeves, but everyone is rotoscopped so that they appear as animated cartoons. This was supposed to save money on special effects, but it flopped anyway. It might be an undiscovered classic, but I haven't been able to see it, either in a theater or on DVD. It disappeared without a trace, except that according to the Hollywood gossip, Keanu is now dating Winona. Can't you see them together? It is just so crazy that it just might work.",1214092800,3,11492,5.461104847801578
71136,2,0783227922,"No, this film bites!  Has there ever been another film where the main characters are so unlikable?  Winona Ryder is supposed to be the valedictorian of her class, and her acquaintance Ethan Hawke is routinely described as having a ""high IQ"" - yet they are both lazy, criminally inclined and, well, unlikable.  Ben Stiller plays a buffoon executive who is so inarticulate as to invite audience scorn.

Nor are the situations plausible.  Ryder, the ""valedictorian,"" forgets the final pages of her speech and can't perform simple arithmetic after 3 attempts.  (???)  Later, at work she whines, ""I only make $300 dollars a WEEK!!!""  If the producers had done any research into a typical valedictorian, they might have found out that most get there by hard work and discipline, can actually perform simple math, and have decent starter jobs lined up far in advance of graduation.

But ignoring that for the moment, you still have to wonder why the producers were so off-base on Gen-Xers, presumably their target audience.  If they had bothered to check, they would have found tons of minimum wage earners (which, at the time the movie came out, was LESS than $200 per week!), kids sharing housing with 10-15 friends to make ends meet, second hand cars or no cars at all, no health insurance, or living with mom just to survive etc. - and most of them not going ballistic about it either.  But instead, we have Winona in a professional job atmosphere - no hedge trimming or dish washing here - making a reasonable starter wage, which we are supposed to believe is unbearable.  Apparently since Hollywood types have a tough time making it on $1,000,000+ per year, they figure only the homeless earn $300 per week.

So, Ryder, up to her armpits in ""angst,"" embarrasses the guy she's working for on national TV and gets fired.  She then sits around in her apartment aimlessly, calls the psychic hotline and steals hundreds of dollars from her father.  Yes, this is your valedictorian displaying the work habits that got her to the top of her class.

Ethan Hawke is lazy, criminally inclined, and irritating.  So, naturally Ryder falls for him.  That, I guess, is the only redeemable point in the movie.  When viewers want to know ""how on EARTH could SHE take up with HIM??"" the answer is, correctly, ""hey, reality bites.""

It's too bad to see talented actors wasted in a film like this, because they deserve better.",1199750400,11,2406,4.779661016949152
71137,5,0783227922,"This movie changed my life.  How?  The books that the character 'Troy' (Ethan Hawke) either reads or references in the movie.  Sure, it's a great movie but what meant the most for me was the director's or writer's (or whoever it was) choice to use or reference the following books: Martin Heidegger's ""Being and Time"", Robert Pirsig's ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" and John Steinbeck's ""The Winter of Our Discontent"".  Read those books and you will be forever changed!",1195862400,16,482,4.91358024691358

If you identify with self-absorbed, pampered and immature Gen-Xers, hey great, but I spend enough time in real life trying to avoid these negative slouches, I'm sorry I deliberately visited their shallow world here.
Winona Ryders offscreen shoplifting and pill-popping troubles make her undisciplined, whiny and self-pitying role here easy to swallow, but it's still something you would not want anywhere near your plate. Watching her kvetch about the world being against her and abuse her rich daddy's credit privileges would make Gahndi want to smack her. 40 hours a week of hard labor and a little sunshine would probably do wonders for her on and off-screen persona.
Fellow pillhead/whiner co-star Garafolo hits a funny one-liner or two, but the subplot of her HIV scare is weak and she rates straight zeroes and F's as a dramatic actress. Janeane is not without worth though,I think she's great for cameos like in ""The Cable Guy"" but as a supporting star, a lead (""Truth About Cats and Dogs"") she's just not equipped with a personality or talent worth investing emotionally in.
This movie leans toward chick-flickdom with a romantic decision to be made by Ryders character. No big surprise who she chooses, by the time that's happened, little growth or resolution worthy of applause has occurred in these contemptous nitwits lives, the viewer is likely bored,unsatisfied and 99 minutes closer to death.

71139,5,0783227922,"Reality Bites is still one of the coolest movies from the '90s. This film was extremely accurate to the times and conditions of those heavy-handed days. Great performances by Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke. It is kinda weird that Ben Stiller not only stars in this but directed it as well. Stiller did a fine job directing even though his acting is another story. I like the unrequited love aspect of this film, boy loves his best friend but best friend is falling for egostical career dude. If there was one movie to watch about the impossible task of making a relationship work, I would pick Reality Bites as the one to answer all your heartsick questions.

Maybe I like it because I'm a girl, (my husband doesn't really like it, but loves Ben Stiller so I made him watch it) but I think both sexes would be entertained by it. A perfect, early 90's-era flick about the lives of young 20-somethings. I think it has a really good cast of characters and is very entertaining!",1185148800,7,434,4.37037037037037
71141,3,0783227922,"The opening speech by Lelaina (Winona Ryder) at the beginning sets an accurate mood for the rest of the film: optimism tinged with confusion and a lack of direction. In reality, the young adults in this film depict only a small slice of their generation, those who ""aren't interested in the counterculture that they [our parents] invented as if we did not see them disembowel their revolution for a pair of running shoes."" I may be a few years behind the generation portrayed in the film, but I'm not entirely without empathy for the restless plight of this group of slackers. Even so, the speech is a horrible oversimplification of the generation gap of the time, and the film is more easily digested if the core group of characters is seen as only one slice of a very large generation.

There is a lot of similarity between Reality Bites and films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garden-State/dp/B00005JNC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garden State</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harold-and-Maude/dp/6305882592/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harold and Maude</a>, sharing the same ennui and restlessness that seems insatiable and overwhelming. The striking difference, though, is Reality Bites' strong sense of friendship and community as a means of overcoming this ennui. I felt that if any of these characters were left entirely to himself, he would commit suicide, and the core group of friends is what saved them all.

Unfortunately, their friendships are not enough to keep them from slipping into a dangerous selfishness and narcissism: Lelaina refuses for a while to find a paying job, and only seems to be attracted to Troy (Ethan Hawke) because of the emotions he conjures up in her; Troy, even after saying that she is the only woman he could commit to, says, ""You can't navigate me, I might do mean things, and I might hurt you and I might run away without your permission""; Vickie (Janeane Garofalo) is addicted to sex but hates the thought of a lasting relationship; and Sammy (Steve Zahn) is full of wounded pride. Michael (Ben Stiller) is intellectually shallow, but he seems to be the only person with any emotional maturity, and he easily sees through Troy's snobby attitude.

ENDING SPOILERS: The film ends with a romance between Lelaina and Troy that seems destined to end badly if Troy doesn't wise up and accept the criticism that's been levelled at him. There's a part of me that cheered for him, but a larger part that wanted to smack him in the face until he wised up and applied for grad school. The problem with these kids is that they are immature, and have no ideal of maturity to attain to. Their parents (of the rebellious 60s generation) rejected their own parents' ideas of maturity, and so their own children have very little left to work with. Reality Bites is more of a romantic tragedy than a romantic comedy, even though it seems to turn out well in the end. I really wanted the characters to find something better to build their lives on, but when the credits rolled I was afraid they would just keep repeating their mistakes for the rest of their lives.

For what it's worth, the acting and directing are quite good, though not great. I got a kick out of seeing so many big-name actors at a younger age. Ben Stiller's direction is good, and not as manic as what he later did in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zoolander/dp/B00003CXPJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zoolander</a>.

71154,2,0783227922,"Reality Bites seemed fresh when it was first released, giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of ""X"" - that was overeducated, underemployed, plagued by the flashy, trashy commercialism of MTV, and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college.

It was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass, cruel arena of materialism can be tough, providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth - the very stuff of real movies.  Instead we have a swan dive into a Pizza Hut commercial held together by a plot so shop-worn it would have been considered exhausted in 1930.

Winona Ryder is winning as Lelaina, but one can only imagine the SATs of football players at a college where she is valedictorian.  Her ""documentary"" is appallingly narcissistic, reflecting the characteristic Gen X notion that - ""if it's about me, it's art, and it's important.""  Ethan Hawke does an excellent job as Troy, the very archetype of self-satisfied, supercilious entitlement.  We are expected to root for him, but it's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus.

Stiller, who directed - a talented fellow almost impossible to look at - plays Michael, the ""anti-Troy.""  Smooth, successful, and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of Gen X culture - if culture is the right word - he's an executive at an MTV-ish corporation.  That he improves Lelaina's preposterous ""documentary,"" rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity, is the film's dirty little secret.

Viewers surprised by who wins Lelaina's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and Liberace was gay.  Indeed, when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie.  Janeane Garofalo is outstanding as always, and John Mahoney shines as the TV morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact, a bastard.  His performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film - or on TV - than the rest of this film put together.

In fact, reality is great, this picture would have benefited from some.",1155254400,15,2342,5.080939947780679

71156,2,0783227922,"Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the ""hero"" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves ""ironic"", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.  Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays.

Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.",1144540800,6,1219,4.99009900990099

71158,3,0783227922,"This film reminds me why I like Winona Ryder so much.  She lights up the screen, really she carries the story though the cast was good, a real group of generation X'ers before they end up making babies and paying mortgages.  I thought the generation thing floundered a bit.  I guess young Ben Stiller gave this one his all; my god, his Hollywood family gave him a chance to do a thirty or forty million-dollar film.  It's certainly better than the 80's saga St Elmo's Fire, and it's far better than any Robbie Benson film from the 70's.

Ryder and handsome Ethan Hawke are pretty believable, but they don't seem like Texans to me, Houston?  Get out of here.  They live more like University of Pennsylvania pretend slackers.  Ben Stiller cannot play it straight, so he does muck-it-up, which makes it easy for Ryder and the audience to not care whether he feels anything about this girl-woman.

A much better film, really a classic that was surely influenced by this flick was Funny Ha Ha.  Shot in 16 mm, it's making its way around college campuses.  Believe me.  It cost a lot less and it's just as satisfying.

Finally she retaliates against her position working for the man when she is overqualified for the job. Janeane Garofalo, however, is the hippy of the movie. She enjoys 70's music, and 70's apparel, working at the Gap. Ethan Hawke is a genuis who feels that anything he does is almost a waste of his time until he gets a family wake up call. Steve Zahn is a man who is coming to terms with his sexuality. This is not a movie of losers, this is four people graduating from college, and dealing with the problems in life.

Director Ben Stiller offers an interesting snapshot of the mid nineties, presenting a curious perspective of that zeitgeist and its atmosphere.
Stiller himself, Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke play three dazed and confused young adults who have to deal with troublesome situations and decisions in a turning point of their lives. The story focuses, with humor and some depth, the difficult and contrived process of growing up, offering characters that have contradictory views and ideas of the world.
The movie wisely covers multiple problems of the Genration X crowd, like the stuggle to find a decent job, the indecisions after graduation, the price of independence or the choices about love. Although this picture has a few years, it still seems fresh and poignant today, focusing situations that occur everywhere.

This is a great coming-of-age comedy proving that being independant isn't as great as it looks.  The plot of four college graduates moving into a house together is highly entertaining, especially considering all four people have opposite personalities.  All of them combined as one adds lots of laughs: a college valedictorian, a sexually active person, a non-motivated rocker, and a mellow person hiding a secret.  Comedy and drama combine in the perfect scenes, namely everyone's life struggles, the making of the documentary, and falling in love.  Though certain life aspects could have been expressed more thoroughly, the film ideas are brilliant.  The acting from all the performers are great, especially Winona Ryder.

71184,1,0783227922,"This was probably the first movie I was ever tempted to walk out on.  My daughter couldn't wait to see it, and I couldn't turn down a chance to see a Winona movie back then.  As a senior member of Gen-X, I was insulted to find that the movie represented me.  Blech.  Let me assure you, it doesn't represent anyone but whining Hollywood socialites like Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Winona Rider, and Ethan Hawke.
Are we actually supposed to believe that the valedictorian hadn't memorized the conclusion to her speech, or that she lost her notes?  Are we supposed to sympathize with a character that does nothing but complain about her father, but then accepts the BMW he gives her and the gas card that she uses to pay off her astrology hotline bills?  Now maybe the second inconsistency is a cute attempt at depth, but the first is just lame.
We are told over and over that the Ethan Hawk character is smart, but at no point is he actually *shown* to be smart.  He quotes TV commercials.  He plays in a band that covers Violent Femmes songs (badly).  He majored in philosophy.  Big deal - if they didn't keep telling us, you would think that he was just a lazy, arrogant, no-talent slob.
The ""gay character"" shows up in three 10 second appearances (or maybe it was just 2, and I was hoping for a third so the movie would explain what the others were all about?).  I can't believe that anyone would include a gay character so gratuitously - maybe the rest of it ended up on the editing room floor.  If not, then I want to know - where were the Native American, black, Puerto Rican, Haitian, transvestite, transexual, AB negative, and other minority characters?
Buy this movie used (you don't want to encourage them to print more).  Destroy it and incinerate the pieces.  Then buy something worth watching and relax in the knowledge that you have done something positive for humanity.  Then go get Singles or Romy and Michele's High School Reunion - they succeed in being just as deep as RB without the pretension, and they are a heck of a lot more entertaining (and the soundtrack to Singles is better).",1073865600,14,2105,4.546419098143236
71185,4,0783227922,"When this film hit theatres in 1994, I was a high school junior who had just scored a 4 on my Advanced Placement (AP) U.S. History test, and passed my AP English and Biology tests as well. I was included in the ""Who's Who"" of American High School students (twice), selected by my high school faculty to attend three prestigious leadership camps (including a journalism conference in DC), and was a member of a popular local R&B group to boot. Oh, and I spoke at my high school graduation too. The point is, I had a lot going for me, so this movie about the utter mediocrity of post-college life (for some) meant nothing to me at the time. Except for the brilliantly simple song ""Stay,"" by Lisa Loeb, that grabbed me the first time I saw it on MTV during what I consider one of the best summers for Alternative music - period.
Now almost ten years later, the happenings in this film finally resonate with my own life experience. I can relate to Ethan Hawke's despairing character who seems to have detached himself from his miserable situation and become wrapped up in his own philisophical musings on the futility of life. And I can also certainly relate to the despair that Winona Ryder's character felt when her dreams weren't exactly coming true for her, despite what she percieved as her gift for filmmaking. The title of the film means so much more to me now than it did before. When I was an overachieving high school student, and super-involved college student at UC Santa Barbara, I thought I had the world in the palm of my hand. I thought life would be a breeze after graduation. Boy was I wrong.
The Ben Stiller character is who I thought I would be, and who I still hope to be. Because pop culture really is my passion. More than anything, Reality Bites seems to be a personal statement from Ben Stiller, a hollywood figure who I have seriously come to admire over the years. His brand of cerebral humor is definitely a breath of fresh air. He is able to point fun at otherwise devastating situations (like shattered dreams) and I have to hand it to him. I really did feel better after viewing this film.
For those of you reading this review, all I will say is this: if you've ever known what it feels like to have a life plan and realize it is not going the way you wanted it to no matter how hard you try, this film will have something to say. I don't know if I buy the ""at the end of the day, it's all about love"" solution just yet. But I'll admit that I'm a lot closer to that conclusion than I used to be.
Thanks for reading.

71186,3,0783227922,"This movie could have been really great. But, it just ended up being mediocre at best.
It's very stereotypical and predictable in it's portrayal of a bunch of twentysomethings living in an apartment together in the grunge era of the 90's.
Winona Ryder plays Lelaina Pierce, a freshly graduated college valedictorian who finds it impossible to find a job - or to choose between the two guys in her life (Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller).
It's really just a grunged out version of boy (ethan hawke) loves girl (winona ryder) but is too afraid to tell her, so girl goes off with another boy (ben stiller) and boy confesses his love to her, afraid that he will lose her forever - and now she must choose.
It's not a horrible film. But it's nothing great either. If nothing else, it's a good keepsake of the grunge movement of the early nineties.",1069545600,11,834,4.566666666666666
71187,4,0783227922,"great beginning directing movie for Ben Stiller who has a good part but then his charater gets a little annoying at the end and I liked that Ryder picked Hawke over Stiller. the funniest thing is that Steve Zahn's character turns out to be gay, hilarious. Ethan Hawke sings ""Im Nuthing"" in the bar scene and he sings it good, not perfect or awesome, but good. Garafolo is a hoot. its funny and charming and a great start for Stiller, who's sister and mom appear in this movie along with Renee Zellweger, David Spade and Kevin Pollack.",1066694400,4,534,4.515463917525773

Since the 90's of course wasn't that too long ago. Winona Ryder who plays college graduate Lelaina Pierce who likes to make documentaries. She is making a documentary of her friends who are played by: Ethan Hawke (Troy), the funny Janeane Garofalo (Vickie), Steve Zahn (Sammy), and Ben Stiller (Michael). Each of them goes through their own troubles Troy's father is suffering from Cancer and is dying, Vickie worries that she might have AIDS, Sammy is struggling to tell his parents that he's gay...and Lelania is stuck in the middle of a love triangle between Michael and Troy. It's realistic thrown in with great comedy and a great cast and storyline. Not to mention it has a great soundtrack. (You may also try to see if you can spot another upcoming star Renee Zellweger in the movie :).

Her characterisation of a somehow disgruntled young teenager wishing to make something of her life as soon as possible is simply brilliant. Ethan Hawke and Ben Stiller flirt around her, and again opposites attract as the beautiful Hawke seduces the belle by going through a lot of happenstances and quid pro quos. In the end, both of them have grown a lot and have changed, become more mature and with eyes more open at life. See it and love it ^_^",1038960000,4,521,4.553191489361702

The movie shows a neurotic yet plausible girl in her mid-twenties twisted through her job, relationships and in altogether life. She is the person you find interesting to look at, to watch, to come in contact with but you don't want to actually be her. You feel she is what American society has become. A twisted ingenious in which things very rarely go right for but in the end all suddenly comes together. This movie has become a genre all by itself. If you have any thought in your mind that this movie is even close to insufficient you have mistaken yourself.

Meanwhile, she makes a documentary of her and her friend's lives, taking an often very personal look at what each of them is like.  Soon she meets Michael, an up and coming businessman who isn't well liked by her friend Troy, a poetic and intelligent man who lacks the motivation to find a real job.  What results is a strange love triangle as Lelaina tries to find out who she really is and what she needs.
What is really great about this movie is the strong cast that includes Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, and Ben Stiller.  You can relate to Ryder's character of Lelaina, trying to find herself in a crazy world that won't grant you any favors.  I highly recommend this movie.",998352000,2,885,4.432098765432099

(this was a couple of years ago) But when I watched this again a couple of weeks ago I realized what a dope I'd been. The idea is the one I love: Half of everything is sarcasm. And when you can filter out the real things and laugh at the ones which are jokes, then you get it, and then, you'll love it. The characters aren't being clever, they're laughing at the ones who try to be:) Ok. Maybe I'm seeing some things that aren't necessarely there, but in the end all truths are just popular opinions.

(Ha) The screenplay is fantastic, the characters are developed to perfection and the entire cast makes them come alive. REALITY BITES to me is a great example of TEAMWORK. Hats off to everyone involved!
I give REALITY BITES five stars because it is clever, emotional, thought-provoking (lots of ""what ifs"" for me), entertaining, and it's one of a few movies I own that I can watch repeatedly and enjoy each time. (The first time was the best for me though.)
The entire movie is terrific; however, I especially enjoyed the love triangle between Lelaina, Michael and Troy. You can't see the ending coming because both Troy and Michael have qualities Lalaina wants and needs in a man. But she can only choose one. (That stinks doesn't it? Ha!) I believe she made the right choice for her and the same one I would have made.
REALITY BITES is a great date movie, to enjoy with friends, or solo. Bottom line--you have got to see REALITY BITES.

LALAINA: ""I was really going to be something by the age of twenty-three.""
TROY? MICHAEL?: ""Honey, all you have to be by the age of twenty-three is YOURSELF.""
You will have to watch the movie to find out who says those words to her because HE is the one that truly loves her. Another reason I give REALITY BITES five stars is because it makes me wonder what would have happened if she had picked the other man.",985046400,10,1557,4.665454545454545

However, I have a visceral negative reaction against this flick.  This, even though I love Garofalo and I like all the other actors.  I'm amazed that Ben Stiller (who I usually find entertaining) directed this mess.  I guess it was the depiction of my generation-mates as shallow and dumb that was part of it ... then there was the hideous love triangle that left Ryder's character with a choice between the boring, exploitative executive and the disaffected slacker-with-an-edge.  The pop culture references meant to appeal to Gen-Xers were grating and gratuitous.  Finally, the revelation that it's tough to start a career when you don't have self-esteem, ambition, or any kind of plan in general didn't strike me as too earth-shattering.  I know lots of people who loved this flick, and I guess it could be appealing if you're also at a crossroads in your life, you can't get enough of growing-up-in-the-80's references, and you swoon madly over hunky Ethan Hawke.

71209,2,0783227922,"I've been out of high school for six years now, and I STILL can't understand why so many of my 'hip' classmates thought Winona Ryder was such an icon.

 ""Reality Bites"" was the talk of my senior year--""Dude, it was made for US""...""Its 'The Breakfast Club' of the 90s""...""Ethan Hawke is, like, such a hottie"" (yes, that word was used back then, too) Here's the fat and skinny on ""Reality Bites""--apart from the good music, it's a cliched, muddled film about young adults who pride themselves on being 'hip' (as opposed to 'cool').  You know the type--they shop in independant record stores, wear Docs and Birkenstocks, use Salinger and TS Eliot quotes as the ""witty conversation"" portion of a date, and think being seen holding a double mocha latte will make you seem intelligent.  If you are one of these templates, this is the movie for you. If you want real movies about the young adult experience, try a Greg Arraki (pre 'Doom Generation') film or ""Over The Edge"" or ""Kids.""",977184000,11,1195,4.819512195121951

The characters are so self-consciously 'cool' that they end up coming across as being hideously uncool.  All the characters are so unlikeable and immature that it is difficult to care what happens to them.  Normally I like these actors but they are drowning here.",977097600,16,518,4.586956521739131

Who will get to spend the rest of there life with her?  In a GenX fashioned love story, Reality Bites tries to show how to fall in love in a commercial and profit based world.  Ben Stiller accurately portrays the money motivated individual, who cares more about making it then living life by his own terms.  Unfortunately, this is the path that most people must take to survive.  Ethan Hawke tries to live life on his own terms, but comes off more like a tool of the Tobacco Company.  Winona has to choose between these flawed characters, neither of whom are strong enough to provide her the kind of love she deserves.  This is her best role, and her acting is amazing.  She looks amazing too.  I wonder if director Ben asked her not to where a bra, because there is a pretty blatant change in her posture when she exits a building that's tough to overlook.  But I'm not complaining.  She definitely carries this movie, and even though both guys are idiots- they are the kind of guys most women get stuck with but don't always know it.  In the end, the old feel sorry me approach (by whom I won't divulge), wins over Winona and they're left together with some satifaction but a little 'what do we do now feeling' like at the end of the Graduate.
