8087631,2,B000BK2R46,"I wonder what film is stored at the Erotic Museum. The one of the three films that look the most like Marilyn, in my opinion, is the second film. That one has been stated as being acted by Arline Hunter. It is a much better quality and is more believable as it is primarily a tease film with poses like Marilyn made in her career. The other two simply do not look like Marilyn and the quality is so extremely bad, it is doubtful anyone could be certain. Also it seems doubtful that anyone filming would do it with such poor equipment. A stage film is shot to be seen. The first and third film are basically unwatchable.",1172707200,5,619,4.254237288135593
8087632,1,B000BK2R46,Arline Hunter is not in this film! Marilyn Monroe is Not in this film either! This is an ongoing legend. The woman in the film is not as pretty as Arline or Marilyn. Buyer BEWARE. I can't believe Amazon is listing this TRASH!,1150588800,17,225,4.255813953488372
8087633,4,B000BK2R46,"The first reviewer is wrong... and right about this DVD. ONE of the films is Arline Hunter and the back of the box says that, but there are two other movies on this disc. The actress in the main film has long been reported to be Marilyn Monroe and it is the film that her ex-husband offered $25,000 for. I does look like her, so who knows? She did do nude modeling. This movie also was screened by the AFI, discussed by the FBI, in the collection of the Erotic Museum of Hollywood and made headlines in 1980 when stills from it were featured in Penthouse and forign editions of Playboy and other magazines. The 3rd film on the disc looks little like Marilyn, but it was once circulated as a ""Marilyn Movie"" so it was also included for the heck of it. The Arline Hunter film with the coke bottle IS on this disc, but there are 2 other films that are not her.

The visiual quality of the movies is as good as any other old stag look or ""nudie cutie"". They are grainy and scratched prints. I was surprized that the disc was a dvd-r, but according to the owner of the original film, this was the only affordable format to make since there was not a big market for the movie. The dvd menu looks a little cheap, but these are rare films and a good price, so there's not much room for complaints.",1149897600,9,1289,4.19758064516129
8087634,1,B000BK2R46,"Please, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. This is NOT Marilyn Monroe. It is in fact, Arline Hunter. It sickens me that this film is being sold simply to cash in on Marilyn's name. You can view screen captures from this film all over the web. Any true Marilyn fan will instantly see that the woman in this movie is NOT Marilyn.",1149120000,24,313,4.147540983606557
