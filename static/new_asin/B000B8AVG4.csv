2408413,5,B000B8AVG4,"I like this low impact workout.  It's a switch in pace for Cathe but it's still a fun and challenging workout.  You will definately burn fat and calories here.  The step workout is about 29-30 minutes and then there is a toning segment too.  It is more geared toward a less advanced exerciser, but everyone will get benefits from this.  The cardio features faster/slower intervals and has lots of interesting-but-doable combos (e.g. ""around the world,"" ""rocking horse"" - which aren't new). It's mostly low impact, but does have some higher-impact bursts.  In the toning segment, you will use a stability ball for almost all of the exercises.  You also need some weights too.  I enjoy doing this, and as I said earlier - it is fun and motivating.  Go get this and do it 4 times a week along with other dvds to keep up your interest.",1142640000,31,831,4.598639455782313
2408414,5,B000B8AVG4,"This is Cathe's idea of a beginner workout, and the choreography is probably what she means, because in comparison to her more coordinating routines, I guess she should could say this, but make no mistake, this is not for a beginner. The moves are not hard to do, but it will nuke your legs into flames! YOU WERE WARNED! Plus, it's got a great premix with some intense lower body work mixed in the step routine, making it a few minutes longer, and I'm not even trying to go there yet. I'm still fumbling my way toward this one.",1259971200,2,527,4.333333333333333
2408415,4,B000B8AVG4,"Haven't done step for awhile, so I found this dvd a little too complicated to start back up--moves a little more advanced, and tempo a little quick, but I will keep on trying!  Nice to have a challenge to work towards.",1245628800,,218,4.317073170731708
2408416,5,B000B8AVG4,I just worked out to this video and I really love it.  Its a great work out.  Easy to follow and Cathe is a great instructor.  I cant wait to do this work out agian.,1243209600,,165,3.657142857142857
2408417,5,B000B8AVG4,"The basic step routine on the Low Impact Step DVD is easy to learn and doesn't require as much coordination as some of the other step aerobic DVDs that are available, so it can be mastered by a beginner. The Total Body Sculpting DVD can be used for a beginner or advanced exerciser by just adjusting the weights that you use for each exercise. There are a few repetitions where you toss a fitness ball slightly in the air, which requires at least a 9 ft ceiling to toss as high as they do on the DVD. Both DVDs are broken down into chapters which make it easy to al la carte your workouts or you can select to complete the entire DVD. Cathe maintains a great energy level and doesn't have an annoying voice like some of the instructors on other fitness DVDs. Out of all of the fitness DVDs I have (approximately 20), I like Cathe the best.",1231113600,7,839,4.25
2408418,5,B000B8AVG4,"I got this DVD after about 4 years of not working out much at all. I used to do Cathe's workouts off of FitTV, but after I went to college that wasn't really an option for me. I wanted to get started back up again, and I knew Cathe's workouts were what I wanted to do (she's the best!), but I knew I wasn't ready for Imax 2 or anything like that! This is perfect for where I'm at physically. It's definitely a good workout, but it didn't make me feel completely exhausted or dizzy (which would be bad!) I'd say it's probably best if you have a little previous step experience, just to get down the cuing and such. And once I get in better shape I'll probably keep this one-it's always nice to have something easier for a light day.",1225238400,2,731,4.154929577464789
2408419,4,B000B8AVG4,"I actually purchased this product for my instructor and he totally loved it and he is using some of the steps in his classes.  I keep telling him that he needed to find new steps or I will stop going to his class, so I purchased it for him.  He loved it and he is using some of the steps, at least the ones that he can remember by the time he gets to the gym.
Thank you, thank you for this product.",1221696000,2,398,3.783132530120482
2408420,5,B000B8AVG4,I've been working out for about 8 years and cathe is absolutely the best. No other at home fitness videos compares to this high quality..and great results workout.,1206835200,,163,4.857142857142857
2408421,2,B000B8AVG4,"I tried it but felt disillusioned after 10 minutes of not being able to keep up, epsepcially since I have to do mirror image to what I am seeing on the screen. Will have to try som other dvd meant for beginners to learn to do steps rather than a means to show off the pretty women and how fit they are!",1202428800,,302,3.8870967741935485
2408422,5,B000B8AVG4,"I have mostly been doing Cathe's advanced lifting routines I record off of FitTV, but what I simply cannot get are her advanced step routines. I have the cardio strength, but not the coordination. I got this routine so I could  catch up mentally  with a simpler routine that would still give me a pretty good workout. To feel fully exhausted, I just do both the step and the body sculpting back to back.

*Please note that if you are really a beginner (with little coordination) and want to start a cardio program with some step, you may need to get an even more basic routine than this.",1198281600,21,587,4.416666666666667
2408423,5,B000B8AVG4,"I started working out about 4 months ago after 2-3 years of activity.  I was about 100 pounds overweight at that time when I started eating better and exercising.  Since then, I've lost 30 pounds.  I first started doing Cathe with the DVD that came in the box with the step I purchased.  This is the second DVD I have of hers.  I think it is a step up from the basic and yet not as intense as I gather her other DVDs are.  It definitely has me sweating as I continue to build my stamina!",1178496000,14,487,4.020833333333333
8083265,5,B000B8AVG4,"This workout is for after you mastered the basic step workout of hers. The moves in the step portion she uses in a lot of her workouts combinations so once your familiar with them it's easier not to look at the tv. I use these lower intensity workouts, with heavier weight when I'm not able to workout everyday. I just need 30 mins and I know I can up the intensity to get my heart rate up. For the footwork it does get easier, I've learned you grow with cathe. I've tried other step instructors and they have different key words, For instance cathe says over face in and over, while keli roberts calls it revolving door. Or cathe does her penjamine while this other lady instructor calls it tick tock.",1497916800,,702,4.366412213740458

8083267,5,B000B8AVG4,"It may be low impact, but it sure is a great workout!  One of my favorite trainers.",1426464000,,83,3.8823529411764706
8083268,1,B000B8AVG4,"This review is of Total Body Sculpting only. This DVD would do nothing, even for a beginner. I used 5 lb weights (I usually use 3 or 4), but the sets weren't long enough to burn me out and build any muscle. I was cold at the end of the workout. There was no cool down, because things never got hot in the first place. I honestly believe that even someone who had never worked out in their life would find this easy. I understand that this is one of only a few Beginner/Intermediate level Cathe workouts, but I still expected a lot more from her. Life is made of time, and I don't see the point in investing time into exercise that does nothing. Not recommended.",1402444800,,661,4.21259842519685
8083269,5,B000B8AVG4,"I'm just getting back into exercising after a long absence due to back problems. So I wanted something low impact and easy to follow. I've always like Cathe Friedrich's videos. She explains and demonstrates all the moves so well and is very encouraging. The step routine is a bit more challenging than her ""Basic Step"" DVD but still very do-able even for a beginner. I started doing this routine without the step and am working my way up to doing the whole routine on the step (some day!). The Body Sculpting section looks easy when you first watch it but you definitely know that you worked out after doing it. Every muscle group is worked. The only very small con for me is that the step routine starts out pretty fast. I would have liked a little slower pace for the first few minutes to better warm up. But overall, I love this video and would recommend it to anyone who likes step aerobics.",1387584000,2,895,4.463414634146342
8083270,2,B000B8AVG4,"I should say that I just started using this dvd yesterday and have only run through it once, any only did the step workout not the full workout. I feel that I'm fairly proficient in basic step I can: basic, L step, V step, A step, grapevine, knee lift, curl, extend, step and tap, repeat, rock and straddle etc. That being said I could not figure out a fair portion of this routine. I kept thinking ""she really needs an intro section where she just shows you steps and lets you practice"". Even just standing there watching her (in other words not trying to move along with Kathy) I wasn't sure how to begin to figure out the moves (usually on a difficult move I can get close or at least get the beginning and fudge the rest). There are a lot of moves that involve turns and pivots and going around the step (admittedly not my strong suit). Kathy is spinning and turning like a whirling dervish and I can't get her footwork esp. not while I'm trying to spin and turn myself. The exertion level on this workout is moderate, but the moves I feel are advanced. Kathy does start out each new segment by showing you the basic version, but she goes on from that quickly and does not come back to it and all of her back up steppers are also doing the advanced routine. I suppose if I watched just the intro to each segment enough times I could pick up the basic move and when she says ""stay here or add on"" I would be able to stay, but it's frustrating none the less. I also wish she would call out what side or what leg you should be lifting, moving or using more often. I feel like she hardly ever calls out right and left. Not only would that allow me to look at my step and my feet more often, it would help me overall to know what the heck I'm doing. On some of the moves where she steps on the step and then off with a turn and a move I can't tell for the life of me which foot she's using. A simple ""left, left"" or ""left, right"" would be great. Finally there are no instructions at all what so ever as to what to do with your arms. I guess certain styles of step let you do whatever you want with your arms rather than having a preset move, but some arm movements go better than others with certain leg movements, it would be nice to have a suggested arm movement at least even if you're not expected to stick with it. I'm frustrated that I bought this dvd, but will probably have to go and get the basic step dvd to learn kathy's style first and then possibly be able to come back to this. I'm frustrated as to why she can't make a few simple changes that would allow for a variety of levels to do the routine: have one back up stepper stay on the simplified version, call out right and left, have an intro to teach you the moves, demonstrate and call out suggested arm movements. If it's her style though never to call out right and left directionals than I may have to find a different step instructor. So, unfortunate as it is my understanding that she is supposed to be the step guru.",1377648000,4,2989,4.146299483648881
8083271,3,B000B8AVG4,Would be nice if there was an option to have a different camera views. I looked for it but didn't find it,1374451200,,105,3.8181818181818183

8083273,1,B000B8AVG4,I ordered this one as well thinking I was replacing a stepper dvd that came with a stepper I purchased awhile back. It wasn't the same dvd but the picture on the front was identical. My original dvd is missing and I wanted to replace it as I absolutely loved it so I was highly disappointed this was not the one I wanted and I can't find the one I had.  :(,1324684800,,356,3.9444444444444446
8083274,5,B000B8AVG4,"I love the Low Impact Step workout on this DVD. You get a great workout in 38 minutes (I timed it). I would say this is definitely intermediate, if you have done step for awhile you will pick it up quickly. She starts out quickly and gets your heart rate up right away. Cathe keeps your brain so busy that the time flies by. The only negative for me is the shuffle-around-the-step part, it's just not made for carpet. I love to do this one when I don't have alot of time but still want to work up a good sweat.

The Body Scultping workut is very very basic and would be good for beginners. I only used  it once as it was too easy for me.",1287964800,3,637,4.0078740157480315
