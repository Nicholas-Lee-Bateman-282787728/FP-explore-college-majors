383770,5,6301945085,i think this music video was the most entertainind performanc of michael jackson's at that time i recomend it to all that like a good spooky video and michael jacksons music.,1126569600,8,174,4.645161290322581
383771,3,6301945085,"Obviously Thirller is a great movie and Michael is a great dancer. However this is not about a movie about dancing although there are various clips like ""beat it"" and of course the complete ""Thriller"" itself. There is lots of background on John Landis and Michael Jackson which is interesting. Our copy came from Galaxy Entertainment very rapidly HOWEVER be aware that the video is of extremely technical quality - the sound and the image was awful and the tracking was *terrible* - lots of static.",1044057600,14,498,4.8023255813953485
383772,5,6301945085,"what can you say about only the most Important Music Video Ever Made?hasn't been touched before or since to me. MJ forever changed the way a Video would be seen&done.the song on a whole is Average to me but with the Instrumental track&the whole Routine this turned into a ""Media"" Event.",1001289600,3,286,4.627450980392157

383993,5,6301945085,"I LOVE Michael jackson! His film the making of thriller is one of the best documantarys I have seen fore a very long time. It tells the veuer how much work that really is behind a film like that. It makes you understand. The music is great, the dancing is fantastic,if you are a fan, or if you only want to watch an outstanding film you have to buy it. BUY IT.",1278288000,,360,4.013888888888889
383994,2,6301945085,"I am not sure if it was the quality of tape or what the problem is, but the tape says to adjust your tracking which we had several times and on different machines and there was still no clear pictue.  Not happy considering I bought this as a gift for my son who is fighting cancer right now.  He wasn't that happy either!",1265760000,,321,4.079365079365079
383995,1,6301945085,"I am deeply disappointed in this rip off!  The listing said that it was in ""Nearly New Condition"" Ya!!  The tape was scratchy and it stopped playing half way through.  We couldn't even watch the whole thing. I contacted amazon to complain, nothing was done.  Last time I do business with this company.
BUYER BEWARE!!!",1265155200,,317,4.709090909090909
383996,5,6301945085,"I recently purchased a VHS of Michael Jackson's ""Making of Thriller"". I have to say I have been a fan of MJ since I was a little girl, and I was very excited I was able to find a copy of this tape. I was very satisfied with the quality and the price of the item. Also, the time it took to receive the order was amazing.",1253577600,,319,3.7761194029850746
383997,5,6301945085,"I was very pleased when I viewed this VHS. I ordered it before Michael died. I received it on the day he died. The VHS played as if it were brand new. I am so glad that I own ""The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller.""  Thank You So Much.

383998,5,6301945085,"This golden ticket of a VHS, that I found knocked me off of my feet. For any Michael Jackson fan it's a MUST HAVE!!!! I got one for my frined and I, it's only like 15 bucks. Originally coasts over 100 bucks, that's if you want the collectors edition, but I have enough Michael merchandise. The product came from a good company it was as it was listed and arrived earlier then expected, and the condition of the tape was good for it's age. If you like Michael you GOTTA get this, it's toooo precious. You won't be disapointed, I guantee it!",1237507200,2,539,4.294117647058823

384000,5,6301945085,I think thriller is michael jackson's best work ever. He actually looked darling back then. The music video's special effects were state of the art for that era in cinema and music video. Which explains why I'm freaked out by it to this day. The ghouls and sound effects were hauntingly real for an 80's music video. The music is creepy and yet still great to dance to. The choreography I have to say was amazing!,1131667200,4,413,4.447368421052632
384001,5,6301945085,"I love this nong and video. I purchased this off and it came just as expected. The video features MJ with his girlfriend walking out from a scary movie, and then zombies seal their doom everywhere! then, MJ is a zombie! A great video, so it's worth buying as well!",1131494400,3,264,4.3

7817688,5,6301945085,"This is a great making of, very humorous, The 3 Stars A Singer, A Director And A
  Makeup artist, Put them together and you have a masterpiece.

  Jacksons complete cat werewolf was awesomeand baker as a zombie was cool and
  Landis directing comedic performance is stunning.

  The rest of cast line up for the video was really good [The Zombies].

  The making of Thriller is Thrilling.
