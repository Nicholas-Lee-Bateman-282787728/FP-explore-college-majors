3651341,2,B001J4E19C,"The story was a pretty decent, suspenseful tale, the acting was fairly good, but the choppy 'shaky cam' completely ruined this movie. In some movies, 'shaky cam' is necessary (e.g. the Blair Witch Project, and Cloverfield) due to the fact that we are supposedly viewing actual footage shot by a camcorder. It made no sense to do that in Splinter. Ultimately, it ruined the pacing and suspense for me because I was sitting there trying to figure out exactly what was going on. If not for the shaky cam, I would have easily given this movie 4 stars.",1230508800,2,547,4.591836734693878

3651343,4,B001J4E19C,"I was able to check this out as a sneak peak in my own home tonight and I will say 'Splinter' is a pretty solid interesting horror film! The film is a cross breed with touches of The Thing(remake), The Blob and 28 days! Gorehounds will like this film as it pulls no punches when it comes to graphic deaths and dismemberment, but the story will keep old fashioned horror fans interested too!

The film is short and fast paced, but the characters are fairly believable and you care about them....so important to any horror film! The film begins with an attack on a gas station attendant by an unknown ""critter"" with a lot of spikes(or ""Splinters""..if you will)sticking out of it. I don't usually like to tell a whole lot about a film and prefer to let the viewer see things unfold on their own. The best part of the movie is finding out what these critters are or who?! I don't know if you want to spend your money seeing this in the theater as it is only around an hour and 15 minutes long, but I know I will be looking to buy this film when it becomes available on DVD.....when the price in right! ;-b",1225238400,38,1101,4.267942583732057

3651357,5,B001J4E19C,"I was surprised how much I loved this movie since I wasn't expecting much. You'll read others about the low quality and some say bad acting but I disagree.

The movie starts off with a quick incident and then cuts to our main characters. I didn't find it too slow before the action started. Yes there was a middle section before it comes but you're into character development. This horror called Splinter is an interesting idea and one I found done very well. Yes there are parts that I'm sure you'll disagree with the character but you'll find yourself wondering who's next and who will survive. Small cast of main characters, 4 in total, with a few added in to help the plot continue. Enjoyed very much and made me rethink possible road trips.",1486080000,,745,4.559701492537314

It's a black goo-turned black spikes that scratches you (you get a splinter, get it!), then kills you, then uses your body as a marionette to stalk the next prey, or in the case of a hand, move around like the hand from The Addams Family.  There's no explanation of what the goo is--maybe it has something to do with oil??  The only character remotely interesting is the convict.  In the opening credits, someone is credited for the ""creature design"" I think it was.  I'm not sure I'd want that credit.  Regular zombies or aliens would've been better.

Upon rewatching this flick, I was forced to notice how silly certain moments or aspects of the movie are especially towards the end.  That doesn't stop this film from having it's own special situation that sets it aside from junky horror films.  Also, this film looks really good on screen.  It's very possible this movie could have been taken to a bigger level but I'd be lying if I said I could think of how they'd have done that.  I'd give this movie 4 stars easily if not for a few silly aspects (mostly a very COLD scene towards the end which was devastatingly dumb) and it's even a bit tough to watch the main characters in love being that the girl (Jill Wagner from Wipeout surprisingly) is so amazing looking and the guy (I enjoy watching him in general) is so unmatched with her beauty.

And why is the camera shutter so slow that its completely blurred? I mean we already know the monster looks stupid & fake, so why try to hide it? They made a movie that is purposely filmed & edited in such a way to make it unwatchable. They should have named it Splinter fail.

 There's a lot of things bad about this movie, and the kinky haired phd got under my skin first & last. Still I gave it 2 stars because I like how the propane tanks blow up. That 5 seconds of the movie reminded me of "" Dawn of the Dead "". But every other part of Splinter kind of sucked.

It was a Prime freebie.  Figures.  Three stars because it has a lot of good stuff, but it's just frustrating to see dummies stand there and get eaten.",1480550400,,326,4.4576271186440675
3651463,3,B001J4E19C,"I watched the first five minutes, then skipped ahead another 20 because it looked like pointless backstory that any idiot could understand via context later on. Maybe I was wrong and those 20 minutes were actually the best part of the movie. Hmm, maybe not knowing is actually the best part. By that logic, this movie would have continued to potentially be the greatest movie ever if I hadn't seen any of it. So I guess I ruined it by unnecessarily watching it. Sorry. I owe you one star for that.

Four, I mean three people get trapped in a gas station in the middle of nowhere with a Thing trying to kill them. It's every movie that it kinda sounds like, better than some but nowhere near as good as the best ones. The Crazies is a better movie. The Thing is a much better movie. That one where the old lady gets possessed and verbally abuses the pregnant waitress before scuttling around like a demon spider on the ceiling of at the diner in the middle of nowhere... well, that scene is better than any scene in this movie, but on the whole that movie isn't any better than this one.

So you've probably enjoyed worse movies than this. It's pretty uninspired, but at least it's well-polished - no artsy indie character/setting/twists, just a blandly attractive piece of cliche with some moldy spikes sticking out of it. If you were channel surfing in the middle of the night and this happened to be on, you wouldn't necessarily stop, not until you got to the end of the channel lineup and realized there wasn't anything better. This movie beats watching the second half of the edited-for-TV version of Revenge of the Nerds 2: Nerds in Paradise. That's worth a star right there.

Everybody did their job. Thank you all for making a movie that wasn't so bad that it made me angry. That's more rare than it should be. Plus, I watched it for free and didn't feel like I still paid too much. That's worth the third star.",1480550400,,1918,4.474285714285714

You have a person who is a Biologist working on his PHD and just seems to be the dumbest of the bunch. I didn't get that.

To sit there and try to figure out how to kill this organism while at the same time having the stupid idea of lighting the forest on fire to get help was just a way to prolong a relatively short movie.

W all had it in our head, while they were at a gas station with more than enough fuel or ligher fluid and lighters to burn down the whole forest but the Biologist has a great idea hey how about this we just lower my body temp, since it only senses heat  and which took a while, I could become invisible to the thing out there run to the police car and radio for help. Rather than hey lets just set the damn thing on fire, like in the movie the thing, which will be much quicker than lowering your damn body temp.

I just couldn't help but think that the whole time and not once have they even thought about it while lighting cigs, fire crackers, or the thought of setting the forest on fire.

3651673,3,B001J4E19C,"This film does its job well, and if you like the genre you'll probably enjoy it. But there is one overarching flaw, which I found so egregious and annoying that I was compelled to write a review and doc two stars...

The basic camera work is straightforward and traditional, unnoticeable (in a good way), and the filming should absolutely not be anything to remark upon in a film like this. But, as I said, that description only applies to the ""basic"" camera work, which only accounts for, perhaps, 50% of the run time. The rest of the time, the camera suffers continuously from tremors and spasms in varying degrees of severity. It's the filmic effect originally inspired by the signature look of hand-held camera work, which does have its place as an alternative to the fixed camera. But the severity of the shaking and wobbling you'll see here could only evoke handheld camera work if an epileptic cameraman were in the throes of a grand mal siezure. Or riding a dirt bike on a motor cross track.

Even more annoying is when you realize that these cinematic fits correspond *exactly* to the amount of special effects in the scene. If a character suffers from a wound-causing injury, you should be prepared for a visual earthquake. That wound requires serious make-up effects, which this film has decided, must never be shown directly. Is a scary creature about to appear? Brace yourself for nauseating herky-jerky-ness. This pattern is so consistent that I found it impossible not to come up with some hypothesis to explain it. One imagines the director had absolutely no confidence in the abilities of the special effects/make-up team. Maybe they really were incompetent (you can't really tell because you can't look at their work long enough to judge it). Maybe they were often frustrated and asked the director to bail them out: ""ugh, dude, I really messed up the oozing on this onethe blood isn't runny and the slime is cloudymake sure you really shake it up so nobody notices...""",1477008000,,1987,4.8240469208211145

3651717,4,B001J4E19C,"Splinter was a suggested watch by Amazon Video, and being Halloween month I figured I'd give it a watch. I had no expectations going into it and enjoyed this quick horror fix. I intentionally didn't read the plot and pre-judged it based solely on the thumbnail and rating. Four stars is a decent mark so it passed the screening process.

Splinter tells the story of a good couple and a bad couple. They wind up having a run-in with each other when suddenly, they have to fend off... something. That something ""monster"" is a bit of an interesting concept and I won't say any more about it. Parts of the movie tries to be different and parts fall into cliche category, but overall it was a good watch.

The movie is above average for an independent film with good acting by all the players. My only critique is whenever the ""monster"" shows up, the editing and the camerawork go haywire. I understand that it's done for effect, but here it was probably done because they didn't have the budget to show what they needed to show properly so the editing and camera are all over the place. That's the only reason I took off a star. I think with a bigger budget they would be able to accomplish a lot more.

3651778,4,B001J4E19C,"I picked this movie at random off of Amazon Prime, I love checking out random horror films that Ive never heard of before. I wasn't really expecting too much out of this one, I sort of expected that it would end up being some low budget B movie thatd I turn off after 10 minutes because it was so poorly done. Not the case with this movie!

It took about 10 minutes before I really got into this movie, and then I couldn't really look away. It has some interesting looking gore, and a few images that you don't really see that often in horror films. The acting was well done and believable. I really liked the special effects of the creature, super creepy images thatll stick in my mind.

All in all, this one is worth checking out if you're an avid fan of the Horror genre. Its definitely a movie Ill be wanting to purchase.

It kept me entertained for a little over an hour.  It is miles ahead of a majority of the films you'll find in Amazon's 'prime' horror library.  It's not on par with a 4 or 5 star film but it's not in found footage format.  It doesn't rely on nudity to get you to watch and it actually tries to tell a story.

The main drawback is that the 'creature' looks like something out of a 80's horror flick.  If you can get past that, you're fine.",1475712000,,571,4.09009009009009

I don't expect much from B-movies but Splinter had some pretty harrowing scenes in it once it really gets going about a half hour in. The effects are decent with minimal CGI, the characters evolve organically and while not much story, there's just enough to get you vested.

If i had to put one knock against it, is the last 15 minutes is pretty meh and can tell they had run out of budget. On the other hand, most horror movies with big budgets don't know how to end a movie either so I'll call that a wash. Everything leading up til that point is rather well done. It's about the journey, not the destination. Treat yourself to a creepy little surprise flick.",1475539200,,716,4.383458646616542
3651792,4,B001J4E19C,"It's not worth 4 stars, but worth more than 3. It's a survivalist type genre. I just watched again, but I remember watching it years ago. It's a really good concept about how an organism working on instinct to survive, like a virus or as stated in the movie, mold. So the mold has the ability to animate the animals it infects and that's its vector of infecting others. Think something like a virus that coops the human brain and then uses it to survive, in an instinctual way.  Viruses already have the ability to affect our moods, as in when we get sick, we feel ""bad"" as in uninterested in our normal daily lives or even depressed. Like I said, a good concept.

A trailer trash couple on the lam are fleeing the police after a robbery in which they kill a man.  Robber and his junkie  GF car jack a yuppie couple celebrating their wedding anniversary.  Wife is a go getter and hubby seems like a real putz.  While in the road they run over a nasty creature that blows out a tire, damages their water coolant system and gives robber a nasty hand injury with its ""Splinters"".  All four end up having to stop at the gas station from hell.  A mini mart that has already been infected by the Splinters.  And things get worse from their.  Interesting change in group dynamics, and proof that you can never judge a book by it's cover.  Basic no fluff script that gets you engaged with each character,  well acted.

Trapped by something, body snatching, criminal redemption, some that would be spoilerish of me to say, and im sure a few i missed. That combined with the archetypal characters, who all start out unlikable, and only one becomes more likable, would have you thinking this is just garbage. You would be right to make that assumption but wrong about the movie in my opinion. Once the main plot kicked in, and the special effects team went to work, i was pretty impressed. Not only by the quality of the effects, which appear to be all practical, but the originality. Yea they do some wobble cam and low lighting but it was acceptable because it was the best way to showcase this creature. I doubt the budget was huge and it was practical effects. Id rather see great glimpses of a good monster than full view of a bad one. Unfortunately i can only give it three stars because of everything else, but the creature is four star and the effects team is a solid five star.",1473465600,,1015,4.551912568306011

The only aspect of the movie that does get slightly old is that after the beginning, the rest of the movie occurs in one place.  I'm not slamming just this movie for this as I've found many movies that remain in one location for the entire film have to work really hard to keep your attention there (the movie called 'ATM' comes to mind as an extreme case of this.)

Basic plot is a couple is kidnapped by another couple, end up at a gas station where a weird, unknown creature is. Where it comes from or what it is is never fully explained but if you pay close attention at the beginning of the film a sign gives a slight clue as to what may have caused it. The creature effects are very well done, as a matter of fact the effects in general including the gore were well done. Speaking of gore, this film is very gory & bloody in places. The actors do a good job, especially Shea Whigham as one of the kidnappers, he is simply great. Makes you hate him at first then root for him later.

3651840,4,B001J4E19C,"Seth Belzer and Polly Watt (Paulo Costanzo and Jill Wagner), are a young, charming couple celebrating their anniversary and vacationing in the ancient forests of Oklahoma where the intellectual Seth spends most of his time blabbing about the age of trees and the incredibly gorgeous Polly discusses making love under the stars. Anyhow, they are car jacked by 2 escaped convicts, Dennis (Shea Whigham) and his rather charmless (character not the actress), drug addicted girlfriend Lacey (Rachel Kerbs). When they experience an unexpected flat tire, they go to a nearby gas station that appears to be abandoned and where they soon discover a ferocious parasitic prickly life-form that is hell bent in devouring them. Trapped within the locked gas station, they are forced to play a game of ""Survivor"" and must find a way to outplay, outwit and outlast the ever evolving predator or they too will become its prey.

Directed by Toby Wilkins (""The Grudge 3""), ""Splinter"" is a not-so-original monster movie but technically well-made and provides just enough suspense and gore to elevate this above others in the genre. Be warned despite this not being an annoying ""found footage"" feature, there is a lot of quick, jolting, shaky camera work and this may become irritating and give you a bit of a headache and the thorny fiend is shown a lot, but we never really get a good look at it; depending on the viewer, this is a either a positive or a negative. For me, it is a positive. There is nothing more annoying than showing your less than perfect monster too much. Unless they are spectacular to behold like the refined, glistening xenomorphs in the ""Alien"" franchise, other, less polished looking monsters deserve to be given some mystery. Too much screen time takes away from their mystique and at times, it unmasks its flaws. We do see several aspects of its gruesome, constantly changing appearance (it is a doozy) and its grisly, slimy work is in constant display. At times, the film did remind me of 2 remakes, John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) and Chuck Russell's ""The Blob"" (1988), however this picture moves at a faster, swifter pace. Another big positive for me is that the film does not rely too heavily on CGI. Most of the effects, make-up look like they were done old-school and are very effective. This is evidence enough that good practical effects and gore can still be used successfully in modern horror when done right.

The performances are good. Characters range from terribly unlikable (the 2 convicts) to likeable (the 2 sweethearts). They are all well acted despite some scene being terribly over-the-top and some of the dialogue a bit ridiculous, but then again, this is a monster movie, so toss logic out the window. The gore is great and although it is here in abundance, it is not overdone. For those looking to waste a good 82 minutes on a slightly above average monster movie, this is a good option. Just grab your popcorn, sit back and enjoy. ""Splinter"" isn't exactly ground-breaking, but it is a fast-paced, well-crafted creature features that delivers the gooey goods.

The DVD includes several extras, mostly of which I have not seen yet. Call me lazy but unless I am watching my all-time favorite movies, I usually do not pay attention to these extras - commentaries, documentaries, etc. But that's just me. For those that crave this sort of thing, dig in as this DVD features a nice assortment of bonus materials. There are commentaries from the cast, crew, the Director; a featurette ""The Splinter Creature"" (interesting but brief), a Creature Concept Art Gallery, and it even has instructions (provided by the sexy Jill Wagner) on how to make a Splinter pumpkin and more. For horror film fans, the film is worth owning with or without all of these extra's.

3651850,5,B001J4E19C,"Easily, one of the best horror films of 2014. The movie does a pretty good job making all of the characters ( a small cast) believable to the point that you pull for them when things go to heck (one character starts very unlikable but still is acted quite well). The special FX are quite good, mixing what look to be practical effects and CGI. In addition to some strategic edits and camera angles that make it trickier to make out the creatures (that are moving very quickly and are reminiscent of things out of John Carpenter's The Thing).

It starts out with a young couple driving along a country road at night when they get a flat tire.  While out changing the tire they come across another couple that do not have the best intentions in mind plus the reason for the flat tire was an animal on the road with some type of splinter / parasite on it.  You might think that the movie would be about a battle between the two couples and in a small way it is but the two couples must start to work together to battle the parasite or they all may die a horrific death.  Once these splinters touch another living thing, person or animal, they become a zombie like host to the parasite with some side effects that you would not wish on your worst emeny.

Now, for the overall production , story and plot of the movie, in my opinion was great! However, the only problem I had with the movie Splinter is the profanity; if the producer had just kept the f--- bombs out of the script that would have made a lot better. The fact, that I had to turn volume down real low so that my 6 year who likes to watch scary movies with me wouldn't have listen to all cursing; other than that it's a real good movie. The special effects that put in the movie was really good, especially scene (well, I bet not spoil the movie for you), just watch the movie and you see for yourself how good it is.

The direction is also very good, creating a good rhythm and crafting real narrative drive.  There are some genuinely scary sequences for which I suppose I should also credit the editor.

On a second viewing, though, I found myself smacking my head at how stupidly these characters behaved.  Eventually the mounting stupidity cheapens the story, which could have been much stronger.

3651905,2,B001J4E19C,"This movie could have been so much better if the acting hadn't of been very disjointed and hard to believe. I can see the actors exhibiting emotions but it often seems forced or contrived at times. Now of course the dialogue isn't great to begin with and put any actor into a situation with horrible dialogue, they will probably seem pretty bad. So i certainly understand. I guess i may just be used to screaming crying people and call me old fashion but i think if i saw this kind of thing coming at me i'd be crapping my pants whenever it showed up.

The type of monster just doesn't seem to mesh with the kind of responses the characters gave. I guess not everyone handles stress the same way, but it was hard to tell from the actors performances who they really were. Not much back story makes it seem like just another simple set up of a couple of people meet someone bad and then they get stuck together fighting something even more bad. Add to that the scene in the cooler where they get all warm and cozy with their human attacker and you just don't feel the movie should be going into subplots when it really has anything but. It would have been much better if they stuck with the original plot but made it more realistic.

The monster is pretty good however. The special effects are certainly good and it leads me to think that this movie was made just to put some design studio on the map. The script feels as if it were written solely as a means to demo the intricate design of the monster.

The actors were great and the story was consistent. You didn't get confused and the explanation of how the monster ticks was believable...for a movie of course. If you're into horror movies so much then you should give this one a chance because you know you've seen less worthy stuff so why not just watch one more. It could end up being the best horror movie you've seen in a long time and could even become your favorite like me. Don't miss out.,1364515200,,720,4.262773722627737
3651907,4,B001J4E19C,"Splinter follows a young couple, celebrating their anniversary, that get kidnapped by an escaped convict and his drug-addicted girlfriend. After the car overheats, they end up at a gas station where they face off against a parasite that infects its victims through its splinters. Splinter is a great gorefest monster flick.

Splinter has a simple story. This is positive, in a way, because it gets straight to the action after it briefly introduces the characters; however, it's also slightly negative because we never get much backstory on the parasite/monster. The infected look amazing and creepy thanks to the stunning special effects. The special effects are also great on the gore, and this film has a lot; bodies being cut in half, walking hands, and an arm getting cut off with a box cutter are a just a sample of what this film offers. The film uses gore, jump-scares, and tension to create an amazing horror film. The acting was great, as well.

The Blu-Ray of this film comes with a single blu-ray disc (no DVD or digital copy). The picture and sound quality are great, and this disc does come with plenty of special features, including a short but interesting feature that explains how they shot it digitally and the challenges that accompanied the shooting.

Overall, Splinter is an amazing and often overlooked horror film, with amazing special effects and an authentic horror atmosphere. I recommend a purchase for horror fans, a rental otherwise.

And I will even give thumbs up to a movie even if it has only 10 minutes of goodness for 70 minutes of blah blah (but not ridiculously bad).  This movie, Splinter, sucks.  It's boring through and through.  No real tension and only about 10 seconds of a good part (not worth seeing the movie for).

How do I base my star rating?  I have friends over to watch horror movies.  Last night was my night to pick.  I picked this movie.  The way my movie group works is that you get to pick until your pick bombs.  Because of this movie I don't get to pick for at least another five weeks.  I can't even say this movie sucked... it didn't irritate enough.  It was just blah, there, boring.  So I give this 2 stars b/c movies like The Witch of Pine Barrens (Blair Witch stole this movie) is by far better.

3651909,5,B001J4E19C,"Okay, this one came out of nowhere. ""Splinter"" is just terrific for what it is: a low-budget indie horror film. Definitely a new twist on ""XYZ Monster in the Woods"" movies. It's better than The Hills Have Eyes, Joyride, Cabin in the Woods, Last House on the Left, etc because it actually succeeds in tethering itself to reality. Real characters with real deficiencies and phobias are put into a nearly impossible situation.

This movie was exceptionally cast as well. The brainiac ""Luke, PhD"" doesn't overplay his role or come across as being 'too' intelligent. The 'strong-willed heroic girlfriend' character isn't 'too' heroic or strong-willed; but the character that takes the award for best-cast is the hillbilly hick murderous kidnapping bad guy, who ends up being the most sympathetic character in the entire movie and who shows just enough emotional restraint to succeed in playing his role.

I love these situational horror films: Perfect Getaway, Joyride, The Ruins; none of them are big budget blockbusters; and this movie has more cool twists than all the others. The production values are also truly amazing for a three-actor indie low-budget film.

Insanely great!

3651942,4,B001J4E19C,"A suspense movie more than anything. The was some gore but not a lot of it.
The commentary fills in a lot of ""why would it do that!?""s you might have. I haven't read the low rating reviews but if I hadn't listened to the commentary, I'd probably give it a 3 stars. The thing about commentary is they can tell you what and why a creature does things that simply cannot be covered in the movie. So if you end up making the wrong assumption about something in the movie or get caught up on a ""that doesn't make sense!"" about one thing that carries through the rest of the flick, it can ruin it. Plus, they go over how they did a lot of the effects. The use of ferrofluid was pretty inspired.
The plot line being something got dug up and let loose recently via an oil drilling company. A couple fleeing to the border meets up with a couple on vacation in a bad way. They stop at a gas station to get gas and run into a victim of said thing, spending the rest of the movie trying to survive and escape it.
It's much better than I was expecting. Some of the effects were very well done, or at the least, done in a way that was interesting to see. The characters had their moments of stupidity and brilliance.
I've seen much much worse. The only thing that harms the movie, imo, are the couple of poorly done cgi shots of the monster and those were fairly quick shots. The rubber suit scenes were acceptable for they were shot in a way it wasn't very obvious and since the critter ""absorbs"" things into itself, it isn't going to be something with clean lines. The only acting that bugged me was the girl tripping out near the beginning thinking what they hit was her old dead dog.",1336262400,,1673,4.198757763975156

3651949,4,B001J4E19C,"I bought this movie on a whim when I was browsing the horror section of a video store I found when on vexation and I was pleasantly surprised. This movie have a basic, but interesting plot, a good monster and rather good characters, this is an example of a indie horror film done right. Splinter is about a young couple who are kidnapped when they go on a camping trip to celebrate their anniversary. The kidnappers stop at a run down gas station in the middle of nowhere unaware that there lurks a monster in the shadows.

In one way Splinter is your typical survival horror, you have a group of people trapped in a location, in this case a gas station, and a blood thirsty monster trying to get at them. Splinter do stray from the normal course of the genre however by having relatively few deaths, there are plenty of gore here, but the film is more about atmosphere than kill count, something I like. The monster in this movie to is interesting it is a bit like The Thing had babies with a cactus. The interesting concept of the monster however get a bit marred by the fact that I do not think it was represented well on the screen. Now the movie in general is good quality but I was more impressed by the effects of the small monster parts than when you see the whole thing wandering about.

Splinter is a great little movie. I think the phasing could be better here and there, but all in all I am nitpicking here, I really did like this movie very much. If you like survival horror, zombies or freaky monsters then I recommend you check out Splinter, I do not think you would be disappointed.",1319068800,2,1598,4.34113712374582
3651950,3,B001J4E19C,"I give this movie 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon won't let me do that, I have to give it three because its shortcomings outweigh its strengths.

I was worried at the start of this film that it would be atrocious.  I based this on the brief glimpse we are given of the ""creature"" and the corniness of the opening scene in general.

The movie picks up from here as we meet the four main (and essentially only) characters in what must have been a shoestring budget of a film.  The characters are develop enough to be able to relate with (and tolerate) and then we go into the standoff at the gas station.  This is when we get a good look at the creature and I gotta say, for a low budget film, the ""monster"" is grotesque looking and the creature effects are disturbing, gory, and fun.

The execution of the standoff is effective and plays out in a (somewhat) believable fashion.  While the ending definitely needs a re shoot (especially for some of the silly dialogue) the overall movie works and we aren't presented with what could have been a rip off of The Thing (although we do get similar scenes, specifically the walking body parts).

Now for spoilers to explain my problems with the film:

First off, gotta bring up the ending and the way our ""PHD"" character plans to trick the monster in most illogical way imaginable.  I can only imagine everyone watching the film was dying to scream out ""JUST DO TREMORS 2 YOU DOLTS, WE CAN SEE THE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS!"", but alas they tried to be original and instead what they got was stupid.  For those who haven't seen Tremors 2, the movies have the same idea of the monster(s) seeing with heat vision.  So the characters in that film cover their bodies in clothing and then shoot themselves with a fire extinguisher to hide their body heat.  There is undoubtedly fire extinguishers at a gas station, likely more than one, so the fact that they went with the ""let's basically put me in a coma with ice"" idea over this was puzzling to say the least.  This is further hurt by the creature being aware that he's nearby anyway (although unable to exactly pinpoint his location).  In Tremors 2 the creatures are completely unaware of the characters sneaking by until their layer of frost melts, apparently the monsters heat vision in this film is much better as he isn't tricked at all, just a little confused.

Another problem with the film was some of the dialogue.  Personally I liked all of the characters.  They catch on to the ""monster"" problem right away (instead of it taking 3-4 deaths to figure it out like in many other monster films) and typically do things you'd expect them to do given the circumstances.  The problem is some of the dialogue is clunky and awkward.  The final lines of ""**** it"" by our ""badass"" anti hero just further hurts the movies ending but I gotta say making the creature a ""fungus"" based life form was a nice touch.

I recommend this film for the first hour plus, but don't expect to be blown away, just entertained.",1317427200,2,2991,4.512059369202226

Its just not a good movie.  The characters are annoying, especially the husband character.  I suppose you're suppose to be rooting for him to survive the ordeal, but honestly I was hoping he was going to be killed.  There were long drawn out scenes between the husband and wife, that I guess were suppose to be sincere and heartfelt, like when he was cooling his body temperature with ice, but I was so bored I fast-forwarded through all the dialouge.  The premise of this movie is pretty corny too.  And I felt like I was watching Tremors part 2 when they discovered the creatures are attracted to heat, therfore they needed to cool their bodies down.  I also found it pretty unbelievable how they amputated the one guy in the manner they did, and he seemed to be completely find 5 minutes later.  All in all this movie wasn't very enjoyable to watch.

3651957,3,B001J4E19C,"Splinter (2008) is an independently produced horror thriller, where the main characters are placed in a pressure cookerlike situation, barricaded inside a gas station. after they are attacked and forced to take refuge from a strange monster.

Biologist Seth Turner (Paulo Costanzo) and his girlfriend Polly (Jill Wagner) are only their way back after a camping trip, when they are hijacked by Dennis Farrell (Shea Whigham) and his girlfriend Lacey (Rachel Kerbs), who are armed and on the run from the law.  When their SUV runs over and animal, the group pulls over to change a tire, and Dennis receives a splinter wound in the finger.  Pulling into a service station, Lacy discovers the heaving body of an attendant in the toilet, with a large number of black splinters stuck in him.  She returns to the front of the station to warn Dennis, and is struck down and killed by the twisted, bloody mass of flesh, as the rest retreat inside the convenience store.

Most of the film takes place in the store, as the survivors try to figure out what the hell they are up against.  The splinter creatures take over the flesh of whatever they enter, be it animal or human, crunching bones and breaking joints.  The infected flesh of different creatures, can meld with each other to form one mass.  And parts of infected flesh, like severed hands, can act independently.  Use of CG special effects is kept to a minimum, and shaky hand-held camerawork and quick cutting, is used to make getting a good look at the monster near impossible.

What makes the film interesting, is the interaction and evolving dynamic of the three main characters, who unite as a team to survive.  Seth is an analytical intellectual type, who falters at physical tasks.  For a while, bending a coat hanger is a major physical achievement.  Polly is more antsy, and action oriented.  The real surprise is how Farrell transforms from a violent prick, into a sensitive, sympathetic and ultimately a tragic figure.

When the splinter beast begins to affect Farrell's arm, desperate and extremely brutal measures are taken.  Instead of bleeding out, Farrell has a miraculous near pain free recovery.  Strange choices are made, as when lighter fluid is poured out the back door of the building.  The most ridiculous ploy is Seth lowering is body temperature using ice, to make him hard for the creature to detect.  Then when it is time for him to save the day, he is barely able to move because he is so cold.  What kind of genius goes on a life or death mission with a thermometer in his mouth?  Seth makes a slight comeback from being a complete dweeb, but once again it is Farrell who has to man up and do what needs to be done.  The film ends with a pathetic Seth, still hobbling around.

For a film shot in just twenty days, Splinter has good production values, and director Toby Wilkins gets a lot done within the limited budget, particularly in the special effects department.  The screenplay has some questionable elements, but this kind of film isn't meant to be scrutinized too seriously.  The performances by the three principal actors is very strong.  Shea Whigham shows some good dramatic range and physical skills, while  Paulo Costanzo (Royal Pains, Joey) does a great job of being exactly the kind of wimp the script called for.

The DVD has a nice set of extras, including two pretty informative commentary tracks, one featuring Toby Wilkins and the principal cast, and a second with Wilkins and director of photography Nelson Cragg, and editor David Michael Maurer.",1284595200,,3545,4.786184210526316
3651958,4,B001J4E19C,"I went into this movie as I do most low-budget, indie horror movies - ZERO expectations.  This movie surprised me.  It is really good.  A good script, good actors, good effects (which are very little CG) and a very creative director.  I normally don't want to know anything about a movie going in, but heard basically the plot-line through a review.  It didn't matter.  I still enjoyed it.  I don't get the harsh reviews.

For a fun, Friday night popcorn muncher, this will fit the bill.  For those who want more, it will give you more.  There are quite a few extras.  A few featurettes and two commentaries.  I have only listened to the first commentary, with director and actors and liked it.  I have not heard the second one which covers the more technical aspects.  I will listen . . . just getting the time.  The director is extremely informative, clever and as I said before, very creative.  He does a lot on the cheap without it looking like it.  Not a bunch of awful CG but actual actors -- yes, in makeup and suits -- that will surprise you for quality.  The extra features explain that actors were used rather than CG along with why and how much better it made the movie.  It did.

My summary is this, that in the spectrum of movies, this isn't a five star classic.  But for someone who likes horror, and has had to deal with a lot of cheesy, lame, terrible films, I think you will really enjoy this.",1283472000,2,1410,4.366795366795367
3651979,3,B001J4E19C,"I came across this movie in the local library DVD section and decided to give it a shot.  Rarely am I treated to such an unknown pleasure, but this was a special case.  I'm not saying it was amazing, but you could do a lot worse with low budget indie-horror.  If movies like Black Christmas (which I regrettably gave my money to) can be a major release in theaters, this definitely deserved to be in theaters everywhere.  Upon research, Splinter did find its way to a limited release on Halloween in 2008.  Too bad it didn't come to Kansas City, because it could have made 5 dollars more on a weekday.

Anyways, Splinter is about a couple who decide to go camping for their anniversary but fail to properly set up a tent, so they decide on driving to a nearby cheap motel to spend their magical evening.  While driving to said motel, the lovers played, by Jill Wagner and Paulo Costanzo (High Times cover boy in Road Trip), run into another group of stranded lovers on the run.  As always, stopping to pick them up turns out to be a bad idea (shocker).  However, they all become stranded at a nearby gas station after their getaway car breaks down.  This gas station seems to be abandoned at first, but the attendant lurks outside taken over by a deadly virus.

Paulo Costanzo (Seth) almost has his Ph. D in Biology, so he is constantly analyzing this splinter parasite and tries to keep the group from doing anything too stupid throughout the film.  He plays the part of the nerdy, wimpy boyfriend very well but its tough to like him at first.  The best character in this movie is the criminal Dennis (Shea Whigham), who plays a bad guy at first, but becomes a very likable guy by the end.  The female lead isn't too bad either, making this a rare horror movie with good performances all around.

On to the production side of the film, they chose to use live creature effects and not CGI.  While Michael Bay might laugh at this insane notion, I heavily prefer it.  If necessary, using a little CGI doesn't bother me, but it can ruin a film when many death scenes are laughably fake.  An example would be the movie, The Midnight Meat Train.  Even though I enjoyed it a lot more than I anticipated, it suffered from overusing CG blood and gore.  It sort of shows me the director chose an easier way out of filming a scene, aka cheating or being lazy.  That being said, there was no computerized blood being shed in Splinter. Thank you Toby.

However, they did use a trick which I despise almost as much as CGI: shaky camera syndrome.  This is when the director gets up close and personal to the action and the camera moves so much its kind of hard to tell whats going on besides a bloody mess.  I get why they do this (to cover up shoddy effects), but it is somewhat disappointing.  Luckily, I only noticed this at the beginning a few times, so I either got used to it or they quit doing it.

Overall, I would recommend seeing this film over many indie-horror flicks you might find on the shelves of your local video store.  It has all the elements one could hope for in a quality horror film: good acting, believable effects, genuine scares, and realistic blood.  It's a shame it hasn't been seen by a wider audience.  This is most likely because it isn't a cookie cutter slasher film like most of the genre that makes it on the Silver Screen is.  Sure, not everyone will love every decision made in this movie, but its easy to say that while safely sitting on a couch drinking a beer.  All you need to do is just sit back and enjoy the ride, and you will be pleasantly surprised with Splinter.

I always read reviews before buying a new flick, but sometimes it is hard to tell if the movie is really good or not so good-maybe there are 7 reviewers, and one person is in a bad mood or is just a chowderhead or is scared of monsters or whatever-gives a bad score and the movie drops below a four. So, I am good at judging movies, especially in this genre. This creature is a bad nasty. It is fast, it is smart, and when it reanimates the gnarly, bloody, disfigured, mangled and twisted remains of one of its victims, it is a flailing mass of rapidly moving and almost comically (almost because it is too disgusting to actually be comical) persistent corpse-meat.

3651981,1,B001J4E19C,"I love Horror films and I'm always willing to spend a buck on titles that the mainstream skips over. Sometimes you find a GEM (checkout Dead Girl)and sometimes you get this.

I should straight off that I have no problem with the idea of the monster featured in this film matter of fact I think it was a great idea. What ruins the film are the characters and the sheer stupidity of everything they say and do.

With any horror movie it will fall into one of 2 categories. Category 1. is where you have an annoying cast and you root for the monster to kill them. Category 2. Is where you have a good cast and an annoying monster you can't wait for them to kill ... oh and Category 3. A good cast and a good monster that you want neither to die (rarity but best examples would be the Predator movies).

Within the first 5 minutes of the film you can tell that this is category 1. horror film. Your met with the most annoying couple known to mankind. Lady and the Idiot. The typical lovey dubby couple that you enjoy seeing killed off. You'll watch and wait for the monster to appear to kill them off quickly as it's introduced but it never happens...say hello to your main characters.

But wait! It get's better... next scene you get to meet backwoods reject and his strung out girlfriend. Guess what? Natural born killers they are not. Some scenes later the two couples meet something happens and they are now traveling together.
Great a car full of people you couldn't careless about. Lets hope they're brakes fail and they end up flying off a cliff. Wait... what just happened? They ran over something? Let's stop the car and find out what it was.

Some other scenes happen and Billybob the inbred decides to hand his firearm to his drugged out girlfriend who at this point is shown that she belongs in a mental hospital. Why give someone who's not in their right mind a gun? You tell me... some stuff happens and as you expect it stoner girl is tripping out and she has everyone freaked because she's aiming her gun at everyone...including Billybob who gave her the gun.

They get in the jeep and head down the road and unfortunately find themselves in dire need of a gas station. After drawing straws to see who will pump the gas and who will go buy a pack of cigarettes while Mary Jane goes to the bathroom some other events occur. Uh oh! looks like Mary Jane won't be needed to get high anymore. Yaay! first annoying character out the way. You look at your watch 40 minutes have gone by and there's only 3 minutes left of the film? How can this be you ask yourself it's only just starting and you haven't really even seen the monster or any action...

The next 30 minutes (more like 22 due to the longest credits in history)involve watching the most idiotic statements,ideas, and decisions you will ever see any make EVER in a horror movie. You will get to a point where you want no one to live. Where you just want them all to die... and if the monster doesn't do it you will do it yourself.

Some more stuff happens the movie is over you never get you wish. Your left trying to figure out what just happened,what was the point of the movie, what did I just watch,what else could I have watched,I feel like I was robbed I wonder if I can report this to the police,there goes the money I should have spent on beer, and oh gee...that movie was so short what did I just watch again?

Yes, that is pretty much Splinter. So If you think this movie is worth your time by all means waste it. Yes again fooled by Amazon reviews... well played... well played. This movie is shallow and predictable there's nothing worth 4 or 5 stars in it. The action is non existent, the actors are horrible, the special effects is CGI, and the monster idea while I liked it... I have seen it done better before in a much better movie.

How throw away titles like this get so many high rankings is beyond me. The story is everything you've seen before done worse. If you want to see a break through indie horror film with something you haven't seen watch something like Dead Girl.

This film didn't hold my interest for a slight second and while it still wasn't horrible it still would lose to those Sci-Fi and Chiller original movies. I rate this film 1 star because I wasn't entertained and I didn't find this film charming at all. Splinter is every ""trapped in a room"" horror movie you've ever seen except done worse. Considering it takes them 40 minutes to get to the Gas station where the story actually starts all I can say is that this movie is just a waste of your time. Do yourself a favor and go see an independent film that's worth watching not this ""CreepShow"" knockoff.",1281571200,4,4662,4.3656286043829295
3651982,4,B001J4E19C,"SPLINTER is an exciting new take on the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD scenario, where a group of strangers are forced to defend themselves from an onslaught of deadly creatures by holing up in a remote gas station. The offender this round is a carnivorous fungus that spreads by forming deadly barbs that infect living hosts, bonding with them and turning them into bloodthirsty killers! These infected creatures are truly terrifying, retaining their human form but in twisted and mangled forms that use their broken and contorted limbs as weapons. In the spirit of John Carpenter's THE THING, Toby Wilkins infuses the film with adrenaline-pumping thrills and impressive creature designs to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. In addition to the painful bone-snapping and bloody special effects, SPLINTER also includes a nauseating amputation sequence that can't help but get a reaction. This is one of the few recent creature-features to put a unique twist on familiar genre conventions, with bloody results!

There's a little bit of Stephen King's ""The Mist"", the 50s horror classic ""The Blob"" and many other ""in the dark"" nail-biters that has given horror its name...and addiction to fans like me.  ""Splinter"" is a must for horror fans.  It has it all...and I hope a sequel is in the works.  It won 6 ""Best Picture"" awards at the Screamfest (and rightfully so), and gets under your skin because the character development is at its best...you even warm up to the monsters, who have a mind of their own.  Don't miss it.  I gave it all 5 stars.  Get ready for a true monster thrill ride!",1272240000,,846,4.435064935064935
3651986,5,B001J4E19C,"What we have here, is an independent film with very good acting... great special effects( without the ""offensive"" CGI), and a cool story line, that seems realistic...as far as it's characters. Splinter had a terrific atmosphere... it wasn't neccessarily scary, but it was suspenseful, and the fact that the creature wasn't defined was cool too...it was more about how the creature took over a body was what made it brilliant. I was engaged throughout the film, and it kept me glued the whole time. The characters interactions were not at all over the top..or extra, i totally dug their dynamics, and their trying to figure what the hell to do... It is such a shame that these are the type of films that excel over those major hollywood attempts, of gore and barbie doll actors, that we are subject too. Over the last several years, i have been investing time and chance with films like this...and feel totally rewarded after viewing them. Splinter is a gem...polished and refined....thank goodness for film makers, actors, writers, fx artists and directors who put their energy into projects like this...!!!",1271376000,,1107,4.956989247311828

I liked the first showing of the monster/splinter thing, however, they did not really show a glimpse of the thing for the rest of the film.

3651990,2,B001J4E19C,"At heart, SPLINTER is a pretty interesting concept for a movie.  Two couples end up stranded in the middle of nowhere and suddenly encounter a mindless and blood-thirsty organism that has a unique way of getting under your skin.  Unfortunately, the only parts of this movie that have any draw at all are the ones that fully showcase this concept - when the audience is treated to an unobstructed view of this creature really giving it all its got.

The script follows your standard horror formula without much straying.  There's about fifteen minutes of character development, during which we learn that one couple is comprised of a mouth-breathing wimp who is dating a spunky hottie that is way out of his league, while the other couple is comprised of a no-nonsense alpha male and a sickly pale woman with a talent for delusional whining.  Shortly after these two meet up, they meet the organism, and the film turns into a standard creature feature.

What does that entail?  Well, it's fairly low-budget, so in lieu of visually arresting scares, there is some annoyingly frenetic camera work that leaves a whole lot of guess work up to viewers.  There's a lot of pointless and unbelievable speculation about the creature (watch as Mr. Mouth Breather goes from calmly observant scientist to whimpering baby in a matter of seconds).  The group bonds in unlikely ways and at unlikely moments (check out the pointless pow wow that goes on after the gruesome freezer scene).  Why, there's even a heavy-set female cop who refuses to display any kind of competence at all.

I wasn't too impressed by any of this, nor was I particularly bummed out.  It was following a well-worn trail in the lexicon of horror, and although that doesn't make it very creative, that trail is well-worn for a reason.  Unfortunately, I'm talking about pure story.  The dialogue and the acting are ultimately what ruin this film.  Only the spunky hottie seems like a real person.  The two males undergo radical personality changes that are meant to show us how a crisis can bring out the best in people (I guess), but it played like pure schlock in the hands of these fairly dull actors.  Cap the whole thing off with an emotionally cheap (and slightly abortive) ending, and you're left with a flavorless film that still manages that have a nasty aftertaste.",1267142400,2,2331,4.802005012531328
3651991,3,B001J4E19C,"Three people hunker down in a rural gas station to fend off attacks by grossly disfigured re-animated corpses. While what is responsible for the ""Zombification"" is never detailed, splinters of wood from the nearby forest carry the contagion. The special effects are extremely well done, though the camera work prevents the viewer from getting a clear, prolonged glimpse of the ""creature"". This shaky, drop frame editing style of cinematography has been worked to death, (though it was reasonably well done here). Although the producers claim this is a creature feature, SPLINTER is arguably a novel entry into Zombie cinema, (minus the flesh munching). While I did not warm to the characters, the level of acting displayed was competent and with a better script, we may even have witnessed some stellar performances. The cast played it straight and there were some genuine thrills along the way, (though I would have preferred to see more kills). All in all this was a satisfying indie horror effort. The Canadian DVD edition features superior keep-case artwork, and blows the U.S. edition away. Overall, a solid three or more stars. Recommended.",1266796800,,1146,5.166666666666667
3651992,2,B001J4E19C,"""Splinter"" is an obscure, indie flick that I probably never would've heard about if not for my interest in the indie horror genre. It was praised by others for its fresh appeal in a subgenre of overused CGI and tiring monsters.

Like most of the films I seek out, I have a rather high standard set. I need to stop doing this to myself. Time after time I'm disappointed. I can agree this movie had clever, unique creature design (akin to the Flood in the Halo series, actually) that has awesome and practical killing/infection methods. The effects were indeed convincing and CGI free (with one exception at the end) which was the movies biggest plus. The bad side to the deformed, spiked creature is that we never get a clear shot at it. During the action sequences the camerawork is frantic. This effect for me was ineffective. The 'shaky cam method' has been hit (enhanced ""REC"" to a terrifying spectacle) or miss (""Cloverfield... 'Nuff said) for me and depends on the film's strength elsewhere whether it succeeds or flops. The creature was one of the film's only strong-points and the camerawork hindered that.

The script in ""Splinter"" is (unintentionally) laughable (""It's okay. It's okay. We're cutting off your arm""). The dialogue was weak in the beginning and didn't engage me with a single character (not one!) and the latter half the script was nonsensical and unrealistic -- and not in the Takeshi Miike sense. For example (*spoilers*) after the amputation scene (which features no blood?) the trio sit around laughing and carrying on like old friends despite one of their appendages being freshly bludgeoned off with a cinder-block. (*end spoilers*)

All three characters are too carbon-copied for my liking. We have the wimpy, indoorsy guy who struggles throughout but shines through, mans up, and becomes the hero. We have the tough-as-nails, in-yo-face chick who wears the pants in the relationship. And for good measure they threw in the disgruntled villain who warms up, being a ""really nice guy"" on the inside and redeems himself in a blaze of valiance. Bleck. Urp. Excuse me... I just vomit in my mouth a little bit.

A lot of scenes were unnecessary and stupid, pointless attempts to add suspense or tension (the whole 'ice' scene and the scene following the ice scene in the car) and I was just not buying any of what ""Splinter"" was selling.

In addition, and this is plain silliness, the cover design sucks and makes it look like some suspense/drama starring Julia Roberts (aka ""Sleeping with the Enemy). Check out the Canadian DVD case -- it's 100x better.

For my conclusion I may be judging ""Splinter"" a little tough, but due to the glowing reviews it got I was expecting something great. The two people I watched it with said it was `decent' and at the end of the day I cannot imagine it being any more than that.

3651993,4,B001J4E19C,"Splinter was one of the best horror movies I've seen in awhile. It's a low budget movie that didn't get the publicity it deserved in 08. It has interesting creatures which seem believable in that world, and the characters are very realistic. The same solutions I came up with to a problem at least one of the characters did too. The acting is also really. I would definitely suggest you purchase this film. It is worth watching.",1263686400,,428,4.571428571428571
3651994,5,B001J4E19C,"This more-than-meets-the-eye little ""monster movie"" isn't just an excellent piece of horror fiction that will actually scare without resorting to cheap montages of girls being tortured to death, it is a master class in how to make a REALLY scary movie with little or no money.

The ""monster"" is similar to the one in THE RUINS (which, by contrast, is a master class in how NOT to make something scary or even interesting) but, again, this takes that theme and runs with it, putting its unlucky protagonists into an increasingly dire situtation that never once feels forced or contrived.

While others are attempting to rewrite the book on horror films with so-called torture porn, SPLINTER follows the rules and scores an unbroken series home runs without either effort or cheap tricks.

There just isn't a wrong or false note to be had in this thing. It's that good.

 I cannot over-praise this film.

My friends and I were excited to see this, but at the end of the movie, everyone just kept saying how cheesy and dumb it was, and what a waste of our time was. I DEFINITELY don't recommend this movie! Please people! For your own sake, save your money for something more worth it.",1257724800,2,407,4.1645569620253164
3651996,2,B001J4E19C,"Once again, we have a horror film that's big on special effects and lacking in storyline. It's like a piece of fried chicken that's mostly batter. Taste great, less filling. It's not even very scary -- movies generally aren't when the monster is always in your line of sight (and have glaring Achilles' heels to boot). Frankly, the special effects aren't even that good if that's all you care about. Most of the time, the crew could be shaking a monster-sized mass of oily rags under a flickering fluorescent lamp, what with the herky-jerky quick edits that make the fungus-fueled beasts nearly impossible to comprehend. The acting is decent; the characters are generally believable (except for the escaped convict's ""heart of gold"" tale).

But back to the storyline (WARNING: SPOILER COUNTRY AHEAD!). It starts out so great, too, with two genres coming together in seemingly clever fashion -- crime drama and horror flick -- like peanut butter and chocolate. A guy on the run with his drug-addled girl toy hijacks a vacationing couple's SUV and kidnaps them, apparently so he doesn't have to drive. The action unfolds in an old-growth Oklahoma forest (sounds like paradise!) where there is some ongoing oil extraction taking place that has apparently dug up some ancient spores with the ability to resurrect dead flesh and make it thirst for living flesh. Of course, this isn't the official line; Mr. Almost Ph. D. (the boyfriend without a prison stint) has discovered that this psycho mold just feeds off things that have high temperatures -- leading to a lame joke involving kissing, as well as one host organism that launches itself at an overheated car like it's a long-lost lover and, inexplicably stays there long after the ""love affair"" has cooled off. Speaking of which, how is it possible this dead body in its car hood embrace would be overlooked by the police officer who shows up to bag the escaped prisoner? And since when do firecrackers give off less heat than humans? I'm sure I'm leaving out some inconsistencies, but you get the idea.

If the action had been funnier -- like when the cop shows up and you just know she's going to be turned into a pin-cushion contortionist and everybody and their grandmother is telling her to get back into her squad car -- I might still have been able to recommend this film. After all, with a nod to John Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" there ARE some good special effects and the makeup is above par. But the unfolding of events is generally dull, mainly consisting of reanimated flesh running into glass barriers and the characters showing off their lame survival skills. Eventually, the whole mismatched jigsaw fizzles out, with the one-armed frenemy muttering, ""F**k,"" over and over like he forgot his lines, but more likely because he realized the production budget had hit a wall, which would explain what is probably the least explosive gas station fireball in the history of color film.",1257033600,,2942,4.882
3651997,4,B001J4E19C,"SPLINTER is that rare modern horror film: a creature feature supported by an interesting idea and solid acting.  It revolves around a simple, novel idea: three people--an escaped convict and the vacationing couple he's taken hostage--stuck inside a gas station, while a parasitic monstrosity tries to get in.

That's not to say SPLINTER is the perfect horror movie; it revolves around the coincidences that plague the horror genre (one of the hostages just happens to be a biology doctoral candidate?  Really?), and features one of those pat endings that infuriates me to no end.  But the movie revels in its independent status (the special effects are delightfully cheap, the set small, the cast list consisting of, I believe, six people total), and manages to keep its running time short, under 90 minutes--the perfect length for this kind of film.  SPLINTER doesn't break any new ground, but it's an interesting, engaging horror film that stands out from its peers on the market today.",1256342400,,988,5.074074074074074
3651998,4,B001J4E19C,"You always have to go the independent route it seems to find the more interesting horror films. If you were to judge from the opening moments of Splinter you might not make it through the film. The opening as it is involves visually what looks like a man being violated by a badger. Then you get into the main character story of actors that fall straight into their cliches from the nerdy scientist boyfriend played by Paulo Costanzo, his tough wilderness oriented girlfriend, and the hardened criminal who takes them hostage with his drug addled girlfriend. The cons spend too much time dropping the f-bomb and the film doesn't work.
Until everyone gets to the gas station and gets trapped inside the tight little set of a rural gas station with a creature outside fighting them to get in. The director Toby Wilkins in my opinion has made an amazingly tense little creature feature with an interesting monster in the form of parasitic splinters that take over the bodies of creatures they inhabit. The film as it is is intense survival horror with characters fighting to survive compounded by things like bodies that might not be dead and a lack of help. I liked the idea of a single set which is used to great effect by Wilkins and all the actors do good at never becoming annoying, especially Shea Whigam, a character actor who makes a good hero in the escaped convict. If theres one complaint against the movie it would be in the use of shaky combat cam. I can understand why its used here and thankfully its done better than in the recent Pandorum hiding problems with visual effects but the jerky editing and images still aren't a favorite film aspect of mine as I like to sometimes see what I'm supposed to be afraid of.
Still the movies a lot of fun for those who enter with the right expectations. Theres some gore, some violence but a lot of suspense that should have it. For the DVD Magnolia again steps forward and delivers a good disc with featurettes on aspects of the film, a making of that is disappointingly short and an engaging commentary from the director and cast.

The monster was very well done especially considering the budget this movie had to work with which just goes to show that sometimes a little creativity and imagination can meet and even surpass those films with much higher budgets to work with.  Also, when it comes to the victims of the monster in this movie the effects were bone chilling.. or actually.. bone snapping and brutal and again surpassed expectations considering the budget.  This film is a must have for any fan of horror as so much of it was just done right.",1251072000,16,903,4.732484076433121
3652001,4,B001J4E19C,"2008 was an excellent year for the horror genre.  I'm not talking about the big budget Hollywood spewage, like The Strangers, The Eye, The Ruins, or Saw V.  I'm referring to inventive, classic-style brutality that was shamelessly ignored by the studios and mainstream audiences.  Independent films with unrestricted, heinously morbid films with fear-inducing imagery that makes you shudder.  Plus uncompromising foreign stuff that will constantly simmer in the back of your mind and give you recurring nightmares.  Great movies like INSIDE, EDEN LAKE, LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, ORPHANAGE, MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN, FRONTIER(S), MOTHER OF TEARS, [REC], TEETH, and my personal low-budget favorite GUTTERBALLS.  Man, those are to die for, in a good way.

Splinter is another excellent addition to that list.  It opens with a bit of a jolt.  A gas station attendant gets viciously mauled by an apparently rabid animal.  Although this immediately grabs your attention, I thought it was an unneccessary plot device aimed at hooking the ADD crowd.  Develop the story first, then go for scares.

Next the story shifts toward a young couple headed for a romantic camping trip.  When they get car-jacked by an escaped convict and his junkie girlfriend, I started to fear the worst.  This seemed to be forming another threadbare, banal, cookie-cutter, cheap & irritating imitation of horror.  Luckily, there's more here than we've come to expect.

I won't give away too much about the upcoming developments.  I suggest going into this movie blind.

The four people start to get hunted by something extremely peculiar.  There seems to be a parasite of some sort that uses its lifeless mangled victims to attack and feed on other prey.

3652003,4,B001J4E19C,"Splinter is an indie horror movie inspired by John Carpenter's The Thing and Sam Raimi's Evil Dead II.  Like any good horror film, Splinter achieves the right balance to terrify its protagonists: 1) psychological tension between the characters, 2) isolation, and 3) a creature. This review contains minor splinters--I mean spoilers.

On the surface, our happy couple and soon-to-be-victims Seth Belzer (Paulo Costanzo, last seen on the failed Friends spin-off Joey) and Polly Watt (Jill Wagner, who took Jessica Biel's place in the Blade television series) plan to camp out in the woods for a romantic evening.  The in-joke is that they are the reverse of a typical horror couple: Seth is a wussy botany student and Polly is a rugged outdoorswoman.  Unfortunately, this difference is a little too extreme - Polly seems too sexy for a guy like Seth.

Another couple is thrown into the mix, and this is where the parallels between Evil Dead and Splinter begin. Dennis Farrell (Shea Wigham) is a convict on the run with his junkie girlfriend Lacey Belisle (Rachel Kerbs).  They hijack Seth and Polly's car, ratcheting up the tension.  We're never quite sure how trigger-happy Dennis is or how crazy Lacey will get in need of her fix.

The quartet runs over an oddly infected raccoon, which blows a tire. Seth pricks his finger on a strange splinter while changing it out and Lacey goes nuts when the dead raccoon she confuses with her long lost cat begins to move. The car repaired, they tear off, only to have the vehicle overheat. Polly stops at the nearest gas station, which just happens to contain an infected gas station attendant. We now have our isolated location.

All that's missing is our monster, a plant-thing that co-opts its host's body.  The monster has a very specific biology that's integral to the plot; it's up to the survivors to figure out how the creature works.  Which is why, when you're being attacked by a plant monster, it's good to have a botanist on your side.

Splinter never moves beyond the gas station and doesn't need to.  The characters make dumb decisions, but they do so for good reasons - the convict and his junkie girlfriend are unstable enough to begin with. There are plenty of other parallels to Evil dead, which similarly confined the action to a handful of characters in an isolated location with killer plants (among other horrors), but that's a good thing.

There are some weeds in the plot. It takes awhile before the action really gets started as Splinter struggles mightily to convince us that Polly and Seth are a real couple. Wigham mumbles all of his lines, making some of his delivery impossible to understand.  And the ending, while satisfying, is a bit off in its timing.

Still, Splinter shouldn't be missed by monster horror aficionados. It has all the ingredients of a great horror film - and a great salad.",1247011200,2,2864,4.802443991853361
3652004,4,B001J4E19C,"I happened to hear about this movie through word of mouth. As a horror movie buff I try to keep up with everything new and worthwhile. Because I hadn't heard of this film before, I reluctantly rented it thinking it would be a real stinkeroo. I was pleasantly surprised. It was good, very good for a small budget horror flick. It was original, suspenseful, and harrowing, but, released in 2008, why had I never heard of this film before?

I did a little investigating and discovered this film won 6 awards at the SCREAMFEST HORROR FILM FESTIVAL, and was nominated for BEST HORROR FILM at the 35th annual SATURN AWARDS. So, why hadn't I heard of this film before?

I did a little more investigating. Whats most scary about this movie is that according to BOX OFFICE MOGO, SPLINTER's widest theatrical release was 4 theaters domestically. 4 THEATERS. F O U R, with virtually no advertising. Clearly SLINTER's distributors (MAGNOLIA PICTURES and MAGNET RELEASING)blew it.

Writer/Director Toby Wilkins has created a great original horror film on the order of QUARANTINE, THE DESCENT, or THE RUINS. Unfortunately this taut independent horror film only earned about $124,191 worldwide, probably because NOBODY KNEW ABOUT IT. WTF?

To give you an idea of how bad this film got screwed, THE UNBORN, another horror movie released this year(though not as good as SPLINTER), was released into 2,359 theaters domestically and earned about 75 million worldwide. I say again; Clearly SLINTER's distributors (MAGNOLIA PICTURES and MAGNET RELEASING)blew it.

This is a great object lesson for all you fledgling filmmakers out there; always secure disribution, and make sure the distributor will advertise and give your film a fair release, AND GET IT IN WRITING.",1247011200,9,1746,5.069686411149826
3652005,4,B001J4E19C,"Carpenter's ""Thing"" will be remembered while watching this film; however, in some ways, it outdoes its predecessor.  First, it doesn't happen in the arctic cold; second, it gets down to a little more personal level; and third, the ""bad guy"" nearly steals the show.

I am not one to give away much more plot than the trailers and I certainly am not going to give away a more than good ending (though, it is, perhaps, apparent a minute or two before then).  Suffice it to say that 4 people in an abandoned gas station really get to get personal with the ""beast"".

I had very little idea of what the movie was about.  I read just enough to tell I might like it enough to buy it on Amazon.  For Heaven's sake don't pay full price for it!  I am going to keep my copy, but I didn't buy it at the store.  Amazon had a good price and I always take advantage of it.  Or, you can rent it like ""normal"" folks...

I had thoughts of ""Feast"" (part one as part 2 sucked), so, if you liked that one, this one will warm your heart as well.  I put it above ""Feast"" purely because there was some science and rational thinking involved in ""Splinter"".  People used their heads and when going against something really bad, that's always preferable to just running away screaming into the night, falling down, and getting eaten.

The ""beast"" was done well the FX company should be proud.  The acting was actually quite good, though I had not seen any of the people in other films that I could recall (though they must be a little famous as their names appear in the Amazon tags).  I won't put it up against my favs, but, for 2 hours or less of decent, nervous fright, it held up pretty well. It gets a solid 4 from me.  Of course, that and a dollar gets you a hamburger!",1246579200,2,1747,4.248484848484848
3652006,4,B001J4E19C,"The concept of the unknown against a small group of folks isolated in a small area had been numerous times, most notably in films like ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Alien"" and ""The Thing"". ""The Mist"" followed this same formula although with a much larger group of folks. It is a very basic and simple concept that relies more in execution--this premise will provide the feeling of claustrophobia, terror and helplessness. However, this concept if done incorrectly and poorly will end up in a laughable disastrous film, a film that wouldn't have anything to offer in horror save for its predictable elements. Director Toby Wilkins' horror film, ""SPLINTER"" is one such film that follows the same formulas and is set up as a horror film with hardly any originality in regards to premise.

What made ""Splinter"" succeed when most other horror films couldn't? Well, the film has great production designs, the film does offer some surprises and I have to say the film is nicely made. It does have some valid scares, and well, the creature designs are just interesting--they also look very nasty and frightening. It may provide solid entertainment for the horror fan.

Seth and Polly (Paulo Costanzo and Jill Wagner respectively) is a couple who decides to have a nice time camping in the great outdoors. Seth isn't too keen about sleeping in the woods and when their tent won't cooperate, he convinces Polly to stay in a motel in town. Along the way they are carjacked by another couple (Shea Whigham and Rachel Kerbs) thinking they had to stop to help another motorist. Lacey is the junkie girlfriend of an ex-con named Dennis and they are on the run, so they decide to take Seth and Polly hostage. Things take a turn for the worse when they run over a creature in the road, and it turns out this creature is infected by parasitic splinters. When their car overheats, the four take refuge in a gas station, with its attendant also killed/infected by the same parasite. Lacey becomes the nasty monster's victim, as the parasite re-animates her dead corpse. The three are stuck inside the gas station, and to make matters worse, Dennis may have been infected by a splinter...

As I've mentioned, the film follows a very basic premise and the set up is just so full of clich. However, as soon director Toby Wilkins sets everything up rather quickly, the film does go into overdrive. It is highly entertaining and paced very well, the screenplay is kept in a manner that it generates a good deal of tension once the plot gets going. The film's ""Splinter creature"" is actually the film's main draw. The script does slowly flesh out its characteristics throughout its proceedings. Its weaknesses, its strengths and as to what it wants. The splinter parasite feeds on living cells, it takes what it needs and re-animates the dead organic remains after; making its new victim its new host. It also joins together the organic remains from its different victims that makes the creature looking very bloody, distorted and ugly--with movements that are definitely alien-like.

""Splinter"" has a great deal of blood, gore and violence. While the creature itself remains out of camera view most of the time, the film does also succeed in the generating a very tense atmosphere. But when the creature is in camera view, watch out. The viewer is privy to our monster's attempts to penetrate the glass enclosure, its entrails hanging out, heads are sticking to the side, disemboweled body parts are animated--plus a severed hand gets to torture our trio. The film is pretty high on the gross-out meter, while maintaining a convincingly scary feel. The film has little if no use of CGI effects, utilizing old-school prosthetics, make up and a lot of red ink to create our monster and gore effects.

While the screenplay by Ian Shorr and Kai Barry may not be perfect; admittedly, the film does have its share of holes and plot missteps, some parts required a large suspension of disbelief; the film does have some rather sympathetic characters going for it. True, they started off pretty clichd, but as the film's script goes on, the characters do have some depth. Polly and Seth is a very odd couple; a hot girl with a geeky guy; Polly proving herself more capable than Seth most of the time. Dennis is your stereotypical bad guy, but his character does offer some surprises and proves to be the convict with courage and compassion. The characters are also decently acted by its cast and they manage to achieve some growth and multi-dimensions throughout the film.

""Splinter"" is a solid horror film that relies on its credible tension and splatter blood effects to keep things rolling. The film is also helped along with its cast, the trio of Wagner, Costanzo and Whigham do establish needed chemistry in a film like this. It takes its limited concept, maximizing the film's location to its optimum effect. The direction and the camerawork is quite good, as it gives the film a rather stylish and organic feel, as opposed to the inert aesthetic in other horror films. The editing is also worth mentioning, since the film is superbly edited. ""Splinter"" may not attain horror `classic' status, but may indeed gain a cult following. The film is intense, scary enough to keep horror fans entertained and I think it would be safe to say that it rightfully won best picture in the 6th Screamfest awards.

3652008,4,B001J4E19C,"The sounds of bones snapping at awkward angles, dead bodies shuffling along the ground, arms being cut off, and screams of terror and delight welcome you to this film. Despite a low budget, Splinter offers up everything that horror aficionados look for. Strong tension, a creepy plot, and plenty of gore!

This is a great new take on a 'zombie' like film. But don't take the zombie idea too far, what we have here are bodies that are essentially reanimated by some sort of symbiotic biological mystery. And, convenient for us film watchers, it has an insatiable taste for blood. What could be better?

Wilkins has done a wonderful job with this film. It is short yet action packed, offers plenty of scares, and it does not rely on an abundance of special effects. This allows the film to excel in what it does best, scare you and make your skin crawl. The acting is above average, with Shea Whigham excelling in his role. The idea and story is fresh and interesting as well. The film work is well done, but it is a bit shaky. This is an intentional effect obviously, and it was not an issue that I even noticed when watching the film. If anything it adds to the effects and also allowed them to pull of some effects without the creatures looking cheesy or fake. It is not a hand-held camera and nothing like Blair Witch or Cloverfield. A film camera that moves with the action is perhaps the best way I can explain it. You can see examples on IMDB or YouTube trailers.

All in all, a well done film. I hope to see some more fun works from Wilkins.",1244505600,2,1547,4.421052631578948

It isn't a big budget movie but they did a lot within their means and they bring us a pretty good horror movie.

3652011,4,B001J4E19C,"Despite the appearance of its low budget start, Splinter recovers dramatically in the first few minutes of viewing. The actors are quite memorable -  and in fact most of us have seen them. It took me a couple of minutes to remember where I saw Paulo Costanzo for the first time. It was on the show 'Joey' opposite Matt Leblanc. As for Jill Wagner - she used to appear regularly on all the main channels (NBC, CBS, ABC) with the message 'You Gotta Put Mercury On Your List,' (lately appearing more regularly on Stargate Atlantis).

But it's their corky chemistry that captures the viewer's attention as they desperately try to portray a couple in love on a camping trip. And once their combined attempts at building a tent fail, they are off to an adventure of their own that delivered an exciting and memorable experience.

The couple find themselves in difficult situation when they pull over for a stranded hitchhiker and in turn inherit another troubling couple, this one on their escape to Mexico. As with hitchhiking thriller movies, the good Samaritans often end up paying the bill. Within minutes of the new passengers catching a ride, Jill and Paulo are split apart by an angry gangster with a gun and a drug addict with very unstable attitude.

To make the short ride even shorter, an incident on their road trip lands them at the closest gas station where rather than getting help, the characters are fighting for their survival under the attack of a particularly nasty looking `mold' thingy with spikes.

The movie could have ended there and most of us would have been happy, however the writer and director had a few more surprises up their sleeves. The survival of the passengers turns a lot more difficult as new rules to the mold's property are applied. It can spread exceptionally fast throughout a person's body only by pinching the skin.

While the thingy hunts the remaining survivors locked inside the gas station, the viewers are drawn into elaborate contraptions the actors make in order to gain their freedom. Of course, the gruesome images of the unlucky victims serve as a reminder that the movie was made to scare rather than trigger chuckles. This makes for an engaging and almost participatory viewing that keeps viewers attention alert.

The end is not disappointing as it leaves one to expect more (if the tab from this release can cover the expenses of a sequel).

Some times I have to approach all of the pros and cons about horror to make sure I do not return a few days later and think it wasn't quite as good or bad as my first reaction. I am so glad I did think about it, because now I feel more strongly that this film is great rather than just good. Splinter is a independent horror directed by Toby Wilkins. With a limited budget this is really well done. With such a great cast of actors you would think it was a huge budget. Even though none of these actors are known for anything else they did wonderful here. We usually do not get the satisfaction of watching great acting in low budget cinema. But then again it happens in high budget movies more often than not as well. This film brought a new idea to already old ones and far surpasses most of our expectations. Though not being scary it does have a lot of tension throughout the entire film. One particular scene that I won't spoil for anyone had me a bit surprised at how good it was. Gross and realistic I guess are two words that first pop into my head. While some might find the concept of this far from reality. Anyone who has watched a lot of horror knows that some of the best are the ones that our minds can't quite comprehend.

 A couple celebrating their anniversary decide to camp out in the wilderness. Being unable to set up their tent and being unfamiliar with the great outdoors they come to the conclusion that they should stay in a hotel instead. While driving the two stumble upon a woman on the side of the road. Pulling over they argue on whether to pick her up. Right away a man taps on the glass with a gun and forces the couple to drive them to their destination of choice. Hitting some thing in the road it pops the tire and puts a hole in the radiator. Realizing after fixing the tire that the car is over heating . They are forced to stop at a local gas station. The couple soon finds out that being hostages is the least of their problems.

 I highly recommend Splinter to all horror fans. Expect low budget at its finest. I'm sure not every one will enjoy this quite as much as I did. But for the most part it will fulfill your desires.",1243814400,2,2318,4.167410714285714

""Splinter"" might not win any awards but it's definitely worth a look by any serious fan of fantasy/horror--or just any movie-goer who wants something original and scary.

3652016,4,B001J4E19C,"Splinter (Toby Wilkins, 2008)

I've been holding off on reviewing this one, because I always feel oddly guilty giving a good review to anything that smells of Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie, but last week, At the Movies' Ben Mankiewicz had Splinter as his DVD Pick of the Week. I'm not alone! The funny thing is, for me it was doubly a surprise; thanks to the guys who import the descriptions at my cable company, who seem to have all been weathermen in their former careers, I thought this was the 2006 Edward James Olmos thriller (which I'm really excited for, and yet still haven't seen) when I set it to record. So when I started watching and found this, I was pretty disappointed. It had to go a lot farther than most bad horror movies to win my respect. It did so, and then went a couple of steps farther.

Seth (Paulo Costanzo from TV's Joey) and Polly (Blade: The Series' Jill Wagner) are urban types. Polly has convinced Seth to head out to the country and do a little camping for their anniversary. Until, that is, there's a tent malfunction. On their way back to the city, they meet up with hitchhikers Lacey (Rachel Kerbs in her first credited role) and her boyfriend Dennis (Shea Whigham from Wristcutters: A Love Story and Lords of Dogtown). The four of them stop at a convenience store that, they soon find out, has been attacked by...something. We're not sure what.

One of the best things about this movie is one of my favorite things about many horror movies that are on my short shelf of immortal flicks--we never find out what the particular beastie is that's threatening them. The unknown factor makes this movie so much scarier than it would have otherwise been, and so few screenwriters and directors understand that. Wilkins (who got tabbed for the upcoming The Grudge 3, and at this point I'm enough in love with his work to think he may actually make it worth watching) and screenwriters Kai Barry (his first screenwriting credit!) and Ian Shorr (Destination: Truth) get it right the first time 'round, which I find really impressive. As well, there's a lot of big-screen-level acting from a lot of small-screen actors. Whigham, especially, just blew me away here. Part of that is script; the characters here are much, much more complex than you expect from the usual monster movie (the thing I kept comparing this to was Carpenter's The Fog, and I have to say, the characters are better-defined in Splinter than they were in Carpenter's classic), but Whigham really brings that complexity to life more than the other actors do with their characters. Not to say that the others don't work here; Costanzo has the perfectmix of geekiness and bravado that you'd expect form the kind of Walter Mitty-type we expect from him, while Wagner, despite having a pretty stock ""oh-check-it-out-strong-chick!"" role, gets as deep into it as she can. Kerbs' role is too small to really say much about; she, of all the leads, is the most one-dimensional (though the why of that becomes kind of obvious once we've seen enough of her to get where she's at in her life). In other words, you've got a taut script, real characters you might expect to bump into on the street, a rising star in the director's chair, and a really, really awesome monster. How can you possibly go wrong? ****",1242950400,,3292,4.682210708117444
3652017,3,B001J4E19C,"I have to say I was surprised at how entertained I was by ""Splinter"". I was expecting a goofy CGI creature fest, but actually found ""Splinter"" to be a cut above the usual B-Movie found in the Blockbuster bargain bin.

The basic storyline is that a vacationing couple is taken hostage by a man and woman on the run. Unfortunately, they decide to stop off and get gas where a murderous ""thing"" has taken up residence.

What really drives ""Splinter"" are the characters, particularly Jill Wagner's performance as the female hostage Polly. Her character is strong and likable in a way not usually found in this type of film. Instead of over-the-top, she has a realistic toughness that you can't help but cheer for. Shea Whigham's con-on-the-run Dennis Farell is another great character. As the story plays out, you actually see both characters evolve and grow without being forced or played out in a cartoonish manner.

""Splinter"" also features some great special effects. The CGI is present, but it's not overwhelming, and the basic effects are still old school latex and red goop, which is a nice change of pace in this day and age.

If you are looking for something a little different, but still want the chills and thrills associated with a good B-Movie creature feature, then give ""Splinter"" a shot.",1242604800,16,1299,4.811659192825112
3652018,2,B001J4E19C,"Here's the concept in 25 words or less: three people locked inside a gas station. Outside, there's this biological thing that turns people into blood-feeding zombie-with-spikes creatures trying to get in (but they don't since they stay on the ground contorting most the time).

PROS
Good camera work.
Good cinematography.
Nice effects.
Good music.

CONS
The screenplay is underdeveloped... and that's where the BIG problem is. The creature (although dangerous) ends up being pretty harmless because it is locked outside all the time and the threat situations are much more a matter of cinematic enhancement (with the camera shaking and the music playing  la Bernard Herrmann) than a matter of narrative ingenuity.

The films builds some moments of suspense, but if you really look at them... come on... it's two people scared of a severed hand!!! It's just too silly! If I were in their place, I would have just ran to the car (which would only take two seconds - and the creature is pretty slow most of the time), lock the doors and drive away.

And the film would end after 40 minutes.

There is no real horror here except for two or three moments... and the scene where the couple fights the hand is laughable. It reminded me of Thing from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Addams-Family/dp/6305744793/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Addams Family</a>.

A rabid porcupine seems to be replicating itself through any living thing it wants to infect, and animating whatever tissue it can find. This means lots of hands and arms chasing around hapless victims, and sometimes those appendages are still attached to the victims' body. Once the splinters have a hold of someone, and this is the neato innovation of the movie in terms of creature, the virus will literally break its host apart in order to get at what it needs, so basically it moves by snapping the bones of the poor buggers who fall prey. Fast camera work and the use of a gymnast to move the monster is very impressive, as I said- it's always good to watch actual horrorcraft instead of computer gimmicks.

Perhaps because of this and the poor acting and set design at the beginning (horrible scene with a couple going camping and deciding that camping is not for them, what? Why??) and that they are driving a car with ridiculous painted on `dirt' meant that it took about 15-20 minutes to settle in and enjoy it for what it is - a good strong indie horror. Beyond those opening minutes, the movie is great, a scary believable creature, nice snappy pace and some genuinely terrifying effects. It was obviously made on a budget and the director does a great job with what he's got. If it weren't for the poor plotting at the beginning that I already mentioned, I'd have given it five stars.

3652026,4,B001J4E19C,"This movie is actually an above average B creature horror flick. The beginning scene had me worried as it seemed really cheesy but once the main characters are introduced and make it the gas station [the main setting] , this movie really takes off. There are two couples in this movie - Paulo Costanzo and Jill Wagner who are celebrating their anniversary with a camping trip but who then meet another couple, Shea Whigham and Rachel Kerbs who are on the run. The nice couple get carjacked and eventually all four make it to a remote gas station where the mayhem begins. A parasitic life-form is on the loose and apparently preys on other living creatures, feeding from the inside and sprouting 'splinters' or sharp spikes which can in turn infect others.

I thought the acting was rather well-done given this is a low-budget indie horror flick. The stand out performance was Shea Wigham as the con on the run who is not a mere cardboard cut-out but a complex character. As the plot unfolds, the three main characters reveal themselves. Initially I was rather annoyed by the geek character in the movie, but he too redeems himself midway through.

The effects were nothing to rave about, but what I really liked in this movie was the way the suspense is kept going, resulting in a truly creepy horror movie that had me jumping out of my seat a couple of times. Sadly, it was rather short, only about 1 hr 15 mins running time, which didn't leave much time for exploring the origins of the parasite etc.

The DVD itself has some extras such as a director's commentary, the making of the creature feature etc. Though it isn't highly original [reminded me of aspects of Evil Dead, Reanimator, The Thing etc], it is actually quite entertaining and kept my interest for the most part.",1240099200,,1779,4.641269841269842
3652027,5,B001J4E19C,"It's so amazing as a fan of horror films to find this avalanche of new films coming out that offer something different and new. Between this film and LET THE RIGHT ONE IN we are being offered new takes on old themes as well as new creations to fear. Having had to live through countless remakes and sequels, it's nice for a change. And SPLINTER may be one of the best to come along.

The story begins with a couple, Seth and Polly (Paulo Costanzo and Jill Wagner) on vacation celebrating their anniversary. When plans to camp are demolished (along with their tent) they hit the road in an attempt to find a motel for the night. As they drive down the road they see a young girl hitching a ride. As they stop to pick her up, her boyfriend steps beside the car, armed with a pistil and takes control.

The girl's name is Lacey (Rachel Kerbs) and her boyfriend is Dennis (Shea Willingham) and they're on the run. For what reason we don't know, just that they're heading to the border of Mexico. Lacey seems to be ill and her judgment is seen to definitely be impaired when the car runs over a small animal in the road and she thinks it's her lost pet.

Whatever the animal was, it flattens a tie which Polly and Dennis change while Lacey and Seth investigate what the critter was. While in the process of changing the tire, Dennis gets his hand pricked by what appears to be splinters sticking out of the tire but thinks nothing of it.

As Seth and Lacey look at the dead animal, it's impossible to tell for sure what it is, not just because it was hit but because it seems malformed. As they get closer, it begins to move and a screaming Lacey runs back to the car yelling for them to get out of the area.

They head down the road, never realizing that this same animal punctured the radiator hose as well. With a steaming car they pull into a gas station seen at the beginning of the film prior to credits where the attendant was attacked. When Lacey goes to use the bathroom, she discovers his body, malformed and covered in the splinters as well, twisting and turning as it comes after her.

Screaming again, she tells them all to get in the car but not before the creature attacks her and knocks her to the curb near the pumps, killing her. Dennis shoots the strange looking attendant but sees him moving which prompts the three to run into the building, locking the door behind them.

Able to watch the cameras on the pump, they witness Lacey come back to life, her body manipulating into insane positions as the sharp prongs begin to emit from her body. Dennis yanks the phone from the wall to stop Polly from calling the police since he's on the run. Never a smart move in a horror film.

As the three find themselves trapped inside the station with a newly formed creature outside waiting for the opportunity to attack, they think all might be well when a police woman shows at the door. Intent on capturing Dennis, she ignores their warnings of the creature on the roof and soon becomes the next victim, pulled in half.

Polly and Seth begin to formulate a plan to reach out and get the walkie talkie attached to the belt of the police woman. A combination of wire hangers and duct tape gets them results but not before the splinter creature attacks and tries to get in via the change box they were using to reach out. They get the gate closed but not before it cuts off the hand of the creature.

Worst nightmares are realized as the hand begins to stand and walk on its own in search of the victims in the building. Humorous and yet creepy as it walks around, they escape it and narrowly reach safety in the freezers. But it also provides them with a clue as the cold affects the hand.

With their chances of survival decreasing by the minute, the heroes must search for any possible chance they can to either escape or get help. The police woman's car offers that opportunity but getting to it is another matter altogether. And it will take courage in Seth, who up until now has appeared rather lame, to get help.

As all of this goes down, Dennis is slowly changing. He's kept it from the pair as the story moved along, but the discoloration in his arm and its seemingly attempt to move on its own shows that the creature is entering him from the earlier spiked tire. The only solution? Cut off his arm.

So there you have it. A new creature we've never seen before, a trapped trio trying to survive and get help and a scary story that this time around does involve gory effects but ones that seem to go along with the story rather than be set pieces to demonstrate what an effects team can do. Can this trio survive the night? Will they kill the creature? Will they escape to warn the world? The only way to find out is to watch and see.

The cast does an excellent job here and I actually found myself wanting to see them all in more films. Willingham does a tremendous job coming off as threatening and then revealing more to the character than one would expect as they story moves forward.

And this new creature, the splinter monster, offers a terrifying vision as it contorts bodies and slowly emits spikes from their bodies. Reminiscent of the original blob in that it comes from nowhere and just absorbs everything living in its path, it is a terrifying monster that won't soon be forgotten.

If you like original horror films that offer as many scares as they do gore effects, then you won't want to miss this movie. It offers both in droves. And the next time you're driving down and old highway and see that small roadside gas station? Unless you're near empty my guess is you'll keep driving by.",1240099200,,5618,4.3875
3652028,4,B001J4E19C,"This movie deserves the praise it's getting from critics and audiences.
It's a well done low budget movie with excellent acting. In fact it has a solid storyline that is well thought out and logical.  It doesn't go for cheap thrills and plays out as if these were real people and not stereotypes.  As a fan of b movies , I usually give them their own b movie scale usually that isn't comparable to stars for a first run or A movie.  But this is good on the regular scale of movie making too.  The blu ray looks excellent as you'd expect and the violence is not overblown. The creature is something one could imagine existing although we don't ever get to see where it came from. But then the people that are trying to survive the attack would have no idea of what or where this situation started from either.  So ""Splinter"" is a solid well thought out horror movie that can be a great watch for even non b movie fans.  It's just excellent and the director could easily switch genres into any kind of movie for his next effort.  He understands what a straight story means alot better than many others within the b movie genre.  So this one put a fun splinter under my skin and it's well worth owning.",1239926400,,1199,4.321428571428571
3652029,4,B001J4E19C,"I heard about this film through Fangoria magazine.  They raved about this film for at least two months previous to its dvd release.  Fangoria rarely steers me wrong(with the exception of Route 66, will never understand what greatness Dr. Cyclops saw in that crap-fest)

I just watched it and it is truly a great monster movie.  It's got the usual monster film tropes of two innocents trapped in a deserted location accompanied by two undesriables holding them hostage.  Of course the abandoned location, a gas station in this film, isn't as abandoned as they thought.  A new movie monster hangs there and brings them nothing but trouble.

The creature has been compared to the alien in Carpenter version of The Thing, but it's really more akin to the alien Vincent D'nofrio played in Men In Black.  It's a creature that uses a 'splinter' to take over beings and keeps their physical imprints as it goes along.  This leads to a creature that, in design, is truly original and wonderfully creepy.  It holds some more surprises for the horror fans but I'll lead them for you to discover.  The effects on the creature, practical and prosthetic, are awesome, but the true credit must also go the way of a fit gymnist doing the movements.  No CIG here folks!  All real people doing depth-defying acts to bring you something new.  It's great stuff.  A behind the scenes featurette included on the disc will give more insight into how the creature was achieved.

The acting is all on the money.  Sure, there's not a tone of depth or character study moments, but the performers all bring gravity and realism to their parts.  You believe in what they do or decide and you believe their fear, you may share it.  The cinematography is gorgeous and drenched in blackness.  This is a classic creature feature, one where the goods aren't all give up within the first thirty minutes.  You get your glimpses and then the finale gives you the full visage in all its grotesque glory.

This is no Alien, but it's close, and it's definately better then The Relic, which was also a good creature feature, but on a shallower level.",1239926400,2,2108,4.686648501362398

I thought that was weird since it's not a made for Sci-Fi channel cheese fest, so I waited for the full version to come out on DVD. This is one inventive horror flick with a great creature and a pretty good cast. I was really impressed by Shea Whigham as the killer, but even more so with Jill Wagner. She is not your typical horror female who always says and does all the wrong things. With her good looks and better than expected acting, she should have a promising career. Sure the movie borrows a lot from John Carpenter's The Thing, but that is one of my favorite movies of all time, so in this case, it's a good thing. The shaky camera does get a little old, but it's used to cover up a good look at the creature (the less you see the scarier it is) due to the low budget. I really love the how and the why of this creature. It is a great movie monster that is truly terrifying. Splinter is worth the time of any horror fan.",1239753600,3,1031,4.0588235294117645
3652031,4,B001J4E19C,"Every so often, a horror movie comes around that manages to defy many of the conventions that plague the genre, and ends up being something special.  Splinter is one such horror flick, in which a couple (Paulo Costanzo and Jill Wagner) are carjacked by an escaped convict (Shea Whigham) and his junkie girlfriend (Rachel Kerbs).  After breaking down in front of a gas station, they all soon come to learn that there's a blood-thirsty, splinter-esque parasite on the loose that can take its victims over as hosts, and soon enough they're barricaded inside trying to hold it off.  Featuring a surprisingly good cast that performs quite well, Splinter delivers the goods that horror fans look for in terms of suspense and gross-out effects.  While there are moments where the film's small budget becomes apparent, Splinter excells on nearly every level.  It's taut, briskly-paced, scary, and well-acted, and in the end, Splinter is something that horror fans should by all means give a well-deserved look at the very least.",1239667200,4,1020,5.0476190476190474
3652032,5,B001J4E19C,"Usually do not get to horror that often, but this title was given such a miserable release slate, no one got to see it around here. But Magnet titles are almost a must see for customers now (Let the Right One In and Timecrimes especially) and once again they provided a nice little (and overlooked) independent.

A simple enough story of good and bad souls unwittingly brought together in a remote region, then subjected to some nasty creatures while taking refuge in a gas station. There are the flurry of moments where the characters drivel on and plan dumb things, but Shea Wigham (from all the way back in Tigerland) has a great screen presence and really holds this together. A few guys asking about this new hot gal (most recognized from the Blade series) in Jill Wagner, who manages not to be the irritating-useless-screaming victim. Jittery cameras, fun looking critters/zombies (very reminiscent of the Thing creatures) , and plenty of blood to go around make this a fun title.

The picture and sound were great. The 5.1 DTS gets used mostly when the critters do their little cricket sounds. The picture clarity was outstanding for an independent film and came across superbly for Blu. There were lots of chances for this to go bad with all of the moving spikes/spines and night footage, but they did well. There were plenty of prop flubs and unanswered questions but once you watch the plethora of short supplements, one realizes what a challenge it can be to make a film like this. The featurettes include material on the special effects, creatures, weather, props, and even a how to on making a Splinter pumpkin (courtesy of the extrovert Ms. Wagner).

A worthwhile purchase for the creature fans out there, and the lower list price doesn't hurt either.",1239321600,7,1765,4.7993421052631575

Splinter tells the story of a young couple on holiday gets car-jacked by an escaped convict but while driving they suffer a flat tire near a gas station but soon that will be the least of their worries.

Splinter is a low budget independent horror flick from first-time film maker Toby Wilkins. Who has created a terrifying horror which will scare you s**tless!

Shea Wigham is the real standout, as the escaped con with some real humanity and courage.

3652037,4,B001J4E19C,"Splinter Movie Review
Grade: B+
 Let me start out by saying one thing: Splinter is a horror indie that does work for the best. Yes, people are complaining that the shaky camera work and editing make the movie hard to bear, but it works, it really does. The way the camera lingers just for a second on the creature makes it all the scarier. The film is short, only 82 minutes, and the shaky camerawork makes that time go by even faster, making this chiller all the better.
 The basis for Splinter is that a parasite-thing (they don't really explain why it's there, it's just there, which is the only reason why I give it 4 stars, not 5, the movie raises a lot of questions but only answers a few of them) is on the loose in the backwoods of some campground forest. The first scene of the movie is it, in the form of a wolf (It shoots the ""Splinters"" at any living thing, causing them to become ""infected"" and then the Splinters basically take control of the host, making them kill and have a taste for flesh) attacking a gas station attendant, infecting him with a good amount of Splinters.
 The movie then cuts to two campers, one happy, (Polly Watt, played by Jill Wagner) one unhappy, (Seth Belzer, played by Paulo Costanzo) who are camping for their anniversary, much to Seth's dislike. But after a ripped tent they are forced to head back. But along the way they are car-jacked by an escaped convict and his drug-addicted girlfriend, (Dennis Farell and Lacey Belisle, played by Shea Whigham and Rachel Kerbs) who take the lead and order Polly to drive. But soon they hit something...unnatural. With Splinters sticking out of its dead body. Big trouble for our foursome.
 While changing the tire (which went flat after hitting the animal) Dennis gets a Splinter stuck in his finger, but doesn't yet know the extent of the damage. Lacey, on the other hand, see's the ""dead"" creature moving, apparently still alive, and starts to freak out. But with all the drugs in her system, Dennis thinks she's just hallucinating...
 The car is forced to stop at a lonesome gas station after the radiator overheats (hitting the creature did more damage to the car then they thought) and Lacey goes to the bathroom, to do more drugs. When it doesn't open, she kicks it open in a drug-induced rage. And screams at the gory sight. The attendant who was attacked in the beginning of the movie is still alive, and manages to say, ""Kill me"" before he becomes completely ""infected"" and attacks Lacey. The terror begins...
 And the parts I've just described are just the first twenty minutes of the movie, which is a pretty much non-stop thrill ride and manages to put in scares and plenty of gore. For a low-budget movie, the special effects are good, the editing good, and most importantly, the actors are good. They're great actually, which is a really rare thing in a horror movie. They establish their characters in the first part of the movie, and then throw them into their situation with great effort. From the druggie to the unhappy camper, they're all great actors. Even the cop that gets ripped in half. (""Ma'am, go back to your car! You're not safe here! ""I'll stay right here!"")
 In the end, Splinter is a great horror film; even if does seem to draw ideas from other horror movies. (e. g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ruins/dp/B0013FZUQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ruins</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002CHK1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;, and the shaky camera effects of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>.

They are both awesome.  I'm not sure that calling this a monster movie is totally accurate.  If you thought ""The Ruins"" was a monster movie, than you will think this is too.
