8694083,5,B00008AORK,"A TV special that makes fun of TV--wise, witty and humane Cheever conquers the airwaves as he did the printed page.  I admit this little gem might be over the heads of those who make a habit of television.  You know, you can find a lot of cartoons on YouTube...  Most of the characters of Shady Hill are of one variety of silly person or another, but the author allows them some dignity as human beings as well. He even makes a moral of the futility of alcohol in this seemingly serene bit of Westchester County. This work (with closing narration by John Cheever himself) should have been first in a series of Cheever works for television, but alas the author died not long after the teleplay was broadcast.",1532995200,,707,4.465116279069767
8694084,1,B00008AORK,Just put the DVD in the machine last week after purchasing in May. The DVD does not work.  Really wanted to see this movie because I had a bit part in it.  Lousy return policy (30 days is baloney).  Stay away.,1468108800,,209,4.048780487804878
8694085,2,B00008AORK,"The 1982 production of John Cheever's The Shady Hill Kidnapping is NOT  what I prefer to see of a theatre stage performance.  I want to view and experience the exact theatre performance with a few different stage scenes.  It needs to look like a copy of theatre performance, not turning into some pathetic movie get-up.

One of the most recognized faces in Shady Hill Kidnapping is Polly Holliday, (the Kiss-My-Grits Lady).  Celeste Holm stars in ..... ok, this is really bizarre for a theatre performance, commercial for ""Elixircol"" a mocking of a drug that may save the lonely, dejected, depressed, older, nameless, and unnoticed people.  The bottle comes in regular and supersize.  These ""commercials"" are interspersed within the theatre/movie production.  Highly unusual.

So, the story is an elderly couple have their two adult children at home, and one child who was mistakenly ""kidnapped"".  The child was actually with a neighbor lady.  But, the grown son goes to report the child, is ignored and decided to write his own ransom note to get attention for the lost kid.  The town then gets involved in raising money.

Maybe in John Cheever's day, this may have been humorous, but I got nothing out of it...nothing funny, nothing amusing, nothing interesting....rather boring, and with those ridiculous commercials.  This reminds me of another John Cheever  play that had that some homey-town feeling, and look to it, and was equally unamusing,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Cheever-s-The-Sorrows-of-Gin-Broadway-Theatre-Archive/dp/B0000714BH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Cheever's The Sorrows of Gin (Broadway Theatre Archive)</a>......Rizzo",1294444800,,1700,5.853658536585366
