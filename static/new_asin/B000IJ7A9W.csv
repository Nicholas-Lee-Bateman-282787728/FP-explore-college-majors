If you're somebody who's been brave enough to keep trying when it comes to viewing the low budget independent horror films put out by the likes of Brain Damage, Asylum, EiCinema, Troma, Full Moon, etc., and have found yourself screaming, ""Why?  Why!  WHY?!!!!  How hard can it be to come up with a FUN horror movie that lives up to its catchy title and cover art?""  Well, I have good news!  This one lives up to both!  While at first the cover art might make you think it's going to be about a seductive bride who uses sex to lure and then pick off her latest grooms, it is not.  But... it's the fact that this movie is not what you expect (that movie's already been made) is what makes it so refreshing and entertaining.  Now, this one features a very normal bride... at least normal in looks, lol.  She's very good looking but not in the modern day Jim Wynorski adult film star turned softcore B-Movie kind of way.  No, Renee Madison Cole is the kind of girl you'd see in a bar, coffee shop, or bookstore and feel comfortable and happy to talk to without feeling like a customer on sniffer's row at a strip club.  She's perfect for the role and her looks compliment her character's extra EXTRA sense of jealousy.  Speaking of strippers, Alexis Golightly (Demon Resurrection) is my pick for standout up and comer Scream Queen/B-Movie Babe to keep an eye out for.  You can't take your eyes off of her when on screen.  She too isn't your typical silicon enhanced starlet.  She's a true natural in both beauty and acting.  The men in the cast are all spot on perfect as well.  They act in a way that lets you know this movie is not to be taken seriously and neither are they as the next Laurence Olivier/John Gielgud.  Definitely more in line with the way the cast of Impractical Jokers act when playing characters during some of the bits that require ""acting"" on their show.  Miles away (thank God) from the modern day PG-13 cardboard ""comedy relief"" characters found in horror films, these guys are more like what you'd see if you and your buddies made a tongue in cheek horror movie at home.  So over the top that it works to a tee.  And speaking of tees... the kills in this movie are creative as all get up (death by dildo, hand over vomit mouth gagging, and a golf tee to the ear followed by FORE!).  Yeah, make no mistake this is a low budget shot on digital affair starring actors you won't find in blockbuster films by Spielberg.  But if you go into it expecting a schlocky horror parody done right, then this is one to definitely check out.  A great movie for Halloween season viewing.  Highly recommended for the low budget modern day B-Movie fan who's been disappointed in the past time after time.  Finally, we have a winner!",1506211200,,2755,4.42544731610338
8145833,1,B000IJ7A9W,"From the absolutely horrific acting, to the laughably trite script, everything about this pic is amateurish.  Not funny, not scary, not sexy, not interesting.  A sub-mental waste of time.",1214524800,,187,5.413793103448276
8145834,5,B000IJ7A9W,"This is the best low budget film of 2006 hands down. Way better than Open Water, which I actually enjoyed despite the fact that it's now become vogue to bash it (similar to Blair Witch). The movie was funny in the right places, frightening in others. A terrific little indie shot on digital. One of the best looking little digital films I've ever seen. These guys made huge strides since their first film, The Van, which was also quite enjoyable. I can't wait to see what these guys are gonna do next! The acting wasn't bad considering most of these actors were amateurs. The camera-work was nice. Lighting was nice. Dialogue sharp. This flick is a gem. Rent it when you can.

8145835,2,B000IJ7A9W,"Funny in a juvenile way.  So so gore. Basically a bride objects to her groom consummating their marriage on their wedding day so stabs him to death.  Then meets up with another fellow on the rebound and sets about emasculating him on the way to their wedding, ie no night out with the lads, no stag do etc.  However, his mates ignore her so she decides the knife is the best way to restore order.  Cheap budget, one topless stripper and frat style type humour.  Under no circumstances mistake it for the far superior Blood Splattered Bride!",1173830400,,540,4.525773195876289
