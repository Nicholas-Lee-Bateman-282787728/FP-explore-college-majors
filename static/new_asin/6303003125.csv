7834801,2,6303003125,"This thriller was made for Canadian TV and only redeemed from the B stockpile by the acting of Peter Outerbridge as a wanna be fashion photographer, and the appearance of Sally Kellerman as the agent for ""the beauty"" Jennifer Rubin. Rubin is perhaps the most lead-footed model I've ever seen, so it's not unexpected when everyone aroud her begins to be killed, though suicide isn't considered as a motive. While she is attractive, Rubin's acting is so flat and she is so physically stiff that you pray that she will be the next to get it. It's a little like the way Kathleen Turner thought so she was such hot stuff in Body Heat. Here Rubin turns heads in the street even before she starts modeling (in a convenient plot turn), in spiteof her dressing the way Outerbridge describes as if for  ""Siberian Vogue"". Outerbridge is a James Spada look-alike without having Spada's mannerist style and whilst his acting is technically superior to Kellerman's, she outclasses him in star power. Given the best nasty lines, she dresses in male drag to prove the claim that she ""swings both ways"". Director Paul Lynch's work is barely inspired. He slurps over the horror music and gives us close-ups of ringing telephones, though there is an unintentional laugh in the cat scare shot when it appears that the poor kitty has been thrown into frame to approximate it jumping. At least we are spared the cat from being a victim, or Kellerman's highrise balcony being used for someone to be pushed from. The low point is the music video that Rubin participates in, where she is so inept that even her walking requires a choreographer. It's indicative of Lynch's sensibility that when TV news features footage from the ""yet unreleased' clip, what we see is the replica of the take we saw being filmed, but magically edited from different shots. If this genius music video director can produce such material (we also know he's a genius because he's the kind who sits on a moving camera and speaks in a British accent) perhaps the Canadian TV producers should have hired him instead of Lynch to make their film. The revelation of the killer jumps over countless red herrings, and is preposterous, but ironically allows Rubin to finally come to life.",971308800,5,2231,4.764857881136951
