8763088,2,B01GK8Y83U,"This movie is definitely shit, but not really very violent. I really wanted to like this movie. The problem with this reboot of the Violent Shit series is that it isn't nearly violent enough and doesn't have enough Karl the Butcher in it. It tries to shoehorn Karl the Butcher into a giallo film. It fails as a giallo, and it fails as a gore film. What gore is in the movie is actually pretty good, there just isn't nearly enough of it. The score by Claudio Simonetti of Goblin is pretty good, but features recycled material from another movie. The actual presentation of this movie by Reel Gore Releasing is top notch, it's really great treatment for a not so great movie. I can't really recommend this to anyone other than fans of the original Violent Shit series, and I think even many of them will be disappointed. To everyone else, if you want to see real ""Violent Shit"", just pick up the Violent Shit collection from Synapse Films.",1518393600,,937,4.517647058823529

8763090,1,B01GK8Y83U,This film is complete garbage. There is no sign of a coherent plot. The majority of this film is just people talking. Any scenes that feature gore only last for about ten seconds and those scenes are few and far between. This was an attempt to capitalize on a name that hardcore horror fans would recognize. There is nothing redeemable about this film.,1483488000,6,352,4.603174603174603

8763092,3,B01GK8Y83U,"I have never seen the OG Violent S*** so I can't say that it has any special place in my heart. I am a fan of Italian horror and giallo movies, which is why I picked this up. I don't know anything about the German influences and have never really watched any of their gore movies. The concept and character of Karl the Butcher is pretty damn cool I have to admit. The girl with the haircut is pretty hot, the others are busted. Giovanni Lombardo Radice is old, pale, creepy and awesome. The cameos were cool, I especially enjoyed seeing Barbara Magnolfi. As any proper American would I watched the English dub which was laughable. The acting and dialog seemed extremely poor but it probably plays slightly better in its original language with subtitles. The soundtrack by Claudio Simonetti's Goblin was fantastic. The actual release by ReelGore is excellent, looks like they took a few notes from Grindhouse. I never found much of the Italian atmosphere in the movie I was hoping for, but it exists here and there. The finale was well done and entertaining in its gore and sleaze. The whole concept has potential, but overall the movie was dogs***. I would say your experience will directly be affected on how under the influence you are of drugs.",1472256000,12,1247,4.647058823529412
