8074288,3,B000A3XYJ6,"As the name implies, FINAL CONFLICT was meant to be both the semi-finals and finals of the Pride Heavyweight Grand Prix of 2004, which had already gone through its opening and quarterfinal rounds. At FINAL CONFLICT, the last four survivors of the original sixteen competitors assembled at the Saitama Super Arena to settle just who was the best heavyweight MMA fighter on the planet. The semis pitted Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira against Sergei Kharitonov and Fedor Emilianenko against Naoya Ogawa, with the winners were to face each other for the Grand Prix belt and the $250,000 prize. Unfortunately, things didn't go quite as the organization -- or the fighters -- planned, and this is why I gave the card a meager three stars instead of the four it probably deserved. I don't believe it is a spoiler but merely a heads-up to tell the perspective buyer that the finals ended in a no-contest due to an unintentional head-butt, and the actual resolution of the tournament had to wait until the SHOCKWAVE 2004 card. In other words, if you buy this DVD expecting to see the resolution of the GP, you will be gravely disappointed, and will have to buy SHOCKWAVE to get your satsifaction. Put another way, to watch the whole tourney to its conclusion, you have to have the following events:

TOTAL ELIMINATION 2004
CRITICAL COUNTDOWN 2004
FINAL ELIMINATION 2004
SHOCKWAVE 2004

Now to the card itself. There are seven fights in the lineup, three tourney fights and four otherweight matches. They are (spoiler free):

Kharitonov - Nog: an entertaining, all action heavyweight fight with a somewhat arguable decision. I think this possibly could have been a draw and I'd have liked to see a third round.

Fedor - Ogawa: I'd better refrain from comment, as there's no way to say anything about this at all without giving away the outcome.

Kazuhiro Nakamura vs. Murilo Bustamante: A technical fight between two grappling experts yields a mild surprise in the form of the winner.

Mirko Cro Cop vs. Aleksander Emilianenko: In a clash of heavyweight gunslingers, the vicious-kicking Cro Cop takes on Fedor's ""little"" (6'7"") brother, the reigning Sambo world champion and a skilled boxer himself. My favorite fight of the card.

Wanderlei Silva vs. Yuki Kondo: By this time Wand had annihilated the middleweight division and defeated all-comers, but Kondo was absolutely determined to dethrone him. A good action fight.

As you can see, this card has some worthwhile fights as well as the awe-inspiring production values that set Pride so far apart from the UFC, but the final being a no-contest was a bucket of cold water on what up to that point had been a brightly burning flame. And I feel as well that this DVD should have been sold as part of a multi-DVD set which included SHOCKWAVE 2004, so that the buyer could have gotten proper resolution. After all if the conflict ain't final, then the name is false advertising.",1384214400,,2912,4.880566801619433
8074289,5,B000A3XYJ6,I gave this 5 stars even though the main event is lackluster. the opening match in the hwgp kharitnov vs nogueria was an all out war and propz to the winner for advancing. another great match on this card is mirko cro cop at the time the best striker there was against aleksandre emilianenko the younger brother of the great Fedor. amazing finish to this. my personal favorite fight was wanderlei vs yuki kondo. im a huge wandy fan and a fan of the chute boxe. get this event along with round 2. you don't miss much because round one is kind of boring. round 2 has 2 of the best slams in pride ever,1225238400,,598,4.208695652173913
8074290,4,B000A3XYJ6,"Very good Pride DVD. Nice matchups with plenty of action. A couple of fights were human highlight reels. A great DVD for the true MMA fans who will miss Saitama Super Arena. Japanese fans were amazing. Disciplined, appreciative and respectful. US fans have a long way to go to match Japanese appreciation of MMA. With that said...very good DVD.",1186012800,,344,4.8474576271186445
8074291,5,B000A3XYJ6,"yes, the very last fight does end in disappointing fashion, but the entire card before that is filled with extremely exciting fights.  the Cro Cop/Aleks fight is one of the best ever, as is the Sergei/Nog and Kondo/Silva fights.  Watching Fedor take on Ogawa is also a pleasant treat.",1152489600,3,284,4.775510204081633
8074292,4,B000A3XYJ6,"The introduction of this event still blows my mind everytime I see it. The fights on this are pretty good... above average in terms of Pride events IMO. Really, the intro is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of this event. You really should buy this... it is an excellent event that you will enjoy seeing.",1150761600,2,322,4.295081967213115
8074293,3,B000A3XYJ6,"This is a pretty good fight video but it is disappointing.  You may as well know up front that the ""final conflict"" does not happen.  You don't get to see it.

The ""final conflict"" is the championship fight of the heavyweight tournament.  The final four square off on this video, and there are two winners who are supposed to fight for the championship.  However the fight does not happen.  Instead, one of the fighters, the better one as a matter of fact, gets a nasty head cut from an accidental head collision, and the fight is ruled a ""no contest"".

For the faint of heart (like me) be warned that you see some very graphic shots of fingers prying apart the skin on the man's forehead, showing a really bad and deep cut wide open to inspection.  The skin is separated a good bit.

There are some good fights on the card.  It is still worth watching, even though there is no conclusion.",1145059200,4,889,4.398773006134969
8074294,5,B000A3XYJ6,"Final Conflict 2004 was the finals of the PRIDE Heavyweight Grand Prix and was overall a tremendous event.

This event showcases the best fighters in the world.  Fedor Emelianenko, Antonio Nogueira, Yuki Kondo, Mirko Cro Cop, and Wanderlei Silva are among the mega-stars you will see on this event.

Despite the controversial ending the main event, this event is packed with great fights.  And of course, the MMA legend himself, Kazushi Sakuraba is on the card and puts on a great performance.",1131580800,2,493,4.975609756097561
