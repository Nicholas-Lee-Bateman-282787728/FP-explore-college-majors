3524422,5,B001D3963K,"I fell in love with this History Channel program several years ago, when I would catch it on television.  Now, I am proud to say that I own this collection.  The historical information surrounding the history of each weapon is both reliable and entertaining.  The narration is superb, clearly audible and pleasing to the ear.  After watching most of the episodes in this collection, I have noticed that the show does not necessarily glamorize firearms, but gives a fair assessment of their historical significance and place in time.  It is a great collection both for its entertainment value as well as its informational value.

The packaging is also nice, with all of the discs in individual cases, two discs per case.  The menus on each disc are easy to navigate, allowing the viewer to select clearly identifiable segments of each particular show.  For any fan of history, firearms, or both, this collection is a must.",1242172800,7,921,4.896774193548387
3524423,4,B001D3963K,"I wish they would make more of these shows. They were very informative and entertaining to watch.  As a collector, I really like the background and history on the designers, engineering, politics, companies, and work events related to each subject.  I am glad that I can watch there whenever I want now. There is too much info to remember it all.",1232928000,4,346,4.655737704918033

I'm not normally a fan of history, but this set is well worth it.  Fascinating, accurate.  Watch one episode and you'll be hooked.  It's that good.",1324684800,,163,4.551724137931035
8291501,5,B001D3963K,"I'm a huge fan of this series and actually bought the entire set of Tales of the Gun episodes on video back when they were $14.99 a pop. Each episode focuses on a fascinating niche of firearms history. There are clearly episodes that one finds to be more interesting. Guns of Winchester, Guns of Remington, etc. However, I was surprised to find the episode on artillery pieces to be my favorite of them all. I believe that episode was just called Big Guns. This is the value of purchasing a set like this, you're bound to pick up all sorts of new information that you hadn't noticed before.
The only minor issue with the series that I think will get on the hardcore gun nut's nerves is the inconsistancies. There aren't many, but they are noticeable. For instance, the speakers on the program make reference to ""the gun that you could load on Sunday and shoot all week."" They first attribute this moniker to the Henry rifle, then later someone else attributes it to one of the Winchesters. There's several interviews in the series with the writer of Dirty Harry, who is also a gun advocate. At one point, he attempts to recite the famous lines on Dirty Harry when Clint Eastwood asks the robber if he feel's lucky, etc. He completely botches the lines.
These minor flaws aside, I could easily watch this series over and over again. This is some classic edu-tainment that leaves you much smarter about the subject matter.",1323302400,,1420,4.616600790513834
8291502,5,B001D3963K,"This is a great DVD set for the gun aficionado in the house.  The pistols, rifles, and automatic weapons that made history from the US, Russia, Israel, Germany, UK, Japan and more.  From all the different time periods, revolutionary war, civil war, old west. WWI, WWII, up to modern times.  Also the manufacturers stories, the weapon designers stories.  A wealth of firearm history is contained in this set. Highly recommended.",1312675200,,427,5.057142857142857
8291503,5,B001D3963K,"I've seen many of these shows on the History Channel, and found them to be entertaining and informative.  The DVD collection is well made.  Each episode provided with relevant chapters to enable one to jump into it at for a specific item of interest.  Additionally, each DVD is arranged with related episodes being grouped together, rather than simply copying them onto the DVDs in the orginal order in which they were shown on the History Channel.

A number of reviews have commented negatively on the video quality.  I find that they present themselves just fine on my 64"" TV.  Yes, they are a tad grainy and obviously not shot in HD, but the video qualtity does not really impair the viewing experience, and they are certainly light-years ahead of VHS.",1307836800,2,755,4.769230769230769
8291504,4,B001D3963K,"I first saw these episodes of ""Tales of the Gun"" way back when they were freshly released on the History Channel.  I really enjoyed them then, and really enjoyed re-watching them in this DVD set.  The set presents a lot of interesting information about guns and their history and does it without bias.  Truly enjoyable.  Be aware, though, that this set was produced back in 1998.  So, the shows are just the SD stuff (not HD) aired back then.  Also, there's a bit of repetition across the episodes in some of the material presented.  That's understandable since the episodes were made for television with weeks and months between similar material.  But, in a DVD set where you might watch several episodes at a sitting, the duplication, occasionally, can get a bit irksome.  One other thing that I'd liked to have seen in the series is a little more of a technical focus:  show exactly how the mechanisms of the guns work, explain the chemistry of the various ""gun-powders,"" compare and contrast the various bullet calibers, describe how the guns were forged/manufactured and how the metallurgy and manufacturing technology of the day limited the designs, etc..  Again, since this was a History Channel series, I can understand the focus on the historical development.  But, an occasional bit of technology would be nice.

Still, all-in-all, this is an informative, well-produced series and I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.  If the schools were smart, they'd be playing this series in their history classes.",1306281600,4,1517,4.875
8291505,4,B001D3963K,"I absolute love this show.  It is so refreshing to watch a TV program that does not sensationalize or demonize firearms.  Anyway, all the episodes are here.  The only reason why I'm not giving this boxed set a full five stars is because the production value is very low.  I'm not referring to the lack of features, which it doesn't have any by the way, but rather the poor video quality.  They did a terrible transfer job.  I wasn't looking for HD quality, but then it again I wasn't expecting VHS (on slower REC speeds) either.  Anyway, I picked up this DVD set new for $40.  At that price, it's a real bargain and well worth the time for any gun enthusiast who has any interest in history at all.",1286323200,,698,4.315384615384615
