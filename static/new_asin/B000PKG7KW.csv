2824904,1,B000PKG7KW,"The topic was of interest to me but I was very disappointed in the way the documentary was delivered. I often could not understand what the individuals were saying (subtitles are necessary). Also, there were many scenes of different places and events that I had no clue as to where and what they were. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this to anyone.",1461888000,,354,4.725806451612903

2824908,2,B000PKG7KW,"It was nice seeing unseen old footage but there were long periods with no narration to explain the context of the photos. With little to n narration, it left me to guess and caused my old brain to wander off.",1455580800,,208,4.225
2824909,3,B000PKG7KW,"Good facts, explaining how the war started.",1455580800,,43,5.285714285714286
2824910,2,B000PKG7KW,"If you don't have a pretty good knowledge of the whole scene behind what's portrayed here you will often wonder what's going on.  Fortunately I do so I could fill in the blanks, of which there were more than any ""documentary"" I have ever seen.  Lots of non-sequiturs, visual and musical.  A story that needs to be told (the suffering and bravery of the Czechs) but told very poorly and disjointedly.
Incomplete even in it's stated intent, hard to follow, vague.",1452384000,,461,4.666666666666667

2824917,2,B000PKG7KW,"The title of this film makes it sound so intriguing!  I will watch anything having to do with WWII or The Holocaust, but this film is a travesty.  There is hardly any real content.  And using footage from a Hollywood movie as a reenactment of Heydrich was not only out of place, but added to the poor production value.

And you are better than me if you understood everything that the CZ soldiers were saying, and my grandmother was from Slovakia!",1445558400,2,447,4.481481481481482

2824919,2,B000PKG7KW,No the best I've seen not the worst either but definitely a waste of time to watch,1444867200,3,82,3.8823529411764706
2824920,2,B000PKG7KW,"The description on Amazon makes this sound like an exciting picture.  It is not!  It is, first of all, badly in need of subtitles to understand the testimonies.  Also, it is not as described on Amazon.  I would title it ""Czechoslovakia in WWII"" or something as bland as that.  I expected something very different.",1444694400,3,313,4.722222222222222

2824922,5,B000PKG7KW,"If you watch a lot of WWII documentaries, this film may seem boring. However, for those interested in a film that has more of a Czechoslovakian focus, this would be it.",1444176000,,168,4.451612903225806

8192114,3,B000PKG7KW,I have seen better movies dealing with the subject and I've seen worse. I'm always interested in real life scenes and commentaries from people who survived that terrible time in history. Worth watching for  history and WWII buffs.,1474848000,,230,5.052631578947368
8192115,3,B000PKG7KW,"I really wanted to like this program, but it seemed too uneven at times. It glossed over important historical events relevant to the story and then focused on other things too much. However, the interviews with ex-Czechoslovak soldiers was worth watching. These patriots are rarely given the chance to tell their incredible stories.",1473984000,,332,5.283018867924528
8192116,2,B000PKG7KW,"There are too many documentaries that will be thought provoking, informative or inspiring to waste your time on this one.",1472947200,,121,5.1
8192117,1,B000PKG7KW,Not very good.  It's more like a home movie.  As someone who is very interested in the events covered in the documentary it was hard to follow and rambling.,1471737600,,156,4.344827586206897

8192120,2,B000PKG7KW,"This topic is of great interest to me,especially after having spent a short time living in Prague and hearing about this historical incident. Unfortunately, this documentary was disjointed, repetitive and didn't even cover what the description promised. The opening was especially strange and seemed to take forever to get to the story. It did eventually get to the assassination and aftermath, but it didn't provide any information or insight beyond the little bit that I already knew. Very disappointing and hard to follow.",1466121600,,525,5.337349397590361
8192121,2,B000PKG7KW,"It has some interesting information and video but it's very poorly done and edited.  There are several scenes without words, which is fine if it tells a story, but there are times when one has no idea what the scene is about.",1465257600,,225,4.357142857142857
