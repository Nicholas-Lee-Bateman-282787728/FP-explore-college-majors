5053521,4,B0073U2ETK,"A quick search online indicates that The Wicker Tree is in  eminent danger of being buried in a sea of middling to bad notices, and that is a real shame, for while the film is certainly flawed, it is nevertheless a unique and valuable piece of storytelling.

First, we must do away with the looming shadow of its predecessor: The Wicker Man it is most decidedly not - but then, what is? If one judges The Wicker Tree on its paucity of similarities to its spiritual forbear, then one will naturally consider it a failure simply because it was never intended to faithfully recreate the original film in the first place. The Wicker Tree, rather, is a black comedy/commentary painted in bold strokes that deals not in the nature of sacrifice, but in the nature of the various roles we play throughout our lives, and whether we are guided by or can avoid not faith, but fate.

Young former country-pop singer Beth Boothby (Brittania Nicol) has rejected her debauched, secular and trashy (literally, check the lyrics) music and image to embrace evangelical Christianity and folksier, mostly religious tunes. Together with her cowboy fiancee Steve (Henry Garrett) and their matching purity rings, she's on her way to Scotland (a country that was all but entirely Christian before North America was even discovered) to witness to those kilted heathens who - horror of horrors! - don't even believe in angels.

(Side note: that most critics seem to have missed the fact that The Wicker Tree is a black comedy playing on and with broad stereotypes even after having the above setup literally spelled out for them in the first ten minutes of the film is beyond me.)

It is in Scotland that Beth meets Lord Lachlan Morrison and his wife, Lady Delia (Graham McTavish and the criminally underused Jacqueline Leonard), and the wheel of fate is set inexorably in motion. Beth and Steve demonstrate time and again that they are not only naive, but also not intellectually equipped to engage in matters of philosophy or any faith other than their own, and so both fail utterly to sense the danger surrounding them. Interestingly, despite their intellectual disparity, Lachlan has an inner struggle that almost parallels Beth's - against who they were, who they are, and what they desire to be. While Beth struggles to live down her ignoble past, Lachlan faces questions about the nature and sincerity of his faith in the present, and rightly so, for it seems that, as owner of the local nuclear plant, he is fully cognizant of the fact that it is most likely his own business that has caused local birth rates to drop precipitously, though publicly he insists that he and his followers need only find the right sacrifice to solve their reproductive ills.

Betrayals of self, faith and others like these abound in The Wicker Tree. Steve is easily lead astray by local seductress Lolly (a stunning Honeysuckle Weeks), convincing him that he has failed both as man and a Christian. Lolly in turn attempts not once but twice to betray her fellow cultists while Lachlan all but admits to his wife his faith has abandoned him. It is Beth, however, who finally demonstrates most savagely that fate, not faith, rules this universe, as she betrays her own evangelical ideals in a moment of anger and despair.

Philosophical undercurrents aside, another question on a lot of minds seems to be whether or not this is a standard ""horror"" film. The answer is...complicated. It is at least as much a horror film as The Wicker Man, though by today's standards, neither film is stictly ""horror"" at all. The Wicker Tree does have horror elements, but also comedy elements and musical elements - more important than what genre to slot it into is that it is not always successful at blending all those genres, and that is in part why I concede that it is flawed.

Foremost among these flaws? It is unfortunately true that casting two unknowns in the lead roles was a gamble that did not entirely pay off. Nicol and Garrett both give some truly stilted line readings, but these moments in no way overshadow the film as whole. One would have liked to have seen the aforementioned parallels between Beth and Lachlan better defined, but they and other subplots remain underutilized. Finally, the shoestring budget is unfortunately very much evident in some of the cinematography and editing, but save for one scene in which Steve seems to doing some kind one-man see-saw act, the issues are minor and not overly distracting.

To sum up: Imperfect, but with a unique story and philosophical core. Put The Wicker Man out of your mind and give The Wicker Tree a shot strictly on its own merits. You will almost certainly find something to like.",1335398400,33,4700,4.799752781211372
5053522,5,B0073U2ETK,"This quasi sequel to the original film is a hilarious retelling, full of the b movie charm you loved the first time round, but now with less intelligence.",1335398400,3,154,4.535714285714286
5053523,3,B0073U2ETK,"Just saw it on DVD...the criticism made by other reviewers of the two leads is on point. Towards the beginning, there is a scene showing a container of dead mice, and that's a good metaphor for the protagonists. They are trapped and manipulated, never matching wits with their captors. I could not connect with them at all, and that is the weakest component of what otherwise is a pretty good movie experience.

The feel of this film matches ""The Wicker Man"" at times, but perhaps it tries too hard to emulate the best of what the original had to offer. The moments of black comedy, the Scottish landscape, the Scottish folk songs, and some of the supporting cast add a lot of positives. However, the film pacing is too quick to build up the suspense found in ""The Wicker Man.""

Bottom line, my expectations were low. The original ""Wicker Man"" is absolutely amazing, any sequel was likely to fall short. Watching this film, craft and care were put into it, and it shows. Even with its flaws, it is definitely worth a rental.",1335225600,4,1024,4.590163934426229
5053524,1,B0073U2ETK,"Nearly forty years after the original The Wicker Man film, writer and director Robin Hardy's follow-up The Wicker Tree has now been released on DVD and Blu-ray. To make things kind of confusing, The Wicker Tree is the second part of a proposed Wicker Man Trilogy, but isn't a direct sequel and only explores similar themes (Paganism in a modern world) as The Wicker Man. Can you imagine waiting another thirty or forty years for another sequel though? After seeing this, it probably wouldn't be a bad thing if that last film (The Wrath of the Gods) never sees the light of day.

I never saw the original The Wicker Man film, but I did however see the remake that Nicolas Cage starred in. While Hardy has completely distanced himself from the remake and it is literally one of the worst films of all time, I can't help but feel like it's one of the greatest unintentional comedies ever. Seriously just watch that Youtube clip of the most ridiculous scenes and you'll see what I'm talking about. Cage beats up a young girl, draws a gun on a woman on a bicycle, punches an old woman in the face, wears a bear costume, and punches some more women in the face. Then there are the bees. Oh my goodness, the bees. Nicolas Cage, you have outdone yourself sir.

Considering how both terrible and accidentally hilarious the remake was I could just never bring myself to watch the original film. The Wicker Tree doesn't really help sway me to rush out and change that decision either. Beth Boothby (Brittania Nicol) is a born again Christian pop singer. Her and her fianc Steve (Henry Garrett) wear purity rings and take joy in trying to convert non-believers. Their church group, the ""Cowboys for Christ,"" send them to Scotland to preach with the promise of a wedding so grand that even Jesus' eyes would explode at the mere sight of its stupendousness. Sir Lachlan Morrison (Graham McTavish) and Delia Morrison (Jacqueline Leonard) invite Beth and Steve to the town of Tressock to share their word of the Lord, but their May Day celebrations turn out to be much more than what either Beth or Steve signed up for.

The Wicker Tree is stupid. There, I said it. I realize The Wicker Man is a cult classic and I don't have any room to talk or try to tarnish that (yet), but this is just not a good movie at all. The acting is bad by the two leads, the storyline is tiresome, and there just isn't really anything redeemable about viewing the film. The corny dialogue begins near the beginning of the film in Beth and Steve's hotel room. Are they meant to sound idiotic because they're from Texas? If I was from here, I might find that offensive. Both Beth and Steve claim to do everything for God, but both either give in to the first signs of temptation or eventually let wrath overcome them.

Seeing how stupid both Beth and Steve are didn't sit well with me either. Steve makes terrible decisions throughout the movie before refusing to listen to multiple warnings laid out in front him while Beth refuses to listen to or believe anything that's happening even after it's all laid out in front of her.

It all just feels very familiar like you've seen it all before. The juggling between Christianity and Paganism is kind of interesting, but I feel like if a devout Christian watched the film they'd consider it blasphemous. One of the reasons I'm not a religious person is because many of the individuals I've known in my lifetime who have claimed to be Christian did things six days a week that were very non-Christian-like, but because they went to church on Sunday that made everything balance out. The Wicker Tree seemed to kind of expand on that concept. Was that its purpose? Probably not, but that's how I related to it.

While Christopher Lee was originally intended to play Sir Lachlan Morrison, the cast was shuffled around when Lee injured his back on the set of another film. Lee does make a cameo, but don't get your hopes up. He basically critiques a painting and talks about religion a bit before never being seen again. There was far too much of Lolly's (Honeysuckle Weeks) promiscuousness to show off and Lachlan's ramblings to hear.

Even without seeing the original film, it's easy to tell that Robin Hardy has basically just trampled familiar ground here. It feels like he just made the same film again with different people and a few things altered before publicly admitting that he still prefers his original film. You can see nearly every major moment coming from a mile away. The Wicker Tree is predictable, pointless, and above all else unnecessary.

Special features on the Blu-ray include a twelve minute ""The Making of The Wicker Tree"" featurette with cast interviews and behind the scenes footage. They discuss how important the music is in the film to the story, what it was like working with Robin Hardy, favorite scenes, and even what they'd classify the film as. There's also nearly twelve minutes of deleted scenes (most of them being extended versions of scenes in the film) and the trailer.

The Wicker Tree will be released on single disc DVD and Blu-ray tomorrow, April 24th. The film is rated R for sexuality, nudity, and violence, presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio in Dolby True HD 5.1 (English) and Mono (Spanish), and is available with English subtitles. It is approximately 96 minutes in length. The Wicker Tree will be available in most retail outlets and online stores.",1335139200,4,5416,4.674711437565582
5053525,3,B0073U2ETK,"I saw ""the Wicker Tree"" during it's very limited theatrical run stateside and must say I went in with very low expectations. First, the original ""Wicker Man"" starring Edward Woodward is a cult classic that introduces lots of interesting ideas on faith and morality until it reaches the shocking conclusion. One should not even consider the horrendous Nicholas Cage remake. So with those thought one had to wonder what did Robin Hardy - director of the original British film have to add to his ""wicker"" mythos? The answer? Not much. Having said that this film isn't a total retread nor a true sequel and offers enough new stuff to entertain.

The main plot involves 2 American Missionaries who come to Scotland to witness. One a pop star turned born again Christian singer and her devout cowboy fiance. Having a tough time trying to witness the 2 are persuaded to visit a smaller town where the villagers might be more open to Christ's message than the big city folk in Edinburgh. Of course if you've seen the original Wicker Man you know our 2 young people are in danger as the motives of the villagers is less than friendly.
The town is celebrating its May Day celebration culminating in celebration involving the wicker tree. While I won't give away the ending if you think this is going to end like the wicker man than you can expect to be surprised.

The acting is a bit over the top particularly in the characterization of the eager Christian missionaries. There is a strange mix of black humor with the villagers that mixes with the scary and downright ridiculous. I'm glad this film wasn't a total rehash of the wicker man story and did try to do something different. At the end of the film I found I actually enjoyed this movie but also left with the understanding of why many people would not.

Overall, interesting story with some over the top acting. The ending is a bit anti-climatic but overall a interesting viewing- if only one time.",1334361600,4,1948,4.656976744186046

When young born again Christians Beth (Nicol) and Steve (Garrett) are sent to Scotland to spread the word of the Lord.

As many of you know I am not a fan of Nicholas Cage at all and because of that I have not seen the re-make of ""The Wicker Man"" or the original (because my hatred runs that deep). Going in I was glad it was not a Cage movie but still very skeptical especially after reading the reviews for it. With the benefit of not seeing any of the others I was not as disappointed in this as others were. I actually really liked it. The biggest problem is that the beginning was good and as it went on it got better and better...before hitting a wall.

5053531,1,B0073U2ETK,"The Wicker Tree is a semi-sequel to The Wicker Man, and by that I mean the original, 1973 film, not the God-awful Nic Cage 2006 remake.  The film is written and directed by Robin Hardy, the man who directed the original film so theres definitely a nice pedigree to start with, but unfortunately theres not much else.

A former Britney Spears-style pop star, now turned Christian Evangelist singer Beth Boothby, is sent on a mission along with her cowboy boyfriend Steve to Scot to preach the gospel of the Lord.  Once there they meet Lord and Lady Morrison who greet them warmly but almost immediately reveal their insidious plans for the two hayseeds from Texas, robbing the film of any hint of suspense.  The villagers go out of their way to be nice but Beth and Steve seem to be the only ones who cant figure out that the village is looking at them like hungry diners eyeing a turkey on Thanksgiving.  They share with Beth and Steve the myths of their Celtic Goddess Sulis which the pair of Christians find reprehensible.

We basically know what will eventually happen to the pair about 20 minutes into the film and thus have to sit through nearly an hour Beth singing hymns and the villagers singing Scottish folk songs while Steve begins to have a crisis of faith after being tempted by the local shrew.  The impression leaves you with the feeling that Hardy has a rather low opinion of Americans, lumping us all into the category of being slang-talking rednecks and simpletons.  The intimation is that they could not find any locals stupid enough to be duped into being a sacrifice for a pagan ceremony so they decided to get a couple of dumb cowpokes.

The Wicker Tree is especially disappointing in light of the terrible Wicker Man remake from which Hardy completely distanced himself.  Youve have thought this was going to be his triumphant reply to the remake, particularly since its been 21 years since his last film.  But in the end the film falls with a quiet and dull thud.  The only saving grace is a cameo by the great Christopher Lee, who starred in the original movie, playing a similar but different character.",1438387200,,2129,4.648

Two Texas born-again innocents go to Scotland, with bad Texas twangs, to convert the heathen and naturally things unravel from there.  It's interesting how these born-agains quickly forget their beliefs, readily agreeing to participate in what is obviously a pagan festival as the May Queen and Laddie.  It's sort of pathetic, Christopher Lee must have really needed the money to do what is basically a cameo role in this film.  I kept watching to see how they would each meet their predictable end, but spent most of the time wondering who Brittania Nicol was and if someone actually believed she had talent when they cast her in the role of one of the two Texas born-again bumpkins.

In ""The Wicker Tree"", two born-again Texas evangelicals are sent to Scotland, where they are quickly targeted by a Celtic cult for human sacrifice.  As in ""Wicker Man"", the first 70 minutes or so are a black comedy with music, until the last 20 minutes take a turn into horror.  As in ""Wicker Man"", the cult is presided over by a charismatic businessman in a tweed blazer, who likes to surround himself with naked pagan women.  As in ""Wicker Man"", the representatives of Christianity are outgunned and outmaneuvered at every turn.

But that's where the comparison ends.  ""Wicker Man"" (the original, with Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee) is a deep movie with an eclectic folk score, gorgeous cinematography, literate dialogue (check out any of the moral debates by Woodward and Lee throughout the film), and airtight plotting that makes the film rewarding even after multiple viewings.  Bear in mind, of course, that Robin Hardy directed, but did not write, ""Wicker Man"".  He is, sadly, not up to the task of writing this thematic sequel.

Hardy has been trying for years to get ""Wicker Tree"" made, with various big names attached over the years, and with the script published as a novel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cowboys-for-Christ/dp/1905222416/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cowboys for Christ</a>) first.  Funding repeatedly fell through; the film was not made until 2009, and has yet to achieve cinematic wide release in the US.  Due to Christopher Lee's ill health at the time, he is here relegated to a single scene, shot on green-screen, where he recites nonsensical dialogue -- he's implied to be the same character, Lord Summerisle, that he played in the original film, but his scene comes up so late that you really won't care.

The problems with ""Wicker Tree"" are legion.  The two American leads are neither well-written nor well-acted -- no true door-knocking Evangelical would be this inept at answering pointed questions about their own faith.  Most of the scenes in the remote Scottish village are meant to be black comedy but just aren't funny, and don't make a whole lot of sense.  Graham McTavish (taking over for Lee, and just before he was cast as Dwalin in the ""Hobbit"" movies) is pretty good as the cult leader, and someone named Honeysuckle Weeks spends most of the movie topless, in an amalgam of the roles played by Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt in the original.  But the ending is utterly punchless -- instead of a climactic showdown between Woodward and Lee, trading rapid-fire religious barbs on the cliffs of Summerisle, with the Wicker Man waiting just over the next hill, here one of the Evangelicals is literally too dumb to realize what's happening to them, and the other's fate is presented in such a poorly-cut montage that I'm still not sure what the point of all that was.

Had ""Wicker Tree"" come first -- if it didn't have an identical plot structure and themes to ""Wicker Man"" -- I doubt it would have have inspired such devotion among filmgoers, or two remakes.  There are some good moments (almost anytime McTavish and Weeks are on screen, him wearing Christopher Lee's blazer from the original and her wearing nothing), but there's no real psychological horror to accompany the gore of the final 20 minutes.  This movie will not stay with you, apart from the resentment that you're not getting those 96 minutes of your life back.

Now that my rant is over, let me just say that I believe these to be unfair in their judgment.

The Wicker Man was a spectacular film (the original and not the Nicolas Cage sewer pickle). The Wicker Tree is also a great movie. I will say that it is not on the same level but it does have a lot of merit on its own. There's a different feel in the fact that this is a black comedy. If you go into this with an open mind I think you may find a film that's entertaining, chilling and quite funny at times. I do wish there had been more detail in the pagan rites and customs but that's just me speaking as a pagan.  Overall I say give it a try.

5053558,3,B0073U2ETK,"Nearly forty years after the release of the cult classic THE WICKER MAN, director Robin Hardy has returned to the screen with a ""spiritual sequel"" entitled THE WICKER TREE, as adapted from his own novel Cowboys for Christ.

Betty and Steve embark on a trip to Scotland to perform missionary work in the name of Jesus, where they are invited to preach the gospel in the small and hedonistic town of Tressock by the leading lord and lady. Their good nature quickly betrays them when they are fooled into playing the parts of the Queen of the May and her Laddie in the upcoming May Day celebration, a pagan ritual that will be used to restore feracity to the land.

THE WICKER TREE suffers invariably from its connection to the original film, which forces unfair comparisons between the two. Expectations will be set exceedingly high as a result, which may initially lead to an uncharitable response from the existing fan base. There is much at work in THE WICKER TREE, however, between the cynical humor, religious banter, musical interlacing, slight eroticism, and underlying suspense. Hardy takes a risk in delivering another artful suspense piece in light of the drastic changes the film-going public has undergone over the years, but one that should inevitably pay off.

Having said that, THE WICKER TREE is far from perfect. Betty and Steve never strike a chord with the audience. They are far too gullible, and their characters are portrayed as shallow caricatures of Southern rubes. This was surely intended as part of the film's playful stab at Christianity, but the suspense suffers when the pair are lead like lambs to the slaughter. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Sir Lachlan Morrison and the townspeople of Tressock reveal their malintent far too soon, which takes away from the mystery and intrigue inherent in the original. In this way, Hardy may be playing against the viewer's familiarity with THE WICKER MAN, letting them in on the joke from the very beginning.

Graham McTavish steps in for Christopher Lee as Morrison, the charismatic leader of Tressock. He is a worthy successor, and delivers a powerful performance. Likewise, Honeysuckle Weeks places the audience under her spell as the seductive Lolly. Brittania Nicol and Henry Garrett are all too convincing as Betty and Steve, with their performances becoming the source of much ridicule. The line between innocence and idiocy has unfortunately been crossed, as there is very little irony to be found in either of their portrayals.

THE WICKER TREE revisits the musical traditions set forth in THE WICKER MAN, but with far less success. The gospel singing of Betty and Steve lacks the emotional discourse and intensity of tracks like ""Willow's Song"" or ""Gently Johnny,"" which had a tremendous impact in driving the plot and luring a one Sergeant Howie into temptation. The continued use of music does give the film a unique identity in the midst of modern Horror.

What we are left with is a mixed bag overall: too serious to be taken as an outright comedy, and too soft for satire. As a ""spiritual sequel,"" fans will surely revel in the familiar themes that are embedded in the film, but THE WICKER TREE stands in the shadow of Hardy's earlier success.

5053559,3,B0073U2ETK,"This movie stands a bit as a sequel to Robin Hardy's (1973) ""The wicker man"".  Both movies share the fact that foreigners come to a Scottish little town where local people practice ancient Celtic cults, including a May sacrifice to attain people's fertility. It is difficult not to criticize this movie when compared with ""The wicker man"", but I will try to be fair. On this new version, a young couple is attracted to a Scotland's small community so that they can evangelize the locals with their Catholic message. As in the first movie, the locals had a ""different plan"" for these foreigners, but this time, without much surprise to the viewers. Thus this new version looks much more like an ok Stephen Kings's tale, so it may appease shoppers looking for this type of films. In my view, this film lacks the interesting British atmosphere of 1970s horror or drama movies. However, Hardy uses the two main characters to laugh about relatively ignorant or illiterate fellows coming from ignorant places using Bible writings to convert others. By the way, those (like me) wishing to watch Christopher Lee once again will have him on screen during a 1-2 out of the 92 min of the entire movie!

Technically, the 92 min movie comes in a nice widescreen format and very good digital transfer.  English and Spanish subtitles are provided as well.",1356739200,,1340,4.792207792207792
5053560,1,B0073U2ETK,"""The Wicker Tree,"" which had been in the planning stages for years under one title or another, might actually be a worse movie than the 2006 American remake of it's predecessor, ""The Wicker Man,"" which Nicolas Cage will never live down.  Written and directed by Robin Hardy, who made the 1973 original, it rather closely follows the storyline of ""The Wicker Man,"" though with new characters, and with a new central problem faced by the inhabitants of the Scottish village, which they need to solve through an unusual rite.  But while ""The Wicker Man"" is a fascinating, brilliantly rendered thriller, ""The Wicker Tree"" pretty much just lays there in a puddle of confusion.  This time around, two brainless, betrothed, born-again Christian missionaries, played by Henry Garett and Brittania Nicol, travel to a Scottish village where rumors of paganism abound, to perform (she's a singer) and proselytize.  But of course, once they get there, the villagers are really in control.  Most of the characters in ""The Wicker Tree"" have parallels from ""The Wicker Man"" (Honeysuckle Weeks's ""Lolly"" is the original's ""Willow,"" without the great production number), but what's missing is a sense of character motivation.  Also missing is any sense of suspense, mystery, or that semi-surrealistic atmosphere that makes the original so fascinating.  Graham McTavish is good in the role of the village laird, a part that parallels Christopher Lee's ""Lord Summerisle"" in the original, and Weeks also manages to inhabit a largely unmotivated role.  Lee himself shows up in a needless and pointless flashback cameo, in which he may or may not be the elderly Lord Summerisle.  The rest of the cast is just there, though Clive Russell as a put-upon servant manages some over-the-top hamming in a scene involving an injury to his person that seems to have come from a different movie altogether.  Director Hardy manages a few sequences that are atmospherically reminiscent of the original, but practically every foot of this film is undercut by the awful, totally inappropriate musical score by John Scott.  I don't know what picture Scott thought he was scoring, but it wasn't this one.  The picture's other main liability is the woefully amateurish performance of Brittania Nicol in the crucial role of ""Beth Boothby"" (and the character name alone makes one wonder if this thing was supposed to be taken seriously in the first place). Both as an actor and a singer, she is quite dreadful, so much so that I can only hope no viewer of ""The Wicker Tree"" will be drinking anything during the scene when she fervently thanks God for her ""wonderful voice.""  Whatever it is will come through their nose.  I went into this film knowing it was not well received, but still hoping to find SOMETHING about it to like.  Except for a couple well-staged sequences, a wry line every now and then, and a rather disturbing (if somewhat nonsensical) ending, there isn't much.  This is a major disappointment.",1355788800,,2972,5.010162601626016
5053561,4,B0073U2ETK,"Forty years ago, The Wicker Man came out.  It starred Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward, and Britt Ekland.  Woodward played a policeman searching for a missing girl.  His investigation led him to a small island, off the coast of Scotland.  At first, the locals were ambivalent to his questioning.  He decides to stay at a local inn to continue his search.  Eventually, he meets Lord Summerisle, who serves as the leader of the community.  With his aid, and that of a local girl, he continues to dig into the mysterious circumstances surrounding the missing person.

The Wicker Tree is not a direct sequel.  Although it was said that Christopher Lee was originally scheduled to reprise his role as Lord Summerisle.  Joan Collins was also said to have been originally asked to play the role of Lord Summerisle's wife.  In any case, The Wicker Tree is a spiritual sequel to the first film.  It was adapted from Robin Hardy's novel, Cowboys for Christ.  The movie follows the travels of two christian evangelists from Texas as they try to spread the message of Jesus to the population of a small, isolated community in Scotland.  The reception they receive is somewhat lukewarm, as the people do not seem keen on learning about christianity.  The local nobility (Lord Morrison and his wife) seemed cordial enough, however.  Having invited the young christian couple (Beth and Steve) to stay at their estate as guests.  While there, Steve meets up with Lolly.  Lolly is the sexy, flirtatious head groom of the Morrison stables.  She seduces Steve and they end up sleeping together in the woods.

Beth starts to notice strange behavior among their hosts, as well as the locals, prompting her to do some digging.  It turns out that the locals practice their own Celtic-based religion.  A local festival, the May Day celebrations, are coming up.  Tradition has it that a chosen young female is given the honor of playing the ""Queen of the May"", and a young man is chosen to play the ""Laddie"".  The Laddie basically is a person on horseback who will attempt to elude mounted riders who are in pursuit, fox hunt style.  Beth and Steve agree to play the respective roles, not knowing that the consequences can bring danger.  It turns out that the locals belong to an ancient cult.  Anyway, I do not want to spoil the plot for you.  Let's just say the plot will take an unexpected direction and take you by surprise.

In any case, this is actually a pretty good movie.  The original certainly has developed its own cult following over the past decades and perhaps this  one will also.  Graham McTavish plays the role of Lord Morrison, while Jacqueline Leonard plays his wife, Lady Morrison.  Henry Garrett and Brittania Nicol play the parts of the evangelists couple from Texas.  Honeysuckle Weeks plays the sexy Lolly.

What is good about this film?  The plot is pretty good.  And, if you love horses, the fox hunt scene is terrific.  This is one of the better depictions of a fox hunt in a movie that I have watched.  Plenty of good riding to watch.  And a nude Honeysuckle Weeks is just the icing on the cake!  Worth your time, definitely.",1350345600,,3129,4.720370370370371

Aside from the shallow and insipid performance by Brittania Nicole, the acting was all solid and brought more depth than the poor writing really allows for. Having said that, however, everything else about this film is atrocious.
The writing is unimaginative, derivative and formulaic. Rather than another deep look into the ancient pagan practices of Brittain, the writer chooses to revisit mayday with only the skimpiest overlay of paganism and feels entitled to simply make up practices that never were. Not as openly offensive and imaginary as the Nicholas Cage dog of a remake, it is the death knell of the Wicker Man franchise, nonetheless. Had the writer bothered to read Stations of the Sun by Ronald Hutton, or indeed any of his work, he would have had ample material to supply a triumphant work that continues in the vein of the original.
With the absolute wealth of scholarship, ancient pagan sites and a pagan community fairly bursting at the seams with talented writers, artists and musicians, it boggles the mind how such a great opportunity could have been bungled so badly. I can only hope that more serious film makers will pick up the torch lit by the original Film and continue to explore this new genre with both respect and creativity.",1345420800,7,1349,4.793991416309013

Since it was from the 70s it seemed to carry a certain psychedelic quality as well. The remake of the Wicker Man with Nicholas Cage at least attempted to capture the dangerous and mystic qualities of its predecessor. The Wicker tree on the other hand, is at its best, a B-movie. No magic, no mystery, predictable, and conspicuously unfunny in its attempt at ribald humor. It makes me sad that this film was more a tribute to a burning man festival than to ancient religion and its timeless mysteries. I am not a religious person but I tire of the sophomoric arguments made for and against Christianity. Portraying Christians as bumpkins is ridiculous. Portraying pagans as tedious, impish and evil is equally as insulting. Altogether, this film is shallow and cursory when it needed to be more mystic and primal.
Finally, I recognized several British actors for which I have a great deal of respect. One has to wonder how badly they actually need to work to find themselves in this hideous mess.

5053573,3,B0073U2ETK,"THE WICKER TREE is the long awaited companion film to Robin Hardy's famous horror film, THE WICKER MAN. THE WICKER TREE is set in 2010.  Recording artist Beth Boothy (Brittania Nicol) and her fiance, Steve (Henry Garrett), are leaving Texas for a two-year missionary journey to Scotland. Beth is a former country-pop musician who has now become a famous Christian music singer. When she and Steve arrive in Scotland they are hounded by media and her performance at the host church makes the local television news. Two people at that performance are Lord Lachlan Morrison (Graham McTavish) and his wife Lady Delia (Jacqueline Leonard). The Morrisons believe they have found the ""special"" pair of individuals that they have been looking for. After Beth and Steve's door-to-door evangelistic efforts are met with harsh resistance, they accept an offer from the Morrisons to visit their village and speak with the townspeople there. Despite being followers of a pagan religion, everyone in the village is extremely friendly to both Beth and Steve and are interested in listening to them and watching Beth perform. Lord Lachlan offers to make Beth the Queen of May and Steve the Laddie of May. In an attempt to impress the locals and better witnessing opportunities, they agree. However, things aren't exactly what they appear to be and the veneer of kindness worn by the locals is a mask that hides their true intentions.

I really enjoyed THE WICKER MAN. The ending of that film is one that is truly horrifying. It's a movie that will stick with you long after you've seen it.

THE WICKER TREE shares some basic themes with THE WICKER MAN, but it is a different work. THE WICKER MAN was more of a serious drama with elements of mystery and suspense and some horror. THE WICKER TREE contains some of those threads, but it's more of a dark comedy. In fact, if it wasn't for the last fifteen-twenty minutes of the movie, THE WICKER TREE would be a farcical version of that previous film. The featured characters in the film actually begin as caricatures instead of characters. For example, for most of the film Beth and Steve are just full of clichs and some untruths about Christians; they enter the ""mission field"" not knowing their own faith. On the other hand, most of the other characters begin as caricatures, too. For example, when Lord Lachlan and Lady Delia are at the church first watching Beth perform there are parts of their conversation that seem more like something taken from the conversation between two cartoon villains.

I think THE WICKER TREE is supposed to be a satirical (and comical) companion to THE WICKER MAN. However, due to the way the movie ends, it doesn't really work. The comic tone that has run through most of the movie is thrown away and the film turns darkly serious. The game is over. This wouldn't be an issue, except, it ruins the satire of the rest of the movie.

The biggest flaws with THE WICKER TREE is that the premise is completely unbelievable and there are too many open ends that are left unresolved at the end of the movie. For example, Beth Boothby is an international singing sensation. Everyone knew what she was doing in Scotland and if she suddenly disappeared, an investigation would take place. Why did the Morrisons choose her to be the May Queen knowing of her fame? I mean, there were girls in the village who even asked Beth for her autograph. Why was it important that the May Queen be a good singer? Were Beth and Steve really so nave that they didn't ask any questions about what being the May Queen and Laddie would entail?

Overall, though the movie shares a philosophical/spiritual foundation with THE WICKER MAN, THE WICKER TREE is a different movie that just doesn't quite work. It makes a valid attempt at being its own creature, but copies too much from the first movie in the last act. It's an entertaining movie, but one that's a disappointing.",1336953600,15,3911,4.752577319587629

8509418,5,B0073U2ETK,"Set in 2011 in Scotland. Christopher Lee fought for years to save Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man (1973) from destruction. To ensure its legendary status, Hardy wrote Cowboys for Christ as a sequel, then directed this version of it. In it two cowperson born-agains cross the Atlantic to save the souls of the heathen Scots, only to come a cropper against the living worship of Demeter. These two films should be viewed together. Lee stars again, as he did 38 years earlier; the second is dedicated to the memory of Edward Woodward (1930-2009), the sacrifice in the first; and the same powerful music drives both. If you can make your way through all the nudity and sex, consider this question: ""Can fate ever be altered?"" Lee suggests the answer.",1491177600,,743,4.767441860465116
