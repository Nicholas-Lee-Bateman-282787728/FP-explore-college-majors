8356399,4,B0028MGX3G,"Vol.#7 of Snap No Tap focuses on physical conditioning, pain tolerance, and the mental conditioning of the Cecchine catch wrestling system. The physical conditioning portion is similar to the anaerobic drills found in folk and freestyle wrestling. Cecchine has many of these drills in his Lucky 13 workout system, so I was familiar with them. The pain tolerance conditioning covered in this system has to be seen to be believed. This style of conditioning will be avoided, even dismissed by some, but it does have tremendous merit. Lastly, the mental conditioning portion of Vol. #7 shares Cecchine's philosophy on mental conditioning and mental training for life and death struggles. I found this protion interesting but did not agree with all of it. Overall, a great DVD and a fine series. I highly recommend.",1308441600,,811,5.105263157894737
