8517473,4,B007IEDFF8,"Although released as part of Director Roger Corman's Edgar Allan Poe cycle of films this film was actually from an H.P. Lovecraft novella. its only connection to  Poe is the title.  This is a very good film, filled with atmosphere, bloody deaths, and  classic Gothic horror. The script by Charles Beaumont, who wrote many episodes of The Twilight Zone, is intelligent and unsettling. Corman's direction is stylish as always; the make-up effects, showing the cursed, deformed villagers, is effective.  An eerie atmosphere presides over everything and memorably macabre moments are laced throughout, such as the scene where Vincent Price and his wife, played by Debra Paget,  are slowly surrounded by the deformed townsfolk - revealing the terrible fate that Price's ancestor condemned them to. There is a bizarre dream sequence that features villagers with misshapen faces, some with only one eye that stands out.

Vincent Price gives his usual great performance.  He was at his best as we slowly see his mind and soul being assumed by his warlock ancestor.  Debra Paget is both beautiful and formidable as Price's leading lady; unfortunately, this was her final feature film. The supporting cast was excellent and filled with great character actors, especially Lon Chaney Jr. as Price's henchman and, Frank Maxwell, Elisha Cook, Jr., Leo Gordon, John Dierkes as the villagers.

This film may not be at the top tier of the Corman/Price/Poe batch of films, but it's still highly watchable and eminently enjoyable",1409529600,,1510,5.206611570247934
