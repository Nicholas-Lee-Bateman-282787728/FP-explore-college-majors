8354221,1,B00278FSOQ,"This dvd has the same lone press interveiw as Guns N'Roses Rock Power Collection that suddenly cuts off in the middle of the interveiw. It is ONLY one interveiw that you can find on Guns N'Roses Destructive Appetite Interveiws which by the way- does have several interveiws with the entire band Axl, Slash, Duff, etc. and there is even an interveiw with Slash and Lenny Kravitz. Don't buy Behind the Curtain it is a waste of money and it is a scam because they promise several interveiws along with never before seen and rare footage chronicling the bands rise to fame! Don't believe them it is just Rock Power Collection repackaged! Save your duckets for something worth it like Destructive Appetite Interveiws. This dvd doesn't even rate one star!!!!",1250121600,3,752,4.837209302325581
