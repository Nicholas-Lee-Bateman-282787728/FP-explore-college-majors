8365104,5,B002DGS0P6,"This DVD from Timothy Richardson presents poetry instruction in a conversational style that is easy to understand..  He covers the overall importance of art and poetry and the affect art has on every generation.  Tim gives examples of the triggers that give him inspiration for his poetry.  He discusses rhyme and meter using examples from his collection of poems in ""Afflicted Love"".  He taps out the meter on a drum pad so you immediately know what he's talking about.  Each poetic style is accompanied with visualizations from some of his work with highlighted text of the key words.  Tim explains the different pentameters and talks about style used by some of the great poets of the past.

The poetry Tim selected for this DVD is emotional and a great selection from his work.  His poignant description of a struggling dog in ""A Country Dog"" touches your heart.  ""On November 22nd"", reflects on the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  ""Wrongful Life"" tells of Johnny Cochran's frustration with the legal system, and ""Pearl Harbor"" focuses on the men trapped beneath the sea in the Arizona after the bombing, just to name a few.

This program is wonderfully produced, filmed, and edited by Toni Seger who had the foresight to include the visual references of Tim's work.

This would be an excellent DVD for a literature class or a poetry club meeting.",1271289600,2,1354,4.864628820960698
8365105,4,B002DGS0P6,"Poet Timothy Victor Richardson has in this DVD taken poetry in general (and his own poetry from his volume of poems 'AFFLICTED LOVE') to a different level.  Not satisfied to spread his very committed beliefs about poetry (and all of art) being necessary to the civilization of mankind by stopping with the printed page, he here in this DVD produced and directed by Toni Seger elects to talk to the audience about his concept of poetry in a conversational manner.  The setting is one of Richardson simply sitting in a chair on a set, reading from a manuscript of notes about his philosophy, and then sharing his own poems by reading them while each of the unfolding poems is translated to phrases before our eyes.  Richardson makes the understanding of his particular penchant for sonnets and odes and the manner in which he deals with rhyming a classroom feeling discussion.  That part works very well.

Where the DVD falls a bit short is the rather monotone reading of the poetry by the man who wrote the words.  While it is a pleasure to see and hear the poet himself (archival significance being one reason to record this), Richardson's delivery hardly gives his poems the ability to take flight.  One is left wishing he had selected an actor to read the poems, leaving the discussion and the philosophy to Richardson.  For example, one of his better poems, 'Narcissus in the Mall' has the potential of being tragically beautiful, yet here it sounds somewhat like a monotone grocery list.

Other poets are now reading their poetry on the various sites available on the computer - sites with such gentle dignity as [...] - it is another, more easily available method of hearing poetry read aloud.  But  the act of creating this DVD is a sound idea.  This DVD can be transported to the classroom or the book club with ease and gives more insight into the art of writing poetry than many books of similar content.
