4154372,5,B003M70P12,"I've been a fan of Imogen Heap's music for just a few years now.  I love not only her musical creations but also that she has done the recording/engineering of her material as well.  That had me wishing to be a fly on the wall to see what it is she does to make these recordings.  With this DVD you get to be that fly on the wall, traveling with her to various worldly locations while she brings to life new songs, struggles with her own highly demanding inner-boss and polishes the tunes to the point where Ellipse was good enough to win a Grammy for best engineered CD.

You also get to see the progression of her former childhood home transformed into a really fine recording studio, testing her patience as of course these builds take a lot of time if the place is going to be properly crafted.

The audio recording geek in me wanted more time looking over her shoulder at her Pro Tools sessions to get more detailed information on her process, rather than just seeing a few zoomed in edits of various takes.  But on a balance this version is what most fans would want to see.

It was over too soon.  I was left wanting more time hanging out with her and her creative process.

The audio on some of the video clips from the road is hard to hear, but is like what you'd get if your friend Imogen sent you a video diary of her journey.

Having seen her live online and once here in Seattle I highly recommend taking in her show if you get the chance.  She maintains the fine balance between artist and audio gear geek.  I look forward to what she creates next and hope she finds a healthy balance between driven artist and kind-to-herself human being.",1288310400,3,1653,4.313915857605178
4154373,5,B003M70P12,"Everyone has heard a musical artist talk about how much work goes into making an album...but Imogen by far exceeds and is the definition of the word WORK.  Buy this video, become inspired and appreciate the work of a TRUE atrist who has made a name for serself and is kind enough to share the journey so very few fans ever get to see of someone they look up to.  If you've never heard Imogen's music, this is a perfict place to start and if you're a fan, a base to fall in love with her and the madness that is her musical creations all over again!

This is no American record company pop garbage creation.  So few artists are lucky enough to make music that is theirs and that they love.  Imogen creates on her terms, her timeline and redefines perfection.  She has compiled a loyal base of fans that continue to grow and is picking up more along the way.  This is by far the best documentary you'll sink your teeth into this year. Enjoy-",1288224000,3,939,4.271186440677966
4154374,5,B003M70P12,"I saw this film last night at its NYC premiere and was moved and inspired by how brilliantly it captured Imogen's creative process, as well as by the chance the film gave me to witness her creative process itself.

I have never seen what an artist goes through portrayed in anything other than a fictional re-creation.  This is the real thing!  All the triumphs (and there are many) and the pain as well (inevitable, but that doesn't stop her) are there... and her wonderful family members, friends, and collaborators as well.  Truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a genius at work... sometimes alone and sometimes surrounded by those who help her keep going!

I highly recommend this to all of Imogen's fans, as well as to people who want to observe the creative process of a brilliant artist for real.

My only wish is that there will be a ""special edition"" some day that shows us even more from the nearly 400 hours of footage that was recorded.  The film is perfect in length right now, but I can't help wondering what additional and inspiring scenes were captured during the three years Imogen spent working on ""Ellipse""!",1287619200,4,1135,4.730964467005077
4154375,5,B003M70P12,"This women is one of the most creative and talented artists to come along in over 40 years.. very underrated and must be heard and scene. Saw her in NYC in May and she was splendid.

Come on folks open your ears to orginality and creativity, stop listening to these damn rappers who can't write or sing their own melody's.. they have to sample.. in my day that was plagerism.

So here she is, either appreciate or be stuck in the mire which is popular music these days.

4154376,5,B003M70P12,"Well, no one is going to buy this DVD unless they love Imogen Heap, and everyone who loves her will love this documentary-of-sorts. It shows her creative process as she tirelessly works to create her third album Ellipse (which is excellent, by the way). She comes across as a lovely, lovely person with so much talent, passion, and innovative genius. This DVD gives you a glimpse into how she utilizes technology and social media to her advantage in making her music. I'm surprised her name is not a household word, but also feel somewhat smug and delighted that I, alone among my mom, Seattle friends, know of and love her so. I will continue to follow Immi and all of her creative endeavors.",1349395200,,693,4.642276422764228
4154377,5,B003M70P12,"An enjoyable behind the scenes look at Imogen's day to day life while in the process of moving into the old family homestead and building a studio there to make ""Ellipse"". She's Mozart reincarnate.",1344729600,,197,4.823529411764706
4154378,5,B003M70P12,"i looked into imogen heaps' music when i wanted to study production,

i have been hooked ever since!

 she writes like no one else in this day and age, she has versatility, technical expertise, an eye for perfection and detail, and breathtaking sounds.

this inspired me to work as hard as her for the career i want, and i will.
she is a lovely person who deserves to be selling millions more records than britney spears or anyone else like that.
 i am forever in awe of her musical talent.",1343606400,,490,4.4
4154379,4,B003M70P12,"Bought this last week. Makes  for wonderful addition to the double album and so makes for a very comprehensive and ambitious project altogether. An Album in the life of an artist.
  Wish there were more technical matters included ( more gear talk and techniques: plug ins, signal chain, mic,  instrument-software etc) but it was wonderful seeing a bit of the behind the scenes and learning more about this creative woman. She seems one part crazy art teacher, one part intense composer, one part cook, and two parts winsome pop star. There is a DIY feel to this that makes it feel genuine and less self-conscious than one might expect from a renowned star. It would have been nice to see more of the songs performed on piano  because in the few scenes where she does perform a few of the cuts acoustically, they seem so much richer when they aren't obscured by all the dense production.
Honestly I have to confess that I'm not really as keen on how the Album's song arrangements ended up as I'd like to have been. But this video stands up and bolsters the album. Infact, This video works despite how one might receive the songs because of  the  fascinating intimacy and uncommon access of the DVD. I some how wish this video had been the actual album product with the songs stretched out to full extent.
You are left with the sense that the album was done under a strict deadline and I wonder if it would have been better if it was allowed to develop and become ready whenever it was ready.
No matter, you can't leave this DVD without appreciating Imogen for the artist she is and as a dynamic spirit/woman/independent business person.
 I hope a DVD accompanies  all of her future works.",1341964800,,1687,4.578073089700997
4154380,5,B003M70P12,This film was a wonderful way to get a glimpse of the life and workings of one of the greatest musicians of our time.,1341964800,,117,3.9166666666666665
4154381,5,B003M70P12,"Imogen Heap is an incredible talent! The documentary shows us a glimpse of her way of thought and the struggles she faces throughout the process of making ""Ellipse"". If you are a new Heap fan, this is something you should not miss! I loved Ellipse when it first came out, but now I have a new found adoration (for the cd) and great admiration (for Heap) after watching this dvd.",1303171200,,378,4.414285714285715
4154382,5,B003M70P12,...and now we have the privilege to peer into this window that so few of us understand what goes on behind the scenes of the complete creation of a modern day musical masterpiece.,1298246400,,179,4.454545454545454
4154383,5,B003M70P12,"Wonderful documentary, one which showcases Heap's many talents, but more than anything, shows just how difficult it is to make an album such as ""Ellipse"".  One caveat right away - You must get the album first and become familiar with it, otherwise the DVD will make little sense.  That shouldn't be a problem, because Ellipse is one of the best and most original albums in recent memory - Every single song on it is brilliant.  (While you're at it, pick up the equally good ""Speak for Yourself"").

That's not to say that the DVD is perfect.  I, for one, was not all that interested in her house renovations or the building of the studio.  But once Heap started recording, I was riveted.  There are so many fascinating insights here, like her use of various noises from around the house, or how adding one crucial element totally changes the song.  (I'm thinking of the falling cello line she adds to the chorus of ""2-1"", and the soaring vocalise she adds to ""Wait It Out"".)  A few times we see the very moment that an inspiration hits Heap, and one feels very privileged to be a witness to it.

But, as I said, the overriding impression is the tremendous amount of work that Heap put into the making of Ellipse.  (For instance, it is revealed that Heap had around 30 versions of ""Tidal""!)  The end of the recording process is difficult to watch, as Heap, facing deadlines, pulls numerous ""all night-ers"", and starts to doubt her work.  As a musician myself, I know what it is like to spend hours in the studio and not feel like you've accomplished anything.  That fact that Heap was able to keep this up, month after month, is a tribute to her perserverance and positive attitude - The fact that the end product was the masterpiece we call Ellipse is miraculous.",1297555200,,1762,4.552380952380952
4154384,5,B003M70P12,"As someone who's worked in the music industry for a while, I was utterly blown away by the creativity and originality displayed here.  Imogen has always been an artist I admire, but I will listen to her albums with a whole new perspective now.  Truly inspiring.  Her Grammy was the icing on the cake for Ellipse.",1296518400,2,312,4.535714285714286
4154385,5,B003M70P12,"The musicians and artists I really respect are the ones who are creators. They write their own songs. They play one or more instruments, and they perform at a high level. An added bonus is if you find them to be a good honest person who is transparent and seems interested in their fans. Imogen Heap is all of the above. She is brilliant, talented, driven, creative, innovative and not afraid to try new things. This woman lives and breathes to be a musician. Watch this DVD and see what a real genuine artist goes through to create something worth listening to. Beautifully done. A wonderful job of capturing the life of Imogen as she went on the Ellipse journey. I can't see how anyone could watch this and not appreciate how wonderful and precious a gift we have in Imogen Heap. I would love to be able to spend some time with this incredible musician. Imogen, we love you !!!!",1293926400,2,880,4.472049689440993

4154387,5,B003M70P12,"For Imogen fans, it doesn't get any better than this!  Her creative process is so much fun to watch, and you get to see where and how she lives.  Good stuff!",1292371200,2,157,4.032258064516129
4154388,5,B003M70P12,".. thats all. Just brilliant. Every generation gets a couple of people that are so good they raise the bar noticeably and dramatically. Imogen Heap is one of these people. ""Ellipse"" is one of the greatest albums of all time. It is note for note perfection. This vid gives you a great look into the heart, mind and soul of a true musical genius. If you're tight on cash buy the album, but if you are interested at all in Ms. Heap you must get this.",1291766400,3,447,4.209302325581396
4154389,5,B003M70P12,"I'd say that this video documentary really shows just how talented Imgoen Heap is. There are lots of transitional scenes showing her playing piano and you can see that she really knows and breathes music.

I bought this video because as a beginning musician I thought it might help me learn how to create, as I've been really stuck in the art of composition. I appreciated seeing Imogen getting a bit nutty and really stretching herself thin to write and finish her recordings. It's nice to know that making music isn't some easy task that I don't get, which is what I've kind of believed up to this point. It seems to require a very serious commitment, lots of time, and a lot of doubt along the way - even for someone with incredible talent.

The video is also very entertaining as Heap is quite funny and quirky and has a strong positive demeanor.",1291507200,3,850,4.512987012987013
4154390,5,B003M70P12,"Imogen's first ever full length dvd is just simply amazing! The story of Ellipse is one that will fill you with excitement from beginning to end. This dvd allows us to get a first hand expeirence of what life for Imogen is like on a day to day basis during the course of her moving into her old family house and making it her own, building her studio and creating her masterpiece Ellipse. We get to follow her around from the very beginning of her worldly travels while writing songs along the way to her playing the finished product live on stage for all to hear in her 2009/10 world tour.
I really enjoy watching this dvd over and over, being able to watch Imogen work is simply amazing and inspiring. There are some fun extras on the dvd as well. I simply can not say enough good things about this dvd and Imogen herself.
Although I do hope that one day we might get an expanded dvd with more footage on it. With almost 400 hurs of footage shot 90 minutes is simply not enough. I could watch ever single moment of that footage and be completely entranced by Imogen. This is a must have for any Imogen Heap fan and something I would recomend to any musician or anyone who apreceiates the processes and work that goes into creating amazing sounds and music.",1290729600,3,1258,4.357446808510638
4154391,5,B003M70P12,Everything In-Between is such an amazing insight into the musical world of Imogen Heap.  I love the album Ellipse and this DVD is a must have!  It is wonderful to actually see the magic that happens both in and out of the studio!!,1290556800,3,230,4.325581395348837

4154393,5,B003M70P12,This is by far the most inspirational documentary I've ever seen. Imogen allows us to walk with her through her journey of Ellipse. She's not afraid to show the ups and downs of the music industry. This film allows us to see Imogen's passion and love for her music and fans. Thank you for inviting on this journey.,1288569600,3,314,4.431034482758621
4154394,5,B003M70P12,"This DVD cemented my devotion and appreciation for Imogen Heap as an artist and as a person. She is simply an artistic genius! How can such a lovely, talented musician be so under credited and unknown? I feel like someone this creative and inspiring should be known by name by everyone who loves music! I am dumbfounded by how clever and ambitious Imogen is. No one else in the industry does what she can do with music and technology- she is a legend. She is such an inspiration and the world is truly blessed to have her.

Anyone who is an Imogen Heap fan should own this movie. Anyone who is unfamiliar with her should also own this movie. It is SO worth it. I am still in awe from what I saw. I have been privileged enough to meet Imogen Heap twice and she is just as charming and gracious as she was in the film. Her process is unique and what I watched only made me love her more.

Please come back to the US to tour Imogen! Watching you play live are some of the best moments of my life. You impress me beyond words.

Love your biggest fan,

4154395,5,B003M70P12,"Immi, this was worth the wait (since June).  We received the dvd today. It is now past 11 and B and I have just finished your dvd and we are truly speechless.  You are an inspiration.  While we have seen you perform live already twice in Dallas in Nov. '09 and Jan '10, we loved learning more about you.  As Justine said, we both now feel as though you're a dear friend.  We are grateful you have shared your life, your process, and your latest product; that is, this milestone album, Ellipse.

This album is so deep and the dvd helps to understand the effort put into the work.  It truly is part of you that you have shared.  You breathe into every song, every note, every sound.  What an amazing artist!  Any viewer will grasp the agony you must have gone through to create this masterpiece.  After now seeing the ""making of,"" I will appreciate every note that much more... and I still have trouble identifying which of the songs is my favorite.  This is because each is part of a story, that is Immi's story; of her life, her music, her career at this specific time.  She has so much to offer and she is so young.  Now we all cannot wait 'til the next chapter.

p.s. love the car, immi!  ...one question, does ""ellipse"" come from the shape of your home?",1288310400,6,1256,4.303418803418803

8400146,5,B003M70P12,"I watched this movie in December 2010. I could not believe it! Imogen Heap really knows her stuff when it comes to music production! Mainstream artists tend to have producers that do all the looping and mixing. Imogen Heap does it all herself, and it is better than any of that mainstream pop! And now, not only do we get to hear Imogen, we get to look behind the scenes; her studio, her performance, her love of music. Any fan of Imogen Heap (or any fan of music documentaries, for that matter) should buy this DVD. It is best if you've listened to the Ellipse CD before, though it is not required. Imogen Heap is definitely the most innovative artist, and this film pretty much covers it!",1372204800,,690,4.440944881889764
