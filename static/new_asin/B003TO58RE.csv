8405326,5,B003TO58RE,"Marvelous concert where Cliff Richard gave his all, like he usually does in concert. He had the energy here of a man half his age, but didn't slow down anywhere!  Great songs, great talent, and quality recording.",1417651200,,212,4.72972972972973
8405327,5,B003TO58RE,"I've been a big fan of Cliff Richard since 1963, and I like pretty much everything that he releases. So my review, or course, is biased.

The style of this is Big Band, and, with few exceptions, is unlike his favorite pop-rock style for which he is best known.  I really like this DVD, as Cliff handles this music, also, in an excellent manner.  His voice always has great timber, and excellent diction and expression.  What is there not to like?

A WORD OF CAUTION FOR AMERICAN PURCHASERS:
  Unfortunately, the DVD is in PAL format, and therefore will NOT play on most American players.  Therefore, buy with caution.",1402876800,,617,4.648148148148148
