When her husband passes away after a car accident, Shin-Ae (Jeon Do-Yeon) and her son, Jun relocate down South to her husband's hometown of Miryang. She attempts to settle down by opening a small piano school and yet she finds that she can't fit in this unfamiliar but ""very normal"" place. Life goes on as she gains piano students with the aid of a car repair shop owner, Kim Jong-Chan (Song Kang-Ho, Sympathy of Mr. Vengeance) despite the fact that she finds his attentions to be nuisance. Her son, Jun seems to be adapting quite well to their new life but fate intervenes; their lives are turned upside-down when her son becomes a victim of a fatal kidnapping. (this is not a spoiler, all this happens in the first act/first few minutes of the film)
Shin-Ae turns to Christianity to relieve her pain and anger, but when something occurs that makes her question her faith, she begins to rebel against God.

Christianity has made quite an impact in South Korea the past several years. ""Secret Sunshine"" boldly goes to the lengths of portraying just what Christianity is from one woman's point of view. To many, Christianity is a way of tradition, to others it is a social affair, some have religion because they see themselves as a blessed few; but for this woman named Shin-Ae (played by Jeon Do-Yeon) it is the only thing she has left in her life. Shin-Ae's religious faith is the film's central focus and the film's most powerful theme. When things don't turn out the way you wanted it to, does one turn away from God? Lee Chang-Dong presents powerful this moral character study of a woman awakened by her faith that becomes blind obsession, that turns into a frightening rebellion. Life is complex and the belief in God is no different. The film doesn't hold back in what it is trying to say, it criticizes religion itself in a very blistering manner.

The film's structure is very odd; it starts off as a romantic drama, then it becomes a thriller until it goes into overdrive as the female lead descends into her own personal darkness. However, odd it may be, it remains riveting. Its unpredictability is played quite well as it reflects just how unpredictable changes can become in one's life. I can reveal two subtle metaphors in the film's first act and near its climax that Lee Chang-Dong may have wanted to reveal without spoiling the film. It occurs in the film's first act when Shin-Ae was walking around in town soliciting for piano lessons. A small badly-lit boutique owned by a moody owner has a very small clientele. The interior of the store is painted black and before Shin-Ae walks out she advises the owner to paint the place with bright colors. Near the film's climax, the same store appears re-painted and re-decorated in white. I think these two sequences reflect the potential brightness and darkness in one's life; it would be up to the individual as to how one chooses to live his own life. Lee Chang-Dong makes a powerful statement.

Of course the film's success would have to depend on a very powerful actress and Jeon Do-Yeon does a stellar job as its lead. The actress proves the character's equal in its raw layers of depth. Jeon Do-yeon once again impresses me as she has done in the true-to-life drama, ""You are my Sunshine"" as a woman stricken with Aids. Her ability to express her character's descent into madness is full of powerful emotion and is so convincing that I felt genuine sympathy for Shin-Ae but at the same I was disturbed by the sequences I was privy to. Song Kang-Ho is a terrific actor and plays the man infatuated by Shin-Ae and would do pretty much almost anything for her. His character represents the goodness in her life that he would try to overcome any obstacle. Of course, the man doesn't lose his credibility as a human being--I was very surprised when he lost his cool in a fit of fury.

""SECRET SUNSHINE"" is the type of film that would stay with you even after the end of its end credits. The film has the inert ability to get under one's skin with its powerful theme and motifs that more than likely will cause some to question just what exactly is religion's meaning to them. These controversial questions are brought to bear with strong precision. To many, religion is a way of life, while to others it is a vehicle for comfort and a way to feel ""blessed""--for me, the film doesn't question God's existence, (although Shin-Ae does bring this up) it just BOLDLY criticizes religion itself. Lee Chang-Dong expresses in a very blistering and riveting manner that one should NOT mistake that a strong belief in Religious practices is the same as a strong, immovable Faith in God.

3025029,5,B000YATOOE,"I recently saw this movie while working in Jinju, S.Korea, about 30 minutes from where this takes place.  This movie is an accurate portrait of life in a mid-sized Korean city.  It is ambiguous in the best sense of the word: critical of religion while not condemning.  A portrait of exactly how one copes with the most horrible tragedy.  The lead actress won a Cannes award for her performance and she deserves it.  She is in turns funny, sad and pious, all shown in a perfectly measured, never exaggerated performance.  This movie is unique and recommended without the slightest reservation.",1199232000,7,592,4.87
3025030,5,B000YATOOE,"This is truly extraordinary and wonderful film, profound and profoundly depressing, and a perfect antidote to the delusions and falsehood of Hollywood. It exemplifies what makes contemporary Korean cinema so compelling: a willingness to explore human suffering without the promise of redemption --- political, spiritual, or aesthetic. The last shot of the film says it all. And the lead actresses performance was amazing: she seemed so fully consumed by her role that she became a new person as her character changed.",1198454400,19,517,5.395061728395062

The Korean movie ""Secret Sunshine"" (Korean Title: Merlyoung) which is the name of a small town in the southern section of Korea.  The movie is well acted by Jaun Do Un, her performance is truly outstanding.  It is a movie of tragedy with the untimely death of her husband and the kidnapping and murder of her son.  It is a movie that is hard to beat with the wonderful acting by Ms. Jaun Do Un.",1197763200,4,449,4.126436781609195
3025122,1,B000YATOOE,The DVD  disc of this movie  was unplayble.  Completely deteriorated.  Luckily I had the earlier Korean version which played just fine. Shame on you Criterion.,1364774400,,159,5.24
3025123,4,B000YATOOE,"Secret Sunshine follows Shin-Ae (Jeon Do-yeon) as she moves into the small town of Milyang, South Korea, with her child to start a new life; her new journey starts off well, but is eventually devastated by the abduction of her child. Can she find the secret sunshine to brighten her dark life?

I enjoyed the story in this film. I believe it accurately catches the emotions one goes through when her life is hit with devastation after devastation; Jeon Do-yeon and Song Kang-ho had amazing performances.  Some moments are heartwarming, while others are heartbreaking. A major aspect of the film is religion and how it can comfort someone during hard times. Does it preach? I don't think so; in fact, I believe it throws a twists into the ""religion saves the day"" type of movies without being distasteful. I also enjoyed the ending, and loved the sense of ambiguity within it; definitely thought-provoking. The acting was great from the entire cast, and the music was amazing. However, the film had a slow pace, and also had some unexplained or poorly explained aspects; on a personal note, I would've loved to see or hear more about the tragedy as it was important to the story and believe would've engaged the audience a bit more. It's a dark and realistic film, so it can affect you on an emotional level.

Overall, Secret Sunshine is an amazing drama complimented by its superb performances, and holds a significant message. I recommend a purchase or rental, and highly recommend a purchase for fans of South Korean cinema.

3025124,4,B000YATOOE,This film was difficult to watch and suitable for mature audiences. It deals honestly with human pain and issues of Christian faith. Really thought provoking.,1344556800,2,158,5.36
3025125,4,B000YATOOE,"I agree with the judges at Cannes for awarding Jeon Do-yeon the best actress award.  She delivers a terrific and believable performance.  She is quite adept at portraying her character's fragile emotional state.  This is one of the best female performances I have seen in recent films.  I liken her performance to many of the classic and understated Japanese actresses of the 50s and 60s such as Setsuko Hara (huge praise coming from me).

I wanted to give it five stars because of the riveting performances in this film (including a wonderful performance by Kang-ho Song... you know him as Mr. Vengeance most likely).  All in all the acting is a delight.  The supporting casts' performances are as entertaining as they are baffling and cynical.

The actual film is a mixed bag though.  Mainly because of the middle, where the film really drags a bit.  It seems that with a little extra editing and a few cuts, the director could have kept the pace.  But it takes a sudden and obvious lull, one that I think it out of character with the rest of the film.  Without giving away anything major, this is the point where she is involved with the religious group.  There is a bit of a spark during the prison scenes, then more lull.  It picks up again around the time she plays the CD at the prayer meeting.

If the film had spent a little less time on the religious aspect in the middle, I might have given it five stars.  But it's a collection of scenes that I think were too long to get the point across and slowed the plot progression too much.

Extras were sparse on the DVD release (not sure about the Blu-Ray).  The booklet was nice with an essay, but was just a few pages.  Nothing like some of the more notable Criterion releases.  And being a new film, there probably wasn't need for any restoration.  It's a Criterion distributed film though, and they tend to distribute only high quality newer (and usually independent or foreign) films (Like Fear and Loathing, Still Walking, and Royal Tenenbaums).  This is a worthy addition to their list.

I watch a lot of old Japanese film, including films by Ozu, but have no problem with the pace (it's slow the entire time!).  But something about the film just didn't feel right, and that is why four stars overall.  But 5 solid stars for the acting.  I checked this out from my local library, so luckily I didn't have to purchase it.  I would recommend it for renting, streaming (if offered from a streaming site), or checking out at the library before purchasing.",1328572800,2,2512,4.56152125279642
3025126,4,B000YATOOE,"Powerful, thought-provoking and fantastic film by director Lee Chang-dong (""Oasis"", ""Poetry"", ""Peppermint Candy"").

""Secret Sunshine"" (Milyang), the award-winning 2007 South Korean film features a superb and heartbreaking performance by actress Jeon Do-yeon (""Best Actress"" at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival) and also a wonderful performance by Kang-ho Song (""Shiri"", ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"", ""J.S.A"").

And with a collaboration with IFC Films,  finally, ""Secret Sunshine"" receives its HD release in the US courtesy of the Criterion Collection.

VIDEO:

""Secret Sunshine"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 Aspect Ratio).  ""Secret Sunshine"" looks absolutely pristine and vibrant.  Colors are vibrant, black levels are nice and deep, skin tones are natural and there are no blemishes, no artifacting, no edge enhancement.  I was very impressed by how colorful and vibrant this film was and how awesome it looked on Blu-ray.

According to the Criterion Collection, the transfer was supervised and approved by director Lee Chang-dong and cinematographer Cho Yong-kyu and was created from the original negative, which was scanned on a Northlight scanner in 2K resolution.  A Baselight4 was used to create a digital intermediate.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Secret Sunshine"" is presented in Korean DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround audio.  For a dramatic film such as ""Secret Sunshine"", you expect a dialogue-driven lossless soundtrack.  Dialogue is crystal clear and I didn't hear too much ambiance but for the most part, it's a dialogue driven soundtrack.  And perfect for this type of film.

According to the Criterion Collection was mastered at 24-bit from the original digital audio master files using Pro Tools HD.

Subtitles are in English (and are optional).

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Secret Sunshine - The Criterion Collection #576' on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:

EXTRAS:

""Secret Sunshine - The Criterion Collection #576' comes with a 20-page booklet which comes with the following essay ""A Cinema of Lucidity"" by Dennis Lim.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Secret Sunshine"" was a film that surprised many audiences.

Not only did the film have a fantastic, emotional and heartbreaking performance by actress Jeon Do-yeon but it takes viewers on a path of showcasing a woman's pain and suffering and how Christianity comes to play in her life, good and bad.

And it is quite the juxtaposition of last month's release of ""Lon Morin, Priest"" which featured a woman trying to get close to a priest and take part of an forbidden love while being taught about religion, in the case of ""Secret Sunshine"", where the film is not a religious film, it does take on religious topics.

I'm sure many of us know, read or have seen people who have came from the darkest place in their lives to find God and change for the better.  But in the case of Shin-ae, can religion and God being in her life help her through tragedy?  What about the pain and sorrow in a person's heart, can one easily forgive a person for the pain inflicted on them?

This is the goal of director Lee Chang-dong, his curiousity of the individual who has to go through that emotional rollercoaster and to see if one can successfully eliminate their pain by accepting God in their life.

While this film is very hard for me to describe what happened without spoiling the film, I will say that filmmaker Lee Chang-dong did a wonderful job in the planning of this film but also finding the right talent.  Actress Jeon Do-yeon is superb in this film.  She is able to showcase all sorts of emotions that will touch you but also make you feel her pain.  It's a pain that a viewer can be sympathetic to but it's how its demonstrated on screen, you can't help but feel her pain because of the efficacy of her acting.

Also, we have actor Kang-ho Song, very well known for plenty of Korean blockbuster hits, typically action/suspense type of roles but Song is important in providing that balance in making the film watchable and not entirely depressing.  Song's character of Jong Chan is  the symbol of the guardian angel who tries to help Shin-ae but for some reason, she rejects him.  For Jong, he obviously loves Shin-ae but he's not very good with women, but he feels comfort in being with her, helping her through this tough time, even though he is constantly rejected.

While ""Secret Sunshine"" may not affect those familiar with Korean entertainment and are used to seeing Korean films (especially Korean drama) and seeing how a happy and fun film can immediately turn tragic, ""Secret Sunshine"" succeeds and also separates itself from other forms of Korean storylines in the fact that it showcases a person's emotional path of dealing with their pain.

Where in Asian cinema, we are typically taken through the banality of tragedy hits person, person manages to find love and then you receive closure.  This is not what Lee Chang-dong was wanting for his film, he wanted to showcase the person and how they deal with their pain, in a realistic manner.

Whenever there is tragedy, we will always have friends and family who will say, ""we are praying for you"" and we have people who will try to introduce you to religion or have you going to church in order to heal your heart.  And we see the protagonist going through that, until she is blindsided by irony and now, she questions God and once again, she spirals out of control.

""Secret Sunshine"" is a fantastic film featuring a wonderful performance by its talent.  While the Blu-ray release doesn't have plenty of special features, at least Criterion Collection was able to include an interview with the director as well as a behind-the-scene featurette with interviews with the director and both Jeon Do-yeon and Song Kang-ho.

The picture quality of this film is absolutely vibrant and beautiful and the cinematic shots, there are some memorable scenes that will stay in your mind forever.  The scene with Shin-ae when she enters the church for the first time to release all the pain that has kept inside her, what a fantastic and heartbreaking scene and definitely a well-deserved award for Jeon Do-yeon.

Overall, ""Secret Sunshine"" is another fantastic release from the Criterion Collection but possibly one of the their most depressing films to be released yet. But it also makes me happy to see a South Korean film being released by the Criterion Collection and I hope more Korean films are planned for future releases from Criterion.

""Secret Sunshine"" is a powerful, though-provoking film worth owning on Blu-ray!

Highly recommended!",1323993600,4,7021,5.04163052905464
3025127,2,B000YATOOE,"The entire script has a fabricated make believe, unreal feel to it. Starting with a stereotypic scenario of a female piano teacher (Shin-ae) with a misbehaving child and recently deceased husband, suddenly having her car breakdown and is rescued by a mechanic who later becomes her stalker. Thus begins her process of moving to a small town to start life over again. Only to encounter almost cartoonish characters in the townspeople who spend their lives gossiping; women practically living in beauty salons and gorging on snacks while gossiping; males smoking and checking out the genitals of females; and everyone embracing the evangelism of Christianity through cleansing control of everyone else's lives. Shin-ae loses her son to a kidnapping/murder by the local teacher who suddenly after 40 years decides to be a murderer - sure! As a result Shin-ae vacillates between theft, vandalism, sex, God and no-God in a too cartoonish fabricated manner. Bizarre that the stalking, most self-serving individual may have turned out to be kindest person. Not clear.

It may have been the director's intent to showcase an entire town in such a fashion - as if there was a dark undercurrent to their fallacious facade. A common theme, but there are better ways to show in a clear and poignant manner the roles and interplay of belief, skepticism, love, loss, self-greed, materialism and evangelism without resorting to such cookie cutter figurines as portrayed here.",1322352000,6,1459,5.182203389830509

Overall, the acting is quite good, and many of the characters are appealing. But to some viewers, this movie is apt to be seen as heavy-handed and overly didactic; treading very close to the borders of proselytization.",1317859200,3,544,5.264367816091954
3025130,5,B000YATOOE,"Many things have been said about Jeon Do-Yeon's performance in `Secret Sunshine'.  In fact, many have hailed it as one of the finest turns in the past decade.  Sadly, many still haven't seen it, but now that it has an official US release and is finally on DVD maybe many more will get their chance.

Please take that chance.

I may be rash in saying this, but it needs saying; what Jeon Do-Yeon does in this film is beyond remarkable.  In fact, it may be the best performance by any actor or actress to splash across the big screen in the past ten years or so.  Seriously, maybe twenty.  I don't say this with ignorance either, considering that I watch a lot of films and have seen nearly every `raved' performance to come out of the last few decades.  There is a complexity, a subtle layering that is so often overlooked when actors and or actresses attempt a character like Shin-ae.  Here you have a tired and worn woman.  She is soulless, but not in the typical sense of the word.  Her husband, her lying, cheating husband is dead and now, after she has made steps to move on and sever her old life from her very skin, she has a major setback when her young son is ripped from her life.  Shin-ae lacks a soul because everything that made her alive inside is gone.  Whenever this type of character presents itself, it is usually portrayed with layer upon layer of theatrical grief.  That isn't the case here.  A lot of times when this character is created there is a one-note vibe that seeps from its pores.  That isn't the case here either.  Instead, Shin-ae becomes a living breathing dead woman.  She has her outbursts, but they all feel connected to a place of earnestness.  When she screams and wales and beats her chest while attending church; you feel it as if it were happening in your own living room.  But there is more.  When she tries to sell herself for mindless pleasure, you cry for her because you understand the depth of her pain.  When she cracks in the face of her own tragedy, you heart falls into your stomach.

Yes, Jeon Do-Yeon does so much with her face.

That phone call.

That prison meeting.

The only negative I can muster is that, outside Jeon's performance MAKES this film.  I honestly don't think it can hold up without her impressive shoulders there to steady it.  It's not that the film is bad at all, and it covers such intensely controversial ground, but walking away from this film I think of nothing more than Jeon's marvelous performance.  I have nothing else to say.  The movie is very good, but Jeon is so good that she overshadows the rest of everything.

Shin-Ae turns to Christianity to relieve her pain and anger, but when something occurs that makes her question her faith, she begins to rebel against God.

Christianity has made quite an impact in South Korea the past several years. ""Secret Sunshine"" boldly goes to the lengths of portraying just what Christianity is from one woman's point of view. To many, Christianity is a way of tradition, to others it is a social affair, some have religion because they see themselves as a blessed few; but for this woman named Shin-Ae (played by Jeon Do-Yeon) it is the only thing she has left in her life. Shin-Ae's religious faith is the film's central focus and the film's most powerful theme. When things don't turn out the way you wanted it to, does one turn away from God? Lee Chang-Dong presents powerful this moral character study of a woman awakened by her faith that becomes blind obsession, that turns into a frightening rebellion. Life is complex and the belief in God is no different. The film doesn't hold back in what it is trying to say, it criticizes religion itself in a very blistering manner.

The film's structure is very odd; it starts off as a romantic drama, then it becomes a thriller until it goes into overdrive as the female lead descends into her own personal darkness. However, odd it may be, it remains riveting. Its unpredictability is played quite well as it reflects just how unpredictable changes can become in one's life. I can reveal two subtle metaphors in the film's first act and near its climax that Lee Chang-Dong may have wanted to reveal without spoiling the film. It occurs in the film's first act when Shin-Ae was walking around in town soliciting for piano lessons. A small badly-lit boutique owned by a moody owner has a very small clientele. The interior of the store is painted black and before Shin-Ae walks out she advises the owner to paint the place with bright colors. Near the film's climax, the same store appears re-painted and re-decorated in white. I think these two sequences reflect the potential brightness and darkness in one's life; it would be up to the individual as to how one chooses to live his own life. Lee Chang-Dong makes a powerful statement.

Of course the film's success would have to depend on a very powerful actress and Jeon Do-Yeon does a stellar job as its lead. The actress proves the character's equal in its raw layers of depth. Jeon Do-yeon once again impresses me as she has done in the true-to-life drama, ""You are my Sunshine"" as a woman stricken with Aids. Her ability to express her character's descent into madness is full of powerful emotion and is so convincing that I felt genuine sympathy for Shin-Ae but at the same I was disturbed by the sequences I was privy to. Song Kang-Ho is a terrific actor and plays the man infatuated by Shin-Ae and would do pretty much almost anything for her. His character represents the goodness in her life that he would try to overcome any obstacle. Of course, the man doesn't lose his credibility as a human being--I was very surprised when he lost his cool in a fit of fury.

""SECRET SUNSHINE"" is the type of film that would stay with you even after the end of its end credits. The film has the inert ability to get under one's skin with its powerful theme and motifs that more than likely will cause some to question just what exactly is religion's meaning to them. These controversial questions are brought to bear with strong precision. To many, religion is a way of life, while to others it is a vehicle for comfort and a way to feel ""blessed""--for me, the film doesn't question God's existence, (although Shin-Ae does bring this up) it just BOLDLY criticizes religion itself. Lee Chang-Dong expresses in a very blistering and riveting manner that one should NOT mistake that a strong belief in Religious practices is the same as a strong, immovable Faith in God.

3259525,5,B000YATOOE,"Lee Chang-Dong is a film professor turned director who is responsible for such acclaimed hits such as the fantastic ""Peppermint Candy"", the touching ""Oasis""  and ""Green Fish"". He has also been appointed as Korea's minister of culture and tourism at one point but has abandoned this post to concentrate on his filmmaking. This director has, on several occasions has managed to silence my voice because of the powerful portrayal of life in his films; it just strikes a chord in me and gets under my skin. ""SECRET SUNSHINE"" is no different, the film has won numerous awards and was given high praise in Cannes (Jeon Do-Yeon won best actress). It also enjoyed a phenomenal audience reaction in its limited run in America. The film is controversial; and it presents a very bleak view of Religion, Faith and (maybe?) brings up questions about the existence of God.

When her husband passes away after a car accident, Shin-Ae (Jeon Do-Yeon) and her son, Jun relocate down South to her husband's hometown of Miryang. She attempts to settle down by opening a small piano school and yet she finds that she can't fit in this unfamiliar but ""very normal"" place. Life goes on as she gains piano students with the aid of a car repair shop owner, Kim Jong-Chan (Song Kang-Ho, Sympathy of Mr. Vengeance) despite the fact that she finds his attentions to be nuisance. Her son, Jun seems to be adapting quite well to their new life but fate intervenes; their lives are turned upside-down when her son becomes a victim of a fatal kidnapping.
Shin-Ae turns to Christianity to relieve her pain and anger, but when something occurs that makes her question her faith, she begins to rebel against God.

Christianity has made quite an impact in South Korea the past several years. ""Secret Sunshine"" boldly goes to the lengths of portraying just what Christianity is from one woman's point of view.

It is ambiguous in the best sense of the word: critical of religion while not condemning.  A portrait of exactly how one copes with the most horrible tragedy.

I enjoyed the story in this film. I believe it accurately catches the emotions one goes through when her life is hit with devastation after devastation; Jeon Do-yeon and Song Kang-ho had amazing performances.  Some moments are heartwarming, while others are heartbreaking. A major aspect of the film is religion and how it can comfort someone during hard times. Does it preach? I don't think so; in fact, I believe it throws a twists into the ""religion saves the day"" type of movies without being distasteful. I also enjoyed the ending, and loved the sense of ambiguity within it; definitely thought-provoking. The acting was great from the entire cast, and the music was amazing. However, the film had a slow pace, and also had some unexplained or poorly explained aspects; on a personal note, I would've loved to see or hear more about the tragedy as it was important to the story and believe would've engaged the audience a bit more. It's a dark and realistic film, so it can affect you on an emotional level.

Overall, Secret Sunshine is an amazing drama complimented by its superb performances, and holds a significant message. I recommend a purchase or rental, and highly recommend a purchase for fans of South Korean cinema.

3259622,4,B000YATOOE,"I agree with the judges at Cannes for awarding Jeon Do-yeon the best actress award.  She delivers a terrific and believable performance.  She is quite adept at portraying her character's fragile emotional state.  This is one of the best female performances I have seen in recent films.  I liken her performance to many of the classic and understated Japanese actresses of the 50s and 60s such as Setsuko Hara (huge praise coming from me).

I wanted to give it five stars because of the riveting performances in this film (including a wonderful performance by Kang-ho Song... you know him as Mr. Vengeance most likely).  All in all the acting is a delight.  The supporting casts' performances are as entertaining as they are baffling and cynical.

The actual film is a mixed bag though.  Mainly because of the middle, where the film really drags a bit.  It seems that with a little extra editing and a few cuts, the director could have kept the pace.  But it takes a sudden and obvious lull, one that I think it out of character with the rest of the film.  Without giving away anything major, this is the point where she is involved with the religious group.  There is a bit of a spark during the prison scenes, then more lull.  It picks up again around the time she plays the CD at the prayer meeting.

If the film had spent a little less time on the religious aspect in the middle, I might have given it five stars.  But it's a collection of scenes that I think were too long to get the point across and slowed the plot progression too much.

Extras were sparse on the DVD release (not sure about the Blu-Ray).  The booklet was nice with an essay, but was just a few pages.  Nothing like some of the more notable Criterion releases.  And being a new film, there probably wasn't need for any restoration.  It's a Criterion distributed film though, and they tend to distribute only high quality newer (and usually independent or foreign) films (Like Fear and Loathing, Still Walking, and Royal Tenenbaums).  This is a worthy addition to their list.

I watch a lot of old Japanese film, including films by Ozu, but have no problem with the pace (it's slow the entire time!).  But something about the film just didn't feel right, and that is why four stars overall.  But 5 solid stars for the acting.  I checked this out from my local library, so luckily I didn't have to purchase it.

And with a collaboration with IFC Films,  finally, ""Secret Sunshine"" receives its HD release in the US courtesy of the Criterion Collection.

VIDEO:

""Secret Sunshine"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 Aspect Ratio).  ""Secret Sunshine"" looks absolutely pristine and vibrant.  Colors are vibrant, black levels are nice and deep, skin tones are natural and there are no blemishes, no artifacting, no edge enhancement.  I was very impressed by how colorful and vibrant this film was and how awesome it looked on Blu-ray.

According to the Criterion Collection, the transfer was supervised and approved by director Lee Chang-dong and cinematographer Cho Yong-kyu and was created from the original negative, which was scanned on a Northlight scanner in 2K resolution.  A Baselight4 was used to create a digital intermediate.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Secret Sunshine"" is presented in Korean DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround audio.  For a dramatic film such as ""Secret Sunshine"", you expect a dialogue-driven lossless soundtrack.  Dialogue is crystal clear and I didn't hear too much ambiance but for the most part, it's a dialogue driven soundtrack.  And perfect for this type of film.

""Secret Sunshine - The Criterion Collection #576' comes with a 20-page booklet which comes with the following essay ""A Cinema of Lucidity"" by Dennis Lim.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Secret Sunshine"" was a film that surprised many audiences.

Not only did the film have a fantastic, emotional and heartbreaking performance by actress Jeon Do-yeon but it takes viewers on a path of showcasing a woman's pain and suffering and how Christianity comes to play in her life, good and bad.

And it is quite the juxtaposition of last month's release of ""Lon Morin, Priest"" which featured a woman trying to get close to a priest and take part of an forbidden love while being taught about religion, in the case of ""Secret Sunshine"", where the film is not a religious film, it does take on religious topics.

I'm sure many of us know, read or have seen people who have came from the darkest place in their lives to find God and change for the better.  But in the case of Shin-ae, can religion and God being in her life help her through tragedy?  What about the pain and sorrow in a person's heart, can one easily forgive a person for the pain inflicted on them?

This is the goal of director Lee Chang-dong, his curiousity of the individual who has to go through that emotional rollercoaster and to see if one can successfully eliminate their pain by accepting God in their life.

While this film is very hard for me to describe what happened without spoiling the film, I will say that filmmaker Lee Chang-dong did a wonderful job in the planning of this film but also finding the right talent.  Actress Jeon Do-yeon is superb in this film.  She is able to showcase all sorts of emotions that will touch you but also make you feel her pain.  It's a pain that a viewer can be sympathetic to but it's how its demonstrated on screen, you can't help but feel her pain because of the efficacy of her acting.

Also, we have actor Kang-ho Song, very well known for plenty of Korean blockbuster hits, typically action/suspense type of roles but Song is important in providing that balance in making the film watchable and not entirely depressing.  Song's character of Jong Chan is  the symbol of the guardian angel who tries to help Shin-ae but for some reason, she rejects him.  For Jong, he obviously loves Shin-ae but he's not very good with women, but he feels comfort in being with her, helping her through this tough time, even though he is constantly rejected.

While ""Secret Sunshine"" may not affect those familiar with Korean entertainment and are used to seeing Korean films (especially Korean drama) and seeing how a happy and fun film can immediately turn tragic, ""Secret Sunshine"" succeeds and also separates itself from other forms of Korean storylines in the fact that it showcases a person's emotional path of dealing with their pain.

Where in Asian cinema, we are typically taken through the banality of tragedy hits person, person manages to find love and then you receive closure.  This is not what Lee Chang-dong was wanting for his film, he wanted to showcase the person and how they deal with their pain, in a realistic manner.

Whenever there is tragedy, we will always have friends and family who will say, ""we are praying for you"" and we have people who will try to introduce you to religion or have you going to church in order to heal your heart.  And we see the protagonist going through that, until she is blindsided by irony and now, she questions God and once again, she spirals out of control.

""Secret Sunshine"" is a fantastic film featuring a wonderful performance by its talent.  While the Blu-ray release doesn't have plenty of special features, at least Criterion Collection was able to include an interview with the director as well as a behind-the-scene featurette with interviews with the director and both Jeon Do-yeon and Song Kang-ho.

The picture quality of this film is absolutely vibrant and beautiful and the cinematic shots, there are some memorable scenes that will stay in your mind forever.  The scene with Shin-ae when she enters the church for the first time to release all the pain that has kept inside her, what a fantastic and heartbreaking scene and definitely a well-deserved award for Jeon Do-yeon.

Overall, ""Secret Sunshine"" is another fantastic release from the Criterion Collection but possibly one of the their most depressing films to be released yet. But it also makes me happy to see a South Korean film being released by the Criterion Collection and I hope more Korean films are planned for future releases from Criterion.

""Secret Sunshine"" is a powerful, though-provoking film worth owning on Blu-ray!

3259624,2,B000YATOOE,"The entire script has a fabricated make believe, unreal feel to it. Starting with a stereotypic scenario of a female piano teacher (Shin-ae) with a misbehaving child and recently deceased husband, suddenly having her car breakdown and is rescued by a mechanic who later becomes her stalker. Thus begins her process of moving to a small town to start life over again. Only to encounter almost cartoonish characters in the townspeople who spend their lives gossiping; women practically living in beauty salons and gorging on snacks while gossiping; males smoking and checking out the genitals of females; and everyone embracing the evangelism of Christianity through cleansing control of everyone else's lives. Shin-ae loses her son to a kidnapping/murder by the local teacher who suddenly after 40 years decides to be a murderer - sure! As a result Shin-ae vacillates between theft, vandalism, sex, God and no-God in a too cartoonish fabricated manner. Bizarre that the stalking, most self-serving individual may have turned out to be kindest person. Not clear.

It may have been the director's intent to showcase an entire town in such a fashion - as if there was a dark undercurrent to their fallacious facade. A common theme, but there are better ways to show in a clear and poignant manner the roles and interplay of belief, skepticism, love, loss, self-greed, materialism and evangelism without resorting to such cookie cutter figurines as portrayed here.",1322352000,6,1459,5.182203389830509

3259627,5,B000YATOOE,"Many things have been said about Jeon Do-Yeon's performance in `Secret Sunshine'.  In fact, many have hailed it as one of the finest turns in the past decade.  Sadly, many still haven't seen it, but now that it has an official US release and is finally on DVD maybe many more will get their chance.

Please take that chance.

I may be rash in saying this, but it needs saying; what Jeon Do-Yeon does in this film is beyond remarkable.  In fact, it may be the best performance by any actor or actress to splash across the big screen in the past ten years or so.  Seriously, maybe twenty.  I don't say this with ignorance either, considering that I watch a lot of films and have seen nearly every `raved' performance to come out of the last few decades.  There is a complexity, a subtle layering that is so often overlooked when actors and or actresses attempt a character like Shin-ae.  Here you have a tired and worn woman.  She is soulless, but not in the typical sense of the word.  Her husband, her lying, cheating husband is dead and now, after she has made steps to move on and sever her old life from her very skin, she has a major setback when her young son is ripped from her life.  Shin-ae lacks a soul because everything that made her alive inside is gone.  Whenever this type of character presents itself, it is usually portrayed with layer upon layer of theatrical grief.  That isn't the case here.  A lot of times when this character is created there is a one-note vibe that seeps from its pores.  That isn't the case here either.  Instead, Shin-ae becomes a living breathing dead woman.  She has her outbursts, but they all feel connected to a place of earnestness.  When she screams and wales and beats her chest while attending church; you feel it as if it were happening in your own living room.  But there is more.  When she tries to sell herself for mindless pleasure, you cry for her because you understand the depth of her pain.  When she cracks in the face of her own tragedy, you heart falls into your stomach.

Yes, Jeon Do-Yeon does so much with her face.

That phone call.

That prison meeting.

The only negative I can muster is that, outside Jeon's performance MAKES this film.  I honestly don't think it can hold up without her impressive shoulders there to steady it.  It's not that the film is bad at all, and it covers such intensely controversial ground, but walking away from this film I think of nothing more than Jeon's marvelous performance.  I have nothing else to say.  The movie is very good, but Jeon is so good that she overshadows the rest of everything.

8231654,5,B000YATOOE,"One of the finest cinematic examples of the blurred line between blind faith and madness. This film explores the very depths of grief, organized religion and brittle religious doctrines with an exhaustingly powerful performance from Jeon Do-yeon (winning best actress at Cannes for this role). God-centric faiths take a bit of a beating at first glance, but the film is much more profound than that. Its an astute observation of immorality justified by theological beliefs and the love of God.

8231659,5,B000YATOOE,"Milyang is a town like anywhere else in South Korea. Its Chinese translation is ""secret sunshine"". Lee Chang-dong's Secret Sunshine (2007) is a film about an average town,but its an extraordinary story about finding a new life elsewhere,being reborn for its heroine Shin-ae(Jeon Do-yeon).But nothing is what it seems. Shin-ae's husband died in a recent car accident, and Milyang is the hometown he always yearned to return to and now Shin-ae has done this with her 7 year old son Jun. She has set up a piano school and found herself the focus of local attention,not all of it wanted. Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho) the friendly mechanic who fixed her stalled car into town,has become a persistent suitor. Most of the other residents are less kind,disapproving of the big cheese who's looking for a property investment. The pharmacist,who tells Shin-ae that the cure for all her ailments is the Lord Jesus Christ.""Maybe you believe only in what you can see. You doubt what you can't see"".This seems a challenge the film maker has posed both to himself and to his heroine: to find meaning beyond the visible;the impossibility of certainty in the absence of evidence. Cinema's try at transcendence.

This film is remarkable-reminding us of what we have lost in the West-in returning to normality, a renewed simplicity, just plain-looking shots. This acts as an important grounding force,to counteract the mysticism of religion,so that we can approach religion without cosmic grandiosity. Here we get a lucid,hard-won,clear-sighted view. Following a tragedy,Shin-ae joins the evangelical Christian church and then she is on a roller-coaster ride from the depths of grief to the dizzying heights of religious ecstacy. She is a multi-layered ,richly developed character with a real relationship with God,capable of deep insight and emotional extremes. Lee is sceptical of organized religion,showing anger at its hypocrisy and Karaoke sing-a-longs. Shin-ae turns from blind love to violent break-up. There is no mockery. Lee shows how we use religion and religion uses us,how Shin-ae gains comfort in her darkest moments from the Christian community. She is perceived by her family as tearless at the funeral but also the most profoundly suffering soul,catatonic. The once constant source of sunshine in a film of shifting tones - thriller,comedy,melodrama-is the bumbling Jong-chan,the least likely of supports,friends,joiner of the church for her sake,then finding it beneficial. Jeon Do-yeon's risky,volatile performance deserved to be celebrated at Cannes. The film ends with shot of pure sunlight on a patch of ground,what we do see and know.",1389484800,,2634,5.346987951807229

8231661,5,B000YATOOE,"Yesterday, I watched the 2007 Criterion Collection film ""Secret Sunshine"" by South Korean director Lee Chang-dong.

The film is a psychological drama about a recently widowed woman from Seoul moving to her late husband's much smaller home town with her young son to start a new life. Soon after she gets established, tragedy strikes and the film becomes an emotional and psychological roller-coaster from there on in which the broader South Korean pentecostal church plays a big part.

As a Christian, the thing I find most compelling about the film is the way it looks unflinchingly at the way religion and Christianity play into people's lives and the various good and bad, healthy and unhealthy reasons people embrace religion. Although the film seems at some points to be a simple work of proselyting, it becomes clear later on that the main character's relationship with God is very much more complicated than can be easily resolved. I like this exploration because oftentimes I believe the path of Christianity tends to get presented as a neat and tidy course, but real life often tends to be much more complicated and messy.

Aside from this, another reason for the recommendation is the acting of the mother Jeon Do-Yeon in the film and the overall style. Her acting is so riveting and flawless, that it often times seems more like a documentary than a work of fiction.

I give it a 4.5 star rating for great acting, depth and the way in which it encourages spiritual and philosophical reflection. Film is a bit slow in the middle and ending could be a bit less ambiguous.",1383696000,2,1580,4.819188191881919

8231663,5,B000YATOOE,"I enjoy psychological films. I like seeing characters undergo psychological changes. Those types of films entertain me, even change my views of the world sometimes.

Secret Sunshine is one such film. In it a woman experiences a set of major events that send her spiraling into a psychological downfall, then up through enlightenment, then, finally, she falls deeper and deeper until true enlightenment is possible.

I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen this yet, so I'll keep it brief. The woman loses her husband and then moves to his hometown with her son, hoping to start over. Once there she is greeted by a local neighbor who tells her that the only way to be truly happy is to find God, join the church, and become a religious citizen. She is hesitant, explaining that she doesn't believe in such things.

A few more things happen (I'm refraining from saying for spoilers sake) and she decides to join the church, finding God and weeping in an emotional scene (the actress does a wonderful job here, as well as throughout the entire film) which leads to her apparent happiness.

But not everything is as it seems...and when the woman decides to apply one of God's teachings to her daily life, the results aren't what she had expected. She falls into darkness once again, this time at a frightening speed.

What happens after this can only be witnessed by watching the film, since I don't want to give away any more.

Secret Sunshine is a masterpiece of psychological cinema. It takes a step back and examines how Religion can affect a human life, both positively and negatively, and the film isn't afraid of pulling punches. This is an emotionally draining film, but I found the ending to be truly enlightening. Others might feel differently towards the ending.

Viewers with strong religious beliefs that can't view this film with an open mind might be disturbed by Secret Sunshine.

Viewers with open minds, regardless of life beliefs, and fans of ""different"" cinema will enjoy this film.

I couldn't take my eyes off every frame of Secret Sunshine, and the way the film ends gives me hope. Film: 5/5 stars.

The blu-ray is a Criterion release, so the video and audio are perfect. There are plenty of extras including a booklet inside the blu-ray case with an interesting article. Video/Audio/Extras gets 5/5 stars.

Overall: 5/5 stars. Secret Sunshine is the best film I've seen that deals with Religion. Its also a great ""character study"" of a woman undergoing psychological changes. I recommend this film highly to viewers with open minds.

Rating: Not Rated, likely Rated R. Minimal strong language, some sexual content (which serves the story well) and some disturbing violence. Ages 17 and up.",1369267200,8,2735,4.858064516129033
