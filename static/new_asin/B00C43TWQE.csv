5690483,5,B00C43TWQE,I wouldn't buy just any movie.  I only buy movies that get good reviews.  Good story with believable character's. Wow!,1381881600,3,118,4.85
5690484,4,B00C43TWQE,"My husband and I really enjoyed this series. The characters were colorful and fun... Detective DeLuca tries so hard against all odds to discover the culprits in each mystery and it's always an ordeal given his bosses are more political than effective, the Germans are in Italy during WWII and Mussolini is in power for Episode 1. Nazi's, fascists and murders make for a complicated backdrop with crazy characters galore.",1381795200,4,420,5.014285714285714
5690485,2,B00C43TWQE,"This is so campy, I thought it was a spoof but it's not. Clothing, cars etc are expert but the acting and storyline leave you wondering why they bothered making this movie.",1378771200,3,172,4.40625
5690486,5,B00C43TWQE,"My husband and I loved this series and hope they will make more.  We love well done period pieces  and we like foreign films, any language, but this one really hit home for my husband.  He was born as the bombs were falling, and he and  his parents and relatives went through this and the rebuilding of Italy.  They fled Croatia, which was Italy, at the time, as many Italian citizens were forced to do to avoid communism and they settled in the north of Italy. I don't understand much Italian so was glad there were English subtitles. My husband's mother is 91 and agrees this is how it was in northern Italy during those times.  It is a real bonus to learn about history while watching a well acted interesting mystery series.",1377820800,17,728,4.43609022556391
5690487,5,B00C43TWQE,"Loved the period piece...great acting....excellent coverage of Italian fascism. Would like to see more Det. Deluca...hopefully some form of exoneration and promotion to ""questura..",1375833600,8,180,6.541666666666667
5690488,5,B00C43TWQE,"There is a lot of action in this series. It has the feel of a premium movie; with plenty of action, pretty girls, and intrigue. Many US productions have degenerated to dialogue only with no substantial filming or action; not this. Enjoyable watching but not for the lazy because you have to pay attention to keep up. I recommend Detective De Luca, the Movies (4) are in Italian with English subtitles and are well done. The action takes place during World War II and is instructive as to Italian culture, politics, and police work.",1372896000,13,531,4.659574468085107
5690489,5,B00C43TWQE,"This is a very good series for people that enjoy Italian detective shows. Shipment was prompt, high quality DVDs and the show itself is well done. The WW2 setting makes it even more enjoyable. Just wish there were more than 4 episodes to the series. It is a PAL format DVD, so regular US DVD players will not work with this DVD. Either need a DVD Player that will support PAL format DVDs or convert it using a computer.",1366070400,5,419,4.3164556962025316
5690490,4,B00C43TWQE,Exciting - well acted and directed. Captures the atmosphere  of  the Fascist era. Always a joy to listen to the beauty of the Italian language!,1420761600,,143,4.68
5690491,5,B00C43TWQE,"A spectacular and gorgeous reflection of Italy before, during and after the war. De Luca is fabulous and so very attractive as well as vulnerable. Beautifully shot.",1417132800,2,164,5.111111111111111
5690492,5,B00C43TWQE,"excellent directing, settings, plot and characters with superb acting.  a bit 'existentialist' i.e. relative morality i.e. irony of hunting criminals while part of a criminal organization albeit perhaps a more pervasive issue such as Arjuna and Krishna in the Bhagava Gita.",1407024000,3,273,5.658536585365853

5690494,2,B00C43TWQE,Rather wooden acting and characters that are caricatures for me,1405814400,,63,5.4
5690495,5,B00C43TWQE,"From Italy comes this four feature length episode series about Detective De Luca, an excellent change from English-speaking sleuths. What really sets this series apart is the time and place: Italy between the years 1938 and 1948, a time of chaos and upheaval, a time that encompassed the Second World War (1939-1945).

Beginning in 1938, we find Detective De Luca working within a Facist state, under the firm dictatorship of il Duce: Benito Mussolini. Mussolini was determined to restore Italy to the greatness of the Roman Empire, appealing to national pride much the same way Hitler appealed to a sense of national pride in Germany. Fascist Italy was allied to Hitlers Germany at this time in history though Italy stayed out of the conflict until the fall of France in 1940. Of Mussolinis invasion of France when they were most vulnerable, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said On this tenth day of June 1940, the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor.

Hence, beginning in 1940, Italy fought against Great Britain and her allies in Greece and both East and North Africa.

This makes for a totally unique background for a detective series. Politics aside, Detective De Luca is a cop who won't take no for an answer as he strives for the truth no matter how ugly things get, even if it means defying his superiors. This is a classic good guy characteristic, of course, and it works in part because the scripts are intelligent, but primarily because actor Alessandro Prezioni, with his striking good looks (dark hair and piercing blue eyes) has immense appeal. Though handsome, he is also world-weary and barely has a penny to his name. What he does have, however, is a pronounced sense of honour and integrity. Audiences will root for that every time, no matter what language the hero speaks.

By the time of the second episode, set in April 1945, De Luca is something of a celebrity in parts of Italy. Apparently he was in the right place at the right time and saved Mussolinis life on one occasion. He is welcomed in Bologna as a hero. It should be noted that by 1945, Italy was a country divided by civil war. Mussolini was a charismatic leader but not a good military strategist and even by1943, Italys dreams of Roman restoration were completely shattered, with Mussolini arrested by order of Italys King Victor Emmanuel III.

The Germans rescued Mussolini and installed him in northern Italy, as leader of a puppet state, supported by Nazi occupation. Bologna is located is located in the north and was generally still sympathetic to Mussolini at the time of this episode, but fighting was always near at hand, and when the Germans pulled out, things became even more chaotic. It is around this period that episode two is situated. The burning question amid all the crime solving becomes, is De Luca really a Fascist?

Episode three is set two months later, around the time of Mussolinis execution. Arguably the best of the four films, Cloudy Summer finds De Luca in the middle of a partisan mystery, where his fame as the man who saved Mussolini on one occasion is a death sentence. Set away from the city, this episode has a pastoral feel, with a goat playing a prominent role in the proceedings.

Finally we are back in Bologna. It is now 1948 and De Luca says it best when he says I am neither Fascist or partisan: Im a cop. Im loyal to whoever allows me to do my job. Thus, ever the man on the outside, De Luca is inevitably facing pressure from within the ranks as well as the pressure to solve the crime. While his future as a policeman is up in the air it is possible he has finally found lasting love.

DETECTIVE DE LUCA is an excellent police show with the added interest of its politically-charged setting, about which most people in North America will have limited knowledge.",1397433600,10,3831,4.673590504451038
5690496,5,B00C43TWQE,Detective DeLuca is a noble character who finds his way through the troubled times of Facist Italy. His focus to combat crime is admirable and compelling; sad at times.,1395619200,2,168,4.827586206896552
5690497,5,B00C43TWQE,"this is like an historical novel where the stories are set against the history of WWII in a way that adds to the understanding of the complexity of WWII & its aftermath that history books do not relate.  Well written, well acted, good practice in Italian with excellent subtitles in English.  enjoyable entertainment as well as education.  Very important vista of wartime for those of us fortunate to have never lived it.",1393027200,4,421,4.819444444444445
5690498,1,B00C43TWQE,"This dvd features a homicide detective in l938 fascist Italy. Sounded like a great idea. Unfortunately the producers got the l930s look completely wrong. The protagonist is pink and healthy, rolling with muscles, with a sculpted shirt. He certainly doesn't look like a self described ""poor Italian policeman."" The dvd has the required scenes of fascist bellowing but it misses all the gorgeous dertails: the petty jealousies, the neighbor watching neighbor, the small cheating,  that make Foyle's War such a marvelous portrait of wartime Europe.
You want to tell the writers to just look at Foyle's War and learn how to set a period. The plot is so lame that for a while I thought the author was attempting a deliberate sendup. The body of a whore is found on a beach. The beach happens to be next door to Mussolini's beach villa, so pressure comes to solve the murder fast. The muscular detective finds hi jinks in high places and pressure then comes to veer him off the wealthy. And he sleeps with one of the main suspects because no female can resist him. Have we seen this plot before?  I wasted my money and am sorry I purchased this dvd.",1391212800,11,1143,4.653465346534653
5690499,5,B00C43TWQE,"Because Italian tall actors who are handsome make me want to identify with them as that I am tall and slender
and very Italian looking and girls love that ""look""and Italian actors are so very good at their ""craft"" and put
American actors to shame because American actors don't know squat about dialogue only about running and
screaming and stunt men....menca.

Alessandro makes all men  who have taste want to look like him.",1384387200,2,424,4.794520547945205
