8221577,2,B000W8IC14,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the DVD is engaging and simplistic but it teaches wrong words like Juicy instead of juice. An adjective for a noun!!! granted it is meant for a child less than 18 mths of age but thats when the foundations of grammer are laid. Also the music is as loud as the phonics which makes it very hard to hear it. But i was shocked when they showed a toddler trying to eat a whole strawberry and an unpeeled banana! Also while teaching the words for objects in the bathroom , they use the word ""Soapy"" for soap and the visual shows a baby not only handling but trying to eat the soap bar wincingas the bubbles land on her head and looks clearly uncomfortable, Looks like they really did not care about how the child feels while shooting all of this... not good at all.

On the flip side, the pictures are cute and the colors are pleasing. Iwould rather use a book to teach phonics with me talking to my child.

BTW the music is about to put me to sleep",1234828800,,983,4.195767195767195
8221578,5,B000W8IC14,"This is a great video for babies and toddlers under 2.  It is not for older children or adults looking for a perfect teaching tool or graphic display.  It is very simple and calming and teaches very basic words.  My son (now 26 months old) did great with it and even now will ask to watch it if he is really tired.  I highly recommend it - just don't look for perfect words (does a 12 month really have to know ""strawberry"" instead of ""berry"" ???).",1228176000,,448,4.174418604651163
