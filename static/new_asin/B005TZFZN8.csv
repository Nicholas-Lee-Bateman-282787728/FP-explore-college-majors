It's NG and excellent.  Also they provide a NG short on the research to reveal the original route of the first landfall originally filmed in 1983.",1438905600,,350,4.629032258064516

8486728,4,B005TZFZN8,"Columbus returned to the New World in 1494 with numerous ships and a cast of about 1,000 - including some women and a few blacks. Horses, pigs, and rats also were brought with. The Spaniards founded a settlement named La Isabela in today's Dominican Republic. His fort of La Navidad, constructed during his first trip to search for gold, had been destroyed by native Tainos. Columbus hoped to find great amounts of gold, and later desperation over the paucity of the metal drove him and his men to abuse the natives - both imprisoning about 1,600 and taxing the remaining males. Some of the locals were sent back to Spain. Several years later, after losing at least six ships to hurricane storms and about 200 men to what researchers believe was mostly acute native diseases facilitated by starvation and scurvy, Columbus returned to Spain with the remnants of his men and ships. However, this was not before hunger and disease had led to the disillusion and mutiny by some of his men.

Columbus' leadership throughout the expedition proved sorely wanting. First, because of his unwillingness to drop his search for gold - even after numerous searches had found very little. This led to his men abusing the natives and impaired cooperation. Secondly, for failing to adopt to local methods and food - thus, when the Spaniard's crops failed they were faced with existing with greatly reduced rations and suffering from scurvy.

The researchers concluded that diseases from the Old World eventually wiped out the natives living there, while diseases from the New World killed numerous Spaniards. What amazed (and bothered me) was the fact that much of the research effort was staffed and funded by Indiana University - seemingly not a priority for U.S. taxpayers and students.",1338940800,,1773,4.966329966329966

This is a 50 minute DVD that does not just deal with Columbus' ships but his colony of La Isabela. In 1494 Columbus sailed to the new world for the 2nd time, still thinking he was off the coast of Japan. Six ships he had were sunk in the very bay they thought would provide shelter.
This DVD deals with evidence, scant though it might be, that historians have, of a hurricane, crops that would not thrive and most of all Europeans that would not adapt to a new land. Much is a mystery and this film shows 2 teams, one in the bay and one on land investigating into what happened here. Some questions are answered but much mystery remains. The divers are hindered by silty waters and deep white mud that acts almost like wet cement dust. On land there is little evidence left and bones found do not reveal disease that hit their owners quickly.
There is interesting information and scenes for those who are fascinated by archeology, both on land and water. Reenactments are done and there is an excellent comparison that this fleet of ships landing here was for the Indians like alien space ships would be for us today.

There is an additional 8 minute video on Columbus' landfall, but the sound is poor and there are no subtitles as there are in the main 50 minute feature. What we see mainly are the faces of the historians and archeologists looking at the area. The sound in this 8 minute excerpt is muddy and the dialogue extremely hard to follow. It would have been better to have been omitted.
The 50 minute film would appeal to those interested in the history of Columbus, his impact on the New World and archeology.",1331424000,,1633,4.45819397993311
