7964239,3,B000068MB3,A decent skate DVD worth a watch. Some stunning footage in the beginning with a wintery Finland. Some good talented skating and a decent soundtrack!,1397260800,,148,4.96
7964240,5,B000068MB3,"This has to be one of the best skateboarding videos that has ever been made. Every part in the video is worth watching. The level of skateboarding in this video is unbelievable considering how old it is. If you don't own this video, I suggest you hurry up and buy!",1390348800,,264,4.3
7964241,5,B000068MB3,"Still one of the best skate videos made. If you haven't seen this video yet, DO SO. Simply crazy how so many amazing skateboarders could be on one team at the same time.",1340755200,,169,4.151515151515151
7964242,5,B000068MB3,"I remember buying this video when I was 7. It was a black cover and the video cassette was red. I was stoked by it but as i was small, I really didn't know if as a skating film it was good or not, I was just amazed by the tricks. 11 years later it Turns out that its one of the best ever. Im super happy i bought this video.",1338854400,,324,3.5774647887323945
7964243,5,B000068MB3,"Going into Menikmati the documentary feel in the beginning made me worry a bit.  I've got absolutely nothing against a skating documentary but after seeing the names of the eS team members I could not wait to see their skate parts.  Luckily, Menikmati doesn't disapoint.  It has an overly formulaic structure of including a skater intro followed by a regular skate part and then a slow-mo section, but the skating is so amazing that it doesn't really take away from your enjoyment (although I will say that the regular motion shots included as a dvd extra were so much more entertaining than their slow-mo counterparts and I've watched that montage in regular motion again and again).  Tom Penny sticks out as always.  His skating and the intro to his part really caught my attention and it was great to see on the dvd extras a chance to look at penny skating from a young age and watching that progression as he developed his skating skills over the years.  Highly, highly recommended!",1066435200,3,986,4.7368421052631575
7964244,5,B000068MB3,"This isn't your standard skate video, in fact this is a skate film.  It is beautifully shot, and the use of intro's, slow motion, and documentry type footage for each skater is pure genious.  But the best part of this DVD, besides the extra footage....the skating of course.  Eric Koston's part (which is the best by far) is a fitting end to such a great montage of skate clips.  In fact you see so much great skating before you get to Eric Koston, that you almost forget to recognize how great Koston really is.  If you're into street skating you will enjoy parts by Sarri, Creager, McCrank, Penny, and Koston....but if Vert is your forte, don't worry cuz Burnquist fills that void great.  The music here is also the best I have ever heard for a skate film.  It's not your usual punk or rap, but instead more relaxed and synced with the actual skating that is occuring.  And perhaps the music is the best part of this all.  There is so much to see and experience with this..if at all you want to see what great filming and skating, and music is all about then get this now!  It is a work of art.",1056153600,4,1096,4.302439024390244
7964245,5,B000068MB3,"It would seem that with the popularity of Tony Hawk Pro Skater(1,2,3,4) that most skate videos have sought to become super intense affairs which feature skaters just trying to go as big as possible, accompanied by an equally intense soundtrack. However, this is not the case for Menikmati.  For the eS team it is about keeping it low-key and relaxed while putting down some sweet footage.  While there are some big rails and stair sets, as well as, vert it is really the techinical aspects of the skating which makes this movie truly noteworthy.  Combine great skating with some amazing worldwide backdrops and a layed back soundtrack Menikmati succeeds in going against the main stream current of popular skating while still producing an enjoyable and progressive movie. The icing on the cake is Tom Penny's segment; plus, the DVD has great extra footage.",1042243200,5,856,4.972027972027972
7964246,4,B000068MB3,"This video is unlike any other skateboarding video out there. It visits different countries and introduces us to the es skate team. This 60 minute DVD has a cool low-key soundtrack, incredible skating and some documentary-style film footage of Thailand, Canada, England and Brazil. We meet Arto Saari, the reclusive Tom Penny, Rick McCrank, Eric Koston and more as we travel to the places they grew up and learned the art of skateboarding. Also contains 35 minutes of bonus footage, including home video of Tom Penny skating as a kid in England. Under 20 bucks? Grab it now. You will not regret it.",1040083200,3,598,4.815533980582524
