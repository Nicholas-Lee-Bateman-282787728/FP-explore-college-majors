2171005,5,B000674DO6,This is awesome and long Oout Of Print.  Luckily I picked it up years ago and I still find myself watching it every so often.  Contains the only recorded footage of the family from back then.,1111622400,6,191,4.277777777777778
2171006,5,B000674DO6,"When this film first came out it did not get very good reviews but later it became the more appreciated. This is the best film ever made on Manson and his people. When the Tate-LaBianca murder trial just started filmmakers Robert Hendricson and Laurence Merrick joined the Manson group and filmed them in their natural enviorment both at Spahn Ranch and in Death Valley. They also filmed Manson and the girls as they were on their way to the courtroom. Very unigue footage and many interesting interviews with girls who were cellmates with Susan Atkins including call girl Ronnie Howard, also with Family member Paul Watkins, Manson's former cellmate, Steve Grogan, Cathereine Share, Bruce Davis, Lynn Fromme, Sandra Good, Mary Brunner and Nancy Pitman. You will see the Manson girls take their clothes of and loading firearms and handling knifes and warning of terror and justifying their acts. If you are into Manson and have not seen it GET IT BY ALL MEANS !!!!!",1106438400,9,965,4.890243902439025

8039500,5,B000674DO6,"I've had this movie/documentary since the 1980s.  To put it bluntly, it's riveting.  Much of the narration is done by Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecuting attorney who did a great job in the prosecution of Manson and his ""family"".  Interviews with the Manson ""girls"" and other former members of the family, the sheriff of that county and prisoners who once shared a cell with Manson  help to make this one documentary film one of the best ever.  All the movies made about Manson since then really pale in comparison.",1359763200,,513,4.784090909090909
8039501,5,B000674DO6,"Bizarre documentary. Excellent film. It's the only real film about the 'Family'.However,the film starts with the Tate/LoBianca trial and spans over some four years. Half the flock is caged and the remaining brethern are like lost sheep in search of the bell-wether. I was stunned at the raw emotion the documentary conveyed. I felt sorry for Nancy Pitman aka Brenda,whose brother was killed in the Vietnam war. She was a member on the fringe,who then became a devout follower of Manson's harem. Manson is a victim himself too. I think he was simply used by more cunning people,who knew some things about Charlie's life and situation. Charlie was just the fall-guy for Helter Skelter,perhaps a CIA plot to scare hippies off the streets of San Francisco. One thing that many watchers of the trial ,and even Vincent Bugliosi himself perhaps,did not understand was that to what extent the misuse of 'Witchcraft' played in the mind-set of the 'Family'.They just thought they were crazed hippies on drugs. I think they were channeling a lot of negative energy against innocent people,and that's what destroyed their desert paradise. If the Manson Family had continued to survive,it may have wound up as a Jonestown atrocity or a Waco massacre. And if Manson became more sophisticated,he may have turned the desert collective into a depraved gulag concentration camp for hapless drifters. This is a chilling documentary on the real aftermath of the post-60s ,not to be dismissed or easily forgotten.",1208822400,,1492,5.093877551020408
8039502,5,B000674DO6,"As most know, MANSON has never been authorized for DVD release, but late next month, both the original MANSON and the brand new ""Inside the MANSON Gang"" will be made available for DVD purchase on [...].
Do not let this discourage you from purchasing legitimate MANSON VHS tapes, as they have become collector's items. The real value will continue with the original box and the new DVD will not have the same box art.  As well, it is unlikely that MANSON will ever be re-released in the VHS format.",1200787200,4,497,4.584269662921348
8039503,5,B000674DO6,"This immensely. I like it. I like the mind set we can see in the Manson family:What made them tick,what their life was about. I enjot humane and honest treatmeNts of such things.",1175040000,2,178,4.424242424242424
8039504,5,B000674DO6,because it shows the human problem as it exists. These people could have come from anywhere. Humanity is a hard thing when life's hard. Darlene Ferrin died as a result of a murderer. Let's hope someone confesses to the Zodiac murders as Charles Manson seems to think he knows who did it. But is there a new suspect?Why hAve uncovered letters to the Chronicle iN San Francisci been ignored?,1174953600,2,389,4.6521739130434785
8039505,4,B000674DO6,"If the ""Family"" Interests you then this Video goes hand in hand with Bugliousi's Helter Skelter.  It brings the book to life.  For all of it short comings this is really all there is available in the way of manson documentry and is both enlightening and worth a look.",1168560000,4,267,4.428571428571429
8039506,5,B000674DO6,I had my DVD in hand on the third day upon placing my order.  Shows great.  Got exactly what I was hoping for.  I am so glad I didn't spend more money on one of the more expensive sellers.  Thanks hardtofinddvds!,1159488000,2,212,4.097560975609756
8039507,4,B000674DO6,One of my favorite documentaries. Very creepy look inside the Family. Highly recommended.,1157932800,4,89,5.923076923076923
8039508,5,B000674DO6,"Don't even debate it: This documentary absolutely blows away anything - and I mean ANYTHING - else done on the Manson family.  It is the most detailed, close-up look at the thoughts, feelings and acid crazed views of the Manson family.  It's an amazing window into their LSD-soaked perspective.  It is the only video out there that works hard to give you the actual family members' insight into the ""meaning"" of what the Manson family was all about.

If you have any interest in Manson, this will blow anything you've ever seen before completely out of the water.

It is ALSO a great view of the general transition from idealism to degeneracy that took place in the late sixties.  The fact is that Manson and his family epitomized the perversion and decay that had overtaken the sixties by the end of the decade - a decade which, for a brief period, had been an idealistic moment in time.

Unfortunately, by '69, it was no longer the experimental and idealistic people who were defining the decade.  It was people like the murderous, degenerate, LSD- crazed followers of Charles Manson.

If you're attached to the ""good"" and idealistic aspect of the sixties, this video will illustrate for you - dramatically - how it all went wrong.  And even if you're not into all that heavy stuff, it's simply an amazing documentary.",1134864000,14,1320,4.724890829694323
