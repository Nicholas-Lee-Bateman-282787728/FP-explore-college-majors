7131459,4,B00WFDOYU2,"Thought I would have to wait a lot longer (like until perhaps Spring 2016) to get the Season 7 One Piece DVD's but they are arriving starting this summer.  Excellent!  A few supporting characters we've seen before are coming back along with a bunch of new characters, most notably the 11 Supernovas (which include Luffy and Zoro) that are featured on the box cover.  Trafalgar Law, presently one of Luffy's most stalwart allies, is appropriately right in the center of the picture.  Another notable new and very awesome character is Silvers Rayleigh, the former first mate of the Pirate King Gol D. Roger.  And of course, these episodes have my very favorite opening theme of the series (""One World"").

With this volume, the subtitled videos watchable on the One Piece Official website come full circle (around 2009, Funimation began releasing subs of the newly run One Piece anime episodes from Japan, starting at about Episode 390 which is on this volume).  The Voyage where Boa Hancock debuts will probably be coming out around next Thanksgiving and I'm definitely looking forward to that!",1430352000,9,1092,4.967032967032967
7131460,5,B00WFDOYU2,"So much has been said, See photo for info as to English 5.1 and WS 16/9. The discs were reversed in the cases as previously described and one had the label in upside down; all easy fixes and I must admit a bit fun. Oh thanks to ""By Amazon Customer on November 12, 2015"". Rereading your review helped.",1450828800,,300,4.189655172413793

7131462,5,B00WFDOYU2,"One of my favorite arcs in the series, mainly because it introduces so many characters (the other nine Super Novas, who are on the cover) that are some of my all time favorite characters in the show, and in some case in all anime. The best part of this DVD set is on Disc 2 at around 17:30 minutes in where all the Super Novas are introduced. I literally went back that scene over and over, probably over ten times, because I think it is a bad-ass way to introduce these characters and you are waiting to see even more! The rest of the material is pretty good as well, I just can not get enough of that Super Novas introduction scene!

I first saw these episodes online years back in Japanese with English subtitles. So I was curious to see what their English voices would sound like. Some I don't mind, a few I even like better than the Japanese voices, and a couple I could not stand the English voice acting. But that's the great thing about this, you have the option between Japanese with English subtitles or English.

Other than some of the English voice acting, which is really not a problem given you can hear the Japanese voice actor, is that the discs were in the wrong case. Disc 1 is really in Disc 2's case and vice versa, which caused me to have a minor-fake heart attack until I tried out the other disc. To say in the least I was relieved that they were just switched around and I did not get two Disc 2s.",1447286400,3,1421,4.239852398523985

7131480,5,B00WFDOYU2,"Finally the Sabaody arc is here.  I use to watch the Japanese version over and over mainly because of the Celestial Dragons and how they treated their slaves.  If anyone lays a hand on these people, a fleet admiral will be sent to dealt with the criminal. They were cruel and their snooty behavior made my blood boil.  When the straw hats's newly acquired mermaid friend, Camie is kidnapped by slave traders, the Straw hats race against time to find her before she is sold.  Several of the crew members arrive at the auction house that she is being held believing they can buy her back.  Of course plans never go as they should because one of the Dragons bids on her.  Just when all hope is lost, Luffy storms in.  His new friend and once enemy Hatchan is shot by the Celestial Dragon.  This pisses off Luffy and he punches the guy in the face thus ending Season Seven  Voyage One.",1437696000,,881,4.388888888888889

7131487,5,B00WFDOYU2,"I have to say, this set is awesome.  While it isn't really action heavy, it does have a lot of world building to it.  Each new character that they introduce in this set are fantastic.  The best have to be the supernova's though, and they did a fantastic job at casting these characters.  their voices are perfect.  the story in this set is also pretty good.  it starts out pretty light hearted, but it does grow darker as it goes and has a finish that  is sure to excite.  These set of episodes are great and is definitely a set I will watch over and over again.",1436832000,,562,4.186915887850467
