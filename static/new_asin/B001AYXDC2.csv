In the first DVD the cases were interesting.  Here they were run of the mill.  The only thing I enjoyed were the extras.  As always her interviews are very interesting.  I would save my money and buy another one of her books instead.",1223510400,3,348,4.119402985074627
3474291,2,B001AYXDC2,This product got lost in the mail service and bounced around the United States while I begged Amazon to replace it without any success. Finally after one month they gace me a refund. The DVD arrived and they provided shipping back to them and gave me a refund including the shipping I paid which I thought was very admirable.,1223251200,,325,4.52542372881356
3474292,4,B001AYXDC2,"Allumination Filmworks bring Judge Judy back to DVD with ""Second to None"", a compilation of ten Judge Judy cases, running a total of around 120 minutes (although the back of the box states it's only 100 minutes).

The cases featured are:

* PATTERSON VS. JIMERSON - A 16-year-old girl (Patterson) sues a prom date that didn't show up (Jimerson) for the cost of doing her hair and buying a prom outfit

* REPSHER VS. ZILE - A woman (Repsher) sues the owner of a kennel (Zile) for misrepresenting a mixed-breed dog as a Yorkshire Terrier

* CASIMIR VS. RANDOLPH - A teenage boy (Casimir) sues for an unprovoked attack by a fellow youth (Randolph); he counters with the claim that the former boy's girlfriend subsequently stabbed him in the heart, nearly killing him

* BROWN VS. PRITCHETT - A twentysomething man (Brown) sues a 13-year-old girl (Pritchett), for whom he routinely purchased alcohol, for filing a false police report

* HACKETT VS. SCHELL - A man (Hackett) sues the on-again, off-again boyfriend - and admitted abuser (Schell) - of a woman whom he was walking home with, for an unprovoked physical attack

* GALLARZO VS. COSIO - The new girlfriend (Gallarzo) of an elementary school girl's father turns up at the elementary school graduation; girl's biological mother (Cosio) is not best pleased and mounts a verbal attack on the girlfriend.

* WATTS VS. SORROWS - Purchaser of a new home (Watts) is shocked when she [allegedly] finds an unknown man having sex in aforementioned home [Sorrows] on day they were due to move in

* OSMAN VS. BENJAMIN - Teenage drama gone serious: in a lengthy (26 mins) and complicated case, Osman claims defendant (Benjamin) allowed her to be ""set-up"" for a physical assault

* DAVENPORT VS. FILKINS - Possibly the disc's highlights. Judy vents as eBay seller (Filkins) attempts to con buyers (including Davenport) into buying pictures of cellphones for hundreds of dollars

* DETTENHEIM VS. DETTENHEIM - A short (4 mins) open-and-shut case regarding damage to a vehicle that one sister stole from the other.

As with the 2007 release ""Justice Served"", each case is prefaced with a short clip of Judy espousing a moral or cautionary tale relevant to the case.

Extras include a three-minute reel of ""Judyisms"" (different to those ""Judyisms"" seen on the ""Justice Served"" DVD), two clips of Judy on Entertainment Tonight (one from 1997, one from 2008) and a tribute to Judy from The Montel Williams Show.

Packaging is a standard Amaray-type keepcase. There are no subtitles. The material is presented in 4:3 fullscreen, as it is aired on TV. The DVD is not region-coded.",1220400000,88,2614,4.884615384615385
3474293,5,B001AYXDC2,"Following the release of Judge Judy's first DVD, the hugely successful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judge-Judy-Justice-Served/dp/B000T28C68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judge Judy: Justice Served</a>, this is the latest best-of DVD from everyone's favorite Judge. ""Judge Judy: Second to None"" is 1 DVD and a total of 1 hour and 46 minutes in length which also includes bonuses as well. (By the way, Judge Judy's new season begins on 9/8.)

I love Judge Judy because she's always funny and completely wise. I've watched her show for years and what I appreciate the most about her is her consistency. She treats everyone the same and doesn't put up with any garbage. I was just watching Judge Judy the other day and some lady was suing her ex-boyfriend and she tried to bring up an affair and Judge Judy said, ""you want to talk about that, go somewhere else, but not here."" And I think that statement really embodies what her show is about. Another reason why I enjoy Judge Judy is because she is very fair and compassionate. She doesn't come to the bench spitting ricochets. Nope. It's only after her litigants either try to lie or show their complete foolishness does she get angry. The best words to describe Judge Judy and her show are: common sense. That's her show in a nutshell because she follows the laws of the land, but she also has basic common sense, which apparently some of her litigants neglect. Judge Judy also created the entire sub-genre of arbitration TV because her show is handled much more like a binding arbitrator in that she does not bang gavels and there is less reflection on money and more reflection on people and circumstances. It's no coincidence that nearly every single other court show on American TV is patterned after and adjudicated in the same method as Judge Judy's series because she set the standard.",1220140800,28,1884,5.077419354838709

3474307,5,B001AYXDC2,"I own both this DVD and the ""Justice Served"" DVD and they are both wonderful, showing everything I love about Judge Judy. I just wish there was more! 20 episodes is simply not enough to sake my thirst for the judge! Come on CBS, release more Judge Judy DVD's (full seasons? yes please!) I would buy them all!",1381449600,2,308,4.327586206896552
3474308,5,B001AYXDC2,I love Judge Judy. It is fun to watch her on T.V. I hope no one sues me and put me on Judge Judy she is tough.,1379116800,,110,3.111111111111111

3474311,5,B001AYXDC2,"I enjoy Judge Judy here in the UK. It's on CBS a lot. I never miss this when it's on. I have to say having watched many episodes of this programme there was only one episode that I felt her judgement was impaired, and that was the case of the housewife who had several children to look after and Judge Judy asked her why she did not have a job or could not get a job. Looking after children of school age is a job itself which I'm sure she knows but somehow overlooked. I do feel this case I have mentioned should be revisited.",1364083200,,527,4.0285714285714285
3474312,5,B001AYXDC2,This is a compilation of some of the best episodes in the first decade of Judge Judy.  She's really due for a new DVD!,1361318400,,118,3.9166666666666665

3474314,4,B001AYXDC2,"I like JJ  She is very entertaining and educational. Her slant on everything seems to be out in left field, but is more accurate than most",1352505600,,138,4.3076923076923075
3474315,5,B001AYXDC2,"Does anyone know why they are not releasing more Judge Judy? The 2 DVDs that exist were very successful and it has been a long time since anything has been released! She has done tens of thousands of cases during the course of this show not to mention that the show is not over, its still alive and well. If they could release it by season and maybe pick about 50 of the best cases and put them on DVD that would be wonderful. These 2 DVDs that are out now are great,but we want to see more! I have written to the Judge Judy website and tried to write to the company that came out with her current DVDs but I do not recieve  response. I encourage anyone to write to the company, write to Judge Judy herself even! Its a disservice that we as the fans are not able to see more of these shows. She is so wonderful and the shows are so entertaining that they just suck you right in. The DVDs have 5 stars from me, but I would really love to see more of these cases released to DVD, not just 9 or so cases released. Lets get Judge Judy out on DVD so we can enjoy the show in special DVD format.",1312761600,13,1089,3.9726027397260273
3474316,5,B001AYXDC2,"Very interesting. I've watched this show for years. Found episodes here that I'd never seen before. Judge Judy can be humorous, humorless, or just plain annoying, but she definitely keeps your attention. And the show is quite informative. You learn a lot about what's technically legal and what isn't. Buy and enjoy.",1309737600,,316,5.096153846153846

3474320,4,B001AYXDC2,"I watched the DVD in the middle of the night.  It was good; however, I have two complaints.  It was not long enough and I did not care for the quick, contrived introductions that Judge Judy made before each case.",1239062400,,212,4.275

3474322,4,B001AYXDC2,"Several compelling cases from the show - I believe a couple of them were longer than shown on TV. If you like the Judge Judy show, you will love this DVD. It also includes a couple of interviews with Judge Judy on Montel Williams, Entertainment Tonight, etc.  Great fun for fans of the show!",1238284800,2,291,4.388888888888889

3474324,3,B001AYXDC2,"I love Judge Judy! This DVD has a few really good cases, like the E-Bay Scammer Kelly Filken, but not all the rest are some of the better ones I have seen.

3474325,4,B001AYXDC2,"I have always enjoyed watching Judge Judy, and this is no exception here.  One of my favorite episodes is on this DVD, where a girl is taken to a party, not permitted to leave, and then ambushed at a gas station.  The betrayel of her supposed best friend, it's just disgusting.  Once again, Judy dispenses the justice, though one can be forgiven if they think she has an acid tongue.  Of course, most of those who get her venom rather tend to deserve it.  Oh well.  I had a great time watching it.  I can't wait for the third DVD.",1235692800,,530,4.24

WHAT WE SAW ON THIS DVD WAS ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENT THAN THE SHOWS YOU SEE ON TV. THE MONEY SPENT ON THIS CHRISTMAS PRESENT WAS NOT WORTH THE HASSLE.

JUDGE JUDY IS AWESOME AND WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GET SOME REAL ACTION IN THIS DVD ""JUDGE JUDY-SECOND TO NONE"" - BUT WE DIDN'T.",1231891200,,424,4.2875
3474328,5,B001AYXDC2,I love Judge Judy and  I can't believe the ridiculous things people sue each other for. I had to search for this video and amazon had it. If you love Judge Judy and her wit this is perfect. You get to see 10-12 cases that are sometimes very silly. Judy deals with litigants fairly. If your a fan of the show and just enjoy watching some of her most unusual cases this is a must.,1231632000,,378,4.04
3474329,4,B001AYXDC2,"Had to have this DVD for my library.  Pretty good stuff, but I love me some Judge Judy anyway!  She's really nicer than her critics give her credit for; she just is not the one for foolishness.",1229990400,,193,4.1891891891891895

3474331,3,B001AYXDC2,I love watching Judge Judy and her put downs.  She cracks me up.  I was a bit disappointed watching this DVD.  I felt some of her best shows weren't featured.  I enjoyed watching it but this isn't something I'm in a hurry to watch again.,1229040000,,237,4.2
3474332,5,B001AYXDC2,Just like on tv Judge Judy is in her prime.  Extremely fast shipping bot the dvd before my debit account was charged.  Good Job Amazon.com  I am always happy with the everything I order from Amazon,1229040000,2,197,4.416666666666667

3474334,3,B001AYXDC2,If you don't have time to watch Judge Judy on TV this is for you.  Four cases from the syndicated TV show with a short introduction of each case by Judge judy and participants comments after the segment.

By the way I love that Judge Judy gives a little talk before each case. Excellent",1226361600,5,260,3.8867924528301887

3474342,4,B001AYXDC2,"I have been watching Judge Judy now for 12 years. The truth of the matter is she only gets better. With all her years on this show, I'm still amazed how some of the same things keep coming up in her courtroom. Especially the cases where women allow a man for whom she is only dating to borrow money. The best part is that I am a man. I hope she stays with us for 12 or more years to come. I also keep hoping we will see her show come to full DVD release as a season.

Keep up the great work.. A true hero JUDGE JUDY...",1223856000,,518,3.7962962962962963
