2857668,5,B000R349JI,"I have been a fan of Miss Marple ever since the wonderful Joan Hickson portrayed her in BBC's production of Miss Marple in the 1980's.  While I will always love the BBC productions, Geraldine McEwan has brought a more modern, stylized Jane Marple to PBS.  She breathes new life into an almost stuffy character, and it, in my opinion, makes her seem more human and down to earth than Joan Hickson's Miss Marple.

I also love to see today's British actors in these new productions.  Who can go wrong with guest stars like Timothy Dalton, John Hannah, Juliet Stevenson, Greg Wise, and Mark Heap, just to name a few.  This series showcases some of the greatest talent Britain has to offer.  The sets are wonderful, the costumes beautiful, and the attention to detail is unmatched.

While Marple purists will critisize that the stories deviate from the original writings of Agatha Christie, sometimes it is allowed, even encouraged, to go a different direction when prior productions have stuck with the book.  There are always going to be people that are unhappy because it the story isn't followed verbatim, but an artistic license is allowed.  It makes the story interesting, especially if the person watching thinks they know in advance how the story is going to unfold.  There are twists and turns in the plot that keep everyone guessing.

All in all, it is a wonderful series.  I highly recommend it for anyone who likes to enjoy a good murder mystery.  The acting is top notch, and the stories never seem to age.  And, they will keep you guessing from beginning to end.",1188086400,17,1571,4.749077490774908
2857669,1,B000R349JI,"Call me a ""Purist,"" if you want, but this series doesn't even come close to Agatha Christie's wonderful spinster sleuth.  Christie's intricate plots, complicated and multi-dimensional characters, red herrings and surprising endings have all been changed.  With this ""New"" series we have foolish and unintentionally comical scripts, shallow characters, and some of the silliest plot twists since Peter Sellers did the Pink Panther.  There's very little of Christie's books here except for the titles, the names of a few characters and Miss Marple of course.  Everything else has been changed to suit a newer market, whatever that may be.  My biggest criticism is for Bertram's Hotel, where Miss Marple is literally sidelined for the Hotel Maid.  Yes, the creators have made Miss Marple so dithering, twittering, twinkling and feeble that the Hotel Maid has to do the sleuthing and summing up of the crime.  Agatha Christie would turn in her grave!!

BERTRAM'S HOTEL:  The creators of this series changed Bertram's Hotel from the classy and Edwardian style hotel with older clientele and elaborate teas to a loud and garish three-ring circus.  It opens with Miss Marple walking in and looking like a homeless waif.  There's a group of screaming young twits running to see....are you ready for this???.....Louie Armstrong!!! Bess Sedgwick has been changed from a classy, thrill-seeker and absentee mother to a dumpy, depressed looking drudge.  She's also been made a secondary character.  Of Course in keeping with the inane changes of Christie's writing, there's a Nazi spin just to keep things repetitive and boring.  There's also one of the silliest and unbelievable shootouts in the streets of London no less.  Cartoonish characters of a hat designer who looks like a 1700's style French clown and a loud Jazz Singer have just been thrown in to be the new red herrings.  This is the worst of the lot, strictly because they push Miss Marple to the sidelines.  Geraldine McEwan doesn't have a chance to show her real acting abilities.  Miss Marple is the real victim here.  Bumped off by an annoying Hotel Maid.

NEMESIS:  Again more incomprehensible plot and character changes make Christie's real ""Nemesis"" unrecognizable from this mess.  Too bad some of us actually know what great plots Christie wrote because they don't exist here.  More recognizable actors have been placed in each episode to make us forget that the real plot doesn't exist.  Richard Grant is wasted and given the inenviable role of a foolish womanizer.  Again with the German Nazi plot twist added where it never existed in Christie's plot.  The three sisters who are essential to the plot have been changed to Nuns in the Catholic Church.  The ending is comical.  Too bad Peter Sellers is dead.  He would be great in this one.

TOWARDS ZERO and ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE:  Miss marple never appeared in Christie's wonderful mysteries by these titles, but since when has that stopped this untalented crew?  They just plopped her in anywhere.  That's okay since there's no plotting or characters of note.  Just a lot of scenery chewing by more recognizable actors.  Since I've seen most of them in other British productions I know they're worthy of better acting.  Unfortunately not here because their main function is to do a lot of eye popping.  Jane Seymour and Greg Wise literally do that.  It's a waste of their talent.

These productions remind me of little community plays put on by amatuers.  They're loud, garish and sadly lacking in any quality.  For those of us who know and love AGATHA CHRISTIE'S real Miss Marple this is a major diappointment indeed.

If you want to enjoy this series, don't open an Agatha Christie book.  Also, Keep your expectations low.  Do these things and I can assure you that you will not be disappointed.",1187654400,41,3808,4.985691573926868
2857670,5,B000R349JI,"I just watched the last movie last night PBS Mystery Sunday.  Every single one is just excellent, the plot, climate and acting was so enjoyable. I have them saved on my DVR, but the series is so good will buy as soon as it becomes available.",1187654400,8,241,4.239130434782608
2857671,2,B000R349JI,"Now, I have to say right off, that, even though I appreciated Geraldine McEwen's portrayal much more, the scriptwriters had her saying the most hilariously inane things--unfortunately the viewer is tempted to laugh in all the wrong places, despite her excellent performance. No one on the production staff seemed the least bit concerned with historical or literary accuracy. It makes you sigh for what could have been.

Also ironic is the appearance of perhaps an anti-clergy slant, since Miss Marple was the daughter of an Anglican vicar. Earlier we saw at least one  alcoholic rector, and now we have presented to us a), a society matron in the book Nemesis changed into a murderously obsessed nun for television; and b), a character changed from the kind, gentle Canon Pennyfather in the novel of At Bertram's Hotel to a crazed Nazi war criminal masquerading as an Anglican priest.

Nor is the QUIET, efficiently run establishment of understated elegance in the novel anywhere to be seen; it is a place of utter chaos invaded by an American jazz band (which Miss Marple seems to relish; she's almost snapping her finger to the beat--""Yeah man""). Yikes! By changing and inventing all the characters for the TV series while keeping some basic thread of the original plot, the viewer gets the worst of both worlds: Everything but the ending is now a surprise.

Which brings us to the most hilarious bit of all: In Bertram's Hotel, when Miss Marple asks Jane, the chambermaid, if she and the chief inspector are going to get married after discovering romance, the young woman says, ""Oh no, we're just going to live together; that's how it's done these days"" (remember, this is 1952); and even more roll-on-the-floor funny is Miss Marple's reply: ""That's not what I would have done at your age, but I probably would now.""

Oh yes. Little ladylike Miss Marple shacking up with the (not even very handsome) chief inspector. Good lord--where will the scriptwriters go from there? That's the REAL mystery.",1186963200,136,1999,4.919881305637982

Not only is she fantastic, the supporting cast is also superb. But what I enjoyed most was the outstanding Screenwriting for all episodes. For the ""purest"" out there you are going to be a little disappointed, but for the others this was a fresh take on all Miss Marple stories but yet maintained the Christie ""touch."" The villain remained the villain and the lovers the lovers but there was a fresh and slightly different take on each of the plots. And it was done SO WELL that I actually looked forward to watching another episode to see what quirks and changes had been made.

The McEwan Nemesis is visually appealing, well produced and well acted, but why did the writers make such drastic changes to the plot and characters of a wonderful original?  This lifts some of Christie's characters and some plot elements, to me yielding a parody of Christie's work, of which Nemesis is my favorite.  The Hickson productions are all five-star; this McEwan belongs with the Margaret Rutherford comedies (which do work as comedies).

2857855,1,B000R349JI,"Nemesis was a great read.  Miss Marple was ALONE in her search for the truth, unaccompanied by a playboy nephew, and her uncertainty about her position and mission is central to the theme.  That, plus her problems with age.  The TV version distorts the entire story, giving Geraldine McCewan a much safer place to be and making her so sparky we barely think of her as an elderly lady.  Agatha Christie was interested in crime but her greatest interest -- and the basis for her unprecedented success in the genre -- was people: what makes them tick; why they do what they do.  In the book, we are drawn into her reveries and musings about different characters.  But the directors of the TV series ignore this element almost entirely, relying instead on crude and obvious plot devices to keep interest alive, treating the audience as if it had the attention span of a five year old.  They also cheat us out of the exquisite sense of civility that acts as a counterpoint to the evil -- the teas by the fireside, the carefully tended gardens, and the attention to an orderly and structured personal life rooted in the British soul and the matrix of Ms. Christie's creative world.  We are left with a mostly unrecognizable who-done-it with the original color washed away.",1436400000,5,1266,4.671171171171171

2857919,5,B000R349JI,"This set of 4 episodes detaches a bit from earlier season's insertions of early 21st century sensibilities in period pieces written before the 21st century. The mysteries follow that predictable Agatha Christie pattern--everyone has reasons to be suspected, and there are other plots afoot beside the murder. Just when things seem unresolvable another murder (or two) occurs, and thanks to Jane Marple's attention to detail with perhaps a few allies making a contribution, you realize that some little detail you could ostensibly have noticed yourself directs attention to the true, but heretofore unlikely killer. It would be cheating to figure out who you think did it by measuring each character against this formula, wouldn't it? Or would it...you are responsible for your own choices, no matter how poorly they work out. The only certainty--Jane Marple herself will survive until the denouement.",1406246400,,900,5.390070921985815
2857920,5,B000R349JI,Geraldine McEwan is the ultimate Miss Marple. She brings a great deal to the role. You can see her sitting quietly in the background taking everything in with a twinkle in her eye. I only wish she had done more episodes.,1406160000,,220,4.390243902439025
2857921,2,B000R349JI,"A strong lesbian theme is very much in evidence in too many of the episodes.

2857931,5,B000R349JI,My grand daughter and I had an Agatha Christie marathon during the 4th of July holiday.  We watched 7 episodes of Ms. Marple's seasons 2 and 3.  Needless to say we had a blast.  We tried our best to discover the murderer before the end of each episode.  I am happy to say that between the two of us we got 4 out of 7 correct.  It was so much fun and the episodes were full of suspense.,1404777600,,385,3.8846153846153846

2857933,4,B000R349JI,"Who knew the heart was so black in these small hamlets? Marple sees everything and winnows it out with great subtlety and gentle understanding. There is never a chance that anyone will see her as a threat until it is too late. Often the culprit has logical & tragic - if twisted - reasons for what they have done. The supporting cast works like an ensemble crew though the characters change from episode to episode. The lovely settings lull you until the inevitable body is discovered. Like Jessica Fletcher in Murder She Wrote, you have to wonder if anyone hesitates to ask Miss Marple to visit since murder follows her everywhere",1404086400,,631,4.693693693693693
2857934,5,B000R349JI,She is so very good in this and just is Miss Marple. Three seasons is not enough of McEwan in this role.,1403308800,,104,3.772727272727273

Nemesis was my favorite from this season - lots of twists and turns, all somehow intertwined.

But if you do then you will find 'most' of them are very good.  The Sittaford Mystery is not one that makes the grade but then many Christie fans don't think much of the original.  Not all she wrote qualify as classics.  Even Shakespeare had his duds.  But keep an open mind and you will find some very good 'New' Miss Marple's. Same goes with the Poirot's.  Some of those with Suche are so,so.  Most are great. Oh, ""By the Pricking of my Thumbs"" Has no business with Miss Marple in it and the Tuppence character is a real travesty.",1400198400,,676,4.275590551181103

Balanced proportion of mystery, chills, entertainment, and humor.  Not too dark or too fluffy. Enough clues are given that you could figure out whodunit but challenging enough that I rarely get it wholly right and sometimes I am completely off. Well paced and creative, but not preposterous.",1399248000,,413,4.956521739130435

Thankfully, this faux pas was not part of Miss Marple's character, and it added nothing to the plot line.  McEwan is my favorite of the Marple actresses and she left the series after this season and she is always worth watching.

Other people have complained there is an anti-religion theme in the movies and yes I would agree allot of the bad characters have religious back grounds.  But I have not heard anyone complain about the anti-gay theme in the movies.  Where at least two of the movies the killers were Lesbian Lovers!

Over all I like Mrs. McEwan portrayal and the scenes in the movies are first rate.  But as I said before Periot is a better series by far.",1390089600,,663,4.466666666666667

HOW MANY OF YOU GRIPERS LIVED IN AGATHA CHRISTIE'S DAY???  Did any of you grow up in in the 1950's???  You would not have liked the hatefullness of that time.  There was a time when males and females had to learn about being in love actually by getting married and living a married life.  In my own day as a young girl and lady, people only whispered about forbidden things and if you spoke out loud about sex, there were all those ""why I'd never do such a nasty thing or say it or ask about"" and these people may even had been married forty years.

SO, CHECK OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THE NORM FOR LIFE AND WHAT WAS SAID DONE ALOUD BEFORE YOU START RAGING ABOUT THE STUFFINESS.  I am 71 years old and I never carried on with being high and mighty and never will.

Yes, once again, more liberties have been taken with these famous books.  It would be nice, but I never expect filmmakers to stay faithful to the stories they're adapting from much better source material.  The appeal of putting their own spin on things is just too great a temptation.  Then too, I suppose they're afraid of dealing with something so familiar, trying to present it in a way that it seems fresh, new.  They can't help but damage the goods in their haste to make money off of someone else's talent.  If I were truly jaded, I'd say it was more about the money, less about the art involved.

2858075,5,B000R349JI,As usual her work is full of suspense.  The actress who plays Ms. Marple is great.  With her facial expressions she brings you to different conclusions and back.  This series bring at least one minor suspense with the larger suspense.  So sit back and enjoy.  This is all done without bad languages and sex scenes.,1374710400,2,314,4.636363636363637

2858078,3,B000R349JI,They seem to have gotten it together finally. Not as good as some interpretations but worth watching. Geraldine McEwan has started to get her feet under her and the writing is adjusting to her acting style.,1373846400,,206,4.75
2858079,5,B000R349JI,I own this series because of GM and her Marple is sublime and well paced. More doddering and which makes her seem more plausible as the Old Lady they should ignore. I love the ones with Julie Mckenzie as well. She is a very fine actor but for some reason these are so very dear to my heart I watch them over and over again and they calm down. Who every thought MURDER would lulls me to sleep....,1373846400,2,395,4.076923076923077

2858107,5,B000R349JI,"What can I say about this series, that hasn't been expressed already? Only that, in my opinion, this actress is by far the most finely nuanced, witty and intelligent of all Marples. I loved watching Geraldine McEwan as Lucia. Here she is, transformed.  My only criticism...and it's a small one...is that the accompanying music is distracting in the extreme. But oh! what a stylish, lovely way to spend an evening, curled up on the sofa with the incomparable Jane Marple.",1365811200,2,470,4.875

2858130,1,B000R349JI,"Unfortunately these rewrites of Christie classics are anything but ""true to the spirit"" of Agatha Christie.  She must be spinning in her grave with indignation over these travesties.

Characters are dropped, others are made up and inserted for little or no reason.  Teenage characters (13 and 16 years old, main characters in different stories) are portrayed as being older than the same character in the novels and far more sophisticated (if you equate a certain type of sexuality with ""sophistication"").

All the older characters drop a full generation, so that middle-aged characters are now twenty-somethings and elderly characters are now merely middle aged.  EVERYBODY is far better looking than in real life OR the novels.  Culprits are changed and the sexuality of main characters is modified.  ""Romantic"" themes that were not present in the original stories, usually involving main characters that were invented solely for these TV episodes, are inserted for little or no reason, and add not a thing to the main story line.

As for Geraldine McEwan being the ultimate Marple, sorry, but she's not.  This ""Marple"" bears little resemblance to the Jane Marple of the books.  There is nowhere near enough of the wry humor of the original, nor of the air of genteel poverty that Miss Marple lives in, as is clear throughout the original Christie tales.  She has an ""income"" but it is not sufficient to keep her in true comfort; hence she trains young girls who want to ""go into service"" for that little bit of extra income and/or in exchange for their services while they are in training, and in her declining years she is largely supported by her nephew.

In particular, Miss Marple wouldn't have been caught dead dressing like a dowdy charwoman, which is what the wardrobe choices for her in these episodes make her look like.

Main characters are relegated to becoming bit parts, disappear altogether, or are warped into totally unrecognizable caricatures of stereotypical types that bear absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the originals; in one case, the original character of a bumbling country priest is transmogrified into a snarling raving Nazi.  The character isn't the only thing about that story that's insane; whoever mangled these stories for the sake of ""modernizing"" the scripts ought to be stood up against a wall somewhere and summarily shot.

These stories have not been improved by any stretch of the imagination.  Instead, they've been mangled into near unrecognizability, with Christie's witty, gentle, loving character studies being replaced by prurient sensationalist ""plots"" that are about as subtle as the blunt object the murder victim gets clubbed with.

Don't confuse these travesties with the fine productions staring Joan Hickson.  She didn't quite capture all of Miss Marple's character - she's just a tad bit too severe - but she at least rang true to the era and the character, even if incompletely.  She just didn't have the ""birdlike"" quality Miss Marple of the novels has, but she hit almost every other Marple note dead on.  The wry wit, the gentle but inexorable sharpness of her intellect, her masterful and largely non-judgmental grasp of the vagaries of human existence; Joan Hickson got those all dead on.  Of course she was undoubtedly helped no end in her portrayal by being given scripts that are as true to the original novels as possible. Miss Marple fits into that world as created by Christie for her.  Change that, and the Miss Marple you get is something wholly different and entirely (in these cases) unsatisfactory.",1349913600,12,3577,5.068259385665529
2858131,4,B000R349JI,"One of Agatha Christies strenths is her interesting and diverse characters, watching more realistic crime drama can be depressing Agatha Christie is definately an escape from the dullness of life not that my life is dull.

Yes, the actors are good, the locales picturesque and well-chosen, the costuming well-done. The sound, however, is poor enough to make it difficult in places to follow the dialogue, and many episodes are lacking CC. Personally, I like a film to be a little bit more than ""very loosely based"" on a story. It's more like they tried to draw from the Agatha Christie fan base to find an audience. Sorry, the original stories were good enough to span generations. The draw of watching stories set in a different era is the nostalgia as much as anything. Throwing in modern-day morals (or lack thereof) just for titillation's sake is an unwelcome distraction.

I find Geraldine Mcewans interpretation of Miss Marple more ""human"" than Hickson's.  The productions are well staged, the sets very well done, and the musical background sensational.  Of course there are deviations from the books - not as much as Margaret Rutherford's ""tongue-in-cheek"" portrayals.  These should be enjoyed for what they are - ""adapted from Agatha Christie novels"".  A pleasant change from Joan Hickson's stuffy, unbending portrayals!

Murder at the Vicarage - gave us a look into Miss Marple's early years.  I found this not only endearing, but gave a better understanding of her character.

I have all three series and thoroughly enjoy replaying them often.  I only hope a series four will be forthcoming.

The sexual side is still there for discerning viewers but no so in-your-face as the earlier series. Of course the scripts have suffered considerable re-writes but are generally still recognizable.

2858144,4,B000R349JI,"Geraldine McEwan IS the definitive Miss Marple -- AGATHA CHRISTIE'S vision of Miss Marple. She's not necessarily the ""best"" Miss Marple we've ever seen. I believe that this award must go to Margaret Rutherford in this series:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Agatha-Christie-Miss-Marple-Movie-Collection-Murder-at-the-Gallop-Murder-Ahoy-Murder-Most-Foul-Murder-She-Said/dp/B000CRR374/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Agatha Christie Miss Marple Movie Collection (Murder at the Gallop / Murder Ahoy / Murder Most Foul / Murder She Said)</a>

Of course, Margaret Rutherford was nothing like the Marple of whom Christie wrote so fondly -- but her performance in those four excellent and timeless black-and-white films was nothing short of superb.

But we cannot allow mediocre screenwriting to take away from Geraldine McEwan's fine performance in this series. While her acting was brilliant, the films had an '80s feel about them and many of the various scenes seemed contrived. Yes, these are cozy murders so we expect a little tongue-and-cheekness but I think that better direction could have yielded an outstanding product. The star talent was clearly available.

I am commenting on 3 of the 4 of this series that I've seen so far, including ""Nemesis,"" ""Towards Zero,"" and, ""At Bertram's Hotel,"" (but not
""Ordeal by Innocence,"" which I have yet to view). By the way, there is an incredible Donald Sutherland ""noir-version"" of ""Ordeal by Innocence"" if you have yet to hear of it:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ordeal-by-Innocence-Exclusive/dp/B000059ZXN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ordeal by Innocence ([...] Exclusive)</a>

""Nemesis"" is sort of jumbled and over-dramatized, story-wise. It's all about Miss Marple solving an old murder (and a new one) during a bus tour of the English countryside. As a consequence of this, you can expect some spectacular cinematography which saves the film.

In ""Towards Zero,"" the story gains coherence as it goes along but it lacks substance. It's as if the actors were ""puting out product"". I think that the Director must have kept them on too tight a leash. I was THRILLED to get to see a much aged, but still great, Tom Baker (of ""Doctor Who"" fame!) playing the victim in this one.

""At Bertram's Hotel"" is a huge stretch from Christie's superb original story. If that's what you're expecting you'll be disappointed because the producers fleshed out about 60 percent of it. Consequentially, the screenplay is limited to murder at (near) the hotel and that's about it. Most of the original international intrigue and swarthy characters have been nullified. Again, it's okay, but it could have been outstanding.

I wondered after watching these films why the producers and casting directors went to all the effort to grab the perfect Miss Marple and then, with barrels of red ink and abounding artistic license, ditzed the original Christie stories. It's a puzzle to me.

The quality of these DVDs is excellent and the scenes are well-done in terms of costumes and set artifacts. If you're a big Christie fan, definitely watch these. If you're a broader-market cozy murder fan, you can still watch with interest. More casual movie enthusiasts will probably yawn quite a bit during viewings of these films.",1201219200,4,3323,5.64128256513026

2858151,2,B000R349JI,"Great liberty has been taken in drastically rewriting the plots of the original novels.  The only thing these dramatizations have in common with the original novels is the names of a few characters and a weak link with what happened.  The problem being that Christie was probably the best writer of coherent plots with no flaws and the script writer is not up to that standard.  The plots seem to be a jumble of activity that does not fit together.

The characters are now lower class compared to the characters in the novels.  As an example, Bertram's hotel (which originally had only upper class customers) is now populated with lower class people wearing expensive clothes who are so socially unskilled that they cannot walk across a room without bumping into a few dozen other people.

The only two good thing I can say about this set of dramatizations is that none of the actresses wear heavily padded bras as did the actresses in the first two sets.  In fact the few actress that are above average in fullness dresses to tone it down.  Also, there is no woman to woman romantic-physical affection as occurred in the first two sets.

One of the program plots relies on a convent of Catholic nuns allowing a novice to wear secular jewelry. Either the script writers were disconnected from reality or they thought the audience would be.",1193270400,28,1339,4.71244635193133

I'm no worshipper of the old Hickson series and would have been happy to see new versions, but these new ones are just dumbed-down and insulting to Christie.  Some of the newer Poirots have been quite good, but even with sexing up most of them have remained sufficiently true to the text (a major exception being the egregious Cards on the Table adaptation).  The Marples, on the other hand, have just been one disaster after another, beginning with the ongoing destruction of Miss Marple's character.  Whoever the woman is in these films she is not Miss Marple.  Christie's grandson should be ashamed of himself for allowing this to continue.  But, that aside, the adaptations just aren't very good.  Nemesis and Bertram's Hotel are by no means perfect books, but the changes in the films make them look idiotic.  They just seem to be doing changes for the sake of making changes at this point.  With the others, I find introducing Miss Marple into books where she does not belong upsets the structure.  But obviously the adaptors don't care about such things.  Awful.",1193011200,65,1199,4.8
2858153,2,B000R349JI,"Ever since season 1, I have enjoyed the cinematography of this new Jane Marple series, and the production design. The colors are eye-popping, the costumes over-the-top, the acting arch and stylized (I wonder if Ken Russell, who had a key role in an episode of Season 1, had anything to do with that). I bought Season 2 and 3 as soon as they came out on DVD, and I have to say that Season 3 has turned out to be a laughable disappointment.

The production values are still here, the series continues to provide an extra paycheck for unemployed British acting greats, but the writing has wandered away from the Christie novels and ended up in a soap opera somewhere. The dialogue is stilted and unbelievable, Miss Marple behaves more and more out of character, and the plots are changed out of all recognition, and not for the better.

In some misguided attempt to make the stories more ""modern"" and ""interesting,"" the writers dream up the most ludicrous stereotyped characters - murderous nuns (yes, there's a nasty anti-religious theme through this Season), Nazis on the lam, drunken novelists, an oily-haired gigolo - and have them commit bizarre actions, such as switch bodies so that characters thought to be dead aren't really dead at all, or commit suicide with a piece of statuary. Or better yet, stage a shootout in olde London town! If it weren't so disappointing, it would be funny.

I've read a lot of negative reviews of these new adaptations, and from what I can gather, most were written by people who really love the old Joan Hickson series from the 1980s. Personally, I never really enjoyed those. Joan Hickson was too aloof, and the adaptations were very dour and lacked the humor of the novels. These adaptations, on the other hand, are great fun. They have a slick and glossy look to them, the costumes and sets are exquisite, and the performances are great. All the actors look as if they're having a great time, which is always fun to see.

A lot of people also complain about the plot changes to the novels, which admittedly are more prevalent in this series than in the first two. However, the Joan Hickson series already made 12 ultra-faithful adaptations - why take that route again? I find that, for the most part, the liberties taken with the original plots pay off. As much as I love the original books, they weren't perfect, and often these new changes alter aspects of the books that I disliked. For instance, I always found ""Nemesis"" to be one of Christie's weakest Miss Marple books, and I frankly preferred this new (albeit very radical) adaptation.

The only reason I hesitate to give this series 5 stars is ""Ordeal By Innocence"" - the fourth episode of the series. It was never one of my favourite Christie books, and even though the adaptation made some changes, I found it curiously flat and unengaging. Jane Seymour really sinks her teeth into the malicious queen-bee role, but for the most part I found the story boring and silly. Aside from that, all the episode were very good (especially ""Nemesis"" and ""At Bertram's Hotel""). As in the first 2 series, Geraldine McEwan is the perfect Miss Marple - sly, intelligent, and always 2 steps ahead of everyone else.

If you enjoyed the first 2 series, or even if you just enjoy mystery series in general, I really recommend the new Miss Marple. Enjoy!",1191888000,7,2173,4.607235142118863

2858159,4,B000R349JI,"""Agatha Christie's Marple"" has hit its stride in the third season. Labyrinthine plots and memorable characterizations offer more meaty melodrama than previous seasons. The series is no longer bland or cursory. And I am getting used to Geraldine McEwan's scruffy, irritating characterization of Miss Marple. Actually, Miss Marple is a co-investigator in ""At Bertram's Hotel"" and leaves most of the snooping to others in ""Ordeal by Innocence"", placing the substance of the films in the hands of fine supporting casts. ""Towards Zero"" and ""Ordeal by Innocence"" were not, in fact, Miss Marple books. The series seems to have found the right balance of histrionics and period ambiance for maximum entertainment value. I enjoyed this more than previous seasons, and I encourage anyone who didn't like the ""new"" Miss Marple to give Series 3 a try. These are the mysteries:

""Towards Zero"" refers to the idea that the circumstances of murder develop over years and converge at a zero hour. In this case, Lady Camilla Tressilian's (Eileen Atkins) family converge on her estate for holiday. Among them are her tennis pro nephew Neville (Greg Wise), his first wife Audrey (Saffron Burrows), his current wife Kay (Zoe Tapper), Kay's playboy friend Teddy Latimer (Paul Nicholls), lawyer Freddy Treves (Tom Baker), and Miss Marple, who knew Lady Camilla in their school days. Mr. Treves tells a peculiar story one evening about a child who got away with murder by claiming the gruesome death of his brother was an accident. Treves suffers a fatal heart attack later that night. When Camilla is bludgeoned to death in her bed, it's clear that something wicked is afoot. The crotchety, overbearing Lady Tressilian lends this mystery some welcome bite.

It's 1951 in ""Nemesis"", and Miss Marple's dear old friend, German expatriate Jason Rafiel, has died and left her a record imploring her to investigate ""a terrible crime"" along with 2 tickets to a coach tour for herself and a trusted companion. She asks her novelist nephew Raymond West (Richard E. Grant) to join her, and off they are on a Daffodil mystery tour, accompanied by energetic tour guide Georgina (Ruth Wilson) and 10 other people who also received invitations from an anonymous benefactor. As the tour progresses from the palatial estate Forrester Grange to a convent, it becomes apparent that the tour guests are all connected is some way to a young woman named Verity (Laura-Michelle Kelly) who disappeared 11 years before as she was about to elope with a German pilot during the War.

Miss Marple finds that little ahs changed since her childhood ""At Bertram's Hotel"". She is there to see a friend, Selina (Francesca Annis), the third cousin of missing, presumed dead, tycoon Sir Richard Blake. Blake's adventuress wife Bess (Polly Walker) and their estranged daughter Elvira (Emily Beecham) have also come for the will reading. When a maid is found strangled on the hotel's roof, Inspector Bird (Stephen Mangan) of Scotland Yard investigates. Miss Marple enlists the help of enterprising maid Jane (Martine McCutcheon) to unravel the mystery of murder, threats on Bess' life, a snap-happy hat designer, a Eastern European race car driver, and artwork on the hotel's walls that looks surprisingly authentic. The humor and the stylized, almost whimsical atmosphere that permeates this mystery is a nice change of tone.

In ""Ordeal by Innocence"", Miss Marple is delighted to be invited to the wedding of Gwenda Vaughn (Juliet Stevenson) to whom she had been a mentor when Gwenda was an orphaned young woman in service. Gwenda is engaged to Leo Argyle (Denis Lawson), a widowed writer for whom she worked as a secretary. Leo's domineering, wealthy wife Rachel (Jane Seymour) was murdered 2 years before, shortly after refusing to pay their son Jacko's (Burn Gorman) gambling debts. With both Rachel and Jacko, who was executed for the crime, out of the picture, the family found relative peace. Now Leo, Gwenda, the 4 remaining children, and Miss Marple cheerfully gather in anticipation of the wedding. But Dr. Calgary (Julian Rhind Tutt) interrupts their evening with shocking news: Jacko had an alibi for the time of his mother's murder.",1188432000,22,4188,5.100583090379009

It was also great to see Eileen  Aikens and Juliet Stevenson perform. Unfortunately, a talented  cast does not always make for a great series. One needs good writers, when adapting novels for the small screen. It is in the writing department where this series is seriously lacking.

The  first episode of season three is the most tolerable one, as it stays reasonably close in plot to the book, despite some character changes and adding Miss Marple to the mix, who was not a part of the novel. Episode 2  was based on a Miss Jane Marple mystery but here the plot was changed to an almost incomprehensible mish mash. Episode three was also based upon a Miss Marple novel and better than episode two,  but that is not saying much. It was still not great, as here again, the plot was changed significantly into some sort of ridiculous hodge podge. It is also supposed to be a period piece, but lacks total authenticity of time and place due to the interjection of current social mores by the writers, who seem to be totally  clueless. As for episode four, which again is based one a novel that did not feature Miss Marple, Miss Marple is written into the script along with some, surprise, surprise, plot changes. Why don't the writer realise, if it ain't broke, don't fix it?

Now, I realize that novels often need some changes, when being adapted for the screen, but these wholesale writing  changes have not been for the better. Why take something tried and true, and make changes that are often incomprehensible or implausible. Moreover, if you are doing them as the period pieces they now are, why interject current social mores into the mix, which only serves to kill off any authenticity of time and place one may be trying to project. This is why Dame Agatha Christie is a legend, and these writers are not. They simply lack talent, something Dame Christie had in abundance.

Purists will hate this series, while others may love it. I fall  somewhere in the middle. Like a moth to the flame, I am drawn to the series, if only out of curiosity as to how the works of Dame Agatha  Christie will be butchered again by these talentless writing hacks. So, I will be viewing season four, if only to check out the new Jane Marple, played by Julia McKenzie, who is taking over the role, as Geraldine McEwan is retiring.",1490572800,,2459,4.614678899082569
