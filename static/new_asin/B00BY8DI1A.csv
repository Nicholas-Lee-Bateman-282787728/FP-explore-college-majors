Needs a Geoff laugh montage too.",1516060800,,168,4.6
8575506,4,B00BY8DI1A,"Really funny, witty, and intriguing. However it's only funny the first couple times, then you know what to expect and gets old. But if you like Halo, and RT, I suggest it.",1438646400,,171,4.375
8575507,5,B00BY8DI1A,One of the funniest collections I've ever gotten. My girlfriend hates halo and even she was laughing!,1426723200,,101,5.0

8575509,5,B00BY8DI1A,This is another good Rooster Teeth from a non-Rooster Teeth fan BUT I will do anything to bond with my teen and he loves these guys!! I should probably buy a second copy because I'm afraid he's going to wear the vids out!,1388016000,,221,4.162790697674419
8575510,5,B00BY8DI1A,"This review mostly serves to be informational so you know what you're buying. All I'm gonna say besides that is that I showed it to my dad and step mom who know nothing about Halo, and they enjoyed every second of it.

The DVD comes with 2 commentaries: One with Jack and Geoff at the time the episodes were made, and another more recent one with other RoosterTeeth members. Also included are some episodes of Achievement Hunter Life.
