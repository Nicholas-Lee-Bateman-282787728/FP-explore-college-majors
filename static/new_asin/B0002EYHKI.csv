2083495,1,B0002EYHKI,"Saw this with my buddy.  He told me about a couple of reviews out here praising it to the sky.  The only people who could like this film are either homesick Philippinos (for the scenes back home in the first half) or a shill who works for the DVD's distribution company.  Notice the last review, trying to pretend the movie is good fiction.  It stinks.  It has zero entertainment value.  You'd enjoy a visit to the dentist more.  And whatever art-house pretensions shills may try to give it, it lacks.  The main Philippino characters are good in this movie's terms of Philippino clan morality and have nothing to learn, so they display zero character development.  On the other hand the American loser is not speaking with his family, so he deserves to be humiliated.  At length.  This includes things like ""sizing him up,"" as when one Philippino asks the other, ""how big is his ####?""  You're supposed to sit through all his degradation to learn that a dirt-poor slob with everything stacked against him can't buy happiness?  How ""thought provoking.""  Who would've known?  To echo an earlier review, why do I have to give this movie even one star?",1104192000,14,1148,4.698492462311558
2083496,5,B0002EYHKI,"I received Closer To Home from my brother who knows I'm a big movie fan. Whata pleasant surprise to see such a good film that I had never heard of. I logged on here to help spread the word and was surprised to see half the people here LOVED it and half HATED it!

 I actually watched it again to see what I missed before writing this. I liked it even more the second time so I reread the reviews to see what they missed. They apparently missed quite a bit.

The guy who goes on and on about visa law seems to have a problem distinguishing reality and fiction. I get the distinct impression that he's in the middle of arranging his own Asian wedding and freaked out at the suggestion that they don't always work out. As far as immigration laws, did you consider that she got her visa from a guy in a go-go bar? I think it might be safe to assume that some legalities may have been bent,and therefore, as it was suggested by another reviewer, it's irrelevant to this story of FICTION.

The fellow who asks what is the point of watching a poor soul have his dreams crushed at every turn, there is a point.

The point is that you can't buy happiness. This is a story about a person who embraces the idea of family and a person who rejects the concept.

The Filipina girl will go to great lenghts to help her family but the American treats his family with total contempt and disregard. You can't treat your own family that way and expect to buy happiness out of a catalog.

For this movie to end with them working out their differences and being happy together, would have made this serious,thought provoking movie into a fairytale.

The people who liked this movie simply reviewed a work of fiction, the people who hated it seemed to take it personally. I would actually give this beautiful movie a rating of four but gave it a five to compensate for the unwarrented and misleading comments in some of the negative reviews.",1104019200,9,1919,4.355742296918767
2083497,1,B0002EYHKI,"What a malicious, vicious movie.  It revels in crushing and demeaning some poor, lonely misfit who reaches out for love in the only way he knows how.  The filmmakers take sadistic joy in endlessly drawing out this character's downfall.  I kept watching till the end thinking things would turn around.  They never did.  I can't recall when I hated a movie so much.  What is the point of this movie and watching some poor character endlessly lose?  Do yourself a favor and save your money and your time for something that won't anger you.  This movie made me so angry I was compelled to write this review.  Why do I even have to give this movie one star?",1103500800,22,652,4.4576271186440675
2083498,4,B0002EYHKI,"""Closer To Home"" is a story about two people from two different cultures whose coming together comes about from following two completely different paths. Dalisay is a young Filipina from a poor but loving family who will do anything to help her family. Anything, that is, except sacrifice her morals or integrity. She agrees to leave her home and all she loves to help save her sister and her financially troubled family.(The review below from M. Brady beautifully describes how well the movie captures life of the poor in the provinces)

  Dean is an American from a quite dysfunctional family who doesn't have the first idea of how to be in a relationship. He arranges to bring Dalisay to America to be his wife but everything must be on his terms. His concept of a happy family is incomplete because he never experienced it himself. He's not a bad person, just unprepared to deal with a real relationship which must include compromise and understanding. I ended up feeling sorry for him.

 Of course, the different cultures, different goals and different family experiences leads to difficulty in their relationship.

  The two reviews from DGreen and Anonymous try to blame Dalisay for the problems but they seem to have completely missed many points of the film. It's only circumstances after her arrival that lead her to rethink her plan. Look thru her exterior and you find a strong person who will endure great sacrifice to help those she loves. (Also, many people enter this country every day under many different types of visas, some more valid than others, and many stay long after they expire, so all the comments about visa laws are completely irrelevant to this story.)

 The scenes in the Philippines are warm and colorful which mirrors Dalsisay's life in which she's surrounded by family and people who love her. In America the scenes are more cold and stark which mirrors Deans more empty life. Subtle but clever.

 Not to give away too much but the movie ends on a note of hope rather than a Hollywood ""happily ever after"" type ending that some people may prefer. But I'll take hope anytime. In reality that's often the best we can do.

(Ps. I learned from reading several reviews that this movie was written and directed by an American.)",1102377600,9,2256,4.783505154639175
2083499,2,B0002EYHKI,"I agree with the last review in part.  The whole movie builds the Filipino girl up to be a saint while the American guy is just pathetic.  Then she decides she ""doesn't love him"" and goes off to seek her pot of gold.  That's not the deal.  She was allowed to come here to marry.  You're free to decide you ""don't love"" someone - but you're not free to stay if you do.  This film is ""Exhibit A"" why we have the laws we do - to protect Americans from dishonest opportunists like this girl.  Girls that will use some poor sap to get here.  And then live off the fat of the land stored up by legitimate Americans.  The movie spends all its time making the girl sympathetic and disguising that she's just another opportunist.  Or, rather, justifying it.  All the sympathetic treatment the film gives her and all her tears can't change the meaning - the dishonesty - of her final action.  I think this film is worth seeing.  Especially for potential saps thinking about importing a foreign honey.  Get past all the charming shyness and submissive mannerisms and look at her character and intentions and make sure you both understand just what the deal is.",1102377600,20,1149,4.461538461538462
2083500,1,B0002EYHKI,"This film must have been written and directed by a Filipino.  The parts in the first half set in the Philippines were beautifully photographed and interesting.  The 2nd half is ridiculously melodramatic.  If you enjoy identifying with a main character who deals with his problems by drinking and consorting with prostitutes, this movie is for you.  And the resolution is completely unsatisfying.  The filmmakers think it addresses each character's true needs, it doesn't.  It's more a Filipino fantasy based on a lack of understanding of immigration laws in the US.  The girl would not be allowed to come to the US if the guy had not already met her in person.  She and a cousin evidently came to the US on fianc visas (all this is glossed over in the movie).  With this type of visa they, and everyone else, understands they're here to get married within 90 days to their fianc and ONLY to their fianc.  If they split on their fiances, someone should just pick up the phone and call the proper authorities.  Because they will be deported.  Period.

The movie raises valid issues about inter-cultural ""mail order"" romances.  For example, the guy was looking abroad for family to avoid dealing with his actual family.  However, the movie strikes me as a Filipino fantasy.  The girl can have what she and the filmmakers really want - the ability for her to live in the US and make money to send home without having to marry an American.  Glossed over with the immigration laws is the fact that the supposedly innocent Filipina has in fact defrauded her fianc.  She came here with an understanding and violated it.  The terrible economic plight in the Philippines does, in fact, drive many Filipinas to marry abroad.  This must be a real source of frustration for Filipinos.  So, here we get some wish fulfillment from their perspective: The oh-so-virtuous girl gets access to the US and its money without having to actually give herself away in marriage.  I doubt Filipinas who marry abroad in reality are like the girl in this movie.  I think they also seek to go abroad because they have the idea that Western husbands are superior to what they can get at home.  More faithful, caring, etc.  Not just more money.  But having something like that in the movie would interfere with its Filipino fantasy.

In summary, the first part is interesting but the movie as a whole is just a big downer.

----------------------------------

To address Mr. Lopez's subsequent review and his cavalier attitude towards our immigration laws, dealing with the BICS (formerly INS) with ""mail order brides"" is not the walk in the park he thinks. The girl must go through a tough interview at the American embassy and there must be proof the couple actually know about each other and have actually met. The 2 in the movie never even talked on a telephone. And who knows what they actually wrote in their letters. This is all glossed over YET their expectations are crucial to the setup of the story.

If the director is in fact an American he nevertheless is ignorant of his own country's laws and he markets his films to the Philippines.

As for blaming the problems on the girl, please show me where I (or DGREEN for that matter) have done that. The claim being made by me is that this supposedly honorable girl stiffed her fianc, and the agreement she made to get into the country, as soon as she found a better opportunity. The money problem was addressed but she just bailed out anyway. And unlike a citizen, that's not her option. ""Circumstances after her arrival lead her to rethink her plan"" is a classy way to say as soon as she found something more convenient she reneged, defrauding the guy and this country. Oh but I forget, the cavalier approach to laws and promises is just fine when you're the one doing the defrauding. ... And when everyone here adopts that approach, our women will be emigrating overseas for a better life. Because we will have killed the golden goose and this country will also be too corrupt to have a workable economy.

A likely coda to the ending is the guy's cousin picks up a phone and calls BICS ... and her career in this country is history... It's not like she can't be found (unlike other illegals who skip out on their visas). She's at her cousin's restaurant. Which will likely mean adios for the cousin, too.

I agree with all the points in the reviews of Mr. Lopez and DGreen about the dysfunctional guy. He learns a lot and is certainly to be pitied. The girl on the other hand learns to adopt his approach to life and responsibility: Skip out. And she falls in with her amoral cousin. For her, that's not too hopeful. It's a downer.",1102291200,28,4661,4.638246041412911
2083501,5,B0002EYHKI,"Joseph Nobile has done what Filipino directors have continually failed to do -- show the quiet desperation underlying daily life so many Filipino families.  You will gain respect for our sense of family, sincerity, basic honesty and morality but naivety concerning finance and life in the USA.

You will certainly gain some insights to some of the issues that challenge a successful marriage to a foreigner. I do not want to give away the story or plot twists . . but, if I was not already happily married to a sweet, kind, honorable American, I would want to marry the film's character ""Uncle Ralph.""

The background scenery of the Philippine countryside and scenes involving festivals, typical work places, common people neighborhoods, farm life, upscale homes, transportation, family events, and even the bar scenes make the DVD well worth the purchase price.

You with both laugh and cry during the two-hour viewing of this well filmed movie that has won awards around the World. It is so good that even Jean, the famous Filipina Cupid who has help so many of us find happiness, recommends it.

I do caution you about the use of foul language of several of the New York characters but then in many, many ways this film is close to reality!",1101427200,11,1243,4.789719626168225

2083523,3,B0002EYHKI,"I really enjoyed the scenes filmed in the Philippines.  The American side made me think that the film's producers think that only a loser from a dysfunctional family would consider marrying a Filipina.  I liked the lead character in spite of himself, but come on, hasn't he heard of introduction services on the Internet?  Someone didn't do their research.  But I'm glad the subject was considered, and anyone interested in marrying a Filipina might find after watching this film that the smart thing to do would be to move to the Philippines.  I plan to!",1141776000,3,555,4.8
2083524,4,B0002EYHKI,"Filipino movies are expensive to buy and this one is no exception. It is worth the price of admission though. This movie starts out in a factory in the Philippines were a young filipino women makes her living. The factory is bright and colorful and soon we learn that the people are colorful also. But the people are poor and we soon find out the girl in the factory has a little sister that will die if they do not come up with the money for an operation. So along the way we learn that she has decided to go to america so she can earn the money for her sister.

From the factory the girl goes to a bar. We start to see the bar girls and what life is like for them. We meet the man who runs the bar. He offers her a job in Japan but she is told that from time to time she will have sex with the men. She wants to go to american so he tells her that he will help her to get a visa. Next we find out that in order to get the visa she either has to have sex with him, or she has to come up with money to pay him for his service. ""Agencys"" like this are common in the Philippines and we begin to see how business is done in the bars and what you can expect if you go to them for help.

Next the women goes home to talk to her parents. We really start to see what life is like in the Philippines now. Her father has two carabao and he is out in the water plowing up the ground for rice. We see the nippa hut they live in, make out of nippa or bamboo with a grass roof. We see her family and her little sister who needs the operation. Then we see as she goes with her dad to the money lenders. She needs the money to pay the agency and the first lender turns her down because he is afraid the agency will steal her money and not get her the visa to go to america. The father already owes that money lender 80% of his crop that will not come in for four more months.  The second lender has no problem with his conscious, the price is 10% interest per month, to be paid each and every month, and the father must put up his house, land, and carabao to secure the loan. Even they are poor and so far in debt, they are still a happy family, that enjoys being with each other.

This is all I am going to comment on, because when she gets to american I do not think the film is very accurate on the way Filipino brides are who come to American. My wife is filipino and she was upset by this and she kept saying: ""her cousin is corrupting her, the cousin is corrupting her"". It is a shame that they just do not understand the Filipino women and try to show them the way that they do.

This movie could have been a epic, but they totally miss what filipino women are all about. Yes they love their family and make great sacrifice for their family. But her husband is important to her to and the family she makes for herself is important. Of course in the movie they never get married which just makes it look like she is using him and it is really a put down on asian women that they would show her the way that they do. He treats her good and love her. Most any filipino women would respond by loving him back and be happy that she has a husband who accepts  her & the situation with her family.

Yes, they have family problems, she has the kind of problems that filipino familys have. He has the kind of problems that american familys have. In real life they would find a way to work it all out. I think it is a shame that this movie ends up with a sad ending and that you do not walk away from it feeling good about yourself and the world we live in. Epic movies need to show us how adversity can be overcome. That is why this movie falls way short of all it could be.",1129766400,10,3657,3.9138627187079407
2083525,5,B0002EYHKI,"""Closer to Home"" keeps getting labeled a ""green card"" romance, but that is an inadequate encapsulation of what happens in this 1995 film.  The person in quest of a visa to the United States is Dalisay (Madeline Ortaliz), the young daughter of a Filipino family.  Her younger sister needs an operation, so Dalisay wants to go the U.S. she can work to earn enough money to pay for the surgery.  To accomplish this Dalisay signs up to become a mail-order bride.  Meanwhile, in New York City, Dean (John Michael Bolger), has had enough of the merchant marine and wants to have a permanent home and a family not that he is reaching middle age.  The permanent home becomes his late mother's apartment, to the distress of his sister, Jan (Jane Gabbert), who was counting on selling it, and the family comes from picking Dalisay as his future bride.

The key to this film is that Dalisay and Dean are nowhere close to being together by the end of the first reel.  Dalisay and her father have to explore several options to getting the money she needs for the trip, which includes dealing with loan sharks and other avenues of exploitation, and Dean is trying to keep his life together, working as a cab driver when he is not fighting with his family.  The more they learn about Dean's plans, the less they like them, and by the time Dalisay shows up she is not exactly welcomed with open arms.  Whatever she was thinking living in the United States would be like, this would not be it.  Clearly, buying into the American dream is not as easy as you would think, whether you are an immigrant or a native son.

The portrait of the Philippines culture seems to have more depth, but that could be because the other half of the film showing a family falling apart in New York City is more familiar territory.  Yet the interplay between the two cultures is at the heart of ""Closer to Home,"" and this is one of those films that is worth watching at least one more time in order to reconsider what it all means in the end.  There is a certain rawness to the film, which reinforces the gritty reality of the circumstances of the main characters.  Dean is a flawed human being, quick to anger and on some level aware that he lacks the social skills necessary to make a relationship work, even one in which he pays for a willing bride.  Likewise, Dalisay, is not only understandably naive about what life is going to be like in America, we are not absolutely convinced she can survive.  A happy ending is not inevitable in this film because neither simply wanting the American dream nor trying to buy it assures you of success.

I understand that this movie will have more of an impact for a Filipino audience than for American viewers, but there is still considerable resonance from the latter perspective as well.  This is due primarily to Bolger's performance, because we want Dean to achieve his dream if for no other reason than that endorsing it for him endorses it for everyone.  Even as we are confronted with Dean's failings, our sympathies are still drawn to the character and since they are also with Dalisay and her plight a tension develops between the pair.  We know that we are rooting for both of them, but does that mean we want them to end up together?  This is not a predictable film, which is why calling it a ""green card"" romance totally misses the boat.

This movie is in English and Tagalog with English subtitles, but you have to turn on the subtitles on the DVD.  I did not figure this out so I actually watched it the first time without the subtitles, which was rather interesting because I certainly understood the gist of what was going on even if the specific details regarding how Dalisay's family was going to get the money to get her Visa were beyond my understanding.  I have seen a couple of films where the two main characters only speak their native tongues without subtitles for the ""other"" language (i.e., the non-English one), and I just assumed ""Closer to Home"" was another such film.",1118188800,6,4004,4.536856745479833
2083526,5,B0002EYHKI,"Much of the effectiveness of this deeply affecting and ultimately tragic film is due to what is not shown and what is not said.

Dalisay (Madeline Ortaliz) is a young and pretty Filipino girl who--perhaps among other strategies--puts herself up as a mail order bride in order to get to America to make money to help her family and get medical help for her younger sister who has a heart condition.  Maybe that is her motivation.  What makes this movie so beguiling and intriguing is the ambiguous nature of Dalisay's desire.  She is a ""good girl, a proper girl but...(I am reminded of an old song)...one of the roving kind.""

She tells her family that she will work in America and send them money.  She doesn't tell them that she is a mail order bride.  This is the essential duplicity that Dalisay enters into.  She has a cousin in America who will help her with the details.  Perhaps this is planned.  We really don't know.  Perhaps she is waiting until she sees her intended and will play it by ear from there.  Again, the ambiguity of her desire--and indeed the ambiguity of anyone's desire, especially that of a young girl from a poor rural family in a poor country who has been making her living sewing clothes in a sweat shop--is what intrigues us.  No one's motives are completely pristine.  There is always an element of self-service involved, even in the most humanitarian ventures, even if it is only that of being the one who is doing good.  Dalisay is being good, but one gets the sense as the film develops that she is being good partially for Dalisay.  She has seen what it is like to work in a sweat shop and she has seen what happens to the girls who give their bodies away.  She is wiser than that.  She has a plan.

Director Joseph Nobile who co-wrote the script with Ruben Arthur Nicdao overplays the idyllic rural setting in the early scenes--the good father and family, their hard work, the happy, if poor, children, the bright and ambitious daughter in whom they believe.  They are of course preyed upon by middle men and money lenders, but they hold their heads high.  I think Nobile would have been wise to cut out about half of these opening sequences in the Philippines because they are too cloying, they too much recall the cliches of the good and noble peasants being used by the evil power structure.

However, there is something to be said for the build up.  We do see that although Dalisay brings gifts to her siblings when she visits, and she seems delighted to see the children run alongside the bus, there is some restraint in her affection, some slight distance from the little ones and from her father and mother.  The family affection, although seemingly demonstrated, struck me as lukewarm.  Perhaps that was the intent so as to account for Dalisay's leaving them.

The film begins slowly.  I would have given up on it had I not known of the film's reputation.  I stayed with it and I am glad I did because once Dalisay gets to America about halfway through, the story becomes riveting and develops into a powerful tragedy of conflicting desires, told in stark realism and beautifully acted by Ortaliz and John Michael Bolger who plays Dean.

He is one of live's pathetic losers who has a dream, an island girl of his own, to love him and to serve him and to be his wife and constitute the loving family that he doesn't have.  Ah, but the intrusion of reality!  We see that although Dalisay is good and non-exploitive herself, she has her own dreams and they are not likely to include an over-the-hill, broken-down and drunken cabbie, a guy with a dysfunctional family, a guy who can't keep a job and wears too much cologne.  When he says he loves her we know there is no way she can say she loves him.

An important scene that foreshadows the end catches Dalisay and her cousin Tess at the kitchen table in the apartment.  They are joking in Tagalog about Dean's physical attributes.  We can see how cozy they are, the two women in their shared culture, and how alien Dean is as he comes upon them and doesn't understand what they are saying.  Ultimately we feel sorry for Dean.  We pity him.  Yet we understand and appreciate Dalisay's decision.  She does what she has to do, and she does it with dignity and honor.

A final point: When Dean is seen crying near the end, we the viewers know why he is crying, but his family does not.  For the audience the tears are ambiguous and his tragedy is twofold, just as Dalisay's motivations are ambiguous and twofold.

This is very close to masterpiece.  It is original and faithfully done without choosing sides or assigning blame one way or the other.  Like a Greek tragedy, the end is fated and due to human frailty rather than any conscious iniquity.",1115596800,10,4738,4.536556603773585
2083527,3,B0002EYHKI,"There is a growing business of mail order brides where companies advertise women to men who seek a life partner.  The film Close to Home turns out to be a rather intriguing tale of a mail order bride, as it thoroughly depicts both sides of the issue.  The story displays the man, Dean (John Michael Bolger), who seeks a woman and his status in society while the audience gets to explore the woman's socioeconomic position.  Initially, it seems as if Dean seeks someone out of his league, as he seeks someone beautiful, younger and obedient.  Through the mail order bride service Dean finds such a woman, Dalisay (Madeline Ortaliz), while thumbing through a large a quantity of photos.  According to Dean, Dalisay does not look like a bar girl, as she seems to be young, pretty and neat.

Dalisay seeks an opportunity for a better financial life, as she desires to advance on the social ladder for her family's sake.  As the film unfolds the audience will find out that the street smart Dalisay is from a poor family and her sister is in dire need to have a surgery in order to save her life.  The writer and director Joseph Nobile adds extra layers of human complexity to the film by presenting these problems that she has at home and at work to explains why she is willing to get married to a stranger.  Through Dalisay's problems the audience will experience a thoughtful story that will have genuine emotions, as her and her family's socioeconomic status provides a strong enough argument for why she is deciding to travel to United States.

Dean, on the other hand, is a broke dreamy romantic that seems to believe that marrying a woman and moving into the family apartment will solve all his problems.  The dreamy hopes that Dean has for the future do not rest within a well thought out and organized plan, as he merely seems to believe that a woman will remove all of his problems, while his sister wants to sell the apartment where he lives to their brother-in-law.  Yet, Dean does not want to sell, or cooperate with the family, as he wanders down his own path of self-destruction.  This part of the film sometimes borderlines with soap opera-like  melodrama, as Dean appears too simplistic in contrast to Dalisay.  The contrasts will be boosted when Dalisay arrives to the United States, as her personal strength for survival makes Dean simply look like a loser.

Closer to Home has a strong foundation, as it offers an original story told from two very different angles.  The allocated shooting budget should also be taken into consideration, as it was far less than any big blockbuster.  Nonetheless, the Achilles' heel of the film seems to rest within the cast, as some characters provide a solid performance while others do not seem to be in character.  This definitely hurts the strong message that the film tries to deliver, as it removes the attention from the story and instead directs it toward the flaws.  Yet, some cinematic highlights such as when Dalisay walks on glass provide occasional cinematic inspiration of genius while the content provides some intriguing contemplation.",1114905600,5,3100,4.769662921348314
2083528,5,B0002EYHKI,"Joseph Nobile creates a study in choices and repercussion through an intricate and troubled story of a woman trying to save her family and a man attempting to begin a family.

In order to escape from poverty, the virginal Dalisay (Madeline Ortaliz) sacrifices herself for her provincial family in the Philippines. Her sister desperately needs a heart operation and Dalisay is their only hope. Through a mail-order marriage, she hopes to find more security and opportunity in New York City. As she travels from the Philippines her main goal is to help her family through financial contributions after she secures a job.

As the story progresses, we start to realize that Dean is also trying to save his family, the family he wants to start with Dalisay. He has hopes of a romantic encounter when they meet. It is terribly romantic at first as he attempts to please Dalisay and take care of her, although she is determined to save herself for marriage. She is willing to marry immediately, even without feeling love for Dean. She is also willing to work, but time after time Dean tries to be the provider and seems to be failing to even support himself or keep himself sober. She then has trouble keeping her commitments to her family. As disappointment ensues from unfortunate circumstances, Dean's idealism turns to anger and he turns to alcohol and other women for comfort. We then realize this man can never match her strength of character nor her commitment to family.

The true beauty in Closer to Home is the love Dalisay's father shows as he puts his entire future at risk to pay for his daughter's dream. He has no idea she is leaving to be a fantasy bride. She tells her family she is leaving to become a nanny.

The beauty is in her father's willingness to not only put his livelihood at risk, he is also saving his daughter's purity. If she can't find the money to go to America, then she will have to sell her body for her dream. The love and concern he shows is heart-wrenchingly beautiful. It brought back memories of my own life when my parents put me on a plane and sent me to America. I could understand the insecurity she felt, the culture shock and the initial loneliness.

There are many dreams in this movie and they all intersect and seem to rest upon one man's decision. This is a great study in how one decision can affect many lives in a short period of time. The beginning contrasts sharply with the second half and there is also a contrast between Dalisay's familial concerns and Dean's romantic concerns.

Is Dalisay a strong willed woman or is she just trying to be responsible and provide for her family? She seems to be a great example of a woman who respects herself and knows she is inexorably tied to her family by commitments and love. Dalisay's sacrifice for her family is beautiful and profound.

Closer to Home had a deep emotional impact on me and completely captured my heart in its realistic portrayal of cultures converging within the eternal search for love. Beautifully filmed and intricately woven. A haunting tale of complex desires and overwhelming responsibilities.

What happens when an ''immovable object'' meets an ''irresistible force''?

The ''immovable object'' in this case is a former merchant marine who has returned home after an absence of about two decades and is now determined to remain in the building which once belonged to his now deceased parents and is now in the possession of his sister who is hoping to sell the place to a cousin who runs a small business in the street-level portion of the building. The prodigal brother's refusal to leave disrupts everyone's plans. He hopes to further cement his foothold on the family home by getting married and starting a family of his own, and he chooses to go about this by utilizing a ''mail-order bride'' service.

The Filipina ''picture bride'' he selects is the ''irresistible force'' of the story -- a simple ''country girl'' working in the city of Manila who hopes to work in America so she can earn enough money to pay for a lifesaving operation for her sick & dying little sister, because her father is a struggling farmer who earns too little to pay for the costly medical procedure. Through lying & deception (though not out of maliciousness, but because she believes that the ''honorable'' end she hopes to achieve justifies the ''dishonorable'' means) she forces her father into crushing debt in order to secure her travel documents from the unscrupulous owner of a topless bar who acts as a middleman. Even after the girl's arrival to the ''Big Apple,'' she continues with the deceptions.

Although it is not really her desire to marry the lonesome bachelor who is about twice her age, she seems to give indication that she wishes to live up to the ''promise'' to which she agreed, which she claimed (but never admitted to her mother and father) was her basis for coming to the States. Her ""obligations,"" if you will, get seriously put to the test when a materialistic cousin who also lives in New York City (who likewise came to the U.S. as a ''mail-order bride'' who then ditched the ''Average Joe'' American she was expected to marry for a more entrepreneurial & less ''traditional family values'' beau) pays her a visit and begins filling the young girl's head with the idea that she is not doing nearly as well for herself as she ''could'' be doing, thus setting the stage for even greater disaster in the girl's wake.

With everything to lose, the former seaman's only friend & shoulder of support is an aged uncle who lives in the uppermost portion of the building who likewise wishes to stay put. Expected to ""die"" in Florida after the sale of the building has been finalized, the uncle sees his ability to continue living in the old family home as being dependent on the success of the marriage of the new couple.

Showing how even the best of intentions can lead to major family crisis, ""Closer to Home"" is simultaneously very beautiful & inspiring and very discomforting & depressing.

It also explores how attitudes towards ""money""-- both amongst those who have it and those who desperately need it --motivate people to believe certain things about and behave certain ways toward those in our 'spheres of influence.' Ultimately, with all of the other questions about 'culture' and 'ethics' placed aside, I think this is perhaps the true underlying theme of the movie. -- And what a strong theme it is.",1112832000,8,3325,4.762152777777778
2083530,4,B0002EYHKI,"`Closer to Home' is an independent bilingual (English and Tagalog with English subtitles) film by first time director Joseph Nobile filmed about half in the Philippines, in and around Manila, and about half in New York City, in, I believe, Brooklyn.

This is a very difficult film to watch, as it has the feel of a descent into hell without Dante's poetry or Virgil's companionship to smooth over the steady decline into dispair by the two lead characters and their families. As good as this movie is in presenting this story, this means that the film is exceedingly difficult to watch even once, let alone a second or third time, which makes one wonder whether it is worth purchasing the DVD, especially as there is no director's commentary to make a second watching offer up additional rewards. Movies like this, like Terry Gillian's `Brazil' or Francois Truffaut's `The 400 Blows' are hard to watch because they are doing something right in the way in which the story is brought to the screen.

While I am not 100% sure of what this term means, this movie seems with certainty to fit the mold of `Cinema Verite'. The story is incredibly believable. And, it is the inevitability of the conclusion which both turns the tale into a tragedy while offering no relief in surprise or a hope that the two main characters will pull themselves out of the hell they created for themselves arising from the very best intentions.

The DVD jacket describes the film as being about two different families, yet the quality of the telling is much better on the Philippine side of things than with the American family. There is some possibility that this is due to the fact that the Filipino's are much more deeply locked into poverty than the members of the American family and the fall by the American characters is much more due to internal weaknesses than to external circumstances. This adds to the interest of the film, but it means that while the American characters have a greater wealth of flaws and conflicts to play upon, the presentation of the interaction between the American characters is much less well done than the playing out of family solidarity among the Filipinos.

For all the quality in the presentation of this story, I feel something is missing. I suspect the missing element may depend a lot on what you look for in this kind of movie. My first choice is that maybe I never developed a sympathy for the two main characters. The young Filipino girl, Dalisay, is more sympathetic than the American man, Dean, but I can never quite shake the feeling that the plan requiring her family to collect $2000 to send her to the United States in order to acquire $5000 for Dalisay's sister's heart operation seems just a little too self serving to the interests of the young girl, as innocent and selfless as she may seem. The risks to the family farm and livelihood, as poor as it is, make this plan even more selfish, especially as the family is risking all of this on Dalisay's lie about her true plans. Dean is acting out of no motive other than a need to reclaim a sense of family that he did little to deserve from his own kin while his parents were alive. This may all be very Shakespearean, as the tragedy springs from the characters' flaws as surely as the bloodbath at the end of Hamlet springs from Hamlet's indecision, but, good reader, this ain't Hamlet. The air throughout the film is one of desperation and inevitability. So, my second choice is the lack of art to bring some redeeming emotion to the fall of the two principle characters, especially as they succeeded in bringing their family's fortunes down with them.

But here's the rub. Both of these aspects actually contribute to the power of the story. They just mean that this movie is not entertaining in a conventional manner.

Regarding the quality of the DVD presentation, I always feel cheated if there is no director's commentary. And, while this movie seems less needful of one than, say, a movie by Peter Greenaway or John Boorman or Terry Gillian, it does add to the rewatchability of the DVD. I also thought the English subtitles to the Tagalog dialogue should not have been an option you needed to turn off. If the DVD is marketed in the US, it should have been something you can turn off, but be on by default. And, while I didn't really miss anything from the full screen presentation, I always prefer the letterbox presentation.

If this is, indeed, the director's first film, it is, in its own way, at least as good as Kevin Smith's first effort, `Clerks', albeit I will watch `Clerks' over many times while I believe I will leave this one on the shelves.

Note that the film's producer solicited this review from me and supplied me with the DVD to review. I hope this fact has not biased my opinion and you, good reader, will get some benefit from my assessment. Now, I will quietly return to my cookbooks.",1111881600,8,4896,4.632488479262673
2083531,4,B0002EYHKI,"CLOSER TO HOME is the product of writer/director Joseph Nobile who made this film in 1995 and is so committed to his work of love that he is still pounding the streets for an audience after ten years of festival awards and widely varying responses from the critics, both form the media and form the viewers.  I think his fight is well worth his effort.

CLOSER TO HOME is in no way a highly polished, glitzy, Hollywood chick flick.  This is not a film that leaves the audience whistling the credits tune while ambling out of the theater talking about fluff and superficial situations.  This little two hour film may reference such hits a 'Love is a Many Splendored Thing' or 'Madame Butterfly' or 'Sayonara', but the references are only to the ages old concept of the mail order bride market.  Joseph Nobile has the courage to move beyond the pink bubbly dreams of love conquering all and instead examines the bipolar needs and inner histories of why the individuals on both ends of arranged marriages (especially those involving imported brides from poor countries) can encounter more tragedy than happy victories.

Nobile wisely divides his film between the Philippines and New York City, drawing many parallels between the monetary poverty of the one with the emotional poverty of the other.  He opens up the atmosphere of the Philippines by allowing us to see the various strata of life from the bars, the streets of Manila, the factories, the farms still employing carabao to work the meager fields.  From this palette he plucks one beautiful young girl Dalisay (Madeline Ortaliz) and explains why her need to provide for her family and her young sister in need of cardiac surgery instills the drive to go to America to find a husband and requisite funds to send money home.  After the difficult task of convincing her family that her departure is a sound solution to the family's financial needs, she consents to be a mail order bride, follows the disparate regulations and problems of obtaining a Visa and departs her beloved family for the promise of the American Dream.

Meanwhile, in New York, we meet Dean (John Michael Bolger), an ex-Merchant Marine who tasted the flavor of the East and longs for a Filipina bride to fill the vacuum of not having grown up with an intact family.  His sister and friends are angered that Dean will not sell the family flat, a move that would provide financial escape from their lives of loneliness and disenchantment with their lack of meaningful family history.  Dean sees importing Dalisay as his bride will provide him with all of the love his dissolute life has eschewed.

Dalisay arrives in the US, tries to uphold her wobbly dreams, but eventually must accept the fact that she does not love the intended destitute groom and must forge her own life to fulfill her commitment to her family.  Dean is crushed by the failure of this ultimate dream but out of the chards of his ideals he finds a semblance of family after all.

This films is not without flaws: though the photography is beautiful in places it is poorly choreographed in others, making extended scenes of dialogue feel more like a ping pong game than a creative exploration of character.  Some judicious editing would tighten the drama and while that may exclude some of the characters in the drama, it would make the focus stronger.  The actors vary greatly in credibility and the 'at will' interchange  between Tagalog and English can become distracting.

But in the long run, CLOSER TO HOME is an important alternative view of the American Dream and a forceful and thoughtful one at that.  It is a film that if taken for its message is a film to remember and cause reflection on the daily interpersonal tragedies that can become too easily ignored in this busy world we have created.  Grady Harp, March 05",1110931200,12,3821,4.759090909090909
2083532,4,B0002EYHKI,"Finally, an award winning movie that realistically shows life in rural Philippines. See the daily life of a small town family. Their relationships, hardships and joys. See their home, their town and the countryside with over 25 Philippines' locations included.

 Then see how and why this pretty Filipina teenager meets an older American man, their courtship, and how she copes with the USA culture shock the first few months after she arrives in the USA.

 Closer to Home is a 2 hour high quality DVD movie with an interestering story as well as much about life in small towns in Philippines. I highly recommend it because it exists.  I am sure Mr. Nobile worked very hard against difficult barriers to make this movie.

 I wish story was more realistic to today's foreign romance events and had a happier ending, but that movie exists only in my, and tens of thousands of others, imagination. Or, in the memory of the thousands that have lived it.  Mostly, happy memories I am sure!  Jean

I have spent 12 trips and 21 years going all over the Philippines specifically observing and interviewing 1000's Filipinas and this film perfectly exemplifies the great divide between our TRUE attitudes and cultures! Superficially our cultures are similar, but true motivations, family and cultural attitudes are very different! That is IF YOU ARE A FOREIGNER! What most Filipinas regularly try on and expect from foreigners they wouldn't dare to try on or expect from Filipinos (their is name for that). And even though the American in this movie could look like a loser professionally/financially, in comparison to the Filipino this poor province girl in the middle of nowhere could marry, the American is an honorable savior by comparison! And I have heard of and met many foreigners in the Philippines that were well to do or rich and became desolate directly due to their big heart and naivety and what the Girls/Investments and Filipino culture can do to foreigners! And from what I have observed the typical foreigners go into the Philippines searching for a wife are NOT Exactly WOMEN SAVVY and are idealistic to the fault of being naive. And many have been divorced multiple times to prove it. Except for the middle class and the rich Filipinas (which usually could care less to even know your name), Filipinas can't help but to believe all foreigners are rich and their primary goal is money (help) to their families and for many - independence! They are trapped in a man's world and grow up getting tricked and used by Filipinos or watching their mom, sister or best friends getting used or fooled. Abandoned single mothers are everywhere. And sickness and death visits their pets and family members regularly with no savings, insurance or quality health care to face it. The Result is FILIPINAS are a lot tougher then the foreigners that court them even at 1/2 or 1/3 their age! Most foreigners (that are serious to marry) are fantasizing for sex, companionship and lasting love. As long as the money flows to their families and your  good to your wife and If you didn't get an independent playgirl your pretty safe! But if the money (support to their family) isn't enough or you married a man hater or playgirl, you're in big trouble. Typically Filipinas going to a foreigners country have little to lose and everything to gain and they know it although they will NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE IT! This video should be required reading for every foreigner contemplating to search for an Asian bride. My very expensive experience and observations  free of charge but priceless to the wise!

8027378,1,B0002EYHKI,"I feel that this movies purpose was to reinforce stereotypes and discourage international marriage. I feel that it was highly prejudicial and lables the girl as a ""mail order bride"" just because she is from the Philippines and any Filipino girl that marries abroad is supposed to be labeled as a ""mail order bride"" I rented the movie because I felt it would help me to understand the whole stigma on the Philippines but instead it showed me just how ignorant and prejudiced we are here on the other side of the ocean. In the movie the he brought her over without actually meeting her in person first which I's sure many do that was one thing i noticed then he himself was a total looser.  But the film seems to be demonizing her for leaving him when any woman in her right mind would have left this character because he did not fulfill or even attempt to fulfill her dreams of the perfect marriage. But the film does not label him because of course he's Caucasian and we cannot label Caucasians as we are the master race.  But its o.k. for us to label them. He did not court her, he did in any way try to build a relationship with her. This films assumes that all the men that marry Filipino women are looser and all of the Filipino women that marry Foreign men do so just for a free ticket or want a free ticket.  And where they might see it as a chance of a lifetime most Filipinas that I have met would rather stay where they are then to marry under those circumstances, and I've met hundreds.  This movie does a lot of damage to normal girls just looking for love and better life who will be labeled for something they are not. It did not feel that the script was very good nor informative but it did give a glimps into their life so I was somewhat prepared when I finally when to visit.  But most of all i am disappointed in the labeling and racist aspect of labeling people as ""mail order brides"" just because of where they come from. I think most westerners do see it as racist but it is. It's racism, fear mongering, labeling, discrimination and it reinforces Stereotypes and misinformation.  As far as I could see no one shipped this girl over in the mail. Although not good The fact that he did not build a relationship also does not make her a ""mail order bride"" Fear mongering always does more damage than good. These are human beings not dogs and its time to treat them that way.  As entertainment it was not very entertaining as well because I do not find labeling entertaining.
