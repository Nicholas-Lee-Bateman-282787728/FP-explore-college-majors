8027993,3,B0002HJMS2,"*** 1948. Based on a novel by Dagmar Edqvist, this film was written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. A blind pianist tries to find his place in the society but loses little by little his social rank by accepting cheap jobs. A former peasant girl who managed to get educated through hard work will help him to give up the idea of suicide. One of Bergman's first efforts that could appeal to Bergman's completists or to curious ones. Some scenes like the initial dream of the pianist, filled with symbols, or Mai Zetterling's performance were a sufficient reward for me. If you try hard enough, you'll be able to find a zone 2 DVD of this film, titled MUSIC IN DARKNESS, released by U.K. based Tartan Video. The copy is superb, the sound rather bad. With English subtitles.",1208649600,,770,4.586956521739131
8027994,1,B0002HJMS2,"Another melodrama, which seemed to be a typical requirement of the era. It's too sweet at times, too artificially tragic and too non-believable, all leading to a happy-end. Still a ""watchable"" film, but one won't miss much by skipping it. For completists only.",1189728000,,260,5.069767441860465

I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS THE ORINGINAL JANUS FILMS RELEASE IN VHS, BUT THIS IS A KNOCK OFF VERY POOR, EXTEMELY POOR COPY MADE FROM WHAT LOOKS LIKE POINTING A CONSMER VHS CAMERA AT A SCREEN USING AN OLD 16MM PRINT OF SUCH VERY POOR QUALITY THAT IT IS HAD TO SEE THAT IS WHY IT WAS RETURNED FOR FULL REFUND.  IF FOR SOME REASON THAT THE REFUND DOES NOT COME I WILL MAKE A CLAIM WITH MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY.  DENNIS PIES",1170115200,,454,3.978021978021978
