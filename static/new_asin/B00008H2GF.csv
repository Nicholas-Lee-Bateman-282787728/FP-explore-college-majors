Jane became a shriveled up sleaze-bucket after being introduced to cocaine by a dope-peddler named Nick (Noel Madison). Along the way, Eddie himself is given cocaine by a girl he meets, sending him deep into the bowels of depravity! Watch and shudder!

1847264,5,B00008H2GF,"""She Shoulda Said 'No'!"" is a pretty good cult classic film with acting that was better than I expected in a relatively low budget film. The plot moves along well and the casting was very good, too. The cinematography is essentially a high average but of course that's what you get with these lower budget films. The quality of the print is very good. In addition, this is clearly a message film that attempts to educate people about the ""evil"" effects of marijuana use and how marijuana use can lead to an addiction to other drugs including narcotics. It's a dated film that consequently exaggerates here and there; but it has its point.

When the action starts we are quickly introduced to some of the principle characters in the film: We meet a drug pusher named Markey who preys on young teenagers who want to buy marijuana from him. Markey doesn't care if the drug destroys lives even after there's a huge fatal car crash; he's only interested in the money although his source Jonathan Treanor (Michael Whalen) does worry. Treanor doesn't want to attract any attention so that they can deal drugs as quietly as possible. In addition, we meet Rita (Mary Ellen Popel), a showgirl at the Caf St. Pierre; Markey supplies her with the ""tea"" and when Markey wants to meet the beautiful blonde showgirl Anne Lester (Lila Leeds) he forces Rita to set up a party at Anne's place so he can get to know Anne and introduce her to marijuana.

The party goes on as planned at Anne's house with everyone making a wild mess of themselves as they ransack the place (that's how Hollywood painted the effect of a single marijuana cigarette in those days) and Markey succeeds at talking Anne into smoking her first marijuana cigarette. It's not long after that Anne's younger brother Bob (David Holt) comes home and is horrified that Anne is getting the money to send him to college by selling marijuana! Worse yet, Hugo (Henry Corden), the boss at Caf St. Pierre, fires both Rita and Anne for their recent poor performance and Hugo tells them very candidly he knows they're not working out because they started smoking marijuana.

At the same time, the cops are after Markey, his supplier Jonathan Treanor and anyone else in the crime ring that they can nab and put away. Captain Hayes (Lyle Talbot) has Lieutenants Mason (Robert Kent) and Tyne (Don C. Harvey) hot on Markey's trail. But things won't be easy for the cops; even after they arrest Anne and her friends on drug charges Anne refuses to talk about Markey despite the fact that the cops show her people whose lives have been destroyed by drugs.

Of course, to keep things interesting, the plot can still go anywhere from here. How does Bob handle his discovery that his sister Anne is sending him to college on drug money? What will Anne do after she is released from jail? What about Mason and Tyne--will they ever catch Treanor, Markey and the rest and put them behind bars? Sorry, no plot spoilers--watch and find out!

""She Shoulda Said 'No'!"" has a good plot that moves along well; I was never bored. Sure, the film is dated but it's quite something to be able to view this in our times. I recommend this for people into cult classics; and people who like movies that deal with drug use and abuse will like this film as well.",1249862400,3,3277,4.60445205479452
1847265,3,B00008H2GF,This is a great little anti-drug film.  It's a bit difficult to watch due to Alpha's rather poor print.  It has also been severely edited.,1243036800,,138,4.48
1847266,3,B00008H2GF,"I entered the 7th grade in 1969. Most high schools at the time had the split class Health/Physical Education or gym class as we called it. This was part class room(health) and the PE in the gym. It was during health class that I saw the first of several films warning young teens against drug use. I remember a boy in one film starting with marijuana and then graduating to LSD. During his experience he imagines he's being attacked by a cartoon chicken.
What I didn't know at the time was that these type of films started in the 1930's, the infamous Reefer Madness being the prime example. Most of these films were extremely low budget affairs with teenagers played by actors who looked to be in there late twenties or early thirties.
She Shoulda Said No is no different from most of these films except for one interesting fact. Lila Leeds was a Hollywood hopeful who appeared to headed toward a fairly successful career in film until August 31st, 1948. She was arrested on that date with Robert Mitchum for marijuana possesion. I have read that making this film was part of a court ordered action by the judge who tried her case. The notoriety did nothing to hurt Robert Mitchums career. It torpedoed Lila Leeds hopes for stardom. She only had one uncredited appearance in a film afterward.
These type of films gathered dust until the hippie culture of the sixties blossomed and made them cult films. It wasn't until the advent of home video that they became truly popular. Now just about all of these films are available on DVD. If you are interested in this type of thing, then you might want to give this a try.",1229644800,,1616,4.556701030927835
1847267,4,B00008H2GF,"Jane Bradford is a small town girl lured into a life of big city vice by dope dealing mobster Nick. Jane's brother Eddie comes to the city to look for her. But soon he too is seduced into drug use by his coke sniffing girlfriend Fanny. A third subplot involves a rich party girl named Dorothy who likes to hang with the bad boys at the Dead Rat Cafe. In the end, Nick ""gets his"" though what happens to Jane and Eddie is left up in the air.

This drug related exploitation film differs from ""Reefer Madness"" in many aspects. For one, the potential perils of cocaine use, such as addiction, job loss and financial downturn, are depicted somewhat more realistically though still melodramatically. What makes ""Reefer Madness"" so hilarious is how it exagerrates the effects of weed on human behavior to the point of absurdity. But here coke is shown only to cause a rapid, intensely pleasurable high that, at first, seems relatively harmless. The negative effects are shown to be related to addiction and social stigma rather than how it makes a person behave. The result is that the movie is less funny and perhaps less entertaining, but generally more realistic.

Of course, the acting, editing, script and overall film quality is laughable, as is typical of the exploitation films of the era. But I liked how the movie touched on controversial themes such as the gap between rich and poor, the dangers of illegal abortion and the double standards for men and women. It's an interesting social artifact and fans of the genre will likely appreciate it.",1214697600,,1548,4.729629629629629
1847268,4,B00008H2GF,This flick was a decent attempt for a low budget film. The acting was bad but not terrible. Interesting to me was that they wouldn't show anyone actually snorting the drug. They would pan away when someone was taking a snort. I guess they didn't want younger viewers to learn anything about the How-To part of doing drugs. The ending left a lot of loose ends dangling but whatcha gonna do?,1209600000,,389,4.492957746478873
1847269,5,B00008H2GF,"I was fascinated by this low-budget effort to portray a story in which the usual innocents are lured into a life of depravity and drug addiction. My Alpha copy was often so scarred and battered and dark that it actually enhanced the ambiance of dreary hopeliness for the main characters. A game cast tries to buoy this effort up despite the low-budget sets and budget. The best scenes are shot at the Dead Rat Bar where we're entertained by two long-gone and forgotten vocalists who were probably on the fringes of Hollywood anyway. Another good sequence is the Opium Den where a drug-crazed sister finds her drug-crazed brother who, like her, has become ""a hop-head."" The performers do an outstanding job trying to delineate their roles and the passage of nearly 70 years makes you wonder whatever became of them and the making of this film. For instance, how were they chosen to be in the cast, who did their wardrobes, what did they discuss between scenes, what did they do after work? This movie follows the tradition of ""Reefer Madness"" and ""Marijuana"", providing us with a glimpse of what our great-grandparents may have watched at the Bijou during those early days of the 30s.",1175040000,,1183,4.775609756097561
1847270,3,B00008H2GF,"Producer Willis Kent, who specialized in westerners back in the day, switched gears late in his career focusing on the release of exploitive cautionary features, the stated intent being to warn an unsuspecting public of the evils of various illicit activities (I suspect his real goal was to capitalize on the public's fascination with luridness) as depicted in melodramatic features like Smashing the Vice Trust (1937), The Wages of Sin (1938), Mad Youth (1940), and this early entry titled The Cocaine Fiends (1935) aka The Pace That Kills.  Directed by William A. O'Connor (Playthings of Hollywood, Confessions of a Vice Baron), the film includes Lois January (Society Fever), Noel Madison ('G' Men), Sheila Bromley (Playthings of Hollywood), Dean Benton (The Return of Chandu), Eddie Phillips (Death Valley Manhunt), Frank Shannon (Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe), and Lois Lindsay (Men Are Such Fools), a one time dance instructor who once taught Shirley Temple.

As the film begins we see a couple of mooks in a car trying to avoid capture by the police (seems the men are involved in peddling smack).  The driver drops Nick (Madison) off at a roadside diner where he meets Jane (January), who runs the place with her mother.  The police show up, Jane hides Nick (he feeds her a bit about being chased by highwaymen), and afterwards Nick comments on her agitated state, offering her some `headache' powder.  Jane becomes enchanted with Nick and his big city ways, enough so to follow him to the asphalt jungle, the thought being the pair would get married.  Time passes and Jane comes to the realization big city life isn't all its cracked up to be, as not only is she hooked on `headache' powders, but also a gangster's moll.  During Nick's rounds, Jane sees her brother Eddie (Benton), working at a local drive-in, along with a woman named Fanny (Bromley), the latter a customer of Nick's.  Fanny takes a fancy to Eddie, who has come to the city in search of Jane, and gets him hooked on Nick's fabulous `headache' powders.  More time passes and we see Jane, discarded by Nick, has changed her name to Lil, and hophead Eddie and Fancy are shacking up in a flophouse on skid row, having both been fired from their jobs due to ugly rumors floating around about their personal lives.  At some point a rich, young socialite named Dorothy (Lindsay) with a taste for the seedy side of things gets thrown into the mix (Nick's taken a real shine to her).  Things between Eddie and Fanny sour seriously (she's been walking the streets to earn money to support his ever growing habit), Fanny's life takes a serious turn for the worse, and Eddie ends up in an opium den where he's found by his sister Jane aka Lil, who tries to convince him to kick the junk and go home.  There's some goings on at a hoodlum hangout called The Dead Rat Caf (seriously), including a couple of musical numbers followed by Dorothy being abducted (seems Nick is going to use her in a curious, i.e. lame-brained, scheme to take over the dope rackets), and things eventually come to a head as Jane tries to score some dough from Nick to help her hophead brother.

While The Cocaine Fiends doesn't have the frantic energy and dubious delights displayed in Reefer Madness (1936), probably the most well known of these early `cautionary' exploitation films, it does have its seedy, little, melodramatic charms.  The performances are fairly goofy, and the dialog laughable, enough so to entertain most who take on the venture of watching tale of woe.  There is some oddness here as producer Kent made a film in 1928 titled The Pace That Kills and used some of the footage in this 1935 version, which I guess is something of a remake.  It's pretty obvious when the footage is used, as the story skews slightly, and said footage has a very different look than that which was shot in 1935.  I did learn a number of things while watching this film, including the following...

1. If someone offers you `headache' medicine, especially the kind taken up the schnoz, you should probably pass.

2. Jane's about as gullible as the day is long, that is if there were fifty hours in a day.

3. Dames, unlike men, tip in smiles.

4. Making whoopee had a different meaning back in the day than it does now.

5. If Eddie was any greener he'd be broccoli.

6. The life of a dicarded gangster's moll is about as unglamourous as it sounds.

7. Apparently working at a drive-in diner back in the day was a real plum job.

8. Jane and Eddie's mother is optimistic to a fault, waiting for letters that never come.

9. Hopheads are unlikely to engage in correspondence (or personal hygiene, for that matter).

10. The Dead Rat Caf, despite its repellant name and dcor (including rodent themed wallpaper), seems to be doing a heck of a business.

11. Someone out there, at some point, made and sold wallpaper featuring abnormally large rats.

12. Eddie sure likes to say the word hophead.

13. An opium den isn't the best place to grab a little sack time.

One aspect missing was the actual usage of any cocaine.  Whenever someone would use it, we'd be looking somewhere else.  Heck, I don't think we even saw any cocaine in the film, other than that which was supposed to be concealed in small packets.  There's a number of fairly entertaining sequences, but I think my favorite is when Nick, driving about town with Jane, pulls up to a school telling Jane some of his customers will be getting out soon.  We don't see any transactions, but it does well to magnify the character's unmitigated rottenness, just in case anyone was unclear on the matter up until that point.  As far as the actual story, things kind of bounce around between a number of characters as we witness the ruination wrought upon their lives by the vile, addictive devil powder, leading up to some interesting, albeit far-fetched, twists at the end.  All in all not a bad film for its kind, and a decent complement to Reefer Madness, if you're the sort who enjoys these little exploitative nuggets of joy.

The fullscreen picture on this Alpha Video DVD release is very rough at times, as a good portion of the film is washed out, marked with signs of age, and missing numerous frames.  As far as the audio, it starts off well, but deteriorates into various states of crumminess as the film progresses.  While the video and audio are lacking, it's probably unfair to be overly critical as the film wasn't really the kind of feature someone would go through a lot of effort to preserve for some seventy odd years, so this is probably as good as it's going to get, without someone making a monumental investment in any restorative activities of which I'd doubt they'd see a suitable return.  There are no extras on this disc, other than a video display showing the covers of other Alpha releases.  One thing's for sure, the cover of the DVD here is certainly interesting and entertaining...

1847271,5,B00008H2GF,"There are certain people who love and collect these government sponsored movies from the 1930's. 'Reefer Madness' is the most famous of these ridiculous pictires, but there are other very good ones, Cocaine Fiends is one of them. All the plots in these movies are the same. A good person (usually a young female) is steered off the wayward path by a slick talking hustler with drugs to sell.

In Cocaine Fiends a young girl who runs a restaurant with her mother makes the mistake of hiding a 'dope peddler' from federal agents after a car chase. He offers her some 'headache powder' after the coast is clear. Next thing you know he's telling her she needs to be in the big city and can be in a show. Well her life goes pretty much downhill from there after she becomes a full blown cokehead.

These films are enjoyable for me. I find it odd how the 'Good ol' days' and 'Those Simple Times of Yesteryear', were as dangerous and decadant as today.",1091318400,17,945,4.456647398843931

7984195,5,B00008H2GF,"""The Cocaine Fiends"" (aka ""The Pace That Kills"") is a fairly average exploitation film that depicts the dangers of drug abuse as they were seen back in the 1930s. Although this film must have had some impact at the time it was released, people are correct to notice that this film is rather mild by today's standards. For example, we never see anyone--not anyone--in the film actually using cocaine or any other drug although we do see people having a few drinks in a nightclub here and there. In addition, the plot moves along pretty well and the casting was great--the acting was considerably better than I expected for this motion picture. The cinematography is average and the print is in need of a full restoration.

When the action starts, drug pusher Nick (Noel Madison) hides out in a small town country diner run by Jane Bradford (Lois January) and her mother. Nick gives Jane some cocaine as ""headache powder"" to help her relieve a stress headache; and then it isn't long before he sweet-talks Jane into coming to the big city with him, all the while helping Jane to more and more ""headache powder."" Jane goes with him and is horrified when she finds out that she's been using ""dope;"" but it's too late as Jane is hooked. Jane even changes her name; she now goes by ""Lil"" to avoid anyone tracing her back to her roots in the country where she feels she would be a disgrace to her mother. Jane even denies her own identity when she runs into her brother Eddie (Dean Benton) at a nightclub in the city; Eddie came there to find Jane but Jane isn't about to return home.

Meanwhile, we see the incredibly bad effects of cocaine on all the young people who start taking it--there's Eddie and his addicted girlfriend Fanny (Sheila Bromley) who will do anything for Eddie even though Fanny knows he doesn't really love her. We see even more of the bad side of city life in the seedy and drug lord operated Dead Rat Caf with its wallpaper that actually has drawings of dead rats on it!

There are also great performances by Lois Lindsay as Dorothy Farley, daughter of the wealthy Mr. Farley (Frank Shannon); and Marin Sais does a great job of playing Jane and Eddie's mother, Mrs. Bradford.

Despite some very good acting, The Cocaine Fiends is very dated although sadly the message about the dangers of drugs still needs to get out. Drugs are a real problem in our society; but the ways we deal with the problem have changed somewhat with time. For example, pictures like this one would never even make it to the big screen in our day; this film is extremely dated and it's probably too tame in many ways. However, if you enjoy exploitation films with moralistic messages from the early decades of the 20th century, you would do well to get this film.",1259366400,2,2755,4.548387096774194
