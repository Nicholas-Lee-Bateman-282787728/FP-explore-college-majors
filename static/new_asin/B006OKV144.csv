8502043,5,B006OKV144,"Maskhead is a movie that has no limits with its contents of intense violence, a bisexual cowboy, two lesbian snuff filmmakers, a disturbing masked killer known as the movie title itself - Maskhead. It's a movie that will satisfy fans of extreme cinema and it's definitely not a movie for the squeamish. Directed by Fred Vogel (The Man who brought us ""The August Underground Trilogy"" and many more hardcore horror features) and Scott Swan (writer of two ""Master Of Horror"" episodes - Cigarette Burns & Pro-Life). With all the blood shed and torture scenes, they're also some slowburn scenes, but it's still a 10 out of 10 for me and It would really be awesome to see a movie mainly about the movie title character itself, Maskhead.",1517961600,,730,4.755905511811024
8502044,1,B006OKV144,"Two women who own a ""modeling"" agency with many promises interview people for a film. When they start performing in the film, they get tied up, tortured and killed in various bloody ways. That's it. No acting, no decent sound track. Just gore porn snuff.

Guide: F-word, sex, nudity. Explicit sex talk.",1478908800,,302,4.8076923076923075
8502045,5,B006OKV144,"Love me some Fred Vogel. This one's a fluff job for him. Dark, infested fluff, yes, but fluff. He deals with some serious stuff, some nasty stuff. Guy deserves a break. Plus, if you're as sick as I, this is fun to watch. When I say ""sick"", well, come on, I'm looking forward to my next chance to watch Serbian Film and Philosophy of a Knife. There has to be something wrong with me.
There was only one image here that truly gave me nightmares afterward. You'll see it if you can hang in until the end.
The joke is, the villains are just way more charismatic than any of their victims. No diss on the actors in the walk-on-disrobe-then-die category, it's the way the Vogels wanted it to be. Trust me, the folks behind August Underground know how to make a viewing public morally uncomfortable.",1405987200,2,792,4.431506849315069
8502046,5,B006OKV144,great movie fred you got to make a part 2 this is sweet if you like the aug. underground series you wil dig this,1400630400,,112,3.7083333333333335
8502047,2,B006OKV144,"After the au trilogy toetag went with a more traditional horror style with maskhead they attempt to combine the faux snuff of august underground and horror monster plot. Have to say they fail. The gore in this one takes the back seat and relies on plot more or less. So you'd think the plot would be at least somewhat enjoyable. It isn't, most scenes are drawn out awkward conversation and than a flash in the pan kill scene. The characters are boring the death scenes weak and the plot is crap. For having the film called maskhead the focus sure is not on him. Tho I will say the last scene is great nothing left to the imagination. Borrow from a friend do buy especially for the high prices on here.",1309478400,4,701,4.358778625954199
8502048,4,B006OKV144,If you have seen other films such as the august underground film series or the redsin tower then you must see Maskhead. As a fan of Toe tag and fred vogel i was in aw when i saw this film. another great crazy film for gore and horror fans. The movie kept my attention from start to finish. The gorgous actors done a great job and the special effects are great as the other movies from toe tag.,1285286400,,393,4.051282051282051
8502049,5,B006OKV144,Another gem from our sick and twisted friends at ToeTag.  This one begins strong but dies down a little bit through the middle.  But hang in there...as this is actually acceptable because we are all blessed with a mind blowing unforgiving scene at the end that will make any sicko's day:)  The gore and picture is getting more and more beautiful every film giving us exactly what we want.  Definitely pick this one up and add it to your collection!,1267488000,3,448,4.5625
