If you have never read the books you may like this but personally was disappointed in how much they modified the storyline.",1513123200,,247,4.061224489795919
8673309,5,B00MNS2PQO,"My students and I REALLY expected a movie that would be more in line with the novel than this was, but it gave a great back ground for a compare/contrast essay on the similarities and differences between the book and the movie.

The writing on the packaging is in French, but the movie is in English. Ill be using this movie as a wrap up to the novel for many years.",1509840000,,366,4.154929577464789
