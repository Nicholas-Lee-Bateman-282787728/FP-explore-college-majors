1837335,4,B00008DDJE,"This video is similar to her others, with new people behind her and new music. The other reviewer is not totally correct in regards to the ""annoying"" music - that particular soundtrack is only for the first 5-7 minutes of the entire 30 minute video.
My only ""wish"" for this one is that she did more toning for even more areas. This is not to say that the toning is lacking, really... there are lots of different moves that target different muscle groups, with brisk walking in between. I guess I just sort of wanted even more (maybe a little longer than 30 minutes?).
Otherwise, I'm very satisfied with this title.  :)",1052524800,14,618,4.517857142857143
1837336,4,B00008DDJE,"This version of Walk Away the Pounds is pretty much what you would expect if you have used any of the other dvd's in the series. Lots of walking, kicks, knee lifts, etc. This time you make use of the weights(or ""stretchie"") much more then in the previous ones, which can be good or bad I guess depending on what you are looking for.
However, there is one thing I need to say about Express. This video contains what may be the worst soundtrack ever produced! Words can not describe how awful the music is. Instead of the usual cookie cutter pseudo techno score you have come to expect from workout videos, it seems they have decided that it would be better to have something resembling hip hop, with a man shouting the same few lines over and over again.
FEELS GOOD.....POWERWALK!
WORKS GREAT....POWERWALK!
This is what you will hear, on a continuous loop, for the duration of the 30 minute workout. My god, it feels like you are being reprogrammed. Why are they convincing me how great it is, I already bought the thing :). The first time I watched it, at around the 15 minute mark, I suddenly couldn't stand it anymore and in a frenzy found the remote and hit mute.
Overall, the video is a good workout, and if you liked the others then you will probably like this one as well. Just be prepared to watch it in silence, or to have your own music handy :).",1050969600,40,1355,4.380952380952381
1837364,5,B00008DDJE,"I really love this tape. It got me into excellent shape last summer and I am starting back up again for the coming months. Great fast paced cardio segments along with a LOT of squats and lunges. There is some bicep, tricep, and chest work too, but the main strength training is for the legs. If you want to get toned fast, this is a great workout. Do it 4-5 times a week and you'll be looking good in about 6 weeks. Promise.",1459900800,,424,4.120481927710843
1837365,4,B00008DDJE,"A good basic workout to a clear beat that is easy to hear. No band is included and it's necessary for the routine. The group is one of my favorites fun, hardworking and attractive. It's an older DVD but a good one for me to use maybe every 8 days or so. I'd love to see some of this group again in a newer dvd.",1459814400,2,310,3.7846153846153845
1837366,3,B00008DDJE,"I love Leslie, but I do not like this one. The music is irritating and I don't like stopping the walk to use the stretchie band.",1459296000,,128,3.9615384615384617

1837369,3,B00008DDJE,"The reason I gave this walk only 3 stars is because it DOES NOT come with the stretchie band that is used in the workout! If this is your  first intro to Leslie, may I suggest you purchase Walk Away the Pounds- Ultimate Collection. It has four complete workouts: 1,2,3, or 4 miles all on one DVD, and it comes with the band. This is a much better value.",1453680000,,353,4.115942028985507
1837370,3,B00008DDJE,Beware that you need a stretch band for this workout. I have another Leslie Sansone dvd and I like it. This one however requires a stretch band that I don't have so I haven't gone through the complete workout.,1452124800,,209,4.384615384615385
1837371,5,B00008DDJE,"I love Leslie! I have been doing her workout dvds (off and on) for many years.  I love that she is not ashamed of her faith, and throws it in her workouts, and I love that she has every age group imaginable in her newer videos.",1449619200,,227,3.9347826086956523
1837372,5,B00008DDJE,This two mile walk is perfect for cardio and upper body strength.  The time flies with alternating between walking and band work to strengthen the arms and upper body....a total workout.  Highly recommended.

1837395,5,B00008DDJE,"I own 35 Leslie Sansone DVD's.  This is an older workout but I ordered it to add variety.  The moves are the same however, the strength training adds to the workout.  A good workout.  I measure my purchases in terms of ""Did I get my money's worth?""  Yes, I did.",1427414400,5,261,4.14

1837397,5,B00008DDJE,Leslie inspires me to walk!  This dvd is a great addition to my Leslie Sansone Walk DVD Collection.

1837441,3,B00008DDJE,"According to Leslie's intro this workout should be about 2 miles, but my pedometer rarely logs over 1.5 when I do this workout. It is a decent quick workout, but not my favorite Walk at Home DVD. I really like the 4 mile express challenge so I had higher expectations.",1372982400,,268,4.38
1837442,3,B00008DDJE,"This one can be a bit misleading since its a 30 min program yet you only walk for 15 min in it. She doesn't even walk in place while doing band exercises. It goes like this 5 min walk, 5 min band, 5 min walk, 5 min band etc Some lunges and squats are present too. I love Leslie' s DVDs but I didn't love this one. Maybe if strength segments were shorter so that more walking could be incorporated? I get her DVDs because I love her walks. That is why this one wasn't a great one for me.",1370736000,,486,3.87
1837443,5,B00008DDJE,"I rated this five because the product came quick and like new.  It's an awesome video if you really want to lose some weight.  It's fast, it's high powered and it's good.",1366070400,2,170,4.28125

1837446,4,B00008DDJE,This workout uses the strechie bands in a different way. A lot of arm work. We really felt the burn.,1360281600,,100,4.05
1837447,5,B00008DDJE,One of the best exercise tapes around. If you do as it says you will have amazing results. In 3 months I lost 19 lbs. and 13 inches.,1274745600,,132,3.75
1837448,5,B00008DDJE,"We have formed an exercise club at work.  During our lunch hour, several of us co-workers go to the conference room and put Leslie's videos on the big screen TV. We chose from quite a various selection, the 2mile workouts, the 3mile when we feel really ambitious, the big ball one when we want to have fun.  Actually, all the videos are fun and keep your interest.  The routines do not get boring even though they use the same 4 basic moves. I have been using Leslie's exercises for 4-5 years.  They are quick and easy to learn, good to do with a group or by yourself. The half-hour routines are just the right length and do give a complete work out. We highly recommend these beginners and experienced exercisers.",1184198400,7,714,4.469230769230769
1837449,5,B00008DDJE,"I think this tape is the BEST! I took it to my 47 year old daughter's house since I had no DVD player. We've used it everyday with my 17 year old granddaughter and are addicted to it, so I gave it to them and am ordering another, since I now have a DVD player of my own! Only thing is that you should have a 'stretchie' for the best use of this tape. I have lost 30# since July 4th by following Leslie's walking videos and healthy eating.",1179014400,7,438,3.932584269662921
1837450,5,B00008DDJE,"I had a blast with this video!! Changed it up a little just to make it a little more advanced,but think it's just great. Nice workout in a short time. Have several Sansone videos and this is one of my favorites.",1177286400,5,211,4.170731707317073

It's a good workout and I'm to the point where I feel guilty if I don't do it, it's so easy to fit in.  The girls in the background are average and not annoying so that's a plus.",1169164800,8,292,4.0
1837452,4,B00008DDJE,"I loved the tape, only thing is Amazon did not advertise the need for the strechy band. But you can call on the number on back of the DVD and order one or go to Super Walmart and buy it their. Other then that that's not leslie's fault because her site advertises the need for it. WHY I LOVE it.... Well I lost a lot of weight with the tape, I used it everyday and went from a size 14 to a size 6 in a matter of months. That includes eating well and doing some extra push-up and crunches on my own 3 times a week after the Walk strong workout.. NOT dieting.. I hate diets to loose weight... I would definetly recommend her tape to my friends as I have and they love it too... Matter fact I lost so much weight I would love to be in her vidoes as a supportive person letting it be known they really do work... I enjoyed the toning in walk strong, that's my favorite...",1138579200,35,866,3.9827586206896552
1837453,2,B00008DDJE,You can not do this dvd without the exercise band and no where on the description did it say that would be not included. I had to buy it separatley after giving the dvd as a gift,1134345600,18,178,3.8378378378378377
1837454,5,B00008DDJE,"I absolutely love Leslie Sansone, but a lot of her DVDs can seem somewhat of a repeat of the previous one. This one is different and I am enjoying the strength training I am getting from it. It offers interval trainings of brisk walking and strengthening exercises to the gluts, thighs, triceps, biceps and more with the stretchie band. I love the intervals and find this a very satisfying and fun DVD!!",1114646400,66,403,4.611111111111111
1837455,5,B00008DDJE,"I have several of Leslie's videos and have worked out a rotating system.  While this one may not feel like much of a work out as you do it, the next day you can really tell that you have done resistance work.  As a result, I do a ""walk only"" one the following day.  It is also nice to have a few work outs that can be done in 30 minutes instead of an hour.",1109462400,37,356,3.72
1837456,5,B00008DDJE,"This is one of the first videos by Leslie that I bought. Before trying her tapes I did not exercise at all. I like that the Walk Strong focuses on specific muscle groups and also pumps it up a bit with walking exercises. You will sweat a bit and you will feel muscles all through your body when you are done. I also like it because its a 30 minute tape and you get a complete workout. The people in the tape doing the exercises with you are very approachable, and are not models. They look like real people. Leslie is very bubbly and encouraging. This is a good tape if you are beginning because you can start off slow. Its also good if you are more advanced because you can shorten the resistance band to make it harder for you. I also did this video with small hand weights when I did not have a resistance band. The ""Stretchie Band"" is around 8 dollars on Leslie's website. I think shes wonderful and I'e been exercising 5 days a week now for 2 months. You will definitely see improvement in your body and will feel great after working out with Leslie. I give this 5 stars. I can't wait to do her workouts at the end of the day. I also recommend the 4 mile super challenge ( walk away the pounds series) because it is really challenging. Its an hour long work out and really makes you sweat and you get some good cardio in there.",1105142400,49,1332,4.186770428015564
1837457,5,B00008DDJE,"Yes, you still walk and do the basic four steps, but you have intervals of strength training with the stretchie band.  Hand weights work just as well if you don't have a band.  Let me tell you, your muscles will be humming when you're done with this one!  My kind of strength training!  Thanks, Leslie!",1104969600,21,302,4.4363636363636365
1837458,2,B00008DDJE,"It certainly wasn't what I was expecting.  I thought I was going to get a GOOD WALKING video but in turn got more strength training with this stretchy band thing that I don't even have.  I didn't like how it began with walking only to stop walking and start toning.  I would have liked it better if it were strictly a walking video with walking all the time with added toning, not stopping walking while toning.  I don't much care for this one and I LOVE the other tapes I own but this one, I was disappointed.",1069459200,41,510,4.22680412371134
1837459,5,B00008DDJE,"I am a former couch potatoe.  I did not like exercise before I tried this DVD.  Leslie has motivated me to get up and move.  I like the results that I've gotten.  I've lost 10 pounds adjusting my eating habits and exercising five days out of the week.  I've noticed that my legs and upper back and arms have begun to respond to the toning exercises.  This is a miracle for me.  The best thing about it is it's do-able!  I can't do aerobics--I'm too clumsy.  But I've decided that I can do more exercise than I thought I could do.  My next challenge will probably be pilates.  But I won't abandon Leslie Sansone's tapes.  By the way, Leslie is not irritating, she comes off as a genuine, nice person with no diva qualities.  P.S. I'm sending a copy to my sister who has diabetes and is seriously overweight.",1060041600,81,806,4.328859060402684
