8653120,5,B00JPSYPFE,"Oh, man, this is possibly the litmus-test-of-a-lifetime. There are probably agencies (the kind which conspiracy theories are woven up about) that are studying this mutant masterpiece as a form of deprogramming and/or bliss enhancement through total sanity deprivation.

Yes, that means you must take the lonesome journey on your own. Should you find a partner who is willing to go all the way, count yourself fortunate AFTER the viewing, as in all likelihood, one or both of you may not survive the onslaught of drosstrophobic mind-erasing absurdity. The weak are many, their inheritance will be a bland serenity and a flaming golfcourse.

Frankly, I'm going in for a 2nd viewing. That's right, I watched this about 6 months ago and I'm still not certain of what I saw or how to spell my name. It was not only worth it, but I have to whet my curiosity and take my destiny to the next level. In preparation, I have a shortlist of requirements:

a. seatbelt on the easychair

b. levitation regulator

c. anticonvulsant

d. 2 walkie talkies (1 for each ear in case I lose ability to talk to myself)

The director/writer/producer/editor/star Mike Cartel also did the movie ""Pets"", another permanent jaw-dropper must-experience film (last time I checked it had gone out-of-print almost instantly and has been so for approximately ten years).

I was and still am delighted to see reviewers complaining about that epic. It's the lamb's pajamas, and everyone knows that sheep don't sleep.

The director does a Commentary on this DVD, and though I have yet to reach that stage in my development, it is reassuring that if and when (I have confidence) my metamorphosis reaches conclusion, I'll be choosing this feature on the menu with cocoon-flecked appendages.

Alternate scenes are included too! Vinegar Syndrome does it again and again and again and again. I would say something stupid like ""we are not worthy"", but I've said enough. They cannot be making very much coin from these releasescan anybody else smell labor of love?

I cannot honestly say I've loved everything they have released, but it's nothing short of astounding how many lost (or desired by about 25 people) cult movies they have mastered for disc and beyond (this one has a 4K restoration from the 35 mm camera negative and you could - and may - fall right into the motion picture image!).

Now to hunt down that anticonvulsant...",1528070400,,2392,4.908188585607941

8653123,5,B00JPSYPFE,"Working/living in Death Valley, worm ranchers Ralph and Jason quietly watch a live, luscious girl being buried. They rescue the victim, Fate (Seeska Vandenberg) but get kidnapped for their trouble by the buried girl's lunatical all-female cult. Jason (Al Valletta), originally bored, finds the abduction a feast with endless romantic opportunities while Ralph (Mike Cartel), content with the quiet, uneventful desert tries now to maneuver in a bizarre, dangerous otherworld. RUNAWAY NIGHTMARE is a serious mystery in the opening moments of ominous Joshua-treed desert with fleecy grinning clouds; vultures circling, restive winds , suggesting playfully cruel gods just over the horizon. But the audience is also foreshadowy-warned that this is a subtle, dark comedy; Worm farmers (really?) Calm one-liners, even wisecracks alongside morbidity. You also grasp that actor/director/etcetera Mike Cartel intentionally teases with almost-sex and near ultra-violence/death. Cartel avoids these conceits like the clap, partly to contrast the '70s cinema new discovery (and flaunting) of skin, sim-sex, blood-flood and profanity-for-dialog. And partly because of the film's nature; where (stark porn and/or blood-gushing) with gorgeous lunatics is both dangerous and (with Ralph's moral character) as passionless as watching dogs mate. Act Two is Ralph and Jason's surreal life in the man-hating/craving female commune, where the men have opposite experiences. Much involves the netherworld vignettes with its expressionist decor, creeping shadows, splashed/shaped lighting. Seldom do the scenes build and play out, although the focus is on a quick study of bizarre women in a funhouse/spook house without stalling momentum. It is also where much of the confusing subtleties are confronted with dialog-pieces rather than lengthy expositions. The aberrant editing (sideways with nuts-and-bolt edits), unpredictable events, Ralph's interchange in this off-beat sequence creates an impetus of its own. But it is here too that the audience must catch hold of Ralph, or the film will fail with no one to root for. With a script sentence that might have read; ""Fate's burial was the punishment of a crime boss (that she had previously worked with) after she had stolen from him a package-full of something priceless (platinum?),"" the movie makes a detour into crime melodrama. Here Ralph and Jason are used as decoys at the crime boss's warehouse while the cult leader, heartless Hesperia (Cindy Donlan) and her women steal back the mysterious package. The boss and his crew (who's nobody's fool) counterattacks Hesperia's Walden-Three where everyone escapes, except, of course Ralph. Adapting as fast as the gods can invent traps, Ralph sets a time-bomb and hides the platinum package before being probed by the boss at his hideout. The bomb actually explodes before Ralph gets eviscerated, saved by his own cunning, with help from the sneaky gods. But the audience may suspect Ralph is a slapsitck-less Lou Costello (where he sees actual monsters but no one believes him) playing to Jason's cocky, doubting Bud Abbott. You know that Ralph isn't going to die (any more than Frankenstein will hurt Costello). The gods aren't about to let their fool slip into eternal rest until they've had their fun. Ralph phones his ranch where Jason and the girls have escaped. But it is Fate who coincidentally answers the phone; she lies that everyone has died and drives to the exploded warehouse to find Ralph. It is only Fate after-all who appears sane, who had gingerly seduced Ralph into her trust. After learning the whereabouts of her platinum, Fate toys with Ralph by happily confessing to her triple-crosses then casually shoots the man who had saved her life. But Ralph still can't find deathly peace, this time saved by his protective vest. Now at the commune, Fate finally opens her illusive package, discovering that it actually contains something far more precious than platinum. This is where the original script ended, with a sketchy line about cult queen Hesperia abandoning her girls to the men, who happily use them as bug ranchers. Over the months Cartel filmed five endings, finally settling on one that takes another hard turn (gods-willing) allowing Ralph's escape into the kind of indelicate immortality that only a vampire might appreciate. RUNAWAY NIGHTMARE's comic subtlety, however overlaps into several genres (it was first marketed as a horror film) where it keeps many viewers off-balance or slaphappy (are they serious now? Where the hell is this leading to?) or degrades into farce (a hot-foot joke to end the dinner scene!?). But Ralph remains true to his character, and every mad hazard is seen through his POV, holding a forward interest with many observers intrigued, others overlooking flaws for the adventure. And if audiences go along with Ralph they will forgive that the plot is just a platform, slowly unfolding from a mystery into a raging, screwball ride that may have finally found its gathering, beyond the art house and into the outer limits of cinephile cult.",1423180800,4,5082,5.337905236907731
8653124,1,B00JPSYPFE,"Not borrowed from anywhere, but from actual eyeball viewing, unfortunately.

I can see that in individual scenes the Director was going for straightfaced, understated irony. Had the surrounding movie had any sort of intelligible plot that might have worked with the wooden actor chosen.

Unfortunately, whatever plot was intended got changed apparently at the whim of some sort of random device, possibly some sort of Magic 8-ball or Game of Life spinner. What emerges from over an hour of relentless filming of talent-free acting in uninteresting locations, utilizing the very cheapest special effects known to mankind is - Blither.

Now even I know that the only way you can get away with this sort of thing is by the liberal application of Gratuitous Naked Ladies, and apparently so did some mystery person because in the place where Deleted Scenes normally lurk there is some odd footage of which the Director explicitly denies knowledge, consisting of scenes from the movie intercut with headless naked female torso shots - no, not dead bodies, a body ""double"" whose head is cropped out of shot because she bore as much resemblance to the actress actually attempting to act the rest of the scene as the Caped Guy From Plan 9 bore to Bela Lugosi.

However, don't get your blood up because these scenes of gratuitous headless naked femaleness were removed from the movie so you could enjoy it as the Director intended you should - in an atmosphere of unrelenting tedium and horribleness. They weren't that good anyway.

This movie is an abject lesson in why you shouldn't attempt to make a movie if you don't have a firm idea of what it will be about, and why you shouldn't then edit the results while under the influence of mind-altering drugs, barely sub-lethal amounts of alcohol or alien psychotronic mind-control rays. I'm not sure which of those was responsible for Runaway Nightmare, but I can't think of any other explanation for the epic levels of blithering suck coming out of my TV set while the disc is loaded and running. Even Italian movies pale into insignificance beside this bewildering monstrosity.

Give to someone you hate, but hide it in a box for a different, more promising movie in case they've already heard of this one.

Runaway Nightmare

Way down on the list of films anyone ever Runaway Nightmareexpected to make the leap to Blu-ray sits Runaway Nightmare, an unclassifiable oddity shot over a period of years well into the early '80s but essentially unseen until it crept out on VHS in 1987, complete with mysterious spliced-in nude shots created by the distributor with different actors to beef up its commercial prospects. The bid didn't really pay off, but fans of oddball cinema took note and made the film a bit of an underground favorite passed around among collectors. Jump forward to 2014, and the film has been deemed worthy of a full-fledged special edition from Vinegar Syndrome complete with a limited (1,000 unit) Blu-ray/DVD combo and a general release DVD version. The mind boggles.

While out in the Nevada desert hunting for worms and catching a few rays, Ralph (director Cartel) and Jason (Valletta) stumble upon a wooden box buried in the sand. Inside it is an unconscious blonde woman who's been buried alive by two unknown men, so they toss her in their van and end up being kidnapped by a sect of female cultists. They're itching for some payback against the mob guys who buried one of their own, with a valuable suitcase full of platinum (or perhaps something else) at the center of their deadly squabble. Both of the innocent men end up held captive and inducted into the Runaway Nightmarecandlelight and black robe society, even turning into the women's sexual playthings. Botched escape attempts, possibly supernatural visions, and nonsensical conversations collide to produce a film so peculiar you literally won't know what to think from one scene to the next. Runaway Nightmare

Though you probably won't recognize too many names on the cast list, Runaway Nightmare sports a higher number of actual stunt people among its actors; that means you get a few unusually convincing violent gags along the way involving slugs and smashing glass. The two male leads both have other cracked drive-in titles to their credit, with Cartel appearing in Pets and Valletta helming Alley Cat, but nothing else really compares to this film; imagine a drunken mutation between The Candy Snatchers, Schalcken the Painter, and Kiss Me Deadly, and you're sort of in the right ballpark. Due to the fact that it was assembled over such a long period, it's also a crazy quilt in technical terms with some scenes looking surprisingly gorgeous (the film makes use of the color black in very effective ways at times) while others were seemingly constructed by asylum inmates. And we wouldn't have it any other ways. (P.S.: Be sure to watch through the end credits.)

Runaway NightmareFor its debut on any home video format since VHS, Vinegar Syndrome has restored the film back to its original form without the jarring shot-on-video T&A shots, which are still included as a separate extra if you're feeling nostalgic. The transfer looks terrific, not surprisingly, and you can finally make out what the heck's going on in some of the darker scenes that were utterly indecipherable before. Colors look strong, almost blazing at times, and the DTS-HD mono track appears to be an accurate reflection of the source material (including a song played Runaway Nightmareon a loop over the menu if the end credits aren't enough for you.) The seams in the original production are perhaps even easier to spot now, of course, but that's the price you pay in the modern era.

The other big extra here is an audio commentary with Mike Cartel, wife and production helper outer Mari Cartel, Vinegar Syndrome's Joe Ruben, and Destructible Man's Howard S. Berger, who cover the bumpy production process, the backgrounds of pretty much everyone who steps in front of the camera, and the creative intentions behind the funky fusion of movie genres. Be warned that some participants tend to move pretty far from the microphone, so be prepared to make some volume adjustments from time to time. If you've seen the film before, it's a stunning rehabilitation for a title lost in the tidal wave of '80s VHS insanity; if you've never even heard of it before, well... prepare for a very wild ride.",1403740800,,4511,4.974801061007957
