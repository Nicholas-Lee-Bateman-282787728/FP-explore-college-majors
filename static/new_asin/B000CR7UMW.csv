8101072,5,B000CR7UMW,"I purchased this DVD because there are not too many choices. I'm happy to report it has exceeded my expectations in every way. Objective and unbiased-man, woman, young, old, of any nationality... deep insight on everything that is Aikido or, into what we should all aim for in life - balance, individuality ... explanation of physics as applied to using 'brain, not braun...' - I'd say more, but all I can do is share that it is worth every penny; delighted I took the chance !!!

8101073,5,B000CR7UMW,"Your review is very much ill informed. It sounds like you did not bother to do research or even ask your teachers basic questions. Any Aikido Sensei would tell you that the average time to earn a blackbelt (which is indicates the mastery of the basics) in Aikido takes on average 4 to 6 years alone of proper training (This also depends on how often you train on your off time and how many classes you attended). Any Tai Chi Chuan Sifu would tell you in or about the same for Tai Chi. Each martial art were created for different conditions and purposes in mind. Neither Tai Chi Chuan or Aikido were created with speed of learning in mind. Heck Chen style Tai Chi was created in Chen farming village and to this day the same Chen family still teaches it. Farmers were in no rush to learn how to fight fast, thus training was not rushed either. The 'Path of least resistance"" as you call it just shows how little you know about soft and internal martial arts. Soft and internal doesn't always mean the path of least resistance as so much as how to generate power and how to guide the other's power where you want to best suit your defense and attack. Any traditional marital artist could tell you that. Your fellow students and even your teacher could have told you that if you had bothered to ask questions after class. Your review does show that you lack patience, this is not the fault of any martial art but more of an indication of lack of discipline. If your goal was to be able to use what you learned effectively in or around a year, if you would have bothered to do your homework you would have found some arts that fit that. Arts that come to mind are American Kenpo and Wing Chun kung fu. You are sadly misinformed about Karate. Karate has 110 recorded styles and they all very greatly in principles and tactics. Some styles of Karate, like the Japanese Shotokan style, do use hard and external power. This does imply brute force. Other styles like those from Okinawa, such as Shorin Ryu, Goju Ryu and Uechi Ryu have a balance of hardness and softness, when to borrow and deflect and when to explode with force. This is done very subtly. You would note the use of Kakie or pushing hands, which is the same as Tai Chi push hands in purpose. Wing Chun uses Chi Sao, or sticky hands to achieve the same goal. Tai Chi actually is a balance of hard and soft. As training progresses the goal is to be in the middle of hard and soft. Goju Ryu is the same in purpose as in Japanese 'Go' means hard and 'Ju' means soft. Goju ryu is the hard and soft style but they start with hard principles and progress to soft as time goes. Thus they start from the opposite end of where Tai Chi starts but they both journey to the center to balance this aspects. Aikido does not work with brute force, many Aikido students who had the discipline to stick it out can tell you this. Steven Segal doesnt use brute force, he knows how to blend and redirect the energy of the attack and use that against the person. Speed is find but Morihei Ueshiba, O' Sensei, did have speed but he did not lack strength. If you would have stayed with your training you would have gotten stronger. Even in this DVD some of these masters tell you Aikido made them stronger. But Strength doesn't equate to brute force. Knowing to blend and redirect energy takes time, espeically with an art that has 3200 techniques with several variations for each. Do you honestly think you can learn the basics effectively in a year with that much material? No one can. In contrast you can look up American Kenpo or Wing Chun. Both arts have less than 200 techniques for the entire system as both were created to learn fast, Shorin Ryu is also that way. You won't know the entire system in these arts but you would be able to defend yourself effectively in or around a year easily. As kicking and punching are more natural but they also know how to borrow and deflect force rather then use brute force head on. They do it in very subtle ways. Someone trained well would know the difference. So the only thing I ask you to do is do your homework, talk to your teachers and ask questions. If you don't you will always be a poor student and will always struggle. And will always have their behind handed to them on the street (God forbid). That's no one's fault but yours. If you are unable to distinguish hard from soft, internal from external then you didn't learn a thing. And finally this DVD was not a beauty contest. Not to mention beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This DVD was made to show women masters of Aikido. These women are highly skilled. This DVD delivered. I am sure if any of these Masters were to throw you across the room and have you land on your face their appearance would be the last thing you would need to worry about. Good day.",1454284800,,4807,4.3481646273637375
8101074,5,B000CR7UMW,"This is the only DVD of its kind that I know of.  It is a series of interviews with women who have reached black belt or teacher level in Aikido.  Not only is it very interesting and informative, showing various approaches to Aikido and how each woman approaches her training and teaching, but it also shows clearly how each person's style varies.  As a woman doing Aikido I found it very helpful and interesting, as I struggle to find my own style and expression in a sport dominated largely by the male expression of the art.  A male friend of ours who runs his own dojo also found it very helpful because he could relate first hand to the journey of the teachers and the struggles they experienced in setting up and establishing a dojo.  He also found it insightful because it gave him a deeper understanding the struggles that females have in developing and expressing the art.",1376784000,5,881,4.550632911392405
8101075,5,B000CR7UMW,"An unexpectedly inspiration! In spite of the recent Hollywood stereotype of sexy women with Ninja skills I think of martial arts as primarily the domain of men so it's refreshing to find real women practicing and teaching others Akido.  This video gave me insight not only into the practice of Akido but into my position in society as a woman in a leadership position.  I recommend this video for anyone, male or female, who wants to deepen their understanding of how this martial art offers not just a physical but a psychological training field.",1332892800,2,547,4.808510638297872
8101076,4,B000CR7UMW,"Normally I don't try to engage in debates with other reviewers, but as a person who has practiced korean karate, taijiquan and aikido for many of my nearly fifty years on this planet, I have to take issue with Mr. Hariman's comments, as well as his review of the DVD under discussion here.

While many tai chi teachers that emphasis health and well-being over fighting applications, I have met at least three who produced students that are more than capable of holding their own in a fight.  The same applies to aikido. While the emphasis in many dojo is on the art as a spiritual practice, I have met several aikido practitioners who are able to quickly take another's balance, and bring him or her under control (or simply throw them into a wall, if need be) - its' just that the development of fighting skill is not the only goal of practice.  While I would concede that both arts require at least a minimum of physical (as well as mental and emotional) conditioning before a student is able to apply the techniques of these arts at speed and under pressure, the student gains that conditioning (and builds the necessary skills) through disciplined practice (and rational analysis of technique) over time.

The thing is that this process does take time: if one is physically weak to begin with, one year of practice is not nearly enough to gain a fighting level of skill at either art (and I would argue that this goes for korean karate as well).  With all due respect, Mr. Hariman's review betrays a rather shallow understanding of the arts in question, as well as a desire for 'quick and easy' results.  I would suggest that he take the time to find a teacher that he can trust and have confidence in, whatever the art, and commit himself to three-five years of practice with an open mind, and see.  He might be surprised.

That said I enjoyed watching Malory Graham's documentary.  It presents a well-balanced view of the styles of practice and personal experiences of the senior women yudansha (black belt level practitioners) who studied the art under the major Japanese shihan (master instructors, like Yoshimitsu Yamada, T.K. Chiba,  and the late Mitusunari Kanai) active in the United States Aikido Federation over the past couple of decades.  if I had a criticism, it would be that the presentation would have benefited from discussions of the internal mechanics of receiving an attack and taking another's balance, or demonstrations of advanced modes of practice like kaeshiwaza (reversals), both of which may have gone a long way to allay the issues raised by skeptics like Mr. Hariman.  I share my copy with women students in the dojo I practice in, particularly beginners, for whom I hope it serves as a inspiration and a spur to more dedicated practice in these difficult times.",1326931200,10,2795,4.775933609958506
8101077,1,B000CR7UMW,"""Holding Up 10% of the Sky"" is a more appropriate title for this DVD rather than ""Holding Up Half the Sky"". If you look at my website [...] pages 3-4, you will see that I have had a weak composition all my life. Because of this, I am more interested in martial arts that rely on the ""path of least resistace"" like Aikido, and Tai Chi rather  than Karate, which relies on brute force. Unfortunately, after learning Tai Chi, 1 year, I find I am incapable of using it for fighting. The same thing happenned with Aikido which promises the applications based on Ki(c'hi), on the basis of least resistance. Conversation with friends and especially by looking at this DVD convinces me that Aikido will work only if :(1). you are extremely big and strong (like Steven Seagal) or very fast like Murohei Uyeshiba, where the speed will substitute for his strength. In my view it is misleading to say that Aikido proceeds on the basis of the path of least resistance. This DVD also has not disabused my long held belief that most masters of female martial arts are rather ugly. For example, none of  10 of the top pioneering women in Aikido is gorgeous and beautiful, in the ordinary sense of the words. I am happy to give this album 1 star.",1255305600,,1229,4.482142857142857
