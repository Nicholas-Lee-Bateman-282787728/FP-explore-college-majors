491401,5,6302666759,"Thousands of years ago, a forgotten empire vanquished their foes with a secret compound, but like all empires before or since, their civilization crumbled, their secret - encoded on a disk - was lost to antiquity ... that is, until 1933, when Professor Hargraves learns that half of that disk is hidden in a temple in China.  Unfortunately, China is in turmoil, fighting has broken out, bombs are falling, the temple could be destroyed at anytime.  Finding that disk is worth the risk of losing his life to find it; he just wishes he could keep his daughter Pauline out of danger. . . .

Unlike many cliffhanger serials, where only the hero or the heroine are in mortal danger, in this series, all are in peril of losing their lives, not only the good guys, but the bad guys as well.  Fearlessly, the good guys: Pauline, her father, her boyfriend Bob, and the bad guys: Dr. Bashan and Fang meet these dangers without a whimper; not so Professor Hargraves' wimpy secretary Willie Dodge; his fear is over the top ... and then some.

Danger can come from any quarter:  crumbling buildings, trap doors, fire, explosions, angry natives, and wild animals; before this quest is over, they see more animals than they'd see in a Tarzan movie. . . .

Aircraft buffs alert:  There is incredible footage of a giant passenger flying boat (Dornier Do X).  It has a huge broad rectangular wing with 6 engines mounted atop.  The footage shows it on takeoff, in-flight, landing, and an aerial shot of it sitting in the waters off of New York City.  (You can find a couple of photos of it on Wikipedia.)

Picture (DVD - VCI 2012): 3.5+, excellent contrast, rare flecking.  Sound volume: lower than most.  Subtitles: none.",1358985600,3,1703,4.6521739130434785

491403,4,6302666759,"Universal's twelve-chapter serial ""The Perils of Pauline"" from 1933 has little in common with the 1914 Pearl White classic, other than story writer Charles W. Goddard, who wrote the screenplay for the earlier serial.  Still, the ""remake"" is good for its time.  It was directed by Ray Taylor, with screenplay by Basil Dickey, Jack Foley, Ella O'Neill and George Plympton.

The story has Professor Hargrave (James Durkin) in China, seeking an ivory disk inscribed with an ancient formula for a deadly disintegrating gas, which years earlier he had promised his dying friend, the priest Confu, he would use to benefit humanity.  With the Professor are his daughter, Pauline (Evalyn Knapp) and his secretary, Willie Dodge (Sonny Ray), neither of whom are enthusiastic about staying in China, given that a revolution is in progress and the city is being bombed.  But the Professor explains that others have learned of the formula's existence, and it might fall into the hands of the evil Dr. Bashan (John Davidson).  He also observes that the revolution will make it easier to spirit the disk out of the temple where it is believed to be hidden.  As the Professor and Dodge leave the hotel, Pauline notices they are being followed, and in trying to warn them has to be rescued from Bashan's henchmen by an American, Robert Warde (Robert Allen).  They reach the Professor and find what they believe is the formula, but the hard disk crashed and only half of it is there, with instructions for finding the rest of it.  Bashan and his henchmen are waiting outside to steal the half disk, but are driven back when the temple is bombed, and have to spend the next eleven chapters following and causing trouble for the Hargrave party as they search many lands for the other half of the disk.

This is a fairly early Universal sound serial, with little background music, only mixed with spoken lines in a couple places.  And as in their later serials, Universal used a lot of stock footage, though most of it is well-edited into the action.  Some of this provides unintentional humor, such as in Chapter Five where a supposedly-dead leopard is clearly seen to be breathing, with the same clip used twice in Chapter Five, only a few minutes apart.  In Chapter Eleven, as fire engines race through the streets to one of Universal's favorite cliffhangers, we see not only cars that were ancient in 1933, but even a horse-drawn covered wagon.  There are a few ""continuity"" issues, including the Professor's last name, where both ""Hargrave"" and ""Hargraves"" are used in the spoken dialogue and titles.  But Evalyn Knapp looks good, and has more involvement in the action than most serial movie heroines of the 1930's.  She doesn't have the outlandish perils that beset Pearl White in the earlier serial, such as outrunning boulders rolled down the trail after her, just the more-usual kind of threats from wild animals, ancient death traps, and Dr. Bashan and his henchmen.  Our hero, billed as Robert Allen, had made several films under his given name, Hugh Enfield, and was later known as Craig Reynolds.  He makes a believable hero, and with James Durkin as Professor Hargrave avoids displaying more intelligence than their adversaries.  And no excuse need be given for our heroes looting temples for the formula, and rather indiscriminate killing of hostile natives; after all, they are on a quest to benefit mankind.  At least the question is raised as to how a disintegrating gas might do this, if the ""ultimate weapon to end all war"" answer has the kind of logic that brought about the atomic bomb.  Faulty thinking is also evident in the inclusion of Sonny Ray as the perpetually frightened ""comic relief"" character, if a standard feature in serials at the time.  It is more out-of-place than badly done, though used fairly well in Chapter Nine.  The main acting strength is with the bad guys, led by John Davidson in one of his best roles as Dr. Bashan, a boss you wouldn't want to make angry.  And Frank Lackteen as Fang does not always please his boss; one feels sympathy for him at several points when, after risking his neck, he must once again face Bashan with the news that he didn't recover the disk.

VCI's edition, # 6901, is on a double-layer DVD, quite adequate for the twelve chapters.  No ""extras"" are provided.  Restoration is credited to Film Chest Media Group, and the image is sharp, with excellent gray scale.  Only a few scratches and related ""dirt"" are present.  A couple places have some white speckles, probably from dirt on the negative, but otherwise there are only a few minor issues with the picture quality.  The clean-up was done a little too well, correcting some of the miserably-grainy stock footage, sometimes resulting in poor sharpness or leaving odd artifacts like vertical lines in place of the grain.  Slightly more serious, the image is sometimes enlarged by about 15 per-cent.  While carefully done so heads don't get cut off, in a couple chapters most of the last line of the recap text gets wiped out by the bottom of the frame.  But these issues are minor; it is still a glorious edition to watch.  Unfortunately the audio is another matter, where ""noise reduction"" has deleted desirable background sounds like footsteps and distant yells of pursuing hostile natives.  In some places the processing garbles the dialogue so it is hard to understand, especially in the first chapter where the sounds of exploding bombs are at full strength, yet the volume must be increased to hear what's being said.  In Chapter Ten, it is hard to believe that Fang, listening at a window, can discover the plans being made by Hargrave and Warde, when their discussion is hard to understand as heard from inside the house.  Other chapters don't have as much of the problem, and  I wouldn't want to suggest that the sound of the Alpha edition is better; it suffered from noise due to excess dynamic range compression, but the dialogue was usually fairly clear.

I won't detail here the defects of the Alpha edition, since Amazon is (for now) keeping the reviews separate, but even with with the poor sound, VCI's edition is a lot easier to watch.  There is a fairly-decent version from Sinister Cinema, which while lacking the clean-looking image has better framing, and fairly good gray scale.  It also has much better sound than either the VCI or Alpha editions, if with some background noise.  Still, a recommendation of the VCI release can be made, and it will amaze those who have suffered over the years with poor copies of bad prints of this serial.  And while the serial itself has some shortcomings common to films of its era, it remains entertaining, though best viewed one chapter at a time so the redundant stock footage isn't so obvious.",1336953600,15,6764,4.814878892733564
491404,4,6302666759,"This review is for the VCI Entertainment release of ""The Perils of Pauline"".

Strange!  When you open the Amazon page for this item, it says: ""The Perils Of Pauline (1914)"" and starring Evalyn Knapp.  But Ms Knapp was not in the 1914 version.  She was in the lesser 1933 version.

IMDB rates the 1933 version 6.1 stars, but the original 1914 version gets 7.4 stars.  That's the one I was hoping for.  Oh well.

Apparently, the original is only partially available as a shortened European release.  Guess I'll get that instead.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perils-of-Pauline-1914-Serial/dp/B000LY271A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perils of Pauline (1914 Serial)</a>",1334793600,3,708,6.142857142857143
491405,5,6302666759,"Well to begin with, it would be difficult for me to add a great deal concerning this film after reading the wonderful review on this page by J. Lovins. ""Mr Jim"" has pretty well hit the nail on the head with this one.

The Saturday afternoon serial was, in many ways, a semi-important part of life for many of my generation.  As far as outside entertainment was concerned, the movies were it...no T.V., no video, no computers, no nothing of that nature.  We had the movies and we had books.  Looking back, this was quite satisfactory and quite adequate.  A big part of the movie experience for little boys and girls in this era was the cliff hanger serial.  We followed these things week after week and again, looking back, it is surprising just how much of our conversation during the week, between episodes, addressed past episodes and speculated on future ones.

Our theater was located in a very isolated section of the country at that time, in a very small town.  We did not often get current movies and certainly did not get all of the current serials.  This was in the late 1940s and very early 50s.  A 1934 movie, such as this one is, was pretty new and for us and we felt lucky go get it.  We gladly plunked down our dime each Saturday afternoon to see it and the many, many others of this ilk.

The Perils of Pauline, the two tape set being reviewed here, was an absolute classic and sort of set the standard for such things at the time.  There was nonstop action, buildings falling down, kidnappings (good grief...kidnapping after kidnapping), evil bad guys, sticky sweet and heroic good guys, wild snakes and other critters and plenty of treasure hunting.  Above all though, was the danger faced by the heroine; Pauline!  This poor girl went from mess to mess, trouble to trouble and I swear, Pauline played by Evalyn Knapp, had one of the best screaming voices in the business, which was in constant use.  (Do note and do watch closely on this one...Evalyn Knapp played a part here, portraying a heroine who was in many ways far ahead of her time.  She was physically aggressive (she would shot a bad guy or animal or native in a second), had a sort of take charge attitude many times, and was far, far brighter (I am speaking of Pauline here) than her counter part hero and indeed, most of the male cast of characters.

Pauline's leading man, the number one hero in this series of stories was played by Robert Allen, was absolutely perfect.  Good looking, heroic, athletic, and to be quite frank, just as dumb as sled tracks...my kind of hero! His dimness was only trumped by her father's.

The supporting cast, both evil and good, all played their parts perfectly...the bad guys were really, really bad and the good guys really, really good.  There were no shades of gray in this offering.

A couple of things to note about this particular release:  In several episodes, the first two in particular, the background noise, in this case a major battle and revolution going on, can be quite distracting and due to the difficulties with sound management and technology at that time, makes the dialog rather difficult to hear, much less follow.  Secondly, many of the scenes are shot in dark areas; at night, in temples, dark streets, etc.  Lighting techniques were not what they were today.  This made the clarity of some of the action rather difficult to see and follow.  Third, the viewer must never ever consider grading this movie for accuracy of any sort; wrong animals in wrong countries, wrong ""native tribes"" in the wrong areas of the world and such stuff as this.  Forth, we have the almost blatant racial tone of the entire work. You must remember when the movie was made.  This was pretty standard for that time and place.

This film though is simply fun to watch.  Never mind the somewhat hokey story line, the horrid dialog at times, the less than stellar acting abilities of some of the cast and the rest and very primitive special effects.  Just set back and enjoy it and remember that these serials were a very important part of our entertainment history.
