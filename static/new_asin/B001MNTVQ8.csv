I have several of the DVDs from the bender ball line up and am happy with all of them.  If you do not have an actual bender ball and are just purchasing the DVD's you can substitute a childs ball that can easily be found at any walmart for around $1 ( 10"" ball usually already blown up in multiple colors and designs they are usually in a large net bin in the toy dept)",1399420800,,468,3.8645833333333335

Checked DVD and it was alright but I have nothing to store it in now. As far as DVD,  it was decent but not near the best pilates DVD. I have better ones then this already.",1364688000,,287,3.7666666666666666
8326593,5,B001MNTVQ8,"Bender Ball Pilates Evolution is a 30 minute exercise DVD. The general level of complexity is an advanced beginner Level pilates exercise level of difficulty. By that I mean that me (the beginner level) had trouble doing some exercises but could follow most. The exercises have two options which can make it more difficult.  The exercises use both the Bender Ball and Gliding disks.

Instead of using Gliding Disks, which are rather expensive, I am using OVAL furniture sliders which are identical to the gliding disks in every respect other than price&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waxman-4704095N-9-1-2-Inch-by-5-3-4-Inch-Reusable-Oval-EZ-Sliders-White/dp/B001W6Q4VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waxman 4704095N 9-1/2-Inch by 5-3/4-Inch Reusable Oval EZ Sliders, White</a>.  In majority of exercises (when only the toes or the heels rest on the disk, not the entire foot) you can also use ROUND furniture sliders which are more common and even cheaper. However when you need to rest your entire foot on the slider you feel the edge on the sole of your foot if you like to exercise barefoot or in socks only.

This is my third Bender Ball DVD, so I am very pleased with its level and clear explanations. I am doing this exercises after serious back surgery and 4 months of physical therapy. This DVD, along with Bender Ball strong back and Bender Ball method of Pilates, really helped me to add variety to my exercise routine.

The exercises are for the most part not so advanced that I could not do them and get discourage, yet leave me plenty of room to improve. This DVD does challenge me leaving me frustrated that I am not able to follow the exercises. I found that I really like using the ball. It provides extra stretch that I would not be able to achieve without it. And in some exercises provides support that lets you do the exercise in a correct manner.

After the 30 minute work out my back feels nicely stretched, I can balance better and feel more nimble. I recommend this DVD to beginner level exercisers and especially people after back surgery like myself.",1309824000,2,2117,5.1395348837209305
