7887362,2,6305310726,"Despite the presence of three strong kung fu stars (Philip Ko, Leung Kar Yan, Wang Lung Wei), FEARLESS DRAGONS (real title: TWO ON THE ROAD, 1980) is just a bit too comical and lighthearted to please hardcore kung fu fans. However, it's worth seeing almost entirely for the last ten minutes when two of the stars take on the third in a splendid no-holds-barred battle shot at a roadside clearing. Philip Ko (aka Kao Fei) and Leung Kar Yan play two drifters who wind up, in a most contrived manner, working together to try and track down a huge sum of stolen money collected for refugees by a local merchant (Wang Lung Wei). There is more than meets the eye to all three of these characters and, in the case of the heroes, crucial information is withheld until the very end that would have explained their actions. Without that info, there's little reason to understand their motivations. It would have been more suspenseful if we-the audience--knew more than the characters do. Genuine suspense is sacrificed for a cheap surprise late in the film. The poor quality edition available on DVD doesn't help a film that's already shoddily produced and badly photographed. However, the three stars are all in great form and their fans will rank this as a minor effort but worth seeing anyway.",1057276800,,1286,4.745535714285714
7887363,5,6305310726,"Two wanderers team up hoping to clear their names in a robbery case in which they were mistakenly accused (phillip ko, leun kar lang).  But no matter what they do it seems they only get deeper into trouble.  With their fine tuned kung fu skills the two men attempt to take down the real bandits.  Shocked to see who the mastermind behind it all is, the two share their own secrets as well.  Amazing fights and some great comedy.  Be amazed by Leun Kar Lang's Dragon fist, and Phillip Ko's Horse fist (Spectacluar).  Truly a Kung Fu Classic.",990230400,2,540,4.459183673469388

There is a very intense fight at the end with Wang Lung Wei.",984787200,,277,4.914893617021277
