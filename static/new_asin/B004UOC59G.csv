8441924,2,B004UOC59G,"After having just viewed this UK release in so called Bluray(or so it is supposed to be), I am very disappointed in the quality of this disc. I get the feeling that this was NOT remastered from the original 35mm film the movie/pilot was filmed in, but, it looks moreso to be a freshening up of a VHS tape. This version is not even US pan/scan 1.33:1 (keeping in mind that PAL is a different format). The sides have been slightly cropped so the image on the screen is not as full as the US pan/scan version. If supposedly a Bluray release from the original tapes why wasn't the mastering done in 1.78:1? I suppose that the big giveaway that lends to a no-name copy is the omission of Universal's lead-in logo. All major theatrical releases have the studio lead in logo on the front end of the movie, on this one there is nothing at all. I come away thinking that if Universal ever decides to release a genuine Bluray do a remaster of the US release (pilot for the series). There is almost 12 minutes missing from this version that is included in the US version. Most of what is missing is at the end of the film, a few clips early in the movie plus the needed scene in the middle of the movie where Hawke & Dominic leave the cabin together (making up an excuse to Gabrielle)to *check-in* on the flying production on the *Belasarius* set, but in fact they are scouting the desert to find a safe place to keep the copter. That is an important portion of the film as it explains where the stolen helicopter will ultimately be hidden by Hawke, but it is completely omitted from the film. I feel that the US release needs the Bluray treatment, adding in some of the UK clips to make the overall movie even more complete. For those who remember the series pilot this UK film will just leave you left in your seat, looking for that which has ultimately been left on the cutting room floor. Big letdown.",1322611200,5,1894,4.353107344632768
