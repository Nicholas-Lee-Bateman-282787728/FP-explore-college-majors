8135673,4,B000H0MKNI,"I am particularly partial to movie where food plays a central role in the story line  (i.e. Babette;s Feast, Big Night, Eat Drink Man Woman, Simply Irresistible etc.) .  This is a light comedy about a relationship between a chef and a woman who sells beer for a living.

I added this DVD to what I call my ""food movie collection"" because it is fun to watch.",1267660800,,357,4.298507462686567
