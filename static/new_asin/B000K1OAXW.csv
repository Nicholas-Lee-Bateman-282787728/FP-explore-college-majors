8153886,5,B000K1OAXW,"The source of this and several dozen more great videos on Disney Theme Parks can be found at his site Extinct Attractions. I personal have at least 25 of his productions. The one reader is right, these are not Disney created (I guess after 50+ years Disney hasn't gotten around to finding time to make thier own) and again they are made using SOME short clips of 8mm and other home footage but they are not made fully with these media. Now with that said, I have yet to find collections on the market so complete in Disney history and with such detailed inside info as these DVD's have. The old footage that was refered to in the one review helps talk to the history of the rides....Unfortunately disney didn't record every part of their rides/parks/attractions with plans to use them in the future as historical pieces. The great thing is people have recorded their vactions and David Oneal uses clips of the videos spliced together to help provide the full story. In no way does he try to act as a major studio but in the same instance all the info is well researched and he uses his video (Pro-Am I believe) Camera to capture as much as he can as well including the interviews.

These DVD's he releases are what most Disney fans are looking for:
Info
Behind the Scences
Inside story
Interviews with the creaters
and Little known facts

The DVD collection started out trying to document rides long gone by now that Disney wasn't to motivated to document themselves before they ripped them down. These DVD's and his others sold were good enough to get interviews by Imagineers new and old as well a Roy Disney. I see this as a ringing endorsment to the product. The Disney company has even just recently bought into the product granting behind the scence and archive access. While his begins to document old long gone rides started out crude the new videos are vastly improved from his start over 100 titles ago (he now has over 110 titles). The quality and depth is always improving and he even revists the old titles from time to time and improves them with better clips, new interviews, and new material when found.

Yes, you can wait for the Disney Company made product to come out, but I guess I'll be long gone before I'll see them release a ride specific disk.

Take my advice try a few...you won't regret it.",1198972800,,2317,4.535885167464115
8153887,2,B000K1OAXW,"Unless I missed something or was just hoping for the best, it wasn't actually made all that clear to me that this was not a Disney-produced DVD. I was somewhat startled to see a lot of 8mm or Super 8 home movie quality clips throughout, and although the Disc One main piece (featuring interviews with Rolly Crump, X Atencio, Thurl Ravenscroft, and some very nice clips of Walt Disney from ""Wonderful World of Disney"" before the Manison opened) is nicely done, most of the extras on Disc Two are terrible quality, particularly the Ruth Buzzi/Sandy Duncun ""robbery"" piece, as well as the television special, featuring 3 young boys who brave the ride.

The Disc Two interview with Rolly Crump is also somewhat tedious -- not only because of poor sound from Rolly (the interviewer is very well ""miked"" - so why not Rolly?) and obvious lighting issues (apparently, they decided to start the interview before the camera or lights were ready to go), but I also didn't get much out of Crump's rambling about his home decor and other non-fascinating, non-Disney/Mansion-related facts.

On Disc 1 there are some good (yet very short) sequences of Imagineers working on the ride and set pieces, which I was hoping there would be far more of, hence my reason for purchasing the DVD.

Overall, it did not fully satisfy what I expected to be a full documentary about the attraction, but I think the filmmakers deserve at least some credit for  pulling together what they could on a ""home made"" scale.

Of final mention: This is the first time I have ever received an unsealed DVD via Amazon, but after noticing that the DVD cover (under the sleeve) appears to have been made off a home computer (and also apparently hand-trimmed, as a portion of the sleeve was cut-off -- I would guess due to a misfire on a home paper-cutter?) -- I realized from the outset, even before inserting the DVD into my home player, that this was not going to be a studio-quality experience. The overall product is probably two-times -- possibly three-times -- pricier than it should be.",1172793600,14,2050,4.73109243697479
