4707729,5,B005I0DUN6,"I bought this for my 4 year old son, after watching it three times he got it and didn't want to watch it any more. Am I little disappointed he doesn't want to watch it over and over? Yes.  Am I even more elated that he learned every single thing these videos teach in less than one week? Heck yes!  He got it and that's all that matters to me. Now, when he forgets a letter sound, I just ask him what did they do in the movie and he proceeds to pop-pop-pop or wh-wha- what, lol! These videos are worth every penny and make me question the costs of daycare that couldn't teach him this as well as these videos.  I plan on purchasing more of the leapfrog collection and hopefully my son will be reading before he starts kindergarten. On a side note, my 18 month old is also benefitting from the collection as she is also learning with her big brother. Thanks Leapfrog,you make learning fun & affordable.",1327190400,33,901,4.257309941520468
4707730,5,B005I0DUN6,"Our kids love these videos.  They are educational and entertaining.  These are worth purchasing, since our 4-year old watches them over and over again.  Some movies the kids only want to watch once (which are better for rentals).  These Leap Frog videos get multiple viewings, and since they help learn alphabet, spelling, numbers, etc., they are good additions to our DVD shelf.",1325894400,,379,5.064516129032258

4707743,2,B005I0DUN6,The DVD included in this 3 pack titled Learn to Read Storybook Factory is of such poor visual quality that it is not useable. The image is blurry and has tracers. I can't return it now because I bought it before school started and just tried playing it for my kindergarten kids in class. I would warn anyone buying DVDs from Amazon to test the DVDs right away for quality. I just didn't think I would need to do that from Amazon as the seller.,1506816000,,443,4.223529411764706

The Amusement Park is a good one also, but it only teaches the letters not the sounds.

It's been a good while since grade school, but I don't believe that standard has changed has it? I just feel it is a conflict since I have been teaching her ""upper and lowercase"", she's two and I don't want this to cause any confusion for her.

From a parent's perspective, this was the best purchase ever. Our son isn't in preschool and so we feel a lot of pressure to get him ready for Kindergarten, but he really hasn't been interested in the games we have come up with. He watches the Leap Frog videos over and over and over again. He has his own names for each video and requests them ahead of many of his Disney and superhero movies.

Best part, of course, is that he has clearly learned quite a bit from them and correctly identifies many letters, numbers, and colors now.",1392422400,8,712,4.345864661654136

Little things like animating the characters lips and tongue properly as they pronounce letters and words really impressed me as well as far as little details.

Had to give myself a break from the other three after him asking to watch them repeatdly every day on teh way to and from work for a couple of weeks. Out of this new series he loves the amusement park video. He isn't too keen of the other two it seems. Says the shark one scares him. After both series he can now identify and sound out each letter.

4708003,5,B005I0DUN6,"My son just recently turned 5 and is very good with math and science for his age but was way behind on his ABC's and general language skills. I bought this set for his birthday and after a couple of views over the course of ONE WEEK he now knows his entire alphabet and EVERY letter sound!! I am beyond thrilled at his progress. He is now spelling his name with confidence every day. I cannot recommend this set enough!

The Letter Factory DVD is absolutely brilliant. It showcases every letter in a fun, entertaining way. It teaches how each letter sounds. We have watched this one the most because I really wanted my son to learn his letters.

The Talking Words Factory is equally brilliant in that it teaches vowels in a way that is particularly memorable. It explains how words are formed, how rhymes are made and much more. Again, this one is great for parents too because it's actually entertaining for adults as well as children. Leapfrog uses a goofy, lighthearted approach that doesn't come off pushy or boring.

The Kindergarten DVD isn't as excellent as the first two but it does cover a LOT of ground for what a child can expect in school.

Extremely happy with my purchase. My son was having such a hard time with his letters and now he looks forward to going over the flashcards, re-watching the movies and is walking around the house pointing out letters and trying to write and spell things on his own.

8474098,2,B005I0DUN6,"I just received this collection today... but one of the DVDs was missing (Learn to Read). It was definitely new in box and completely sealed when I opened it (both the box and the DVD case), so I'm not sure what happened. I'm not going to return it because my son was so excited to watch the others that I didn't want to pack it up to send back. Pretty disappointing.",1527811200,,367,4.183098591549296
