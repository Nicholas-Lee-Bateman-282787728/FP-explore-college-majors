1260861,2,B00003BE14,"The only people that cared about this movie were the artists.  The voices sucked, lacked talent, and at times sounded like they were mocking the script.

The story had potential... the actors and actresses just ripped it apart though.  Try re-recording it with.... some talent, some emotion, and try to realize that even though yer staring in a cartoon... grown folks will be watching it, not little kids... unless people let their kids watch this stuff.",1105660800,6,454,4.947368421052632
1260862,2,B00003BE14,"From the back cover: A Destiny Betrayed

A woman warrior named Aiko rises to power in a violent and bloody crusade. Haunted by memories of another life, she travels backwards in time to solve the mystery of her past... and finds herself caught in an incredible battle to save the future!

This story actually starts with a good idea, but does not amount to anything further than that because of a overly complicated story and an over excess of crazy sex. Hans, leader of a band of young crusaders is betrayed by the Pope in the year 1212, thus losing his faith in God. Becoming a fallen angel, Hans is reborn as Aiko 700 plus years later. In an attempt to save his/her friends in the past, Aiko travels back in time to save them. However, in the past Hans and Aiko are being hunted by a demonic woman who can manipulate time and people; choosing Aiko's long lost lover to help her in her scheme. All this and more packed into two 45 minute episodes. Take a chance with it if you want, but i would not suggest it.

Rated 16+ for a lot of nudity/sex/rape, violence and some language.",1058745600,49,1081,4.3681592039801
1260863,2,B00003BE14,"Um, I think of this and say, ""What the hell was that""
This was a story unlike anything i have seen. and quite frankly i never want to see it again. I got the dub version, and the voices stunk. then the script was horrible too. that didn't make a very good movie.",999302400,4,262,3.9622641509433962
7916941,5,B00003BE14,This is an anime based on past events but it has been altered. This has little fun & not that funny. But there is some action here with guro. But it had  messages about religions in the beginning here there is no religion.,1374710400,,222,4.162790697674419
7916942,5,B00003BE14,The DVD I ordered was in perfect condition like it was new. No damages and scratches the CD and the case. A great purchase from a trustworthy seller. Thank you so much.,1246147200,,168,4.28125
7916943,1,B00003BE14,"To be honest, this series made my head hurt. Too many conflicting flashbacks, some unecessary nudity and slow moving episodes. I was glad to just get through it. The names weren't properly pronounced and the dubbing was monotone and horrible. This was definitely not my type of anime. There is a bit of shoujo-ai/yuri content in this anime as well for the shoujo fans who would like to take the risk. It was a good idea but that's all it really amounted to. Don't waste your money. There are better series out there worth spending money on.",1229126400,,540,4.577319587628866
7916944,1,B00003BE14,"This is a God hater movie.  The acting is bad, plot horrible and over all
I wouldn't wish for anyone to waste their time watching this movie.  This is the First DVD I have ever throw away in my life.",1209945600,,199,3.95
7916945,1,B00003BE14,"In summary, during the 13th century's holy crusades, an innocent soldier finds himself betrayed and leaps to his death,vowing to return as a fallen angel and [so said so done] as he is reborn in the modern age as a female warrior. His feminine alter ego, the beautiful Aiko, rises to lead an army that unites the world and abolishes religion. But haunted by memories of a past life, she/he travels back in time [not sure how] and gets caught in a battle to save the future. In my humble opionon, do not waste your time on this horrible, horrible, horrible anime flim. I hardly ever watch anime, and don't know all that much about it. But even with that limited knowledge, I know that this one is bad. The plot is confusing and weak, the art is bad, the script is downright idiotic, and it can hardly qualify as hentai. The sex - give me a break! I've seen better on network television and soap operas! Terrible. There is nothing to recommend this film to anime fans or casual watchers. Don't bother.",1193529600,3,999,4.46448087431694
7916946,3,B00003BE14,"What most people don't know about this, is that that is the second in a series!  The first part of it is before the Restoration, and actually starts when Hans loses his wings.  I haven't been able to find the original in a long time, but I've found that this DVD makes a lot less sense without the first VHS.  I don't know why they released the second to DVD without remastering the first.  I will admit, I didn't enjoy this one as much.  I thought the first was much better.  This one was a little more confusing.",1144195200,11,514,4.1938775510204085
7916947,1,B00003BE14,"O.K., so there's a woman warrior, who led a crusade of other women warriors, and women took over the world (as if they haven't already, ba-dump-bump). And then there's a time-traveling demon, a convenient ""time tunnel"" built into an ancient monastery, a transsexual/lesbian love affair in there somewhere, and...you know what? Forget it. No, really, forget it; forget that this movie ever existed and move on to more comprehensible fare, like ""Urotsukidoji"". My rating: 1/10.",1133481600,4,475,5.346666666666667
7916948,3,B00003BE14,"In the Post-Restoration world, Yuki recovers her memory and realizes that her lover, Daisuke, died in the World Restoration, which was led by Aiko and the female crusaders of St. Michaela's College. She decides to save Daisuke by preventing the WR, which means going back in time to kill the Christian Crusader's.",1127174400,2,313,5.038461538461538
7916949,1,B00003BE14,"The voice acting is horrid.  All this movie has going for it is gratuitous sex, but not much of that either.  The plot could use some work, but if you're looking for a hentai, you're not likely looking for plot.  The story confusingly jumped between different time periods.",1112486400,8,273,4.645833333333333
7916950,2,B00003BE14,"We've all had our VHS bargain-bin experiences, but if I were not blessed with an appreciation for the bizarre and absurd I'd have tracked the vendor down and made them sit through it.  It would have been far worse punishment than a refund of 5 bucks, I assure you.

Indeed, the best reason to own this is to show it to other hentais, to see them gape in disbelief, struck dumb to decided if they'd just been ripped off by a delirious hack or mocked by a burned out malcontent...and don't even try to figure out if the writers were actually religious.

I've no idea if an original language viewing would make this somehow 'better', as the utterly, and typically, awful English cast added to its stupefying effect.",1111536000,11,712,4.546875
