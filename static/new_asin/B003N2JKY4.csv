4156486,5,B003N2JKY4,"It was amazing that such an old television program could be viewed so many years later in such clarity.  Packing was good and receipt of the DVD was timely.  Love the basset hound, Cleo, she brought back many fond memories.",1383436800,,223,4.55

4156488,5,B003N2JKY4,Who could hate that adorable puppy Cleo?  Or Jackie Cooper?  Or his aunt?  Or their trailer?  People's Choice is the easy going kind of comedy I wish we saw more of in these egocentered days.,1379030400,2,191,4.371428571428571
4156489,5,B003N2JKY4,I was very pleased with this dvd and its a wonderful little show just as good as I remembered it from years ago. Jackie cooper was always good in anything he was in. Also it was delivered very promptly.,1376092800,,202,4.205128205128205
4156490,5,B003N2JKY4,Cleo keeps you entertained and Jackie Cooper is likeable in his tense situations.  It makes for a good sample with its four episodes.,1366934400,,133,4.782608695652174
4156491,5,B003N2JKY4,"This DVD contains only four episodes from the first two of the three seasons of the 1950's sitcom that starred Jackie Cooper. It was a funny and charming example of its genre and despite the age of the series, holds up well. I remember watching this series in syndicated reruns and was one of my favorites then, and I'm glad to see my memories haven't failed me. Funny is still funny despite the decades that have passed.

The first episode, ""An Episode of Sock,"" introduces the character of Sock (short for Socrates), just home from the Army, his Aunt Gus, and his basset puppy, Cleo who is destined for stardom in the rest of the series.

The other three episodes included on the DVD seem to have been chosen at random from the first two seasons. The jump from one episode to the next could be confusing for those not familiar with the storylines of Sock's attending college, courting the mayor's daughter Mandy despite her father's disapproval, their secret marriage, the marriage's eventual reveal, and Sock's obnoxious Army buddy who can't take a hint he's overstayed his welcome. The episode titles are: ""Sock Gives Gus Away,"" ""Mandy's Male Animal,"" and ""Reluctant House Guest.""

The transfer to DVD is typical of other DVD editions of 1950s-era shows and is of acceptable viewing quality.

So now the big question is, when will a Complete Series set of the show become available? I'd be one of the first in line to pre-order it!

Recommended for those who enjoy well-written, well-acted classic sitcoms, fans of Jackie Cooper, and dog lovers.",1365206400,8,1549,4.80827067669173
4156492,5,B003N2JKY4,This was so much fun watching this funny series again! Gave it as a gift also and that was loved also.,1356912000,,102,3.9047619047619047
4156493,5,B003N2JKY4,"Wonderful show, enjoyable to watch. Good clean family show and the dog is wonderful. Jackie Cooper was wonderful in anything he did.",1315526400,6,132,5.045454545454546
4156494,5,B003N2JKY4,"I have fond memories of this show, our whole family gathering together to watch this show, and others. I was about 7 or 8, and I roared with delight every time Cleo, the dog, said something to criticize the behavior of the humans. Watching the dog drag it's sideways butt across the floor was also amusing. This is something you can show to your kids, and your kid's kids. A great sitcom, and Jackie Cooper and Patricia Breslin had a chemistry that has rarely been equalled. We MUST have more available episodes, while those of us are still around can appreciate them.",1312502400,4,568,4.578431372549019
4156495,5,B003N2JKY4,"Jackie Cooper had a great personality & sense of humor.  I only remembered him from The Little Rascals.  I'd heard of The People's Choice with the talking dog, but never got to see it until it became available through this offering.

I have to say I was highly entertained & found Jackie Cooper enchanting & very pleasant to watch.  Cleo who is almost as adorable comes a close second.  I never knew Mr. Cooper had done a series as an adult where he was a weekly performer.  He handled the part beautifully.

I only wish MORE of this series were available.

If this were to ever get released as full season sets, I'd buy them up as I'm sure many others would.

Perhaps we can make inquiries to Alpha Video regarding future installments?",1304208000,16,736,4.473684210526316
