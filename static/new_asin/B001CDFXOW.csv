8326301,2,B001CDFXOW,"I really regret wasting my money on this video. Now I have not tried other videos by this instructor but based on this one I won't be. I felt more effort was made in creating a slick MTV style production than an effective workout video that non dancers could follow. Now I'm putting myself in the beginner category, I recently started working out again after 5 years being lazy. While being out of shape I am an ex- dancer and even if I can't follow all the moves the first few times, I can recognize a good instructor. I felt she was more into presenting her image than actually teaching the moves. Now part of the fault is with whoever shot this dvd, the camera didn't seem to understand where it was supposed to focus. When she was teaching upper body, they showed her legs, when she was teaching footwork, they focused on her upper body. This is definately not a video for anyone who isn't currently a dancer. I have found way better hiphop aerobic videos than this one, by way better instructors.",1362960000,,1001,4.445652173913044

Gloria Araya-Quinlan has become a recent favorite instructor of mine, and I've been trying out several of her Tru2form DVDs.  I really enjoyed her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tru2form-Reggaeton/dp/B000BCXZWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tru2form - Reggaeton</a>&nbsp;and was expecting to have a great time and get a good workout with this DVD.  Unfortunately, it was quite different, having several flaws that kept it from being an effective workout.

The set was probably the quirkiest thing about ""Urban Heat.""  I don't think a construction site, complete with a ""Danger: High Voltage"" sign, is exactly the atmosphere I imagine working out in.  That fact that a taxi and random stop sign were in the background didn't seem very hip hop dancey at all.

However, the set doesn't determine how the workout is.  The instructor and her choreography are the true determining factors, and while I've liked Gloria in everything else I've seen her in, she was a bit too fake in this workout.  She seemed to be trying to hard to attain a ""cool"" swag/hip hop factor and make the workout like a music video.  That's not necessarily a bad idea, but the execution left much to be desired.  The camera was all over the place yet never at the right place.  When Gloria would be teaching a new upper body move, the camera would focus on the feet and vice versa.  I've reviewed many fitness DVDs, and this is first time I've ever complained about camera work.  It was bad.  On the other hand, the music was pretty good and didn't bore me.

As for the actual moves that Gloria taught, they were authentic hip hop moves and would be a blast to dance if only Gloria wouldn't teach them so badly.  She breaks down every single move (no matter the level of difficulty) really slowly and does it like that for about 4 times to make sure you have it.  While these moves were intricate, they weren't necessarily high impact and needed to be done up to tempo back to back in order to give a decent workout.  My heart rate never really got high because Gloria kept slowing things down for unnecessary amounts of times.

The format of the DVD is that after a warm-up, there are about 5 different combos (each with a different unique name) which each last about 5 minutes that Gloria will teach you one step at a time.  She will break down a move, like I said earlier, and add on one move at a time.  The moves need a generous amount of room to move...probably around 8 steps side-to-side and 4 steps forward.  Everything is probably what I'd classify as intermediate, although the constant slow-down makes the moves beginner friendly.  You end the workout with a cool down, which isn't very good; there aren't many stretches.

Overall, it's not the worst workout I've ever done, but it definitely needs some improvement.  The way the moves are taught isn't that great, and the production is a little strange; however, the moves are authentic and fun to master.  I'd recommend getting the Reggaeton DVD above this one, or if you're specifically a hip hop workout, I'd recommend either&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-Fitness-for-Beginners-with-MaDonna-Grimes-Urban-Street-Heat/dp/B0006H31SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance Fitness for Beginners with MaDonna Grimes: Urban Street Heat</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Hip-Hop-Dance-Mix/dp/B002ASVYOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Hip Hop Dance Mix</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-Off-the-Inches-Cardio-Hip-Hop/dp/B003QLEARE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance Off the Inches: Cardio Hip Hop</a>.  Unfortunately, I'm afraid that the bottom line is I don't really recommend this workout because there are so many better ones on the market.  I probably won't do this DVD again for a long time.",1334620800,,4049,5.591803278688524
