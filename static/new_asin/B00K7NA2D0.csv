8656578,1,B00K7NA2D0,"In the Heat of the Night, bar none, is the most realistic depiction of the American south ever presented on television. Starting with Tibbs' truth to his wife Althea that ""in the north, the white man doesn't care how big you get, just don't get too close; in the south, the white man doesn't care how close you get, just don't get too big."" The shows about multicultural relationships and how they were treated, issues about white privilege vs. white poverty ring too true.

However, I am constantly amazed that the episodes of the show I love the most are consistently missing from the box sets of these shows. My Tuesday nights of watching Law and Order and In the Heat of the Night back to back were, for me, ""Must-See TV."" I know every episode of this show. Too  much is missing. Bring out a complete set of this series!!!!!",1484352000,,828,4.47682119205298
