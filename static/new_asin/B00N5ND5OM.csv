8676418,2,B00N5ND5OM,"Manuscripts Dont Burn  Kino Lorber 2014 NR DVD version
This is a somewhat-fictionalized documentary from Iran about the suppression of independent journalism.  The back story is that Mohammad Rasoulof was sentenced to six years in jail in Iran for subversive film making.  While in jail he wrote the script for this film which is based on facts.  So, theres no clear distinction between what actually happened and what has been fictionalized, either to protect people or perhaps just to make the story more dramatic.  All the dialog is in Farsi, but there is good English subtitling available for an English-speaking audience.

OK so I can live with some uncertainty about where exactly the line is drawn between truth and fiction.  Perhaps its truthy as Steven Colbert might say, or more true than the truth as someone else said.  And I can live with sub-titling.  What I couldn't live with was the S L O W N E S S of this story.  I followed it a little more than halfway through [running time=126 minutes].  Actually I guess the director self-censored himself by too slow a script, doing the government of Iran an unintended favor as a result.  For all you who can actually finish two hours, I salute you.  I just couldn't put up with the slowness of it all.",1447113600,,1260,4.672727272727273

Arguably this is also happening in the States (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/first-amendment-free-speech-attack) but it seems much more subtle. Notably, we don't need surveillance vans; our smart phones are all too happy to oblige.",1427241600,,307,6.333333333333333

This is the first time a director is choosing a real criminal conspiracy of Iranian government against the elites and de-mask them as they are. Both side situation has been fairly, and truly looked. Very well-played and directed.",1415491200,2,351,4.866666666666666

8676426,4,B00N5ND5OM,"Yes this is a political thriller that `is based on facts', and as such will undoubtedly attract opposing views as to the value of the film. It tells the story of Khosrow and Morteza, who are employed by the state as sort of `cleaners'. They are to arrange the death of an intellectual and make it look like a suicide. Khosrow, has a young son who is in need of an operation that he can not afford. Mean time he has to go to `work' and leave his wife to deal with the familial crisis.

We also have the stories of the so called intellectuals, who have been fighting the system for ages. They have all suffered for their beliefs, but their failure to keep schtum means they are still enemies of the State. What transpires in a slow reveal of how far man will go to obey orders and what we as a society are prepared to accept, ignore or reject.

This film is slow in places, the lack of action is not helped by the lack of any music what so ever. This means that what happens on screen has to be good enough to hold your attention, and for the most part it is. There is action, violence and some `upsetting' scenes, but not too much that has not been seen before, but it is the casual cruelty that has the most effect..

The main thing is the way such low acts are incorporated as part of a States way of dealing with its own people and how easily they are tolerated. In Persian and a bit of French with a two hour run time. This, then, is an interesting film, that is well acted, well shot and probably well intentioned. It will though be seen as `controversial' and I for one think there is very little wrong with cinema challenging a few things so recommended",1412726400,6,1659,4.19435736677116
