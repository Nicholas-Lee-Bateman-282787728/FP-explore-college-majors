7973160,3,B00006SFKB,"Bruce Le, the notorious Bruce Lee imitator, made very few movies that were watchable, let alone good. This one, ""Ninja Over the Great Wall"" (the box calls it ""Shaolin Fist of Fury"") is one of his best. It's yet another movie in which Le has to fight the occupying Japanese Samurai in China pre-WWII, and there are times when it drags. However, it has some very memorable scenes (like the first ten minutes) and some above-average fighting, particularly in the Great Wall of China climax. It also boasts far higher production values than any other Bruce Le movie. All-in-all, if you only watch one Bruce Le movie in your life, you could do way, way worse than this.
The DVD from Ground Zero's Wu-Tang Clan line has the movie cropped to 1.33:1 (it was probably shot 2.35:1). The image isn't as bad as many budget releases, though - the colours are good and there aren't many scratches. The audio is dubbed, which will either delight or anger you depending on how you feel about dubbing. There are a couple of pretty-good extras, too, including some bonus fight scenes (from other Ground Zero releases) and some martial arts info.",1121212800,3,1127,4.696969696969697
