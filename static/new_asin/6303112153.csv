567935,2,6303112153,"I am a Hammer Film fan, but this one lacks the style and content that other Hammer films contain. The pop music song in the film ruins it. The poor use of Ralph Bates is evident and he could have been used much better as he is an excellent actor. I still enjoyed watching it but like I said, it lacks some.... The DVD quality is good though I am looking for Twins of Evil to be released on DVD. That is a better film!!",1009843200,2,418,3.929411764705882
567936,4,6303112153,"Lust for a Vampire is the second and generally acknowledged as the least of Hammer's Carmilla Karnstein trilogy (Vampire Lovers, Lust, Twins of Evil). The movie is actually better than I expected, with most of the downside apparently due to postproduction fiddling by producers Harry Fine and Michael Style. The script by Tudor Gates contains a few fresh twists, Jimmy Sangster's direction is competent, the women, especially Yutte Stensgaard as Mircalla, are gorgeous, and Ralph Bates is excellent in a difficult role (originally intended for Peter Cushing). But what really mars the film and no doubt contributes to its poor reputation are some shockingly bad editing and soundtrack decisions: an otherwise effective scene of three `vampiresses' stalking Michael Johnson in Karnstein castle is ruined by an idiotic voiceover; the unintentionally hilarious ""subjective"" murder shots were no doubt intended to be cut away from much sooner than they are; blatantly obvious, mismatched closeups of Christopher Lee's bloodshot eyes are substituted for Mike Raven's; Stensgaard and Johnson's big vampire attack/love scene is rendered completely ludicrous by an absolutely awful pop song (""Strange Love"") warbling in the background, etc., etc. The movie's quite watchable but frustrating because you keep thinking, ""if only Jimmy Sangster had been allowed to edit this it probably would've been much better."" (After saving Hammer's bacon by replacing injured Terence Fisher at the last minute, Sangster was unceremoniously ordered off the film by the producers as soon as shooting wrapped.) As it is, it's worth a look for Hammer and vampire fans, but ultimately less than completely satisfying.
Whatever one thinks of the film, you can't complain about Anchor's DVD package. The uncut, anamorphic widescreen (1.77:1) source print is a wee bit soft, but otherwise virtually flawless, with great color, contrast, detail, and nary a speckle to be seen. Extras include an equally gorgeous trailer, radio spots, poster and still gallery, filmographies, and a commentary by Jimmy Sangster, Suzanna Leigh, and Hammer historian Marcus Hearn. This is a real treat, since they spend most of the time discussing a wide range of personalities and topics, including some behind-the-scenes Hammer dish, rather than just focusing on the movie. Overall another fine release from Anchor, who've really been setting the standard for ""special edition"" DVDs lately, horror or otherwise. 5 stars for the DVD, 3 or 4 for the movie.",1008201600,68,2505,5.442159383033419
567937,4,6303112153,"Today, Hammer studio's the Vampire Lovers (an adaptation of LeFanu's Camille) is an erotic gothic film that could be easily shown on prime time TV (except for a bit of nudity) and is still a good piece of filmaking. However, Lust for a Vampire, which was rushed out by Hammer to cash in on the Vampire Lovers' success, is a more exploitative piece of schlock, but one that is nevertheless fun to watch.  An author arrives in a small town where women are being brutally murdered (the locals know it is a vampire, but he is too rational to believe this).  Much to his sinful delight, he finds himself with the opportunity to replace the professor of literature at a local all-girls academy where every student is gorgeous and they exercise outdoors in flimsy gowns and no underwear.  One of the students is a bisexual female vampire (who has a few sexy but very brief scenes with her roommates), and she and the author fall in love.  Alas, their love is doomed for they are from two different worlds.  The film is, by today's standards, also relatively tame and it gets a bit dull at times when the script attempts to become a more serious gothic thriller, but most of it is harmless exploitative fun with a self-depricating sense of humour.",1003968000,9,1239,4.588235294117647

567939,2,6303112153,"This is a good example of what British horror was turning into in  the early 1970's. Nudity was pushing to the front and stories were thinning out (no, not all, but those types of films were popping up more and more). It is hard to dislike a Hammer vampire film because they always seem to offer something. This film has the distinction of being the worst of Hammer's vampire films, although many will point to 7GV or SROV.  This was one of the three parts of the Karnstein trilogy and it is certainly the weakest and the most awkard. This film tries to be a horror romance, but has very little success due to a weak cast and a very strained story. I know Ralph Bates was a last minute choice because Cushing could not do it, but they certainly needed someone younger. Bates seems funnier here than in Horror of Frankenstein where he was supposed to be funny. Mike Raven stands around frowning and using Christopher Lee's eyes (in close-ups) and someone else's voice. That Strange love song is just rotten, I wasnt't going to write that because everyone knew that, but I just had to let it out.  The film does have some good sets, fine costumes and a few decent scenes. Hammer did some fine films in the early 70's like Twins of Evil and Hands of the ripper, but Lust shows the crack that was forming in the armor of British Horror.",986515200,6,1332,4.40650406504065

568084,3,6303112153,"Rightfully acknowledged as the weak link in Hammer's Karnstein Trilogy, I was surprised upon revisiting LUST FOR A VAMPIRE that it had more worthwhile moments than I remembered. Yutte Stensgaard as Mircalla is no Ingrid Pitt but she's not nearly as bad as some reveiwers and fans make her out to be. Mike Raven is made up to look just like Christopher Lee (they even sneak in a close-up of Lee's bloodshot eyes from another film) but he has a commanding presence and with Valentine Dyall's sonorous voice dubbed in, he more than fits the bill as Count Karnstein. Ralph Bates, who didn't like the script and only did it as a favor to substitute director Jimmy Sangster, is still memorable as an effete schoolmaster who knows Mircalla's secret.

I don't recall the film being as visually inventive as it was this go round. Mircalla's bloody resurrection, the freefall camerawork as bodies are dumped into a well, and Mircalla's outrageous demise are moments which engage you during the film and remain with you once the movie is over. Unfortunately nothing can be done to improve upon an uneven script, some dodgy editing, and the notorious insertion of a pop song STRANGE LOVE added by the producers into a lovemaking scene late in the film. Because of this director Jimmy Sangster and co-star Ralph Bates reportedly slid out of their seats at a preview screening and tried to leave the theater unnoticed. While LUST FOR A VAMPIRE is one of Hammer's missed opportunities it, like most of Hammer's early 1970s output, is still an entertaining way to kill 90 minutes especially if you're a fan of their movies.",1378598400,5,1607,4.8014440433212995

568086,4,6303112153,"""Lust for a Vampire"" (original title was: ""To Love a Vampire"") has to be Hammer's cheesiest vampire film, the second in their ""Karnstein Trilogy,"" ups the nudity (in an approved lesbian angle because it's viewed by the Count Karnstein character here played by hokey Mike Raven (with inserted eye close-up provided by Christopher Lee)).  This has the girls' finishing school where the ""Carmilla"" character (here played by the best looking Carmilla of the trilogy: Yutte Stensgaard) is enrolled by the Countess (and the Count as ""physician,"" always good for a death certificate certifying death by ""heart attack"") run by the most poor acting actresses and cast in a Hammer film, hard to believe it was directed by the great writer, Jimmy Sangster.  Even the somewhat accomplished actress Suzanna Leigh (who the year before was very good in Hammer's ""The Lost Continent"") here can not seem to give an unobviously more contrived performance.  Besides the ""light"" acting by newcomer Stensgaard, Michael Johnson gives the film's best performance.  Star Ralph Bates, replacing the mourning Peter Cushing, is not effective.  Sangster, although Bates was his only choice since Cushing dropped out after his accepting the directing helm, said the script, again by Tudor Gates, and the cast were already in place when he was hired.  The famed questionable auspiciously placed song, ""Strange Love"" (music composed by Harry Robinson with lyrics by Frank Godwin (and sung by someone called simply ""Tracy"") is actually an asset the famed dubious intentions of the producers Fine and Styles apparently got for nothing.  The movie would have been better titled as originally thought, but then the true intent of the newer producers at Hammer would may be disguised.

Some events are a little less than plausible, but overall it provides what I believe the then audience wanted - blood, babes and breasts!

568149,4,6303112153,"Beautiful Swedish actress Yutte Steinsgaard has reprised the role of the evil, bisexual vampire, Carmilla Karnstein in ""Lust for a Vampire.""  This is Hammer's sequel to ""The Vampire Lovers.""  Though not as violent and gory as the original, ""Lust for a Vampire"" is still a superb gothic chiller.

  Through the blood of a virgin, Carmilla Karnstein is resurrected with the young body of an eighteen year old; she is enrolled in the nearby finishing school for wealthy girls.  I suppose the producers felt that Ingrid Pitt who originally played Carmilla was too old to pass as a student.  This is a shame because Ingrid Pitt was more voluptuous and sensual.  She had quite a stage presence; she reminded me of a female version of Christopher Lee.  (And I loved her accent.)  Speaking of Lee, he should have been given the role of the vampire Count Karnstein.

  Unable to control her blood lust, Carmilla begins seducing and murdering villagers, classmates, and teachers.  Count and Countess Karnstein arrive at the school and do their best to cover up for her.  Naturally, more deaths ensue.

  Beautiful sets and costumes, eerie music, forbidden eroticism and gruesome murders make ""Lust for a Vampire"" a unique film from Hammer.  It is highly recommended for fans of Hammer, gothic horror, and vampire films.",1219276800,4,1309,4.976851851851852
568150,3,6303112153,"""Welcome to the finishing school where they really do finish you"" throatily growled the trailer to Lust For a Vampire, the troubled second film in Hammer's Karnstein trilogy, following on from The Vampire Lovers and preceding Twins of Evil. Peter Cushing dropped out when his wife fell ill while original director Terence Fisher broke his leg, resulting in Ralph Bates, channelling Dwight Frye, and Jimmy Sangster taking over.

It's the weakest of the three films, but it has a few things going for it, chief among them Yutte Stensgaard's bisexual vampire and Pippa Steel as one of her lesbian conquests/victims (the film could just as easily have been called Lesbian Vampire in a Girl's Dormitory and might have fared better at the box-office if it had). Michael Johnson, one of those identikit early 70s British actors you'd swear you've seen a dozen times before until you look at his filmography and realize you've never seen him in anything else, is the randy dandy author of lurid gothic tales who schemes his way into a English teaching job at a finishing school so he can have his wicked way with one of the students, Yutte Stensgaard's Mircalla, not realizing that she's an even more accomplished predator who's working her way through the schoolgirls there herself. Not that he's overly concerned when he finds out, but that's no surprise considering Yutte's main competition is Suzanna Leigh, who looks about as much fun as mucking out a stable on a hot day and spends most of the film with a scornful disappointed scowl on her face that combines with unflattering photography to make her appear much like you'd imagine Joanna Lumley's brother might after a night on the tiles.

The story isn't particularly compelling and the screenplay isn't one of Hammer's best: it's the kind of film where a line of dialogue like ""What you need is a -"" is immediately accompanied by the fortuitous arrival of a Bishop with a line in killing the undead before the line can be finished. But it does feature much 70s nudity and even an oral sex scene to the accompaniment of perhaps the most memorable song in Hammer's oeuvre, the aptly-named Strange Love, while disc jockey Mike Raven is quite hilariously dubbed by Valentine Dyall - his delivery of the line ""Heart attack!"" is guaranteed to bring the house down.

Anchor Bay's Region 1 DVD has a good selection of extras and a fine widescreen transfer.",1204675200,3,2400,4.8345498783454985
568151,2,6303112153,"Made in 1970 by Hammer, and the second of the Karnstein films, this is just about watchable hokum but no more than that. As previous reviewers have noted in many ways this is nearer to being an exploitation movie than a horror film. However remember this was made in 1970 so showing a lot of women topless was still a relatively daring thing to do, and the film still rates as an 18 on the DVD I have.

So aside from the entertainment for men, what else has it got going for it? Well in all honesty not a huge amount. It is quite well photographed, but the script and some of the acting left a fair bit to be desired. Having said that I don't remember Count Karstein (Mike Raven) actually saying anything throughout the film so you can't complain about the script in that respect. Probably its main fault is the lack of a quality leading actor. Theres no Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing or Andrew Keir for that matter. However it is only just over 90 minutes long so its all over reasonably quickly.

This really is one for Hammer completists, and certainly is not in the same class Hammers best films ('Horror of Dracula' or 'The Devil Rides Out').",1195171200,,1148,4.410377358490566

568153,4,6303112153,"LUST FOR A VAMPIRE is the second (and almost universally considered the weakest) of Hammer's ""Carmilla Trilogy"" based on J. Sheridan LeFanu's famed short story.

A bit loopy and campy, this film is nowhere as bad as its detractors want it to be, though DRACULA it isn't and can never be.

In LUST FOR A VAMPIRE, the lesbian vampire Carmilla Karnstein (played here by Danish actress/model Yutte Stensgaard, who is one of the blondest, most sensuous, and ethereal women to ever grace a movie screen) decides to make an 1830s  girls' finishing school her favorite haunt. She spends a great deal of time finishing the girls, quite enjoyably. The women are all universally voluptuous and beautiful, and bare breasts and bodies are well in evidence.

As with all Hammer films, LUST FOR A VAMPIRE is stylish and visually attractive, though the script here is weak and a bit chaotic, leaving way too many loose ends, even for a Hammer production. But if you're watching LUST FOR A VAMPIRE for its storyline you're confusing it with some other movie. So sit back, and take in the unforgettably erotic spectacle of a chocolate-syrup blood smeared Yutte Stensgaard snacking on some of the sweetest eye candy in all filmdom.",1152662400,21,1212,4.868932038834951
568154,4,6303112153,"What's that me hounds of classic Hammer horror films?  You say you want more of the titillating, fantabuloso, bloodsucking, Sapphic action you enjoyed so much in the popular film The Vampire Lovers (1970)?  Well, fret not, as Hammer Studios heard your grubby pleas and punched out this sequel, titled Lust for a Vampire (1971).  Directed Jimmy Sangster, known for his excellent writing work on such films like X the Unknown (1956), The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), and Dracula (1958), the film stars Ralph Bates (Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde), Michael Johnson (Anne of the Thousand Days), and Yutte Stensgaard (Scream and Scream Again), in her last silver screen appearance.  Also appearing is Barbara Jefford (The Ninth Gate), Suzanna Leigh (The Lost Continent), Helen Christie (Rasputin: The Mad Monk), and former pirate radio station disc jockey Mike Raven, whom I last saw in the fairly rotten film Crucible of Terror (1971).

The film, set in the year 1830, begins with the abduction of a peasant girl, whose yams are literally bursting forth from her cleavage, begging for a squeeze.  The girl ends up being used in some black magic ritual (what a waste), one that reincarnates what I guess to be a vampire, and a sexy one at that...we then switch to a nearby town where we meet noted author Richard Lestrange (Johnson), who's visiting the area interested in researching material for a new book.  Seems the town has had some bad luck over the years, specifically with a family by the name of Karnstein, and their now dilapidated castle that is no longer occupied...or is it?  Anyway, turns out the vampiric activity follows a 40-year cyclical timetable, and the anniversary is here...sure enough, young, boobalicious girlies begin to go missing.  Richard thinks the idea of vampires is a lot of hooey, decides to visit the castle, where he meets the nerdy and bespeckled teacher Giles Barton (Bates), co-founder of a newly opened school for buxom bouncing beauties who enjoy giving themselves massages (oops, that girl's shirt fell off) and nekkid nighttime swims (yowsa).  Richard becomes infatuated with a teacher named Janet Playfair (Leigh), and subsequently weasels his way into a teaching position, but then later falls under the thrall Mircalla (Stensgaard), who is actually Carmilla Karnstein, the same girl we saw brought back from the dead (or undead) at the beginning of the film!  Soon a sinister cloud of evil falls over the school, as the blood drained bodies begin to pile up...it's a veritable vampires virginal smorgasbord, and no one is safe...

All right, I tend to agree with some of the others in that this film may not be as bad as many claim it is, but in terms of a Hammer Production, it is pretty stinky...Sangster himself was embarrassed by the results (particularly the inclusion of the song `Strange Love', to which I'd agree with him), and claimed he was basically along for the ride, taking the helm just prior to shooting after the original director, Terrence Fisher, was unable to proceed after breaking his leg.  Apparently Peter Cushing was meant to appear, but due to his wife's illness at the time, opted out, to which Ralph Bates was brought in...and then there's Ingrid Pitt, who played the role of Mircalla/Carmilla Karnstein in The Vampire Lovers...she declined to appear in this follow up because she thought the script awful.  Seems this film had a lot going against it from the get go, but I'll tell you what, there is some fun to be had, if you don't expect too much.  If you look at Sangster's credits, you'll notice his specialty seemed more in crafting tales, rather than directing, but he did do a decent job here, even if his heart wasn't in it.  I thought most of the actors did reasonably well, but the main problem to me was a lack of focus.  There were a great number of characters running around, more than necessary, and some of them ended up getting the short end of the stick.  I though Raven played an interesting character, and assumed he'd have more screen time based on his pronounced present of the DVD case artwork, but that wasn't the case.  Most of the time he slinked around on the peripheral, throwing sinister glares about.  He should have been utilized more, especially given his commanding presence and booming, baritone voice.  Also, I thought more could have been done with Barbara Jefford's character of Countess Herritzen...she seemed a rich (and sexy), untapped vein of juiciness waiting to be mined.  And then there was the police inspector, played by Harvey Hall (The Vampire Lovers).  I thought his character surprisingly strong, but ultimately wasted.  What was up with Ralph Bates character?  He prominent in the story initially, but then poof!  He's gone...sort of pointless, if you ask me.  Like I said, too many characters floating around resulting in uneven focus overall.  Yutte Stensgaard did well, but let's face it, she's no Ingrid Pitt, and as many a Hammer fan knows, that's one corset that's especially hard to fill...the general atmosphere of the film worked alright (there are some really beautiful settings), but it felt lacking in the signature darker, more gothic tones normally associated with previous Hammer horror works, but then again, the studio was in a period of decline, one which it sadly wouldn't survive.  There were a few good films that came out in this later period, Twins of Evil (1971) for example, but it wasn't like it was in the old days.  Some of my favorite parts of the film (beside the copious boobage) included the scenes where the weak willed head mistress Miss Simpson gets chastised by not only the police inspector, but later by a father of one of the dead girls, presenting the best `deer caught in the headlights' expression I've ever seen...you see, Miss Simpson neglected to report the various incidents in a timely manner as she was so worried about a scandal, as she had all her money tied up in the school.  Also, be sure to catch the exchange between the characters of Richard Lestrange and the uber effeminate Professor Herz, played by Erik Chitty (The Vault of Horror), as Richard fools the man into leaving prior to his arriving at the school so that Richard may take his place.  The ending provides quite the entertaining (if not clich) spectacle, in that of the old `angry townspeople with torches' routine...I never get tired of that...

Anchor Bay Entertainment provides an excellent uncut, uncensored widescreen (1.77:1) picture on this DVD, enhanced for 16X9 televisions.  The picture quality is clear, vibrant, and generally beautiful.  Also, the Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio is crisp and comes through very well.  There are some excellent features, including an audio commentary track with director Jimmy Sangster and actress Suzanna Leigh (she never popped her top in the film), moderated by Hammer film historian Marcus Hearn, along with a theatrical trailer, radio spots, a poster and still gallery, talent bios, and a 5X7 insert reproduction of original poster artwork for the film, the flipside listing the chapter stops.  All in all a five star release of a three star film, hence the four star rating.

Le Fanu's original works were known for their atmosphere; unfortunately, the atmosphere in this film is reliant almost solely on Harry Robinson's typically lush and impressive score. Certainly Sangster's direction is leaden and the cast are markedly lacklustre, with Mike Raven awkwardly moulded to the look and persona of Christopher Lee -- indeed, there are even one or two lazy stock-shots from Lee's earlier Dracula appearances -- but he is utterly lacking in Lee's magnetism and acting ability. In the absence of a convincing villain, the absence of a strong hero is even more conspicuous, with the vampire hunter turning up too late in the game in the form of an elderly bishop managing only to utter a few cliches about fighting the devil. What Hammer's earlier vampire films had was two weighty antagonists, well-sketched and providing conflict to fuel the drama on a cosmic scale. What Lust for a Vampire has is lots of bare breasts and very little narrative drive.",1121990400,4,1528,4.96484375
568197,4,6303112153,"'Lust for a Vampire', I feel, is unfairly treated. It may not be the best Hammer film ever but it is not the worst.

Yutte Stensgaard plays Mircalla (Or would you prefer Carmilla?), she is quite stunning and while she is not as good as Ingrid Pitt in the role, she fairs quite well despite being dubbed.

The other cast members include the very underrated Ralph Bates, who plays Giles Barton, Suzanna Leigh as Miss Playfair, Barbara Jefford as Countess Heritzen and the famous DJ Mike Raven as Count Karnstein (he is dubbed also).

Kirsten lindolm (Betts), who played the first Vampire in 'The Vampire Lovers' also makes a return as a peasant girl.

I am going to us bullet points for this film.

The Good
*The Performances are reasonably good, despite what people say.
*Yutte Stensgaard plays one of the most beautiful vampires in film
*The death of Giles is very effective.
*The musical score is brilliant.
*The production values are excellent.

The Bad
*The Greco-Roman dance is very embarrassing and obviously for titillation.
*The continuity is not the best, and a lot of things are not fully explained.

I could say more things to put in both categories but it would take to long. The plot is still quite good and the infamous song Strange Love is not that bad really and can be quite catchy.

I suggest you buy this if you liked 'The Vampire Lovers' or if you like Hammer and Horror.

Thanks for reading my review.",1116547200,4,1421,4.629482071713148
568198,4,6303112153,"While not my fave Hammer vampire flick, ""Lust"" is in the top 5. This DVD transfer by Anchor Bay should be held up as an example of superior craftsmanship. The color and detail are just beautiful, and I'm not even watching it in Progressive scan.

The plot is very loosely based on an actual 19th century horror classic ""Carmilla"" by  french author Le Fanu. In fact it pre-dates ""Dracula"" by several years and probably inspired Stoker's work.

But this movie is way more fun than that. Hammer director Jimmy Sangster often comes up short when compared to Terence Fisher, however Sangster is just as capable, and he has great fun at the beginning of this film teasing the audience's expectations of the vampire movie genre. Check out the scene when the hero thinks he is surrounded by hungry vampire brides....

Yes, there are lots of gratuitous breast shots. This seems almost innocent compared to what you can see on late night cable these days....

Sangster uses some amazing deep focus camera shots. The main actors are surprsingly effective and believeable. In fact it occured to me that this 70's ""B"" movie looks like shakespeare compared to the awful teen slasher and zombie flicks Hollywood has spat out in recent years. But it's a fun movie with lots of blood and attractive, nubile girls parading about the beautifully photographed Gothic/Romantic English landscape.

If you're a fan of classic or cult vampire movies this won't disappoint you. And of course, you'll never forget the music video of ""strange love""! This is not as good as the early  Lee/Cushing flicks, but is much better than most of Hammer's later films. It's an absolute guilty pleasure...in fact a ""StraaaAAAAnge LOOoove....""",1111449600,4,1703,4.933566433566433
568199,3,6303112153,"Set in the 1830s in some fictitious east European country, it begins with the evil Count and Countess Karnstein catching themselves a young virgin from  the village whom they sacrifice to the Devil in order to resurrect the beautiful Countess Carmilla (Yutte Stensgaard). We then switch scene to young writer of horror stories, Richard LeStrange (Michael Johnson) arriving in the local village to hear the usual stories about how the castle on the hill is a Place of Evil blah blah blah. So off he goes to investigate only to discover that, place of evil or not, it is now adjacent to a posh girl's finishing school brimful of stunning young women including a certain Mircalla who he is instantly smitten by, rather unhappily as her name being an anagram for `Carmilla' is no accident. Smitten as he is he quickly contrives to get taken on as an English teacher and is given lodgings to share with the decidedly strange history teacher Giles Barton played by Ralph Bates. Obviously it isn't long before nubile young ladies start cropping up dead with strange marks on their necks.
A fair amount of confusion seems to have reigned over the making of this. It's a sequel to the earlier 'Vampire Lovers' where Ingrid Pitt played the role of Carmilla. Here they couldn't get her so they used the relatively unkown Stensgaard. Terence Fisher was originally pencilled in to direct but Sangster had to take over when that fell through. And Peter Cushing was originally to have been cast as Barton but was replaced by Bates when that didn't work out either. Not that any of these replacements prove so very disastrous. Sangster does a decent enough job. Stensgaard is pretty good in the lead: it was probably the high point of her short career before she quit to work for a Christian radio station in the USA. And Bates isn't Cushing but is still serviceably creepy. The weak point of the film and the main reason this is one of Hammer's less successful vampire movies is Johnson as LeStrange who should be the dramatic and emotional centre of the movie but who fails to breath life into a serious disappointingly feeble and uninteresting character. Suzanna Leigh is equally lacklustre as Janet Playfair, the main goodie female character, the virtuous young teacher who takes a fancy to LeStrange (who is surely just not interesting enough to be very credibly such a big hit with the ladies, both dead and undead, as he is here). So by no means the greatest of the Hammer vampires but great fun nonetheless. If you like this sort of thing (and I have to say love it) all the ingredients are there: blood, sex, evil old counts with V-shaped haircuts, muttering villagers, peasant girls with heaving bosoms, black carriages with big black horses, noctural assignations, vampires turning to skeletons after getting `staked', bodies down wells, stalwart local policemen who don't really know what they're up against, creepy graveyards... Oh go on. You know you really want to.",1080691200,9,2964,4.834645669291339
568200,1,6303112153,"A poor follow-up to ""The Vampire Lovers,"" no classic itself,  ""Lust for a Vampire"" continues Hammer Sutidos' efforts to resurrect their vampire franchise with hopped up levels of sex and blood. Though based on J. Sheridan LeFanu's immortal novella ""Carmilla,"" there's nothing literary about LFAV's script,which essentially meanders aimlessly from one lesbian vampire shot to the next until everything mercifully burns up at the end.  Interminably paced, amateurishly written, and largely nonsensical as anything other than softcore cheesecake with a strong dash of blood, LFAV lacks even ""The Vampire Lovers"" strong cast to give it some buoyancy.  Michael Johnson's writer/teacher is a pain, Yutte Stensgaard is more than attractive but totally unconvincing as a vampire, Mike Raven does a good Christopher Lee imitation but then disappears, and Ralph Bates, whose performance is certainly the best of the whole cast, doesn't have enough to do and vanishes too quickly.
It's a pity, because this could have been a good movie if it had only been taken in a different direction.  The plot, background, and vampire movie experience are all there--Hammer just doesn't do anything with them.
""Lust For a Vampire"" has more than its fair share of fans and I used to be one of them.  Today it continues to appeal to red-blooded teen males of all ages despite its numerous shortcomings, largely because of its blood, nudity, and lesbian undertones.  LFAV is surely light fare compared to many modern horror efforts, and looks like a model of restrained etiquette compared to some contemporary vampire films. But there are many better vampire films out there, such as the original ""Nosferatu"" or Bela Lugosi's ""Dracula,"" not to mention Hammer's own ""Horror of Dracula"" or ""Brides of Dracula.""  These are movies of class, distinction, imagination and mystery. Give one of those a try and I think you'll agree there's no comparison.",1075766400,9,1920,5.214285714285714
568201,3,6303112153,"Lust For a Vampire is the second part of the Karnstein trilogy, that began with Vampire Lovers and which was to conclude with Twins of Evil.  Of the three movies, this one is definitely the weak link in the three, but still has some merits.  Originally, Peter Cushing and Ingrid Pitt had been tapped to star in this film, but due to family illness, Cushing opted out, and Pitt's prior committment to another project at the time made her unavailable.  One can only wonder how the film would have benefited with Cushing's cultured experience and Pitt's stony, seductive approach.  As it stood, we had to content ourselves with Ralph Bates and Jutte Stensgard, a Danish bombshell with no acting talent whatsoever.  Bates wasn't so bad as the schoolmaster, he brought a sleaziness that improved the character.  But Jutte Stensgard, however, just doesn't stack up to the role of Micarlla-although she is undeniably some very fine eye candy, she is neither menacing nor believable as a vampire.  Also, another blow to the production was Terence Fisher's exit from the project and Jimmy Sangster taking up the directorial helm at the last minute.  Did Sangster contribute more of an erotic element to this picture-watch the first 30 minutes of relentless toplessness and near nudity and judge for yourself.  Where the film gets interesting is when the body count starts to grow, and when Bate's schoolmaster Giles character comes more into prominence.  Chief strengths of the film are the night scenes, and the rustic location as a whole.  I've always believed that the best vampire stories are set in small villages as opposed to cities.  As a whole, the film suffers from weak characters (""I love you""s come at the weirdest, most implausible moments), a very thin plot that seems as if it has been padded by lots of gratuitous nudity, and a very bizarre decision on someone's part to place a pop song in the middle of a seduction scene!  Also, you will need to suspend your knowledge of vampire lore, because these vampires walk and play in the daytime.  The violence is almost non-existent.  There is a sacrificial scene at the very beginning of the film, and a couple of graphic stakings later on, but that's about it.  The DVD features are commendable.  There are some nice poster galleries and a clear commentary track.  There is a hidden treat for Stensgard fans (go to features and then hit right arrow to light up the cross on the dagger, and then hit enter).  If you choose to bypass this film for something else, you will be none the worse for missing it.",1055548800,,2559,4.775
568202,3,6303112153,"The middle chapter of Hammer's Karnstein trilogy (between The Vampire Lovers and Twins of Evil), LUST FOR A VAMPIRE is a  textbook example of the studio's penchant for excess in the early '70s.  Fans of classic Hammer fare like Horror of Dracula and Curse of Frankenstein will be disappointed with the weak script and atrocious acting.  But if the lesbian vampire sub-genre is your thing, you'll, uh, get off on this film.
Treasure or trash, LUST FOR A VAMPIRE looks fantastic thanks to the wonderful folks at Anchor Bay.  There's a commentary track that is fairly pedestrian, and the goofy theatrical trailer.

This is much better than Twins of Evil, & more explicit in its nudity & vampirism than the Vampire Lovers.
I remember seeing this on video in the early 1980s when my hormones were a popping - and thus it's always held a special place in my staked heart.
The major inconsistency with the plot is that at the vampire's vicitms scream when they are attacked at the beginning of the film, but by the end of the film the last victim's almost in orgasm as she's being attacked - did the vampire just get better at biting?",1029024000,8,662,4.346774193548387

The first couple of vampire attacks are on cute girls - a buxom barmaid and a cute schoolgirl both in lovely low-cut period dresses. You also get the gorgeous Yutte Stensgard naked, and extended encounters between the vampiress and both male and female schoolteachers. For me, the high point is when the vampiress Mircalla hypnotises one of her victims and the camera shows the scene from the victim's viewpoint - if you're at all into erotic hypnosis I defy you to keep your hands away from your groin during this bit - you'll feel like she's enslaving you with her gaze.
