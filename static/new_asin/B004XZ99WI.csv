8447644,1,B004XZ99WI,I bought this used for $3.  After 30 minutes I threw it away.  This a terrible movie...no social redeeming value whatsoever and definitely not a classic.  Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!  They claim this is a Cheezy Classic.  It is...a ROTTEN CHEEZY BOMB!,1392940800,,244,4.853658536585366
8447645,5,B004XZ99WI,"After a man drops dead in a bloody heap, his blood is analyzed by scientists who discover that it's reproducing itself at an incredible rate! Meanwhile, mysterious farmers have come to town, and the horror only gets worse! A dog is flogged to death, and a newlywed couple is abducted by the fiendish farmers, on their wedding night! Soon, the blood sample at the lab is overflowing its beaker! INVASION OF THE BLOOD FARMERS is a semi-creepy, totally imbecilic masterwork of extraterrestrial exsanguination! I will never get the glub-glub sound of their bloodsucking machines out of my head! Nothing can possibly erase the image of the black-hooded farmer battling the shirtless hillbilly! The tie-in w/ the druids is beyond brilliant! If Hershel Gordon Lewis ever made an alien farmer movie, it would be just like this! Nothing can prepare you for the nonsensical finale! The CHEEZY FLICKS presentation is fine, although it was a bit blurry during the opening credits...",1369008000,,970,5.06875
8447646,1,B004XZ99WI,"I saw the movie in Austin TX,enjoyed it for its throwed off weird and crazy flavor. I wanted a personal copy but the one I recieved was so technically screwed up,where to begin. Dialogue was fading in and out,timing was off..it was unbearable. Total crap production from the manufacturer. Do Not Buy!",1363996800,5,300,4.788461538461538
