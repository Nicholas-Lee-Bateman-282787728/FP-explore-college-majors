2459304,1,B000CDSS0Y,"As a fan of the original Prince & Me this sequel has to be one of the worst ever made. Aside from the talented Luke Mably (who clearly looks uncomfortable in his reprised role as Prince Edvard of Denmark) the rest of the cast and the whole plot of the film is hideous. The actress portraying Paige (Kam Hesketh)lacks any depth and refinement that Julia Stiles brought to the role in the first film. In this sequel some ancient law prohibits Edvard from marrying Paige. Enter some poor Norwegian royal and his ditzy daughter Princess Kirsten who wants to marry Edvard and become Queen of Denmark. In the role of Zoren (The Prince's assistant) Jonathan Firth manages to retain some of the dignity that Ben Miller created, but Maryam D'Abo's  Queen Rosalind looks more like a well worn socialite from the Cape and the King has suddenly transformed into a bald and bearded old man. There is no Arabella (Edvard's sister)and Paige's parents are totally miscast. I cannot understand why this follow-up was ever made since Luke Mably is the only returning cast member. This film went straight to DVD so the studio will never recoupe their losses for this turkey.",1140480000,180,1155,4.746268656716418

2459306,1,B000CDSS0Y,"This movie is awful!! The lead actress acts inept and ditsy. Nothing like Julia Stile's character in first movie. Also the actress was way to old to be playing a new college graduate. I have tried to watch this movie every couple years just because I loved the first one so much, but can never make it more than half way before turning it off.",1493424000,2,343,4.292307692307692

2459316,5,B000CDSS0Y,"I watched all 4 movies, thought they all were very family friendly and enjoyable. Only wished they could have continued the story beyond The Prince and Me 4, it would be interesting to see how the King and Queen are doing later in life.

2459323,1,B000CDSS0Y,ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE DIFFERENT. It's pretty tough to follow because you're trying to figure out who everyone is....and I'm sorry Julia Stiles was a much better Paige Morgan,1481673600,,174,5.0344827586206895

2459333,4,B000CDSS0Y,"We enjoyed it. It was a bit of a shock to have a different bride but she did very well. We are old and finding it hard to take advantage of free prime so that's disappointing. We tried to watch the Prince and Me and the Royal Honeymoon, but, we failed.",1474502400,,252,3.9607843137254903
2459334,1,B000CDSS0Y,"I recently introduced my 10-year old daughter to the Prince & Me with Luke Mably and Julia Stiles (the first one), which I have really enjoyed and she liked very much.  So we decided to watch this one (I had never seen). The entire cast is different except for Luke Malby.  As with many sequels it just wasn't there.  While it was watching it do-able it wasn't something I would ever watch again and glad I didn't pay a lot to see it.  It was really poorly written and the chemistry between the two of these actors just wasn't there like in the original.  It really reminded me of Princess Diaries 2, almost identical story line except Princes Diaries had a better cast.",1473206400,5,670,4.414634146341464

2459351,2,B000CDSS0Y,"My least favorite of the group of the prince and me movies. The plot was ridiculous and the ending was bizarre. I really liked the young lady who played the princess today, but the young man just seem to be going through the steps. The villain with so obvious it was an insult to the characters that it took so long for them to catch on.",1445817600,,337,4.121212121212121
2459352,3,B000CDSS0Y,"I have to agree with the other reviews.  Luke Mably had a hard time, but he persevered throughout.  NO passion like with Julia Stiles. I agree Soren tried and did a pretty decent presentation.  Again, what happened to Arabella?  If nothing else she could have had a couple of ""cameo""  entrances and exits, being she would be a teenager and probably off to boarding school.  I also agree, the King in the first movie was ill.  Probably could have had a great recovery, but he was made to look like he wasn't going to live.  I think most of the problem was a casting one. It was obvious that Kam Heskin did not want any kissing and showed hardly ANY emotion.  The way she kissed was like she was kissing an uncle she didn't like.  The biggest ""fairy tale"" was when Paige's parents arrived for the wedding on time, and lived 15 hours away, even with the fastest plane available.  I agree the parents were a disappointment. The parents in the first movie were very good role models for prosperous farmers. Goes back again to casting.",1445644800,5,1029,4.478494623655914

2459368,3,B000CDSS0Y,For my personal opinion the movie is a good movie. But it would have been better with the original cast . its was a good thing they kept Luke Mably after all he did play the prince.and he played his part very well.,1431388800,2,214,4.0

2459370,4,B000CDSS0Y,"Luke Mably is definitely better at the Prince role than the actor who comes after him.  In this one, the royalness of his character is really on display--he's quite the rick prick.  You wonder why Paige Morgan, played by Kam Hesking, even sticks with him.  But the story is pretty entertaining and true love wins out so all is well.",1430956800,,332,4.5

I think this, more than anything else, plays a large part in the movie not being judged unbiasly.

I start watching this and see that they have changed her character into a young woman that looks like she spends hours at the salon, getting botex injected into her lips and having her hair highlighted and styled. She's so covered in make-up that I honestly thought she was just a fan chasing the prince. This is supposed to be Paige?!?! They've taken a character that young girls could look up to and turned her into another barbie doll with no depth. Completely insulting to women everywhere. Do your self a favor and skip this one.

I enjoyed the first movie and would likely re-watch that before attempting to watch this again.

2459701,5,B000CDSS0Y,"Finally, I get to see the sequel to The Prince and Me. If you haven't seen either movie yet, do see the first movie first, then the second movie second.

In the first movie, our commoner college student meets up with her prince at a small college in the United States, not knowing that he is truly a prince.

In this movie, she is finishing up her studies to become a doctor in her new adopted country, and finishing up her studies about how to be a Queen, which will happen when she marries the Prince, future King.

Of course, there is jealousy from a nefarious cousin who can gain the throne for himself if he can force the Prince to abdicate his future throne, so everyone must do what they can to help the people's choice for Queen.

While it is predictable in spots, it was a wonderful surprise when I saw things happen that I never expected in a movie like this.

I saw the first movie six months ago, and saw this movie just yesterday, so next month, I plan to watch both of them in one evening.

I do enjoy movies that focus on the Prince and the Pauper, even if the Pauper is a student, not poor, and a romantic interest already known to the Prince.

2459825,3,B000CDSS0Y,I love silly romances and I enjoyed the first movie in this series with Julia Stiles.  This sequel just doesn't have the same feel as the first movie.  The only character played by the same person is the prince.  This had silly scenes that were a bit too much for me.,1379548800,,267,4.196078431372549

The acting was stilted, had CGI butterflies that drove me crazy. The acting seemed forced and not playful like it was with the original movie.

However, everything in the production was changed and none of it for the better.  The princess was no longer attractive in anyway, the parents were completely different and the plot became a farce using an old worn out plot.  After about 1/2 hour my partner and I looked at each other, turned it off and tried another movie.

In this one I was actually rooting for her to end up with her college friend because for some reason the prince's (although he is enjoyable to watch) role was dumbed down and Paige was a completely different character.

2459852,2,B000CDSS0Y,"I realize that this franchise isn't Casablanca, but this sequel to the first Prince & Me is just a little too low budget. The lead female (who replaces Julia Stiles in this sequel) should be paying us to watch her as she is clearly still learning the subtle art of acting for the camera. Though she is a really pretty girl, her stylists do everything they can to make her look odd and caricaturish. Seriously, her stylists should never put this show on their resume because their work was so poor.

The storytelling was dull and lifeless, relying on every stock character and stereotype possible. I'll try not to commit any spoilers but by the end of the movie, these writers have done nothing more than do their best to turn that handsome and charming young monarch of Denmark into anything but a prince.",1374105600,,805,4.590277777777778

It was definitely sappy, but humorous at times.",1373414400,,340,4.2
2459855,3,B000CDSS0Y,"The magic of the first movie where Julia Stiles was the female lead is missing in this sequel.  It was an okay preteen movie for a slumber party with a predictable happy ending. The interloping female who tried to steal the prince was a very cardboard cutout as was her father.  If you really loved the original, skip this one and hold onto the good memories of a better story.

2459856,3,B000CDSS0Y,"I think we can all agree that after the first movie...it was all downhill.
Its one of those film series that had the possibility of being an epic romantic comedy but they were stupid with the casting and plotlines and kabluee. Mistake #1 was replacing Julia Stiles with this blonde unknown actress. Mistake #2 was replacing Luke Mably.
The first film is loveable and worth owning for any chickflick lover. The plot is deep,the acting...very good.
On to movie #2. Cutesy...bearable at best. One that maybe you get a strange urge to watch once in a while but that happens very rarely.
Typical predictable plot: Happy engagement. Wham!!! loophole. Enter spoiled bratt former best friend of new king.
Must marry...blah blah blah.
Kirsten-Kristen...whatever her name is pretends to be Paige's friend..sabotage..blah blah blah.
Still bugs me...Paige is NOT BLONDE!!!!!
Paige seeks comfort from a male friend...tabloids get involved. Huge fight. Though this was started by Edward refusing to give up the throne for the woman he loves. Made even worse by his dancing around the question and not giving a straight answer.
Paige breaks up with Edward and Leaves. the exact line is ""I suddenly feel very stupid. I was actually starting to believe in the fairytale.""
Paige now thinks Kirsten is very right about the two of them. Paige leaves and guess who ends up being the proverbial crying shoulder. Yep,Kirsten.
Must stop Edward from marrying Kirsten. Must find a loophole to ye old ancient danish loyal pertaining to royalty marriages.
Loophole found. Happily ever after.
Sadly, this is not the worst it gets.
3 & 4 are basically EXTREMELY lame,highly embarrassing save the planet types.

2459861,5,B000CDSS0Y,I found this movie to be quaint.  There are still obstacles that Paige must overcome to become Queen of Denmark.  I think Kam Heskin does a very good job in the role of Paige.  There is one other character who does reprise his role and that is Soren.  He was in the first movie and he continues through the next two movies.  I enjoyed this movie immensely.  It is the way she gets over these obstacles that is so entertaining.  I for one will continue to enjoy this movie.,1370908800,2,472,4.235955056179775

The new Page is very lacking the actress isn't able to make you believe she is someone that once changed a prince and make him inspire to be great. Very hard to watch and not wince the whole way through. Only reason I finished the movie in the first place is I had kept hoping it would turn around and when I realized it wasn't going to then I had put too much time into the movie to not see the ending.

This movie has a different director and a low budget feel about it. Luke Mably was the only good thing about this. And because of his contract, he was forced to make this sequel. Trust me, you can tell that he's none to happy to be in this. Kam Heskin who now plays Paige Morgan, can't hold a candle to Julia Stiles, honestly Kam isn't very good.

I was disappointed because the original Paige, was determine and strong willed who believed in her following her dreams.

Deep down we all want to have a relationship where we admire and support one another. . . to be cherished and encouraged.  It's just a happy movie in the midst of real life.  A get away and relax.  Laugh and cry.  I think they did a tremendous job.  Wish there were more like this.  I think Kam brings an elegance to the character that Julia didn't have as a ""queen-to-be"".

He proposes, his family objects to commoners, she is reluctant to cast aside her work toward healing the sick. They bid each other goodbye and go their separate ways.

I didn't care for the change of actors.  I also can't imagine a girl who would go through all that and still hang around a while after he would not answer that he would not give her up for the throne and immediately make plans to marry someone else.  Get real!  She found the loop hole after all that!  It wasn't until the last minute that he decided he loved her more than the throne but she had been working all that time to find the loophole.  Instead of just having someone tell the ""wicked"" girl that they weren't getting married, they tried to make something comical by locking her in a room and having her ride a horse, fall in the mud and run in the church.  I'm sure that was supposed to be funny but it was just stupid.  The change in actors, the bad acting and the attempts at humor in this movie actually made it just sad.

Part of the charm of the first version was the interaction of Eddie with Paige's family.  There was much to explore in the sequel for Paige to do the same with Eddie's parents.

2459907,1,B000CDSS0Y,"I loved the first The Prince and Me and was excited that a sequel was being made. Unfortunately, the sequel falls far, far short of the the first movie.

The first problem I noticed was that the entire film is just slightly out of focus. I didn't see a single crystal clear shot in the whole film. In addition the lighting was such that it seems as if no one gave lighting any consideration. All in all, very sub-par photography.

The next problem was the script. The actors lines seemed very stilted almost as if the script writer was a beginner. It was almost as if the shooting script was first draft. There were a number of places in the movie where the writer could have inserted really good lines for the actors ... but didn't ... for whatever reason.

There was also a problem with continuity; things would change from shot to shot and it seemed as if no one was paying any attention to detail. A lot of things changed from the first movie; Paige is now blonde, Edvard's father is healthy again, no mention is made of his sister Arabella, Paiges parents look as if someone grabbed them right off the street. The list goes on and on.

The climax of the movie, the wedding scene, was truly disappointing. This was a ""royal"" wedding? Mt brothers wedding was better than this and it certainly wasn't royal!

The DVD itself is also disappointing. Amazon lists the DVD as wide screen. The printed DVD front and back also indicate that it is wide screen. They are both mistaken. What the movie actually is is a wide screen movie letter boxed into full screen. It WILL NOT play in wide screen.

In summation, this movie fits right in along with Plan 9 From Outer Space and The Robot Monster.

The film has a silly but entertaining enough plotline lifted straight from The Princess Diaries 2, as laws of succession suddenly interfere with the royal marriage plans.  Unlike the original TP&M, which was a romantic drama focused on character development sprinkled with a few comedic moments, this film is a slapstick romantic comedy featuring physical comedy and minimal character development.  Luke Mably, who was terrific in his performance as the prince in the original, adeptly transitioning from reckless playboy to clueless college student to regal ruler, is given little to do other than to look pretty, furrowing his brow whenever problems arise in his relationship with Paige.  Paige as portrayed by Heskin is a likable enough heroine, if a bit of a lightweight compared to her devious rival, the Princess Kirsten of Norway played by Clemency Burton-Hill, who is trying to steal Edvard (and the title of Queen of Denmark) away.  Mably and Heskin don't generate the heat that he and Stiles shared in the original, but you still root for Paige to hold on to her man as she struggles to fit into to royal society while surrounded by sharks.  Kirsten's battles with Paige and her ultimate comeuppance at the hands of Edvard's trusted manservant Soren (played with great humor by Jonathan Firth) are probably the highlights of the film.",1214006400,,1560,5.0271317829457365

One of the problems is that is really destroys the character of ""Paige Morgan"" - one of the main roles. The character was a lot more classy in the first movie, and this just rips it away.

When you compare the first and the second though, of course, the first one is going to be better. The cast in the first one is more ably than the second.

In the first movie, you have Julia Stiles and Miranda Richardson. They alone ably moved the movie right along. In the second one, you have a completely new cast, and every actor has a certain way in which they see their character; so, you mustn't be too harsh when you've seen the differentiation.

What I consider to be the downfall of the movie is the presentation of the characters and even the actors they chose, because it is the actors that brings a certain something to a film.

Paige's look in this movie is prissy. I thought the actress, Kam Heskin, is better fitted in a movie such as Mean Girls or something of the like. She also doesn't hold onto the portrayal very well. She seems to lose grasp on the concept of Paige's character every now and then (And she pouts too much).

Luke Mably seems lost and uncomfortable in the film. During the first movie, his performance isn't bad. It is actually quite good. I think he gets a bit lost in this movie because he doesn't have a compatible actor to work against as in the first one with Julia Stiles.

What is also disappointing is the lack of depth in the plot. The plot seems almost silly and childish. There's a lacking of character development in the script (which may have also caused the actors to fail a bit in this department).

The Prince & me 2 isn't a five star production BUT if you watch the sequel for what it is you will find that it is a nice clean romantic comedy. Give this movie a go!!",1159401600,3,465,3.905263157894737
2459932,3,B000CDSS0Y,"I loved the first ""Prince and Me"" and was sad to see that Julia Stiles did not return for the sequel. I didn't expect much from the movie after having read some of the reviews but ""Prince and Me 2"" really isn't as bad as it is made out to be.  You cannot compare it to the first film because the first film did have more going for it - a bigger budget, more experienced director and screenwriters, more talented cast (Julia, James Fox, Miranda Richardson and Ben Miles sadly do not return), better script and higher production values.

""Prince and Me 2"", however, isn't totally devoid of charm. Luke Mably is back and still as handsome as ever. His character IS more serious and more grown up - after all, he is king now. Kam Heskin (who I did like in the modern day ""Pride & Prejudice"") replaces Julia as Paige Morgan and does what the script demands of her. The always likeable Jonathan Firth (Colin's brother) is a fair replacement for Ben Miles as Soren eventhough his role is fairly small. Clemency Burton-Hill is quite good as the conniving Princess Kirsten and the majority of locations from the first film are back in the sequel.

Instead of the romantic drama that ""Prince & Me"" was, this version is more of a romantic comedy. In fact, I couldn't help comparing it to ""The Princess Diaries 2"" somehow.  After all, this film is about a nobleman relative who introduces a 'complication' to the royal succession and brings forward his younger relative (his daughter) as a more suitable wife to the prince.  ""TPD 2"" is very similar except that the nobleman puts forward his younger relative (his nephew) as a more suitable successor to the throne.

This film has its faults, of course. There are a few scenes that are a tad silly or corny (several comedies are guilty of this, unfortunately). The actors in this film simply do not have the experience and talent that the first film had. The screenplay could use some work. I also agree that though Kam Heskin's Paige is not bad, this Paige is just not the same intelligent, ambitious, down-to-earth and no-nonsense Paige that we fell in love with in the first film. I really wish the filmmakers made more of an effort to follow the story thread and characterizations of the first film.

All this aside, I still liked this sequel to ""Prince and Me."" It was nice to see Paige and Prince Edvard's relationship reach its conclusion and Luke Mably is always a pleasure to watch.  If you like romantic comedies with the sort of slapstick humor that ""Princess Diaries 2"" or ""Ella Enchanted"" have, for instance, then this movie is worth a watch.  Lower your expectations and don't expect it to be exactly like the first ""Prince and Me"" and you won't be disappointed.",1155340800,19,2713,4.600414078674948
2459933,4,B000CDSS0Y,"I thought this sequel was actually nice.  It has a good plot line and brings to a close the courtship of Paige and Eddie.  In spite of the film's low budget (which is probably why none on the big stars are in the sequel), it moves right along and is fun to watch.  Granted, the computerized butterflies are a bit strange, but overall, is a well put together flick.",1150934400,8,364,4.246376811594203

2459935,4,B000CDSS0Y,"After reading the reviews about this movie, I have come to the conclusion that many people hate it simply because almost all of the actors have changed from the original film.  Apparently, they are used to the actors from the first film, and can't accept that someone new can play the part.

Have you ever seen a play in a theater?  Each time a play is redone, there is a NEW cast, with NEW characters, and the new actors bring something different to their roles than the actors that went before them did.  Having new actors actually makes the production more interesting!

I watched this movie knowing that most of the actors were different, but I didn't let it bother me.  I enjoyed the movie--it wasn't five stars, but it wasn't one either (which most people seem to be giving it!).  It is a movie I can watch with my kids and not be worried about questionable content.  It is a movie that made me smile--and I felt good after watching it.  If you like light romantic movies, then give this one a try.  And if you have seen the first film, don't let the fact that there are different actors in the second keep you from enjoying yourself!",1148342400,11,1140,4.411483253588517

The whole time I watched this movie I stayed confused.  You would think the writers would stay true to the original but they did not.  First off, ""Paige"" was not even ""Paige.""  This Kem girl was not down to earth and practical like Julia Stiles was in the first one.  Julia brought this ""simple"" yet beautiful look to the role of Paige - easy to see her become queen.  The new Paige was just plain ditzy!  Second, the king seemed to be knocking on deaths door in the first movie, but was miraculously healed in this one!  The queen wasn't regal, Edvard's sister was non existent - along with Paige's bothers, and when Paige's parents came to the wedding they weren't even right.  What a terrible movie!!  My daughter and I loved the first one - this one was just plain awful!  Don't waste your money or time!

Yes, It was disappointing that everyone except Edvard (Luke Mably) was gone, but after a while I forgot that most of the original cast members were missing. Kam Heskin did a  good job as Paige Morgan. Both leads had great chemistry, and played off each other well. I would recommend this movie.",1147392000,20,581,4.225225225225225

A wholesome storyline, pleasant to watch nevertheless, compared to all the sordid ones:  murders, etc.

As always Luke is cute or a ""hunk"", even though he's skinny; & he's a real good actor.  I won't be surprised if he becomes a big star sooner than later.  Will probably watch every movie he makes.

Wrong...the actress that replaced the role was all wrong for the part and what's worse so were most of the other actors that replaced the rest of the cast.  Luke Malby is a fine actor, but the scrpit didn't help him.  It was a poor plot and it seemed as if they changed the personalities of many of the characters.

Our perky, smart, independent Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles) who really deserved to marry a King has become an almost ditzy blonde who gets by mostly on her looks and doesn't deserve even to be in med school. The acting (apart from Luke Mably) is amateurish. The story line is predictable, boring and trite.

Fun insues when a former childhood playmate, Princess Kirsten, and her father come to visit, bringing to light a little known law.  Trouble insues over the remaining time before the wedding.

At first the change of actors was very off - putting, but soon I didn't notice it any longer.  Jonathan Firth was very good, Kam Heskin, while no Julia Stiles, still pulled her role off well.  Luke was charming as Edvard.  Mayrim D'Abo became a believable queen towards the end, bringing glimpses of Queen Rosalind from the first movie.

The only thing I couldn't get around was why King Haarald wasn't still King.  In the first movie, he was very ill.  You could understand why he turned the throne over. But in part two, he was a healthy man in his prime.

8097959,2,B000CDSS0Y,"1. This movie is not a sequel. First of all, every single actor has been changed except for Edvard.

2. The new Paige is such a different character to the one in the first movie. Paige in the first movie left the palace because she just wanted to realize her dreams and travel. She was a very independent and a strong down to earth girl who didn't really worry about looks. Her style was laid back and not very girly at all. In this second movie Paige is a total girly girl who curls hair and wears silk robes to bed. The whole enchanting part of the first movie is that paige was so average and far from girly royalty princess material that it was actually touching that the prince fell for her heart, not because she seems like some hot girl or like she was a perfect fit to be royalty. She was literally just a simple farm girl with short hair who would fight with her big brothers. This new paige doesn't seem like such an average person she is actually gorgeous and always fixed up which makes the story less touching and romantic.

3. Another thing is this movie literally is a ripped off story from the Princess Diaries 2 but the quality sucks! The script is not great and the wardrobe choices are horrible. Their chemistry wasn't there. I'm not sure if that was because of the actors or because of the script but it just wasn't a great follow up to a great first movie. They obviously changed the roles up but it is the prince needs to find a spouse before a certain deadline in order to assume the throne.

4. The order of everything is so weird. How is she gonna leave him because he doesn't know if he would give up the throne to be with her (her being a ""norm"") yet she sees he got engaged like a few days later and decides to find a loophole to get married to him. The Paige from the first movie would have been hurt by this news and decided to throw herself into her schoolwork and do her own thing and achieve her goals and have an awesome life. She would have had more pride than this new Paige who is basically just finding a way for the prince to be with her without him doing anything to win her back. Only point where he does something to win her back is after she has found a way to make it easy for him to marry her without having to give up the throne WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON WHY SHE LEFT IN THE FRIST PLACE",1506816000,,2332,4.143487858719647
