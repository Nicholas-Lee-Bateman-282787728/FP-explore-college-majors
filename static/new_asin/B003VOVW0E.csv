4209676,5,B003VOVW0E,"I don't have a bunch of technical things to say about the DVD Set itself. I buy them to watch, not to critique like a science project. I watched this series on Youtube before buying the DVD Set. I try to do that to avoid purchasing a bad Anime set. I liked this story because it was not drawn out too long, and the story unfolds in an unusual style. You don't learn how they got their powers till the second episode, and it honestly works for me that way. They plunge you right into the action, and then take you along for the ride. The characters themselves are what interested me the most, because they all seem to unfold themselves as the story progresses. They're not always fearless and perfect, and they don't always save the person that needs saving --but they try. My only complaint is that there were other characters that needed more fleshing out and the ending to the show leaves it open for a future return to tell another tale. I honestly wish they would do an OVA or something to give us that conclusion but I'm not holding my breath for one.

The kids kind of reminded me of the cast of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series in that they find themselves in this world of mysticism and horror, and they do their best to deal with it. They try to protect each other and grow through the series. There are some heart wrenching moments and I think I liked that best of all. If It makes any difference to anyone, I watched the series first, then I bought the DVD.",1266192000,7,1471,4.2913669064748206
4209677,3,B003VOVW0E,"To confess, I'm not a big ""horror anime"" buff but typically enjoy series based on successful video game franchises.  As such it was with a blend of expectations that I set out to review Tokyo Majin, The Complete Series.

Interestingly enough, it appears as though Funimation has actually released this previous ADV Films' property as two individual season sets and is now planning a complete series box set, which contains all 26 episodes of the show.

Released across four discs (in a double-sized clamshell case), The Complete Series consists of episodes 1-26 and comes in at a total runtime of 650 minutes. It wears an appropriate TV MA (mature, 17+) rating due to violence, gore, and supernatural imagery.

Language options are standard sub & dub with both an English dub (Dolby 5.1 Digital Surround) and original Japanese soundtrack (stereo) & the choice of English subtitled if so inclined to turn them on.

The story goes something like this: The mystical energy flow that maintains order to the world (the Dragon Stream) has been disrupted.  As a direct result of this disturbance, a whole bunch incidents have erupted across Tokyo, including a surge of deaths, plagues of zombies, and six teenagers (who want nothing more than to live the simple life of students) suddenly gaining mystical powers.

It's tough to put the show into a single category; it would be foolish to downplay the supernatural/ mystical elements as they are catalyst that drives the plot but in terms of delivery and pacing, Tokyo Majin may more closely resemble an action series.  In other words yes there are some moody environments throughout and attempts at depth by establishing conflicted pasts for a few of the main characters, the series is really the medium in which to showcase super-human action sequences.  Teenagers who can fire glowing mystical arrows from a bow or a tough guy who can uppercut through hordes of swarming monsters is going to be good onscreen fun, bottom line.

Viewers can expect episodes loaded with gruesome creatures, flashy magical effects, and fight scenes loaded to the hilt with animation detail.  For the most part, the formula works so long as you go into the show without expectations of a deep psychological thriller element.  This is superhero fun against the legions of the underworld first and foremost; drama and mystery serve only to compliment the greater mission at hand.

The visuals are pretty solid throughout with just the right texturing (and gore elements) to make for some truly nasty nasties and the environmental tones are nice and gritty as well.  The sound work is solid for the most part, with eerie notes working nicely into the background and slick tension-building strings when the mood calls for them.  Unfortunately the hard rock anthem done by ACID at the opening and closing of each episode comes off as a bit misguided until you realize that it is the theme for the evil rock star villain later on in the prose.

In all, this is a show where the visuals and effects certainly outshine the writing but perhaps that's exactly what makes it so unique.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a little supernatural butt whipping by some everyday kids.  It's also really decent of Funimation to consider their fans in deciding to release a full 26-episode box set release for little more than the individual seasons have been selling for until now.",1254355200,13,3398,4.921190893169878

What I got was an awesome and fun ride with a great cast of characters and awesome looking monsters. What really drove this one home was a few things first off I loved that our heroes went out of their way to save and redeem the possessed people being used by the demons and even try to save the demons some actually joined their side of the fight which I thought was cool. Another big reason was the character design all the characters looked Asian and were drawn to look that way. And the last big point for me was how fluid the animation was the fights were well put together and easy to follow.

4209703,2,B003VOVW0E,"Tokyo Majin is an anime about a group of high school students that suddenly acquire magical powers.

Pros:
- Cool concept
- Some decent fight scenes
- Interesting story

Cons: (there are plenty)
- Too many characters
- Lack of character depth
- Lack of Fluidity
- Cliche Ending

Tokyo Majin is a story-driven anime and falls short in that it lacks anymore depth than that. The episodes transition poorly, from scene to scene, which can also be said about the episode transitions. Tokyo Majin doesn't flow very well ... it jumps scene to scene and sometimes it'll jump to a flashback (without the use of any traditional flashback techniques, such as black and white or brown filters). Tokyo Majin lacks depth because there are NO character developments at all, none of the characters grow or mature ... what you see in the beginning is what you get in the end. Plus, there are way too many characters. It's like crowding the Avengers, X-Men, & Fantastic Four all in one movie. Similar to the other reviews, reviewers stated the characters appeared ""one-dimensional"" ... well, that's because there are just way too many characters, which doesn't give enough screen time to a specific character, hence we don't learn enough about a character. Expect a cliche ending that you've seen a thousand times before in other animes.

The bottom line is that Tokyo Majin will maintain your attention due to it's plot-driven direction. Tokyo Majin does hold entertainment value, but fails to connect to its audience on an emotional or contemplative level. After finishing Tokyo Majin, you most likely won't be deep in thought. Tokyo Majin will not surprise you, but it will leave you with a shrug, followed by a ""Eh, could have been better.""",1353283200,,1727,4.863945578231292
4209704,5,B003VOVW0E,This is one of thoes rare titles tht just leaves you wanting more and more.

4209706,4,B003VOVW0E,"Series was decent, characters were what made the series interesting, the stories themselves were ok.  First season was good, second raised the stakes and I found it more enjoyable, especially since the major villains were more.

4209707,4,B003VOVW0E,"High Schoolers, Zombies, Demons, Buddhist Monks, Evil Sorcerers, Chinese Gangbangers, Taoist Wizards, Shinto Priests, Ninja, idiot detectives, and beyond.  What do they all have in common? Apparently, they all live in Tokyo.  Tokyo Majin Gakuen Kenpucho Tou, released in America as Tokyo Majin, is (needless to say) an interesting anime series.  No, if you've seen Bastard! then you know that, under the right circumstances, starting a show with its final episode can work very well.  It's a risk, but if it works it draws in the audience like little else can, especially if you manage not to spoil your secrets in that first episode.  This isn't exactly what Tokyo Majin does, but it is as close as anything I've seen.  Instead of actually putting the last episode first, Tokyo Majin`s introductory episode acts almost like a summary of the entire show.  The episode is impossible to follow, but it tells you everything that you're getting yourself into.  My personal jury is still out as to whether or not it is effective.

Overall: 4.0 (8.5)/10

Ok, this is going to be an interesting review, because I like Tokyo Majin, but I know that the things I like about the show will be things that most people hate.  So, I'm going to try to be objective, and still defend my appreciation of the show.  In all honesty, I don't see a lot of people liking this show much...actually I don't see a lot of people getting past the first three episodes.  That being said, I really think this is a fun show to watch, and I encourage all of you to stick it out if you think the show sounds interesting.  From the first sentence of this review you can tell that Tokyo Majin mixes a lot of genres together, which is generally not effective outside of spoofs like Martian Successor Nadesice, FLCL,  and Gintama.  I personally think that Tokyo Majin pulls it off fairly well, although it could be better, and that it does so while maintaining a serious, and sometimes even dark tone.

Writing and Art: 7.0 (9.0)/10

The art in Tokyo Majin is beautiful.  It uses a lot of very thin lines, which gives the entire show an almost gaunt appearance - this plays very well to the shows darker tone.  The writing is strong, if you can follow it (more on this is the plot section).

Characters: 4.0 (7.0)/10

The show features a lot of characters, but only a few main characters.  Tokyo Majin focuses on five highschool students who suddenly and mysteriously acquire special powers that they have to use to fight off demons that are invading Tokyo.  However, outside of these main characters, each of whom is well developed over the series, are a whole host of secondary characters - friends, enemies, in-between, just plain weird, and people who we have no clue why they're even there, but make for an interesting backdrop to the show as a whole.  There's one episode that ends with a random middle-aged man talking at the screen.  Again, I love the sheer number of secondary characters - some quite well-developed, and some not developed at all (random middle-aged man).  I know that a lot of people will get lost in the sheer number of characters, and decide that the show isn't worth their time.  In this they're probably right, one rule of writing that I love to break is `the fewer characters the better' (to a point obviously).

World: 6.5 (8.5)/10

The world of Tokyo Majin is, obviously modern Tokyo.  And a dream world, bits and pieces of medieval Japan, a few random spots in the Japanese country-side, etc.  All in all the world is fairly well-developed, but not to the point that it becomes a character in and of itself.

Plot and Content: 3.0 (9.5)/10

I already gave you the basic plot of the show - magic high schoolers battle demons for the city of Tokyo.  However, this is what makes it frustrating/interesting.  The writers of the show don't give you the plot as such.  In fact the show takes on a puzzle like aspect as the writers had viewers obscured plot points, and not in the correct order.  In most shows I would call this sloppy writing, but in Tokyo Majin it is done with an elegance that makes it obviously purposeful, and I really like it.  Honestly, I've had a lot of fun trying to figure out what the hell is actually going on in this show.  In this way it reminds me a little bit of FLCL, except that the latter keeps the viewer actively looking for a plot where none exists.  Again, I love FLCL.  If you're like me, and having to focus on the show to figure out what's going on sounds like fun, then you should give it a try.  If this sounds ridiculously frustrating, then you should probably avoid it.  If you're worried about content, that is pretty simple - lots of violence and a little fan service. Other than the weird spinal cord breast monster thing in episode two you don't have much to worry about in the way of fan service...and that actually isn't something that I would consider fan service, but I know some people (very, very strange people) who would, so I thought I'd mention it.

Pacing: ??/10

I honestly don't know how to rate the pacing in Tokyo Majin.  The action moves very quickly, but plot points are given so out of sequence that sometimes it seems to not be moving at all.  I will say this, I haven't been bored with it.

Commentary: 4/10

Demons are bad, revenge is bad, dedication and willpower are good.  Tokyo Majin isn't exactly filled with deep social commentary.  The fun in the show comes from the puzzle of putting it together more than from the lessons learned from it.

Conclusion:

Well, there you go.  I honestly don't know whether to recommend the show or not.  I like it a lot, and if you like the idea of a storyline puzzle that you have to put together as the show moves along, then it's a good bet that you'll enjoy this show.  I honestly don't see it appealing to a lot of people, but apparently it was popular enough to get ported over from Japan, so maybe I'm wrong.",1325894400,,5918,4.5406427221172025
4209708,2,B003VOVW0E,"I watched the first episode thinking it was going to be a good anime with good action that will be coming up soon, but this anime is so lame.  Some episodes storyline are too slow and vague and it bounces too much to different scenes at the wrong time.  The story entirely is ok, but could've been better.  Don't even get me talking about the action...LAME!  You don't even get to see ANY action!  When you think it's going to be a good fight, the scene cuts to another fight (which you ALSO won't get to see).  The story is all too original.  Everybody wants to protect someone and the tough guy always seems tough at first, but then ends up sucking later on.  The two main girls are annoying as well.  Especially, Aoi.  The whole time I was watching the anime, I kept praying she would get killed, but it looks like that's not going to happen.  The only one I was able to tolerate was Tatsuma.  Daigo and Sakurai are plain o' annoying and Kyouichi is alright.  Don't buy this anime, if you want to see it, rent it.  But trust me, don't waste your time on it.",1307923200,,1060,4.235
4209709,4,B003VOVW0E,"I watched a few episodes online and liked it so I picked it up. (The CHEAP price didn't hurt either)
Four hero's fight demons and a looming mega bad guy is pulling the strings, a story we've all heard, but Tokyo Majin does a good job of spinning the story its own unique way.
The fight scenes are well done and the story is pretty good as ""dark"" ones go but not easily picked up because the big story arc doesn't reveal itself till the last 4 episodes, leaving the you wondering in the beginning where this thing is going. The voices are well done and the conversations between characters have a natural sort of feeling to them and you generally are held in attention through the whole series without the use of cheap tricks.
The show doesn't get ""cheap pop"" from overzealous fan-service but does make full use of the english language with some profanity laced tirades that you wouldn't find on some cable shows and it does feature some very graphic fight scenes. (Be warned in the final battle there are broken bones coming from every direction)
FYI, the final 2 episodes are ""extras"", but amount to nothing more than a clip show and an episode that would slot in near the end of the story but is inconsequential, no other extras besides previews.
It's not a dynamic show (meaning I'd watch it again but not for like 6 months or so), but it is somewhat unique with a good variety of characters and intriguing story.
The $19.99 price for a 26 episodes is an unheard of deal in this day and age and would be well worth the money.",1303862400,,1528,4.421985815602837

After talking about it with a friend I decided to buy this to see if I'd actually enjoy it. I didn't. The animation is pretty solid for the first couple episodes and I thought the awkward episode order was a breath of fresh air. That is until the show just ended, yea... it doesn't have an ending ain't that something...

4209713,4,B003VOVW0E,"Maybe I'm slightly unbiased, I didn't know this was based off of a video game.  But I also liked other anime such as ""Devil May Cry"", ""Sands of Destruction"" and comic based ""Witchblade""... and never played the games or read the comic.  I don't mind if different formats are different, like movies/books/video games, I like nuances, it leaves the original work special; I also enjoy when an anime starts off with an episode that doesn't character build or develop plot, it just starts out with a HUGE bang; the later episodes explain the actions/reactions of the characters quite nicely.  I get a kick out of Miss Alucard and ""Anko"", the reporter.  The backgrounds, character design, and the fluidity of animation I was actually quite stunned by, I thought it wonderful.

At least for the first Dark Arts story arc of 14 episodes, the first four episodes of Martial Fist story arc and the 26th thank-you episode titled ""Romeo & Juliet"" which felt like it should have come after the first half of the Martial Fist story arc.  Not sure WHAT the heck happened to the production quality and character design of the 19th - 25th episodes; it's like it was passed off to a second-rate studio, some of the characters are somewhat unrecognizeable at first, nor did the animation flow as nicely (or at all).  That was my biggest pet-peeve.

I can deal with piecing a story together, I quite like that aspect; a good flashforward, several flashbacks... the pieces all go together (eventually); especially with the awkwardly pieced together ""Walk Onwards, Children"" episode, it showed some insightful relations (like why the archer girl couldn't use her right arm).  The first 'season' of 14 episodes had me wanting to watch them straight through, and it's always a good sign when not only do I want to watch the season again, but watch an episode again right away; the first half is that good in my opinion.

The second half of Martial Fist (Stars of Fate) goes a bit off the deep end; with the ho-hum storyline, bad animation, I could have skipped the last story arc for the most part.  And yes, not only is there unanswered questions, there's characters that end up being vampires -- did not see that coming, and have NO idea what it added to the story.  Maybe I should  play the video game?  Heh.  But overall, the first half of this series is incredible and recommended.",1292544000,2,2362,4.7128953771289535
4209714,3,B003VOVW0E,"If you've just started watching the first episode and come here to see if there is some prequel series you are missing - just keep watching, the second episode clears everything up (and really should have been the first episode).

Mysterious transfer student, Tatsuma Hiyuu, and delinquent student, Kyouichi Houraiji, along with their schoolmates, strong guy who cooks, annoying archery girl, and annoying helpless good girl, fight the 'Reborn Dead' and other monsters. Apparently they all have psychic powers, though it is never too clear on exactly how they have these powers or how their power works. The series is split into two arcs; the first they fight against a creepy, probably insane, guy with interesting make-up, and in the second arc they go against his boss.

The storyline is a little confusing and not quite clear, but despite the extremely 2-dimensional stereotypical characters, this series was actually pretty fun. The storyline was pretty dumb at times, but it did manage flashes of originality that made it worth finishing. The characters never really improve, or get stronger or more interesting, but you learn to just accept them and enjoy the action. But if you choose this show just because of the ""Mysterious transfer student"", prepare to be disappointed. When it finally sort of explains his past, it is brief and not very interesting. That is my biggest complaint about this series - it sets itself up for big revelations and really fails in the delivery - i.e. one character is introduced as though she was disposable, but it is then hinted that she will be important later on. Then she does almost nothing and what little she did do, I didn't understand the significance of. I still don't quite understand the motivations of any of the bad guys either.

The art is decent. The character designs are not too bad, but some of the settings are really well done. The destruction of various parts of the city was always fun to watch. I don't remember the music at all, but it was probably ok. I watched it in Japanese, and the voice cast did a good job. Nothing stellar, but not weak.

For the price, this is a pretty good series to pick up. As long as you do not expect greatness and just want something entertaining, you should give this series a try.

My biggest issue is with the timeline. The first episode jumps right in, complete with the death of side characters that I thought were main characters. Then the story jumps backward, and everyone is alive, but not friends.  So things go forward from this point,  but there are battles that aren't finished, arguments that apparently started off camera, like the art dealer guy says that he told the students to fight together. When? This anime seems to just pick up whenever it wants. It's got good enough points for 4 stars, but feels like pieces are missing, and that's annoying.",1486684800,,732,4.895161290322581

8406917,5,B003VOVW0E,"Even tho the series ended too quickly,it was still great. The characters weren't boring or bland. It kept you wanting more, and by the end of the series i felt like it covered what it needed. Some moments were tear jerks while others were action packed. This is one i can watch over a dozen times and still feel the need to watch it again. Definitely a good buy!",1453593600,,362,4.260869565217392
8406918,3,B003VOVW0E,"Tokyo Majin starts out as dreary, gray, and pretty depressing. The series starts out in tons of confusion. The first four of five episodes are pretty much like this. Later on the series starts coming together and so do the characters. Later on there becomes more depth in the story and an interesting plot. Tokyo Majin is split up into two story arcs that both begin confusing and end with you wanting more.

There is amazing character depth throughout the series and tons of progress that isn't afraid to turn dark with an example being when one main character's parents dies and leading him to insanity. There is so much emotion and angst throughout the series as seeing all of the characters are high school students.

The art style is ""very unique"" and the character designs aren't all that great with their faces coming apart during fight scenes or when they're running which is quite unfortunate because there are quite a lot of these in Tokyo Majin.

The series begins with a monster of the week ordeal and ends with leaving something special in your heart. The music the show is well, pretty depressing and includes some J - Rock. The art style and character designs are awful. The character depth and story are great and interesting. Tokyo Majin combines elements of shonen, drama, and horror. So what do you think, a gem of post modern anime or more on the lines of a forgetful OVA.",1446076800,,1392,4.650406504065041
