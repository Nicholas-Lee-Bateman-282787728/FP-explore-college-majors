8169477,1,B0007WFUT2,"As the other reviewer noted, this movie doesn't have much to recommend it. I would add that it has a great deal of subtitles, where the dialogue is primarily guttoral noises, and the picture quality looks like it was screen captured from a bad TV in a dorm room 20 years ago. I would rather take my chances on a random pick at the rental store by picking a row, shelf, and count how many spaces from the left (take that home instead). As my wife put it, it could be a good movie to use to dump an unwanted girlfriend. She wouldn't want to be around you if this is what you watch.",1236988800,,579,4.087719298245614
8169478,2,B0007WFUT2,"If you like VERY VERY cheap movies. This is the movie for you. Being a fan of B-Movies I thought I would give this one a try. I was let down quite a bit. I guess its kind of enjoyable in a weired way. I guess because it sorta feels like one of those cheesey adventure shows I used to watch as a kid. (Land of the Lost comes to mind)The acting is horrible. The dinosaurs look weird, almost nothing like dinosaurs. Almost all of the backgrounds were mapped on a blue screen and the characters kind of float on the screen. The main bad guy is a square robot who has a speach probelm of some kind. Thats about it for the details of the movie. Now for the actual story.

This movie had a kinda hard story line to follow. From what I gathered there is a planet ruled by the ""Grand Automaton"" he is like a dictator. Every year they have an event in which dinosaurs fight eachother to the death. Thats about all I could muster. The main charcter is played by the director. (he sounds like he is reading his lines thourgh the whole movie)He and his friend go on a little quest for some reason. Sorry if this review kinda sucks its just that the movie is very vague and sorta doesnt make any sense. I have watched in twice in one year and im on the fence between Hating it and thinking its just a below average B-movie that really makes no sense. You may want to give it a rent (if you can actually find it) before you buy it I opted to buy it and was mostly unhappy.",1156032000,,1457,4.076655052264808
