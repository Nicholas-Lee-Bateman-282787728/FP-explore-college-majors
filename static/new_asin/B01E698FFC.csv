7730709,5,B01E698FFC,"Written and directed by John Carney, who also did the delightful films Once and Begin Again, Sing Street is a wonderful little indie film from Ireland that deals with two of Carney's recurring themes:  song and the creative process, and the joy of possibility. In this particular film, it centers around a fifteen-year-old boy named Conor who impulsively decides to form a band to impress a girl.

It's 1985 in Dublin, where Conor (marvelously played by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) lives with his increasingly dysfunctional parents Robert (Aiden Gillen) and Penny (Maria Doyle Kennedy) and his amiable slacker older brother Brendan (Jack Reynor) and his more reserved sister Ann (Kelly Thornton).  The family is financially stressed by Robert's business troubles, and the film opens with Robert giving Conor the bad news that, to save money, he's taking Conor out of his semi-posh private school and sending him to the local free state-school, the Christian Brothers School on Synge Street. His first day is ominously bad, with the headmaster, Brother Baxter (Don Wycherly), taking him to task for not wearing black shoes (which he can't afford), with things getting worse when he gets harassed by a school bully named Barry (Ian Kenny).  But the encounter with Barry gets him the attention of another student, a diminutive but budding entrepreneur named Darren (Ben Carolan) who has his own hand-drawn business cards. It's while talking to Brendan that Conor first sees a strikingly beautiful and mysterious girl (Lucy Boynton) standing across the street from the school, looking as if she's waiting for someone. Moved by an irresistible impulse to meet her, Conor goes over and awkwardly starts up a conversation with the girl, whose name he discovers is Raphina.  Desperate to make some kind of impression on this girl, and being told by her that she's a model, Conor impulsively asks Raphina if she'd be interested in appearing in a video that his band is making - spontaneously making up both the existence of a band he doesn't have and a video they aren't making. But the gambit seems to work, and Conor leaves promising to tell her when the shoot will be.  Upon returning to where Darren is waiting, Conor tells the startled Darren ""We need to start a band!"" and asks if he knows anyone who can play.  And things start rolling from that point on.

Highly, highly recommended as a marvelous little film that works on so many levels and makes you remember what it was to be that age when everything in life seemed possible and often surprisingly was.",1463097600,21,2547,4.934579439252336
7730710,5,B01E698FFC,"Loved this movie, an incredibly sweet coming of age story set in Ireland. The music was straight out of high school, and hearing Joe Jackson nearly made me cry.  Also such a bonus to see Vera Bates from Downtown Abbey and Tommy Carciretti from the Wire as the parents of the young lead character. Super talented cast . My 16 year old son now has a new appreciation for the music I grew up with and has been listening to the Clash since we saw it.  Highly recommend this super enjoyable film",1462665600,,490,4.315217391304348
7730711,4,B01E698FFC,"""Sing Street"" (2016 release from Ireland; 105 min.) brings the story of Conor, a 15 yr. old boy. As the movie opens, we are reminded that this is ""Dublin 1985"", and we see Conor strumming the guitar in his bedroom. At dinner time, Conor's parents inform him and his older brother and younger sister that Conor is being transferred to a Catholic school to save money. Conor has a hard time adjusting to the new school environment and is picked on by another boy. Then one day, Conor notices a girl across the street. He gathers all his courage and asks her to be in a video for his band. When she says ""okay"", Conor realizes that he needs to put together a band, and on the double! At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest music-related film from writer-producer-director John Carney (Once; Begin Again). In fact, one can make the argument that ""Sing Street"" is the spiritual prequel to Once, as ""Sing Street"" looks at the life of 15 and 16 yr olds as they are starting to make decisions for themselves and trying to make something of their lives (Once takes place some years later). And what better motivation to start a band than to impress a girl! Carney nails the musical landscape of the mid-80s in Ireland perfectly. ""Thursday, 7 pm, It's Top of the Pops!"" screams a voice on TV, and we witness Duran Duran's ""Rio"" video. When Conor struggles to recruit like-minded kids for his band (called Sing Street), he posts fliers, ""Futurist Band Forming"". And how might such a futurist band sound? It sounds remarkably like Duran Duran-meets-Franz Ferdinand (check out first song ""The Riddle of the Model""). While much of the movie is light-hearted, Carney does not forget to shed light on some darker aspects of Irish society (mass-migration to England; stoner older brother is college drop-out, and of course the role of religion (Catholic, specifically). But in the end, it's all about the music. Carney co-wrote and co-plays on all the new songs with Gary Clark, and Once star Glen Hansard is listed in the movie's end credits as one of the studio musicians. Last but certainly not least, props to the performances given by the two leads: Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as Conor, and Lucy Boynton as 16 yr. old Raphina. Ah, to be young and having your whole life ahead of you... Bottom line: this movie is sheer exuberance.

""Sing Street"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was PACKED, I am happy to report (perhaps the lousy weather had something to do with it). I had a smile on my face for much of the movie. If you are looking for a feel-good movie that happens to showcase a lot of great music, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Sing Street"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1462665600,2,2943,4.603809523809524
7730712,5,B01E698FFC,"We saw this movie last night. I hadn't heard of it until I saw an interview with Lucy Boynton on Jimmy Kimmel from a couple of nights ago. When I heard the theme was 80's music, my ears perked up! I was so happy to find it playing nearby. What a fantastic movie! Very well written, well rounded characters, and the casting was excellent. The original music was fantastic, and I look forward to receiving the soundtrack. The first thing I thought of once the movie was over was that I needed to have this movie in my collection once it is released. This movie kind of reminded me of ""Billy Elliot"". I highly recommend this movie. It shot up to the very top of my most favorite movies list!",1462406400,,688,4.3
7730713,5,B01E698FFC,"My 14 year old and I saw this at a screening before it came out.  We loved, loved the movie!  Waiting for it to come to theaters near us so we can see it again.  I was smiling through the movie.",1462406400,,194,3.682926829268293
7730714,5,B01E698FFC,"When it comes to films about music, specifically MAKING music, Europe does it way better than America. You won't find anything cringe-worthy (That Thing You Do, Pitch Perfect) or pretentious (Moulin Rouge, Almost Famous) in this outing by writer/director John Carney. What you will find is a film with a big heart, a film that engenders incessant laughter and a film that stands as a perfect metaphor to never lose sight of ones ambitions. I realize its only April but this might just be the best film of 2016, and I will be so bold as to say this will garner some award nominations next year.

If you grew up in the 80s, if you adore New Wave music, if youve ever been in a band, if youve ever written God awful poetry about someone, if youve ever seen yourself as anti-establishment, you will LOVE this movie!!! The plot couldn't be anymore simple - In 1985, a Dublin teenager (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) forms a rock 'n' roll band to win the heart of an aspiring model (Lucy Boynton). What enfolds afterward will pull at your heartstrings and incite both indignation and joy. Walsh-Peelo, in his first role, bears an innocence that I haven't seen since Bud Corts debut as Harold in Harold & Maude. The way he carries his characters progression from awkward underdog to local legend is the reason we love these kinds of movies and, without spoiling anything, the way we understand why people (especially children and teenagers) are inspired to create art.

I could write paragraphs and go on and on about how perfect each character was, as well as the actors and actresses who inhabited them. Mark McKenna is a dead ringer for a young version of Ultravoxs Midge Ure (with glasses), Games Of Thrones Aiden Gillen is wonderful as the downtrodden father, but it is Lucy Boyntons turn as Raphina that will absolutely break your heart.

I had the privilege to view this movie at the Nashville Film Festival last week and it was an awe-inspiring experience. I implore EVERYONE to get out and see it when the wide release hits theatres at the end of May. As the end credits rolled, I turned to my friend and told her I hadnt seen such an amazing film about music since Once premiered about a decade ago. Without missing a beat, she said, Um. Well you realize this is the same guy who wrote and directed THAT film, right? Haha! And there you have it!",1461715200,33,2337,4.586124401913875

Filled with radio worthy original songs that make me want to buy the soundtrack.  Kitschy full circle inclusion of Maria Doyle Kennedy who starred in ""The Commitments"" (also about young people and music in Ireland in the 80's) as the mother.

7730724,5,B01E698FFC,"My favorite genre of movies is of the rock and roll variety--anything from A Hard Day's Night to Spinal Tap. Sing Street is one that only came onto my radar on a transatlantic flight. This is a brilliant contribution to the ""let's do a show"" variety. The actors are all good and especially effective because aside from Glen Hansard (oh and thanks to Bono and The Edge in the final small print list of credits), everyone was fresh and perfectly cast. The script captures youthful optimism and the drive of the artist. This is well worth seeing and captures well the 80s vibe and its voices that were looking for their own authenticity at the time.",1519689600,,646,4.577586206896552

Put funny, inspiring, touching, dark, light (happy/sad!), creative, and hopeful in a blender, hit mix,  and this is what you get.  Hard to believe this movie didn't get more notice, but I know I've watched it at least 5 times and told all my friends to do the same (and everyone who has seen it loves it).

I won't go into plot or any detail as that has been done better by others here, but rent, buy, Netflx, or just see it by any means necessary. If you don't cry happy tears in last scene I'll refund your money. Clearly the best of Carney's music trilogy and hoping there is a part 2 to find out what happens ""in the future""...",1517788800,,669,4.203125

7730729,5,B01E698FFC,"Great music, characters, plot, and acting. If you grew up in the 80s or enjoy new wave music, there is a huge sense of nostalgia. The only thing was the lead female didn't seem like a teenager and too old for the male lead, but that could have been intentional as her character definitely had to grow up faster then the rest. A good movie for a Saturday night.",1514764800,,360,4.231884057971015

7730731,5,B01E698FFC,Absolutely loved this movie! I thought it was very well written and put together.  Great hearing so many songs from the 80's.  Smiled seeing the lads dress up to take their roles in the band seriously.  The school reminded me of what it was like going to a French-Catholic school in the mid 70's.  This movie kept a smile on my face pretty much during the entire film (granted I did get a bit watery eyed a couple of times).,1513814400,,424,4.2625

7730742,5,B01E698FFC,"One of the best movies of 2016. John Carney's best movie yet, blending what worked best in his previous work into this masterpiece. This movie took me back to my childhood in the United States - I never thought about how the same music was influencing kids around the world, and that revelation is what has stayed with me most since seeing the film. The story itself is an idealistic love story, where the characters are at an age where they feel invincible and that anything is possible. It's good to be reminded of that innocence, and to reflect on who you were and what things shaped who you've become. This movie shows that no matter where one grows up, love and music are universal.",1503532800,,687,4.504

There is good humor in this movie and it's upbeat despite the surroundings that include classic bullies an and a moronic teacher.  One could argue that the band matured extremely quickly but that's all part of the fun.

7730771,5,B01E698FFC,"****may contain spoilers****

Ive had Netflix for a few years.  I watched a couple of movies on it.  I never seem to use it.  I started a few weeks ago, after seeing a comedian did four exclusive movies for them.  Last night, I looked up top movies on Netflix.  I went to a site and this movie was on there.  Of all the movies, my eyes were drawn to the name and the image that was shown.

The movie is set in the 80s.  I believe it is shot in the UK.  It is all about a guy, who sees something he wants.  He finds a way to get close to it.  Then though, in order to take it to the next step, he has to form a band.

The movie shows the effects from that.

There are a few reasons that this movie is great and has become one of my all-time favorites.

First, it is not shot in the U.S.  That is great.  I do not have to look at stuff that I see every day.  It is like a new world and everything is new and amazing.

Second, so many movies today, have a story, that is dulled down, with so much filler material, that is not important at all to the story, that the actual main story gets dragged down.  The people that made this, knew what it was.  They did not try to do more with it than they should.  It was fantastic.

Third, the characters are very likeable.  I wanted all of them to succeed.

Four, the acting is really good.  I have no clue, who any of these people are.  But, man, they were great.  I got so into the story.

Five, the music is awesome.  I was born in 85.  Music sucks today.  It is so digital.  Everything sounds like everything else.  But man, back in the 80s, music was fantastic.  I will have to get the soundtrack, actually and the Blu-ray of this.

If you like British movies, great music and just good movies overall, then you have to check this one out.  I am so glad I checked on the net.  I had never even heard of this and probably would not have, if not for the fact that I checked.",1492387200,,1916,3.931758530183727
7730772,5,B01E698FFC,I loved this sweet little movie.  There's a definite fantasy element to this narrative of a teenager's rather bleek though not tragic life and the awakening of hope that follows from the attempt to form a high school rock band and compose songs.

7730774,5,B01E698FFC,"This is one of the best ""feel good"" movies I have ever seen! It reminds me of a boy I mentored back in the 80's. This boy was basically ignored by his parents and was harassed in high school and I helped him, for about 5 years, thru part of his teenaged years which as we all know can be very difficult! His needs were simple all he needed was a buddy to hang out with and not put him down. I taught him how to water and snow ski and work out and stick up for himself and when he later moved to Arizona and later Alaska I felt like I lost my own son. He was the kid I never had. It's amazing how well he turned out with all of that adversity, he still turned out to be a winner. Some kids just rise above all of the terrible things that happen to them at an early age. He is now a successful hotel owner with a beautiful wife and daughter and I was proud to be a part of his life. It doesn't take much imagination to figure out who in this film my friend reminds me of. Oh yes I'll be 75 in June.",1490486400,,996,3.770334928229665

7730782,5,B01E698FFC,"This is a nice school kid character based simple low budget Irish film, didn't recognise any of the actors except for the dad (Aidan Gillen) who is in Game of Thrones, but he's pretty must just a cameo appearance.  These little known actors playing teenagers do a pretty good job though, Lucy Boynton as Raphina, a mysterious girl who stands on the steps of a house across the road from a school, the object of a young man's desires, who tells she's a model and might star in his music video film clip.  Of course the problem for Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) is that he can't even play an instrument, let alone is in a band.  But that's not going to stop him forming one with other social losers from his new catholic school.

The movie is a bit far fetched as movies often are, kids seem to master instruments pretty quickly, and the quality of the songs is a lot better than it would obviously be. But then again perhaps it's all a fantasy rose coloured glasses type look through the delusions of a guy trying to get the girl, and in reality the band were terrible, but if that's the case the other characters should have reacted a bit differently.  I would also say the band, especially towards the latter songs and the gym performance looked more musicians from the first half of the 90's, such as Greenday (not sound like) than an 80's band.  Also as someone who went to school (granted not in Ireland but in the 80's), I don't think any male would have lasted long wearing female makeup and carrying around a handbag. On stage and performing in the band for film clips maybe, but it wouldn't have just been the sadistic priest headmaster that would have been violent towards him at school.  It obviously wasn't right, but that's how it was.

But saying all that, Sing Street is a really fun film. It's an unpopular guy trying to get the in his eyes popular girl, sort movie more than anything else. The music was other than the first song, pretty good, nothing that would have likely been a hit back in the 80's, but there were plenty of worse songs than this that were plugged on the radio and hung around for a few weeks to be forgotten forever afterwards, that these ""fake"" songs were a lot better than.",1487894400,,2210,4.439506172839506

7730844,4,B01E698FFC,"We watched Sing Street after reading about it in EW which listed it as among the years most underrated movies.  We feel like under-rated people, so them under-rated movies should suit us right down to the ground.  Indeed we did enjoy Sing Street, though it wasn't our favorite movie of all time unlike many of the other reviews here on Amazon.  I saw how Aiden Gillen was in it, living in the same house as this cute 15 year old boy, and based on what I remember from the old Queer as Folk show, you put him nearby a 15 year old and that boy will be biting the pillows next!  That didn't happen and it soon became clear that Aiden Gillen is playing the father to the two teens and one sort of 22 year old (looks thirty two), all of whom despise him for playing the cuckold to their mother.  Ireland in 1985 was in really bad shape, almost as bad as today, and you get the idea early on in Sing Street that the go getters among the young people were emigrating as fast as they could get out.

Young Conor, the cute 15 year old, is punished by Aiden Gillen and sent to the Catholic boys school!  We were wondering if Ireland is that backwards that public school costs more than the private Catholic school?  Seems like it, and the other pupils are all scum, led by a tyrannical bully who forces Conor to give him a Mars Bar and orders him to dance without his pants on.  Young Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, who plays the frightened new lad, does a fine job with gaining courage and initiative and before long, he has the bully playing the game as he wants him to.  Theres a mean Christian Brother who persecutes him solely because hes so pretty and also hes supposed to be wearing black shoes, which hes not.  I get the ideas that this Brother is more interested in young Ferdia in that old Aiden Gillen way.  He does look more like a leading man as the movie goes on, Conor meets a girl, encouraging him to start a band, and before you know it, hes playing the guitar like hes Jeff Beck or something.  They see an act on MTV and every time they go for broke and want to become the new Duran Durana band of the futurea futurist band, Conor brags.  They make videos and attract attention and most of all, they gain self-confidence, the boys Conor beings together.  This is a movie for everyone whos ever felt like a loser.  Youll feel better after watching this.

Except for the very end, in which Conor betrays everyone whos been good to him.  I won't spoil how it turns out but our hero, instead of letting the band be his ticket to fame, opts for another solution that I just didn't buy.  That ending makes a feel good picture into a picture that rewards self-gratification and punishes the undercommons.  The picture has some catchy songs, as did Once and Begin Again, other films by the writer director John Carney.  Yet this ones markedly inferior to those two.",1483488000,,2854,4.337099811676083

7730880,5,B01E698FFC,"I went to see this virtually the day it came out. It was a very depressing time for me, and I figured this would cheer me up. I LOVED it, have since bought it and watch it all the time when I need a pick-me-up or just because it's any given day of the week. Every one of the characters is wonderful, even those who aren't fully fleshed-out, they're all real. And the performances are phenomenal, I don't know how Carney did it with this young cast (with the exception of Jack Reynor, comparatively experienced, also phenomenal). And did I mention the music? Hilarious, wonderful, stays with you long after you've left the theater (""Drive it like you stole it,"" words to live by). ""Sing Street"" uses every trope in this old chestnut of a plot and nails it. It will be hard for any director down the road who's thinking along the same lines to come up with anything that comes remotely near -- with the possible exception of Carney himself.

Also, It needs a sequel.
Not that there was a gigantic cliffhanger or anything, I just so badly want to see their life after this one.

The story will be familiar to anyone whos watched teen comedies  outcast Dublin kid starts a band to win the attention of a cute girl  but the characters are so personable, the dialogue so amusing, and the tone so good-natured that any lack of originality is forgiven.

It's 1985 Dublin, Ireland and young teen Conor Lawlor (later, ""Cosmo"") is just waking up to love, music, identity, dreams, and his place in the world.  His parents are a mess and he's just been transferred to a lower-end new school where he's being bullied and abused.  But love is in the air when an older girl (and model) claims his heart and inspires him to make music to impress her.  These are the days of music video and the new wave of music... Conor makes up his mind to create a band and a music video that his new crush will star in.

So a group of young nerdy boys come together and they make it happen.  At home, Conor's seemingly do-nothing pothead older brother acts as a musical mentor... being in touch as he is with the whole new musical movement.  Loved their relationship, lol.

Very engaging movie!!  The clothes, the hair, boys in make up, and, of course, the 80's music... it's all here to some degree.  As well as the teen romance and kooky 80's identity experimentation.  Amusing watching Conor move from Duran Duran to The Cure and to Spandau Ballet in his appearance, lol.  What surprised me most is that their music actually improved and they got pretty good!  However, they did seem to be ripping off some popular bands, lol.

There was a bit of a dreamy, fantasy element to it all.  I don't want to say implausible, though.  Because I think it says something about the 80's.  The film captured something about the changing times and adolescence and following your dreams and that gave it a magical, inspiring appeal.

The best part of the movie for me is Conor's relationship with his older brother. I love what they did for each other.  The thing I was most disappointed in was the lack of 80's music, however... there could have been so much more.  Even so, there's a nice bit of 1980's nostalgia here to enjoy... no matter where you're from.",1479168000,,1884,4.501474926253687

7730963,3,B01E698FFC,"""Sing Street"" is a noble venture that in my eyes falls short of its lofty ambitions.  Director John Carney effectively evokes mid-eighties Dublin and is appropriately attuned to the teen ethos.  What nearly sinks the project is a lame song score.  For starters the MOR pabulum Carney concocted does not suggest the period.  It's more like easy listening adult contemporary than the pop that was all the rage at the time.  In no way does it suggest the influence of Duran Duran, the Cure, or Depeche Mode.  Some may say this is quibbling but for a film that bills itself as a musical this is a relevant criticism.  As demonstrated in his previous film ""Begin Again"" Carney knows the business side of music inside and out but can't craft a memorable song if his life depended on it.  He should leave songwriting to the pros and stick to the other side of the camera.",1475193600,,864,4.564935064935065

7730981,5,B01E698FFC,"As one can read from the reviews here, SING STREET is a thoroughly enjoyable, ""feel-good"" film.  Anyone who remembers the MTV-fueled 80s ""modern music"" scene will find plenty of nostalgia here.  The new music is interspersed with 80s standards, and holds up completely...""Drive It Like You Stole It"" should be smash hit in any rational universe. On one level, it's a wonderful throwback to 80s films.

But there's more to this movie than that...a fact that reveals itself more and more on repeated viewings.  First of all, every character has a dark reality, that is only hinted at in the various scenes.  Paying attention to the dialogue will reveal some subtle, startling insights.

More importantly, this film blurs the line between fantasy and reality in the character's lives.  It's obvious in the ""Drive It"" performance, but it's there throughout.  How much is really happening, versus what the characters are imagining?  I was actually reminded of Terry Gilliam's work in that respect.

Without giving anything away, let me just ask:  Did the ending (about which many have commented here) really happen the way we see it?  There's a foreshadowing of the ending during the first few minutes of the film, that suggests that the outcome was altogether not what we think it is.

If none of this make any sense (and it might not since I am determined not to give away any spoilers) the movie is completely delightful on its basic level.  That's one of the great things about it, and i loved it.  But there's more lurking under the surface that will justify repeated viewings...",1474416000,10,1579,4.883458646616542

7731009,5,B01E698FFC,"From Once writer/director John Carney comes secret reboot Sing Street. He sure knows how to write and direct movies about motley outcasts starting bands in Ireland.

On the one hand this movie bottles (at the source) a perfect cocktail of uniquely, or nearly uniquely, teenage feelings. The belief not just in the possible but in the inevitable, in the  dare I say it   destined.

On the other hand, I do have to dare to say it, because the successes of this movie highlight the distance I have traveled, drifted rather, from a place where destiny, where getting the girl through the power of music, where love can cross all boundaries, or at least the Irish Sea, where losers can become kings, seemed possible, let alone destined. And again that is based on this films success. I imagine the cynics, if not converted, will have a harder time buying into the cheesiness of this movie than the rest of us. And I don't bunch myself in with the rest of the cynics there, because I do bunch myself in with the converted.

This movie might be tropey, it might check all of the boxes that you would expect, but in doing so manages a few good left jabs with some of the most compelling and believable characters on screen in recent memory, (You cant watch Paper Towns or The Spectacular Now without wondering whether or not Hollywood knows what kids are anymore) with awkward moments, and anger, and sadness, in perfect measures, and moments, the sort that we can believe in because weve had them before. And then a good clean right hook of an original soundtrack to follow that up.

Some of the best moments in the movie are when characters don't understand what the hell other characters are talking about. Someone says something profound in The Fault in our Stars and everyone just goes wow, or worse, acts like thats the way everyone talks all the time. Someone says something a bit complicated in Sing Street and characters argue about what it means, or call it stupid, or pretentious. It pulls you in like that. Ive been there. This was me. I had no idea what I wanted. But I wanted it anyway. I had no idea where I was going. And yet I went.",1473465600,6,2141,4.5310880829015545
7731010,5,B01E698FFC,"I won't go into a full plot synopsis since there is already a lot of that here. I will say that Sing Street is probably my favorite movie and soundtrack. Ever. The story of the awkward kid who forms a band to impress a beautiful, complicated, aloof girl is told well with a combo of humor and sadness. (""happy-sad!""). The acting is incredible, from Ferdia Walsh-Peelo's moments of desolation and longing, to a flash of anger in his eyes as Raphina complains about being stuck hanging around a ""15 year old schoolboy."" Mark McKenna also does a fine job of providing some low-key humor in the form of some subtle facial expressions and a flat affect at just the right moment. The Riddle of the Model scene where McKenna/""Eamon"" knocks over the cymbal during the shoot is hysterical. The rest of the cast, from the other lads in the band, to the more experienced actors such as Lucy Boynton and Jack Reynor are all superb. Reynor's character, older brother Brendan, has some of the most profound dialogue in the movie, and he expresses it so naturally.

I grew up in the 80s and am about the same age as director John Carney. He nailed all of the little details, from wardrobe to the style of the video the Sing Street guys shoot. Every time I watch this movie I see something else funny; Carney has some nice little sight gags in addition to the most-mentioned one where the band's clothes and look change according to what Pop band they are into at the moment.  For example, pay attention to the ribbons and photos on Eamon's living room wall. Carney has crafted some brilliant scenes that incorporate the progress of the band, notably the writing of ""Up"" sequence.

The soundtrack is amazing, with some great hits from some of my favorites such as Duran Duran and The Cure. But the best songs are actually the original soundtrack songs, which stand up well next to the real 80s tunes.

I have high hopes this movie will receive some Oscar recognition, at least for the original songs, if not for the acting.",1473379200,,2007,4.582172701949861
7731011,5,B01E698FFC,"This is the best film I've seen in my life I think. I cannot think of any other movie that made me so much made my heart beat and stimulated my desire of art and life of becoming something to acheive, love, art and my work everything in life.
After watching this movie it was 12 am and I was afraid that I might not be able to go to sleep. But luckily I was able too.

How can I start!

The music that they created, the original songs are so well made that I was not able to breath.
The story is something that we all have been go through in our chilhood life.
A boy falls in love with a girl. He can do anything to acheive her. He even makes this band to prove that he can sing because she is a model- wanna be model- and the only way to approach her is to be a singer and work with her as make her a model in their music video model at that time.

Just like the Japanese movie SHALL WE DANCE, it started with him taking dance lesson to approach to the daning teacher.
This movie, he started to sing to approach to this one year older then him girl.
Then he discovers that how much he loves music and how much talented he is singing and composing.

Man, what a Ride!!!

The movie just get better and better that I really couldn't breath.
By the end of the movie, I was almost about to choke to death.

When finally the band is having a concert at school and there is this one retro 50s song playing with dream like sequence is on the screen with 50 style american people are dancing with their song, it was just pure fantasy, a dream that everyone wanted to be.
If you have seen CARRIE the movie where there is a Junior prom sequence is on, you might have more idea what I'm talking about.

But the song is not a slow one it was more of a hillarious dance song with so much telxture beyond it. Because the girl didn't appeared at the moment and this song is actually for her.

This is a love song to every girls.
This is a love song for who helped the boy out who is his brother.
This is all the lover out there who is seeking to expose their ability to the world. Not fame they wanted to show. The star is not they wanted to be. It is their desire to be a well known artist.

IF you wanted to be opened your heart, mind and soul this is your man.
If you want to stay in wonderland not knowing where your going to, be there and rot.",1473379200,3,2333,3.9468085106382977

In a way this film reminds me of another music-centric movie, ""The Commitments"" as they're both about musicians following their dream, no matter what kind of obstacles are placed in their way.  The fact that both ""The Commitments"" and ""Sing Street"" are both set in Ireland is probably no coincidence considering the rich tradition of song and pain running through that country.",1472515200,,515,4.976744186046512

7731076,5,B01E698FFC,"Dreams, unrealized dreams, dreams not fulfilled, regrets we have a few. Most of us over the age of 50 can relate. But,in Sing Street, we see dreams that can be realized and that can come alive.

It is 1985 and many Dubliners are racing to London to find jobs. We meet an Irish family, difficulty paying their bills, mom and dad arguing a lot, and the three kids trying to figure out what lies ahead. The middle boy, Conor is taken out of his public school to go to the free Christian school run by Brothers. Conor meets bullies in the Brothers and the students. A young red headed kid takes pity and tells him he needs to man up so to speak.  Conor, played by Ferdia Walsh- Peelo, is one of those young men with such a talent, I wondered where has he been? He is the film and his talent shines through. Conor sees a gorgeous young woman on a front step, named Raphina, played by Lucy Boynton, and tells her he wants to film her in his band. The problem is he has no band, and that is the storyline of the film.

Conor's older brother, Brendan, played by Jack Reynor, has lost his dreams in weed, but he knows music and becomes Conor's guide. I am rooting for Brendan, Conor may be finding his way, and now it is time for Brendan.

This film is filled with music and fun. The band exists and will they find their way? That is what dreams are made of. For Brothers Everywhere.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-28-16",1472342400,4,1412,4.273408239700374

Connor is being taught by The Jesuits in Dublin but his father 0- Aiden Gillen  is having financial problems and so needs to make some cutbacks. The first victim is Connor who gets sent to the rather dilapidated Synge Street school run by The Christian Brothers  he is not best pleased.

On arrival he enters a world of strident teachers, bullies and a strange show policy. He also meets Raphina  and is immediately smitten. She is an aspiring model and so he decides to get her to be in his bands pop video. Problem number one is he does not have a band  so he sets about pulling one together.

This is a wonderful film from start to finish, the actors are all perfect in their roles and the writing and direction for John Carney (Begin Again and Once) are superb.

I hesitated for a few weeks because the previews looked like it was trying too hard to look like an 80's period piece but as it turned out they were spot on.  This movie was able to bring back the feeling of angst suffered by all of us when going through the stage of life portrayed in this film.  The music scenes are realistic; if the kids can't play for real, they were definitely coached well to make it look as if they knew their way around an instrument.  The characters were believable and likeable and the music was straight from the 80's.

I can officially say that it's one of--if not my top--favorite coming of age movies. The young, and unknown--I'm assuming--cast is phenomenal in this movie, outshining their older supporting players by far. I missed it in theaters, so I highly anticipated the blu-ray release, and was surprised that it lived up to the hype! Plot was good, with a genuine coming of age story and light-hearted humor. All of the characters rang true to themselves. And the music didn't disappoint. Probably going to buy the soundtrack next. If you're up for a good story with a lot of heart, check it out.

That should be enough to let you enjoy your first viewing.
It's just a fun, funny, feel-good movie with fun music from the 80s. There are some dramatic parts that give you the feels, and some deep stuff if you pay attention - enough to make this a great movie, and not just fluff. It's about young love, and finding yourself, and making music, and friends and family relationships.
The Weinstein Brothers picked it up as executive producers, so let's hope that we'll see it during awards season. Those guys know good films that win prizes. Made by John Carney, who also made Once and Begin Again, two other great films about making music. But this one is his best.

At first glance the older brother seems unambitious and on a treadmill in his life. But he ends up speaking to his younger brother through song, and ends up being able to create something for his brother and girlfriend to take with them on their spontaneous escape to London. The characters are likeable and the story has plenty of layering in its musical evolution of the band, as well as the breadth of boys playing these parts. You root for them because you want them to ""make it"". It's every young kid's story of struggling with bullies, the awkwardness of home life and the pressures of school while dealing with puberty.

I was expecting something along the lines of a mixture of ""The Commitments"" and maybe ""School of Rock"". While there are some similarities at times to those two movies, Sing Street is something more.

Overall, I have to say I enjoyed the movie - but I will also say I watched short segments of it over the course of several days. The beginning of the film was a bit harsh in my opinion. Being an ex-teacher I actually cringed a bit seeing the state of the school Conor is transferred to. Yeah, I know it was a different time back then and a different country (as pointed out in a note at the end of the film credits), but it was hard to watch.

If I were to have any criticism of the film, it would be that the story was filled with many of the typical clichs for a teen film like this. Teen angst, first crush, bullying, family conflict, pushing social boundaries, a dream/fantasy dance sequence, and teen rebellion against authority. Watching the film it was almost like having a mental checklist where you could check off each as they showed up in the film. Which isn't a bad thing, just that it each was a bit too obvious. The kids in the film were great.

The Blu-ray disc was fine - there are some extras to watch. I liked seeing the bits of the auditions for the kid actors, it gave you a bit of a look at how some of the dialogue was changed from then to what was in the film. The blu-ray came with a digital download, but I didn't make use of that.",1471219200,,1593,4.182410423452769

-------

Sing Street is definitely a period piece of the early/mid-80s.  Occasionally, you're not sure if you are in 1982 or 1985, but brushing the occasional minor timeline plot issues aside, it's a movie that strikes a tone and sticks to it consistently.

We follow Conor, a youth who has recently been placed in a rough Catholic school because his parents have fallen on hard times (which, in 1980s Dublin Ireland, isn't hard to imagine).  He gets occasionally bullied and also called out by the Catholic headmaster for the rather strict rules regarding the wearing of black shoes only (Conor's shoes are brown and his parents can't afford another pair).

Fate brings Conor across the path of Raphina, a girl who seems older, and is a model...?  Who knows?  There's a little mystery around her at the beginning and Conor tries to chat her up as a romantic interest and he blurts out that he's starting a band.  With another misfit in tow, what follows is an occasionally humorous but beautiful journey as Conor finds other misfits who can actually play instruments.

And they're awful.

At first.

Their first attempt at covering ""Rio"" by Duran Duran will have you laughing a little bit, although it comes across as sounding like young teens earnestly attempting to strike musical gold.  However, Conor's musical muses in Raphina and his older brother eventually steer the band in directions that sound average, then good, then remarkable.  The journey itself is half the fun and the other half are the original songs which were co-penned by the writer/director of the film.  The songs are actually quite good and borrow from diverse influences of Duran Duran, The Cure, Spandau Ballet, Hall & Oates, etc.

I don't want to spoil it any further nor rob you of Conor's maturing, strife, and co-writing sessions with his friend Eamon.  If what I've written so far is enough to convince you to see it, I know that you'll love it.

That said, the film occasionally does hit the odd flat note.  The rebellion against the school, for one, seems a tad off given that this seemed more like a sideshow compared to the main romance that permeates throughout the film.  It's not that it doesn't work, but it does seem that something went awry in the editing room and I think an overzealous editor may have trimmed a few minutes too much.  But then again, it's hard to tell...without having the benefit of seeing what did and didn't get into the film, it's hard to know if this film could have gone from great to beyond exceptional.

But it's still a good ride.

And it's worth taking.",1470960000,,2581,4.727069351230425

The main character has a struggling family life and is searching for some acceptance in the world. He finds it in Raphina, a beautiful teenager who he convinces to star in his music videos. But the problem is he doesn't actually have a band.

7731151,5,B01E698FFC,"The film is set in Dublin during the mid-eighties.
'Conor's' (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) family fall on hard times, his father 'Robert' (Aidan Gillen) unable to find work in his field,
his mother 'Penny' (Maria Doyle Kennedy) is on a 3-day week, sadly this means that they can no longer afford the private
schooling for 'Conor'
He is sent to Synge Street Catholic School a State-Free establishment which will prove quite a culture shock for the 15 year
old, adapting and fitting in would be a challenge.
Early on he is bullied but does find the one friend, opposite the school gate 'Conor' catches site of a pretty 16 year-old girl
'Raphina' (Lucy Boynton) seemingly posing on the steps of her home with an unlit cigarette in her mouth....'Conor' plucks
up the courage to approach her offering her a part in his Bands video shoots.....trouble is, he has no Band.
She tells 'Conor' that she will be going to the mainland (England) soon to pursue a modelling career though does seem a
bit interested in his proposition.
Well, 'Conor' realises to impress 'Raphina' he really will have to come up with a Band....with help he is introduced firstly to
'Eamon' (Mark McKenna) who owns and is able to play several instruments....an inspired introduction as he will help 'Conor'
write songs (many of which will be written with 'Raphina' in mind)
Bit by bit they put a Band together though with very diverse characters, early on they will follow the style of the day but
will over a period of time find an identity and style all of their own, they come up with the name 'Sing Street' for the Band.
'Conor' will use the stage-name 'Cosmo' for himself......practiced-up it is now time to ask 'Raphina' to be a part of the video
-shoot.
Obviously 'Conor' has romantic intentions toward the pretty 'Raphina' however it seems at first her interest in that department
lies elsewhere.....
A sometimes troubled time for 'Conor' and sometimes Joyous ahead.
A pleasant film i myself almost overlooked however i spotted one or two positive vibes from reviewers / critics so gave it a go.
With the backdrop of clips of stars oft he day on TV footage creating the mood of the film it really does, after a slow start become
a very uplifting movie experience overall with many foot-tapping numbers performed by 'Sing Street' along the way....give it a go
you'll almost certainly enjoy...

7731178,3,B01E698FFC,"It's good, but you'd have to be a diehard fan of teen romance movies -- or writer-director John Carney's previous film ""Once"" -- to call it a great one. Basically it's a mix of Once and The Commitments, but far closer in spirit and sentimentality to the former than the latter. It starts with a potentially fun premise: an Irish lad in mid-80s Dublin starts a band to impress a pretty girl. But things go awry pretty soon. For one thing, it defies all logic and reality that a bunch of 14-year-olds who start a band are instantly writing perfect pop songs and playing them expertly. Not even the Beatles pulled that off, as anyone who was ever in a high school band knows. Carney keeps the teen romance sentimentality and the nearly-a-musical fantasy elements coming thru the rest of the movie, and as much as I wanted to like it -- and as much as I admired the two young actors who are the central romance -- it all just went way too far into ""Once"" date-movie territory for me -- and my date thought so too. SPOILER: In the end, when the two young lovers go sailing across the Irish Sea in the tiniest of open boats, we both threw up our hands and shook our heads.",1470528000,,1166,4.328767123287672

On a whim Conor speaks to a young girl, Raphina, that spawns the inspiration for forming a band.  This band is the outlet Conor needs to express his love to Raphina, his school frustrations & his home life angst.  What we get a combination of witty dialog, a heartfelt storyline & some amazing 80's-esque original music.  The story never seems forced or simply taking the Hollywood cliche way out.

Having grown up in the 1980s, the musical style of the band that the young boys form in the movie is like taking a trip down memory lane. The film pays homage to great groups like Duran Duran and it authentically captures the literal ""new wave"" of music that encircled the globe. My favorite song was probably ""Drive like you stole it"" (I think that's what it's called) and the fantasy school prom scene when the band plays that song is brilliant. This is definitely worth watching.",1469404800,,587,4.444444444444445
7731212,4,B01E698FFC,"An enjoyable film, set in 1985, about music, muses and the kind of madness, internal and external, that descends on many of us in our teen years. Conor is a 15-year-old compelled by family circumstances to start attending a pretty grisly Catholic-run school called Synge Street. (The school actually exists, and one has to admire the willingness to let it be depicted as it is here, albeit as it may have been 30 years ago.) Every bully in the school seems to get a radar fix on him at the outset, especially Brother Baxter, head of the school, who refuses to cut Conor even the tiniest bit of slack when it comes to school rules. That a spirit of resistance dwells within Conor soon becomes evident when he see a girl, Raphina, standing aimlessly on the stoop of her house and decides, against warnings, to approach her. The encounter is not a disaster, except that Conor tells her he's in a band and they're making a video and he'd like her to be in it. She agrees, and this kicks things into high gear; Conor must now form a band and set up an actual video shoot, which he does with the aid of certain friends he proceeds to miraculously make.

One friend, Eamon, is a multi-instrumentalist with an impressive collection of instruments, from drum kits to pan pipes, and he and Conor form a writing partnership that I suspect reflects the filmmakers' notions of the early days of Lennon-McCartney. This is where things go a little agly, as the romance between Conor and Raphina, pleasant as it is, just isn't as interesting as the band itself. Raphina, in fact, becomes superfluous once she fires up Conor's creativity and he and Eamon develop their collaboration. More, it's Conor's older brother Brendan who puts him in touch with the musical inspirations and familial support he really needs.

7731218,4,B01E698FFC,"Sing Street is an infectious, and enjoyable movie.

The movie is a coming-of-age period piece, in this case the 1980s in Ireland.  As a child of the 80s it was fun to look back at the fashions, decor, and technology of the time.  The music, however, takes center stage.  There are lots of great old songs interspersed throughout the movie, but the real stars were the original songs written for the film.  They are very period appropriate and while most are upbeat, there is one slow song that is quite beautiful.  The story is well developed and enjoyable.  It has some minor surprises, but mostly works out as you would expect a coming-of-age story to.

The cast of characters are fairly typical for a coming-of-age film.  The main antagonist, Conor, is intelligent and soft-spoken, but also surprisingly defiant and brazen.  His band mates are a motley crew, and while they don't get much character development they do feel organic and are enjoyable to watch.  The girl, Raphnia, is independent and brazen, but also scared and scarred.  You get to meet Conor's family as well.  The parents aren't the best, and are more concerned with themselves than the children.  There's also a sister, with a very small part.  It's the older, brother, however who is Conor's biggest influence, and despite not making much of his life, hero.

The actors all do a phenomenal job and you can really feel the chemistry between them.  The interactions between Conor and his brother, and Conor and Raphina are particularly noteworthy.  Moreover, Raphina is a scene-stealer and all eyes are on her charismatic personality whenever she is on screen.

The technical quality of the Blu-ray was fine.  I had no issues with sound or picture on my 1080p 50"" plasma.  Extras, however, are minimal.

All in all... fun to watch and listen to.",1469059200,,1816,4.827922077922078

7731220,4,B01E698FFC,"My daughter is a huge fan of the film Once, enough so that she'd picked up Begin Again but unfortunately had remained a bit too busy to be able to sit and watch that one so far.  Knowing what a fan she was of Once, this film was an easy thing to request a chance to review.  Few things in life give me more pleasure than being able to hopefully put, even if for an instant, a smile on my daughter's face (or on her brother's) and the thought she'd get a chance at a sneak peak at the Blu-ray release of this film was one of those chances that I just couldn't pass up.

The word from my daughter is that I done good.  While she found this film, like Once before it, a bit predictable, she also found it quite enjoyable.  Not perfect, but certainly a 4/5 star film.  She noted that she enjoyed the casting and appreciated that this film included several new faces, giving her a chance to perhaps find some new favorite actresses and actors.  After watching the film the word was that the cast did a good job with a relatively well written story that was very enjoyable.  As expected, if you liked the film Once, you will probably be someone that will enjoy this film as well.

As with the film Once, the music that is embedded in this film expands upon the story without taking over the film.  It is an important element, but then so too are the relationships that both films are really about.  In Sing Street, the characters come together through a band that hasn't yet been formed, and so begins an nice and enjoyable diversion for about an hour and 45 minutes worth of your viewing time.  Music that may remind viewers that can remember it of the new wave music of the 80's (the period this film is set in) help to give this film just a bit more heart and reason to keep hoping that its star will live his dream.",1468886400,,1813,4.223188405797101

When Conor starts at a new school and falls in love with the girl who lives across the road who is way out of his league, the only logical conclusion is to start a band and make a music video for her to star in.

What did I think?

Remember when you were a teenager and you were made of daydreams and maybe-somedays? Sing Street is what wouldve happened if all of that miraculously worked out all set to rad 80s music.

7731222,5,B01E698FFC,"On the face of it, director John Carney (Once, Begin Again) might seem like a bit of a one-trick pony. After all, his three best-known films all center on music (independent singer-songwriters), Ireland, or both but a bare-bones description of his work doesnt do it justice. In Sing Street, as he did in Once and Begin Again, he brings heart, joy, and a grasp of the authentic joy of the love of music to his films.

Sing Street is set in mid-1980s Dublin, Ireland. 15-year-old Conor Lawlor is transferred to a new school when hard economic times mean his parents can no longer afford his private school. In order to cope with a rougher environment  and to impress a mysterious girl who lives in a joint home in the neighborhood  Conor turns to music. He invites the girl, Raphina, to be in a music video for his band  and must then form a band to back up the invitation. Finding a motley crew of like-minded boys to join him, he draws on inspiration provided by the top musical acts of the day  A-Ha!, Duran Duran, The Cure, and other now-iconic 80s pop groups  to inform the musical sensibilities of his group, named Sing Street as a play on the name of his new school, Synge Street Christian Brothers School. Conors older brother, 20-year-old Brendan, a dope-smoking college dropout who is nevertheless a compassionate advocate of his younger brother, is a key player in Conors musical education, and provides a steadying, supportive backup for his younger brothers musical journey.

The movie is very authentic in its use of the music of the period, and deals honestly, and kindly, with young love, teenage angst, and the confusion and uncertainty of young people coping with their parents trials (not only economic but personal, as Conors parents marriage is in a rocky state.) Through the band Conor grows both emotionally and musically, finding the courage to face down not only the inevitable school bullies but also the precarious state of his unsteady family life. It is a sweet, funny, kindly story with a hopeful message and a great soundtrack of period and original music.

(Interesting note: Conors mother, Penny Lawlor, is played by Marie Doyle-Kennedy, who appeared in the 1991 film The Commitments, about a fictional flash-in-the-pan Irish R&B/soul group  another great Irish film about music.)",1468713600,,2311,4.875

Writer/Director John Carey does a masterful job crafting Dublin in the 1980s and the subtly nuanced characters with their trials and tribulations that inhabit it.  if you remember and enjoyed the wave of teen films like PRETTY IN PINK and SIXTEEN CANDLES in the 80s, I am reasonably confident SING STREET, in all of its charming, awkward sweetness, will be your newest favorite teen flick.",1468022400,,817,4.863309352517986

7731233,5,B01E698FFC,"I watched this delightful film all the way through to the end non-stop despite the fact that it is a long haul at 2 1/2 hours. I totally love the eighties. The acting and soundtrack (which is a mix of old and new songs) are both stellar.
The story is set in Dublin, where a younger son is forced to begin attending Catholic school when the family lands on hard(er) times. The older brother is a stoner and has already dropped out of college. Despite this, the viewer will find some true amusement in his advice to his younger brother, the main character in ""Sing Street"". Various relationships are explored, including the difficult one between the parents (the dad is played by Aiden Gillen). The sister in the family only appears in a few scenes.

Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), the younger brother, is swept off his feet by the sight of the glamorous Raphina (Lucy Boynton). He decides to start a band and make a video starring her in order to impress her. This part is a bit slow however rings true.

The ups and downs of the movie can be very entertaining, especially when the older brother makes observations and commentaries concerning his younger brother's doings. For example, his admonishments about never starting a cover band totally cracked me up. ""No covers!"" ""Rock and Roll is a RISK!""
Conor finds his niche when he creates a music style called ""Futurist"".Possibly the screenwriters were giving a nod to ""Back to Future:, which is mentioned in this film.
There is plenty of enjoyment in this movie, and it will engage you if you love music and young romance. It is very sweet and quite funny.
As I spend a lot of time searching out good music, I appreciated a movie which focuses on music. Loved the song by The Cure which appeared in there around halfway through the film.
""Sing Street"" (which is the name of Conor's band) has a lot to love about it, as you watch Conor slowly put his life back together after his parents destroy it in the beginning, and begin to fulfill his dreams.",1468022400,,1995,4.5854341736694675
7731234,5,B01E698FFC,"This Irish import works on so many universal levels.  First it is the quintessential coming of age story set in Dublin, Ireland during the depression of the 80's which had such a devastating effect on the middle class and in particular the young people of Ireland that lasts up to this very day.  A 14 year old aspiring songwriter musician named Conor is torn from his already teetering life of disharmony at home because of both parental discord and lack of family finances and sent from his private Jesuit school to an inner city Catholic School and set on a path that will forever change his views of the world, of family, and of his fellow students.

He is thrown for such a loop that it would appear that he'll never recover, but one fine day after being bullied in the bathroom by a fellow misfit and  then put upon by the headmaster for not wearing black shoes (school requirement) when he has none and can afford none, he sees a beautiful girl just standing on a landing across from the school and asks his only new found friend, a boy who shares his put upon world, who she is and is told, ""Oh, that's Raphina"" and he begins to change his life in ways he only imagines it should be.  Funny thing is...this movie is about how you can do that.  You can make what you want happen if you have it within you to do so and from here on out that journey to escaping his present and molding his future is set in motion.  He approaches her (never knowing she's his muse) with his false bravado (bear in mind he's fourteen and she's an older girl - by one year) and is told she's a model and she's going to London one day.  He invites her to do a video for his band and she says she's interested.  This encounter sets up the rest of the movie and brings into play the other universal theme - the power of music to lift and express and mold and define - because now he has to form a band before 'Saturday Next'.

He and his friend begin to recruit musicians from their fellow misfits and right off the bat he finds his musical soulmate in Eamon, a rabbit loving teen who's Dad's in a cover band, and from whom Eamon has learned to play just about any instrument in the world as he proceeds to demonstrate (this is a great scene in the movie which is filled with scenes of equal power).  This serendipitous encounter and the recruiting of the remaining three members gives us a band equipped to begin their growth (Eamon's dad is in rehab and the rehearsal instruments are just sitting there - unused).  The rest of the story centers on the growing crush that Conor has on the girl and the formation and development of the band.  I don't want to give the whole story away here because the director has taken these two universal themes of 'coming of age' and the 'power of music' and fashioned  a movie that brings you the delicate balances of love and loss and how music can play a part in defining any generation by expressing those personal emotions on a scale that encompasses a peer group and by extension all of us.

Meanwhile Conor is beginning to see his family, especially his older brother who immediately reacts to his interest in forming the band with positive support and an unerring eye for which direction his brother should head, in the light of developing maturity.  His parents are breaking up, his brother is regretting not doing what Conor is doing when he had the chance and all these influences begin to churn in Conor's head and from there into songs of rare power and expression.

That brings us to the other component of the movie besides the spot on performances of its juvenile leads and the laser focus of the actors playing the parents living lives of disappointment and crushing defeat and yet you see moments having had their own dreams and the brother (hardest act in the movie)  who sees both sides (parents and Conor) and is finally waking up to his own predicament pretty clearly and that's the music.

Conor and Eamon are the Lennon and McCartney of their generation in Dublin, Ireland and they write songs that are both brilliant rock and roll and also very intimate expressions of Conor's up and down relationship with Raphina (Lucy Boynton) and also the world around them.  Eamon bringing the music and Conor the lyrics in complete harmony.  'The Riddle Of The Model' perfectly captures what Conor sees or thinks he sees in Raphina and how hard it is for him to figure out what's real and what's not.  'Drive It Like You Stole It' has that driving beat that says what new found teen confidence means in the band's lives.  'Brown Shoes' is the final act of rebellion when the boys have come into their own and see themselves whole and understand what effect the adults around them have had and that the bullying of the Headmaster is just that and it's time to throw it in his face (literally).  There are other Sing Street (the band's name) songs as well and they speak for themselves when you hear them.  Additionally the songs of the era via Duran Duran, Aha, Genesis etc., figure prominently in the band's development.

'Go Now' though not written by the boys and sung by Adam Levine (one should note that the fine young Irish actor Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, playing Conor, actually sings the songs the boys write in the movie which goes a long long way toward making the movie magic work) is the liberating song that gives the actual message of the movie.  Raphina makes it to London and fails and comes back emotionally beaten and distances herself from Conor and Conor sees that his and Eamon's songs are worth something and is determined to go to London, hopefully with Raphina if they can mend the gulf between them now and make something of himself and his band.

The movie culminates in the band's first live performance, an end of term dance at the school, that I won't spoil for you and the immediate aftermath of the gig.

If the young actors that appear in this movie are an indication of the level of talent in Ireland today then the rest of the world had best watch out!  I'm not familiar enough with their names or work to speak of them individually, but everybody in this film does fine work they can be proud of for the rest of their careers and lives.  By all rights they should be booked from here on out!

I neglected one side story (and there are several) that had the first guy to bully Conor in school coming full circle and without giving it away I want to say that his character and side story were handled just as delicately as he was harsh, and I really enjoyed seeing such a take on an age old story played out the way it is.

I'm unfamiliar as well with the Director, John Carney, but he must surely love music (I was so taken with the music that I've already ordered the  Sing Street Soundtrack) and he must have been very sensitive to his own coming of age tale to bring this truly brilliant representation to the screen.  My kudos to him.

I guess the word I've used most in this review is 'universal' and that's because the themes are.  You'll relate to Conor and his crew in ways that will trigger memories and emotions of your own upbringing and awakening.  At the same time you'll be thoroughly entertained throughout with humor and insight and with foot tapping hip swinging rock and roll music to boot.  This beautiful film is an instant classic in my book and I only hope it reaches as wide an audience as possible during its existence.  I hope this review will help make that happen.",1468022400,2,7452,4.446730345334313

I would suggest that this movie may have had even greater impact and appeal if credit was given to the many good and righteous parents and leaders of Christian Schools and Universities who sacrifice much to serve so many children in need of God's truth and light.  In the end, Connor sets sail for the shores of London on a course set by God and motivated by a sacrificial love for Raphina.  Simply a wonderful movie with break-out potential.

7731241,4,B01E698FFC,"Eight years after John Carney won the hearts of Sundance audiences with his Irish musical-romance, ""Once"", and a couple of years after his less-successful but underrated ""Begin Again"", he's back once again with another heart-swelling tale of songwriting love with ""Sing Street"". Seamlessly blending the band dynamics of ""The Commitments"" with the teen coming-of-age antics of ""We Are The Best!"", the film is less romanticized than Carney's other films; the deeply rooted love is for the '80s pop and rock sounds of Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, Spandau Ballet, and The Cure. Infused with the energy of the era and the kinetic performances of the young cast, Sing Street is guaranteed to get you out of your seat and dancing in the streets.

Don't think for a second that there isn't a love story, though. Want to know why most guys start rocks bands? To impress girls, that's why. And that's exactly why teenaged Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) gets the idea in his head, to win over the heart of the mysterious and mature Raphina (Lucy Boynton), who has hopes of leaving poor Dublin for a life in London. He asks her to be in his band's music video, which is great except there's no video and certainly no band. Inspired by his older brother, Brendan, (a shaggy and terrific Jack Reynor), a stoner and a Yoda of rock music, Conor creates a group called Sing Street, named after the strict Christian Brothers school he is forced to attend to help his parents (Aidan Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy) save money. With his rabbit-obsessed guitarist and co-writer Eamon (Mark McKenna), Doyle cobbles together a group of young misfits whose tastes change as quickly as their MTV-inspired wardrobe.

While Carney has always been able to knock out a memorable track or two in each of his films, the soundtracks for those are very good, he takes it to another level with Sing Street's infectious score. What's amazing about it is how catchy each track is, and how quickly we become invested in the band's success. Granted, their aspirations don't go far beyond impressing Raphina, but we want that for them more than anything. That romance is incredibly sweet and dreamy in the way most school-aged crushes are, but what has real impact is the relationship between Connor and his family. The harsh economic realities of Ireland in the '80s has hit his parents hard, and while they argue over everything Conor finds relief in his brother's sage (meaning stoned) advice about the connection between women and music. When Raphina drives off with an older, seemingly much cooler boy, Conor tells Brendan the guy listens to Phil Collins. ""He won't be a problem"" he quickly retorts, giving his sibling the confidence boost to keep pursuing the woman of his dreams.

Carney strings together wonderful emotional beats like the notes in a perfectly-crafted song. Like his previous efforts, Carney has his artists performing everywhere and anywhere, using the most natural settings to capture an authentic feel. From a boys' messy bedroom to a grungy alleyway to a school gymnasium where the uproarious ""Drive It Like You Stole It"" rockets the film to another stratosphere.

To varying degrees all of Carney's films have had an aspect of wish fulfillment, but ""Sing Street"" is the most surreal by far, ending with the kind of spectacular romantic gesture that often defined movies of the time period. It's perfect for a film that is all about taking big risks, not only for the music but for love.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sing-Street-Blu-ray/dp/B01E698HZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sing Street [Blu-ray</a>]",1463788800,,3632,5.11973018549747

Sing Street is a perfect movie for somebody in my age group (plus or minus 5 years, probably). The events of the movie all took place in Ireland, so I couldn't exactly relate to the specific circumstances of the characters in the film (being an American), but there were a lot of things in the movie that were universal to anyone who was a teenager in the 80s - way too much denim, gigantic hair, gigantic frames, music videos taking over the world, and so much familiar music. It's a rare movie anymore that only plays music I recognize and actually appreciate - I even embarrassingly found myself singing along at a couple of points. I feel bad for those sitting near me. There was also a smattering of original music that was also really good. I was surprised at the lack of U2's music, though. What Irish band was bigger in the 80s?

I really enjoyed the story, even though it was an unlikely happy ending along the lines of a too-familiar theme: boy meets girl, boy goes the extra mile to impress girl, girl ditches boy...and then movie magic kicks in and the girl returns and boy ends up with girl. I prefer the ultimately depressing, but much more realistic story (and all too-familiar) in 500 days of Summer to this one. Happy endings never come this easy. And more often than not, don't come at all. You learn to appreciate what you get. There were a couple of distracting aspects to the movie - just about every kid in the movie, and a good many adults, smoked relentlessly and there were rampant broken families. But that could very well just be Ireland - or at least Ireland in the 80s. I wasn't there so I have no idea.",1463788800,,1768,4.37082066869301
7731243,5,B01E698FFC,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers.  Writer/director John Carney gave us my favorite movie of 2007 (Once) and one of the best from 2014 (Begin Again) so I had high expectations for this similar themed film.  Now when I say similar, I mean it is a film of relationships with a heavy dose of music, both new and old.  Set in the mid-1980s in Dublin, I suspect there is an autobiographical element in the story.  Conor/Cosmo (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) is a 15 year old kid living at home with his older brother, Brendan (Jack Reynor, a dead ringer for Chris Pratt) and sister Ann (Kelly Thornton).  His parents many will recognize from TVs Game of Thrones (Aidan Gillen) and Orphan Black (Maria Doyle Kennedy).  They are about to separate (no divorce in Ireland) for financial reasons and an extramarital affair.

To cut back on expenses, Cosmo must go to a Catholic boys public school.  As you would expect hes met with the usual hazing, bullying and an unsympathetic headmaster.  What you don't expect is that he eyeballs a beautiful girl smoking a cigarette across the street.  Taking advantage of a brief glimpse his way, he saunters up to her.  Raphina (Lucy Boynton) is a year older.  She tells Cosmo shes going to be heading to London soon to be a model.  He says hes looking for a model to be in a music video (MTV is all the rage) for his band  which he doesnt have.  Raphina agrees.  Cosmo needs a band!

While hes into music, he has no experience nor does he play an instrument.  But hes determined, and falling for Raphina.  He gathers a group of kids who have some interest.  Most prominent is Eamon (Mark McKenna) who looks like a young John Lennon.  Eamon can play just about any instrument and has a gift for writing music.  Together, with Cosmos lyrics it makes for beautiful music.

One of Carneys gifts is that he introduces wonderful songs into his films.  I won't go so far as to say the ones here equal the award-worthy soundtrack of Once but they are damn good none the less.  And if that isn't enough, there is some good stuff from the classic bands of the day including Duran Duran, The Cure, Hall and Oats, etc.  So what makes this film any different or any better from the deluge of similar, especially American made, movies of teen angst, budding love and getting the band together for the first time?  For one thing Carney actually shows you how a song is created.  He doesnt just write a script that has the characters talk about writing a song and then in the next scene, it is being performed.  We see how Cosmo gets his ideas  dreams, romance, conflict, confusion  which all play a part.  We see how Cosmo goes to the real musician and together he and Eamon work it out, musically.  Carney is also adept at showing a growing affection between two teenagers.  There isn't a scene where the boy snaps off the bra of the girl and they're off to the races.  Its delicate.  Its nuanced.  Its awkward.  And this is a great movie.  One of the best Ive seen this year.  Highly recommended.",1463356800,16,3008,4.516728624535316

8757773,5,B01E698FFC,"I remember seeing reviews of this film when it first came out, but it wasn't until a family member recommended it that I actually saw it. Even then, it took me a while to make the connection, because from the printed reviews I hadn't expected the hero and heroine to be high-schoolers.

Never mind. The dialogue snaps, the lead characters are adorable, and with a small allowance for movie magic the relationships and situations feel real. Now, if only all high-school bands played that well....",1537660800,,495,4.823529411764706
