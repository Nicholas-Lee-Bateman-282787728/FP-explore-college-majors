8654510,2,B00JXNBXQK,"This DVD release features both the original Spanish-language and English-dubbed versions of this Mexican horror flick.
The video quality is rather poor, ESPECIALLY on the original version; the English version is noticeably better.
The sound is passable. Disappointing, as I was hoping it would be much better looking a copy.",1494288000,2,324,5.5
8654511,3,B00JXNBXQK,Too much was cut from the English version. The Spanish version had a lot more footage.,1470009600,,86,4.4375
8654512,5,B00JXNBXQK,"Great cover art! Unlike many Mexican horror/lucha libre dvds sold on Amazon, this has Spanish and English language options. However, the English dubbed version is heavily edited with many deleted scenes and the picture quality is much lower than the Spanish original. Great low price on this obscure little horror gem. Highly recommended.",1466726400,7,338,5.39622641509434
8654513,5,B00JXNBXQK,"I saw previews of this film years ago, and never got to see it. I ran across this movie when looking for old scary movies. When I saw it I just had to have it. It is a classic. You don't have to see blood and gore to enjoy a very good scary movie!",1430697600,6,247,3.5925925925925926
