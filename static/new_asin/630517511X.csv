982655,4,630517511X,"It's still relatively early in the year, and yet, actresses are giving superb, Oscar-worthy performances.  No exception here.  ""Bettie Page"" is a strong film, about a cult pin-up icon that many are not familiar with.  This film could have stumbled into many cliches about the young, beautiful girl next door, who has a bad family life, gets raped, et. al., but the filmmakers, mainly director Mary Harron, shy away from those.  The interesting thing about this film is that, unlike many biographies, this film sets character-to-character dynamics aside.  This is a film about Bettie, and Bettie alone.  There is a brief subplot about the government's case against Irving Klaw (Chris Bauer), but it is never resolved.  The filmmakers want us to know that this is about Bettie, her life, and her struggles, and nothing else.  Beautiful Bettie Page (Mol) thought her life would be ordinary.  She marries at an early age, only to leave her abusive husband after a short time.  As an adolescent, she was sexually abused by her father, and it wouldn't be the last instance.  Later in the film, after leaving her husband, she is picked up by a guy under the ruse of him not having a date to the dance.  They soon pick up more guys, take her to the woods, and rape her.  Bettie decides to run from it all, and moves to New York to pursue acting.  It doesn't take long for her to get into modeling, but it's a bit different than the common perception of photography.  She begins to do ""specialty"" photography, mainly bondage, for ""special"" clients.  Working for Irving and Paula Klaw (Bauer and Lili Taylor), she begins to set her roots in the pinup world.  She also does nude photos on the side.  She also begins to develop a bit of a relationship with another model, Maxie (Cara Seymour, who I swore was Jennifer Jason Leigh, with a Miranda Richardson accent) and they do a few bondage films together.  Bettie meets other men, but always seems at a distance with them.  The same is said for her acting career.  She takes acting classes, but there is a distance placed between her and the stage.  No, pin-up modeling is what Bettie was made to do.  I cannot really give much more plot synopsis.  Not much really happens.  What the film lacks in plot, it gains in Gretchen Mol's great performance.  ""Bettie Page"", unlike other biopics (""Ray"", ""Walk the Line"", etc.) leaves more room to view the performances, rather than getting a whole lot of plot out in an hour and a half.  Mol's performance carries this film, and I really enjoyed seeing both the performance and the film.",1159747200,,2567,4.671875
982656,2,630517511X,"For anybody not remotely familiar with pinup modeling or the McCarthy trials who'd like something as unchallenging and candycoated as the 1950's this is a movie for you. For ninety minutes we're shown a sickeningly pc study of American history from the dim pov of the most prolific sex symbol of the time. With two books, a fan club, and a ridiculous ammount of information available it is truly sad that this is the best they could do. Culling the cheap Canadian waters HBO sought to make a well-shot, well-acted, stilted made-for-tv movie and succeeded with flying colors. It should come as no surprise that behind this calculated misfire is the writer/director team of American Psycho, who like before, have their lead star and cinematographer carry the film. However unlike the adaptation of Ellis' book (which originally had Cronenberg attached to direct) the material to work from for a Bettie Page biopic is too opinionated on both the left and right with the facts left to be found somewhere in the middle. It simply ends up mindless fluff. Ironic too that the main theme of American Psycho is how facades make you sick (or hide how sick you really are) and in this case we never crack Bettie's surface. Unlike the Foster book sited in the credits we're never offered the slightest glimpse of a lonely, troubled person. She simply loves Jesus and is impervious to all harm. I was amazed the cast did as well with the material including genre vets Lili Taylor, David Strathairn, and Jarred Harris. Gretchen Mol is a run-of-the-mill talking head and suitable for a Bettie whose raw feelings are forgotten in time beside pretty pictures. The cast merely make it watchable. It inevitably becomes spoof-worthy '50s propaganda that never shows Ms Page as a real person. It's unlikely there will be a film that ever will.",1159660800,3,1822,4.842948717948718
982657,3,630517511X,"I couldn't wait to see how this film would play out. Bettie Page was a trail-blazer in the Pin Up  magazines. different time in the 50's keep that in mind. today it would barely get a remark,but back then it was seen as something that would raise a eyebrow or two. Gretchen Mol does a very good job&is a Foxxy looking chick herself. the problem for me with the film is that the story of Bettie Page the person never gets any real time. so much is skipped over&glossed over&you feel that the Director&producer's were really on a tight budget. but Bettie Page is truly a interesting figure in the visual world&eye. this was a interestign film that made me want to learn even more.",1159574400,2,678,4.424
982658,4,630517511X,"The words ""Bettie Page"" conjure up images of bondage, beatings, interesting undergarments, impossibly high heels, and ""deviance"". And, well, they should. In the 1950s Page's work stretched the boundaries of what then passed as ""smut"". Though fairly tame by today's standards, the status quo reacted to these depictions in the usual way: Congressional hearings, claims of ""corruption of youth"", censure of the industry, and public shaming of those involved. Page never testified, but her work remained at the center of the controversy. Which, of course, multiplied her celebrity exponentially. So much so that her name retains an electrical charge even today.

""The Notorious Betty Page"" spans the early years of Page's life. Arguably the most eyebrow raising years. From her southern Tennessee youth to her eventual religious awakening, the movie depicts Page as a naive southern belle who walked nonchalantly into her notoriety. ""It's all costumes and dress-up"" she tells an appalled boyfriend as he gapes upon a ""Betty in Bondage"" sequence. ""It's disgusting"", he responds. They break up soon after. Page's later life, which apparently had its share of extremely low points, gets omitted completely. Probably out of respect for the 80 year old Page. Yes, she's still alive. Though she witnessed her twenty first century rediscovery, she has only allowed one or two recent photos. Like many aged beauties, she prefers people to remember her ""as she was"". The film ends with a thirty something Page preaching the Gospel to passersby. One tells her ""you shouldn't be ashamed for what you did. You should see the stuff they publish now."" She responds, unabashed, ""I'm not ashamed. Adam and Eve were naked in the garden, weren't they?"" Roll credits.

The Bettie Page in this movie never seems to realize why people want to take her picture, or dress her up, or make her go ""Raaar!!"" She seems almost oblivious, with the exception of one scene. A photographer has bound and gagged her, and, while snapping dirty pics, he sings some lewd lyrics. Page protests through her muzzle. When he removes it, she complains about his language citing her belief in Jesus. The photographer asks the obvious question, ""What do you think Jesus would think of what you're dong now?"" Page becomes reflective and philosophical while strapped spread-eagle to a wooden frame. This scene, one of the film's best, highlights the tension that exists throughout, namely, how did Page reconcile her religious views with her weekend career?  She answers, a little paradoxically, that God gave us all gifts which He intended us to use. That her photos ""make many people happy"" provides enough justification. That is, until the congressional hearings. Page, waiting in the wings, does double takes as the committee throws accusation after accusation against her ""questionable career"". The film makes this a pivotal moment. Her photo studio closed down, her name publicly, but not privately, defamed, Page seeks refuge in God. Regardless, she still doesn't apologize for her past. In fact, it seems a source of pride even to the Bible-wielding Page. So did pornography defile her? The film seems to answer no. In the end, the familar tension of smut as disseminating happiness versus smut as societal scourge remains taut. Obviously no film could resolve that issue, but the film focuses more on the happiness aspect of Page's life and work. She seems to enjoy it for its own sake, regardless of how or why she started down that path.

The movie includes remakes of some of Page's photography and short films. These look cute and kitschy to us now, but it's easy to forget that they represented the cutting edge of hardcore in their day. The opening scene demonstrates this perfectly. An undercover policeman at an adult bookstore has to specifically request magazines featuring Page's work. When the meek clerk presents the hidden material, out comes the badge. Contraband galore. To provide some historical perspective actual Page footage was included. The film's credits feature the real Bettie Page dancing. And the DVD includes a Page color film. In it she feigns sleepiness, yawns, stretches, smiles teasingly (as if she's laughing at something off camera), and strips naked.

For many Bettie Page represents a relaxing of 1950s morals. She seems to embody sheer human pleasure and proud unashamed beauty symbolizing happy acquiescence of the human condition. The film, however, doesn't reveal much of Page and keeps most of her personality shrouded in mystery. This enables audiences to come to their own conclusions. The film doesn't moralize, nor does it demonize the status quo. But this approach runs the risk of downplaying her early abuse and its implications. Regardless, the film remains a charming, highly entertaining, and thought provoking study of a name that still rings bells fifty years later.",1159574400,5,4881,5.157828282828283
982659,4,630517511X,"I saw this film in the theatre.  At the time I felt it was an engaging film but a little lacking in having a coherent point of view.  That said, the film stayed with me.  On seeing it again the reason for my continued interest lays in the sparkling performance by Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page.  This is the kind of work that's easily overlooked because some would dismiss Mol's work as a model playing a model.  Mol's Bettie, however, is a complex creature.  Bettie is a god-fearing woman who loves posing for the camera.  This doesn't necessarily mean Bettie is an exhibitionist but the camera loves her and she comes alive in front of the camera.  Bettie is also a woman who is comfortable with her body and has no problem sharing that with the world.  Bettie is focused on her job and is oblivious to the unsavory characters who may be exploiting her.  The film doesn't shy away from the traumas in Bettie's life such as her being violated by her father at a young age, a gang rape as a young woman, and an abusive early marriage.  Bettie's a trooper though and soldiers through life zestfully.  I recommend this film with reservations, though.  As spot-on as Mol's performance is director Mary Harron's film contains something of an incoherent viewpoint.  Is this film a feminist tract that intends to savage pornography?  Is this film anti-censorship?  Or is it a libertarian film that embraces the live and let live philosophy?  To the film's credit it treats Bettie's religious beliefs seriously and doesn't feel it negates her other endeavors.  The commentary track by Harron and Mol is good as far as enlightening the technical aspects of the picture(Harron experiments with both black-and-white as well as technicolor) but doesn't really enlighten you as to who Bettie Page is and why we should care.",1159488000,3,1809,4.743589743589744
982660,5,630517511X,"I really enjoyed this movie, brought a tear to my eye. I am quite familiar with Bettie's story, been a fan of hers for years.

She wanted so much to be an actress, but made a living doing modeling.

This film represents dreams lost, Bettie could have made it, but the Congessional hearing's scared her back to the lord. Good choice.

There is a deeper and darker chapter in Bettie's later life that was respectfully left out. I think this was also a good choice.",1159401600,3,462,4.411764705882353

982846,4,630517511X,"Bettie Page came from Nashville with a very conservative background as a devout Christian. In 1949, she moved to New York City to become an actress. She didn't achieve her dream as a movie star, but she began posing for cheese cake photos in mens' magazines. In 1950, while walking along the Coney Island shore, as depicted in this quasi-documentary, NYPD Officer Jerry Tibbs while off-duty introduced himself to her. Photography was his hobby, and he suggested that she had the appeal of a pictorial pin-up model. He offered to photograph her at no cost to her. And that is actually how she got started. Another true fact in the movie was how she met and married her second husband, 18-year-old Armond Walterson, after asking him out on a Miami beach. She was 12 years older, and it ended in divorce 5 years later in 1963. Comfortable in her own skin, she posed for titillating photos considered obscene and risqu in the 1950s but innocuous by today's standards.",1464652800,,963,4.738095238095238

982848,4,630517511X,"For the little I knew about Bettie Page beforehand, I figured she had been a sexy slut out to capitalize on taboo eroticism long before Madonna and porn stars. I was surprised to learn she was this innocent christian from Nashville that was hard working, intelligent, and proud of her beauty. Yet the film isn't totally devoted to being a biography of Bettie, but more so the awareness and business of 'glamour' for a underground fetish market. And the hypocrisy of a scantily clad Jane in a Tarzan movie, to a scantily clad Bettie acting out in a men's magazine. Alluring vs. enticement - or vice versa? Where the movie somewhat fails is what personal deviation (if any?) this may have caused Bettie's outlook on relationships, sex, and fame. A little too 'righteously naive' and 'escaping unscathed' for me to believe. But it's Lili Taylor as Paula Klaw that showed the more believable character in the end. That Bettie was a true beauty, and there was to be a timelessness for the work she and others had done that congress and the moral majority were never going to effectively stomp out and punish. Kudos to Mary Harron for always being so darin' to take the seedier sides of life and put some humanity to it. Whether we believe it or not, it all makes for a good story in the end.",1453075200,,1286,4.571428571428571

982850,5,630517511X,"I recall seeing Page in some of my uncle's 'mens' magazines when I was growing up in the 1950s, so when I came across this film my interest was piqued. I cannot say one way or the other how accurate this portrayal of Page is, nor can I verify if the time sequences are correct. What I do know is comparing photos of the real life characters and the actors the resemblances are remarkable. Especially Mol who is a dead ringer for Page.

The movie focuses on Page's involvement with the Klaws (brother and sister Paula and Irving), and her segue from photography model to short film roles that appealed to a specific demographic. There is a lot of time also devoted to the morals and mores, including laws during her era that have long since been repealed or struck down. It seems as though some of the focus of the film is a more prudish era using Page's story as a vehicle.

There are some flashbacks that provide insights into Page's character, and possibly explain the person she had become at the end of the film. However, every scene portrays her as bright, but naive. There is a sweetness about her, but there are some hints that she rationalized what she was doing as well and found solace in that until she found more solace in the church.

Some of the flashback scenes allude to her possibly being molested by her father, as well as her being raped early on. In the former case, it's only alluded by brief shots that suggest, but do not actually show any physical contact. Those are done mainly with facial expression and body language. Mol pulls that off masterfully. The rape scene, too, is not explicit. There is no doubt that it happened, but it was tastefully done (or as tasteful as a rape scene can.)

The only nudity scenes are not so much salacious as innocent, and are brief. I especially liked the fact that there was no true gratuitous scenes in the movie. Everything was filmed to portray Page's life, although, as I said, that portrayal does not tell the full story.

Finally, the cinematography is superb. A bonus feature of the film explained how different film stocks were used to depict different periods and locales. For example, the Miami scenes used a 50s style stock that gave those scenes a true sense of being there (if you grew up in that era.)

You'll come away with some sense of who Page was as a person during a specific part of her life. You will also come away with a respect for Mol's acting and overall production values. In some ways I am glad that Page's later life was not covered because it was somewhat sad and, according to some sources I checked, plagued with mental problems. Despite the uneven quality of the storyline I still recommend this film for folks interested in Page or the period depicted in the film.",1445904000,4,2761,4.512

Naturally when this movie came out I bought a copy of it. I was not disappointed. Gretchen Mol was the perfect choice for the lead. Betty page died a few years ago.

982947,4,630517511X,"I watched it on YouTube. It held my attention but only because I'm a fan of Bettie Page and I collect a lot of her vintage memorabilia from magazines to photos, etc. I started collecting months before I even saw this biopic. I had felt it was time to learn more about the woman I invest so much money in. I pretty much knew everything about her life, characteristic and past from the internet and reading various sites over the months. This movie brought no new info to the table. I watched it as if I've seen it already which was flattering because it made me feel like I knew more than the average fan probably knew. Gretchen Mol was an okay Bettie but she was definitely missing the sex appeal, the butt, the curves and the personality. She's cute, no doubt but looks like an average pin up model and her fake southern accent wasn't that believable. This movie was way too short to cover all of Bettie's life. They didn't get into anything personal about her past such as marriages. It was pretty much a film that expanded over her full 6 or 7 years in the lime light. You can only say so much about a photo shoot. I wanted a little more drama. She was more than someone who posed for magazines and opened the door to bondage taboo. She was a human as well. The black and white look was a nice touch. The actors and actresses were good but I'm sure Bettie had no approval in the making of this biopic. A lot of biopics don't get rights or permission which is why a lot of them fail. If you're a fan like me, you'll enjoy this but it you're buying this without knowing anything about Bettie Page herself, then maybe you should learn from her documentaries and interviews and have at this movie with a more knowledgeable perspective. 3 stars!

The story and script was not over the top and non-exploitive, and it did capture a slice and time of American history/culture (the post WWII America 1950's) when life seemed tame, safe, and somewhat boring? It was nice to see when contemporary America at the time had these slight aberrations of slight deviant behavior simmering underneath the country, questioning decency and morals in society, right before the 60's counter-culture was about to emerge. Overall, a great cast, decent script and cinematography (capturing the look and feel of the 1950's), and the beautiful Gretchen Mol capturing the look and spirit of the queen of the golden age of pin-up girls.",1353888000,,797,5.138461538461539

Ms. Page was portrayed as simple, barely inhabiting her own skin and unable to actually connect with anyone but her sister. Her behavior was directly at odds with her experiences, suggesting that either she didn't really have a clue what she was doing or that there were serious gaps and flaws in the movie's writing. For example, after she was raped, she's shown crying but then... nothing. It just gets dropped, with no suggestion that she dealt with/overcame the issue emotionally, and yet her behavior for the rest of the film suggests she didn't even remember that it happened. That is only one of several such contradictions.

All in all, there was ton of potential here - real stores of colorful, creative people and the kinds of real drama that define life. But all of it was kept shallow, skimmed over - they never truly connected with the material and it's a shame.

Couldn't the abuse have been portrayed as horrific, without being titilating, at least to the average sadism freak? I mean that sarcastically.

However, the biggest problem with the movie is that as good as Gretchen Moll is, Bettie had such a unique appeal that Gretchen can't adequately match it - but, I doubt any actor could have. Apparently, Bettie's qualities remain quite rare.

The movie does look great and so does Gretchen, but it's still a fairly standard bio-pic. For the reasons stated above, it could have been better, but I doubt it could have been great.

She was a man's dream and yet Bettie wowed anyone that would look at the photos.  Somehow those black and white goofy girdles, bras, chains, leather boots and garter belts looked campy, even then.  She came across sweet, seemed naive, but Bettie knew her power.  She loved playing dress-up with the goal of shock and awe.  Today's rock stars like Madonna, Lady Gaga, even Cher, do the same thing.  It gets attention and they know and love it.

Bettie wanted to be an actress, she arrived in the big City from Nashville, Tennessee.  As all young girls, she came to make her mark while she had the looks and figure.  Gretchen Mol does a good job playing Bettie.  There always seems to be some inferred sexual abuse as a child in the beautiful woman story, but it was not delved into.  Eventually her popularity and sadomasochistic posing becomes the target of the Senate.  She converted to strict Christianity, the way she was raised and moved on to something completely different: private life.  Bettie disappeared not wanting to be photographed as older and probably plumper.  She wants us to remember her as young and pretty.  I think she had a good time play acting forbidden bondage scenes.

So here is my take. It's a good movie. A simplified view (what can yo do in 2 hours?) of the life of a person who became an icon. Her picture was painted on countless war planes in WW2 as being the model of what they're fighting for.

She was called before the US Congress to testify about the porn industry of the time. This is like the MacArthur years of Communist hunting or the recent Congressional investigation of steroid use in professional sports.

There is some nudity, but it's very artistic. There's nothing beyond what Betty actually did according to the laws of the time.

The movie only lightly touches on her tragic past and all-together ignores other aspects of her life which surely shaped who she was and who she would become.

I caught this on television last night (30 may 10) and I thought it was so sweet. Bettie Page was a pure hearted innocent that Gretchen Mol caught with such charm. Even posing nude you somehow had the impression she was fully clothed: she never looked cheap or enticing, just a girl doing girl-next-door posing. The childlike embrace of religion and telling people in the park all about Jesus and naively going in a car with strangers to a remote place and being raped seems to fit with her simplisitc world view.

Bettie just didn't get that the pictures and bondage she posed for, could be taken ""sensationally"" by certain types of men, and seem lewd and exploitive to others...and drove away a man who would have otherwise married her. It was sad to see her auditioning on stage and acting so well only to have the director say,

""Well, I never expected to meet the notorious Bettie Page, thank you - NEXT! ""

Bettie looks perplexed and walks off stage not realizing that she has stigmatized herself out of an acting career. See the ending for yourself and decide what you think. Things follow you around: Linda Lovelace couldn't even keep a job as a mailing clerk one the employer found out about - ""L.L.""

As played in this movie, Page was a naive and devoutly Christian girl from Tennessee, who nevertheless, after moving to New York, became the main model of a genre that was considered extremely shocking, not to mention illegal, at the time (of course, by the standards of today's pornography, Bettie's photos look now almost innocent). Why she did so is never quite explained, unless you consider a flashback to a gang rape during her teenage years as a valid explanation. In a final analysis, you probably can't explain why a nice girl agree to model in what was then considered extremely shocking set pieces, except by falling into amateur psychology. Though the religion of her main photographers, Irving and Paula Claw, is never mentioned explicitly, it is nevertheless quite obvious - therefore, the most provocative thing in this movie is not the nudity but the subtext of a small town southern Christian girl exploited by callous Jewish pornographers.

983403,3,630517511X,"After reading Eric Schlosser's REEFER MADNESS (which details, among other things, the history of pornography and ""adult"" entertainment, including the U.S. government's attempts to outlaw such vices, First Amendment be damned!), I rented THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE, thinking that it might be interesting to see the '50s ""war on porn"" brought to life. While the film does begin with a Congressional inquiry into the ""illegal"" activities of Irving and Paula Klaw (who employed Page for a time), this angle is used as a vehicle with which to explore Page's life, and the anti-pornography craze soon fades to the background. When the topic is covered, it's done so superficially, with little attention to detail.

Which is all fine and good - after all, the film is called THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE for a reason - except the movie also fails to offer much insight into Page's childhood, her path to becoming a pinup model, or her life after sex work. Page's conversion to Christianity, for example, concludes the film - but the audience is left with little idea as to the how's or why's of her newfound fundamentalism.

All in all, THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is stylistic but superficial - which is frustratingly disappointing, given the subject matter. The filmmakers missed an incredible opportunity to examine not just the rise and retirement of the Notorious Ms. Page, but also government corruption and censorship, the beginnings of the sexual revolution, the effects of sexual abuse on women, and the state of feminism in the '50s.

Though THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is rated R, I thought it was rather tame. Only two of the photo shoots involve nudity; while risqu outfits and poses are depicted throughout the film, it's nothing you couldn't find on the cover of MAXIM or FHM nowadays. Two instances of rape are implied, though never shown, which is a relief - too often, violence against women is sexualized and glamorized, and I admire the filmmaker's decision to merely hint at the sexual traumas endured by Page.",1238976000,2,2016,4.976261127596439

983405,3,630517511X,"Born in 1923 in Nashville, Tennessee, Bettie Page endured childhood sexual abuse and a disastrous marriage before she arrived in New York in the 1940s.  Paige hoped to create a career as an actress, and indeed her talents were such that she was able to enroll in the celebrated HB Studio acting school--but it was a model that she would find fame, first doing ""cheesecake"" photographs for popular men's magazines of the day and later as a ""specialty"" model in bondage, S&M, and fetish photographs.  Although most models in these genres had very short careers, Page was so popular that her career ran about a decade.

Censorship issues put an end to Page's work as a specialty model in the late 1950s; by this point, however, Page was less interested in modeling than in Christianity.  She increasingly turned to the church, attending at least three Bible colleges and ultimately becoming a full-time employee for evangelist Billy Graham.  But the early years of abuse and her time in spotlight took a toll as the years passed.  In the late 1970s she experienced a complete mental collapse and spent some two years in a California state hospital.

A resurgence of interest in Page's work began in the late 1970s, but she herself would remain entirely oblivious of it until 1990s.  Living in poverty in a group home, she eventually sought to exercise control over the distribution of her image, and in consequence was able to live in some comfort until her death in 2008.  It had been a rocky ride for the woman known as ""The Dark Angel,"" true, but an interesting one just the same.  It is therefore somewhat disappointing that to date no film has successfully captured the essence of Page or her story.

THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is more or less correct so far as the known facts are concerned, but it never delves deeply enough to create a truly interesting script, much less story.  Although the film tries to organize the story within a framework the Senate Subcommittee Hearings on Juvenile Delinquency (which was a factor in ending Page's career), it lacks general focus and comes to a rather abrupt end when Page turns fully toward the church.

When all is said and done, THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is at most a mildly interesting portrait of the celebrated ""Dark Angel"" pin up, entertaining enough but not in the least memorable.  Bonus materials include an audio commentary, a making-of documentary--and, surprise, footage of Bettie Page, who was clearly a lot more sizzling and interesting than this little film allows.

That is not that case with `The Notorious Betty Page'.  There is a completely different problem running through the veins of this film.  `The Notorious Betty Page' suffers from direction that takes its material too lightly, making what could have been a deeper and more meaningful biopic feel almost hollow in parts.  It's very point-by-point and at times very vapid.

That isn't to say that it isn't somewhat enjoyable, and it certainly has its highlights, but as a whole `The Notorious Betty Page' could have and should have been `fuller'.

The film centers around none other than Betty Page, the famous pin-up queen who used her body and `god given talent to pose for men' to catapult her name and image onto the covers of magazines and the minds of men everywhere.  The film spends a few minutes giving us a little background information on Betty's childhood and adolescence before throwing us into her quick ascent into the world of adult entertainment.

Above anything else one must notice the brilliant performance given by Gretchen Mol.  Her portrayal of Betty Page is phenomenally on point, never wavering from her grasp of her characters inner struggles with life in general.  She manages to capture the air of the era (a feat captured by actresses like Julianne Moore in `Far From Heaven'), delving into a more mannered delivery, yet she remains fresh and natural, allowing her characters naivety and innocence to permeate her delivery and flourish within each scene.  When Page is behind the camera Mol comes to life, vibrant and casual and gallant, but she also manages to capture Page's separation from character, which can be seen in moments when she is confronted by fans of her work.

`The Notorious Betty Page' plays a little like `Ed Wood' meets `Gia' with the story gutted from it.  The direction has the air of Burton's masterpiece (both are shot in black & white and both capture the very mood of the time period) and the `rise to fame' story has draws to `Gia' (of course without the drug use) but `The Notorious Betty Page' feels empty in ways that neither of the other two films ever felt.  It's sad because Betty's lifestyle could have used a little heavier handling, for it would have added a darker edge that could have elevated the film, adding some depth.  Instead the film carries with it the same naivety that Page herself depended on and so the film winds up merely mirroring its star; albeit that the star fairs much better than the film itself.

`The Notorious Betty Page' is light frothy fun, but if you are wanting a more in depth study of character then there are certainly other biopic's to chose from (the two I mentioned in particular are great examples).  Gretchen Mol gets a clear `A' from me, but the film itself lands at the high end of a `C'.",1217980800,2,2980,4.722007722007722

Flashbacks of her early life are pitiful-poor young Bettie the victim is mistreated by one man after another, pouting and crying.  She was a strong woman in reality, but this film presents her as an abused creature to be pitied.  Although it is never stated, the movie implies that the reason she got in to fetish modeling was a direct result of her abusive and tumultous childhood.  Blech.

983507,3,630517511X,"I can say two things about this film. Gretchen Mol did a brilliant job for ""The Notorious Bettie Page,"" a bio-pic of the ""Pin-Up Queen"" or cult pop culture icon, directed by Mary Harron (""American Psycho""). Shot part in black and white, and part in color (and the colors you see here are soft like Technicolor), the film is also benefited from its period detail of the 1950s.

And what else? Not much. The film follows the events that happened in her younger days in Nashville and, though Mary Harron uses a restrained approach in showing them, some of them are truly painful ones. It also gives a portrait of Bettie Page in New York City where she begins taking acting lessons. She also poses and wields a whip before camera, but sweet-natured Bettie is also a very religious person. And as you know, she suddenly vanishes from the public eye.

Certainly ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" shows the life story of Bettie and her amiable personality, but they are described in a rather detached way. For all the superb performances from Gretchen Mol, we cannot relate to the person we are supposed to be interested in. Moreover, supporting characters are mostly flat. This is regrettable because we are not allowed to know Bettie through dialogues or emotional interactions with her and the film also misses the chance to explore the business world of photos and films Bettie Page appeared - Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor as Irving and Paula Klaw deserve more time.

The film gives few clues to understand her as a real person or cultural icon. The issue of censorship is only briefly touched in the ""frame"" section of the story. The film gives no answer as to why Bettie Page could attain such a unique status in pop culture history, but that is OK. After all, this is a biographical film about a real woman, but sadly the film does not show much about who Bettie Page really was, or how come she could be called ""notorious.""",1206921600,,1917,4.632352941176471

Keep in mind that this film is mostly focused on Bettie's modeling career with few other aspects of her personal life.  One reviewer here mentioned that a lot were skipped on Bettie's life.  In addition, there are other things mentioned here but there are no in-depth information.  So, I Wikipedia'd her and found so much more infomation on Bettie.

This film was interesting.  One, Bettie is portrayed as a country Southern girl with such naive innocence.  And this is the person that models in certain clothes and poses that were considered obsence and illegal.  Her pictures and films are considered tame compared to today's bondage scenes.  Nonetheless, she seemed to be enjoying her modeling career.

Even though she was a successful pin-up model, she struggled with her religious beliefs.  She could never really answers if what she was doing was wrong in the eyes of God.  In the end, she comes to terms with God and ceased modeling.

All I can say is that you're not going to find anything hot and spicy if that is what you're aiming for.  Instead, it's a biography of a Southern girl who has made it big as a pin-up girl that has eventually made it as one of the many aspects of a retro pop culture.

The music is spot on, and Gretchen Mol as Bettie and the brilliant Lily Taylor as her friend, agent, publisher and photographer turn in delightful performances.  Someday when Mary Harron has collected her second or third Oscar, a lot of people are going to wonder ""what was I thinking?"" when they look back and finally appreciate the masterpiece they let get away.",1184284800,4,1100,5.027472527472527

983514,3,630517511X,"Mary Harron, one of a slew of concerned filmmakers to appear in Kirby Dick's recent indictment of the MPAA This Film is Not Yet Rated, writes and directs her third picture.  The Notorious Bettie Page is about the cult icon and pinup and bondage model that influenced pornography's entry into the cultural mainstream.  Bettie Page unwittingly became kind of symbol of women's liberation long after she rediscovered Christianity.  She slipped into the mainstream in variable flashes in comic books, music, television, and of course a new generation of inspired Goth burlesque models.  This film is her biopic and unlike many biopics the melodrama is downplayed which is of course good for both the subject matter as well as the length of the picture (just 90 minutes).  It comes off as a bit more honest and real then some other biopics but on the other hand it sacrifices being as entertaining for these same reasons.  Strange considering the rumors of her violent life after she left modeling.

Bettie Page is played by Gretchen Mol and the rest of the cast is good but they are truly drowned out by a boring script, and of course Gretchen herself.  Mol's performance is anything but boring and shows a deep understanding of what makes Page a worthy icon. Mol seemingly disappeared for years and then suddenly showed up and did this.  I don't want to dwell on how daring she is for the nudity she does in this movie, because even without that kind of commitment and risk Mol deserves the highest praise possible.  She was outstanding and was arguably snubbed of some awards.

Mol is the only great thing about this movie. Page was naive to her situation and just happens to not be shy about showing off her body.  You can even see in some of the bondage photos with whips in her hand that she may as well be holding a duster instead...while delicious cookies are being prepared in the kitchen. That innocence combined with the suggestive subject matter is what makes Page so enticing and exceptional.  Gretchen Mol got that vibe just right and it permeates throughout this film.

In short, Bettie becomes a model and eventually meets Irving and Paula Klaw who begin shooting her bondage photos.  She then goes on to model for Bunny Yeager and those photos show up in Playboy.  Bettie gets caught up in a senate hearing about pornography and then she finds Protestantism and leaves modeling.  The film doesn't bother to address the more controversial and debated elements to her later life (those mentioned in The Real Bettie Page: The Truth about the Queen of Pinups).

Mary Harron's vision focuses on her career and then just before her disappearance.  These early years are worth knowing about even though the story doesn't contain some of the dramatic elements we might find in say Walk the Line or Ray. So it sticks to the public's perception of Bettie. Instead of going with the tabloid drama of her later life it focuses on why she is an icon and that is overall probably more important anyway.  There is more that troubled me though as the film also doesn't even touch on the political commentary it could have.  Maybe that's alright as well because Bettie Page didn't seem to understand or even care about her role in fighting censorship.  Something tells me there could've been a more exciting story here but on the surface The Notorious Bettie Page is a beautifully shot film with one great performance...perhaps that is all it needed.",1183593600,25,3445,4.764309764309765

983614,2,630517511X,"On the 26th of September 1983 a short dumpy 60 year old woman stood trial for the attempted murder of Leonie Haddad, a lady whose husband had recently died and had agreed to take in a lodger who came via a housing authority for the elderly. Haddad was not made aware that her new lodger had, in fact, come fresh from The Patton State Mental Hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously. Haddad soon realised that something was `rotten in Denmark' when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting prophesies about' seven Gods'. Haddad's fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife announcing that ""God has inspired me to kill you"". Haddad managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest. It was a miracle she survived. The lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent, kicking and screaming, back to the laughing academy.

Ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity; but not for the brutal attacks on her innocent victims, but for her incarnation of 25 years earlier when she was known as the `Queen of the Curve's, the `Tennessee Tease' and `Miss Pin Up Girl of the World' - the Notorious Bettie Page.

  Director Mary Harron, mainly known for `American Psycho' takes us back to the glory days of a legendary cheesecake and bondage model (played solidly enough by Gretchen Mol) who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography and whose influence can be detected in everything from comic books to catwalks. T.N.B.P is day-glo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the 1950's where Page, with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers, becomes the number one star of pocket sized men's glossies with titles like Wink, Tab and Parade. Her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to God. The overall style of the film is light and frothy and only darkens momentarily with an allusion to her father's incestuous attentions and a sexual assault which inexplicably appears to have no discernable effect on her. Mol plays Page as she seems in her photographs, happy, carefree and fun - even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility. The film concludes on the upbeat with Page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages, personal tragedy and decent into murderous insanity which lay before her; avoiding what I think is the essential core of Page's story - rebirth and resurrection.

  Having emerged from a decade of incarceration Page found that her cult had been in the ascendance since the mid 1980's and that she had become a huge underground icon, during which, many were asking ""whatever happened to Bettie Page"". Her `mysterious' disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories only adding to the allure of her legend. When the world's media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past and she was soon giving interviews for magazines, T.V and being photographed at Playboy parties with the likes of Pamela Anderson and the equally tragic Anna Nicole Smith.

She found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her `glory years' but in the glare of this `resurrection' it was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light.

The only notorious thing about The Notorious Bettie Page is they left out the part when she became truly notorious.

She pulls off the caliber of acting which would normally make the academy take note, but the field was ripe with talent in 2005 and 2006, plus the story of a pin-up cannot compare to that of uber sweetheart June Carter-Cash.

In many aspects of the film she is very creative: she elects to tell Bettie's passage into the world of nude/girlie pix modeling from her Nashville,TN Bible Belt beginnings in terse black and white while meandering comic relief passages are in startling color; she has chosen a superb cast (especially Gretchen Mol inhabiting Bettie Page; she recreates the feeling of the 1950s down to the finest detail.

The problem with a biography of a sensation such as Page, despite the probable truth of her attitude toward life and her career, is in the manner in which the story is told.  Yes, the smarmy aspects of the scandal which surrounded Page are touched upon are even candy-coated or merely passed over quickly.  Mol is terrifically credible (and beautiful!) in her  portrayal and she is supported by some fine actors (Lili Taylor and Chris Bauer as the funny-but-naughty brother and sister team who introduced Bettie into the world of S&M/bondage shots and films that resulted in a national investigation of pornography), David Strathairn as Estes Kefauver in charge of the hearings over the scandal, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson and others.

The movie features Gretchen Mol. And while she she barely fits the original's 36-24-35 figure, she perfectly plays the Nashville native's open minded innocence, charm and fun loving nature. Whatever you might already know about Bettie Page, I can guarantee that you will learn something new about this classic pinup girl.

For example, did you know that this sweet n' simple girl missed being class Valedictorian by only an A-...or that she was at the zenith of her modeling career at the age of 35?

This story is a real life ""Perils of Pauline"" flick, introducing us to good and evil characters as well as Bettie herself.  Many of you are sure to enjoy the depiction of classic Irving Claw pictures, which seem tame today but were provocative and scandalous in their time.  Our heroine was right in the middle of this turbulent change in adult pornography.

""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is a tale of youthful optimism, censorship, faith, and the search for happiness.  In the end, Bettie is able to reconcile her career as a porn star with her religious guilt and spiritual beliefs.

It was not what it expected. The girl is portrayed neither as a complete airhead nor as a genius. She seems reasonably bright about some things but incredibly nave.

However, the film is definitely a tribute to Page, an incredibly independent and strong woman for her time and despite her upbringing and assorted challenges. I feel, however, that although Betty is an icon, this film (which did modest box office) is the nadir of her resurgence; she will now settle quietly back into the hearts of her true fans, who were fascinated by her before the hoopla.

Gretchen Mol does an adequate job at portraying Bettie, although Bettie had a much better body.  Ms. Mol is thinner without the athletic body of Bettie Page.  Ms. Mol is pretty enough, but is not as lovely as the real Bettie.

Ms. Page began to gain weight after retirement (hence no photos permitted - even now that there is a revival of her work).

She did spent a decade in a mental institution when she was older.  She evidently attacked her landlord with a knife.

All that aside, Bettie Page definitely exuded something rare and missing among contemporary models (Jenna Jameson (pure sleeze) and Dita Von Teese (a horse faced wannabe who hooked up with Marilyn Manson to advance her lackluster career) as well as other lesser known Bettie Knockoffs just don't exude the same joy and animation of Bettie Page.

Betty a small time girl was used by an abusive husband and left after she received a beating to find her way in New York.  One day while strolling on the beach she is approached by a police officer who is an amateur photographer who would love to get some modeling shots of her on the beach.  The innocent photos on the beach causes quite a scandal with the onlookers, apparently because the photographer is black.

Betty's photos seem to get her more work and she is introduced to a married couple (the Klaws) who make ""special"" photo shoots for special clients who want something different.  This gives Betty regular weekend work and many of her shoots involve photos of her in leather and either being bound or tying up other leather bound women.

During one of her shoots she innocently takes off her top and then her bottom but the photographer says to her if he shoots a picture of her bottom front he will go to prison.

I was enthralled by this movie and the extras give a lot of interviews with the cast that talk about many of the things that Betty wore as being normal fashion today.  Additionally there is a preserved short silent film of Betty posing innocently (incidentally as beautiful as Gretchen Moll who played Betty is, she cannot match Betty's figure or beautiful looks).

As a woman living in the time and cultural tension that she did, Bettie Page truly helped evolve society's views on sex and fetishism (or at the very least, rebel against the overly conservative views that were in place).

This film, shot mostly in black and white with a few poignant scenes shot in color, gave the audience a decent look into the world of fetishism as experienced by Bettie Page, one of the world's first true pin-up queens. Fetishism, of course, isn't for everyone, but that doesn't mean there's something wrong with it. Healthy, safe, sexual expression is a wonderful thing, and I think Bettie Page helped pioneer this particular view on human sexuality.

While the film tended to drag a little during some parts, it was nevertheless fascinating to witness the internal and external struggles of Mrs. Page (who had been married and abandoned by her husband prior to entering into the modeling world) as she attempted to navigate through the social stigmas of the lingere/fetish modeling she enjoyed.

Gretchen Mol plays the title character, and appears to be a perfect embodiment of Bettie Page. Her voice inflection, body language, modeling poses, and mannerisms fit Bettie Page to a T. She is striking, and looks remarkably like the real Page. It would not be difficult to confuse the two. If you watch one of the special features in which a film reel of the *real* Bettie Page does a striptease, you will know exactly what I mean. Gretchen Mol deserves an award for her outstanding performance and amazing ability to capture her character perfectly.

983813,3,630517511X,"I think the first question that should be asked is ""why did it take so long to do a bio pic of Bettie Page?""  As a high priestess of kinky 50's era pin-up pictures, the time span of her popularity has far outlasted the length of her modeling career.  That alone would seem to have made her story worthy of an authorized or unauthorized biography.

The second question then must surely be, since it took so long to bring Ms. Page's story into mainstream cinema, why couldn't they have done it better?  The fault most assuredly does not rest with Gretchen Mol, who gives a fantastic performance as the model who's become synonymous with bondage and other kinky images.  She strikes an excellence balance between the innocent girl from the south, and the high heeled, corseted mistress of a thousand sordid magazines.

No, the problem seems to be the story and the direction.  Ms. Mol strives to depict Bettie's differentiation between her front-of-camera job and her real life.  But the events as they unfold on the screen don't help to explain how she became such a phenomenon and then abruptly retired.  People come into her life, and then vanish, only to drift in later (one boyfriend in particular) with no explanation whatsoever.  Another relationship begins with her innocently asking a sunbather to take her picture on the beach, and the next thing you know they are practically living together.

I guess however, that a fair movie about such an iconoclastic figure as Bettie Page is better than no movie at all.  And Gretchen Mol is certainly worth watching, both in clothes and without.  She might even start a new trend toward dark hair brunettes with bangs.",1162944000,,1666,4.783216783216783

Please, folks, wait for Ken Burns' 18-hour History Of Bondage for this level of detail.

What we have here is a story of a charming young woman who, alas, did not feel guilty about posing for photos wearing naughty underwear.  The film makes no attempt to psychoanalyze and surprisingly, it passes no judgement on Bettie, the 1950s, or on Bettie's religious beliefs.

How close this is to Bettie's actual life I cannot say.  And if it was a movie about global warming I would, like other reviewers, be concerned about possible omissions or distortions.  But in this case I'll settle for a fascinating story with extraordinary performances.

However, I do not agree that just because you film a movie in black-and-white, that automatically makes it effective as a period piece.

What makes a movie a period piece by definition is the time that takes place in (the 50s.)  Whether the film stock is black-and-white, or color should make little difference if the script is good, and actors are good.

Adding color in the last third of the movie comes across as nothing more than a gimmick.  The audience sees this little gimmick when Bettie Page comes to Miami from New York.

Bettie Page was the world's first pinup/bondage model.  She was and is also the best.  She is still alive and the movie covers her childhood, and her career through the early 50s.

Gretchen Mol did a fine job with her portrayal of Bettie Page.  However, I believe the movie could have been better, and could have given the audience a more full portrayal of Bettie Page's life.

983880,3,630517511X,"THE NOTORIOUS BETTY PAIGE is intelligently filmed, using grainy black and white film stock that gives it a period piece feel. And, unfortunately, this is the most notable part of the entire production. Although actress Gretchen Mol does an excellent acting job (even when completely naked), the story fails simply because there's little to no understanding as to Betty's motivations.

That Betty Paige was one of the first celebrated pin-ups in the world is well known. Her leather and bondage photos launched her into an underground fetish realm that soon sparked congressional hearings on the matter, too. But it was her infectious innocence that most people comment on and Mol certainly got that aspect down pat. Where the movie blurs is the understanding of Betty's life experiences, and this portion fails miserably thanks to a script lacking such content.

For instance ...

In the beginning of the flick we're with Betty while she sits in church with her mother. From this we are supposed to surmise (I guess) that Betty is fairly pious. But sitting in church does not equate to piety. In fact, Betty is seen flirting with a young boy, so this didn't jive with any sort of religious binding she may have felt towards the end of the movie; she does ""turn to Christianity"" in the end, as history tells us. So everything from her nave attitudes towards her pictures to her comfort level with nudity didn't make sense in terms of her religious attitudes at the beginning and end.

The other portion that is bothersome is the lack of any angst. Betty is so comfortable with what her fetish photo sessions that we don't feel there's any problem with it. We never get outside of Betty (except for the congressional hearings which, again, are lacking any intensity), so never really see what others think of what she's doing, thus giving us no sense of any wrong-doing. The congressional hearings are just barely touch on and give little to no understanding as to how they got started, too.

That Betty is possibly molested by her father is also alluded to but never fully explored. The assumption (again, I'm guessing) is that the audience is supposed to make the connection between her childhood abuse and her choice as a sexual icon later in life. But we only see one little snippet (about eight seconds of actual film time) on this topic and then it is summarily dropped.

Although the great black and white photography and the fascinating history surrounding this sexual dynamo may be appealing on one level, the fouled-up script makes it too easily forgettable.",1161216000,2,2566,4.84703196347032
983881,3,630517511X,"In our silicon enhanced, post heroin chic pornographic society it's hard to imagine a world where pictures as tame as those shown in ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" would cause a scandal. They did however and this movie biography of pin-up and S&M model Bettie Page serves as a reminder of the conservative world where nude photos of natives in National Geographic were OK but not nude pictures of a white woman. Sending such pictures through the mail was a crime and it was a far different world. ""Paige"" captures the feeling of this world well with its black and white grainy photography but it's all surface and the film is saved by a stunning performance by Gretchen Mol as Page. She so completely invests herself in the role that when watching real footage of Page that is included as a DVD extra I felt as if it could have been Mol if not for the slight differences in the way the two looked.

Mary Harron's film follows Page from childhood where she was already practicing to be a model by pretending to pose for pictures by the boys to the end of her career. Always a religious person Page viewed her modeling career as little more than giving enjoyment to others. She felt that God gave gifts to everyone to use as best they could and that hers was to model and act. Shot in black and white except for some splashes of color during sequences where Page is on vacation in Florida, ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" has a number of strong performances including a nice turn by Lili Taylor as one of the photographers who launched Page's career in S&M films and stills.

***Spoilers ahead***

Although the film is enjoyable I felt that it turned into a rote biography and we never really got underneath Page's skin to find out the impact of a gang rape, her failed marriage, long term relationships and how they might have colored her career. This isn't the fault of Mol but the writer and director. We're not given the big drama scenes that we need to find out more. Many of the other roles including that of her long time boyfriend/actor from New York are underwritten and they aren't given much to do on screen. While we do see scenes portraying the senate investigation about pornography that occurred (where she was cited by name as one of the models)and the fact that she was called as a witness again Harron never provides us with a chance to dig behind the cheery facade that Page puts up most of the time.

***End spoilers***

The DVD comes with a commentary with actress Mol, director Harron and writer Geneviere Turner. We also get a ""making of"" featurette about the production of the film.

983883,4,630517511X,"The late 1940's/early 1950's was the time Americans were staking out their share of the American Dream.  World War II was over, shortages of items such as rubber, butter, and gasoline evaporated, thousands of new homes were built, expanding the suburban landscape, and young couples started their families.

 The era brought a new contentment to a nation reeling from the Great Depression and the war in Europe and in the Pacific, but it was also a repressive time.  Adult magazines were what today would be considered softcore:  provocative images with a smattering of nudity.  Young women in high heels and lingerie, sometimes in bondage poses, dominated these publications, and Bettie Page became one of their most popular models.

 ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" provides a look at the mom-and-pop naughty pictures industry of the early 1950's, when legitimate movie stills stores went into the lucrative sideline of taking risque photographs and selling them to their ""special"" customers.

 Bettie Page (Gretchen Mol) is a sweet Tennessee girl, despite the fact that she is sexually abused by her father and her mother refuses to let her date, even in high school.  She is also the victim of a gang rape.  A salutatorian at graduation, Bettie defies the stereotype of the dumb sex pot.

 Uninspired by the prospect of a career teaching school, she heads for New York City to become an actress.  In New York, she takes classes with an instructor (Austin Pendleton) who uses the Stanislavsky Method.  To support herself, she takes ""acting"" jobs modeling.  These sessions involve her posing in scanty outfits to rooms full of men snapping pictures.  This leads to jobs with professional photographers, and soon Bettie Page becomes the most famous woman to grace the cover of a men's magazine.

 Director Mary Harron has created a nostalgic portrait of not only Bettie Page, but the times in which she lived.  Shot in both black and white and color, the film has a nostalgic feel to it.  Because the images of Bettie and other women are so exaggerated, they are far less provocative today than amusing.  Considering the quantity and variety of adult material on the Internet today, one can actually find the naughty images of Page quaint.

 What makes the film click is the central performance by Mol.  She plays Bettie as a woman unashamed of her body or the photos she poses for.  She is earning a living, making people happy, and not hurting anyone.  We believe this Bettie is not a lascivious mantrap, but a nice girl who has discovered that she can make a living as a model.

 Mol's performance is especially remarkable because it could have easily gone to caricature or wide-eyed innocent.  This never happens.  Bettie likes the people she works for.  They treat her politely, they pay her, and they appreciate her.  So, in a sense, she has found herself a second, nurturing, protective family many miles from her southern home.

 The film has a strong supporting cast:  Lili Taylor and Chris Bauer (sister and brother Paula and Irwin Klaw, homegrown producers of racy pictures), David Strathairn (Senator Estes Kefauver, head of an investigative committee), John Cullum (a Nashville preacher), and Sarah Paulson (Florida photographer Bunny Yeager).

 Harron has captured the style of the stag films that featured Bettie Page by recreating excerpts.  Amazonian women, made taller by impossibly high heels, hold whips, prance around in leather corsets, and tie each other up.  With abrupt edits and awful acting, these excerpts illustrate the amateurish production values of films many men found exciting.

 Today, producers often gear their movies and TV shows to specific groups, guided by scientific demographic studies.  Before anyone knew what demographics meant, magazines and films were being turned out for a loyal, if non-mainstream audience.  Rated R, ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is an interesting companion film to Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood.""  Both focus on 1950's individuals working on a shoestring, trying to make a living in a fickle, cult entertainment industry.",1160179200,2,4077,5.090634441087613
983884,4,630517511X,"THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE delivers a smoking performance by Gretchen Mol.  The actress had to gain 20 pounds to play Bettie Page, but she eloquetly captures the spirited freedom that the pin-up girl is known for in all her shots.  The story opens up with the congressional investigation into Irving Klaw and other nude photographers who shipped materials through the post office back in the 1950s, then flashes back to Bettie Page's early years in Tennessee.  Time slips by as the film seques rapidly through Bettie's life and how she came to be America's sweetheart/pinup dream girl and somehow never lost the innocence that clung to her.

Bettie Page is a living icon of feminine sexuality and has unleashed generations of women who have become more and more independent.  Although the movement was already in place and would have progressed on its own, Ms. Page is a recognized force in that movement.  Gretchen Mol brings her own free-wheeling, fun-loving take to the role and is a delight to watch.  She's acted in several movies, including THE SHAPE OF THINGS, GET CARTER, THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, DONNIE BRASCO, CRADLE WILL ROCK, and THE ROUNDERS.

Although light on actual plot, THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is a great biopic showcasing one of the most lasting enigmas ever to seize the imaginations of generations of men.  The photo shoots of Bettie, from the ""camera clubs"" to Bunny Yeager, are amazing reinditions for anyone who has picked up the coffee table books by Richard Foster and others, or the artistic takes on Bettie by Jim Silke and Olivia De Berardinis.  All the most remembered poses hit the movie screen.

Bettie Page fans will love this movie, though they may find some of their favorite Bettie lore is missing.  Some may not find favor with the black-and-white film treatment, but the color segments of Bettie are kind of jarring.  She's at her best in the black-and-white shots, more natural.  If you've ever been slightly curious about Bettie Page or the world of the 1950s pinup girls, THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is a great DVD to take you into that world for a little exposure.",1160179200,2,2107,4.8655462184873945
983885,4,630517511X,"""The Notorious Bettie Page"" focuses on the time in Page's life that made her ""The Pin-Up Queen of the Universe"", from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s. The film moves quickly through her early life and first marriage and doesn't detail Page's religious calling or her mental health problems later in life. Director Mary Harron cowrote this film with Guinevere Turner as part docudrama of Bettie Page's extraordinary modeling career and part commentary on sexual mores of the 1950s and panic over the dissemination of provocative images. Recalling the style of post-War docudramas, most of ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is black-and-white, including some archival footage of 1950s New York City. The palette changes to garish Technicolor for Page's magazine covers and the time she spends in Miami, which somehow seems perfectly natural.

In 1955, Senator Estes Kefauver (David Strathairn) called Bettie Page's employers, the successful publishers Irving and Paula Klaw (Chris Bauer & Lili Taylor), to testify before the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency. Senator Kefauver felt that sexually deviant images, such as the fetish photos that were the Klaws' specialty, were causing ""murder, suicide, and psychosis"" in the nation's youth. We backtrack from there. The image of a pretty and proper Southern lady, Bettie Page (Gretchen Mol) arrives in New York in the late 1940s to make a fresh start after a divorce. Page dreams of an acting career, but becomes a fabulously popular and uninhibited pin-up model after being discovered by a glamour photographer while strolling on the beach at Coney Island. The Klaws, brother and sister owners of Movie Star News, take Bettie under their wing and introduce her to bondage modeling.

Bettie Page always looked so guileless, accessible, and natural in her photos. That was her appeal.  She loved being nude. She loved that her photos made people happy. She saw nothing wrong with any of it. ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" portrays Page as incapable of being anything but genuine. A gracious, sweet Southern belle who was simply not hung up about nudity and enjoyed posing for pictures. Page was so trusting of people that I think she must have been very fortunate to have worked with photographers who paid her well and treated her well. The film suggests a connection between Page's abusive sexual experiences early in life and her cheesecake modeling. But Page avoided explicitly sexual poses and seemed unaware of her photos' implications. Audiences will decide for themselves if the connection is plausible. Last but certainly not least, Gretchen Mol is radiant as Page, and her admirers won't want to miss this.

Although, in this age of information overload and internet availability and social networking, most fans today know more about Bettie than most fans did in the 50's, 60's, 70's, or 80's, this film still told us all a few things we did not know before. No one ever knew that Bettie had been molested by her father, or that she had been gang raped, mainly because she kept that part of her life secret. It wasn't until the makers of this film spoke with her about making the film that she opened up and mentioned these facts so that the film would be more accurate than not about her life. I admit that this film does not mention any of her later failings in the 1970's, but I am OK with that. I love the fact that this film ends with her becoming a born-again Christian just as the 1960's are about to begin. As a matter of fact, I would go so far as to say that this film just may be the best ever recruitment tool for Christianity - Here we have the queen of pinup models, who also posed nude and in fetish photos, who eventually gave up what could have been a more promising career, and gave up her fame, for the solace of Christ!
