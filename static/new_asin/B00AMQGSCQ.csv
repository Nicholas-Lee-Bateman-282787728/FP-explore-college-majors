5451385,5,B00AMQGSCQ,"We were planning to get chickens for their eggs and keep in our backyard.  I watched the video with my kids.  Becky, the presenter in the video, is a little quirky, but she gives great information about raising chickens.  The kids learned a lot about what to expect from raising chickens from the video.  Now they are enjoying having their very own backyard chickens, and having ""eggs straight out of the chicken's bottom"" as my youngest son stated.",1401148800,4,449,4.717948717948718
5451386,5,B00AMQGSCQ,Happy with content and a great learning video for our 4H kids and adults . Would be great in classroom too,1391731200,,106,4.095238095238095
5451387,5,B00AMQGSCQ,If you like learning from a video instead of reading you might like this DVD. This is for beginners so if you already know a lot about chickens this is not for you.,1365379200,3,164,4.0
8553868,1,B00AMQGSCQ,Halfway through she was talking about brownies but the video was making a nest out of a large plastic tote?? Not only that but the information is sketchy. PLEASE do additional research before getting chickens...,1525132800,,211,5.057142857142857
8553869,2,B00AMQGSCQ,I stopped watching after she showed the things you can give chickens to eat.  Please don't ever feed your chickens molded food or bread. These things can make chickens get a condition called sour crop and they are not healthy for them. I hope the rest of the advice is better.,1523923200,2,276,4.411764705882353

8553874,5,B00AMQGSCQ,We are new chicken keepers and this video was very informative.  Becky is passionate about what she does and it shows.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs some help getting started with chickens.,1514678400,,210,4.805555555555555

8553876,2,B00AMQGSCQ,"We're planning on starting our family backyard coop this month, and wanted a video my kids could watch to help them learn/understand about chickens and get them more involved as they are not yet old enough to 'read up' on them with books/internet information  (what chickens/roosters were, how to care for them etc).  This STARTED okay....she started by going over the anatomy of the chickens - my kids belly laughed at the rooster trying to get away from her.  She spent some time going over a few different breeds of chickens and their feed.  However, my kids ended up being more distracted by her ever changing appearance during the 'production' though (pieced together on home video over 10-12 different filmings for each topic).  She used several non-professional statements like 'there is more than one way to skin a cat' (which my 6 year old then asked me what it meant) and 'pain in the butt.'  A LOT of time was spent on the 'how-to of constructing cheap nest boxes out of Tupperware bins, or cheap portable outside coops out of PVC pipe. Basically a how-to for folks that want to keep the chickens on little-to-no budget, using tarps and things they can find around the house/farm.  We intend on investing a little more in our birds living quarters on the front end, so would have been nice to see info on different options for keeping them (from higher end coops to low end), discussing more about their basic needs (re: the reasons for shade, where/why they sleep, ideal set ups for coops, how often they need socialization with humans, etc).  Her suggestions are really only relevant for folks in balmier climates (she's in FL).  In climates where you have colder winters, we couldn't have used any of her set-up suggestions since we need to protect our flock from old weather.  I think very good intentions....but could have been done better.  My kids (who are obsessed with learning about chickens and not hard to hold their attention) all left after 40 min.  We turned it off after an hour.  Unfortunately since we already started viewing, we can't get our $$ back.",1455580800,2,2081,4.747222222222222
