8045135,3,B00076WUTG,"Warning: This Amazon offering is only part (less than half) of the  complete

75 minute video. It ends at a suspenseful part.

The movie is interesting and the acting is real life rather then the polished

Hollywood acting style.

I would enjoy it if it were complete. How can you do this Amazon.com?",1174867200,,300,4.584905660377358
