8120888,4,B000FDECGK,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this movie.  Would it mainly be some sort of sexually-focused movie, something poorly acted, something cheap?  It had good reviews, and I speak French and Spanish, so I thought that this might be interesting.  Knowing Spanish didn't help all that much, because the non-French dialog was in Portuguese, but the subtitles got me through those parts.

You can read about the plot elsewhere, and it might be a good idea to read or refresh yourself with the myth of Tiresia, the blind seer.  It is the pretext, if not the context, of this movie.  What this movie really explores is the duality of life: male/female; priest/pervert; old/young; taker/giver; and finally, alive/dead.  I found this movie fascinating in that nothing was totally as it seemed, that each person or situation held its opposite.  Tiresia embraced that duality and it gave him/her sight.  She/he was happy not to too narrowly define her/his gender, and it was the embrace of this dichotomy and duality that attracted everyone to him/her.  Someone who lives in opposite worlds at the same time comes to see beyond what most people see, and so Tiresia was sought out.

A complex movie indeed, and one that I would highly recommend!",1403827200,,1241,4.8619047619047615
8120889,4,B000FDECGK,"This is an adult film and if rated in the USA, it would be NC-17. It definitely is inappropriate for anyone under 17. It was inspired by something from Greek mythology, but is set in modern France. It has some very disturbing scenes. Without looking up reviews, I cannot say that I understood what the director was exactly trying to say. It does have some expositions of a part of society that are not talked about openly, so I would say that this lack of exposure probably explains somewhat my lack of understanding of the themes that the director had in mind.",1359417600,,561,4.509803921568627
8120890,3,B000FDECGK,"I liked the movie, but it got a little too ""French"" at the end - the ending made no sense at all.  I'd like to see what Hollywood could do with the topic.",1329955200,,154,3.6666666666666665
8120891,3,B000FDECGK,"My suggestion to anyone transgender interested in seeing this
film is not to do so. I myself am a sort of transgender known as
androgyne (someone with the gender identity of both a man and a
woman -- or neither) and I found this film to be stifling and
disspiriting. I think the effect would be worse for someone who is
transsexual. The transgender character is abused both physically
and spiritually in this film like I have seen in no other, and
the film's hyperrealistic visual style makes the suffering all
the more palpable.

I was drawn to the film because of the androgynous aspects of
the original myth of Tiresius, and thought that the film would
embellish and augment different things than it did. All it did,
really, was heighten the misery of the situations. Its attempts
at poetry are cynical, ironic, and paradoxical. As a morality
tale, it is appalling, and it reveals the sick underside of the
church in a whole new way.",1302048000,4,936,4.63855421686747

Synopsis: Teresia (Clara Choveaux) is an alluring transsexual from Brazil earning a living in France as a prostitute. She is picked up one night by a customer (Laurent Lucas) who takes her to a secluded location and makes her his prisoner. Fearful of what could happen if he is discovered he blinde Teresia and leaves her for dead secluded road  Tiresia is rescued by a young girl named Anna (Celia Catalifo) who nursed him/her back to health. Upon healing Tiresia now possesses the gift of second sight and begins foretelling coming events to anyone who will listen.

Critique: I had high hopes for the '03 film `Tiresia'. While I'm not generally attracted to erotica, the fact that the storyline was based on a Greek myth that dealt with second sight immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately for my tastes this modern interpretation simply didn't life up to my expectations.

Positives:
- `Tiresia' is successful at creating a smoldering, brooding atmosphere and lots of existential angst that produces the feel and texture of a grander drama just beyond the veil of the mundane drama unfolding the screen.
- The soundtrack is highly original and perfectly enhances the perception of otherness.
- The production values are first rate throughout.
- There are also some very good, though subdued performances.

Negatives:
- The pace is exceedingly slow and the dialogue just isn't profound enough to keep the audience fully engaged.
- The storyline drifts into incoherency at times and the ending is unsatisfying.

Maybe it's just too nihilistic for me, but whether that's the reason or not it's definitely not something I'd care to watch again which is my bottom line in evaluating any film. However with that said I'm sure there's a body of film fans out there that would love this film.",1200700800,7,1848,5.003257328990228
