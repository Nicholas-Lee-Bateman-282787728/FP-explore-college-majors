5435653,2,B00AIQD5JO,"My 7-year-old son loves pokemon and enjoys these 13 new episodes of Pokemon B&W that he can watch them whenever he wants.

However, in both DVDs, there were a 3+ minutes trailers prompt right after my son put the DVD into the player. The trailer including the preview of many other Japanese aminations with violate scenes (including Bleach, Zetman.... ,etc. Those animations are for teenagers or adult audiences, not for young audiences like Pokemon). My son was shocked by scenes and had to cover his eyes and asked for my help to skip them. I am really unhappy with this company that did not careful with the preview rating.",1369008000,5,626,4.743119266055046

5435657,5,B00AIQD5JO,"This is the third 12 episode set containing episodes 25-36. They are:

25: Emolga and the New Volt Switch!
26: Scare at the Litwick Mansion!
27: The Dragon Master's Path!
28: Oshawott's Lost Scalchop!
29: Cottonee in Love!
30: A UFO for Elgyem!
31: Ash and Trip's Third Battle!
32: Facing Fear with Eyes Wide Open!
33: Iris and Excadrill Against the Dragon Buster!
34: Gotta Catch a Roggenrola!
35: Where Did You Go, Audino?!
36: Archeops in the Modern World!

This third set has some new Pokemon being caught, but no new gym badges. They are travelling to get the Fourth Badge the whole time in Nimbasa City. Some of the Pokemon do show/learn new moves and master ones they already knew. Team Rocket is also more prevalent in this set.

The set itself is similar to the other sets in that it contains 12 episodes, has no extras, and is nicely done in widescreen. It does have a trailer/commercial opening with alot of different anime titles (Naruto Shippuden, DeathNote, Tiger and Bunny, etc). It's nice to see more different Pokemon being done on the discs again. This time it's Emolga and Excadrill (Oshawott and Snivy are on the first set and Tepig and Pansage are on the second set). Overall, another very good set with a VERY good price.",1363737600,7,1243,4.615384615384615
