6891385,4,B00R041FXA,Where is Episode 2? I bought season pass and only have one episode. Episode 2 that aired on PBS 1/25 was available on iTunes yesterday (1/26).  What's up? Love the show and want to see it in a timely fashion.,1422316800,21,208,4.2
6891386,5,B00R041FXA,I absolutely love this new series. It is helping to ease my craving for Inspector Lewis. Thanks to Masterpiece for giving us another quirky historical mystery series.,1422144000,5,166,5.185185185185185
6891387,4,B00R041FXA,"This is the first series, which aired last fall on ITV in the UK and has just started on PBS. There are 6 episodes.

I'm giving this one 4 stars, but only because there's only been one episode so far to review an it needs room to grow the character development a bit.

The murder mystery element is the traditional style of whodunit. You're dropped right in to early 50's small-town England, and all the sets are flawless, which is what we've come to expect. Post-war Britain was a lot more austere than what we see here, but the characters do seem to be realistic, rather than corny caricatures. Our hero is a vicar/reluctant detective, played by the handsome and able James Norton, with enough vices to keep him interesting.  He forms an easy friendship with the police inspector, played by the ever dependable Robson Green, who seems at first to be quite hard-boiled but we soon see is a rather cheerful family man.

It appears to be a worthwhile addition to the crowded field that this genre has become, but just different enough to set itself apart, which makes it definitely worth watching.",1421712000,11,1096,4.634020618556701
6891388,5,B00R041FXA,"Enjoyed this very much. Interesting, good characterizations. Peaceful (for a murder mystery). I look forward to many more. We could all use some stress-reduction instead of what we usually get on TV.",1421625600,5,199,5.25

6891390,2,B00R041FXA,"Having read one of the Sydney Chamber's novels a few years back, I must confess to being somewhat disappointed in the televised series, which, with each ensuing episode, is rapidly spiraling into a more uninspired - and uninspiring - mystery featuring an Anglican priest who is fairly adept at solving crime, as was the character from the novel, yet unlike his fictionalized counterpart, the series leaves much to be desired in the portrayal of this drinking, smoking, spiritually apathetic priest.

Changes have also been effectuated to the script that irreparably distorted the original mysteries, making them dull and contrived, while also adding elements of crassness here and there which are nonexistent in the book.

Based on its own merits, Granchester does have potential. While the storyline lacked originality, and plodded along too predictably, the characters of Chambers and Inspector Keating are the only noteworthy aspects to emerge from the hash that was made of it. This is one instance where the adaptation did not simply lose the flavor of the books - it simply lost all flavor whatsoever, however, James Norton and Robson Green do their absolute finest with the rather prosaic material. I am willing to continue watching in the hope for improvements, but those changes will need to be profound if Granchester is to be salvaged.",1421539200,21,1346,5.169724770642202
6891391,5,B00R041FXA,"When gruff Detective Inspector Geordie Keating (Robson Green) first encounters Anglican vicar, and WWII vet, Sidney Chambers (James  Norton) he is annoyed.  The good vicar thinks D.I. Keating's recent closed case suicide might really be a murder.  After bonding over backgammon, D.I. Keating comes to realize the vicar's warm and sympathetic manner coaxes secrets from witnesses, and potential suspects, which makes the vicar a potential asset and ally.

Set in post-war 1950's Cambridgeshire - near Cambridge - in the village of Grantchester, the scenery stars along with the inspired choice of actors. Cambridge is used for some street scenes. James Norton as the lanky and fair vicar is a non-judgmental, boyish vicar with whom you would like to go to the pub - he prefers strong whisky over the more clerical sherry choice. Interestingly, in real life James Norton has a spiritual bent. Norton read theology at Cambridge and journeyed to Nepal where he became intrigued by Buddhism. The non-preachy, non-doctrinal spirituality adds a little depth to this series which is refreshing. Robson Green as the detective inspector combines twinkle with grumpiness, and for comic interludes, Mrs. McGuire (Tessa Peake-Jones) is the taciturn, disapproving housekeeper of the vicar who judges everyone and everything, including the dog.

There are a few potential love interests to add spice to the series, but the real action portends to be in the crime-solving relationship of Detective Keating and Vicar Chambers.  For anglophiles, this will probably be a 5-star series as it has the necessary ingredients: a detective and sidekick (although the vicar functions more as the leading amateur detective with his understanding of human nature and ability to solicit secrets), a gobsmacking attractive English backdrop with proximity to Cambridge, engaging supporting characters in the form of a housekeeper, some love interests, and a really cute black lab puppy combined with whodunits to solve.  Another season has already been commissioned, so you won't be left wanting for too long once this six-episode season is over.  The series is based upon mysteries written by James Runcie.",1421539200,173,2176,5.379411764705883
6891392,5,B00R041FXA,"It may have been the Dreary Fifties (at least in the U.S.) but it's anything but dreary in a new series (for us here in the States) that has certainly caught my eye and my attention.

  It is ""Grantchester""!  Set in 1953, which surely was a trying time  in the U.K. as the War had been over only eight years, this series seems to set that aside and instead dwell upon a scenario that the Brits do best:  police detective stories on both the telly and in excellent books.  Combining (for the better) Father Brown with touches of Graham Greene ( and relying upon others for the basic premise), this series is a pure delight.  Alas, each segment is only an hour each (at least in Series 1), but that aside, it certainly commands the viewer's attention.

Young Sidney Chambers (James Norton) is the vicar of Grantchester, a small town near Cambridge.  One would think that such a quaint village would be dull, even boring for a vicar, its citizens, and even the constabulary, but fiction kicks in and dull doesnt appear in the vocabulary. Sidney, a veteran of the War himself, finds himself faced with all sorts of predicaments, precarious situations, an uncertain personal life, and, yes, murders.  He soon finds the local detective inspector (Robson Green) to be sympathetic and willing to listen to his ideas about ""who done it.""  They make a good team, after an initial slow start.  Of course, there's the smothering motherly housekeeper and a new puppy and a romantic interest designed to keep us waiting for the next episode:  will they or won't they?

But murder's the game (or at least solving it) and this series handles it quite well. Kudos to the creators.  (I see where there is a Season 2,  I can hardly wait!)",1421539200,96,1719,4.62046204620462
6891393,4,B00R041FXA,"I was so impressed by James Nortons' performance in `Death Comes To Pemberley' that I decided to check out other material in which he plays a main role.

This program involves Sidney Chambers an Anglican Priest and former WWII vet who is the Cannon for the Anglican church in the village of  Grantchester (near Cambridge).  He supplements his time between pastoral duties by assisting the local police detective solve crimes.  Think of him as the ecclesiastical version of Batman. The show is less about the mysteries that Sidney solves, than it is about an examination of British society in the post war period of the 1950's. Topics include racism, the class structure in England , euthanasia, marriage and homosexuality.

There is also a frank look at the life of Sidney Chambers is suffering from  PTSD as a result of what happened in the war. He could clearly be defined as a progressive minister who has a great need to be of service. However as the show goes on it appears as if he entered the ministry more as a means of assuaging his guilt and making amends than a sincere desire to serve God.  He clearly is a man of faith and wants to use that faith to help others.  But you also get the impression that he would not be a minister if it had not been for traumatic experiences he experienced in the battlefield.  Still he makes a very inspirational figure due to the fact that he is not self-righteous or preachy, and displays many human relatable human failings.

In all the program is okay, but I believe that there is much missing from the book  and which should have been kept in the series in order to make it move along smoother. One of the biggest problems I had with the show was his long time friend Amanda Kendall (played by Morven Christie). She comes across as very unsympathetic in the role.  Like a spoilt princess who decides that she wants to marry someone at her station...yet still expects Sidney to be at her beck and call and not move on.

James Norton is the best thing in the entire program. Like his character Pemberley, he cuts quite the dashing figure.  I don't think that I would ever have called a man in clerical garb `sexy' until now! I could argue that it's his weakest performance. But it has much to do with the fact that Sidney often comes across as a one dimensional goody-two shoes. But still I found him admirable.
Strongly recommended for those who like British costume mysteries and fans of James Norton.",1419638400,310,2451,4.553530751708428

6891406,5,B00R041FXA,"Wonderful series over three seasons, so far.  Heartwarming, British series set in the real village of Grantchester, England, just outside Cambridge.  Sidney is a CofE Vicar cum Detective, but the story line is so much more.  Series made a huge star of James Norton and utilized the great talent of the aging Robson Green.  The paring of the two along with Tessa Peake-Jones and the other cast members and even a puppy/dog made for one of the best human dramas in recent memory.  Even though it was on Masterpiece Mystery, it could have just as easily been on Masterpiece Classic.

Just hope Norton returns for one more season, but last I read, it was doubtful.  Even if the series moves on with another actor, it won't be the same.",1519344000,3,731,4.62015503875969
6891407,1,B00R041FXA,"the vicar and priest working together to solve crimes was a great premise.  But when the vicar's character started acting un vicar like, and not representing who he was supposed to be, it really turned me off.  The story lines got a little off the rails a bit-going away from solving crimes..  I gave it a few more episodes than I should have and had a sex scene thrown up in my face-TOTALLY out of place and offensive.  There was absolutely NO warning-that episode should've been rated TV-MA.  I am DONE.",1519084800,2,505,4.5054945054945055
6891408,5,B00R041FXA,"Another high mark for PBS show. I have to admit when it comes to British show I am a sucker for it  and PBS sure knows how to deliver good television. The acting is wonderful, the stories are refreshing and the location is a typical back to the 50s post war era. I was hoocked on the first show and I was delighted to see the serie is going to last ...hopeful for many more seasons.

6891410,2,B00R041FXA,"This is no ""Father Brown"" and I mean that in the harshest way possible. My kids and I so enjoy the Father Brown series with this humble, gentle priest always concerned with redemption and
displaying so many virtues and such kindness no matter what the crime or how dark the situation. The show is uplifting and thoroughly entertaining. Then we see this ""vicar"" who seems to spend most o f his time mooning over the woman that got away, not to mention smoking, drinking to the point of alcoholism and even having a one night stand with a woman he meets in a bar. He rarely mentions God at all, nor does he seem to be interested in the people in his life that he is supposed to be shepherding. They should have made him a bar tender or a railworker,, anything but a vicar of Christ. The stories would be much better if not for the complete lack of virtue one expects to see in a series whose main character is supposed to be a man of faith and service. Watch the show if you care to, but leave any expectations of true pastoral care at the door - you will find the series more interesting if you completely forget the fact that Sidney is supposed to be a man of God. If your looking for family entertainment with a background of Faith, skip this series entirely and watch Father Brown on Netflix instead.",1517443200,4,1302,4.318367346938776
6891411,4,B00R041FXA,"I loved this show, the actors and the reality of the minister who lives with PTSD from time to time up until the very last of the final disc and I was so angry at the ending.  Being an Atheist myself, I felt let down after all the years of regretting the loss of the love of his life because his religion did not allow divorce.  I'm still glad I watched it and loved the interaction between the two men and how human both of them were - just the way it ended seemed so unrealistic today.",1517184000,,487,4.010309278350515

6891424,5,B00R041FXA,I love Granchester. Seen it twice which is unusual for me. Not the usual mystery.

6891425,5,B00R041FXA,"Grantchester is yet another excellent PBS series, which is based on The Grantchester Mysteries, which are collections of short stories written by British novelist and television producer James Runcie. The story line of Grantchester centers around the extracurricular crime-solving exploits of a young Anglican vicar, who works with a veteran detective in the village of Grantchester, near Cambridge, England, in the early 1950s. Grantchester is actually a great detective procedural, which is characterized by superb writing and plot development, with murder mysteries that are intriguing, gripping, and suspenseful, replete with many interesting twists. In addition, it highlights several important cultural and societal issues that were just beginning to emerge in the forefront of the collective British consciousness during the middle of the 20th century. James Norton delivers an outstanding acting performance with his brilliant portrayal of Anglican vicar Sidney Chambers, and the acting performances of the talented members of the supporting cast are also stellar. Grantchester is a decidedly intelligent, engaging, and entertaining PBS detective series, which merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1507680000,13,1238,6.0397727272727275

6891505,2,B00R041FXA,"Why the comparisons to Chesterton?  I thought I would like this and was disappointed;  I pushed on through all 3 seasons to give it a chance to redeem itself.  Ah, redemption...funny how God is not a part of this series at all.  And that absence makes the comparison to Father Brown a ludicrous one.  At one point when Sidney is challenged about celibacy he curtly says, ""I am not CATHOLIC!""  Chesterton's character, Father Brown, was steeped in his Catholic faith and reflected it as a strong, unwavering beacon of Truth.  HOW does that compare in any way to this pathetic, wavering, fellow who breaks all of the commandments?  At another point when Amanda rather sensibly asks Leonard about the Anglican Communion and their opposition to divorce when the breach with the Faith happened as a result of Henry VIII and his desire for a divorce, Leonard answers her, rather meekly, that there were more issues involved.  Window dressing.  Again, ""non serviam,"" ...man's rebellion against God by choosing his own desires over God's commands.
The church scenes in this series show no kneeling, no praying, no liturgy...man is seemingly the ""higher power"" in this sanctuary because we see only Sidney back-lighted by the brilliant stained glass window as he talks to his flock not about the Mystery of Faith, not about God's Will, and God/s Grace but about ministering to each other.  When he counsels his parishioners or even when he accompanied that poor boy to the gallows, I heard no real faith.  You can't tell me this is a vicar....I didn't buy it.  I was Anglican once and my priest would not have been so humanist, so relativist.  I can hear the objections, ""These are basically mystery stories;  the character is a vicar, so what?""  It does make a difference.  Only if the vicar believes his faith does it make sense to make a story line out of the indissolubility of marriage and the disordered nature of sodomy.  My Anglican priest was also an Archdeacon.  The spiritual health of the priests under his charge was of utmost importance to him;  he was their spiritual director, he did not just come to tea and drop bombshells.  This series gives a distorted view of the clergy in my opinion.  Even though I am no longer an Anglican and I believe they floated into dangerous waters in the Seventies, the Anglican Communion in the Fifties still functioned faithfully following the traditional BCP.  The problem with this series is the problem with Modernity:  remove God and man is thrust on his own devices.  The outlook becomes bleak, inevitable, and a bit boring and we watch his fall.",1501459200,7,2591,4.794582392776523

6891574,5,B00R041FXA,"I loved this series! The friendships that are depicted between Sidney and all of the other is real to any age. Sidney's spiritual struggles are true for anyone, especially someone whose main character trait is compassion. Great Show!  I cannot wait for Season 2.",1494806400,,262,4.954545454545454
6891575,5,B00R041FXA,"What I really enjoyed about this is each episode had a beginning and an end to a mystery, while character development was a vein that ran through it. I looked forward to Season 2.  It captured me in the first episode and never let me down. I will watch season 2.
I also liked that I could watch an episode and come back later for another because there were no ""cliffhangers"" but rather an excitement about how the characters would emerge in the following episodes.
I also felt that the social issues of the time were addressed very well. The same issues of racism, homophobia, the right to die, and others that we still face today, especially now.
I love the acting, the story line. I love PBS!",1494028800,3,694,4.421875

6891625,2,B00R041FXA,"Really folks,more liberal fascist jargon. I watched season 1.2 in its entirety and was bored with the toffs routine and the black man wrongly accused and etc etc.  A typical plot from the Obama era that now seems a trite cliche of a script.  Norton and Green are endearing - but I can do without the liberal moralistic jingoism  especially of a juvenile and manipulative nature.",1489449600,2,378,4.696969696969697
6891626,4,B00R041FXA,"Since I first watched Happy Valley (outstanding show), it took me a few minutes to see James Norton as the kind, compassionate (albeit alcoholic) Vicar in Grantchester; he had been burned into my brain as the embodiment of evil from Happy Valley. Grantchester has its own layers of evil, but Norton, a WWII vet with clear PTSD and self-medicating with booze, plays the affable Sidney Chambers brilliantly. Be ready for huge ""willing suspensions of disbelief"" as the good Vicar becomes an honorary copper, working along side his older, but equally alcoholic and war-scarred, Inspector Geordie Keating. There are some very ridiculous scenes where, for example, the police are about to leave the station to interview a suspect, and Sidney says, ""Let me go alone."" And THEY LET HIM! (What the Dickens??) But, overall, you have great visuals, interesting and conflicted characters, and an underlying tale of repressed souls doing their best to make their way in post-war England. If you like the Morse, Lewis, etc., shows, you will likely appreciate Grantchester.",1488412800,4,1058,5.192982456140351

First, I like it because it's good clean entertainment ...nothing I have to turn it off if my grandchildren walk in the room :-)  I find the setting in an English Village to be somewhat peaceful yet at the same time wonderful stories erupt. This shows me there's not a lot of difference between the city and the country when it comes to solving crimes :-)  I particularly like the time frame of this movie, and wish there were more of these types of programs to watch.

I have only watched 2 episodes so far so its a little early to tell what my final grade will be. But based on the first two episodes I look forward to continuing through all the episodes of the first 2 seasons. Basically my wife and I are pretty selective about watching an entire series.

6892682,5,B00R041FXA,"If you like British mystery shows this is for you.  I stumbled across this two year series and instantly got hooked.  The young vicar in the small village of Grantchester is a natural sleuth who pairs up with the local detective to solve crimes, mostly murders.  There are a large number of characters including a female friend for whom the vicar has strong emotional ties but the vicar never proposes marriage and she ends up marrying another man.  This interacting relationship is woven into the series for the full two years.  I won't spoil anything for you but the dynamics of this relationship and the solving of murders makes for an appealing combination.",1485388800,,661,4.814159292035399
6892683,3,B00R041FXA,Too similar to many other programs produced by the British. The pace is extremely slow. We are treated to long periods internal monologue informed by the same flashback moments. The subplots are what one could expect. The only real point of interest is the examination of homosexuality in Britain in the 1950's.,1485388800,,311,5.0

You can do much worse with your time than enjoying this wonderful series from our British cousins. The story-lines are believable, and the subject matter is modern enough to almost make you forget that the series is set in the period of the early post-World War II years.

6892743,5,B00R041FXA,"Terrific casting; main characters are complex and dynamic. The interaction between Norton and Green is the centerpiece of episodes that aptly shift between comedy, pathos and darkness.  Grantchester's grit lies in is its continuous exploration of the grey areas in ""real life"" and the Vicar's personal struggle in making personal ethical choices in a changing England --that often push back against what is traditionally acceptable  in faith or law. Not only fun, but rich and thought provoking.",1485302400,,495,5.415584415584416

The actors are all second to none and the relationships between the leading character (James Norton as Sydney) and the others are especially well developed and fun to watch; Robson Green as Geordie, Morven Christie as Amanda, Tessa Peake-Jones as Mrs. McGuire who steals the show every-time she is on screen), and Al Weaver as Leonard.

The story lines are really good--no dark violence or scenes just for shock value.  The English really know how to write murder mysteries.  Lots of light moments intertwined within the story. The icing on the cake is that it is a clean show that portrays religion/religious folks not as intolerant monsters or serial killers, but regular people dealing with life in light of their beliefs--that is pretty much unheard of in films these days!  I am really hoping there will be a third season!",1485216000,,589,4.85

6892919,5,B00R041FXA,I enjoy British detective shows and this one has the added benefit of a main character who is a gifted amateur. The relationships between Sydney and the detective and between Sydney and Amanda keep me coming back for more.  The humor is another layer that makes the show one of my favorites.,1484784000,,291,4.596153846153846

6892938,5,B00R041FXA,"There's nothing I like better than a good British mystery. Nevertheless, I put off checking out Grantchester because the idea of vicar as detective seemed just a bit much. I was wrong. This is an excellent show with an intriguing mix of sleuthing and personal foibles on the part of the two main characters. James Norton and Robson Green are superb.  Tessa Peake-Jones adds a delightful touch of gritty humor to round out the show, and Morvin Christie is a woman any man could fall in love with.",1484784000,,495,4.625

He's clearly more interested in that than in the clergy, and spends a lot more time on it.  Actually he spends the most time drinking and womanizing.  He's got PTSD which is presumably why he's always drinking, but if death is so disturbing to him why does he choose to surround himself with it?  By the end of the season, I just didn't care enough to find out.",1484697600,,479,4.348314606741573

6893459,4,B00R041FXA,"(I haven't finished this series yet, so the rating could change!)
I'm three episodes in and I have to pace myself, because there's only about 12 eps.  Easily bingeable, but I want to savor it. The premise: 1950s post-war England. A handsome, brooding vicar finds himself questioning the deaths of some of his parishioners. Teams up with a gruff detective. Helped along by his housekeeper, a fellow clergyman, and an unbelievably adorable puppy named Dickens. (Okay, the puppy doesn't actually HELP.  Still cute.)
Interwoven with the cases are Sidney's personal struggles with loneliness, PTSD,  and interacting with people who have a wide range of reactions to his profession. It sounds like kind of a downer, but he's so caring and self-effacing that it's actually quite beguiling. Definitely more character driven (which I enjoy!) and less about solving the crime itself. It focuses more on the human motivation behind the various murders and other crimes.",1484092800,,958,5.207792207792208

Don't stop after the first show; push on and you will be so glad you did.  Each episode builds on the last in regard to the ongoing underlying plot and character relationship development.  The episodes are very good as stand alone murder mysteries, but significance of the series as a whole sneaks up on you.  There's real quality and depth to Grantchester.  The actors were well picked for their roles and the characters draw you deeper and deeper into the series as it evolves.

6894146,1,B00R041FXA,"I am not sure why I find it so annoying, but the series crams modern sensibilities into a 1950's era detective series to the point of being distracting. The writers seem to spend far more time attempting to treat lesbians, abortions, gays, atheist, and bi racial couples as common place in the 1950 (all that was in a single episode) than they do writing intriguing mysteries. The main character is an alcoholic vet suffering from post traumatic stress and probably a bit depression. It seems the writers could find interesting and sensitive ways to handle him. Instead we get a modern morality play where most of the characters regularly announce they don't believe in God and a priest who would rather do anything than his job. An Anglican priest having a crisis of faith might be worth watching but this isn't really. It isn't bad, just too on the nose to hold my interest. It works out to be just another predictable UK oblation preaching political correctness ad nauseum.",1483401600,23,976,4.781065088757397

6894149,3,B00R041FXA,"The story lines are a bit artificial.  The ""vicar"" (pastor) of a church would have too much to do in the middle of the week for someone to have so much time to investigate crimes.  Further, his sermons, most of which are after a death he has been investigating, are shallow.  They show the attempt to give comfort outside of a trust in God.  In the series one is to trust the church, or the state or other institutions.  Such trust is no ultimate comfort.",1483401600,3,455,4.305882352941176

It's nice that the vicar gets along with the detective unlike other similar shows (ie Father Brown mysteries) while still being human and not always agreeing.

6894313,4,B00R041FXA,"Beautifully captures the wardrobe and setting of the early 1950s. The vicar is quite modern in his sensibilities as opposed to many of the other characters who demonstrate the unenlightened misogyny, racism and homophobia associated with that period. The juxtaposition makes for much of the dramatic tension in the series, along with issues such as the Cold War, the death penalty and good old-fashioned revenge and greed. I first became aware of James Norton in the Netflix ""Happy Valley"" series where he plays a sociopathic rapist/kidnapper/murderer. I was impressed with his ability to play the young vicar in this series.",1483401600,,625,5.26

6894318,4,B00R041FXA,"The first season DVD consisting of 6 episodes is an entertaining series, if you don't question the happenings too much. Most scenes are shown through a cloud of smoke, as the main  characters seem to be chain smokers and hard drinkers, as well.

Sydney is the moral compass, although a bit flawed, who balances out his deeply flawed cop friend Geordie, whose thirst for justice makes him bend too many rules.  Parallel to the interesting crime plots are the vividly portrayed primary and secondary characters' personal lives.  This series doesn't shrink back from exploring the controversial in ways that make the viewer set aside rigid beliefs in order to consider many different points of view.  The acting is superb and the flavor of the era is captured perfectly.  It's worth watching multiple times--always a good test for the superior drama.",1483315200,,683,5.008849557522124

6894376,4,B00R041FXA,"Well crafted series, interesting characters and acting talent, engaging though unlikely partnership between the battle-weary small town cop and observant young clergyman. Two things were disappointing/annoying:
1) Cliche presumption that a devout person must surely be torn by deeply conflicting desires for purity and debauchery (Ugh. Give me a break. Discipleship is not the denial people assume it is; many believers are happy and comfortable with their value system and do not put themselves in compromising opportunities as this young man of the cloth did like a sad little personal failure loop), and 2) The non-stop tension in the forbidden love interest. What the heck? Was her marriage choice really about cultural expectations or her own hidden agenda for the selfish gratification of status and wealth? The Morven Christie character was never developed enough for us to glimpse more of her than a constant peripheral flirtation with someone she was not married to and by her own choice. I found her failure to commit to something - anything - super annoying. I kept wishing her hair and her fashions were more flattering, too. Oh well.",1483315200,11,1146,5.2
6894377,5,B00R041FXA,"Granchester highlights the joy of british mysteries. The acting is superb. Robson Greer plays a jaded police officer who as seen and knows too much.

6894694,5,B00R041FXA,"Like so many Masterpiece/ITV programs, this is first-rate in story and acting.  There are times when I want to knock the editor on the knuckle for the choppy cuts; however,  the lighting, cinematography, and period staging seems to make up for that flaw. The ""Mrs. McGuire"" character has timely commentary in challenging moments. Norton, cannot help the fact he has a presence on-camera that reminds of a young Richard Chamberlain or Clark Gable.  The stories are quite contemporary, so don't let the fact this the era is set in post-WWII prevent you from enjoying.  Vicar Chambers counterpart and bosom-buddy  Detective Geordie, played by Robson Green, has an adept acting ability. He could go as deep or light as this show would need. His character is an agnostic; so, viewpoints are represented on both sides. The final epilogue is summed up in Sidney's weekly sermon highlights the emotion and lessons learned from each episodes theme.  Enjoy!",1482710400,5,947,5.077419354838709

6894799,5,B00R041FXA,"I will be brief. I had serious reservations about the series because the combination of an Anglican vicar and police officer in 1950s England seemed so improbable. However, it works splendidly here. The big surprise is that this goes far beyond a routine ""police procedural"" and deals with real human issues like disastrous mistakes in choosing a mate, substance abuse, depression, closeted gay lifestyles during this era, and a host of other things one would not expect from a ""police show."" The proof of the pudding with a series like this is whether or not you empathize with the characters so that the fiction becomes real to you. On this level, the series succeeds wonderfully and deserves all five stars.",1482624000,4,710,4.925

6894803,2,B00R041FXA,The show has potential but it is not realized within the two seasons that are currently available. Sydney's pining for a lost love and her morbid behaviour following a premeditated loveless marriage is too dark and too contrived.

I don't really care about your characters' habits, but when they drink and smoke in every single scene in the whole series with close ups, it takes away from the show.

6894925,5,B00R041FXA,"Grantchester is a British mystery series, firmly entrenched in the present wave of productions from BBC and others that appear to be pleasing to both British and American audiences. For example, you don't need subtitles to understand just what some bloke with a thick Cockney accent is talking about. The plots and subplots mesh well and make for enjoyable watching. The stories hinge on the early 1950s friendship between a vicar and a police detective both youngish and recently returned from the atrocities of WWII. They're each heroic and equally tragic at times as they pursue their careers of helping others when they're still not certain how to help themselves in this new era of 1953. The cinematography is excellent. The plots are filled with likable characters and it doesn't hurt that the vicar, played by James Norton, appears to be a cross of early JFK and Robert Redford.. an extra incentive for the ladies in the audience, I think this series will be just what a lot of people are looking for!",1482624000,,1008,4.832369942196531

The main character does not represent a man of religion and certainly does not take action and the view points that a real one would; he's only dressed and titled as one. Probably an underlying Hollywood (and whatever they call it it in the UK and elsewhere) scheme to try to degrade morale and correctness, as they do. I'm glad for the reviews with low ratings that do not overlook these things and do warn against them. It's good to see some humanity and dignity left in people.

6895149,4,B00R041FXA,"British detective drama, set in the post WWII circa 1950s Cambridgeshire village of Grantchester, near Cambridge. Features a former WWII Hero who is now an Anglican Vicar, with occasional PDSD flashbacks. He develops a sideline in solving murders with a local homicide Detective Inspector, who is also a WWII veteran with a wife and several children. The series is based on The Grantchester Mysteries, collections of short stories written by James Runcie. The first series was based on the six stories from the first book, Sidney Chambers and the Shadow of Death. A second series was commissioned in late 2014 and broadcast in March and April 2016 and a third series will air in 2017. I'd like the series better if it didn't get side-tracked in the Vicar's attempts at a love life, first with a girl from his pre-war college days and then with a German woman, and then again with his girl from college, after she's married no-less.  I'm also not wild about his junior Vicar in training, who is gay, and flirting with gay relationships during an era when being gay in England would get you thrown in jail and chemically castrated. The producers need to get the Vicar trained to fight like a WWII Kings Guard, rather than a pushing pansy. Fascinating murder-mystery story lines!",1482192000,2,1276,4.82648401826484

6895216,5,B00R041FXA,"It's nice to see a series that sort of presents Christians in a positive light -- at least it's free of most stereotypes. My favorite character is the gay young priest, Leonard Finch, played brilliantly by Al Weaver. He's completely endearing. From a Biblical and Christian standpoint, he is the genuine Christian. He knows he is a sinner, and he is struggling against his particular sin -- like all Christians should. He exhibits more of the Christian virtues than his worldly vicar, and I'm worried that, eventually, the series will allow the vicar to corrupt the values of his young charge. Weaver fully embodies his character and brings him to life. Every actor in the series does that. I am a little weary of the unrequited love hammer. It's like getting hit over the head by Maxwell in every episode. My second favorite character is Robson Green's hard-boiled detective, Geordie Keating. That guy's got an understated magnetism that really draws in an audience. Really impressed by this cast and charming English village. Agatha Christie and Jane Austen gave me a lifelong love of such things. However, is there no end of angst in an English village?",1482105600,6,1156,4.903061224489796

She loves the vicar but the relationship is totally star crossed.  Another woman, the widow of a philandering salesman, also loves the vicar and the vicar had a one night stand with a jazz singer.  The vicar's  assistant is apparently gay at time when gays were imprisoned.  There are flashbacks to the vicar's role in WWII, which apparently resulted in his becoming a vicar.  And despite of all of his personal problems, the vicar finds time to solve murders with a police inspector who has nearly as many personal problems as the vicar.

I've followed Robson Green for years. His role as Geordie is a bit of a change for him but he seems very comfortable in the part. James Norton brings the term ""dishy vicar"" (you have to watch Keeping Up Appearances) to a whole new level. He's perfect in this series.
  There are so many good characters in this series and we see them change over time. I'm happy to see that there is a series 3 on the horizon!",1481587200,,560,4.166666666666667

6895784,4,B00R041FXA,"I love James Norton in the role of Sydney Chambers. I do think that PBS sometimes goes out of it way to make the character go directly to the  left of what the church would do or believe during that period, to over emphasis a or statements that have iron clad validity in the 21st century. It makes me sad that I am finishing, season one and you have already made Sydney a womanizer, semi-efeminent, drunkard,. You've sort of Americanized it.  I love the tensions of the relationship between he and Amanda. I love Dickins should see more of him. Leonard's conflicted role is refreshing, him choosing to follow the church in its teaching over his desire. The help that he has been to the parish. I have enjoyed most of the storyline although some of it a bit ().  The costumes are very nice for the period. I will try out season two
 Hopefully Sydney has some sense of who he is and what he wants and stops accidentally backing into obscure sex and booze. Not a good look on a priest l. Will read the books, love the music too.",1481500800,2,1026,4.328125

society and the English church during the post-war era. Great character development.
Although the story can be a bit of a stretch logically-clues comeintuitively to Father Sydney in the oddest moments- the human dramas are real and believable.
As a Christian, I keep waiting for some acknowledgement of the saving power of Jesus, especially in some of the daunting dilemmas which are endured, but so far, that has not entered the scheme of things, even in the sermons.  The human community does it all, and they form their
own moral conclusions aside from any supernatural influence.  In this, the declining English church of the period is perfectly reflected.",1481414400,,779,4.923664122137405

6896060,5,B00R041FXA,Well acted crime drama with James Norton as the bachelor priest trying to balance his role as vicar with his interest in helping his friend Geordie solve crimes. Well produced. Very scenic. The plots are intricate and the characters compelling. I've watched all three seasons twice and it holds up well on the second viewing. More action-packed than many Midsomer Mysteries.,1481155200,,374,5.147540983606557
6896061,5,B00R041FXA,James Norton & Robson Green are great together.  Have been a long time fan of Robson Green and love everything he's in.  Really an enjoyable show and am looking forward to their Christmas special and Season 3.,1481155200,,209,4.621621621621622

6896079,3,B00R041FXA,"I give the series high marks for the acting, complexity of script, character interaction, period setting and production values. 4 to 5 stars. What brings it down to three stars is (SPOILER WARNING) is the fact they do not address that the main character is seemingly going down the list of the Seven Deadly Sins and everyone just thinks he is wonderful. That is the main argument I have with the series. Why do people love him so and want him as their priest, with little objection to his negative behaviour and acting out?",1481155200,6,523,4.574468085106383

It's very well done, with excellent jobs of all of the actors involved.  The storylines are engaging, with a combination of drama and mystery, so each program has plenty of appeal.  There is plenty of social commentary along with the mystery too.

It's really one of the better series I've watched lately, and I wish that there was more available to watch.  In my opinion, it ranks up with the Inspector Morris/Morse series, as well as Sherlock.  It is far superior to the unappealing variety of series that have been offered lately and well worth devoting time to watching.

To think that I resisted watching this series, simply because James Norton terrified me so much as Tommy Lee Royce in Happy Valley! This is a testament to what a truly fantastic actor he is, that he can play a damaged, manipulative, violent character with convincing ease, then turn around and convince us that he IS Sidney Chambers, the equally complicated but entirely lovable vicar. All of the actors in this series are wonderful. I have grown to love Robson Green, Al Weaver, and Tessa Peake-Jones as well.

6896168,4,B00R041FXA,"Not bad, although there are quite a few other series from the UK with the post-WW2 theme that are great including Miss Marple, Foyle's War.
 I think some of the social attitudes displayed in this particular series were probably not accurate for that time period, but I highly doubt that alcoholism, adultery, out-of-wedlock pregnancy and homosexuality didn't exist back in the 50s. If you are a conservative politically, stay away from this show, as it will make your head explode. BBC/ITV shows seem to be way more ""socially liberal"" than acceptable US fare, whereas US crime shows show explicit rape and violent murder scenes. I prefer the UK mysteries, since they don't tend to show graphic violence in a pornographic ""American"" way.

6896279,5,B00R041FXA,"Cambridge - and the nearby village of Grantchester - gets its shot at dealing with crime, though the crimes are local, family oriented.  Sidney Chambers (James Norton), probably the world's handsomest vicar, has empathy and intuition to offer hard-bitten inspector Geordie (Robson Green), but wins him over, though the tension between the two views (police & humanitarian) erupts now and then.  There's a crime per episode, as usual, but also a longer arc over the whole series (and the next one, the even better season 2) in which the fallible and very human vicar (and his complicated love life) wins you over completely.",1478736000,,623,5.038834951456311

Here the murder investigations seem to take second billing to the multi-layered perspectives of life's challenges faced by the characters. The priest (Sidney) played by Norton, reflects the complicated and often conflicting, emotional responses to the events that are woven into his parish and personal life. When confronted with humiliation, criticism and personal attacks, we see the human side of Sidney as he struggles to balance personal emotions versus God's commandments.

Even though Sidney is good-looking, he has relationship issues because he doesn't see himself that way. The stories are well done and you see him work through the case. The other characters are well developed too. The relationship that develops between Geordie and Sidney is real and you can see how much they depend on each other. Again, it shows the quality of the show showing a deep friendship between two men which is rare to see on today's tv. Lastly, you can also see the deep love between Sidney and Amanda.

6896527,5,B00R041FXA,"Grantchester is a great show on so many levels.  The characters are interesting and the relationships are well-developed.  I love the romantic aspect, but it is the deep friendship between the Vicar and the Detective that really anchors the show.  The acting is incredible, the weekly crime mysteries are interesting, the romantic storyline is compelling, and I especially love the ongoing study of mercy versus justice.

6896533,5,B00R041FXA,"Love this PBS series. James Norton makes a great Sydney Chambers.  And Robson Green is always fabulous as a copper.  Life is never easy, people have internal struggles no matter the vocation and these characters show a multi-faceted side.  Set in post WWII early 50s, you see the black and white mentalities and the gray-area viewpoints. The sets and clothes are wonderful and bring back that era.  And, of course, there's MURDER for the vicar and the cop to solve, as well as keep their personal lives on track!!!  Can't wait for Season 3.",1476748800,3,540,4.702127659574468

It's because many people find it unpleasant to watch.  Perhaps the producers thought this would cure them of their ""phobias"". It came across as jarring, like a singer who's doing fine then suddenly hits a very sour note.",1476662400,14,386,4.833333333333333

How about a smoking, drinking lovelorn vicar with a mildly surly policeman to make a team.  Good characters, good (though slightly off beat) story lines make for a good viewing experience.  I only have one slight reservation.  I have finished season one and am ready to start season two.  I see no evidence of a season three.  But I sure hope there will be one.",1476403200,,489,4.25

6896739,3,B00R041FXA,"This is an interesting series, hard to express exactly how I feel about it.  It is similar to the Father Brown series, which I really enjoyed, but much more serious and thoughtful. The acting, the scenery, the location are all very well done. However, as a deeply religious person I'm inclined to always look for the good and positive in the world and to try to make it a better place.  I try to be a little better today than I was yesterday.  I appreciate the many challenges Sidney goes through but am disappointed when he makes poor choices.  Sure, I know the character is human and makes mistakes - so do we all.  The disappointment comes when the writer seems to deliberately portray the vicar as, well, too human.  The smoking, excessive drinking, and the occasional fornication, bring him below what would be considered a life devoted to the ministry of Jesus Christ.  I suppose others reading this would say this is exactly why the series appeals to them.  I, on the other hand, had hoped the vicar would prove to be stronger, more elevated, inspiring.  There is precious little of that in the media these days.  I should know better than to look to PBS for for inspiration, but then I am an optimist at heart.",1475539200,16,1218,4.545871559633028

The Cambridge area scenery, the costuming of the characters, and the underwear model good looks of the leading character are all reasons to treat yourself.  There is a wonderful balance in the story writing where you can watch one  as a stand alone episode, but also there is a bare thread of serialization to keep you coming back for more.  The quirky relationship between Sidney and his friend Geordie grows more realistically complex with each episode.  These are multi-faceted characters, which is rare in the English mystery genre.  Viewers will walk away feeling that the time spent on this program is not time wasted.",1475193600,,678,4.9035087719298245

6896861,5,B00R041FXA,I really enjoyed this show. It pairs a hard boiled detective with a vicar with an interest in solving crimes. They seem to work well together so it was fun to watch. The vicar has insights which seem to come to him out of the blue but are grounded in his life events. For example perhaps a saying or thought comes to him which translates to the current crime at hand. Each story is interesting and the scenery often quite beautiful. For the young vicar there are two love interests and for the detective a buddy in the vicar who only wishes him well. Nothing dark and ominous here so far. Well acted enough for me to give it 5 stars so clearly well worth watching.,1474588800,,664,4.277777777777778

Mid-century modern style is blended with some very old-fashioned ideology, maintaining the integrity of the show while also keep one fully focused.  The lead actor is charming, sometimes very modern, then oddly grappling with his own beliefs and identity.  The program depicts a unique time in British history (in my opinion) where many traditions were tossed out of the proverbial window.

8693481,2,B00R041FXA,"I watched the first two seasons and just had to stop, unfortunately.  I want to rate it 5 stars and watch S3, but I'm done.  This series had the potential to be an excellent show and has first rate acting and interesting mysteries.  However, for a series about a man of God, it is frustrating and disappointing.  While no one is perfect, a minister must have high standards and be an example to others.  Sydney showed concern and love for others but his own life is a disaster.  He constantly struggles with substance abuse, drinking too much, smoking, and making poor decisions with women.  He self-medicates instead of looking to God and the Bible for strength, wisdom, and peace.  Seriously!!?  Some minister of God.  Sydney is not genuine.  He is a phony man of God.  Geordie is more genuine, because although he has problems also, he is true to his nature and not a hypocrite.  I like Sydney and Amanda and the other characters, but I couldn't take it anymore,  along with the constant profaning of the Lord's name.",1533859200,,1020,4.625698324022347
