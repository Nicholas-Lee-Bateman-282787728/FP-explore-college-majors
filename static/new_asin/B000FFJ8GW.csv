2562582,5,B000FFJ8GW,This series is a blend of a realistic 6th century England and the legend of King Arthur and Prince Valiant with Camelot and the Knights of the Round table.  The adventure begins with Prince Valaint as a squire in King Arthurs court.  The animation is excellent.,1160784000,2,261,4.6521739130434785
2562583,5,B000FFJ8GW,"This is a GREAT SHOW with GREAT PLOTS that are interesting and well written for an animated series that was done 15 YEARS ago. The picture quality and sound are pretty good they are not perfect but pretty good. The Menus are nicely done, overall this is a very nice set , you really can't beat it for the PRICE. The show itself is done very well with GREAT PLOTS and ADVENTURES, King Arthur, Merlin, Valiant, Arn and Rowanne are all great characters. Once you start watching you won't be able to stop, this show has you addicted from the very start. I was very pleased with this set, they also put a nice booklet in the set that lists every episode with a brief description and picture of each episode, again nicely done. This set is a must buy and I am looking forward for the 2nd volume to complete this GREAT SERIES!!!!!!!!!!",1152921600,17,828,4.383116883116883
2562584,5,B000FFJ8GW,"Cover Art: **** (4 Out Of 5)

The Cover Art Features A Posterised Version Of Valiant On Caliburn. It's Nice, But I Would Have Liked More Of The Cast On It. Rowanne And Arn Should Have Been Added. Merlin And King Arthur Could Have Also Used A Space. The Side View Of The Box Is Really Quality. At The Top There Is A Shield Bearing Thule's Crest, With A Volume 1 Text Over It. When Volume 2 Is Released, They Should Look Snappy Together! The Set Will Look Great On Display In Any Bookshelf, Or DVD Cabinet.

Video Quality: ***** (5 Out Of 5)

The Transfer Is Amazingly Sharp. Colors Are Bright, Filled With Luscious Color, Bringing Out The Detail, And Beauty Of The Animation (Which Surprising Still Holds Up Today, For Being Over 15 Years Old!)

Audio Quality: ***** (5 Out Of 5)

The Audio Is Tremendously Clear. Even If You Don't Have A Home Theater With Surround Sound, You Will Still Feel Every Sound Effect, Music Note, Or Piece Of Dialog. I Found Myself Turning The Sound Down...... It's That Loud!

Bonus Features: *** (3 Out Of 5)

The Special Features Are Rushed, And Not Very Much Information Is Given. A Casual Fan Will Be Satisfied, But Die-Hard Fans Can Expect Disappointment. There Are Three Interviews Included: David Corbett (Creator/Producer) , Brooks Wachtel (Writer), And Rick Norwood (Historian). Rick Norwood Is Dull, And David Corbett Doesn't Say Much. Brooks Wachtel Is The Best, And He Reveals A Few Fun Stories That Went On Behind The Scenes. Much To My Relief, Noelle North (Rowanne) Takes The Place Of Rick On The Episode Commentaries, Joining Brooks And David, Along With Andy.

The Commentaries Are All Over The Place With Subjects, And For The Most Part Not Episode Specific As Listed Originally. I Would Have Liked To See Noelle Do An Interview, Because We Only Get To Hear Her Voice. Since Everyone Else Got An Interview, It Doesn't Seem Fair That We Miss Out On Seeing Her. Robby Benson (Valiant), And Michael Horton (Arn) Are Missed, And I Think If We Could Have Had Special Features Done By Robby, Michael, And Noelle Together, It Would Have Worked Better. There Are Some Art Drawings, And A Slide-show From The Flute, That Is Set To Music Of The Soundtrack. It's Fine, But If You Own The CD Of The Soundtrack, It's Nothing Worth Telling Home About.

Menu Screens: ***** (5 Out Of 5)

The Menu Screens Are Awesome! I Wasn't Expecting Animated Menus, With Music, So It Blow My Expectations Out Of The Window! Navigation Is Easy, And You Can Select An Episode From the Menus, Or Play All On The DVD.

Thoughts:

Volume 1 Is A Great Way To Experience The Legend Of Prince Valiant! The Only Downers Of The Set, Are Some Mistakes In The Episode Summaries Paper Guide, (Included With The Set), And That The Case Seems Over-Packed, (The Discs Are Hard To Pull Out). Other Than That It's Great! I Can't Wait To Buy Volume 2! Well Done BCI! Thank you For Bringing Prince Valiant To The Fans!

Overall Rating: ***** (5 Out Of 5)

I Highly Encourage Any Fan Of The Show To Buy This Set. It's Outstandingly Done, And While The Special Features Are Somewhat Lacking, The Timeless Episodes More Than Make Up For It. I'm 100% Satisfied With My Purchase.",1152057600,9,3172,4.601063829787234
2562585,5,B000FFJ8GW,"Many people may remember this excellent cartoon from the early 90's, even though it was buried on a station not known for cartoons at the time. The show follows the adventures of Prince Valiant and his dream of joining the ranks of King Arthur's knights of the round table.  The show aired for 2 seasons on the family channel based on the Hal Foster Legend of Prince Valiant newspaper strip.  The series has been split into 2 volumes with each having the low suggested retail price of $29.99.

Volume one contains the first 33 episodes of the series, including all of season 1-26 episodes and the first 7 episodes of season 2.  Bonus features include interviews with the series creaters and comic strip historians, storyboard of entire episode #32, 2 episode commentaries from the creator/producer/writer, 5 complete episode scripts, and a gallery of paintings and drawings from the show with background music.",1150588800,20,910,4.967105263157895
2562616,4,B000FFJ8GW,"I was in college at the time and trying to work at the same time, so I missed out on Prince Valiant during its first run.  I'm a casual fan of the newspaper comic so one day I decided to catch an episode on youtube since I noticed the whole show could be picked up on the cheap.  I marveled at how well liked the theme song was among youtube posters.  Since then I've watched many adventures in Vol. 1 and have found it a refreshing change from many shows on my shelf.  It reminds me of buddy adventure shows like Xena and Hercules.  The animation won't win any awards but I quite like the voice work and overall design of the show from settings to the look of the characters.  I just wish they'd had more money to take the look of the show a couple of steps up.  If it looked exactly like the covers of these volumes it would certainly be a undisputed classic among TV animated programs.  The overall feel of the show is nice since I never really feel like I'm watching something meant strictly for young people.  Families can indeed enjoy this show together.  The violence is at a minimum and never overdone.  It teaches good values and I feel good after watching an episode, just like Xena and Hercules.  I'm certainly in the target group this show was meant for, being a huge fan of adventure shows and films, so if you're in that group then pick this up right away!",1250899200,,1370,4.267441860465116
2562617,5,B000FFJ8GW,"Set in the romanticized time of King Arthur, this animated series(based on the weekly newspaper strip) tells the story of Prince Valiant and his journey to become a Knight in King Arthur's Camelot. On this journey,the life lessons learned by both Valiant and we as viewers set this series apart from the more conventional toy placement cartoons of the time.
The animation is okay for the time it aired and there's enough action involved to keep it interesting. I'm calling this a worthwhile purchase!",1227312000,2,500,4.964285714285714
2562618,5,B000FFJ8GW,Today I got my copies of both seasons of this lovely animated series.  I have loved the Prince Valiant character for more than fifty years and enjoyed this when I first saw it.  I am glad to find a quality production on DVD.,1224720000,,224,4.186046511627907

Prince Valiant's adventures start when he leaves his parents to find the kingdom of Camelot and become a knight of the round table, along the way he makes friends who wish to join him on his quest. When Valiant and his friends reach Camelot, they begin training to become knights of the round table and must help defend Camelot against anyone who wishes to harm the kingdom.

2562621,4,B000FFJ8GW,"Allow me to begin this review with a very simple actuality: After having begun at the very first He-Man box set and venturing all the way through to the most recent in my series of reviews here on Associated Content, I found myself simply enamored with the quality of work put forth through each DVD compilation from BCI. As such, when the final He-Man set came to a close, I found myself ordering up nearly all of the remaining BCI fantasy collections in effort to return to the fandom bliss this company makes a reality through each of its collections.

Enter The Legend of Prince Valiant; an animated series from the early 1990s inspired by the long-standing Hal Foster comic strip of the same name. Interestingly enough, when the show was originally created it was broadcast in a prime time slot on the Family Channel (a network not known to offer animation). As a result, many potential viewers (myself included) knew nothing of the show's existence. As much of an embarrassment as it is to admit this, my first knowledge of the program wasn't until a few weeks ago when browsing BCI's other collections on Amazon.com. I purchased both Volume One and Volume Two with absolutely no prior expectations save for an occasional glance in the Sunday paper comics many years ago. Was it a wise investment worthy of the BCI label? Read on to find out.

For those unaware, the story centers on the exploits of an unlikely trio of teenagers striving to reach the fabled Camelot. Led by young Valiant, a prince disgusted with his father's fall from glory, the remaining members of the party are the nomadic orphan Arn and brave bow-wielding daughter of a blacksmith, Rowanne. The story literally begins at the very beginning as we witness Valiant's father's castle come under siege by the evil King Cynan then follow the survivors of the onslaught as they relocate into the marshes of barbarian owned territory. The pacing is brisk and efficient, wasting no moments on unnecessary detail and the character development is absolutely wonderful. By the end of the first disc, it is nearly impossible not to find yourself immersed in the tapestry of each character's personality and ambitions.

The set itself is a bit unique, even for a company with a long roster of similar releases. The five disc set is made up of four double sided DVDs, each containing 4 episodes per side. The fifth and final disc contains the 33rd episode of the show and a whole host of bonus material as assembled and produced by the ever-enthusiastic Andy Mangles.

Before delving into the intricacies of the set itself, allow me to first focus on the material itself. To begin I was literally astonished with the animation style, which, although dated when compared to today's era of computer rendering, surpasses the detail in nearly every other animated work up until then. The backgrounds are simply spectacular, having been designed after original renaissance masterpieces. The character textures, colors, and lighting are all spot on and truly a marvel of skill considering that cells were still hand drawn and painted at the time. Also noteworthy is the fact that the cast (lead characters especially) are endlessly drawn in different clothing and hair styles which further pushes away the viewer's attention to the fact that this is a cartoon.

Then there are the stories themselves; simply masterpieces in every sense of the word. Bear in mind that this was prime time cable television programming and with that came the ability to tackle issues never even imagined in children's specific animation such as death, revenge, slavery, and hunting for nourishment. Leery parents relax, never is this done though violent imagery or adult-specific tone, rather it's more accurate to think of how Disney handles these themes in their animated motion pictures. To summarize the experience in a single word, tasteful would have to be the one. The themes are used much like those appearing in classic literature and offer up a feeling of timelessness in their presentation that will mesmerize viewers of all age groups. Also interesting is the fact that the stories are designed as stand alones for newcomers to the series but actually link together very lineally to form one massive quest. It is very refreshing to note that Hearst Entertainment, the company behind the series, didn't resort to the standard ""villain attempts to destroy hero unsuccessfully"" archetype. Rather, here we find an interweaving tapestry of characters taken directly from legend (King Arthur, Merlin, Sir Gawain) whose stories gradually deepen throughout the series.

Also present here are a voice ensemble that rivals the best of live-acted programs of the time including Beauty & The Beast's Robby Benson, James Avery (Uncle Phil from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air), the spunky Noelle North (The Smurfs, Jem, Disney's Gummi Bears), Efrem Zimbalist Jr., and old Skeletor himself (Alan Oppenheimer) as Merlin just to name a few. The actors lend an impeccable degree of realism to the experience all throughout.

That now famous attention to detail I mentioned above in BCI's works is present here as well with two full episode commentaries, interviews with the show's creators, story board gallery, slideshow of the character paintings and background work, and as always, a full color book that simply puts all other DVD slip card inserts to shame. The set is bound in a hard plastic multi-disc case with an outer cardboard sleeve loaded with excellent artwork.

The Legend of Prince Valiant has won a Humanitas Award and three Silver Angel awards honoring its excellence as an animated series with social and ethical values, stirring storylines, and sumptuous visuals, and after having enjoyed this DVD compilation, I can attest that it was with good reason. This is the type of universally appealing story telling that makes films like Braveheart, Gladiator, and King Arthur timeless classics. My only regret is that I did not discover this gem earlier.",1209945600,4,5997,5.0201005025125625
2562622,4,B000FFJ8GW,"It would be very easy to simply say that Prince valiant is a good cartoon, but in watching it now as 29 year old, it has exceeded all my memories of watching the series as a kid. Its the scripting and the storyline that puts Valiant way, way ahead of other cartoons, in fact the writing is so good I wouldn't even bother assigning a junior age-group classification - its definitely for everyone. The whole sentiment of Valiant is very universal, addressing issues that the human condition still goes through in these very times and its been a very long time in seeing an animation made for TV, that uses eclectic thought-out language and utilises a balanced perspective without there being a plain and bland idea on the concept of 'good and evil'. The whole venture is quite wholesome without being cheesy and is unafraid to break certain codes such as having characters say the words 'kill' and 'death' and also show swords penetrating bodies, arrows hitting bodies and people actually dying. Its all done with a dignified manner and its more like watching a live action television series in that respect, especially in the way the music is employed to add some eye-watering moments. My only minor gripe and it is minor, is that the animation can be a bit stagnant at times, its never unsmooth but it does appear to not be as free flowing as cartoons of that day and cartoons that came before. Overall though you can't be disappointed with this purchase.

I have both volumes...",1190592000,3,1479,4.688461538461539
2562623,5,B000FFJ8GW,My young children and I ran into this show when it originally ran and loved it so much we taped some episodes onto VHS. Those tapes were ground into the dust over ensuing years.

2562624,5,B000FFJ8GW,"What my family likes about the Prince Valiant Series is that they are fun to watch and are a good mixture of action, humor and a good story line. The animation is not Disney quality but it is as good if not better than most animated shows on tv these days. We like that there is always a moral. The voice of Prince Valiant is the voice of the Beast in Beauty and the Beast, Robbie Benson. This is especially good for boys, but my daughter loves it and is the one who asked that we buy it.

8121702,4,B000FFJ8GW,"The Legend of Prince Valiant ranks as something of a cult series from the early 1990s. Part of its obscurity comes from the fact that it ran on the Family Channel though it does not press its Christian message too much. This is, thankfully, no Super Book which tries to hammer its message home. While there are some changes from the classic Sunday paper comic strip, this is a fascinating series with strong writing, an interesting episodic plot and actual character development. In this age of binge watching, this show might have found more of an audience. The voice casting is excellent, especially Tim Curry as Gawain. The animation simply doesnt hold up well though there are far worse efforts from the same period. The DVDs are two sided and not exactly the highest quality products though, at this price, this is to be expected. While there are a few episodes and the violence is a bit over the top (even with little gore), this series holds up well and should appeal to most young viewers who enjoy fantasy or medieval stories.

8121708,4,B000FFJ8GW,"I remember getting up early every Saturday morning to watch ""The Legend of Prince Valiant,"" and I'll admit that my decision to order the DVDs was rather clouded by nostalgia. I had misty but positive memories of the show, and naturally what we all remember as being excellent in our childhood will inevitably disappoint when revisited as an adult. However, for the most part ""The Legend of Prince Valiant"" holds up pretty well as an entertaining show with strong characterization and surprisingly complex storylines.

Borrowed liberally from the Hal Foster comic strip (first started way back in the 1930s), the show is nevertheless true to its central themes of fighting the good fight, the establishment of reason, justice and order over ignorance and oppression, and the growth of its central protagonist from a boy to a man.

After his father's kingdom is defeated by enemy soldiers, Prince Valiant of Thule decides to leave his exiled family in order to seek out the city of Camelot and pursue his goal to become one of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. Joined on the way by a shy and unassuming huntsman called Arn and a feisty blacksmith's daughter called Rowanne, the three friends search for the golden city and strive toward their common goal of knighthood. On the way, Valiant and his friends often squabble with each other, make mistakes or trust the wrong people, face challenges that they don't always succeed in, and are required to either obey or reject orders depending on circumstances, obligations, and their own sense of right and wrong. Not all the decisions they face are easy ones (or if they are, then following through on those decisions can be difficult). Corruption can be found within the walls of Camelot itself, and though there are wise authority figures to be found in Merlin, King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, even they are fallible at times.

In its time the show won several awards, such as the Humanitas Award and three Silver Angel Awards for its social/ethical values. This means of course that there are several ""lessons"" to be learn in certain episodes, dealing with racism, sexism, and (of all things) child abuse. It can get a little bit preachy, but not obnoxiously so, and thankfully the ""very special episodes"" don't permeate the entire show.

This particular box set contains thirty-three episodes of the sixty-five that were made. The first twenty-six make up the first season of the show, and encompass the story-arc of Valiant striving to discover Camelot and become one of its Knights. The following seven episodes (which make up the first segment of the second season) deal with the newfound responsibilities he faces as Knight and his continual growth into manhood. The rest of the show is contained in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/second-volume/dp/B000K4X5TE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">second volume</a>, though you can also chose to invest in the complete 65 episode box-set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B003CS28V6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>.

The show is serialized, which was (and still is) unusual for an animated series, with reoccurring characters, steady development for the three leads, and very little filler. Each episode builds on the next, increasing its cast of characters and its world-building, until there is a very clear picture of Camelot, its ideals, its past and its inhabitants. Likewise, it's extremely good with keeping track of its continuity. Often characters will hark back to events of previous episodes, and the writers never forget basic characteristics of their characters (ie, Arn cannot read, Rowanne is a gifted archer, etc).

During its production, the network had requested from its writers a show that was not just for kids, but accessible to a family audience, giving them leave to explore adult themes and situations. As such, the battle scenes depicted throughout the show can be surprising to watch, as the animators were not required to shy away from showing impact, injury, and blood on-screen. When characters sustain wounds, they are depicted with bandages or crutches afterwards. When they are hit by arrows, they die. Though it's never gratuitous, dead bodies are shown and there is no censure on using words like ""death"", ""kill,"" or ""murder."" There is also a definite sense of religion at work in this world: characters are depicted praying, and often swear by God or offer a ""bless you.""

Maintaining this grounding in reality, there is very little in the way of magic or mysticism. The abilities of Merlin and Morgana are based in knowledge of potions and alchemy rather than any supernatural power, and often stories of monsters and enchantment end up having rational explanations. Though it adheres to an idealized medieval world of chivalry and courtly love, the show definitely leans more toward fact than fantasy (though don't ask me to explain why Valiant and Arn get attacked by a dinosaur in the second episode).

Has it dated? Yeah a little bit, especially in its animation. To be frank, it looks terrible by today's standards - especially compared to the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender/dp/B000FZETI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar The Last Airbender</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League/dp/B003L7DK88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League</a>&nbsp;and other contemporary shows. At one point Valiant lassos a creature with his belt, throws them both in to the water, and has his belt back on in the very next frame. Rowanne's dress can change from white and red to pale blue from shot-to-shot. Arthur and Guinevere teleport from a forest road to an open meadow. At one point someone forgets to draw in Arthur's shoulders during a close-up, making him look like a floating head. Movement is rather stilted, and sometimes characters carry on conversations with people who aren't even in the same room. In this the show is simply a product of its time, though in several ways the show was quite innovative: the characters get to wear more than one outfit, the backgrounds were always beautifully rendered, and the show was never afraid to use lengthy wordless montages.

Also noteworthy is the voice talent involved. Actors included Robby Benson as Valiant, Tim Curry as Sir Gawain, Efrem Zimbalist as King Arthur and Alan Oppenheimer as Merlin (perhaps better known as Skeletor from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/He-Man/dp/B002DQL34G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">He-Man</a>). Viewers may also recognize the voices of James Avery (Uncle Phil from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fresh-Prince-of-Bel-Air/dp/B0006N2F0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a>), Samantha Eggar (who voiced Hera in Disney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hercules/dp/B00004R99S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hercules</a>) and long-time voice actor Jeff Bennett (if it's animated, he's probably been in it). Even Tony Jay pops in for a few cameos!

The special features in this set include interviews with David Corbett (creator/co-producer) and Brook Watchel (writer) and along with Noelle North (the voice of Rowanne) they provide episode commentaries for two episodes. There is also an interview with an ""archival collections publisher"" of  the original Valiant comic strip, a storyboard for ""The Flute"", (for which it won the Humanitas Award) a conceptual art gallery, downloadable scripts in PDF format, and a full-color booklet with episode synopsis. Altogether, it's a pretty nice package.

Finally, a tip for buyers: be very, very careful when removing the discs from their casing: they are very hard to get out and after nearly snapping one in half, I quickly relocated all of them to a safer DVD holder.",1313020800,7,8021,5.72544080604534

8121710,4,B000FFJ8GW,"Words cannot begin to describe how much I love this show. Oh let me count the ways.
This is one of the few shows that I am aware of that has an actual ending! Imagine that.

It is superior in every sense of the word. Excellent story, tight continuity, in truth it is a single continuous story with little side stories which culminate in a most singular, awesome finale.
The characters are all well fleshed out and all have their own stories which really do make you care about their plight, and ultimately drive the characters and plot forward to the final climax.

Care for a little political intrigue? patricide? civil war? love triangles, betrayal, jealousy, murder and all round adventure? Then this show is for you.

The cast itself is just awesome. Normally seeing big names in a cartoon would be a sign that the budget has been blown on hiring stars rather than on what's important. I.E the story and animation. I am glad to report that this is not the case.
We've not even covered the soundtrack yet..dear lord the soundtrack. Go do a search for the opening on the internet and you'll see what I'm talking about. ""Where the Truth Lies"" from Exchange is a singular piece of music that is just as epic as the show itself.

The animation is pretty good for the most part. There were only a couple of episodes where I felt that things were noticeably off model, but considering the quality of the voice acting and the characterisation I can easily forgive it.

On to the set itself. This being a BCI release the quality of the audio and video is about as good as it could possibly get for a show of this era. The only place where this set falls down is in the physicals.
The discs themselves are double sided flipper discs, which is something that always irks me as it's so difficult to try and keep finger prints off of the suckers.

This release came out near the end of BCIs life so releases from this time tend to suffer from understandable cost cutting exercises. I can get over it though because were it not for the flipper discs design it would have taken 4 volumes to release rather than 2, and I suspect that had they went for a 4 volume release it would never have seen the light of day.

Another place where there is noticeable cheapness is in the case itself. The case is constructed of this hard, brittle plastic and my volume 1 set has actually broken in 2 places already..one of which was in transit!
The other downside to this hard plastic is that the hub that the discs secure to is SO TIGHT that you fear that you're going to snap the discs before it actually releases them, and considering that this particular release is now Out of Print and you're trying to pry out double sided discs.. you'll need to be taking your brave pills before trying to extricate the discs for viewing.

Having said that these sets come with a very nice insert that gives you a nice summary of each episode in the set, plus some really nice artwork. On that subject the set itself has some really nice cover art courtesy of the talents of MVCreations' Emiliano Santalucia & Val Staples with David Levine. Although it doesn't make the set, inserts like this are becoming few and far between so to have it included (especially in this late BCI release) is appreciated.

I would most definitely reccomend this set; but I would also urge you to decant your discs into some blank DVD cases to save from the inevitable snapping and crying that would ensue from repeated removal of the discs from that rock hard plastic hub.

There has been a re-release of both volume 1 and 2 of this from the budget releaser Milk Creek Entertainment, and as you'd expect it goes for budget prices.
If you consider yourself a collector I would try and get the BCI release if you can, if for no other reason than the Milk Creek release has as many episodes as possible crammed onto the discs so you know that the video quality is going to suffer. At present I don't own that set so I cannot vouch for its quality, but I plan to just purely so I can use it as watching fodder to save my more precious BCI set.

If you're more of a casual fan who just wants to see the show without much concern for extras or the superior video quality afforded by the BCI release, then you might be better going with the Milk Creek release.

4 stars. It would be 5 stars were it not for the flipper disc design and the brittle plastic trays",1292025600,,4399,4.397293972939729
8121711,4,B000FFJ8GW,"Its been about 16 years since ive seen this. I got a good deal for it too. 33 episodes, each one containing adventure that get you wanting to watch one episode after another.
  My only 2 complaints are one, the DVDs are sort of tough pull out of the festeners w/out possible snappage of the disc. And two, the DVD collector's case itself. I don't want to sound too petty, but the way the DVDs are racked up seem to be so tight together. The DVDs being 2-sided. Therefore dvd # 3 and 4 are due to an unavoidable scratch due to constant touching from the hinged DVD case rack of # 1 and 2 everytime you open the case. Some times you may notice how they cling themselvs to the rack when opening. (Definate scrtch there). If you get this collection, (don't get me wrong, it's worth every penny.) see about using a seperate CD case to contain these DVDs. Not urgent, just a suggestion.
  I LOVE the barley noticeable ""The Family Channel"" logo after the credits of each episode. YEP IT'S THERE. ya gata look. LOL. Its about the only show production logo you'll see.
  Those who don't know, that was the network before it was FOX family now turned to ABC family. A little history lesson to fellow retro-junkies.",1253404800,2,1204,4.400900900900901
