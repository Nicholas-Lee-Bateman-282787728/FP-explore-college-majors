8688908,3,B00PNUR5PK,"Previously there was a release under the Top Gear banner with Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson entitled The Perfect Road Trip. Now the premise was that these two now stupidly wealthy chaps would drive about in cars most of us will never see in real life much less be able to buy and in aforesaid dream cars make their way about Italy.

For whatever reason the Top Gear machine decided that what we needed was a second dose of the exact same. Now for those familiar with Top Gear (and if you are reading this review that's a fair bit) you'll know the personalities of the two presenters. And trust me there is not a single deviation from their assigned roles in this show. Once again a range of incredibly interesting and bollock achingly expensive cars are tag team driven across Italy with a variety of challenges thrown in for good measure.

For car nuts there is a lot to like here but the chit chat is phoned in, the arguments between the presenters boring and the challenges not terribly interesting more often than not. Some of the Italian vistas are pretty and there are some charming old towns on view as well. Towards the end the chaps swap their cars for boats to head to the Isle of Capri where they pick up their last cars for the journey - a pair of Ford Capri street machines.

And that's about it really. If you have a shelf full of Top Gear DVD's you'll probably buy this one anyway but it is one of the lesser lights of the franchise.",1438905600,,1454,4.377777777777778

8688910,3,B00PNUR5PK,"This Blu-ray was supposed to work on US Blu-ray players. It worked fine on one of our Blu-ray players, but unfortunately NOT the Blu-ray hooked up to our big screen TV. Had some troubles on a PC with a Blu-ray capable drive, too. There is something funny about the format on this Blu-ray that makes it not work on any US Blu-ray player. (Yes -- even when the Blu-ray drives have the latest software update from the mfg.)",1420588800,,420,4.397435897435898

8688912,1,B00PNUR5PK,"After waiting for 2 weeks I put the DVD in the player but it would only show a 2entertain ad but NOTHING else, it would just go to the menu of my DVD player and when i would select the video again the whole thing would just start over, tried several times, no luck. When i tried the DVD player with another DVD it worked fine so it is a undeniably a DVD disk fault. A HUGE disappointment especially since i had been waiting for nearly a month to see the video. Amazon, I DEMAND a new, free DVD sent to me for this disgusting disappointment I paid $40 for and spent two weeks waiting.",1417564800,,583,4.078260869565217
