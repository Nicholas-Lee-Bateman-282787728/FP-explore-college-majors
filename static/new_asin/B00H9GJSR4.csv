6142408,4,B00H9GJSR4,"Festival Express documents a 1970 tour across Canada of some special people.  The concept was to have a festival concert with a lot of the big name bands of the time, but instead of having the people come to the concert, the organizers thought they would hire a train and move the festival across Canada.  The DVD features a lot of Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin as the featured performers, but the Band are featured in more than one song.  The story revolves around what happens at the first show, and the aftermath from the concerts from then on.  I won't spoil the story and what happens, but the on train footage of the bands mixing together is priceless.",1395187200,11,659,4.512605042016807
6142409,1,B00H9GJSR4,"Although Amazon lists this blu-ray as 'all regions' it's 'A' region only, so it doesn't play on my BD-player here in Europe. It's marked on the backside so no excuse for the wrong information.",1394409600,,192,4.676470588235294
6142410,5,B00H9GJSR4,"After reading the only other review I wanted to set the record straight.  As far as I'm concerned, in 5 days of filming the filmmakers came up with 90 minutes of some of the best footage in rock history.  Normally I prefer music over interviews and background footage but, watching all the antics that went on during the train rides never gets old. In addition to that 90 minutes of greatness there is plenty of bonus footage.  I could sit here and mention scene after scene but I will settle with one: Rick Danko half in the bag singing ""Ain't No More Cane on the Brazos"" with Janis and Jerry and everybody else.  The look on his face and his body language crack me up every time.  It's a raw, inside look at the way these people let loose as well as some stellar performances.  Festival Express should be on every music fans shelf.  Even if you've seen it, get it and leave around for your kids or younger siblings to find and help keep this music alive.",1393459200,18,956,4.337078651685394
6142411,3,B00H9GJSR4,"Five days of filming, all this work they allegedly did to restore the material, and they can only come up with a 90-minute Blu-Ray?  No thanks.",1392249600,,143,4.5

6142413,3,B00H9GJSR4,"What could be a more fun journey than this?  To ride on a train across Canada, stopping here and there to give concerts and then it's back on the train with your peers and friends in the music business, Wow, such a great time.
This movie contains a few good performances. period.
If only there had been some imaginative camera work, some decent editing, something, anything to show us this trip in a way that wasn't so boring.  I love all the musicians in this flick, well, most of them, anyway, but there was nothing here to endear them to me.  I already was crazy for them before I saw this and that was a good thing, because I was left feeling , well,...meh*
My assumption was this would be a GREAT movie, because look at who's in it!  All my faves!!!
This movie is proof that cast alone does not an epic film make.",1480636800,,818,4.258064516129032

8631187,5,B00H9GJSR4,"With some critics claiming this epic festival footage on both the artists playing and partying on the train that toured Much of Canadas major cities, in my opinion its all around fascinating and exciting too see all my favorite bands (Grateful Dead along with Janis Joplin as the highlights, its rare footage of epic musicians jamming together and putting on fabulous concerts. I personally was so happy after my first watch of this flick, seeing so many artists mingle, party and play is in itself a true relic. Lots of other amazing things happened that aren't featured in the film itself, but look up some of the epic stories associated with this journey - so watch then look up some of the stories that took place not actually shown in the flick. These were epic times and this video just goes to show how amazing each musician on this train truly is/was.",1523318400,,859,4.657894736842105
