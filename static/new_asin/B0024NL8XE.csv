8350743,3,B0024NL8XE,"First let's get this much straight: this is not an independent film or television adaptation of Ibsen's classic.  It is a video shot in what was probably the film maker's own house, or a neighbor's, with a cast made up mostly of local community theater players, most likely using an amateur digital camera.  It is contemporized, probably to avoid the necessity for period costumes or sets.  The film making is, for the most part marginally competent, but that's about it.

The video gets off to a terribly slow start.  There is a completely unnecessary intro consisting of exterior shots of an affluent suburb (ostensibly to tell you that its setting is contemporary, I suppose) followed by an equally unnecessary monologue delivered by an actor using a bad German dialect on Ibsen and his play.  Then there are seemingly endless lingering establishment and transitional shots which do not advance the plot, but seem designed to show off the film maker's underwhelming prowess.

Once the story gets going though, the pace picks up, and there is a reasonably competent telling of Ibsen's story.  Still this video could stand to lose about fifteen of its first thirty minutes.

The supporting cast is uneven, and the older actors tend to do better than the younger.  Also the women tend to do better than the men.  The original musical score is often too bright and bouncy for the heavy subject matter.  The screenplay is faithful to Ibsen's play, more or less, but there are some ill conceived attempts at humor--most egregiously Eilert Lovborg taking a leak against a tree in Judge Brack's back yard.

So what is there to recommend this video?  One riveting performance by Jeanne Lynn Gray.  There is a spectrum in the interpretation of Hedda's character from vulnerable and sympathetic on the one extreme (exemplified by Fiona Shaw) to shaded and complex (exemplified by Glenda Jackson) to dark, manipulative and downright villainous.  Ms. Gray goes for this last...and nails it.  Hers is a cold, controlling and vindictive Hedda.  An altogether chilling performance.

Keep your finger on the FF through the beginning, and try to be patient with the amateur supporting cast, if you think you can put up with all this video's faults and flaws, but Ms. Gray's performance is outstanding.  And the only reason to watch this.",1372982400,,2322,4.966321243523316
8350744,1,B0024NL8XE,"I felt swindled paying $1.99 to rent this video !!!
Ibsen's Hedda Gabbler is classic.
This production is the equivalent of a 2nd-rate high-school play.
I watched, hoping it would improve, but no miracle occurred.
The acting, directing, casting, production ALL were horrible.
And the music ???!!!.....a mix of 70's porn & a cheap travel-promotion video.
Honestly...I have never been so disappointed !!!",1358294400,3,401,5.380952380952381
8350745,1,B0024NL8XE,"Porno movies from the sixties have more production values, kindergarten plays display more thespian skill, and interpretation of original work would be more accurate if performed by intellectually challenged rhesus moneys. Unworthy of even a viewer with kitsch in mind or on serious hallucinagens.",1341100800,4,297,5.7727272727272725

8350747,1,B0024NL8XE,"Do not buy this video. I have seen amateur class movie projects done more professionally than this film. In addition, the director's interpretation misses the point of the play entirely. Ibsen himself would give it a thumbs down!",1288224000,7,229,5.052631578947368
