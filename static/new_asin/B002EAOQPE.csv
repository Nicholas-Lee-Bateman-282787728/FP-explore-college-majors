8367012,5,B002EAOQPE,"First of all, I beg anyone who could possibly be reading this, ignore all the 1-star reviews that litter the Memphis collection on Amazon. They represent one very tenacious, very strange individual (strange enough to go to every single Memphis disc available, and place the same odd 2-sentence review).

  If you're a fan of pro wrestling at it's most entertaining, these discs are for you. You'll see where Paul Heyman got many of his ideas for ECW in this stellar collection; even the notoriously self-centered Heyman will freely admit it! Before the term 'sports entertainment' replaced 'pro wrestling', the incredible, often hilarious, but never insulting angles and programs presented on Memphis wrestling throughout the 70's and 80's truly define that overused McMahon-ism.

  TIP: Begin with what i feel is still the best-booked, and best performed, feud in modern wrestling history: Jerry Lawler vs Tommy Rich and Austin Idol. Words cannot do this classic justice.",1302307200,4,972,5.279220779220779
8367013,1,B002EAOQPE,These are the discs that are possibly in a lawsuit?? They aren't worth the high price I paid for them!! Waiting all these years for Classic Memphis footage and this is what I get? My husband's VHS tapes look better than this. Sad. I already had most of it in much better quality from a site called 70s-tv.,1287273600,,305,4.275862068965517
