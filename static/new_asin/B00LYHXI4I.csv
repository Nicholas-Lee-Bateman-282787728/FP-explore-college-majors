Michael (Neeson) is a famous author who is living in Paris in order to write his latest novel. He left his wife behind and is visited often by his mistress who want to be a writer herself. Julia (Kunis) is an ex-actress who is involved in a custody battle for her young son but is having personal problems of her own. Scott is an American businessman living in Italy looking for ideas when he meets a strange woman and decides to help her with her problems. The three different couples are all experiencing the same thing. Dealing with loss and trying to find forgiveness. I was pretty excited about watching this one. Crash is one of the best movies I have seen and this is from the same writer and director.  I think that is what hurt the movie a little though. I went in expecting a movie similar to Crash and while this was good it was not as good as Crash. The biggest problem with this one is that Crash kept you guessing and wondering how each story will be intertwined with the others. I had a feeling how this one would end pretty early and I was right. I'm not saying that a bad thing but I have come to expect a little more from Paul Haggis. On the other hand though that is really the only bad thing I can say about this. The acting is great and the writing is still very good and I love movies like this, many different story lines that end up intersecting with each other. The movie is a little slow at times but I didn't find it all that hard to stay interested in and I am very glad I watched this. This really isn't a movie you can talk about a whole lot without giving anything away but I will say that I did like this quite a bit and I recommend this. Overall, another very intelligent movie that is very much worth seeing but not as good as Paul Haggis' other movies. I give it a B.",1411862400,10,1893,4.1580381471389645
6516312,4,B00LYHXI4I,"The film opens with six or seven short subplots that come together but don't. This is a film one would expect from an indie director with an unknown cast. The film centers on Michael (Liam Neeson) a Pulitzer winner with severe writer's block due to the death of his son. He lives in a Hotel in Paris and it appears much of the film is actually his writings which is cause for much confusion. For instance when he leaves the hotel with his mistress Anna (Olivia Wilde) they are in Paris. When Julia, (Mila Kunis) the maid leaves the hotel, she is in New York (note 212 area code on building). Julia is having trouble getting her life together following the near death of her son as she struggles with social services and her husband for visitation rights.

There is also a weird scene going on in Rome where Scott (Adrien Brody) is stealing designs and meets a woman who needs help.

We don't know what motivates the characters until the end when it comes together.

Michael keeps a journal where he talks about himself in the third person. There is a third person in all the characters' lives and that is a child.

I believe the film is the disjointed writing of a grieving author searching for a topic. For most people, this film will be two plus hours of torture. For those who love films with an indie flare that forces the viewer to get engaged with the art, this one is for you.

6516313,3,B00LYHXI4I,"With a cast boasting Liam Neeson, Mila Kunis, Olivia Wilde, as well as Adrien Brody, in starring roles, it is hard to not be intrigued what this combination would do. Though with a low box office tally, as well as a low ratings on most media review web sites, could it be this combination doesnt create a cohesive film? Read below to find out.

Characters & Story

Beginning with the central story, Michael (Liam Neeson) is a Pulitzer Prize winning author who seemingly, as of late, hasn't shown the writing abilities which lead to him deserving a Pulitzer. And while he works on his new book, somewhere in Paris, his mistress, and mentee, Anna (Olivia Wilde) visits him, on his request. Though with both of them having their own agenda when it comes to being in each others company, it is hard to say who is getting the most out of who.

As for the first side story, it deals with a man named Scott (Adrien Brody) who works in dealing fraudulent designer clothing designs who, one day while in Italy, comes across a woman in a bar named Monika (Moran Atias) who is in need. Why? Well, her daughter is being held hostage and she needs 5,000. And with Scott having a child who he hasn't seen in a long time, and Monika not being able to see her daughter in 2 years, his sympathy for her leads to him doing his best to help.

Leaving story 3 in which we watch Julia (Mila Kunis), a mother desperately trying to see her son, fighting a legal battle against her ex Rick (James Franco) who is doing everything in his power to stop her. The reason? Well, she neglected their son one time, endangered his life, and no he feels like he cant trust the two of them to be together. Leading to us watching an uphill battle in which Julia tries to prove to Rick, as well as the courts, that she deserves, at the very least, visitation rights.

Praise

To me, each story could have possibly been its own movie. Neeson and Wildes was complicated enough to be a full length picture, which I would see; Brody and Atias story could have been an action movie, a drama, if not a noir, which I probably would be labeled TV Viewing; and Kunis and Franco certainly could have had a nice dramatic film in which, maybe, Kunis could show her abilities, or lack thereof, as a dramatic actress. Which I probably wouldnt pay to see.

Noting specific reasons to praise the films story as a whole though, really only Neeson and Wilde bring anything interesting to the film. For while the concept of the older established man, and the woman who wants to be taken seriously, as well as receive validation from the man she admires, isn't new at all, something about their chemistry just works. For with the many complications in their relationship, of which for every cute moment there is an argument or one being a butt head to the other, you have a growing desire, despite it all, to see them work it out. Then, if you look at the many theories about Michaels newest book, it adds a whole new depth which helps make the non-Neeson/ Wilde stories much more compelling.

Criticism

However, if you are like me and don't connect the dots like IMDB user T-Max did, honestly you are left unsure how these stories are interconnected, besides by weakly developed relationships. Making it so, based on each story standing on its own, you have one major story, being Neesons and Wildes, compensating for Brodys and Kunis. For, you see, focusing first on Brody and Atias story, the plot just doesnt grab you in anyway. For it starts in a bar, it seems Scott is attracted to Monika, but with Monika giving him the cold shoulder he tries to win her over by talking about his kid and trying to seem like he isn't just trying to get in between her thighs. Leading to this whole, is she trying to con me, or not, plot which honestly isn't set to the type of tone where you feel it is relevant. If just because there isn't much of a build to make it seem like Monika maybe conning him, much less you giving a damn enough about Scott to care if he loses 1000s of euros because of Monika.

Then, when it comes to Kunis and Franco, quite honestly I just don't think of Mila Kunis and think, She should play a dramatic role. A thought she doesnt change at all in this film for she doesnt break the idea that she is a better comedic actress than anything else. For something about her, which may be due to me mentally type casting her, just doesnt make her attempts at being dramatic, or playing a role which requires real depth, to seem compelling nor realistic. Add in she is playing off Franco, who also I just don't see as a good dramatic actor, and it really kills what honestly was an interesting storyline. Just played by the wrong actors.

Overall: TV Viewing

If this movie was just about Michael and Annas relationship, this might have been labeled Worth Seeing. However, with the inclusion of Brody and Kunis story, the film gained liabilities which didn't create the type of interest that Michael and Anna did in terms of characters, nor the characters stories. Making it where I must label this as a TV Viewing since Brody and Kunis story felt like extra fat which should have been trimmed off.",1411171200,2,5154,4.453870625662779

What finally drew me in was the amazing cast and my inclination to resist letting the opinions of others dictate my choice. In this case choosing for myself paid off. I found the movie to be interesting, strange, confusing, beautiful, frustrating, crafty, and shocking. It is a puzzle, of sorts, and trying to figure out what was happening, where, and to whom made it one of the most interesting movies I have seen in years. My friend felt the same way and we both left the theater with a feeling of giddy amazement. We have discussed the movie numerous times, and find it a frequent source of stimulation and reflection. Compared to the frequently bland cinema fare which is forgettable once one exits the theater, this movie can stick with you for a long time, and can stimulate some fun conversations with others.",1409184000,55,986,4.544943820224719
6516317,3,B00LYHXI4I,"""Third Person"" (2013 release; 127 ,in.) brings three separate but somehow interwoven stories. As the movie opens, we get brief glimpses of all the main characters. Eventually the three following story lines emerge: Michael (played by Liam Neeson) is a former Pullitzer Price winning writer who is now struggling big time to write his next book. He is holed up in a hotel in Paris, where he is visited by his (much younger) girlfriend Anna (played by Olivia Wilde), herself hoping to become a big name writer. In the second story, Sean (played by Adrien Brody) is an American business man in Rome where by chance (?) he makes the acquaintance of a Roma woman who is desperately trying to get her 8 yr. old daughter back in Romania to join her in Italy. In the third story, Julia (played by Mila Kunis) is a young divorced woman, down on her luck, and desperately trying to get visitation rights to see her young son, while dealing also with her ex (played by James Franco). To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest project from respected writer-director Paul Haggis, the multiple Oscar-winner (as writer-director of ""Crash"" and as writer of ""Million Dollar Baby""). Second, it takes a long time to understand what is really going on, and in general I don't mind a long jelling process at all in movies that are well written and thought out. Unfortunately, here the wait does not pay off. The movie feels adrift and without a clear sense of aim. Not to mention that there are plot points that simply don't make sense or feel entirely unbelievable (sorry that I can't list examples but I don't want to post spoilers). Third, this is a very international tinted movie, shot on location in New York, Paris, Rome, Antwerp (Belgium) and Taranta (Italy). Fourth, the all-star cast tries to do its very best with the material that they were given--Olivia Wilde and James Franco shine in particular, but you can do only so much with subpar writing. Last but not least, there is a great orchestral score for the movie, composed by Dario Marianelli. Bottom line: when Moby's ""The Only Thing"" starts blasting over the end titles, it felt like a relief, frankly. It's finally over!

The movie showed up the weekend before last on two screens in all of Greater Cincinnati. The late matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay for a weekday matinee. When late into the movie one of the movie's big ""secrets""is revealed, a collective gasp was audible (and also the comment ""you gotta be kidding me!""). I really wished the movie was better than it turned out. I guess there is a reason that this it currently only has a 22% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I encourage you to make up your own mind about this movie, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, but don't say you weren't warned... Viewer beware!",1405900800,21,2937,4.657032755298651

6516369,5,B00LYHXI4I,"The basic plot of this movie is very well-hidden .... if you don't get it (as most critics did not, and I did not) its as if the movie makes no sense, the director wasn't able to make a good plot ending.  But if you do get it, as my spouse did - and we
confirmed by googling 'spoiler alert' , it is a perfectly constructed plot, and everything falls into place.
True, the movie is dark - in fact, it is a tragedy.  So to help fans of the actors - who all were fantastic - and for people whocan handle tragedy, and want to see a really well-photographed picture, here is the SPOILER ALERTreal simple - except for the opening and closing scenes, showing Liam Neeson at his writing desk - everything in the movie, including the young woman's visit to Neeson - is in his head and in his typescript for the novel he is working on.  His own son died in a pool accident because Neeson was not watching him for a minute but taking  a cellphone call from his mistress.
All the subplots of the movie are Neeson's mind trying to come to terms with this tragedy - and his own responsibility - by making variations on the theme of parents losing, loving, or destroying children.
Once I understood this I immediately saw the movie again - truly wonderful.  Tragedy can be wonderful and mind-illuminating - Aeschylus, Shakespeare, etc.",1510617600,,1320,4.39344262295082

For a film with an impressive ensemble cast (Neeson, Olivia Wilde, Kim Basinger, Mila Kunis, James Franco, Adrian Brody), this movie is fairly obscure.  Disclosure:  the main reason I picked it up was the fact that it stars Olivia Wilde.  I'm Wilde about Olivia, and she's as adorable as ever!  Spoiler alert:  there is a scene in which she runs through a hotel stark naked that is one of the ALL TIME classic scenes in cinema history.  For that reason, this DVD is a MUST for Olivia's fans.

There is within this Paul Haggis film, however, story lines of secrets that bind tortured people, most of them strangers to each other, together. It is long and detailed, and the three main story threads also expand into other threads, connected but ephemeral.

If this were music it would be like a classic romantic full-orchestra symphony by Mahler, with specific movements and motif tones and timing; all eventually joining from a grand theme into a rich, rewarding finale. An interesting motif is the thinking of the Liam Neeson character who is struggling with his own honesty and ability to write creatively. Through his mind is the effect of imagination on the power of the written word and how it applies to himself. At one point I was wondering whether the other story threads were out of his imagination also, but then, this is the magic of this provocative film by Paul Haggis (Crash, In the Valley of Elah).

Most know the actors in this film, but I would like to point out a few largely unknown: Maria Bello and Moran Atias. Bello mostly has been in TV shows and films as a side character actor, and her presence lends an integrity and earthiness that counters Neeson's powerful presence. Atias, recently seen in the new TV series Tyrant, has a timeless strength and physical beauty that glues her to the screen before she even utters a word. Even notorious Kim Bassinger re-emerges here and is powerful and compelling. All in this film are perfectly cast, and they obviously revel and respect Haggis' direction and story. One can always tell this when a well-known performer becomes someone else other than who we think they are, not merely an actor portraying a name in a story.

A story of emerging into who and what one is in spite of difficult or troubled histories, this is one not to be missed.",1430956800,,2102,4.785123966942149

6516486,4,B00LYHXI4I,"Just by coincidence, the movie I saw before this one, ""The Burning Plain,"" also employed a fractured narrative technique and also featured Kim Basinger.  In that movie, the fracturing enabled the director to intercut two stories from different time frames, and it wasn't at all difficult to follow and to see the relation between the two stories.  Paul Haggis's ""Third Person"" is a knottier proposition.  Here there seem to be three stories, each set in a different city (New York, Paris, Rome), and the relations between them remain cloudy for much longer -- in fact, even at the end, there were things I wasn't totally sure about.  For all that, it is well worth seeing, I think.  At worst, you could say the movie was ""clever"" -- a term one character uses of another's writing in the movie itself, and he doesn't mean it as a compliment -- and at best you might think it quite moving and genuinely exploratory, especially about certain kinds of artistic difficulties.  There's no doubt, though, that Haggis means to confuse and puzzle the audience to some extent, and part of the pleasure of the movie is in trying to solve the puzzle.  With that in mind, a reviewer should resist the temptation to go into much detail, because it would be too easy to spoil a first experience of the movie, and I think it's good enough and fascinating enough to be worth your time to watch.  You might ask, what kind of puzzle is it?  I'll give one example -- in one story, a hotel cleaning woman in New York (Mila Kunis) suddenly seems to be cleaning Liam Neeson's hotel room in Paris!  What the heck . . .!!

There are fine performances from everybody.  Neeson plays a famous writer, a Pulitzer Prize winner, whose recent books have been disappointing, and he's not too happy about his current work-in-progress.  Olivia Wilde is his younger girlfriend, with her own secrets and worries.  Their story is the Paris story.  Adrien Brody is in Italy, a shady American businessman connected to the fashion industry, and he gets tangled up with a Roma woman (Moran Atias) who seems to be trying to buy her child a way out of Albania and is having trouble coming up with the money.  In New York, Kunis is the divorced wife of James Franco, and is trying to get a court to allow her visitation to her child with Franco.  Why have these rights been denied?  Her lawyer is Maria Bello, who seems to be Brody's divorced wife, while Kim Basinger, in New York, seems to be Neeson's ex-wife.  All that information gives away nothing important, and all actors are very good in their roles.

My first thought when I had seen the movie was to say, ""I should see that again!""  I haven't yet, partly because I've realized that the experience would be totally different now that I think I have some idea about how it all hangs together.  It's fascinating in a formal way -- but the issues the characters deal with beyond the formal ones are sufficiently humanly engaging to hold your attention, especially when the acting is as good as it is here.

The plot/s drew me in as I wondered how they would all come together, it wasn't until the last scenes that the viewer realizes that no one, other than the writer, was real!  No one, except for, possibly, the writer's drowned son, but, with his wife's request for him to ""come home,"" it is even doubtful that she exists since the camera obviously pans to Neeson keying away at his computer, her comment that ""...even this will make it in the story...""  Also, the times that he ""does"" converse with the wife, she intuitively asks if ""she"" (meaning the other woman) is there with him.  ""She"" (Olivia Wilde) was fictional, so, why would a real-life wife ask about a fictional woman, unless the wife was also fictional.

I think it's a shame how so much of the story was a lead-on with no point!  For instance, what on earth was the point of bringing brief attention that Wilde's character was having sex with her father?  There was no point to anything.

6516551,2,B00LYHXI4I,"Frankly I didn't know much about this movie but it has an outstanding, award winning cast and was directed and written by Paul Haggis.  Haggis is probably best known for his great screenplays and he also directed Oscar winner ""Crash.""  The promo suggests that like ""Crash"" and many other films, this one would have 3 different storylines that would somehow intersect as the film progresses.  I'll give Haggis credit for differentiating from that style here.

What this film has is 3 storylines, similar in structure but running parallel in 3 different cities (New York, Rome and Paris).  Unfortunately, in spite of some good acting, the film gets more ridiculous as the story progresses.  The Parisian story features Liam Neeson as Michael, a famous novelist, and Olivia Wilde as Anna who has joined him and is his mistress.  Kim Basinger plays the jilted wife.  The Rome adventure has Adrien Brody as Scott who steals fashion designs and sells them to counterfeiters.  He meets a local girl named Monika (Moran Atias) in a bar.  His jilted New York wife is played by Maria Bello.  She is actually an attorney for Julia (Mila Kunis), a former actress trying to get visitation rights for her young son.  Her jilted husband is played by James Franco.  Jilted may or may not be the right word here as there are somewhat understandable circumstances surrounding each conflict.  But they all have a similar cause that becomes clear in the final act.

What isn't clear is why this film seems to fall apart the more we get into it.  Everyone is either stupid, psychotic or criminal and I got tired of guessing.  No one is remotely likeable and Haggis even throws in a little incest to really challenge the gag reflex.  Even though the film looks good, the story(s) isn't.  I will note that for those who enjoy Ms. Wilde's exquisite cheek bones, you'll get to see even more cheek in this film.  Add a half star for that.

The Blu ray package is really well done.  It comes in a 1080p video resolution and has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  This is a beautiful looking disc by Sony.  Excellent clarity and detail throughout.  The colors don't shout, but are nicely restrained and pleasing to the eye.  Flesh tones are accurate and black levels are deep.  I could see no anomalies.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track compliments the video perfectly.  It too offers no bombastic sound but a restrained and very clear track.  The musical score is very good and offers a perfect accompaniment to the scenes.  The audio is very accommodating.  Extras include a commentary track with Haggis and others, a Q & A with Haggis, a ""making of"" short, a trailer and the usual trailers/previews.

6516647,3,B00LYHXI4I,"Slow moving, with some surprise twists that do not seem to fit the characters or the story plot?  Actors are known names and believable in most instances in this film.  The viewer is introduced to 3 stories, 3 sets of characters, which the screen writer attempts to bring together at the end of the film.  The basic story centers around a ""burned-out"" writer who's first book was a hit, but what he produced there after did not sell.  he is married and is having an affair, characterized by intentional cruelty and ""rough"" sex, with a much younger woman (who also has another, even older lover).  The other characters in the film are created by the writer, and each of the other stories shares elements of the writers own situation in life.  Basically, Liam Neeson (the writer) lies to everyone, so the theme or thread in the film explores the many consequences and results of lying.  The film is dark in nature, focuses on self-destructive tendencies, and offers up for your inspection the many ways we humans can destroy the real joy life has to offer.  I would call this film a ""work in progress.""  There may be a good story there, but it will take some re-work to create a worthy watch for the viewer.  I see why it did not make a ""splash"" in theaters.",1414972800,5,1256,4.517699115044247

Among her daily housekeeping responsibilities in this Manhattan property is cleaning the  posh Parisian suite in Paris, France that is occupied by a Pulitzer Prize winning author. This author is in Paris for all but the last three minutes of the film.  Question: how does she travel between NY and Paris to clean the suite? Is there a space /time warp we are not aware of that instantly transports her between the two cities?  Or Is that just an  inexcusably poor storytelling; one of several aspects of the story that is never explained. At the end of the film, one or two of the confusing strings seemed to have been resolved. However others were left hanging when suddenly the credits began to roll.  This film had the potential for greatness with its fine cast and the concepts behind each story. Maybe the writer just overreached.",1414195200,2,1076,4.747311827956989

He is unable to go back to his old nor forward with the new relationship. He is on a course of self flagellation. The girl friend is emotionally scarred, that is the connection between the two.

6516705,4,B00LYHXI4I,"Paul Haggis both wrote and directed this very long movie (137 minutes) that plays with our minds in a way not dissimilar to his most famous similar film CRASH. The quilted story  takes patience and close attention to paste each of the three running stories together - three (at times augmented) couples whose lives are altered in some way by a child - drowning, abusive by placing in a plastic bag, a conveniently imagined child - and it all ties together with slips of paper, pages of novels, paintings and other threads spread around Paris, Rome, and New York.

.Michael (Liam Neeson) is a Pulitzer Prize-winning fiction author who has sequestered himself in a hotel suite in Paris to finish his latest book. He recently left his wife, Elaine (Kim Basinger), and is having a tempestuous affair with Anna (Olivia Wilde), an ambitious young journalist who wants to write and publish fiction. At the same time, Scott (Adrien Brody), a shady American `clothing designer' businessman, is in Italy to steal designs from fashion houses. Hating everything Italian, Scott wanders into the Caf American with barkeep Marco (Riccardo Scamarcio) in search of something familiar to eat. There, he meets Monika (Moran Atias), a beautiful Romanian woman, who is about to be reunited with her young daughter. When the money she has saved to pay her daughter's smuggler Carlo (Viinico Marchioni) has stolen, Scott feels compelled to help. They take off together for a dangerous town in Southern Italy, where Scott starts to suspect that he is the patsy in an elaborate con game. Julia (Mila Kunis), an ex-soap opera actress, is caught in a custody battle for her 6 year-old son with her ex-husband Rick (James Franco), a famous New York artist. With her support cut off and her legal costs ruinous, Julia is reduced to working as a maid in the same upscale boutique hotel where she was once a frequent guest. Julia's lawyer Theresa (Maria Bello) has secured Julia one final chance to change the court's mind and be reunited with the child she loves. Rick's current girlfriend Sam (Loan Chabanol) is a compassionate onlooker.'

With a cast such as this the film works as well as it can with such obtuse twists and turns involving each of the three couples. The film `feels' like it wants to be wonderful, but it just plods along too slowly to make us care very much about this odd groups of maladjusted misfits.

6516727,2,B00LYHXI4I,"As conceived and crafted by writer and director Paul Haggis, Third Person is a big and bold film.  Unfortunately, it is also a rather bad one.  The complex, three-pronged storyline alternates between Rome, Paris, and NYC.  In Italy, a corporate spy (Adrien Brody) is intrigued by a beautiful Italian woman (Moran Atias) in a bar and, in his pursuit of her, becomes involved in a dangerous swindle.  In France, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author (Liam Neeson) tries to shape his new novel while also contemplating and wooing his elusive lover (Olivia Wilde), who has flown in to visit him and another man.  And in the United States, a down-and-out soap-opera actress (Mila Kunis) finds employment as a hotel maid while feuding with her estranged ex-husband (James Franco) over custody of their son.

High-wire editing calls attention to similar symbols and themes shared by the stories, including the specter of absent children.  These build to a self-satisfied twist ending predicated on the desirable and popular, but flawed impulse to interpret fiction as an act of veiled autobiographical confession and analysis.  The mediocrity of the conclusion is compounded by the film's engorged length.  At close to two-and-a-half hours, the ride to the abrupt and too-cute reveal is interminable and, particularly as the first hour gives way to the second, a bit dull.  Easing the pain are largely capable performances by an ensemble cast also including Maria Bello and Kim Basinger, as well as picturesque international photography.  Wilde in particular shines, and her scenes are far and away the most riveting.  In turn sexily teasing, haunted, and cruel, it is an enigmatic performance which could have won her the best reviews of her career if delivered in a stronger overall film.",1412121600,,1777,5.153310104529616
