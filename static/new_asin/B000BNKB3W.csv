8211715,3,B000BNKB3W,"This dvd released in 2006 has 2 interviews, one with Bret Michaels during the 'Flesh and Blood' world tour in 1991 and the other with C.C. Deville in 2000 at the time of his solo album release 'Samantha 7' right before his return to Poison for 'The Power To The People' album.
I believe it's the same dvd as 'Poison Unathorized' and 'Poison Rock Legends' both released in 2003 the only difference is that they have included some music videos this time.
'Stand On The Road' includes the music videos: Every Rose Has It's Thorn, Unskinny Bop, I Won't Forget You, Stand and Your Mama Don't Dance.
The interviews are ok and its good that it does include music from previous poison albums.
Very strange however that the cover of the dvd is a picture of the 'Crack A Smile' album cover which features Blues Saraceno, which makes you believe there is music or footage from 'Crack A Smile' but there isn't. The only reason for this that i can think of is that the latest material used on this dvd was right after the 'Crack A Smile' album was released in 2000. ?",1191888000,,1054,4.438144329896907
