5577793,1,B0066AUL66,Not sure why all the good reviews.  Boring unless you like to watch 20 somethings hanging out by a pool. Turned it off at about the 45 minute mark.  Wait for it on Prime,1449187200,,169,3.9411764705882355
5577794,5,B0066AUL66,"Very good movie, excellent script and storyline. The director did an excellent job with the camera scenes and it was very scary. Wish it was a little longer",1448582400,,156,4.607142857142857
5577795,3,B0066AUL66,"A bunch of friends go on a camping trip and get stalked by a killer.  Definitely a low-budget, B-movie.  Not bad, but a waste of time.",1446681600,3,134,4.115384615384615
5577796,3,B0066AUL66,"I watched this on IMDB, it is 5 min 41 sec long and is silent about a pool cleaner who finds an eyeball floating in his pool and his imagination devolves from there. I mean, its okay for what it is but I think this picture is wrong for what may be being shown on Amazon. I didn't want to pay to see the same 5 min short.  http://www.imdb.com/video/withoutabox/vi1296302873?ref_=tt_pv_vi_aiv_1 ??",1445904000,5,395,4.642857142857143
8565992,1,B0066AUL66,"I blame my imagination. I imagined the historic Marco Polo and his trading party being harassed by Asian supernatural beings, or maybe Marco Polo himself haunting the concubine finishing-schools of Khongirad as a ghost, vampire, or zombie. Anybody who would like to make either of those two movies is welcome to look me up.

Instead, a bunch of California college students celebrate graduation by going to the wilds of Washington state on one of the most poorly-organized camping trips in horror-movie history,  They don't seem to like each other much. They have the survival instincts of moths at Burning Man; it never occurs to them to quit saying the ""magic words"" that get everyone killed. At the very end they patch in some footage of people in what looks like their RenFaire costumes and pass it off as the grisly death of the movie's namesake.",1527811200,,850,4.855172413793103
8565993,5,B0066AUL66,"It was NOT a VCD (Video CD) that was delivered; instead I actually got a DVD (Region 3, perhaps, but DVD better than VCD). ""I have the technology"" to watch Region 3 DVD's just as easily as those native to my region ..... AND IT WAS GLORIOUS, both in terms of movie quality and storyline (I have yet to see a Shaw Brothers martial arts movie that, at the end, I would say I hated it).",1497312000,,383,4.052631578947368
8565994,3,B0066AUL66,Picture quality better than expected and a good watch movie.,1470787200,,60,5.1
8565995,5,B0066AUL66,"I been a life long fan of Shaw Bros movie and let me say that this one is a classic gem, one of the best of Shaw Bros.  Chang Cheh out did himself with this one, from the introduction of the bad guys, yes these 3 bad guys have a face and mad kung fu skills,  one of them which is my favorite Gordon Liu with hair! each with their own personality going up against 4 good guys and with their own different personas and mad kung fu skills, together they try to outwit the 3 bad guys by matching them up skill for skill.  I won't give anything away but most SB movies have really no plot with sub par acting and great action fighting scenes at the very end, sometimes I forward to the near end just to see the fantastic choreographed fight scenes but wait, this one has a good story involving a white guy who starts off evil and finds a soft heart for these shaolin disciples who yes! pair up with their own sifu (masters) who teaches them specific skills they need to counter attack these evil bad guys, these bad guys are pretty scary as you see them have a competition in the beginning of the movie to see who is the deadliest, each of them with their own brand and style of kung fu fighting, it is shown and done here very well with attention to detail.  Did I mention the acting in this one is great too!  Unlike other SB movies where there is only talking for almost the entire movie till the last 20 minutes where only then you see the great  choreographed fights done by Chang Cheh, this one mesmerizes you from beginning till the end with a good plot!  Unfortunately Amazon did not caption this so it's done entirely in Chinese but having saw this 5 times already and having own a dvd of it, I know what is going on.  It's not quite up there with the ""5 Deadly Venom's"" or Gordon Lius masterpiece ""Master Killers"" but it is in my top ten SB movie list.  Good story, good acting, and plenty of fighting scenes to go with it, I'm giving this a well deserving 5 stars!",1465603200,,1970,4.176781002638522
8565996,1,B0066AUL66,Terrible. Don't bother.  Best reviews (5 Stars) where written by the actors .,1455753600,,77,4.923076923076923
8565997,5,B0066AUL66,"This film is good, great story line and acting. The director got very creative with the direction. It's not easy to shoot a horror film in the day light and pull it off. Some very impactful scenes really touched some key point regarding family and planning for the future. The guys who played brothers were awesome, the whole cast was very entertaining to watch. Watch for you self and enjoy.",1453680000,,392,4.614285714285714
8565998,5,B0066AUL66,"Great Movie!
The storyline keeps you glued to the screen the whole 90 minutes.
The special effects where just amazing.
This film is a must watch!
Classic Horror!",1453075200,,161,4.785714285714286
8565999,1,B0066AUL66,"The person that said this movie was great,  with great acting should be the one handing out refunds.  This movie was beyond low budget,  but being a die hard fan of the  horror genre I decided to give it a go.  It was a million rip offs and the acting was beyond horrible.  Do not waste your time or money.  This is no diamond in the rough here.",1452988800,2,345,3.985294117647059
8566000,1,B0066AUL66,Couldn't even get to the 30 minute mark. The scary part is that I paid for this.,1450310400,,80,3.764705882352941
8566001,1,B0066AUL66,Do not watch.  Makes no sense.  There is no way the kids went to college as they portray in the film.,1450310400,,101,3.761904761904762
