5361490,5,B009RWVLN2,"More documentary - with full performances - but what career progress in five years.
I'm a country music fan but more into ""classic"" country (Willie, Waylon, Dolly, George) than many of the new ""hit of the month"" acts but I'm certainly familiar with LA by name and their biggest hit - ""Need You Now"". I was hoping that I'd learn more about the members from watching this DVD and can certainly say that I did - and was entertained as well.
While it revolves around a concert - the last night on their world tour - in Little Rock, AK, this is not the normal ""concert video"". But it's from Eagle Rock Entertainment so I expected there to be documentary footage or interviews included - and there were. The songs performed on stage are connected by footage of the band both on tour and backstage. One prime moment early on is archival footage of the three core members of the band -guitarist/singer Dave Haywood, vocalist Charles Kelley (who can play guitar but rarely does on stage) and  vocalist Hillary Scott - in 2007 playing in really small clubs (100 person capacity) and doing mostly acoustic sets. They pack up and load their own equipment and composer their own songs in their car. Flash forward to this concert where the three travel in a fancy bus - along with a five member band (including Scott's husband) and 18 huge trucks with their stage equipment. But, amazingly, they are still writing their own music on the road and - even more amazing to me - their egos are still in check! These young performers are still the same they were in 2007 (even the torn jeans look the same).

There will be complaints that there is too much ""talking"" on this disc but you can hit the ""skip"" button to just see the performances. But if the group is new to you and you like well written songs, sung by the folks that wrote them, I can easily recommend this BD.

Another reviewer listed the details of all the songs and bonus tracks - some are performances; others are more interview segments. The highlight here for me was the backstage performance of ""Sweet Emotion"". Here was the band just playing for themselves, not the 15,000 folks in the huge Little Rock Arena.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The venue acoustics were terrible, a smaller enclosed stage setting would have played better.

5361495,5,B009RWVLN2,"The DVD is a great buy,  I really enjoy watching it.
There was the story of Lady A before they have been famous & about the song writing & fans during the world tour.
Most songs played in the world tour concert are their greatest hits., which you will enjoy singing along with them for 90 minutes.",1356393600,,297,4.2105263157894735
5361496,3,B009RWVLN2,I own dozens of live blu rays from Iron Maiden to Heart.....So ive seen a ton! The disappointing thing for me is the commentary is mixed in with the concert footage. This plays like a very well done television special brought to blu ray.  I was looking form an entire concert without interruption that can play as a background say for a party etc.  I loved the commentary just wished it would have been separated.  Lady A has a huge career ahead of them so perhaps on the next disc I will get my wish!,1356307200,,501,4.252631578947368
5361497,5,B009RWVLN2,"Having watched this Blu Ray disk twice, I am very impressed with both video and audio quality - certainly one of the best that I have in my substantial collection.
I have not previously heard many LA songs and bought it because I liked ""I run to you"" and ""Just a kiss"". All songs are performed faultlessly with great energy.
Virtually all their songs are sung at the same pitch level and after the first three they all begin to sound more or less the same and it gets a bit too much.
I think if they bring in a better variety, this group will do very well - they certainly have much talent.
For all LA fans buy this one and you will not be sorry!",1355961600,,646,4.094488188976378
5361498,5,B009RWVLN2,"I enjoyed this concert which was filmed at Little Rock, Arkansas.  Lady Antebellum's appeal extends beyond their country roots.  To me, they sound more rock than country.  I hear some or just a little country in their music.  It's like a rock band (but not heavy rock) with country influences.  That's probably why they have a broad appeal.

The blu-ray concert contains songs, plus some very short stories (or mini-documentaries).  The short stories offer a quick window or glimpse into Lady Antebellum.  The only recommendation I would make is to have an option to play only the concert, without the short stories.

Concert is over an hour and 30 minutes (1:34.18).

Here's the set list.

1. Intro

The Eagles When Help Freezes Over did a documentary lead into their reunion DVD and that was cool and this ain't. It's nice to learn about the band and that's fine and dandy. I own all but one of their CD s and they are great - much greater than passing their pre-tour dairy off to devoted fans - we deserve better than this.,1419379200,3,492,4.301075268817204

was a gift to my mom who is a big Lady Antebellum fan.
I watched it with her and we both agreed it was a nicely produced piece,
a balance of concert music and interview clips.

A talented group, no pretense and the fact that the whole band
is incredibly likeable, sweet, sincere & down to earth
elevates Lady Antebellum into a class above the rest.

Lady Antebellum, who formed in 2006, have become one of the premier country trios in the world. They won Best Country Performance by a Duo in 2010 with ""I Run To You,"" and haven't looked back, winning over 40 music awards since then. They've shared the stage with Martina McBride, Jason Aldean, Kenny Chesney, Miranda Lambert, Sugarland and Montgomery Gentry.
Key members are Hillary Scott, Charles Kelly and Dave Haywood.""
And now Lady Antebellum - Own the Night DVD has released. The Eagle Rock Entertainment release covers their 90-minute concert appearance in Little Rock. The performance covers some of their biggest selling hits including ""Just a Kiss,"" ""American Honey,"" ""Hello World,"" ""Love Don't Live Here,""""Wanted You More,"" and ""Need You Now.""
The Nashville based threesome seems to enjoy the experience but try to maintain their humble roots.
""I hope people realize we aren't taking it all for granted,"" said Dave, guitar. ""This is crazy, but we want to enjoy it and do our very best. Twenty years later I hope people will talk about us and say, `They were just genuine people who made genuine music based upon their life experiences'.""
The DVDalso explores their mode of travel from jeep to an army of tour buses, It gives fans a glimpse at life on the road and what it takes to put on a Lady Antebellum show.
""We are just as vulnerable about this music, self-conscious and need approval like anyone else,""  said Charles. ""We recognize we've been given an amazing opportunity and don't want to let anyone down. We hit the lottery. We're just lucky we can sing and play instruments.""",1358294400,,1661,4.907473309608541

5361555,5,B009RWVLN2,"Own the Night World Tour DVD (2012) is awesome. I LOVED ALL THE SONGS on it so much that I've ordered 3 of their newest CD's so I could have many of the same songs on CD's. This past New Year's Eve {2012} hubby and I watched this DVD for the first time to ring in the new year. It was amazing. If you like songs, Need You Now, Own the Night and Just a Kiss you will love this live performance. It was non stop music with a little bit of documentary thrown in ~ of how they first started out and what good friends they all are. I enjoyed hearing this, since it was news to me and it helped me get to know the group better and appreciate them even more. On the bonus features they sang Sweet Emotion which was one of my favorite songs by Steven Tyler and Aero Smith. They did a great job. Black Water is also there and it's an old song. They rocked it...and did a great job singing it with Thompson Square and Darius Rucker. It was well worth the money... @$9.99. We have a blue ray player, but I didn't buy the DVD in Blue Ray, since playing a regular DVD on a Blue Ray comes out in High Def anyway. I can hardly tell the difference.
The 90-minute performance includes No. 1 hits I Run To You, We Owned The Night, American Honey, Just A Kiss, Our Kind of Love and of course, the greatest selling country single of all time, Need You Now. Among the performances are documentary excerpts depicting their lives as songwriters, musicians, and most importantly...close friends. / Track Listing:

I would have preferred to watch an entire concert straight thru. But the music & show is really great!,1357430400,,257,4.586956521739131

I wish there was more music and less talking.",1517011200,,65,3.7142857142857144
8543959,4,B009RWVLN2,"I saw Lady Antbellum, while they were on this tour.  I have been to a lot of concert's over the years.  And theirs was as good as any I have seen.  This dvd is good but there are segments in the concert where they talk about what they ar doing and that takes away from the concert.  They do a lot of their big hits like American Honey.  But my favorite on here is an album cut called Stars Tonight.  They Absolutely nail it.  But everything they do is good.",1505001600,,457,4.011111111111111
