8180208,4,B000NO23VC,"The bachelorette party half of this set is very good, with the exception of the terrible shaky camera work (which is supposed to be part of the appeal as a fake home video). Even has a significant amount of explicit nudity, so big props for that. And huge props for the inclusion of Kitana Baker.

The party girl side of the set isn't as good; it has its moments but doesn't have women who are as attractive as the other although at least one of them is smoking hot (one I don't recognize). Also doesn't have as much exposure.

Run time of each is about an hour, give or take. A good bundle.",1422057600,,591,4.221238938053097
8180209,4,B000NO23VC,"I like a lot of the Playboy Exposed DVDs because they're like a sexy reality TV show. To me, a lot of the regular Playboy DVDs are over-produced, so stylized and artsy that they're not realistic any more. Maybe some people like that. But in these 2 DVDs, the girls are mostly just acting normal, with cameras following them around. For the most part, people in them seem to be having a lot of fun too. The main problem with the Playboy Exposed series is that the camerawork and editing are sometimes shoddy. Lighting is sometimes not great either. These 2 DVDs generally have mediocre production values, but ""Bachelorette Party"" is worse about that, where at times the camera is very shaky and wandering at random. Why didn't they edit more of that out? But dang, there sure are a bunch of sexy girls on there! They're shown at a car wash (in wet t-shirts and flashing), at a clothing store, then at home lying by the pool and stripping for each other inside. It's a plus that the sound is usually live rather than some music track.

""Confessions of a Party Girl"" is better filmed and edited, but has less variety since the whole thing is set at a party. Again, it's got very sexy girls in it, with the party scenes of people dancing having a music track, while rooms outside the party, or outside by the pool, usually have live sound. If you like realistic situations as I do, some of the best scenes on here, and indeed on both of these, are when several of the girls are just hanging around nude chatting with each other or doing silly things. They're acting like everything is normal, and I'm going *drool*drool*drool* Another major difference between them is that Bachelorette has only girls in it, while Confessions has several guys added, though they're much de-emphasized.

There's a lot of nudity on both of these, sometimes total and sometimes topless or bottomless. However, there's really no explicit sexual activity on either one. The picture on both is 1.33:1. I hesitated to give these 4 stars because of the rather low production values, and really Bachelorette deserves a 3 because of that, but still I think they're quite hot and worth the money, especially if you can get them discounted.",1248220800,3,2207,4.656410256410257
