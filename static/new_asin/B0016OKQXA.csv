8263594,1,B0016OKQXA,"Unless you want to see lots of highlights from the three Flash Gordon serials, this isn't even worth a rental, and certainly its $24.95 list price is quite outrageous and completely unjustified, even if this 46-minute show weren't so mediocre.",1391904000,,243,5.1
8263595,4,B0016OKQXA,"This was a solid effort by A & E to explain the popularity of Flash Gordon.  He was indeed a hero for his times.  The use of many of Alex Raymond's comic strips is a strength of this program.  The narrator called ""ALEX"" Raymond ""ALEC"" throughout the entire program and that was rather annoying.  I give A & E credit for going outside the box with its Biography series to include the fictional Flash Gordon.  I wish it had been longer than 50 minutes!",1258502400,4,450,4.309523809523809
