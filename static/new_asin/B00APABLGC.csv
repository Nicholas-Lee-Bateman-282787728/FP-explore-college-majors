Then, Season 3 started out with subtitles.  But Part 45 froze and when I tried to get it back, there were no subtitles.  So I guess that's the end of the road for me.",1431820800,,316,4.2
8555661,5,B00APABLGC,"Saw this on netflix but it did not finish the series, 3x09 thru 3x22 are not included on it nor on this one. Apparently these are not out yet but it does continue after the bomb at the hotel. Diego gets sick, tries to sell hotel, closing of hotel, etc., all great episodes but don't know where to find them. OH well another cliffhanger!",1406678400,5,336,4.265625
