2021423,1,B0001OGUU4,"This is more of an instructional video that you might watch in a high school PE class once before you go out and try it than a pilates routine designed for lower back pain.  It gives a few minutes of explanation for each move along with ""recaps"" on previous moves, but never establishes a fluid routine.  This painful process goes on for an hour!  DVD is a complete waste of money, try MTV pilates if you are trying to strengthen your back and stomach!",1087776000,25,452,4.357142857142857
8015457,5,B0001OGUU4,"I have deteriorative disck disease, and extremely tight back muscles! This DVD is amazing for people with bad backs that need to stretch their back and strengthen their core muscles. Great for beginners or people after a bad injury! This is not a crazy get fit, pump it out routine, but a proper instructional DVD in saving your back and getting your back to a healthy and comfortable state! I love it and use it every morning to get me going. I feel fantastic. And after using this exercise reigime for 4months I feel I could progress to something more intense.",1443830400,,562,4.574257425742574
8015458,5,B0001OGUU4,"I was a candidate for back surgery. Two permanently herniated lower disks. I asked the surgeon what other options I had and he said pilates. I tried numerous videos and this is the one that worked for me. When I started I was walking with a cane and reinjuring my back every two to five years. I have been using this video for 11 years and have not hurt my back seriously since. To the review critics, it does not flow but I don't need  to follow the video, I don't even play it anymore. The girl does the exercises if your back is really bad (like when I started). The guy does more advanced exercises for when your back improves. I do about 10 reps of each exercise and it takes around 30 minutes. I also do the Pilates on the go for golf video also.",1381968000,2,752,4.115646258503402
8015459,4,B0001OGUU4,"All the negative reviews this video has received has been based on a lack of a workout, lack of a flow. Well, this video isn't intended for that, as I find it to be more of a rehabilitation video for people who suffer from chronic to severe back pain. I do pilates and yoga regularly, and I've been looking for something gentle that I could recommend to a senior with lower back pain. Pilates is great for strengthening the abdominal area, thereby preventing back pain...but it can be dangerous to do without private instruction if you already have back injuries. Doing exercises with the wrong muscles engaged, in the wrong positions can do much more harm than good. In the beginning this video offers thorough explanations on standing posture and how to tighten your abdominal muscles correctly for pilates to be effective. Then some gentle stretches follow and finally a a few exercises which strengthen the abdomen and correct the posture. Each movement is performed slowly with two exercise models, one performing an extremely gentle version, the other a slightly more advanced version. The instructor offers extremely detailed explanations during on correct form, what not to do, how to make it gentler, what the modifications accomplish and the benefits of each pose. The instructor is extremely gentle, speaks extremely clearly and has a very matter of fact but gentle manner. Think along the lines of a physical therapist, rather than a fitness trainer.

For me, this was exactly what I was looking for. Since I can't be there personally to show form or help with exercise modification, I was looking for something that is the next best thing to a personal teacher. This is very gentle, though of course I would recommend asking your doctor first and I would not recommend doing this right after an injury. But I think it is good for absolute beginners to pilates who have back pain, who need to slowly work up to an exercise routine. Yes, this video is mostly instruction and moves very slowly. Likely you would become well versed in form and these exercises, then give it to a friend or someone else while you move on to something more advanced. However, it is worth it for the very detailed explanations, which you won't find in a normal pilates video, you won't find in a pilates class at your gym, rather you would need a session with a physical therapist to get something similar.

So why only 4 stars? The production quality is rather poor, though not so poor as to be unwatchable. The DVD was released in 2004, though on a first watch through I would have guessed early 90's. Also, it would have been useful to have the stretches and exercises available as a flowing series as a part 2 on the disk, to be able to do the exercises with less guidance once you're thoroughly familiar with the explanations.

Important! As a final note, I must mention that while excellent and gentle, almost all exercises require you to sit or lie on the floor. Now this is not a rapid ""sit down - stand up - sit down - stand up"" kind of thing. Once you sit down, you stay there, then once you lie down you stay on your back. But if you are unable to do that, then this is not the video for you. I would then recommend a yoga routine in which you are sitting in a chair. Rodney Yee (amazing yoga instructor, one of my favorites) has a DVD called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Backcare-Yoga-For-Beginners/dp/B00018WNHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Backcare Yoga For Beginners</a>which supposedly uses chair exercises. However, since I haven't personally seen that video I can't recommend it except based on his reputation and my opinion of him as a (DVD) yoga instructor. A warning, though, his yoga has more of a dynamic style, not good if you're looking for slow and steady. If you can follow written and picture instructions well, the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-For-Dummies/dp/0470502029/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga For Dummies</a>&nbsp;is excellent for anything and everything yoga. But the best part is it also has a section called ""Prime of Life Yoga"" which is for adults who are new to yoga (up to very senior). This part has 2 routines for gentle exercises in which you are sitting in a chair the whole time. There is also a section for back pain. Excellent, but it is a book, so the instruction are likely more difficult to follow.

So, I highly recommend this DVD if, based on my description, it's what you're looking for. Not a workout, but gentle, thorough instruction to start you on strengthening and pain relief. In that regard I think it's excellent.",1380067200,5,4667,4.948979591836735
8015460,5,B0001OGUU4,It was recommended by my neurosurgeon.  It is exactly what I need.  I am having my husband also use it.  It helps strengthen the core muscles needed.,1348790400,2,149,4.444444444444445
8015461,1,B0001OGUU4,"I wouldn't have given this DVD one star but wasn't allowed to rate it ""No Stars.""  I just returned the DVD for a refund.  Why?  First, the quality of the DVD itself is unacceptable, the picture is grainy and very poor, the audio is off pace with the ""Actor's"" voice (very distracting).  For these reasons, I would have returned the DVD even if the program was good.  But it wasn't.  It is the most boring pilates program I've ever seen.  Is it really pilates?  My husband bought this DVD as a gift for me.  When it arrived, we decided to preview it before using it to work out.  In less than 3 minutes I noticed my husband had fallen asleep.  I started to laugh but dozed off myself before I could get out a chuckle (seriously).  I am very disappointed that Amazon didn't have their quality control check out this DVD before offering it for sale.",1239840000,,846,4.352564102564102

I have problems with my lower back and this dvd is really good at pointing out correct methods for stretching and doing strength exercises.

It's a good workout for someone whose back is in a lot of pain, but would probably be too easy for someone with a healthy back.",1190592000,22,387,4.1891891891891895
8015463,2,B0001OGUU4,"I won't waste your time reiterating what previous reviewers have already said about how the exercises don't flow, it's not really a workout, and the exercises are too gentle for people who are in shape but just suffer from occasional back pain.  I would like to add, however, that there are aspects of this video that are really unintentionally funny.  The instructor's lackeys (a guy and a girl) are particularly amusing.  (What do you call the people who demonstrate the exercises anyway?  Exercisers?  Models?)  The male lackey seems to have a room-temperature IQ, as demonstrated by the following exchange:

Instructor: ""Now grab your right ankle with your left hand...""

[Lackey reaches for his left ankle with his right hand.]

Instructor:  ""No, your right ankle...""

The fact that they didn't do another take after teaching this guy his left from his right tells you all you need to know about how little effort went into this video.

In most exercise videos (not that I'm an expert, but we've all seen a few minutes of it while channel surfing at 4 am), the lackeys/models/whatchamacallits have a slight smile, or at the very least a neutral expression on their faces.  These two have these blank, perpetually confused looks on their faces, and their eyes dart around like they're trying to understand the inner workings of the Theory of Relativity whenever the instructor speaks.

This is the only Pilates video I've ever seen, so I don't really have a basis for comparison.  But if the popularity of Pilates is any indication of the quality of the program, then I'd have to think that there's better stuff than this available on DVD.",1159142400,7,1643,4.88086642599278
8015464,2,B0001OGUU4,"I checked this out from my library, thinking it might be appropriate for me, someone who sometimes has occasional low back pain and neck/shoulder pain.

The instructor is very knowledgeable. He goes into a good explanation of posture and theory of Pilates and completely explains all of the moves with two subjects who demonstrate, and they also demonstrate variations on most of the movements for people who are even tighter or have more severe back issues.

But this was much too gentle and detailed for me. I can pretty much do a full range of movements, whereas the people whom this video is intended for probably cannot.

Also, as noted by another reviewer, there is no ""workout"". The explanations are interwoven through the demonstration video, so there is much pausing between each exercise and therefore no ""flow"". I do prefer the workout videos for pilates that have an explanation section first and then a solid workout afterward, without pauses.

That said, I did sit down and go through the entire video one time and do all the exercises along with the video, as gentle and slow as it was. The stretches for the back are very good and my back felt great afterwards, but I certainly didn't feel like I'd done a workout.",1125792000,28,1230,4.76056338028169
