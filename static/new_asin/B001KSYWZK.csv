8339400,2,B001KSYWZK,The pace of the DVD was too fast and if you are a beginner in yoga you are going to face difficulties following it.  I did not like it at all.,1398297600,,142,3.5806451612903225
8339401,3,B001KSYWZK,"This video has a lot of good information, but it starts out with very difficult poses with no explanation for variations for a person just getting into yoga.  Had this been my first experience of yoga and I not known that the poses take practice to get to the point the examples show in the video I would probably have been so discouraged I would never have gone any further in the practice of yoga.  In the beginning it does encourage individuals to seek the help of a yoga instructor which would be very necessary for anyone just beginning yoga and hoping to use this dvd to enhance your knowledge.",1390089600,,600,4.445454545454545
