3863038,2,B0027BOL46,"This is a slice of life from New York in 2008 with a hard to find story and a narrative structure that bounces around here and there from muddled comment to half-hearted observation to low-key interview.  We follow a high priced escort to some of her ""dates"" and she has a bunch of conversations and almost kinda sorta makes a decision about a relationship in her life.  It's very low key, like a bunch of real people chatting in several normal moments.  It isn't a powerful narrative that leads up to an unforgettable, er, climax.  So it's got that sort of artsy tone for sure.  But I'm not sure its aspirations are as artsy -- i.e. aspiring to make some bigger, artistic point -- as the style.  At the end of the day it doesn't feel like a My Dinner With Andre or Five Easy Pieces or The Conversation or Lost in Translation or whatever artsy sort of low key but powerful film you want to mention.  Maybe I missed it but for me it just didn't add up to that.  Sometimes there can be a lack of emotion on the screen but powerful underlying emotion that sort of comes together in the end?  Didn't really get that either.  So to me it was kind of interesting to spend some time in NY and the fact that she had a career as a high priced escort was I suppose sort of interetsing for a while, but it never emotionally grabbed me. Cast was fine, including lead actress who apparently has a career in more ""revealing"" films...  She should try again with a character who has more to do.

I like the poster though.",1241481600,8,1505,4.279151943462898
3863039,1,B0027BOL46,"Given the director I expected at least a semi-decent film. I knew it had an actual porn star as the lead role, so I at least expected a good sex scene. It had NO sex scene AT ALL.

Chelsea, the self-absorbed call-girl had the personality of a computerized voice. The entire dialogue can be condensed to her clients complaining about the failing economy and the 2008 election whilst dining and shopping. Ms. Call-girl also drones about the clothes she wears while seeing her clients.

There is also a fillippty-floppity time line which makes things worse, but not nearly as bad as her annoying boyfriend who whines and moans while his whore goes out whoring.

Best of all, there is no ending! No resolution whatsoever. You don't know what happened to her clingy boyfriend, she goes on to sleep with ugly smelly men and obsesses over numerology or astrology or some other new age BS and they BAM:the end!

Worst 10 dollars I ever spent, fyi, I'm a girl and I thought this girl was cute, but hey...Ms. Grey should not quit her day job because in her XXX stuff she seems to be having a much better time.",1241395200,18,1099,4.5353535353535355
3863040,4,B0027BOL46,"Slow and narratively brutal, the film appeals to those of us with Soderbergh  and doc' passion. Because it lacks a dramatic arc (character goes from one extreme to another), it does not appeal to NASCAR dads, except those who want to ogle Sasha Grey's body double's perfect figure. However, it lives in my head as an extremely realistic portrayal of the call girl's struggle - or lack of it.",1470700800,,391,4.666666666666667

There is no joy in this film, which perhaps should not be too surprising given its depressing subject matter of prostitution, too often a pursuit for life's losers. One cannot help wondering why he made this film and why he cast Grey..A more interesting and capable actress might have rescued the production from its gloomy and shallow feeling. That said, every film is a complex undertaking that requires teamwork of a high order from everyone involved, and there is no way to guess what might have arisen during the writing, planning, production and editing process.",1444521600,,938,5.097402597402597

The dumb move of those five days was going on the weekend trip, which he dropped her like the whore she is, and told her boy friend that she was going no matter what he said. She told him that he had not right to get mad at her (yelling at her and he had every right) for her to ""SEE IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE""  Why would any guy with his own self respect be in a relationship with a woman that is in that life style.  There is no amount of money that she could earn that true love for a woman could allow for that.  The guy was doing that just to see what it felt like to screw a whore.  For her to even think for a moment that this guy would leave his wife and two little guys puts her in the insane category.  When the reporter asked at the end if she ever thought about a real relationship she could not look at him and nearly started crying because she knew that she was and she threw it away for a fling that never happened.",1436054400,,1178,3.940928270042194

3863107,5,B0027BOL46,"Stephen Soderbergh is a massively underrated director, and that's a crying shame. I've yet to see a film by him that I was really disappointed in. Contagion was unique and thrilling, his presentation of William Greaves's ""Symbiopsychotaxiplasm"" was intriguing, and now I have seen his unique stab at the art house genre. To be honest, I can see why people would develop a distaste for this film. Indeed it is slow and just a lot of people talking with a prostitute, but the film is so much more than that. Soderbergh uses the conversations in the film to display a growing concern for the budget deficit that has been inflating in America the past several years, and has a unique central aspect to his film that really kept me going.

Sasha Grey plays a woman named Chelsea, a prostitute who offers a unique experience to her clients. Instead of simply having sex and leaving, she lets her clients treat her like she is their girlfriend, which usually involves fancy multi-course dinners and intricate conversations involving current events. Most of the topics seemed to stay strictly political, but seeing how that is the point of the film, it didn't really bother me.

Chelsea has a boyfriend who doesn't seem to mind her profession, and doesn't seem to be bothered by the intimate ways her clients treat her. Until, of course, one of her clients offers to take her on a trip to Saudi Arabia to ""expand her business."" This results in a verbal fight between the two and a close examination on how her profession really has affected their relationship in ways they hadn't noticed before.

At 77 minutes, The Girlfriend Experience is an incredibly short film. But it packs so much into those 77 minutes that it will seem like it's over two hours long, and it really made for a unique... experience (some pun intended.) The topics Soderbergh covers in his film had me listening all the way through, and the way they were presented were pretty cool as well. I honestly can see why a lot of people wouldn't like this film, it's too artistic for mainstream audiences. But what I got out of it was a beautiful examination of current events in America, and one that I really enjoyed to the end.",1429056000,,2187,4.675324675324675

3863359,4,B0027BOL46,I thought I should rate this film only because it seems to have had such bad reviews done about it and I didn't even watch it for a while because of them. If you are looking for pornography you are in the wrong place. If you are looking for a movie that you don't have to think about you are also in the wrong place. I am not saying the movie is perfect. I do think however that the stark loneliness of the concept is appealing if you are in the mood for it. Other reviewers have commented on this but I think isolation is the largest theme. Everything in the lives of the characters exemplify a sort of longing for connection that can never be satisfied and Sasha Grey's performance to personify this I think was appropriate. Her character seems stoic and professional but at the same time gentle when she is with customers. Her job as an escort requires her to falsify an attachment with clients. She accomplishes this by presenting herself as an ideal form to a society that is purely materialistic getting into higher society on her appearance. This focus on only the physical form creates emotional isolation for these characters because no one is able to get through to anyone's actual self. This then creates a spiral of continually raising barriers and never connecting with others. The issue of societies continual search for satisfying materialistic and carnal urges while avoiding actual connection is the subject of this movie. If that doesn't sound interesting then give this movie a pass. If not watch it and see what you think.,1396224000,4,1542,4.652014652014652

3863363,4,B0027BOL46,"I actually give it a 3.5 rating because I am not sure how I feel about it yet. Sasha Grey gave an understated performance that drove home the point of how detached she was as a person. In the story she is a high class call girl who meticulously writes down her encounters down to a detailed report of the expensive shoes she was wearing. She is young and thinks she is saavy but as the story unfolds we see her bad decisions and how she is taken advantage of. It is a business and we get an inside look at her day to day activities. Her boyfriend is a personal trainer trying unsuccessfully to sell his his own brand and we see his endeavors as he meets with potential clients. He makes 100 dollars an hour while she makes 1000. He is a likable character who is honest and is aware of his girlfriends business. There are rules to the game and we see what happens when Sasha breaks those rules. The movie is disjointed as it jumps back and forth through time. At first I enjoyed the challenge but after awhile I got confused and could not put the pieces together. Maybe this was Steven Soderbergh's idea to illustrated the disjointedness of her life. If you are looking for a titillating experience this is not the movie for you. It is a story with little nudity or sexual content and is filmed like a documentary. It is challenging to sympathize with the couple but there is a wonderful scene where he confronts her about her foolish choices and spells out exactly what the consequences will be. Like a prophecy that is exactly what happens. Any couple who has had a split up will see themselves in the scene. I found I wanted to see if Sasha would recover and possibly leave her life of sin but that was not the case. There is a scene after the credits that gives a hint of her decision. This is an adult themed film and would not be of interest to many people because it is not a Hollywood film and takes some concentration as the film does not have a discernible plot nor does it have a beginning, middle and end in the way we might like. We also see the men who hire her and try to give her financial advice or steer her away from an imploding stock market. Most of them use her as a therapist and try to figure her out. Steven Soderbergh and Sasha were said to have interviewed two call girls and one comes away with the sense that this is not a glamorous profession and that being a customer is embarrassing and ridiculous. Sasha's character may make 2000 an hour but what does it do to her soul?",1394668800,,2502,4.269473684210526

 The acting in general is quite convincing, at no point offering question as to the reality of the characters which are presented as actual stratalities, a difficult feat done superbly denoting an incredible intelligence in design.
 From a cinematographic standpoint the movie does not shoot very high at all, nearly all scenes are shot with a still camera, nominal lighting, and little movement in scene. This rather lackluster presentation does little to enhance the viewer experience, yet conveys information without any rude interruptions.
 Overall the movie is pleasant to watch, the viewer is easily exposed to rather difficult complexities, with a ""take it or leave it"" attitude, never rushing ideas, yet failing to achieve cohesions, resulting in a full experience half viewed.

Sasha Grey's acting is decent, but can come off amateurish and mechanical at certain junctures in the movie. I have not seen her other main stream movies and probably will never bother. She shows more emotion in her adult flicks were she's the ruler of fake moaning. The movie is about an escort that gets paid to have sex for money (wow how oringinal) she gives her clients a destorted view of what she calls a girlfriend experience. Furthermore, these clients have more money then the law would allow, trust me their no angels.
  They pay her four thousand dollars a session! Meanwhile she has a boy friend who is a gym trainer who's trying to, will and deal to make ends meat and he accepts her life style, when she complains to him about other escorts running into her territory he nonchalantly shrugs it off by saying she's the most beautiful and talented person he knows...really?

3863457,4,B0027BOL46,"I debated as to whether I should offer my review for several reasons:

1.) I rarely review movies unless I have some personal connection (I.E. Too Big to Fail and Margin Call)

2.) There are already a plethora of film critics

3.) With 75-reviews on Amazon, there are already a cross section of opinions on GFE

Here is to hoping that people are not overly harsh =:)

First and foremost, you have Steven Soderbergh, a director that rotates between biopics in the vein of ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""The Informatant"", social dramas like ""Traffic"" and big budget pop like ""Oceans 11"".  I am not sure how to characterize one of my favorite action movies of the year ""Haywire"" featuring the acting debut of Gina Carano.  GFE was made for +-$1.3m and filmed over the course of a long weekend.

Truth be told, I never saw any of Sasha's movies, though I did see her on Entourage in her stint as Vince's girlfriend.

While Sasha's character was not particularly likable, what I liked was the way in which she gave a running commentary of her ""dates"" in a monotone voice (I.E. I wore a Gucci dress and Christian LaBeouf heels, the client was attractive, so that......).  Admitting that ""I know people that know people"", a number of things rang true:

1.) Her profession was a conscious decision on her part.  There were no sinister forces at play

2.) The fact that despite her chosen profession she was in a committed relationship

3.) She was the dominant party in her personal relationship (BF was a personal trainer)

4.) Her competitive nature when she saw a client with another girl

5.) Perhaps most compelling was the scene where she visited this Web Master of an Escort Review Site.  The guy who runs the site is middle aged (overweight and slovenly, as a descriptive factor only) and is set up in a bare bones loft like space located above a family business.  He goes on to tell her what he can do for her by promoting her on her site (I.E. setting up a lucrative trip to The Middle East, etc.).  All he needs is some ""play"" (AKA a freebie) to get a better idea of what kind of ""experience"" she offers.  In reality, there is an extremely popular site that many ""hobbyists"" consider critical in the decision making process.  It was also rumored that it the early days of said site that similar tactics may have been employed

The movie winds down with her meeting a client (married) that she seems to have a connection with and agrees to go away with for the weekend (going ahead and meeting him at a location).  She tells her current BF that this is something she feels that she has to pursue to see if anything is really ""there"".  BF is obvious not happy and leaves.  Client changes his mind (doesn't show, but calls), after speaking with his children on the phone.  Fade out, she received the call (stating that he changed his mind) and shortly thereafter learns of the horrific review that aforementioned Web Master gave her as a result of the ""freebie"" (review was read in the Web Master's voice).  She breaks down and we see tears for the first time!

This is not ""happy fare"".  None of the characters are particularly likable.  What ""it"" is-is thought provoking and IMHO, the single camera and monotone dialogue all create the requisite effects.

I suppose that I can understand both spectrums of the reviews given and perhaps were I in a different frame of mind, the movie would have had a lesser effect.  In summation, the old adage (and acronym) YMMV is the most apropos.",1335830400,,3477,4.576051779935275

3863480,2,B0027BOL46,"The plot of The Girlfriend Experience is, essentially, girl works as escort and has accepting boyfriend, girl falls for client, boyfriend dumps girl, client dumps girl, girl is alone.  This is not a very interesting plot, nor one that gives us any insight into either the life of escorts or the human condition.  The hook (other than the well-advertised bit about having a porn star play the escort) is that the scenes are not arranged chronologically, so boredom is staved off by the prurient interests of finding out details like what the special client did to make the girl fall for him.

What the film purports to be, I'm not sure.  The other Soderbergh films I've seen--Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Ocean's Eleven, and Traffic--were all, I thought, underwhelming and overpraised.  In particular, Traffic was a poorly acted and 2-dimensional film with what was, in the context of Hollywood and the international film community, a safe and pedestrian socio-political message.  The Girlfriend Experience is in the same vein.  Despite some formal interest in the way of cinematography and a well-executed job of editing, the film is empty.  There is no exploration of the characters' personalities.  They are almost stereotypes.  Things that Soderbergh has said interested him in the film, such as the impact of technology on the escort service (no more madames!), are lacking in both complexity and presentation.  Technology has changed lots of industries by taking out the middle-man.  Why is this interesting in escorting?  And how do we see the changes in the film?

That Sasha Grey stars in the film neither adds nor detracts.  She exists on-screen as a passive non-entity, but this is also how her character is written and directed.  The only jarring bits are points when the male characters praise her beauty or skill at her job.  We never see her interacting with clients except by giving mono-syllabic reponses, and the other women in the film are better looking than she is.  If Soderbergh failed to see this, it makes one wonder why.

Although on one level the film seems to be presenting escorts as independent business-women, on another it re-inforces many of our prejudices and stereotypes about escorting (e.g., she has no other skillset, the money is too good to get out, the clients are socially dysfunctional, etc) and in this way is simply a moralizing tale about a girl that ends up all alone.

She has a boyfriend who is a professional trainer seeking higher pay. Was this movie inspired by Alexandra Dupree, or whatever her name was? This film certainly gives some insight as to the business of prostitution and how it runs actively amongst congressmen, such as Spitzer? The choppy scenes were filled with lots of lonely men with a lot of money, boring political chats about the falling economy, and pathetic acting. I think it's safe to say the movie wasn't as effective as Steven Soderbergh intended it to be. It was like a poor documentary. The most interesting aspect of the film was the diary Chelsea kept. She had a record of every client and their preferences. She even noted the designer outfits she wore on specific days.  I guess things get interesting when Chelsea decides to go on a trip with a client to ""find herself"". Her boyfriend becomes very upset with this decision. The couple is caught up in trying to make money. Sasha's voice is monotone and she's got a Goth-vampire looking face. Not worth $2, 000, even though that's still a cheap price. She is boring and ordinary. The last scene with the priest was disturbing. In an interview with AssociatedPress Sasha says she hopes her performances will help others to, ""not be afraid of being a sexual being"" and to adjust the stereotype of porn stars. Yeah, whatever Sasha, get real.  She got into porn to make money, not to challenge stereotypes or to liberate woman's sexuality.

3863483,1,B0027BOL46,"Sasha Grey (born Marina Ann Hantzis), she's the new ""it"" porn-queen that has gone mainstream.  The lithe 21-year old from California has made quite a name for herself in the few short years she been in the pornographic movie industry taking home no less than (7) AVN awards from 2007 to 2010.  Since coming of age she has become quite the entrepreneur branching out into music, modeling, and now mainstream television (Entourage 2010) and headlining the 2009 Steven Soderbergh movie ""The Girlfriend Experience.""

The Story

Written by David Levien (Walking Tall, Ocean's Thirteen) and Brian Koppelman (Walking Tall, Ocean's Thirteen), but directed by Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Traffic, Solaris), Sasha Grey portrays Chelsea a high-class prostitute in Manhattan, who lives with her boyfriend of 1.5 years Chris (Chris Santos).

That's the story as far as I can tell...

My Thoughts

...because ""The Girlfriend Experience"" had no story to speak of!  The movie is a bore! I was expecting a little insight on this trend in high-end prostitution called ""The Girlfriend Experience"" wherein men pay the women to act like their girlfriends and sometimes don't even have sex, they just want to talk, or cuddle, or have dinner, etc.  Needless to say I gained little insight into the trend from this movie.

It's hard to nail down what ""The Girlfriend Experience"" was about; the movie isn't linear, it kept jumping around between the past, the present and the future.  After a while I gave up trying to follow what was going on, as Sasha as Chelsea narrates little tidbits about certain clients, but that narration is never put into focus for the viewer.  Why is she relaying this information to us, because in the end it was meaningless?

""The Girlfriend Experience"" is not a coherent whole, it is instead little unrelated bits thrown together out of context we, the viewer, are supposed to piece together and make sense of.  My question is why?  Why was the movie shot this way instead of more linear film with an easier to follow narrative?  Could it be it is because the Girlfriend Experience really has nothing of value to say and scrambling the pieces (scenes) would give it cache it otherwise would not embrace?

Sasha Grey may be the darling of the porn industry, but as a mainstream actress in this film, she is less than compelling, delivering most of her dialog in a flat monotone voice that is as boring as the movie.  And the rest of the cast is no better!

""The Girlfriend Experience's"" few positive elements (loved the tight focus shots on Sasha face--hey I said she could act, but she is very pleasant to look at) are ultimately rendered moot by the movie's pointless and confusing non-linear structure and trite, boring, and meaningless conversations.

3863505,5,B0027BOL46,"Soderbergh is laughing--alone. The reviews here are ironically revelatory and you see the usual menu, right out of Oprah: ""communication,"" ""love,"" go down the list.

In point of fact, everyone here is developing a ""brand."" If they can get off en route, fine. If not, fine. This is what you produce in lieu of, if possible--in adjunct to, if necessary--a product or a service. Turn on CNBC and you will hear the same mantra.

The service is now an afterthought. Note carefully the escort's comments on the clothes she is wearing, where she and her client met, dined, rutted, the statistical data she records in her nearly charming trailer-trash account of her service. Trailer trash she may be--and you hear the jumped-up journalist do his schtick before he, too, hits on her--but she is merely a sad downmarket echo of the CNBC zeitgeist.

Observe the boyfriend, if that's what he is: also developing his own brand, working on the marketing, whether himself or his (unidentified, meaningless) product. The ""couple's"" efforts to develop their respective brands is the subject of calm, deliberate conversation, so long as she plays by the surreal new rules in service to the marketing. These new rules are mesmerizing.

Note the tenor of all conversation. New age analytical. It is all commercial or ""political."" Any distinction is elusive.

The economy has crashed. It is in excellent company here.

The service itself? An afterthought. Every time--if it comes off at all. After the consumption is consummated and the marketing misery discussed--and this is the ultimate intimacy--here was the chance to address/undress the reality. The escort is post-content, soundbite tabula rasa, semi-adept at being whatever our post-capitalist clientele would like her to be at the personal/commercial level. Aided and abetted every step of the way. Casting a porn star was an act of genius.

Both efforts at a way out, that of the escort, that of her roommate: doomed. No exit. This is a cul-de-sac. Some games you play and you will get burnt. A brand, after all, is still a brand.

3863506,3,B0027BOL46,"Businessmen like paying for things because it gives them a sense of power. According to Soderbergh, its not the paying clients who get confused about the nature of professional relationships (including those involving various forms of payed intimacy), its the call girl who gets confused.

In Solaris, everyone is confused about the nature of their intimate relationships, and everyone lives in their own solipsistic fantasy worlds where others are just projections from their own subconscious. In this film, all the men seem to understand the illusory nature of relationships and accept that; its the call girl who is, ironically, the only one who holds out hope for a genuine human connection.

The male characters like paying for what they want, and the most interesting male client, the journalist, is paying not for the call girl's body but for her story, her truth. The problem is that she doesn't have any ""story"" or ""truth."" She is so used to becoming what other men want her to be, that she no longer knows the difference between authentic and manufactured experiences/intimacies. She's become the perfect actress, a kind of blank slate upon which any man can write anything at all. Its a tragedy if there can be anything like tragedy in this postmodern world.

Soderbergh is exploring Godardian terrain here but not really extending our understanding of that terrain as Godard was already postmodern. At least with Godard, the solipsistic characters at least had the ability to grasp the tragic nature of their inauthentic (because always scripted by others) existence. In Soderbergh the characters are not afforded such privileged glimpses of self.",1290556800,8,1659,5.159851301115242
3863507,3,B0027BOL46,"The Girlfriend Experience has a really decent plot - it's about how Sasha Grey plays an escort who ends up spending a lot of her time listening to men instead of just having sex with them. It shows some of the issues about being an escort as well as the fact that men can take advantage of you and you can't do anything since it's illegal. The plot ended up being decent.

However, after watching this movie, I was left wondering if I had just wasted my time. It's a decent movie, but I feel like it's something I'd only want to have watched if I was bored - not to take time out of my day and watch it. The acting was good which is something I wasn't expecting from Sasha Grey. The storyline was pretty good as well. I just feel like the action moves really slowly - sometimes we sit on one scene with Sasha speaking to another person for at least ten minutes. It just makes the movie move really slowly.

Along with that, there was the actual movie. I know this is more of an indie movie than anything else, but the odd timeline of this movie made it harder to enjoy. That is, the creators skipped around a lot in the movie. First we'd see the end of the movie, then the beginning, then the end, then the middle, then the beginning, and so-on and so forth. At the beginning, you are going to be downright confused and may think this is a giant waste of your time. Towards the middle, it starts to make more sense, and at the end, it actually all comes together. Only to cut off too abruptly. The entire movie is based around Sasha Grey falling for one of her clients and her relationship with her boyfriend. We never actually end up finding out what happens with her relationship with her boyfriend - it's a sore spot with me since without that information, I feel like learning about the entire plot was a waste of time.

Whether it's the jeweler who climaxes within a hug, the self-absorbed whiner going on about his age-and-money worries dropping his shorts and agreeing in a loud voice how important two-way communication is between people after monologuing for the whole scene; or a John who is truly infatuated with her and often talks and doesn't have to have sex with her, you become part of this world as Sasha is able to listen and twist some strands of his hair, communicating ""I'd like to think so"" as he says he finds their relationship special. And within that world it works so perfectly, for she really IS what they want her to be for that ""time.""  Perhaps it's something within many men along the lines of King Solomon's 200 wives and 800 concubines that we desire a woman to love for an hour, a day a weekend. The emotional demands and sacrifices necessary for the ""committed relationship"" appear to be both alive and suddenly non-existent for Sasha, the Escort, but then Soderberg and Sasha bring the point home at the end like shrapnel flying together in reverse to become the whole bomb. The fact that the linchpin of the couple's undoing is something as neurotically hyper-personal as some kind of astrological nonsense is so perfect a counterpoint to the sophisticated clothing, lingerie and lifestyle enjoyed.  She doesn't see where she really is in life, and decides her bf's refusal to allow what amounts trangely enough , to be a type of ""adultery"" within their 'rules,' she merely says 'he's not supporting her."" Her girlfriend who she bounces things off mentions the ""boundaries"" of the John-relationship within that ""special moment"" experienced with someone new. The boyfriend nails what is going on perfectly (How's that for unusual in today's 'man-is-always-stupid' crowd?), but Sasha insists she has to ""find out for herself,"" tells the bf he's selfish;  only to experience the truth, but then - i was a lil lost here- she travels back to the guy who stood her up for his sudden emotional commitment to his family - and he's still there (???) and she does what the ""reporter"" is alwasy asking her to do: Be ""real."" So she pours out her agony over this really terrible message-board person.
Surprisingly, he listens sympathetically, suggesting a walk. So when she ""showed a crack of her real-self"" she was at first ""screwed,"" and ruins her ""real"" love-life, but then there's some kind of hint of (at least) survival at the end of that. Altho the point made is pretty obvious: Normally, you do not pay a girl $2,000 to hear her whine or cry.
I think there's a great artistic statement in the lack of the salacious as Sasha occasionally simply becomes a girl in her bra and panties. Not a sex goddess leaving you breathless with provocative poses and sexy come-ons, just a person who's there to be your girlfriend.
It is a RARE for me that I watch a movie twice in 24 hours, but I succumbed to another viewing quickly (the uncut version off the SPecial Section of the DVD (non Blue-Ray).
What made it even more impressive in its impact on me was I was able to filter out the left-wing chant over the economy. I'm a very committed anti-communist, and to hear the constant theme of ""how terrible the economy is"" was very grating as Soderbergh repeatedly gave these Monica Lewinskies to Obama for the coming election. I usually stop the movie when the ""Sieg Heils"" of the Left become too intrusive. Read my Invictus review and see. But Sasha and Soderberg won me over completely.",1277251200,4,4111,4.762973352033661
3863513,3,B0027BOL46,"""The Girlfriend Experience"" presents us with a call-girl's-eye view of the current economic recession (just in case you were wondering how that niche demographic is coping with the crisis).  Chelsea (real name Christine) is an upscale Manhattan escort whose wealthy clients seem to spend more of their purchased time with her these days voicing their concerns about the economy and their own personal finances than engaging in passionate lovemaking.  The movie also focuses on Chelsea's own efforts to expand her clientele as she meets with web designers and advertisers and agrees to be interviewed by a journalist.  Chelsea is somewhat unique among the girls in her profession in that she has a committed boyfriend (Chris Santos), an up-and-coming personal trainer who, apparently, doesn't mind that the love of his life makes a living selling her body to other men.

""The Girlfriend Experience"" finds director Steven Soderbergh in one of those low-budget, independent-movie moods that seem to strike him every couple of years or so in between helming his usual lucrative blockbusters.  The movie it most resembles is his 2002 ""Full Frontal,"" as it, too, alternates between scenes shot in blurry focus and scenes shot in full-on crystalline clarity.

The greatest strength of the movie lies in the matter-of-fact way in which it deals with the logistics of the profession and the complications that arise when Chelsea breaks her own code by falling for one of her clients.  Sasha Grey, who plays Chelsea, is herself a real-life porn actress and she has obviously brought much of her own personal experience to bear on the role.  It's a bit of an emotionless performance at times, but that actually works in the context of the story that's being told.

Unfortunately, the screenplay by Brian Koppelman and David Levien frequently wanders off into incoherence - and while the discussions about the Obama/McCain 2008 presidential election and the subsequent stimulus package may make the film feel topical and relevant at the moment, they are sure to wind up dating it in the long run.

Still, the austere nature of the piece - interestingly, there is not a single sex scene in the entire movie - and of the style of filmmaking make it well worth seeing, flaws and all.",1276387200,,2268,5.040106951871658
3863514,5,B0027BOL46,"First go dig up Roger Ebert's review. He put it the movies in the way I cannot.
The GFE really shows side of men and their need to talk and be listened to. So much so that they are willing to pay for it. Just like haircuts, massages, trainers and others who listen for a small fee in the world today.
So is that Iron Door always going to be closed? For most, yes. Perhaps it explains the pornstar and rockstar hookups that seem so persuasive. Are these women taking their skills in listening up to get the best possible fun person they can?

My two questions are...
1) What is in the brown package that she opens at the end? It was a package that Chris got that Chelsea opens. The painting?
2) What are the books that Chelsea is finding so attached to?

""They want you to be what they want you to be.""
""If they wanted to be yourself, they wouldn't be paying you.""

3863516,3,B0027BOL46,"When I first read the synopsis of the movie, all I could think was ""Hey ! that's the short story I am writing"". The short story is half done. The movie is out on DVD now.

Steve Soderbergh's film making exemplifies the principle ""We do what we need to do so that we can do what we want to do"". One always gets the feeling that he never really wanted to make Ocean's 12 & 13. He would have been more content making movies like Traffic, Good German etc. This is a movie he wanted to make rather than one he needed to make. Shot in portable hi-def, it never feels like it was hastily put together. There is a sense of polish which could be associated with big budget productions.

Soderbergh doing a lot with little is no suprise. But Sasha Grey's performance was a huge surprise. People may know Ms Grey from her predominantly explict performances in porn movies. Here she portrays the detachment and vanity of the central character with an aloofness which is essential and frustrating.

Anyone who has heard/read Ms Grey in interviews understands that she is far more intelligent and perceptive than her age (21) would suggest. There have been adult actresses in the past who attempted to crossover to mainstream but with hardly any success. But I have a feeling Sasha Grey maybe the one to achieve it.",1266710400,,1301,4.527659574468085

3863519,1,B0027BOL46,"There exist a certain number of film makers out there whose every film draws fans like bees to honey. Unfortunately a more apt metaphor at times would be flies to...well you know. It doesn't make a difference what they churn out; they are hailed as the best and brightest there is. But for some reason the films they choose to make as their own personal films never seem to be greeted as well with the majority of the world as they are by the die hard fans and hoity toity press. Such is the case with THE GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE.

Director Steven Soderbergh has been responsible for such films as ERIN BROKOVICH, OCEAN'S ELEVEN/TWELVE/THIRTEEN and THE LIMEY. But he's noted among the elite as a director of artistic films and those are the ones they choose to hail while paying service to the more popular films. I read somewhere that this film was one Soderbergh wanted to make and that he was fond of. He should listen to producers who want him to make more commercial products.

THE GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE is the story of a young couple in New York. Chelsea (porn star Sasha Grey) is a high priced call girl who wants to invest her money in something long term. Chris (Chris Santos) is her boyfriend, a personal trainer looking to make bigger money and a stake in a gym. Both of them are looking to make more money or a way to make the money they do make go further.

Chelsea isn't your typical $2,000 a night call girl though (is there a typical $2,000 a night call girl?). Chelsea does whatever the client wants in a different way, providing them with a temporary closeness most don't get. She knows things about them, she talks about things that interest them, she makes sure they are involved in things that interest them, in short making herself a girlfriend. As the title says, she provides the girlfriend experience.

This gets her close to people who can offer her advice that she can use later on. Advice in money matters, clothing, locations and more. She uses this information to help her and her boyfriend move further up the ladder.

Okay, all this being said it sounds like this could be an interesting movie. Unfortunately it is far from it. The pacing of the film is slower than syrup left in the snow for several days. There is no linear timeline to this film and it doesn't work. That being said, no movie must move in a linear fashion to be good (see 500 DAYS OF SUMMER) but in something like this it would help. Or perhaps not. Even the pieces put together here seem boring.

Everyone talks as if they're having a casual conversation no matter what they talk about. Sex, business opportunities, new jobs, money, all in the most monotone of voices to be recorded. And everyone walks through life in this film the same way, as if they aren't all that interested.

The film seems as if someone just happened to have a camera on hand when people were talking about various items. Great for a documentary or when you have an interesting subject, but tedious when it comes to this film.

Blurbs on the cover to this DVD show praise from well known critics as well as for Sasha Grey's performance. I saw more acting from the somnambulist in the silent CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI than was evident here. I hope she does make more mainstream movies, I hope she does turn out to be a great actress. But based on this film I don't see it.

As for the critics who praise this film, their desire to promote films of artistic merit as opposed to entertainment value or escapism is obvious. There are great movies whose artistic merit is obvious while at the same time being entertaining. What's sad here is that we are told how wonderful the film is when it is actually one of the most boring things I've ever witnessed.

If you are a die hard porn fan who must own everything Sasha Grey does, then buy this movie. If you find this in a used rack for a price less than a bottle of Sominex, by all means buy it. It's guaranteed to make you fall asleep sooner than the pills will.",1263168000,18,3981,4.456043956043956
3863520,4,B0027BOL46,"The Bottom Line:

The Girlfriend Experience often feels experimental, like Steven Soderbergh is playing in his sandbox rather than making movies for the public (there's nothing wrong with this--such trifling by Tarantino brought us the hugely enjoyable Kill Bill duplex) but his offbeat and achronological film--aside from just being plain interesting--has a lot of interesting things to say about capitalism and is worth a watch.

3863521,2,B0027BOL46,"I have generally enjoyed Soderbergh's films - more so the smaller-scaled ones like Out of Sight, Solaris and Sex, Lies & Videotapes than the big budgeted fares.  This is, unfortunately, not one of his better efforts.  I won't rehash the plot - it's less of a plot than a series of vignettes, in any case.  But I do want to comment on the performance of the Sasha Grey which is competent but by no means stellar.  I suspect the praises she received from some critics have to do with the fact that she was an adult film star and one usually does not associate good acting (in the traditional sense of the word) with professionals in this field.  The film is beautifully shot, as is the norm of most of Soderbergh's work, but there just was not enough in the movie to keep me interested.  It might have worked better as a semi-documentary on the escort profeesional but not as a feature film.",1261872000,,889,4.423312883435583
3863522,3,B0027BOL46,"I was sucked in by the movie poster. I loved the picture of Grey with the big sunglasses looking down at what I thought would be cell phone (she was actually counting money). It could be in a history book 100 years from now illustrating our addiction to information and fashionably big shades in the early part of this century. That photo is literally worth 1,000 words. I'd read about Sasha Grey in Rolling Stone a few months back and I typically load my rental queue with the DVDs that are hard to find. Because of the short length (75 minutes), this has an MTV reality show feel to it. By the way, I avoid reality shows where the focus is on rich, young Californians and their problems. ""Girlfriend"" works for me though. We can learn a lot from people from different walks of life even when we don't share the same values.

Cinematically, the cityscape is as beautifully shot as Lost in Translation. Both movies share a lot of solitude. It is not as plotless as other reviews say but it does run out of sequence to pique your interest. Chelsea is mechanical but well played by Grey who seems to have hope for an acting career after porn.

If this spoils the movie for you, consider this a warning. Chelsea's clients seem to want her company for a wide range of reasons. Mostly they want someone to listen to them. Don't we all? I was most interested in the values dynamic between her real boyfriend and her career. Having been there (loving someone who is still playing the field), I was most intrigued by Chelsea's greed leading her to go off the meter with a client, losing both her boyfriend and the client (married) in the process. Off the meter or not, Chelsea went on a spending spree prior to the weekend getaway where the guy calls to apologize for his cold feet and abandons her. Chelsea's boyfriend (a personal trainer in a gym) seems more connected to his client's emotions than Chelsea is to hers. The boyfriend pitches the idea of saving money by buying a bigger block of workouts to a gym client while making references to their relationship lasting. He actually refers to the ""future"" of the relationship.

Try to get too much, and you'll spill the cart and have nothing. Try to own too little, and you're left alone as Chelsea's boyfriend was after getting increasingly possessive about her extracurriculars. In this year of cheaters getting scalded by scorned women (Steve McNair, Tiger Woods etc.) I was paying close attention. What I got out of it was this: Whether you put all your stock in one person, or many: you'd best always be prepared to be alone.

Looking at my queue list, this will remain one of the more memorable movies but I can't give it 4 stars because it's just too thin on content. In a more typical movie plot, Chelsea would have been faced with real danger and perhaps a third act would have her getting help or closure. Instead we see her have one awkward exchange after another with men who never made time to become socially... suave. Awkward conversations with quirky people seem to be a staple in modern indy films.

The protagonist is an empty-headed and silly escort, the character of her boyfriend lacks depth so the actor continually struggles with poor lines, there's no plot, and the technique of inter-leaving scenes from different periods in the timeline is only useful if it actually contributes to some development, which here it doesn't.  In short, watching paint dry would be a more productive use of time.  We learn nothing from this movie except that some people are prepared to make very dull and pointless movies.  Note to the people who made this shambolic effort: escorts aren't intrinsically interesting, any more than teachers or doctors or plumbers are intrinsically interesting.  Movies need some central theme in order to retain the interest of the audience and the only theme of this movie is that boredom can go on for a very, very, very long time.",1259884800,5,1033,4.953757225433526

This movie affected me. I wanted to know why someone so beautiful would want to be an ""escort."" And when I googled the actress, her porn films sound really disgusting - far worse than what she is doing in this movie. So I'm thinking that in real life, she was probably sexually abused by her stepfather. That's just my guess.

Her aloofness says to me that she was very hurt emotionally early in her life because she is now numb.

It's really sad because she could have just gotten into regular modeling and I'm afraid that she is using her life to promote pedophilia, even though I don't think she realizes that.",1258934400,,848,4.423076923076923
3863546,2,B0027BOL46,"Steven Soderbergh is an experimental director who's not afraid to take chances. He's directed mainstream movies and then he's dappled in the more obscure, independent cinema. The Girlfriend Experience is a film that falls into the latter category that is (oddly enough) written by David Levien and Brian Koppelman who together penned the script for another Soderbergh film...Ocean's Thirteen. Strange, right? Most of Soderbergh's independent efforts fly under the radar, but this one got a little more attention than usual because of his decision to cast the young, controversial adult-film star Sasha Grey in the lead role.

Grey plays a high-class escort who gives her clients ""the girlfriend experience,"" which is the one thing separating her from a hooker. Sometimes, with her clients, sex will not even be involved and instead she will simply go to dinner with them and listen to them talk...And get paid quite a bit for it. Later, she'll recount exactly what occurred with the client. Nothing about the plot of this film is linear and Grey isn't the only character in the film, but identifying the role others play in the overall scheme of the movie is nearly impossible.

The film basically begins with characters having endless conversations about how bad the economy is and when these conversations do eventually cease, people talk to Grey about her job and what it requires of her. Like the talk about the economy, this is equally uninteresting and uninformative. A few people have actually applauded this film for it's statement about the economy or it's study of Grey's character, but make no mistake about it...This is not a character study nor an inside look into the world of high-paid escorts. It comes off like the script was written by two people who had heard of escorts but didn't know much about them and tried to strain the limit of their knowledge about the subject.
I really didn't get the feeling that this was a social commentary either, no matter how much it tried to seem to be. Any social statement Soderbergh and/or the writers were trying to make is lost anyway and the film seems dated mere months after its release.

Now, people have complained about Sasha Grey's performance. I can neither praise nor criticize her performance as this role does not require much talent or acting ability. She is not given a character with emotional depth and, as such, is not required to convey much emotion. Truthfully, more of her emotions are probably on display in her other ""films."" She says her dialogue convincingly and that's really all her character is given is (meaningless) dialogue. In that sense, she's not bad...Soderbergh clearly saw something in her because it's clear she wasn't cast because of her previous ""performances."" While Grey does have some brief nudity in the 79-minute film and a very brief nude scene after the credits, you can see more of Grey by typing in her name on google without the safe search on.

I honestly expected to like The Girlfriend Experience. I read all the poor reviews of it and heard how ""boring"" it is and I typically find something admirable about it. Just because a film is boring doesn't mean it's NOT a good film...The Girlfriend Experience isn't incredibly boring, but it's NOT a good film. This film evoked no emotional response from me and is so bland and dull; it doesn't even inspire enough energy to express hatred for it. I mean, it's a film with hollow, empty characters and strange, inexplicably amateurish cinematography. It doesn't succeed as a parable of today's economic crisis and it certainly doesn't succeed as entertainment. It's a film so absent of admirable qualities, it's a wonder that Soderbergh didn't have his name removed from the credits.

I won't flat-out say ""I hate this movie"" for one reason...The Girlfriend Experience is one of those rare movies that fails on so many levels, you won't even express any severe distaste for it simply because you'll have completely forgotten you've watched it a few hours later.",1257984000,8,4014,4.931952662721893

My God, how can a film about a high class call girl be both boring and completely unsexy? If you want the answer, rent but do not buy this film and you'll quickly find out. By now, everyone knows that the star of this mess is a real life porn star and I have to say that I sincerely hope that her work is much better in that field since I don't see her having a chance in hell of doing anything legit. Don't get me wrong, she is quite pretty in a 90's Calvin Klein type of way (too skinny for my taste, but hey, not all porn girls can be Jenna Jameson),but she has all of the emotion of an answering machine on life support. As several other reviewers have stated, there are no sex scenes (kind of what one expects in a film about hookers and especially when that film stars a porn actress).
 Of course, not all of the fault is with Ms. Grey(which could also describe the mood of the film: grey, lifeless, no passion,etc).The other actors are almost nonexistent, except for the personal trainer/boyfriend who is so hammy he should come with a nonkosher stamp. The plot is lame: apparently this is supposed to be a social commentary on the current economic crisis and how the wealthy are feeling so pinched that they are forced to cut back on their hookers and personal trainers. Let me shed a tear here. The script was essentially scenes from MSNBC moneytalk headlines interspersed with Ms. Grey's bland chat about her designer clothes and New Age philosophy. We never get a sense of who she is or why she does what she does(and don't say for the money. Enough women have faced horrific situations without resorting to prostitution).The conflict is supposed to be about her going off on a weekend meeting with a client based mainly on their shared birthday and how trainer boy can't handle it. Here's a clue, guy: your chick has sex with other men all day and night! Why when it's only one man for 2 days does that freak you out? Also, we are told that she is a high class call girl, but never see any sign of what besides sexy business suits makes her so. She is not shown speaking multiple languages, debating philosophy, etc. Why pay so much for a Kate Moss wantabe?
 To close, this felt like an arty film written by someone who secretly likes porn and sex but is desperately seeking a way to justify his interest to the masses as ""intellectual"". Good, witty hooker dramas are not difficult to write; just look at Showtime's ""Secret Diary of a Call Girl"". That programme is funny, cute, well written, AND sexy. This was none of the above.

I have seen her interviewed on Tyra Banks and in real life she comes off the same way. The story could have been a lot better if say Natalie Portman of somebody who could really act was in her role. She tried and the director worked to her strengths, not having her talk too much but still...

Kudos to Soderbergh for making a movie about prostitution that's not the least bit sensationalistic.  Though one of the film's core concerns is the way working as an escort can make it difficult to have a regular relationship, this arises organically from the particular characters, without a hint of moralism.  In fact there's almost no sex in the movie, just a lot of talk about money, which feels right and is a deeper taboo anyway.

Given the lack of any explicit scenes, the casting of porn star Sasha Grey seems like a bit of a stunt.  Plenty of actresses could have handled the brief nudity, and plenty more could have delivered their lines with feeling.  Maybe she's giving a brilliant fake-naive performance, but it sure seems like Sasha Grey can't act.  Even this is not a problem, however, because everyone else in the movie can, so she comes off as stiff and distant which suits the character.

The disc contains an alternate cut of the movie.  Nothing profoundly different--just a slightly different choice of out-of-sequence edits, but for my money it's tighter than the theatrical release so I'm glad it got to see the light of day.",1255478400,,2013,6.257246376811594
3863551,3,B0027BOL46,"""The Girlfriend Experience"" is directed by Steven Soderbergh (Solaris, Sex, Lies and Videotape, Erin Brockovich). It's an intimate film about an young escort, Chelsea (Sasha Grey), filmed in a naturalistic, documentary style. This movie was filmed in New York on a modest budget of 1.3 million on an inexpensive RedOne camera. It's a quiet film that explores this girl's business and her surrounding life, including her boyfriend, Chris (Chris Santos). This isn't a dramatic story with a plot. It's has the appearance of a slice of life, or in this case, pieces of a life, or episodes, whose intent seems to be to humanize a mysterious profession. There isn't much nudity and the scenes are filmed discretely. We get the sense that this girl lives in a lonely, unexciting world servicing lonely men. She does live with a boyfriend whom she shares an intimacy with, but something is missing, and she evidently feels it, because she accepts a man's offer to spend the weekend together, even though her boyfriend warns her that this will mean the end of their relationship.

This film shares some attributes of Michelangelo Antonioni's films which often seem to represent sparse, and alienated views of urban society. With ""The Girlfriend Experience"" we gather together the little bits and pieces that make up the fragile existence of a human experience.",1254873600,7,1351,5.058295964125561
3863552,1,B0027BOL46,"Oh man, the dude that directed all those Oceans movies is doing a movie and the main actress is a PORN STAR!!!1; CUH-RAZY.

Not really, not at all, not one bit; it's a painfully boring, trite and forgettable waste of time. I've never been a big fan of Soderbergh, always considered him to be pretty much a vapid hipster doofus who feels it his call in life to champion independents films and then turn around and make some of the most mundane and insipid trash.

The porn chick is a hideous sight to behold; genuinely boring in appearance and execution of everything, even watching her walk is coma inducing. The few times, you can count them on one finger and only need 2 segments of said finger, she actually tries to convey some sort of emotion are laughable; this, my friends, is not a good thing.

What else? Yeah, what else? There is nothing else; the film is, predictably, told out of order. Nobody is worth noting in any regards, really.

This could have been ground breaking: 40 years ago.",1254528000,9,998,4.527777777777778
3863553,5,B0027BOL46,"Like many people I watched this because I was curious if a hardcore porn actress could actually translate to a non-porn movie.  I had also read some of the reviews of this movie when it came out, and descriptions of its unique, stylized presentation had me intrigued.  And I had read a few interviews with Sasha Grey; the discussions with her left me slightly captivated. So, last night, we put on a Disney for the kids in their room, locked them in, and put this on, fully expecting some provocative, salacious fare.  About five minutes into the film I realized that expectation was probably not going to be fulfilled.

Instead, I realized that this film was something entirely different.  Indeed, it is a stylized masterpiece. The subdued lighting, esoteric conversations, eclectic musical selections, contrasting New York City venues, and Sasha's monotonal descriptions of her dates collectively left me fully mesmerized.  Normally, ""stylized"" means lack of substance. But, here, we have something entirely new. Strange and beautiful lighting, weird camera angles, exotic locales, rarified people either deeply troubled or extremely accomplished....together all these inputs create an intoxicating glimpse into this young escort's world. There is a scene which has a street drummer's ecstatically hypnotic music as backdrop, and all night long I've had that rhythm pounding away in my head.  But most scenes are dreamy subdued.  In fact, one pervasive sighting is Sasha eating at restaurants.  She is stuffing food into her mouth with highly elevated manners and petite bearing, while engaging in intense and intelligent conversation.  She has her own issues when she is not helping others' with theirs.  She is genuine and decent, smart and motivated.  I just dig this woman.

This movie is sophisticated and important. I am confident that within a decade this will be recognized as a stone cinematic classic.  Yes, people who come to this with a fixed expectation of seeing lots of t&a will be disappointed.  It is really only PG-13 in that regard.  But, the dialogue here is amazingly realistic and intelligent.  How Soderbergh was able to get such natural, fluid, elaborate--and interesting--dialogue out of these people is just beyond me.  I was simply captivated by the conversations.  The ruined economy is a big point in these discussions--many of the clients are Wall Street types--and I think Soderbergh has done a brilliant job of capturing a certain perspective about this period of economic malaise in our national history.

The ""girlfriend"" Sasha portrays is fascinating.  The fact that she is a girlfriend to several different men--amazingly--does not detract from a palpable sincerity she brings to the table in each encounter.  She listens to her clients intently.  Her face reflects her reactions to each word they utter.  She thinks for an extended period before she responds, and she gives earnest, thoughtful, meaningful advice.  She is no one's fool, and although she is an escort, she brings legitimate empathy and support to her clients.  As one prospective client says to her: ""I was thinking of a psychiatrist or you, but you seem like you would be a lot more fun.""  She laughs at that, because she understands.

Sasha's escort is interested in upgrading.  She solicits advice from web-site people, and other advisors in the adult-services industry.  She wants to upgrade her reputation so she can increase her prices.  She is a connoisseur of fine lingerie and the other accoutrements of the bedroom, and she documents what she has worn on each encounter.  My wife did not fully appreciate it when I mentioned that I thought many women could learn a lot from Sasha's character, but I think she agreed.  Listening, empathy, lingerie.  The Feminine Power Trinity, perfectly exemplified here by Sasha.

I came away from this movie with great affection for Sasha's character, and respect for Sasha Grey.  No, I haven't seen any of her hardcore fare, but I'm going to remedy that as soon as possible.  If I were a film-maker I would definitely be looking at Sasha Grey, she is in the Natasha Kinski mold, but perhaps even a little more nuanced and exotic.  And Soderbergh is obviously going to have to fill the void left in my life from Kubrick's departure.  I just love the visions of the world that this man portrays.",1254528000,5,4344,5.0647887323943666
3863554,4,B0027BOL46,"I went into this knowing it was another one of his kind of style films so all of the complaints (there are tons out there) sound like people that were expecting something else. Everything about this exudes the melancholy and slice of normal life he films so eloquently, and in the end I got the questions answered about what he did with one of his few BD releases.

The clarity is excellent throughout. Even the indoor dark sequences are done with exceptional line detail and color; The candles floating in water during a restaurant scene looked perfect, body contours against windows or darkly lit rooms looked flawless, etc. The DTS offers only the nuanced and muffled sounds that Soderbergh does in his films, the narrations are quite dry so this isn't exactly a channel test. The nagging question has been what he did with this ""alternate"" version being included. Sitting through two versions of this in the same night to see essentially two differences is a tough sell, and in the end I think including them as alternate scenes would have been much better. The versions are 24 seconds in difference, and offer a brief difference in two of her encounters with clients. Sufficed to say, nothing worthy beyond the possibility of offending audiences with a q-tip (explaining it would mean the review will not get posted).

The supplement from HDNet is a forgettable ad plug lasting 4:37 minutes. The menu has a flawless picture rotation of Sasha looking content with a decent score background. A solid reference Blu (outside of the scenes he purposely makes to look grainy/poor) but the content style makes it about as unpopular as can be read about here.",1254182400,2,1656,4.827464788732394
3863565,5,B0027BOL46,"This is kind of an odd film to review, partially because it's such a singular film, which is probably why most (newspaper, film critic) reviews focused soley on it being a commentary on the economic crisis.

The writer/director of the film, Steven Soderbergh is best known for his ultra-successful and stylish works like ""Ocean's 11"" (the Clooney/Pitt one) or maybe the more mainstream award winner ""Traffic.""  But in between doing these studio pics, Soderbergh does some truly original, sometimes downright experimental films like ""Schizopolis"" and ""The Limey.""  The latter of his work is best suited to arthouse crowds, and even they will have mixed reactions.

I thought this was a brilliant film--it's exceedingly ambitious, stylistically suave, and thematically dense.

There's not really a plot per se, and the timeline is jumbled, but for the sake of simplifying it, we'll say that it follows a high class call girl played by real-life adult mega-star Sasha Grey over the course of 8 days, just before the Obama/McCain election.  Non-linear plots are a dime a dozen these days, and so rarely do I see it done effectively and meaningfully (""Memento"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" being two familiar standouts.)  It seems rather haphazard at first, but by the time you're done, it's really quite an ingenious structuring.

Sasha Grey is either good at taking direction, has trouble emoting, or is a good actress--the world may not know until she does something else (besides porn.)  Her performance is affectless, but it fits so well with the character (and is even referenced in the film) that I don't know whether to credit Soderbergh, Grey, or both for this suitable performance.  (P.S.  This is not a ""sexy film."")

While the economy is the threaded theme throughout, the film touches on so many different issues, poses so many questions...it's so DENSE, it reminds of a late Godard film, as shot in a clinically Kubrick style.

That said, I would not suggest this film to 99% of the people I know, because most people (so I've heard) found it plotless, pointless, dull, random, disjointed, messy, etc.

But if you're a fan of avante-garde/abstract/utterly original cinema, give this film at least a rent (it's only about 78 minutes long) or check out some of Soderbergh's more adventurous work.  To the right viewer, the girlfriend experience is well worth the ""asking price.""

***Note:  The alternate version, in the bonus section, on the blu-ray (don't know if it is on DVD) is an even better cut than the amazing original, at two minutes shorter, a few extra scenes and visuals, all in wonderful HD.",1249430400,35,2601,4.997679814385151
3863566,4,B0027BOL46,"While not for everyone, this is an excellent movie (in my opinion).  The title refers to the hope/expectation of clients of call girls, but the same fantasies and hopes are part of the life of the main character, a high-class call girl.  She thinks she is sophisticated (wears La Perla), but she is naive and easy prey of manipulative people.  Some consider this a comedy, and it is indeed ironic, but I found it sad, even tragic.  For comparison, I consider these human-interest movies to be 4-5 stars: Running on Empty, House of Games, Garden State, Closer, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.",1247961600,2,595,4.747572815533981
3863567,1,B0027BOL46,"If you like Sasha Grey because she's a adult film star, this film will leave you cold. If you like movies that are compelling and make sense, this film will leave you really cold. Sasha Grey is very pretty and she looks great without clothes, which is why she's an adult film star. As an actress, she has a long way to go--but she outshines everyone else in ""The Girlfriend Experience"" by a country mile. If you're looking for nudity, there's very little (one brief scene of her walking in the nude). And there are no sex scenes.
The story of ""The Girlfriend Experience"" is disjointed and idiotic. None of the characters are that interesting or enjoyable. It seems like Soderbergh wanted to ramble about the failing economy and needed to add some sex to the screed to make it marketable. Sasha Grey's character is a highly paid escort whom everyone seems to want to treat badly in some way. Everyone else is talking about the economy. Even Sasha asks her clients about the economy. Thankfully, this film clocks in at far less than 90 minutes--though it seems much longer because it's so boring and self-indulgent.
If you like Sasha Grey, do what I did and buy some of her adult films on Blu-Ray instead of having anything to do with this rotten excuse for a movie.",1247529600,9,1264,4.572687224669603
3863568,1,B0027BOL46,"While some may praise the works of Steven Soderbergh, this film is one of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. Sasha Grey delivers a cardboard performance which lacks the depth necessary for the role of a prostitute. Her connection to the adult entertainment industry built buzz for the film, but her performance is nothing special. The movie focuses more on people talking about the economy than holding a cohesive narrative and its jumpy plot line is a disaster. My advice is to not waste your money on the product when there are plenty of other drama films which deserve attention. If you want a more accurate examination of human condition and relationships, check out Marc Webb's 500 Days of Summer.",1247184000,10,726,4.816

I found it boring and the ""acting"" not as good as some of the stuff I've seen on community access.  It was like watching a dead pan comedy, except it's not comedy and there are no jokes.

3863570,5,B0027BOL46,"I really enjoyed this movie, and I found it to be an interesting look into a world that not everyone experiences.  It's more of a slice of reality out of a believable, interesting, hypothetical life than it is your standard Hollywood flick--which makes sense, as it's an independent film.

I also enjoyed Sasha Grey's portrayal of her character, and I found her to have good acting skills and to be likable.  I was rather impressed with her here.

Further, while some have noted that there isn't much nudity, this is quite true.  There is some, but I feel that it would have taken away from the film had it just focused around sex scenes, etc.  I found the level of nudity / sex (relatively minimal) to work quite well here.

Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in seeing a snippet of reality quite different from their own, to anyone who is interested in Ms. Grey, and / or to anyone who is interested in a bit of a break from the norm in terms of their movie watching.",1246752000,8,1000,4.4316939890710385
3863571,4,B0027BOL46,"The sole intent of a business is to provide a commodity for the consumer. A young escort named Chelsea (Sasha Grey) is herself a commodity for rich men who, for all intents and purposes, want the same basic thing: Companionship. Some want to go to the movies. Many want to wine and dine her at pricey restaurants. Sex can be involved, but according to what we're shown, Chelsea's clients are much more interested in airing their financial grievances and persuading her to vote in specific ways during the 2008 Presidential campaign. They also seem quite fascinated with the idea of discovering the ""real"" Chelsea, which is probably why they often ask her so many questions about what she does for a living. But is it possible to ""know"" her? As she says, ""If they wanted to know the real me, they wouldn't be paying."" For an escort, it's not about reality, but about creating the illusion of reality.

Steven Soderbergh's ""The Girlfriend Experience"" operates on complex but relatable notions of humanity, specifically how money can be such a motivating factor. Neither Chelsea nor her clients delude themselves into believing that theirs is a lasting relationship. Indeed, her cool attitude and monotone voice make it clear that it's all about making a transaction and nothing more. She claims to be an escort in a committed relationship, but judging by the way she regards her boyfriend of a year and a half, Chris (Chris Santos), the idea is open for debate; Chris is a personal trainer, and like Chelsea, he wants to be successful at what he does. Do they love each other? Who knows? They live together, but there's never a moment of passion or even basic friendliness. Even when they argue, there's no conviction in what they say to one another.

There may, in fact, be only one client she's willing to pursue at a more personal level. He's not like the others. He actually listens. He's miles apart from the operator of an escort reviewing website, who was willing to write her a good review in exchange for sex. Chris doesn't exactly fit into this scenario, which is ironic since he's her actual boyfriend while her clients are merely paying to pretend to be her boyfriend. They pay for a Girlfriend Experience while Chris gets it for free. Then again, maybe he doesn't; he's offered the chance to join a group of friends for a guys-only weekend in Las Vegas, and considering his relationship with Chelsea, it's easy to understand why he decides to go.

What this movie does so well is reveal character without making it obvious. It's not so much in the dialogue but in the actions and subtle mannerisms. Chelsea, thin and tall with long dark hair, is both beautiful and irresistibly mysterious. She's dedicated and competitive, and we occasionally watch her take notes about her latest date--what she wore, who the clients were, what they did, what they said, etc. More to the point, she knows how to make herself seem interesting to the opposite sex, and she's darn good at making them feel important. She will listen to them talk, and she will respond when appropriate. She will do these things because providing a Girlfriend Experience is her job.

The challenge for the audience is to discover this while working through the film's experimental style. Scenes are played out of sequence. The structure doesn't have a traditional beginning, middle, and end. The dialogue seems almost entirely adlibbed, which is to say that there are a lot of interruptions and moments of hesitation. It was shot with a RedOne camera, which gives the whole thing the look and feel of a documentary. And yet, once the pieces fall into place, we realize that it's been telling us a deceptively simple story, not one of love or happiness but of basic human nature. We go through life knowing we're good at something, and at a certain point, we must provide our services with the rest of the world for a fee. Sasha Grey is the perfect actress to convey this message, given her background in pornography, another business that makes money by creating illusions.

Movies in general are about creating illusions, just as much as they are about providing them to audiences. ""The Girlfriend Experience"" understands this, which is why I was able to buy into the illusion. It's an unconventional but highly intriguing slice of life about people, not merely a story about characters. We're being asked to watch, and I don't mean we have to keep our eyes on the screen--we really have to watch everything that's going on, from the way shots are set up to what the shots are supposed to reveal. We have to pay close attention to what everyone is saying, not merely because it's important but also because what they say sounds as natural as actual conversing. We have to invest in Chelsea despite the fact that she presents only what her clients want her present. Like the men in her life, we try to discover the ""real"" her while knowing all too well that such a thing isn't possible. The pleasure of her company isn't personal. It's strictly business.",1245801600,34,5028,4.7680826636050515
3863572,3,B0027BOL46,"I'll tell you why-- because Sascha Grey is an adult actress.  I guess it's a big deal that she can actually do other types of work.  The problem is she gives a mediocre performance at best.  It's dull, lifeless, and has no heart.

I've seen better acting on YouTube.  And it's not just Sasha, but the entire cast.  This is way low budget, like something an NYU student would do.

With that said, there is some entertainment in watching a train wreck, so if that is what you like, go for it.",1245196800,3,490,4.260869565217392
3863573,3,B0027BOL46,"The film has received a lot of buzz for casting 21-year-old porn star Sasha Grey as the lead in this film about the life of a high priced NYC escort that takes place over a few days leading up to the 2008 Presidential election. Guys out to see Grey in a Hollywood sex scene will be sorely disappointed as there are exactly zero such scenes and the film only has a few brief moments of nudity. In fact this film as much concerned with showcasing the worries over our nation's current economic crisis as it is in examining the life of someone who sells intimacy (not just sex) for a living.

This film will not be everyone's cup of tea; it's definitely an indie arthouse film. It also has a jumpy narrative timeline that can make discerning what happened when and who said what to whom a bit confusing. The film also has a very distinct and bland feel about it--no showy shots of NYC skylines or glitzy nightclubs. Even when characters are zipping to Vegas on private jets or going on expensive shopping sprees it's shown in a very ordinary, non-glamorous way. I feel director Steven Soderbergh likely cast Grey for this sort of detached blandness in her demeanor rather than her acting prowess. In fact Grey's most dramatic scene in the film--in which she ends a committed relationship with her long-time personal trainer boyfriend--her entire body is obscured on camera by a sofa. This is another effort to show how Grey's character isn't really a part of her own facile life. Soderbergh also cast a real magazine writer as a journalist that interviews Grey's character and an actual film critic as a man who runs an Internet message board that reviews high priced escorts. I believe he did all this to further emphasize the banality of the escort's lifestyle which so many people seem to be fascinated with and our media never fails to glamorize, dramatize and exploit.

But capturing facileness on film doesn't make for an especially entertaining movie going experience. Most people would much rather have their time spent watching Julia Roberts in ""Pretty Woman"" than the stark reality of Sash Grey's recession era escort. We'd much rather pay to see a movie that let's us escape from the truth than pay to see a film that shows us the plain truth.",1244419200,2,2251,4.681818181818182

It was like the editor took a bunch of filmstrips and threw them in the air and whatever he picked up first he put together.  The cinematography was passable but wasn't memorable.  The acting as a whole was mediocre and expressionless at best..sorry but miss Grey needs to keep her day(?)job and not worry about doing anything on the legit side of filmmaking again until she has training.  The movie on the surface is supposedly about her relationship with her boyfriend in conflict with her vocation and one client in particular- a brief but unsuccessful attempt at cheating in her relationship which was in itself tenuous at best with a client turned(in her mind)into more but there was never any offering of continuing plot that made any sense..I reacted to the ending by thinking uh maybe they're going to show some credits and intersperse the rest of the scene and go to the conclusion of her boyfriend quandary with some solution but it just quit like a car stalling.  I like artsy films when they work and I really like some of mr Soderberghs works but in my opinion this was one not worth the time spent watching.,1244332800,7,1289,4.606986899563319

This isn't just the story of a call girl, it's really about loneliness, disconnectedness and the commodification of everything in the modern world, including love.

I came in interested because of Sasha Grey and her pornstar backstory but in all honesty her cool factor wore off quickly and what we are left with is a disaster. The girl has about as much personality as a rock and can almost act as good as one. This is a sad attempt at what could have been a great flick had casting done a much better job.,1241654400,9,488,3.8415841584158414

8354404,3,B0027BOL46,"The Girlfriend Experience is kind of a diary of a call girl and her real boyfriend.  To the extent there is a story to it, it jumps between the girlfriend (played by Sasha Grey) trying to market herself and being interviewed by a writer, and her boyfriend trying to get his personal training business to expand during the height of the financial crash before the 2008 election.

The story jumps around a lot, and is not told in anything that resembles a beginning to end timeline.  There are themes to the movie for sure, but they are not always overt and hitting the audience over the head.  It has a very minimal soundtrack and is much like watching a very highly produced documentary following these people around.  The writing and acting are decent, but not great.  But the point of the movie was not to have a highly developed storyline, but to show moments.  It basically cuts between the interview scenes, to those of her boyfriend, to her interactions with her clients.  It is not overtly sexual at all in terms of a lot of nudity and sex scenes.  You mostly see the lead up and aftermath of the sex, but no real sex scenes at all.  I think that actually worked for what the movie was going for.

For those who get the disc, it looks great on blu ray.  Regardless of what you think of the story or acting, the visuals of NY that you get throughout the movie are very good and really pop on blu ray.  For extras there is a good commentary track on the film with Grey and Sodergberg, what amounts to a trailer for the film, and an alternate cut that really amounts to having one extended scene.  Not a lot, but okay for what is there.

It is definitely not a movie that will be everyone's cup of tea.  As you can see the reviews are pretty mixed.  I am kind of in the middle.  Did not think it is the greatest movie ever, but did not hate it either.  It is very short, and just under an hour and 20 min and never seems like it drags on.  I think it is worth checking out, but not necessarily someone everyone will watch multiple times.",1471996800,,2041,4.2793733681462145
