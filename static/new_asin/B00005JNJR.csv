1522335,5,B00005JNJR,"The best horror movies unsettle your everyday life, lingering after the closing credits, hiding behind closed doors and darkness, and generally making you afraid to turn off the lights.  ""Ju-on"" is particularly skilled in this, leaving the sensation that every single spot out of your immediate rang of vision is occupied by some eerie blue ghost with penetrating eyes.

The story, that of a cursed and haunted house that kills everyone who enters it, is told in non-chronological fragments much in the style of ""Pulp Fiction.""  Slowly, the story unfolds of a wife's murder by her jealous and suspecting husband, who then commits suicide.  Her vengeful spirit curses the house, absorbing the spirits of those who dare to live there or even enter at all.  The first to fall under her spell is her own son, Toshio, who becomes her companion in the grudge.  As the film goes on, she is joined by many others.

Aside from the fragmented story, what separates ""Ju-On"" is that the director Takashi Shimizu has utilized the space of the Japanese house to its fullest effect, drawing out the essential spookiness in its architecture in much the same way Kubrick's ""The Shinning"" found the horror in the grand hotel. Packed with tight corners, steep staircases, deep closets and attics, and doors on every room, the Japanese home is a maze of unseeable spaces.  Everything is out of your field of vision, and Shimizu has accentuated this effect by tightening the camera view, removing all peripheral vision for a claustrophobic and tense effect.  If you happen to live in a Japanese house, I can guarantee that you won't climb your stairway as confidently again, or peek up into your crawlspace.

Working from a small budget, Shimizu has also created a ghost-effect that unnerves without relying on expensive special effects or gore.  The simplicity of the imagery magnifies the sense that this is taking place in the real world, rather than the film world or Hollywood.

The pacing of the story is patient, reflecting Japanese sensibilities of storytelling.  Also, the complete story is never told, and the viewer is expected to see the story beneath the surface, connecting the dots without having all of the information handed to them.  This can be a bit trying to American viewers used to more active storytelling, and I am sure that the American re-make will fill in the blanks in the same way it did with ""Ringu.""  There is no ""why"" behind ""Ju-On.""  There is merely an angry ghost, her victims, and a deep and lasting grudge.",1098316800,15,2522,4.871194379391101
1522336,4,B00005JNJR,"Ok, so the female ghost is similar to the ghost that crawled out of the TV in The Ring and there might be some similarities to other fantastic Japanese horror films (the elevator scene brings Dark Water to mind) but Ju-On stands on its own as a creepy masterpiece of nightmarish horror.

When I rented this from the local video store my copy would not allow me to set English subtitles.  It was late and I didn't feel like walking back to the store so I watched Ju-On in Japanese.  Even though I could only gather the bare gist of the story Ju-On is so full of visual style and creepy sound effects it scared me so much I was afraid to go to bed (the bed scene is probably the creepiest scene in the entire film).

Rika, a social worker, goes to check in on an old woman whose previous social worker has disappeared.  She finds the woman glassy eyed and speechless and realizes the other inhabitants of the house are missing.  Soon after Rika has her first encounter with the ghosts and passes out.  We flashback to the married couple who lived there, a sister and the old woman.  Slowly we discover the horror that led to the old women being left alone.  Rika comes to and the real horror begins.

Anyone who enters the house where the ghosts have died disappears within hours. Told in separate vignettes we learn what happens to each person who disappears.  This creates a slowburn effect where each scene builds upon the last scene until a climax of horrific nightmarish terror occurs only to start over again with the next character. Hitomi's story is the creepiest of the bunch although they're all creepy. The film comes together as a whole and is even better the second time around.

I really enjoyed this film immensely and finally had the opportunity to see it subtitled.  A creepy horror film simply meant to scare and boy does it ever!  If the recent remake, The Grudge, is even half as good as this Hollywood is going to have a genuinely scary horror flick on their hands.",1098057600,10,1984,4.475
1522337,1,B00005JNJR,"This is one of the crappiest movies I have ever seen. To think that a little boy dipped in talcum powder with a bit of eye liner and mascara would be scary....well...I think NOT!! The entire plot is repetitive and boring and by the end of it, you are just waiting and wanting everyone to die because they are all just so lame.  The only highlight of the show is the end credits because you can finally turn the tele off.  The film works more as a sedative than an adrenalin rush. I give it the big THUMBS DOWN!!!",1097798400,5,512,4.161616161616162
1522338,1,B00005JNJR,"The selling point of The Grudge was the story was written by the same minds behind the ever scary The Ring. However, apart from certain similarities that you could find from The Ring, The Grudge is far from satisfactory and mediocre.

The story is about an curse / grudge that prevails in a haunted house that caused every single person who had visited that house to disappear through a haunted experience. The idea is good but at the same time reminds people of the serial video of The Ring. It is also because of this that makes the story less convincing. The video in The Ring is more mobile so it could affect more innocent people could be understood, but the way in The Grudge to make people visitng that house and then snatched by the dark force is just really unconvincing.

The movie started off pretty good with normality turned haunting but then as the reel rolls on, you only feel that it is too repetitive and you already expect those people to end in a scary experience, which because of the expectation, it is hardly scary anymore. The Ring and Dark Water made themselves into the classic list because of their great imagination and tension building. The Grudge simply lacks that completely. When you watch it you just feel that the story is repeating itself again and again and you get tired and fed up with the story. Also the characters are not characters you care about anymore as everyone only constitutes a small part and their stories are not appealing enough to capture your care and sympathy towards them.

Another failure of the movie is the similarity of the killer ghose to The Ring, which gave you the feeling of ""oh not again"". Basically people behind the Grudge should employ more imagination over the whole story to make it more interesting. The lack of tension and lack of coherent of the story, together with the unnatural marriage of different stories together contributed a lot to the failure of the story.

The Ring and Dark Waters are classcial thriller that make you want to watch again but still feel scared. However, for The Grudge, it just didn't make it. It is just another Japanese ""scary"" movie.",1097625600,7,2138,4.648148148148148
1522339,5,B00005JNJR,"Simply put, this first theatrical (and third film in the 'Ju On' series) is the stuff of nightmares. There is imagery here that will keep you awake for weeks.

It's arguably the weakest film in the series...but it still delivers scares the likes of which U.S. audiences have never seen before. I hope Lion's Gate puts out the other three 'Ju On' films soon.",1097452800,10,357,4.578125
1522340,5,B00005JNJR,"Finally after a long wait, North America sees the release of ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" on DVD, no doubt meant to coincide with the American remake called ""The Grudge"" starring Sarah Michelle Gellar which will be released in theatres this fall.  Ju-On belongs to the cream of the crop of J-Horror, perhaps the best spooky house horror movie I have ever laid eyes on.  Brilliantly directed by Takashi Shimizu, Ju-On is an unrelenting spectacle of spooky sights and sounds that manages to outcreep even the likes of ""Ringu"" and the Pang Brothers' ""The Eye"" without even a drop of blood spilt.  Interestingly enough, the American Studio responsible for the remake has decided to enlist the services of Shimizu himself to direct the remake and to set the action in Japan alas with a mostly American cast.  The remake will have a very tough act to follow if it whishes to outspook the original, however this has been achieved before with ""The Ring"".

The prologue shows us what led to the house becoming haunted; a man who believes his wife had an affair kills her in an uncontrolled rage then kills himself.  The couple's young son, who witnesses the savage act, disappears and is never to be seen again.  Fast forward several years: the house is now inhabited by the Tokunaga family of three, a husband and wife and the husband's old frail mother.  While husband and wife are away on a trip, the nearby welfare center sends volunteer social worker Rika to look after the house and the old mother.  While cleaning the house, she witnesses ghostly apparitions that drive her away from the house.  Soon after, when the tenants of the house return from their trip they too are terrorized by the vengeful spirits of the dead family.

Several factors are responsible for making ""Ju-On"" such an utterly scary film.  Director Shimizu for one is a master at building intensity in a scene through the use of rising ominous music and creepy visuals.  But the way he does it is very unique.  In the vast majority of haunted house movies, it usually involves one character seeing a supernatural entity and then said supernatural entity disappearing before anyone else can see it therefore making the witness appear crazy.  Not here.  The ghosts here can be seen by ALL no matter what, making them seem all the more dangerous and frightening.  Also, the viewer is always kept on edge since the ghost of the little boy keeps appearing in all sorts of unexpected places like in windows, mirrors and myriad reflections and corners of the screen.  And then there is the house, this is just a regular-looking house in a suburb, giving the film an element of realism seldom seen in these types of movies.  I find that setting the events in your average suburban house is a much more effective scare tactic since after all how many of us have ever lived or visited a giant gothic mansion?  This hits much close to home.

Ju-on weaves a complex storyline with numerous continuity jumps and gaps that give it a certain Lynchian feel.  Those continuity jumps are very confusing for the first-time viewer (Huh, does Rika die twice?) but it's also one of the things that makes the film stand so well to repeat viewings because it does make sense the second time around.  Which is not to say the film is without its problems.  Although I found very few flaws with the execution of the film, certain things simply don't make much sense such as the spirits following people in places outside of the house and also if the house is history to so many people dying of fright because of ghosts how come new tenants keep moving in?  It must have a very convincing real estate agent looking after it!  Still, minor misgivings for a tremendous horror film.  As for the remake I'll welcome it with open arms; many on the internet have addressed resistance about the casting of Gellar as the central character.  I for one believe she'll be fabulous.  This is a role where looking scared is of paramount importance and Gellar has shown us time and time again in Buffy how convincingly she can put a frightened face on.  And besides with original director Shimizu at the helm, what could possibly go wrong?",1095552000,48,4156,4.684573002754821
1522341,4,B00005JNJR,"Juon has recently been remade for American screens as ""The Grudge,"" and stars Sarah Michelle Gellar. This is one of many parallels one might draw between this movie and ""Ring,"" which was remade with Naomi Watts and has spawned an entirely american sequel.

The vengeful ghost trapped in an item or location is a very common theme in Japanese horror and storytelling. Films like Juon and Ring, as well as games such as Fatal Frame (PS2) feed off the fears inherent in the stories of vindictive undead. One main difference between the Japanese and American versions of these is the degree to which our fear can be assuaged with some sort of explanation. Juon, like the original Ring, offers vague hints as to what happened to its ghosts and what does happen to their victims. The ending offers no explanation, no enlightement, and might be unsatisfying to some viewers. Interestingly enough, it is that lack of resolution that makes this genre so strong and helps it leave a lasting impression. There may be no solution to the ghost problem. The evil unleashed may be unstoppable.

The movie is somewhat slow, especially compared to the horror flicks we're used to, which doesn't mean its characters don't fall into the usual victim traps (like being unpardonably dumb). There's no obvious violence to speak of and none of the detective fiction element that has strengthened some other scary films. However, if you enjoy the slow building of a subtle and chilly atmosphere, and are prepared to be scared without reprieve, you will really appreciate this movie.",1094860800,22,1558,4.920152091254753
1522392,4,B00005JNJR,"If you liked the American version (the grudge) then you'll probably want to get this original version.

1522395,4,B00005JNJR,"Just as scary as I remembered it. The movie was insanely scary throughout, and it really helped to define the haunted house subgenre of horror. The ending sort of ticked me off, as the big ""twist"" ending showcased something I had thought had been made clear throughout the entire movie. However, it wasn't a bad ending. I just don't think it was as climactic as the creators might have been hoping. One of the scarier movies I've seen recently.",1471996800,,444,4.632911392405063

There even is a hidden ""Easter Egg"" on the ""Deleted Scenes"" pg, which is adorned with the image of Ms Sachie (the terrified old woman) sitting outdoors: directly beneath the ""Special Features"" print is a white-lidded cup lying on its side, an X shape on the lid. If you scroll down with your remote, the lid will turn black and when you click on it, a ""Turn Off The Lights In Your Room And Enjoy"" audio feature is displayed.

1522476,4,B00005JNJR,"Ju-on isn't as scary as I once thought when I first watched the film over 10 years ago.  It seems more evident now that there's just a little boy in a costume hiding in a house and occasionally frightening Megumi Okina's character, as well as the old lady who lives there and the man (boyfriend?) who drops boy.  I'm not sure if it was ever stated why Megumi is there.  Perhaps to take care of the unusually quiet older lady.

With that said, I'm still rating the movie highly because there's one scene that's AMAZING!  It's when the lady who's working the night hours at the office takes a walk to the bathroom and hears someone making creepy voices in the phone.  She gets terrified and a moment later a huge dark figure appears from behind one of the stalls!  She runs out of the room, returns to her office terrified and asks the security guard to go check it out.  She sees the security guard on camera being overwhelmed by the dark figure as he stands in front of the bathroom door soon after the TV signal starts to get static-y.

The woman immediately takes off running home.  While at home she picks up the phone and hears the same kind of moaning/creepy voices that she heard while at work.  She throws the phone outside her apartment home door in fear, runs back inside the room and hides under the sheets.  She makes a fatal mistake in turning the TV on a moment later.... only to see the same kind of suspicious signal loss that she saw on the security camera (with the face of the newswoman on TV changing shapes before the TV shuts off, which was awesome).  She hides under the covers shaking... and then a bubble forms at the back of her bed under the sheets... and it's a little creepy demonic boy who's come to kill her!  This is about 5-8 minutes of REALLY good writing!

The rest of the film is just okay.  Megumi sticks around the house seeing the creepy boy way more than she should since his constant presence sort of reduces the scare factor, but at least when he appears it's usually during surprising moments.  The way he slithers down the stairs near the end is hair-raising in an Exorcist kind of way.  Of course if you look at such a scene for what it is, it's just a creepy boy crawling down the stairs with dramatic music making it scarier.  But I don't like to be a total party pooper, so I think this whole segment is pretty good.  I do think the little boy meowing was too much though.

Pretty good atmosphere and acting, but the scares aren't as memorable as I thought they'd be.  The Grudge is probably a better film (as you know the Grudge is a remake of this) but only slightly.  The Grudge doesn't have a REALLY scary scene like the one I describe above however.  So overall Ju-on is a good film, expect to read subtitles which isn't a big deal to me, and enjoy a pretty decent Japanese horror film.",1445126400,,2838,4.341555977229602

1522726,3,B00005JNJR,"I first got into horror films from across the pond when I was about 12 or so.  One of the first movies I recall seeing was Ju-On, a film that creeped me out to no end.  I told all of my friends about the movie, and they too agreed this movie was incredibly effective at dishing out scares.

Flash forward all these years later and I saw the movie pop up on Amazon's instant streaming service (which is getting better and better!).  I was excited to relive the memories I had when I was younger.  To be frank, this time I didn't find a single scare to be had in Ju-On.  That may not be a bad thing, it just means this movie is probably way more effective for a younger audience (between 7-14 is probably a good range).  The only scene that is even slightly disturbing is the opening scene, implying a double murder. After that there's not an ounce of blood spilled, a curse word uttered, or any kind of adult content too intense for kids.

Adults may find Toshiio, the boy ghost, prancing across the hallway, hiding in the closet and making cat noises more amusing than creepy.  More effective is the girl ghost, but even she may induce laughter when they show close-up shots of her eyes.  In the end, a big mistake the director made was showing too much of the ghosts too soon.  One aspect that makes ghosts creepy is when they are unseen, hiding in the dark, and in Ju-On they are out in the open too much.

That's not to say Ju-On is a bad movie, however.  The set pieces inside the house are incredibly creepy, and the characters are all likeable, which is rare in modern horror.  The story is also interesting, and I love how it ties the curse to all the principal characters in the movie.  The movie is still a horror classic, notorious enough for an American remake made by the same director.  Just temper your expectations if you're not a teenager anymore.",1357948800,,1863,4.356521739130435

As a consumer, if you have already seem many progressive horror films, especially of Eastern varieties, you may find Ju-on to be a very predictable affair. Although it's credited with having created many of these scare tactics and creative atmospheres, it's a bit dated now.

I would also like to mention that Ju-on 2 is very good as well, and that DID surprise me on multiple shocking moments, more so than Ju-on.

Ju-On is a scary movie that brilliantly blends many horror elements together; as you watch Ju-On, you'll see some creepy imagery, like the pale Toshio, you'll hear the iconic screeching phone call, and feel the dreadful tension of being watched by the paranormal. (Toshio often creeps around in the background, hauntingly watching.) It's definitely a scary movie, whether you're a fan of tension-filled scares or jump-out scares. The acting was fine, the music was great, the editing was excellent, and the story is captivating, although the storytelling does get confusing at times.

Is it any good?

A masterpiece in J-Horror; Takashi's `The Grudge' is a pulse pounding ride on a ghost train. It scores big with it's slow pacing, building tension one scary scene after another, holding on to our fears and not letting go. Great sound effects, spooky atmosphere and plenty of psychological pressure; just ignore the weak American remake.

The film in my opinion was one of the scariest I've seen in a while.  When someone watches a horror movie, they look for scariness and goriness (sometimes, but some people can't stand those blood and guts, I don't mind it at times, but it's not like I'd watch Dead Alive without receiving mental damage), so when I rated it 5/5, I'm rating purely on how scary this film is.  The plot and characters are unimportant because you go through so many that you don't have time to get to know them.  This movie has great suspense, great horror and gave me various chills when I went to bed.  The story is about a family that dies while still holding on to extreme feelings of anger, starting the grudge.  There is practically no background when it comes to what happened to the family (in the original Japanese version).  I can say that the scariest part of the movie is the TV, I'm not going to say what happens as to not spoil it for people just getting ready to watch the movie, but I can say that that part is pretty freaky.  If you're watching this movie to get into character detail, I would suggest watching something else instead, but if it's for the scary, then I would strongly encourage you to watch this (under no obligation).",1330905600,3,1394,4.334615384615384

The the Domino effect takes place and all of a sudden everyone that has never seen an asian horror film now thinks of Ju On as the pinnacle. Well folks... I'm here to tell you that it's not. Ju-on just happens to be the one that got all the attention somehow because someone with some pull watched it and the rest is history.

There's plenty of other Asian horror movies that were more amazing but this one just stood out for whatever reason...and while I'm at it screw The Ring too! So now that the The Grudge and The Ring were such great success every other Asian movie now has decided to copy an element from it. No longer are we getting those great original asian horror flicks no we just get recycled grudge and ring ideas over and over and over again and you know what I'm Sick of it!

Now I'm glad I gave the original a try. ""Ju-On"" is vastly superior to the remake and also much scarier.
Usually the Asian horror movies are the ones that are puzzling to extremes. Here it's the other way around. ""Ju-On"" makes perfect sense, whereas the American remake couldn't possibly make less.
And I better don't start speaking of ""The Grudge 2"". Ugh. You might want to check out ""Ju-On 2"" instead, which easily comes up to the standard of this first installment.",1225584000,3,526,4.791208791208791
1522845,1,B00005JNJR,"True horror is watching an over-hyped Japanese horror film that has as its hideous monster a six-year-old Japanese boy with his face caked in white make-up, mascara and his big moment to scare comes when he bulges his eyes and goes: ""Ssssssssss!"" Wow, I had a heart attack and had to rush to the emergency room for a heart transplant.

One grows bored quick when it seems that every recent japanese horror film always has ghost children and they all have the same make-up person who thinks that by caking their face with white powder and using a pound of black mascara then that's really going to terrify a a horror addict in the year 2008 whose used to CGI monsters or at least fiends done on a brilliant level--like those hooded ghouls in the terrific THE STRANGERS that I saw last week.

1522847,4,B00005JNJR,"American Horror cinema has been in hibernation for too many years (or am I alone in thinking this?!) . . . and while we await a resurgence in original American horror, we give thanks for Asian Horror (note the word ""original"" because I have little interest in seeing remakes of ""Texas Chain Saw,"" ""Black Christmas,"" and ""Halloween"" . . . ohhhh yeah, just in case you didn't know, Rob Zombie is remaking Carpenter's ""Halloween."" Grrreeeaaatt.)

But let's face it . . . Asian Horror accomplishes what American Horror rarely does (even the best of it) . . . it gives its audience ""the creeps."" It exploits every iota of the uncanny . . . leaving its audience a sweating, quivering wreck. Nonetheless, often times, you will find a delayed reaction to these films . . . you'll be driving home from work and instantly feel a cold shiver . . . ""Toshio? Is that you?"" Or worse, they appear in our nightmares . . . ""Toshio? Is that you, again?"" They work on a VERY deep, VERY subconscious level. Understand, there are rarely the ""cheap thrills"" that you find in American Horror, rarely the predictable scares . . . instead, the tension in these works builds to a skin-crawling crescendo. And Ju-On certainly is the quintessential example. (This film will show you why hiding under your covers is a VERY bad idea!!)

The approach to Ju-On is rather surprising. It is a series of interconnected vignettes (think ""Pulp Fiction""). And while this is initially confusing (especially if you experienced the American remake), it is a valuable approach . . . so, be patient. And if you do not understand everything the first time through, that's perfectly normal;) Many people enjoy multiple watches . . . enjoy unraveling its layers of mystery!

Ju-On falls into the sub-genre of ""Haunted House"" . . . but not in the cheesy ""Amityville Horror"" way (which I actually love), but in a ""Ummm, someone should burn down that house NOW"" way. Trust me, you will never, EVER think of your attic in the same again!!

As a final note about this film, take time to listen to the audio commentary reel . . . it is Sam Raimi!! If anyone has ever given America genuinely original horror, it is Sam Raimi (and Romero, but I digress!!)

So, do not sit around waiting for the next great American horror film . . . I do not believe it is not coming anytime soon. Instead, watch Ju-On. And then watch Ringu, and Honogurai Mizu No Soko Kara (the original ""Dark Water""), and Marebito, and Audition . . . you get the picture;)

If you saw the american version it follows the original pretty well with a mix of america's sequal. It's in  japanese and english dub. The only problem with this movie is that I can be hard to follow because you don't have a strict time line.  You find yourself skipping around through characters and ultimately in a time warp. Sometimes you see what is happening now and in the past at the same time and you're not quite sure what is real.

1522897,3,B00005JNJR,"Several years ago, two made-for-tv movies were released in Japan - ""Ju-On: The Curse 1"" and ""Ju-On: The Curse 2"".  Extremely well received, they spawned the theatrical movie ""Ju-On: The Grudge"", constructed so that it could be viewed either as a remake or as a sequel to the two earlier efforts (with the two ""Ju-On Curse"" movies being the only Ju-Ons I've yet to see, I can only speculate as to how the connections go, but that's the story anyway).  The theatrical movie would go on to spawn a Japanese sequel (with a third entry reportedly in the works), plus an American remake and its sequel (which is actually totally unconnected to the Japanese ""Ju-On: The Grudge 2"").

  The basic premise, apparantly based on real legends from Japanese folklore, is this: when a person dies unnaturally, in the grips of powerful emotions like rage, they sometimes fail to pass on to the afterlife but instead become a 'Ju-On', a restless, violent spirit bent on havoc.  Those who die at the hands of one of these Ju-Ons become new Ju-Ons themselves, and the curse spreads in this way.  In this movie, a young Japanese health-care worker who makes rounds to different homes to care for the infirm, has as one of her patients an elderly woman who has recently moved with her family into a new home.  Unfortunately for all, this home is inhabited by Ju-On spirits.

  It's a great premise, with wonderfully bizarre visually imagery and some genuine frights, including the unearthly, absolutely creepy sounds that emanate from the Ju-On ghosts.  Unfortunately, a lot of the movie doesn't make sense.  It's not the Ju-Ons themselves - I love horror movies where a rational explanation for the supernatural phenomena is never uncovered; it often adds to the atmosphere of mystery, eerieness and fright.  It also wasn't the unusual way the story was told, flashing through different time periods; it was a little bit hard to follow (perhaps more so than it should have been given the cryptic, attention-demanding nature of the few other movies that have used a non-linear story like this but remained fully comprehensible; perhaps it would have worked better if I'd gotten to see the two ""Ju-On Curse"" movies first) but it was innovative and allowed the film to follow some really unexpected paths.  The parts that I just couldn't figure out involve the human characters.

  For example, early in the movie the home health care worker is shocked to discover a strange, silent little boy locked up behind some boards in a room upstairs.  She immediately rushes to the phone to report this, but (though the scene itself doesn't last this long) one gets the impression she leaves him alone up there for about twenty minutes while talking to the authorities on the phone, and then fretting about what to do next.  Wouldn't any remotely rational person have tried not to leave the kid alone for any longer than absolutely essential, and try to talk to him and see if he's alright, try and get him to tell them who did this?  There are a couple of other examples of this level of illogical behavior from different characters later in the movie (I don't want to get too specific there; I used the example I did because it happens so early in the movie) so it can't be attributed to one character just being overcome by shock and therefore acting in an unwise way - almost everybody seems to act in implausible ways.  In the case of one example later in the movie, I've heard it suggested that it may be a cultural thing - that people in different parts of the world would react differently.  I don't think I can fully accept that explanation - react differently to certain things, maybe, but everybody consistently reacting in ways to seem to defy all common sense and all credibility (the reactions of the characters in 1981's ""Madman"" look believable compared to some of the behaviors in here)?  Besides, I've never found that problem of repeated implausibility in any other Japanese movies I've seen.  Just using horror as an example, ""Audition"", ""Infection"" and ""Ringu"", to name a few, all made sense.

  Credit where it's due: despite these flaws, the characters somehow stay interesting and even likable.  It's just that these strengths could have been so much more effective without the contrasting flaws.

  Production-wise, ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" looks and sounds beautiful, as is par for the course with most Japanese productions.  The country's filmmakers as a whole seem to take the importance of things like lighting, cinematography, sound, etc., very seriously, and the results are impressive.  The acting is high caliber, although again, I have to wonder how much more impressive it could have been if not for the character implausibilities.

  Overall, the movie is still worth seeing for its own sake, but it's especially reccommended for one reason: it leads right into ""Ju-On 2"", which is a tremendous movie.  And one probably should see this one first, even though it and the American remake are extremely close.  ""Ju-On: The Grudge"" is a good movie in spite of its shortcomings, it's just not anywhere near the cream-of-the-crop in the rich field of Asian horror.",1168300800,,5158,4.85812356979405

1522899,4,B00005JNJR,I saw this movie a few years back and loved it.  It truly had me spooked throughout the whole film.  I played it for a few friends and family one winter night (aged 15 through 70) and everyone was jumping and screaming from start to finish.  It was great fun for everyone and they still bring it up to this day.  I lent my copy out and (unfortunately) never got it back.  Now I am buying it for the second time (I recently purchased a projector and this one will be played outside on the wall of my house).  I seriously recommend this one!,1163376000,3,539,4.134615384615385
1522900,5,B00005JNJR,"I was very skeptical when the American Grudge came out, mainly because I didn't know the history of the movies and thought it was a Ring rip-off. The fact that Sarah Michelle Gellar was in it, Scooby Doo having been her only foray into anything resembling horror(other than her extended cameo in Scream 2), didn't help, so my expectations were low. I was very pleasantly surprised having a PG-13 movie creep me out so bad and when I found the original japanese version, I figured I'd give it a try. Well I can honestly say, it's one of the creepiest movies Ive ever seen. It just goes to show that even without huge budgets or effects, it is very possible to craft a film that sucks you in and then scares you to death. Without schlocky, americanized big scare monments, the movie created a mood and an atmosphere that constantly builds on itself and creates a level of fear that never lets you relax. Shimizu smartly foregoes predictable scare moments for eerie, blink-and-you-miss them tactics that depend on the viewer paying attention and also gives you something to find on repeat viewings. The added bonus of an ending that most american horror movies wouldn't attempt makes the movie stick with you. The performances are credible and involving and the moments that are meant to scare almost always do. It reaffrimed my beleive in movies that can terrify you and to get the full affect, I recomend watching it alone and in a darkened room, if you've got the guts.",1162166400,3,1469,4.675675675675675
1522901,5,B00005JNJR,"Takashi Shimizu's explosive movie, Ju-On, not only is a horror film for those in your life, but a subtle mystery for you to unravel.

The movie plays as a series of seemingly disconnected stories, but which actually connect up in the end. Each story tells of one person who fell prey to the evil in the Saeti house. Eventually, you see the real tragic fate of a love-struck woman, and an innocent child, and not just a vengeful ghost come to haunt those living out of spite.

The cinematography is wonderful, not sporting the typical wind-blowing and red color to symbolize evil. There is subtle changes to the lighting which are seemingly unnoticeable, but leave a great impression on the mind. The sound effects are wonderful, not too cinema-typical, and crawl under your skin with the haunting melodies.

The plot itself is much more complex than a ghost sliding around on her belly. Its a tale of a sad house ripped apart by sadness, and of those who are unfortunate enough to cross the threshold into a place where so much rage and emotions welled up for years. Unlike the American re-make, there were not a whole lot of ghost-in-the-closet scenes that make you recoil in your seat, but there were a lot of scenes that make your skin prickle. You get drawn into the lives of this movie and get twisted up in its convoluted plot.

As soon as you think you've found the main character or that you understand the movie, something comes along to disband you of these notions. The movie is beautifully sad and terrifyingly suspenseful. I recommend this to any horror-movie lover. Its a radical change from the blood and gore of American ""horror films"", and only leaves you wanting more.",1161907200,3,1686,4.6858108108108105
1522902,1,B00005JNJR,"Ju-On the grudge is about a horrific murder that develops an un-rested spirit which rages in a small suburban house in Japan.  The movie constructs itself similar to a puzzled storyline as the movie developed through numerous storylines of the varying characters.  For the most part, viewers can easily be confused in the flick, or bored, as it may seem a bit redundant.  I thought the movie was well written and interesting in theory.  In practice, the movie felt never-ending, and as it drew to a close, i felt betrayed.  The movie was unfulfilled, as it never really explained a lot of questions I held at the end.  One question that leaves me wondering is questioning whether it is a Japanese custom to enter a house when no one answers.  For those interested in Asian horror, try Tale of Two Sisters.

1522903,4,B00005JNJR,"I am inclined to admire JU-ON because it belongs to the class of horror movies that relies principally on atmosphere to create a feeling of dread, as opposed to flinging gore at the screen. The camera shows us the semi-cramped, even slightly seedy world of middle class Japanese life.

On the other hand, I mistakenly thought that this movie would be capable of raising hairs as well as the estimable RINGU. It wasn't. But RINGU set the bar improbably high for Japanese horror movies, and so perhaps it is an unfair comparison to make.

As the director, Takashi Shimizu, shares in one of the extras, he wanted his actors to show extremes of terrors. And so JU-ON features long takes of convulsed and horrified expressions, sometimes with potentially comic results. For example, after confronting the film's spectral terrors, one man brings all his fingertips to his mouth and chews on them in a gesture I've only seen in cartoons and comic strips before.

SIDELIGHT: The actor who plays Toshio (in both this and the American remake of the movie) is actually afraid of cats. And speaking of the American version, it features the same director and has much better production values. I don't know that it's any scarier, but one actor said that Shimizu would creep up behind cast members and scream like a cat to get the desired reaction for a scene.",1151539200,,1346,4.76824034334764

1522926,5,B00005JNJR,"To fully understand what this film entails it does help to know a little cultural background to the piece.

If someone dies a violent tragic death, it leaves a mark.

In the house where this act took place, the opening scenes show a very distraught man and what appears to be his mutilated wife lying the tub.

The story centres around this house and the people that have been there, either living there or visiting.  When they leave this mark is on them, they take it with them.  The boy who lived there previously, Toshio appears in both dead and living ghost form, washed out and drawn to healthy and covered in plasters.  It appears he also likes to join in the torment.

The boy had never been found after the horrific slaying of his mother, whats touching is his pet cat also seems to have suffered the same fate as this is with him too.

Follow the paths of very different people who go about their business until it becomes clear there has been a blight on their lives.

Heart breaking, gripping.  The CCTV footage of the carpark showing the security guard being 'engulfed' by the darkness and its progress up and then through the screen.

Honestly, it was offensive to the eyes, I mean that the visual impact of the shadowy figure was so well done that it was so real it was horrific, in the same way that people who have seen the deleted scenes from the original Exorcist are horrifed when they see the girl crab walk backwards down the stairs.

I have the utmost respect for this movie, I have not watched the remakes - to me, you can't beat the best and thats what this film is.",1142553600,4,1590,4.389078498293515
1522927,4,B00005JNJR,"So, I practice what I preach, if can, I watch the original in which the remake is base.  So, I did.  I think the American version is bloodier and more shocking, but, that is the difference.  Hollywood is more in your face kind of horror, and little mind games, tension, etc (with clear expetions).  Japan on the other hand, is more mental, more psychological horror (although, in the american version comentary, the director said he wanted to make it more graphic, but the censors didn't let him).
So, Ju-on is a great movie, kind of confusing towards the end.  It works if not all is left to the viewer to fill the gaps, which for me is better than giving everything (people imagination can be more macabre than the goriest stuff a director can think up)  They don't explain why or what or whom.  It just is.  You go inside the house and a mean spirit will...well, snuff you.  Everyone is doom, and they don't fool you trying to tell you otherwise. They keep you wondering to the very end, and in every scene they add a new mystery.  So, if you want to start down the path of j-horror, this is a good place to start.  The director and the cinemathographer works a nice depressive atmosphere, in which you can't help to feel hopeless.  The scenes of a empty Tokyo streets are an example.  And like Reimi (or was the other guy?) says in the comentary, the actors reactions are more real and believeable in every situation, but it only works if you watch it with the original japanese track.  Anyway, this is a great scary movie, kind of slow, but more interesting than the Grudge.  The Grudge is bloodier, and a little bit more scary, but I repeat, storywise, Ju-on is a far superior movie.",1138752000,3,1689,4.456026058631922

1522929,5,B00005JNJR,"As long as I'm writing this after the american remake saw the light of day and as long as I watched the japanise original after the remake, I can't stand not comparing these two. I wanted to say now that ""Ju-on"" is definately better than ""The Grudge"" but now I'm thinking that not definately. ""The Grudge"" was the kind of a remake which was neither worse nor better, it was practically just the same. But it lacked genuineness of the atmosphere only japanise pictures possess. I'll say right away to finish with ""The Grudge"" once and for all: in american film I liked its intensity and action nature, besides the scene in a corridor with a shadow I guess was done better technically :) But that's probably all.
""Ju-on"" is not that intense as its remake. If you like more the movies that are a bit faster, you'll have to get used to ""Ju-on's"" slowly-paced, meditative manner of narration. But this manner is one of the main parts of the film's charm and of the charm of J-horror in general.
""Ju-on"" is divided into segments telling about different characters, and these segments are not chronological (recall ""Pulp Fiction""). This also takes some time to get used to. But this style of directing pulles you in, it envolves you into the story, you start getting into sort of a trance, and this way you get frightened easier and stronger. And ""Ju-on"" has something to offer - it has truly chilling and hair-raising scenes. It's that kind of a movie you won't be able to cross your apartment at night after watching. You won't be able to be left in a dark room staying calm. And that is worth a lot regarding a horror film.
If you've watched the remake, don't hesitate to watch the original too - all the same it's better. If you haven't, I envy you because you have such a bloodcurdling trip ahead...",1133136000,4,1797,4.532307692307692
1522930,5,B00005JNJR,"I can remember four films in my life that really scared me:

- As a child in the early 60's, I was pactically destroyed after seeing THE CURSE OF THE FACELESS MAN on ""Chiller Theater.""

-When I was about 12 or 13, I was freaked out over THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.

-At age 21, I was pretty much knocked for a loop by THE EXORCIST.

As a ""middle-aged"" adult, I  enjoy horror films as much as ever, but more for enjoyment than for scares. That's why JU-ON took me by surprise. The last thing I expected to find was a film thaat would actually give me the creeps! The film generates a really disturbing and eerie sense of horror, heightened by the fact that  the most frightening scenes are set during the middle of the day, and contain no gore or special effects.

The chills in JU-ON arrive almost in the form of snapshots, sudden scenes of terror intruding upon what appears to be the most normal and tranquil of settings. What elevates the horror is that there is no rhyme or reason behind the malevolence. The various characters are hounded simply because they have some sort of innocent connection to a house which plays a significant part in the story. They are terrorized inside the house, and outside, and there's just no way to fight it.

The scares in JU-ON are of the primal variety: slow-moving horrors descending upon you ..... unnerving sounds and things always shimmering out of the corner of your eye .... madness encroaching at every turn. Characters find themselves trapped in a waking nightmare.

Some reviewers have complained about the non-sequential aspect of the story. But this is a big plus. It's another element that keeps you wary and watchful, and also makes you hungry for a second viewing. In fact, subsequent viewings really fill in the blanks and make for a rewarding cinematic experience.

Actress Takako Fuji, who plays the ghost/demon, is a revelation. She conjures up a truly palpable sense of obsessed, otherworldly malice using no words, just facial expressions and body language/movements. She is a haunting presence that will stay with you LONG after you view the film.

I'm at a loss to understand certain criticisms of JU-ON. In an age of cookie-cutter horror flicks, with interchangeable scripts and the usual gore, JU-ON creates a frightening atmosphere employing imagery that, on the one hand, harks back to the great ghost/demon stories of the past, and on the other, is strikingly original.

The direction and acting are just right, never overstated or flashy. The film moves at an even pace, not ""slowly,"" but engrossing. It is just so ""well done"" on all levels -- not too much, not too little. It's a true achievement in the field. Far from being a derogatory description, I would say that it does remind me of an ""art-house"" film, in the sense that you don't sit there marvelling at the effects or the budget. The film is understated on one level, and visually arresting on the other.

If you look at  some of the ""horror"" films made in Japan, Korea and Thailand over the past decade, you have to admire how these directors have ushered ""horror"" cinema away from the usual ""shock"" formulas and back to a style that relies on mood, atmosphere and a sense of the eerie intruding upon the everyday.

The Americanized remake of JU-ON (starring Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a well-done film in its own right, although the story is simplified for American consumption. It provides more back-story on the ghost-demon, dumps the non-linear storyline and omits some of the original's most disturbing moments. The original JU-ON, however, is a modern classic, a prime example of what horror cinema could and should be.",1131235200,5,3656,4.762658227848101
1522931,3,B00005JNJR,"While there were scary moments and some great J-horror imagery in Ju-on, the lack of a main character really hurt the movie. I felt like I was watching a series of short films with the same ending. It would have been much more frightening and suspenseful with a few long-term main characters.

Something interesting I found out after the movie was that one of the spooky apparitions is most likely related to a Japanese spirit called a rokurokubi -- an evil female spirit with an extendable neck. The image was a bit confusing (I wasn't sure exactly why it was supposed to be scary), and finding out that it had a place in Japanese mythology really helped.

Mostly because of the film's choppy construction, I would skip Ju-on and see Ringu or Face instead.",1128470400,,757,4.641791044776119

Shimizu is brilliant.  I only wish that I could see the original two movies that were made for TV in Japan.  Even with the interest in this film, there seems to be no plans in the works to bring them to DVD in the States.

i personally hope this trend of Japanese horror cinema continues in the US.  We seem to have lost our way with making good horror films when at one time, we were so far beyond anyone else in quality.  Now the role is reversed: the telling of Japanese legends set in modern times is incredibly eerie.

You will think twice after  watching before entering a home, look at cats in a different way, and hope that you never encounter a place with a Ju-on attached to it.",1126224000,2,528,4.387755102040816

Don't be put off by the subtitles and for God's sake don't turn on the English dubbing. Maybe it was just my copy but the English dubbing had these regional British English accents (they sounded like characters from a Yorkshire sit-com called 'last of the summer wine') this may mean nothing to a non-British reader but just take my word for it, they are wooden and do nothing for the film. I quickly switched off and returned to the Japanese dialogue and English subtitles and found the film a lot more enjoyabe.

Like all of the original Japanese versions of films out right now Ring etc this one has a lot more of a story, while this may not be a bad thing it does tend to drag on a little and as stories cross over in time it can be a little disjointed at times.

Still a good film worth a watch, my main disappointments were the 'ghost woman' in this version is not as scary as in the American one and the stairs scene at the end dragged on a little too long. Still the story of the policeman and what happened to his family was cool (this isn't in the American version)",1123804800,,1238,4.259574468085106

It's framework or at times lack therof didn't bother me in the slightest, in fact this film plays like a nightmare being played on the screen, like David Lynch's Lost Highway. Some films, like this one tap into something stronger than narrative and grab ahold of you within your psyche. I really enjoyed this movie. This one, as well as Ringu and Dark Water(the original) actually leave me feeling breathless afterwards. Their vision is untarnished, and the passion that fuels them, in particular Ju-on, jumps off the screen.

1522975,4,B00005JNJR,"When a person dies a violent death amidst powerful rage, a curse is born.  This curse has the potential of attaching itself to anybody that comes within its orbit and renews itself with each victim.  Taken to its logical extreme, it seems that such a curse could propagate itself endlessly until none are left untouched.  Director Takashi Shimizu suggests that perhaps that is exactly what is happening with his many shots of deserted streets and the general atmosphere of desolation.  This is not a linear horror film where a hero or heroine stumbles upon something horrible and struggles to put it right, most likely succeeding in the end (or perhaps failing just enough to leave the door open for a sequel).  ""Ju-On"" consists of a number of vignettes, scattered in time, that quite simply shows the curse and its major ghost claiming one victim after another.  The victims generally don't know what is happening to them, and the film puts a lot of responsibility on the viewer to piece it together for him/herself.  Some will find this a hopeless, confusing muddle.  However, if you are like me, you will appreciate the creepy atmosphere and enjoy contemplating the nature of the murderous ghost./",1122163200,,1200,4.905940594059406
1522976,4,B00005JNJR,"First off i would like to say that Ju-on is now being released with audio commentary from Sam Raimi and some
other US Horror director. They go on complementing the film aprraising Takashi Shimizu and Giving High Honors
to the way Takashi Shimizu filmed this or how original it is. They also speak of Horror the horror genre how
this JU-ON has affected it and also they breakdown scenes with commentary. Perhaps more importantly the Producer
(Sam Raimi) of The American Version of The Grudge a remake of Ju-On speaks now and again about how The Grudge:
that is the ""american remake"" in post.

That is to say already that he had already produced the film and Takashi Shimizu had already directed it. He
spoke in past tense as if the movie was already finished only to be released in october of 2004. This movie you
have to see it if you like the american version it is creepy as hell. There is definite difference in the way the
story was told. Different characters are more fleshed out in the american version but i believe the american version
is a little confusing. To spite the fact that the budget for this film was much much less (i think Takashi Shimizu said
2-4 million?) in budgetit does not fail in reaching you in fact the vision seems to be put to use more thoroughly.

There are scenes in this movie that should have been exactly as they had it here. In Ju-On there are many parts that
are not in the ""American Version"" it was nice to see some things i did not know. There is even a back story missing
schoolgirls that go into the house and end up looking for themselves, as far as i could, that was my understanding.
Anyway plenty of fine Japanese actresses. Hitomi is the cutest. The Perfect Grudge, THe perfect JU-on is this one,
not the american version, if he had the budget for this film that he had for the american version this would have
been the perfect version. ""THE 1"". Not that this person was huge on special effects, instead relying more on
creepy timing and imagery as opposed to in your face big knife big monster. This man is very smart, it is not huge on
special effects it doesnt need to be this movie just does not fail to deliver to you the vision. What he could do is
very interesting He could go back and make another ALternate version adding some cgi or tweaking the parts when the
lady with ""the grudge"" appears. The sublte creeping building horror is the type that leaves everything to the
imagination but then leaves nothing because it is in your face. In the amercian version the ladywith the ""GRUDGE""
shows up like 3 times it SUCKED, here she is really more prominent. So nice to see, it was more more clear cut and concise

1522978,3,B00005JNJR,"Ju-On: The Grudge (Takashi Shimizu, 2003)

By now, there are so many versions of Ju-On running around that people on IMDB are running around posting in the wrong movie's forum and convinced they're in the right place. Here, I'm talking about the Ju-On flick subtitled The Grudge, theatrically released in Japan in 2003 (not the original V-cinema movie).

The American film The Grudge is supposedly a remake of this movie, and one can see similarities in a few places (the first thing I thought upon seeing Mrs. Sachie was ""man, Grace Zabriskie was the PERFECT actress for the remake!""), but there's less filled in here than there was in the American version of the film. (One wonders if the pieces in the American film that aren't here are from the first two Ju-On films, which were video-only releases.) I was able to follow what was going on, but only because I'd seen the American version of the film first; I'm pretty sure I'd have been hopelessly lost otherwise. There's a great deal to be said for impressionism, and it's likely that I'd have been able to figure it out with three or four more viewings. I certainly might give it another shot a couple of years down the road; some of my favorite films are movies that have required multiple viewings to really understand-- but my first impression of this one was ""eh."" ***",1117152000,,1328,4.670940170940171
1522979,5,B00005JNJR,"This movie was fantastic!  My only regret was that I watched the butchered American title first.  Ju-on took a bunch of short stories and melted them all together perfectly.  Yes that did make it a little confusing at parts but that added to the whole mistique of the movie.  It had you racing tring to put the pieces in order while tring to keep up with the next story.  And to top it all off the ending was incredible.  Unlike many American horror films the ending ruins the whole movie but the Japanese have perfected the art.  The ending totally matches the feel and message of the movie.  My advice to you is watch this movie, you'll never go back to American horror ever again!!",1116201600,5,684,4.416

The same little boy in The Grudge has a bigger part here, and it's weirder. The acting is solid, and it is a little bloodier. The DVD has hidden things on the menu.",1115337600,3,336,4.184615384615385
1523041,5,B00005JNJR,"I very much liked the American remake of ""The Grudge"" (starring Sarah Michelle Gellar), but it is vastly exceeded by the Japanese original, directed by the same man, Takashi Shimizu.  ""Spider-Man"" and ""Evil Dead"" director Sam Raimi does the DVD commentary and he ranks ""Ju-On"" as one of the top 20 horror films of all time, up there with ""The Exorcist"" and ""Night of the Living Dead.""  In this case the simpler Japanese version is more surprising than the elaborate American (and I speak as one who thought ""The Ring"" was a much better movie than ""Ringu."")

The DVD includes several deleted scenes including the even more ghastly ""alternate ending"" (nobody dared to inflict this on Sarah Gellar, I guess.)  There's also an easter egg on the Delted Scenes page: click on the small round white object under the menu and get another spooky surprise.  ""Ju-On"" is less grisly than the average American horror movie (although it has many memorably frightening, graphic images.)  The restraint works better than the numbing repition of gore that many filmakers mistake for horror.  A movie has to engage your mind and heart to be truly terrifying, not just your gag reflex.

""Ju-On"" is relentless towards the characters, and this is made even worse because Shimizu has stocked his film with some heart-rendingly pretty young Japanese actresses.  It becomes even more terrifying and upsetting to see these sweeties get it from the ghosts or demons or whatever they are.  (There's interviews and backstage footage as a bonus on the DVD if you want to see more of them.)  The same very black, cyclical view of history in ""The Grudge"" is also present in ""Ju-On"".  The past is a trap: once you're caught you don't escape.  The intricate storytelling, in which past, present, living and dead are intermingled is designed to keep you on your toes and anxious about what is revealed next. The movie becomes like a very scary jigsaw puzzle; you are dreading the whole picture as it begins to take horrific shape.  The great American noir writer Cornell Woolrich, that dark poet of the inevitability of fate, could have easily written ""Ju-On.""  Just be sure to watch it with a group of friends in the daylight, and not alone at midnight like I did.  You'll be trying to shake off the shivers for days afterwards.",1113523200,6,2295,4.816326530612245
1523042,4,B00005JNJR,"If you've seen the Grudge already, don't think for an instant you've seen Ju-On, by the end of the movie, they are completely different, not only with what characters are used (there is, for example, a high school student involved, as well as the inspector who originally studied the case, to name a few). Ju-On, unlike the Grudge, is made on a budget, and the lack of fancy special effects is very evident, but the movie doesn't suffer much for it.

To be a bit more specific with it, Kayako (aka the Woman Ghost) is portrayed much more sympathetically in Ju-On than she is in the Grudge, and in the American remake she is far scarier (it sounds silly written down, but the Japanese Kayako has hair you could see from outer space), although I must admit that in the last climactic scene, the image of the Japanese Kayako was plastered in my mind far more than the American one.

As horror, it worked pretty well, although, well, in the director's commentary for the deleted scenes he says he removed certain scenes because they were ""laughable"", that is they were too cheesy, or going too far to be taken seriously, and quite a few scenes still had that going (the very last scene, for example features a woman, not Rika (the main character) as far as I can tell and not Kayako (the ghost) lying dead in a garbage bag. Who is this woman? I still can't figure it out. But, it zooms in on her very slowly, making the parting bit predictable to the point of laughability (to use the director's words).

Overall, if you like J-Horror, *really* liked the Grudge, or are a fan of low budget horror movies, I'd strongly recommend this. Otherwise, you may find it confusing, boring, or just plain old hard to watch. As with Anime, I'd strongly recommend having some concept of the Japanese language and a bit of knowledge of the culture, otherwise parts of it will make no sense at all.

In some parts of the film I was scratching my head and other times I was nodding my head in satisfaction of a good scary part they threw in there a few times. As I have said in my title I had mixed feelings throughout the entire film. This film gives off a good scare in some parts and then leaves you confused in other parts. I give this a solid three because that's how I feel about this film- not great, but not terrible either. I ask myself if this confusion was because of the fact I was constantly comparing it to the American version which isn't a good idea- for Ju- On is pretty different from the American version and that's probably a good reason why many of us experienced confusion because we were comparing the two. But the film was a good scare like the American version was so I give both a solid three.",1112486400,,921,4.150837988826815
1523044,4,B00005JNJR,"I normally write tediously long reviews, but I'll probably keep this one pretty short, as I don't have all that much to say.  This is not a brilliant film, but a solid, entertaining and fairly creepy horror film, if not a really genuinely scary one.  If you've seen the American remake, 'The Grudge', you'll know exactly what you're getting in to.  Most of the major scare scenes in this film were just redone for the American version, albeit with higher production values and some different actors. (Though some of them are the same as well)  Overall, I'd say the quality of the two films is about the same.  Naturally, the American version has higher production values, and some interesting ideas, but it's a bit less coherent, and is modified a bit so that it is expressly derivative of the American version of 'The Ring' at times.  Still, if ya like one ya might as well see the other, though I'd recommend you see 'Ju-On' first, since that's the natural order of things.

'Ju-On' has virtually no plot, which is fine by me.  In short, people become in some way involved with a cursed house, and are then assailed by ghosts.  The film is divided into six episodes, not shown in chronological order, each of which centers around a specific person who is cursed by the house.  The jumping back and forth and the random appearance and disappearance of characters may be a bit confusing, but just keep in mind that there really isn't much of anything to understand and you'll do fine.  The plot is just an excuse to string together a bunch of horror scenes, which it does nicely.  The acting is sufficient, if not extraordinary, and the subtitles are fairly well done, lacking the awkwardness you sometimes find. (Though the dialogue is all totally perfunctory)  The direction is not terribly flashy, but it's certainly very controlled and competent, and Shimizu does a good job of maintaining a sort of constant tension without becoming either excessively drawnout or overwrought.

The ghosts have no real apparent MO.  They just seem to appear and disappear at will, using different forms, occasionally.  Lotsa of people don't like there not being very many specific 'rules' regarding ghost behavior, but I think it works best this way.  Letting them do whatever the hell they want allows for more unpredictability and creativity. All of the episodes are fairly effective, but the 5th one, involving a schoolgirl, daughter of one of the other victims I believe, is the best.  Actually, the very best scene would have to be the very opening, prior to the main episodes, showing a brief montage of what occurred to bring about the curse.  With the rapid edits and extreme closeups, I can't even tell what's really going on in this scene, but it's really quite jarring and haunting.

There are quite a few different ghosts, though 2 ones a particularly prevalent, those being Toshio and his mother, whose name I can't recall.  Toshio, the catboy featured prominently in the ads for the remake, works pretty well.  His occasional meowing is a little... weird, but he's a fairly creepy little kid.  Still, some of his scampering about is more cute than ominous.  His mother, the head ghost, so to speak, is pretty scary.  Her face is very haunted and sad, and her broken-back crawling, while not something we haven't seen before, is pretty creepy.  Finally the 3 schoolgirl ghosts who appear briefly are quite effective, though that's probably largely because the buildup was so nicely done.(They're part of the aforementioned fifth episode.)

Many people out there bemoaning the whole PG-13 horror trend will probably be happy to see that this is rated R.  Well, calm down, because that rating is a travesty, and this film is more tame than the PG-13 remake.  This film has no profanity, or nudity or gore or even any actual on-screen violence. (How the  ghosts kill people is uncertain.  They just kind of make them be dead, or if they do something else, we don't get to see it)  Well, some of the ghosts' clothes are a little bloody, but that's it in terms of theoretically offensive content.  I don't mind, as I don't think that every horror movie needs to be a gorefest, but plenty of people apparently do, so keep this in mind. (Of course, these peole are stupid as it is real tough to do a genuine gorefest with just an R rating even these days, and 9 out of 10 horror films don't even try, but whatever)

All that said, it's tough to say who I recommend this to, as most people have already made up there minds.  Serious Japanese horror fans have already seen it, those who disdain PG-13 horror films probably won't be able to get into it, and those who are into the American versions of these films may or may not be able to get except the lowered production values.  But hey, I like it.  About all I can say.

1523045,2,B00005JNJR,"This is a non-spoiler review of ""Ju-On.""

The opening scenes of ""Ju-On"" promise us eerie, old-school scares, the likes of which are far too rare in modern American horror films. Yet director Takashi Shimizu chooses to contort ""Ju-On""'s basic ghostly revenge story into a fragmented series of flashbacks. Unless you go to horror films to be confused, rather than scared, this is a major miscalculation. The shame of it is that Shimizu does have a series of effective (if unoriginal) scares stashed throughout his film. Shimizu is also smart enough to weigh atmosphere more heavily than gore. It's too bad there are no characters to care about. And no, this is not due to cultural differences - I'm very familiar with Japanese cinema and culture and this is not a good example of Japanese cinema.

Had I stumbled upon ""Ju-On"" late at night on television, my rating would have been higher. But this is far from groundbreaking, far from terrifying, and far from a modern classic. This is a cult B-movie, nothing more.",1111708800,3,1013,4.8497109826589595

I still have yet to figure out why this story warranted being told in the first place.  From what I've read the idea here is to teach children the evils of abandoning their elders.  This is seen in scenes such as one where a girl ignores an elderly man so that she can talk on her cell phone.  However, how anybody found anything in this plot other than a mound of goo is beyond me.  This film plays as series of episodes in which a serial killer knocks off people he doesn't like. Only in this case the serial killer is a shadow or a puff of smoke or something else not scary.  The fact that no time is spent on the killer hurts this movie immensely.  Their human characters are already flat, and not having a well hyped monster to cheer for kills this movie.  It is worth noting that both this and Ringu show some sort of distrust of technology, and I find that quite interesting considering their empire was built on technology. **1/2",1110585600,,1083,4.188405797101449

The spooky settings were awesome.  I have never been so scared in all my life with a movie.  I could not wait to watch this.  I had chills

I don't usually tell a storyline, just how good the story is, but this one is one of the best horrors I have ever seen.

1523122,3,B00005JNJR,"A ""ju-on"" is a sort of self-perpetuating curse that is created when someone dies in a rage. The embodiment of the curse turns its rage on others, who die horribly themselves, perpetuating the curse and leaving a trail of death and terror. In this story, a young volunteer social worker named Rika (Megumi Okina) visits a home in the course of her work, but finds only an old woman and an unnerving young boy there. Later, when her colleague (Yoji Tanaka) arrives to check on the family, he finds the old woman dead and Rika in a state of shock. The police are summoned, only to discover the old woman's son and daughter-in-law (Kanji Tsida and Shuri Matsuda) dead in the attic. The investigating officers try to understand what happened in the house in the past, that seems to be continuing, as people who enter the house meet a terrible end or disappear mysteriously.

""Ju-On"" is a low-budget Japanese horror film written and directed by Takashi Shimizu, who previously made two films for Japanese video based on the same ""ju-on"" concept. The film is presented in 6 segments, each telling the story of one character, allowing the audience to piece together what has happened in the house and follow the continuing curse. The low budget is evident in the lighting and acting, but ""Ju-On"" has more serious shortcomings. I didn't find it scary. I was startled a few times in the first half hour of the film, but ""Ju-On"" exemplifies the problem with showing the source of the horror in films. Once we see something, we are no longer afraid of it. The ghostly corpses quickly become fixtures that have no emotional impact.

I found the story reasonably interesting until the last two segments. At one point, the narrative takes a big leap forward in time. This segment is palpably contrived, removed from the present, and involves characters who are essentially extraneous. It causes temporal confusion and could easily have been replaced with more immediate and more effective material. I think the entire segment was ill-advised. The final segment is perhaps the most important, as it concludes the film and brings the story full circle. But it has the worst writing. The set-up is beyond nonsensical, and the conclusion, although fine in concept, is realized in such a way as to undermine itself. I had to watch it twice to understand it. And once I did, it was obvious that the conclusion would have been much more affecting and less confusing had the visuals simply been chosen more wisely.

Horror films aren't supposed to make sense, but they need to make sense within their own context. This script is sloppy. A little more thought would have gone a long way in elevating the film. ""Ju-On"" has some thrills. It's a good concept. But it should have been scarier and more coherent.

The DVD: Bonus features include some behind the scenes footage, cast and crew interviews, deleted scenes, an audio commentary, and a theatrical trailer. The bonus features are subtitled. ""Behind the Scenes"" is about 28 minutes of on-set footage, divided into 3 segments. It shows some scenes being shot without any commentary. ""Cast and Crew Interviews"" include interviews with director Takashi Shimizu (5 1/2 minutes) and actors Megumi Okina (1 1/2 minutes), Misaki Ito (1 min.), Misa Uehara (1 min.), and Yui Ichikawa (1 min.). There are 6 ""Deleted Scenes"", with director's commentary, including an extended ending. The audio commentary is by Sam Raimi (of Spiderman fame), who produced the American remake of ""Ju-On"" (The Grudge) and his long-time friend, actor and writer Scott Spiegel. It is a conversational commentary about how the film achieves horror, the horror genre in general, and their own films, by two men who enjoy ""Ju-On"" very much.

1523124,5,B00005JNJR,"I just recently purchased the four JuOn movies off ebay (Ju On The Curse, Ju On The Curse 2, Ju On The Grudge, and Ju On The Grudge 2). I must say that this film, JuOn (subtitled 'The Grudge' on my copy of the DVD, but not to be confused with the American remake) is one of the most horrific films I have ever seen in my lifetime.

Firstly, I know many people are prepared to claim that this movie jumps around too much, and requires too much thinking, and in all honesty, this is true. If you're not prepared to watch this movie with an open mind, then you're better off watching a movie in the 'Friday The 13th' Series. There are many spots where you are left filling in the gaps yourself, but honestly, that's where half of the horror comes from, your mind thinking about the story and imagery long after you've finished watching.

The special effects are also nicely done, although at some times tbe characters can look a little cheaply done (but no-where near the level of cheap-ness as shown in the original Made-For-TV JuOn ""The Curse"", only available in Japan). This movie will leave you with images that will stay with you for nights on end, and, as a previous reviewer mentioned, left me needing to sleep with the TV on for a few days.

Hollywood manages to remake a film
that turns out better than
the original foreign film.

Simply put:
""Ju-On"" is not very good.

But I must be fair,
I probably did myself a disservice by
seeing ""The Grudge"" before I saw this movie.
I'm such a big fan of Japanese horror/suspense
that it pains me to say that ""Ju-On""
is simply not worth the time to watch,
let alone buying it.
In Japanese horror films,
you're used to being scared
out your wits
not just by creepy characters and
unhumanly frightening situations,
but also terror that haunts you
on a psychological level.
None of this happens in ""Ju-On""

The most surprising thing is that
the director of this film also
directed ""The Grudge.""
My question is:
""What the hell happened?""
After seeing ""Ju-On"" I've
come to the conclusion that Shimizu
must have directed this film through
bouts of sleepwalking; or perhaps
telepathically through a coma. Basically,
""Ju-on"" is like ""The Grudge"" with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

The plot is the same,

1523127,5,B00005JNJR,"Ju-On:  the curse of one who dies in the grip of a powerful rage.  It gathers and takes effect in the places where that person was alive.  Those who encounter it die and a new curse is born.  -opening quote from Ju-On.

The phrase ""emotional bloodstain"" comes to mind, as the curse arising from a murder that took place five years before still besmirches a house where the Tokunaga family, consisting of husband Katsuya, his wife Kazumi, and the former's mother live.  All people connected with the house will either die or disappear.  The story is broken into six segments titled after the people affected by the curse.

In the first, ""Rika,"" Rika Nishina, a student at the social welfare center, is forced by her supervisor Hirohashi to look in on the Tokunaga's, as the normal person assigned to them hasn't reported.  She goes there to find the house in an absolute state, and Katsuya's elderly mother, Sachie-san, in a state of shock.  However, she hears weird noises upstairs and discovers a black cat and a six-year boy named Toshio locked in an upstairs closet.  But that's nothing compared to what she sees later.

Cut to what happened the day before.  In ""Katsuya,"" the husband becomes possessed by something and his behaviour changes. His facial expression is simply scary, as it's far from the usual absent-minded but nice salaryman.

""Hitomi,"" Katsuya's younger sister, is an office girl who has a frightening experience in the woman's bathroom at work and later her apartment.  Distorted faces on the TV, Hitomi hiding in her own bed, and the low guttural croaking sound emitted by the curse-think of a Geiger Counter with strep throat, count as one of the scariest moments.

""Toyama,"" is the detective who investigated the original murders of the house, and is reluctantly pressed back into service by Nakagawa, the current detective in charge, while ""Izumi,"" his young daughter, has her own experience in the house as a high school student.  She and three friends had gone in that house as a dare, but Izumi, scared, left before her friends were gotten at.  Izumi becomes a nervous wreck who stays in her room, blinds down and windows taped up because ""they are watching.""  Finally, in ""Kayoko,"" the name of the first victim, we go back to Rika and her ultimate fate.

Points of note:  The story must take place during a ten year period, the beginning being the first murders, the end being the death of Izumi, as at least five years pass from ""Toyama"" to ""Izumi"".  It's also in her episode that we learn the discovery of one of Rika's body, so we assume Rika was allowed to live five years longer, as was Toyama.  There is a small continuity error.  From the daylight streaming through the house, it's clear that it's mid-afternoon when Hitomi's message is heard by Rika.  Yet when we see Hitomi making the call herself, people are getting ready to leave work, so it must be nighttime.  Also, the curse is supposed to be all-pervading and powerful, so why does it need to ask Hitomi for her apartment number before it gets her?

The performers are good to watch, especially Megumi Okina (Rika), Misaki Ito (Hitomi), and Misa Uehara (Izumi), who along with Yui Ichikawa (Chiharu, Izumi's classmate) makes her film debut.

What makes Ju-On scary and vicious is that unlike Ringu, there is no spell to remove the curse, plus those innocents who get dragged into it, like poor Rika or Hitomi, are automatically doomed. The presence of the curse, embodied as a crawling long-haired woman in white dress-sound familiar?-is simply creepy, but so is the presence of Toshio, who might be a cute little kid if not for his ghost-pale complexion and large eyes.  Shots of him darting away score for suspenseful moments.  Most of the time, the curse is an indistinct black shadow, but even then it's pretty darn scary.  People screaming as they are dragged away to their doom, and seeing the bedcovers bulge from beneath until the victim looks in to discover the creepy curse woman also provide some scary moments.

Scarier than Ringu or its descendants, Ju-On is probably the scariest movie I've ever seen.  If this is a scary movie, I don't know what Scream or Friday the 13th is.",1107648000,6,4186,4.761442441054092

Again I've been met with severe disappointment! I'm disappointed because, once again, one of the most influential and talked about films from Asia has not only found its way to our American shores but has also spawned a halfway decent ""Hollywood Remake"" -- resulting in the fact that I can no longer gloat about being part of an exclusive elite, so to speak, with regard to having had the fortune to experience this and other once 'inaccessible' films.

But now that another attention-getting spook-story from Japan has been introduced to a wider audience in the West, it is perhaps a good time to share some of the ""deeper"" elements of the story, its history, etc., especially since a lot of misinformation has been circulating about everything connected to & associated with this film in other forums, and is already beginning to take firm root in Amazon's review forums as well. So I'm taking it upon myself to clear up some of those misconceptions DESPITE the fact that very few people in this and other review forums really don't seem to care or appreciate that someone is trying to set them on the right path. (This has, unfortunately, always been my curse in life.)

First, the film's title should be explained. The name, ""JUON,"" is also seen alternately rendered as ""JU-ON."" Whether there is a 'hyphen' inserted in the romanized title is really a minor issue as far as anyone is concerned; I personally prefer not using it. Many of you will probably consider the following information that I will now supply about the movie's original title to be a case of ""nit-picking,"" but please hear me out.

The Sino-Chinese characters (or ""kanji"") that are used together to make up the film's title is, in reality, a ""non- word"" in the Japanese language: It is the result of two deliberately selected kanji placed together by writer/director Shimizu Takashi (hence, the 'explanation' given as to its 'pronunciation & meaning' in the film's introductory text prior to the opening credits). Taken together, the new word's translation into English means, roughly, ""A Curse of Resentment""; Separately, the kanji literally read as ""Curse-Grudge."" So, in actuality, EITHER word-- ""Curse"" or ""Grudge"" --could indeed be (and actually has been) used as a way to translate the film's title into English. But whereas the use of either title in English is 'essentially' correct, neither one used by itself is 'technically' correct -- and a deeper, more forceful sense of meaning is lost without this additional understanding.

As new initiates into this film are virtually all aware of by now, this film's ""unofficial"" English title, ""The Grudge,"" is associated with both this film and with its Hollywood remake. What is not commonly known, however, is that this English title was also given to this movie's original Japanese theatrical sequel, ""JUON 2"" (hence: ""The Grudge 2""). But here's where it starts to get kinda fun (and confusing) -- Remember how I said that the English title, ""The Curse,"" had also been used? This is correct, but it is not in connection with this film and/or its sequel (which were both major 'theatrical' releases in Japan & throughout East Asia), it is more often associated with their two predecessor movies: ""JUON"" and ""JUON 2."" Yes -- Same titles -- But Different formats.

The ""original"" original ""JUON"" (a.k.a. ""The Curse"") began as a 2-part ""V-Cinema"" (i.e. ""made-for-television""/""video"") production.

And before you start getting too confused, let me help alleviate any additional confusion which is likely to develop due to much of the misinformation being propagated by those ""not-in-the-know.""

By now you are hearing or reading a number of remarks stating that the THEATRICAL version of ""Juon"" (""The Grudge"") is a ""REMAKE"" of the V-CINEMA ""Juon"" (""The Curse"") --



When you encounter anything or anyone repeating that statement as fact, be very much assured that such information is blatantly FALSE! ""Juon,"" the 'theatrical' version, is NOT -- (repeat) -- ""NOT"" a 'remake' of the 'V-Cinema' releases! The ""theatrical"" release of ""Juon"" (this film) and its theatrical sequel, ""Juon 2,"" are both ""CONTINUATIONS"" of the same story established in ""Juon"" and ""Juon 2"" the video productions. To call the 'theatrical' release of ""Juon"" a remake of the 'V-Cinema' productions would be like calling ""STAR TREK II: The Wrath of Khan"" a 'remake' of the ""Space Seed"" episode of the original Star Trek television series. So, in effect, ""Juon"" (this film) and ""Juon 2"" (its theatrical sequel) are to be considered as ""Juon, part 3"" and ""Juon, part 4"" respectively.

This takes us to the REAL 'remake' of this film, the Raimi/Shimizu collaboration, ""THE GRUDGE."" I'll be forthright and honest in admitting that I was not entirely impressed with the Americanized version: Not because I'm prejudiced in favor of the Japanese original, but because the whole 'feel' of the movie just wasn't right -- It reeked of ""Hollywood"" (too loud, too bright, too fast, too crisp -- not enough of the 'gloominess' and 'ambiance' that make this film-- ""Juon"" --work so well).

On the plus side, Sam Raimi (""The Evil Dead""), who financed the Occidental remake, had sense enough to employ the same director of the original films. And though it was not really necessary, Mr. Raimi chose to keep the story set in its native Japan and limited the use of Caucasian actors -- yet the remake could have just as easily (and I think more convincingly) been set in NYC, LA, or here in Honolulu, where heavy Asian populations already reside and have the added benefit of speaking English as their native language (assuming that it was their intent was to continue to cater to Japanese or other Asian cultural themes).

Mr. Raimi & Shimizu-san are also to be commended in that, most unlike Gore Verbinski's infuriating so-called 'remake' of Nakata Hideo's ""RING"" and Walter Salles' apparently equal affront to Nakata-san's genius (as can be easily attested to just from viewing the preview trailer alone) with his horrendous reworking of ""HONOGURAI MIZU NO SOKO KARA"" (currently in production as ""DARK WATER""), the Raimi/Shimizu remake of ""Juon"" is the closest thing to a TRUE & GENUINE ""REMAKE"" of any film I have probably ever seen! ""The Grudge,"" for the most part, remains VERY faithful to the source material -- even reusing many of the same sets, the same locales and even, yes, the same actors! Unfortunately, because of using a new cast of Caucasian actors while having key members of the Japanese cast reprising their original roles, the story as it plays out in the remake loses some of its effectiveness and rationale, due to the inability to duplicate certain situations which account for certain behaviors among several of the characters in the original.

One final comparison between this version of ""Juon"" and ""The Grudge"" (just to confuse you a little more before I sign off). The common proclaimation being tossed about is that the ""The Grudge"" is a remake of this film, ""Juon"" (i.e. this 'theatrical' release). That statement is only HALF correct. In actuality, ""The Grudge"" is a remake of ""Juon"" AND ""Juon."" Have I totally confused you yet? Don't be confused -- here's what I mean: The American remake incorporates scenes and elements from both ""Juon, Part 3"" (this film, the first 'theatrical' release, a.k.a. ""The Grudge"") AND from ""Juon, Part 1"" (the first 'V-Cinema' release a.k.a. ""The Curse""). So if you should watch both this movie and the American remake, this additional information will help to explain why there's such a difference between the two versions. ""The Grudge"" (the remake) is basically giving more of the ""backstory"" which is not to be had in this edition of ""Juon"" -- so all of the ""additional"" and ""different"" scenes in ""The Grudge"" (remake) are not so much ""artistic license"" as they are giving you more of the story you would not have been familiar with unless you had been privileged enough to have seen the original V-Cinema release(s).

Although the remake incorporates elements from the first video production of this series, this first theatrical version can still be thoroughly enjoyed and understood even without the 'back story,' because enough is revealed throughout this movie to allow you to follow the sequence of events, to piece together the history of the curse, to figure out who the characters are and what's motivating them, etc. I take great confidence in declaring this because it was this same film (""Juon"" - the first theatrical edition) that introduced me to the entire series.

As for my recommendations concerning the inclusion of the American remake as a companion to this film? Well -- this gets a bit complicated.

On the one-hand, if you're a real stickler for wanting to get some of the details on the 'back story' and you are unable to acquire any of the original 'V-Cinema' DVDs (especially the very first edition), then I'd say, yeah, go ahead, give it a shot (even though, again, because of the use of newly introduced American actors against a cast of already established Asian characters, some very pertinent story details are going to be overlooked or slightly changed and will not completely offer any satisfactory explanations into why certain key characters in the movie are the targets of ghostly rage, which will result in a slightly different interpretation from what you would get from watching the original series).

However, if you watch this film and fall immensely in love with it (as so many of us have), but you have those nagging doubts about wanting to see ANY remake after witnessing the dog-awful treatment given to the [quote/unquote] 'remake' of ""Ring"" (the original of which you've also loved)-- and especially if you're a huge fan of ""Honogurai Mizu no Soko Kara"" and have seen the trailer for the [quote/unquote] 'remake' of that one called ""Dark Water"" and are just appalled at what is being done to it even this early in the production phase --then I honestly can't say whether or not I could recommend the remake under those circumstances. Again, because of my own personal biases & preferences, I have decided not to include it in my own personal collection simply because it doesn't 'look & feel' quite right to me -- which is NOT to say that the Raimi/Shimizu remake is necessarily a bad film by any means, because, again, like I've said earlier, this is the closest thing to a true ""remake"" I have seen that has been labeled as such since 1990's ""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD"" (not counting Van Sant's ""PSYCHO,"" which was more of a ""re-SHOOT"" than a remake). So if you want to see what a truly ""FAITHFUL"" remake of an Asian film looks like that doesn't take unnecessary ""liberties"" with source material, then the remake (""THE GRUDGE"") just might work for you as well -- but you MAY want to rent it first, just to be on the safe side.

As for recommending this film, ""JUON"" -- no problems recommending it whatsoever. Just be forewarned that like most Asian ""vengeful spirit"" stories, it's not going to be the most terrifying experience you've ever had -- the suspenseful build-ups are going be long, slow and involving. But if you enjoy a lot of 'tension' and 'atmosphere' and not a whole lot of bloodshed with your horror or ghost stories, then there's not much of a chance you can go wrong with this one -- (Dumbed-down, SFX-addicted ""Hollywood Zombies"" need not apply)!",1106438400,6,11361,4.929430214323053

1523172,4,B00005JNJR,"A super-creepy entry into the Japanese horror hall of fame.  Comparisons to Ringu are inevitable, but Ju-on packs in many more conventional scares (and much more overt violence) than either Ringu or its US remake.  And in my view, frankly, the creepiness stays with you a lot longer.

Westerners sometimes have difficulty with the often non-linear (or even non-logical) plots of asian films.  Ju-on, while having a very complicated timeline, is much more concrete in explaining what is happening and why than many Japanese horror films, and it manages this without losing the deep subconscious unease generated by the best horror.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite bridge the gap - it gives you just enough explanation so that you expect to know what is going on, but not quite enough for you to really make sense of things, which is somewhat frustrating and even distracting.

Its a haunted house story, but the ghosts are not confined to this small house in Japan; the spirits sort of ""Lock On"" to anyone that gets in their sights.

The scares are quite good, even when you know that they are coming. The story is not told in straight chronological order, which was an interesting touch to me but may be off-putting for some viewers (its not ""Memento"" level: an insane order of events in a movie).

1523176,1,B00005JNJR,"Given the recent box office success of ""The Grudge,"" many film fans will doubtless be interested in checking out ""Ju-on"",  the Japanese film from which the former movie was remade.

As was the case with ""The Ring,"" another U.S. remake of a Japanese horror film, I've heard many moviegoers describe the Japanese original as the superior film.  I have not seen ""The Grudge"" so I am not in a position to compare and contrast the two films.  I have seen ""Ju-on"" and in my opinion it is far from a masterpiece.  In fact, I found the film to be a pretentious, confusing, muddled mess.

At it's heart, ""Ju-on"" draws on one of the oldest of horror film traditions, the haunted house story.  Here a brutal crime was committed years ago and a vengeful spirit now preys on anyone who enters the home.  Director Takashi Shimizu (who interestingly enough, also directed ""The Grudge"")does a good job of establishing a suitably creepy vibe and early on the film exudes a palpable sense of menace even during daylight scenes which is quite a feat.

But the film quickly devolves into incomprehensibility.  Shimizu follows a long-standing tradition of some Japanese directors who believe mood and visual style should take a front seat to character development and a coherent plot.  As a fan of Japanese cinema, I don't mind this when it's done to good effect.  For example, the sixties-era Yakuza films of director Seijun Suzuki(""Tokyo Drifter,"" ""Branded to Kill"") are good examples of this and are among my favorites.  But Shimizu  doesn't pull it off.

The film jumps from various points in time and from character to character.  This often makes it difficult to follow.  Furthermore,  because the movie never bothers to focus on any one character for an extended period of time, we never become invested in any of them.  They are ultimately memorable only as victims who are lined up for slaughter.  We don't care about what happens to them because we don't get a chance to get to know them.

My advice: if you are interested in exploring Asian horror, you're better off checking out Hideo Nakata's ""Ringu,"" the source for material for  ""The Ring"" or Danny Pang and Oxide Pang Chun's suspenseful  ""The Eye"" which is also slated for a Hollywood remake(Tom Cruise's production company is reportedly producing).  Both films offer more enjoyable viewing experiences and are good primers for those interested in Asian horror films.

Otherwise, be forewarned that if you buy this film you my wind up with a grudge against yourself for not having the savvy to rent it before you bought.",1104192000,4,2565,4.841379310344828

Rather, the film consists of several narratives as seen through the eyes of the folks who either live in or visit the house and what happens to them as a result.  Most of the time you learn what becomes of them; other times you draw your own conclusions based on what has become of other characters.  Moreover, you're not given enough time to become seriously attached to any particular character as each one generally meets his or her demise rather quickly.  So if you're into the traditional horror flick-the hero/heroine discovers the ghosts, tries and fails repetitively to defeat them upon discovering why they exist, only to triumph and survive in the end-this film is not for you.  No happy endings, no neatly-packaged conclusions.  If you have an undying need for resolution-look elsewhere.  In fact, there's a sense that the horror will continue long after the film has ended.  As for the lack of character attachment, I don't believe we as viewers are supposed to become attached to them; rather, we should focus on the spirits' rage and the destruction this rage wreaks on anyone who comes in contact with it.

An aspect that many viewers may find perplexing are the jumps in time.  You may have to watch the film more then once just to comprehend them.  However, I believe that Shimizu incorporates these time shifts to emphasize further the enduring power which the curse possesses.

The final ending, rather trite and typical for horror films, was salvaged by the preceding images of the deserted town in which the house resides, somewhat suggesting that the spirits have succeeded in destroying everyone.

Overall, I liked the film well enough that it has stimulated a desire to see the other three in the series, if I can find them  locally.  One other thing-this film manages to be fairly frightening without all the gore(except for the first shot)of most horror films; the spirits' visages are disturbing enough to keep you watching despite the fact that some of the narratives tend to mimic each other in action.

  If you do decide to view this movie, just a suggestion to enhance the creepiness-watch it alone, late at night, with all lights extinguished.  You won't be sorry. Or perhaps you will.",1101513600,9,2813,4.79045643153527
1523205,2,B00005JNJR,"Meh.  The Japanese original of the haunted-house horror film, ""The Grudge,"" seems for the most part rich in concept and iffy in execution.  Then, in the end, it turns out the conceptual end wasn't so hot, either.  I've seen some comments where the episodic plotting was hard to follow... Not really; it's just that there isn't much of a payoff at the end.  Some of the imagery and staging is quite suspenseful, but the sparse special effects and stagey acting undercut any genuine scariness, and by the end you're inured to any possible chills the plot might hold.  It's interesting to note one particular thematic similarity between this film and the more popular ""Ringu/The Ring,"" and that's how both hauntings manifest themselves basically as viral infections, plagues that spread from person to person and don't seem to take into account the morality of their victims.  A parable, no doubt, for our modern age of pandemics and paranoia... However, I can't say as this particular flick is really worth the time to watch it.  Not sure if I'd see the remake now, either.",1101513600,5,1071,4.851648351648351
1523206,3,B00005JNJR,"A young social worker named Rika is sent to check on an elderly woman.  When she arrives at the house, Rika finds that the woman is near comatose and a strange young boy is hiding in the closet.  As the story unfolds, numerous people begin to die in mysterious ways.  We also gradually learn more about the boy and the house, both of which seem to play a role in these deaths.  The story is told in an episodic manner, introducing several characters and then depicting how they're related to the tale.

Japanese director Takashi Shimizu made ""Ju-On"" as well as its recent American remake, ""The Grudge.""  Asian horror films have a certain ambience and style that has started to catch on in the US, and some of this flair is present in ""Ju-On.""  Several scenes are genuinely creepy and quite effective, particularly when a woman appears who makes disturbing clicking sounds.  Unfortunately, the directing and acting are somewhat erratic, severely undercutting the movie's effectiveness.  I actually laughed during several scenes, especially during the first 20 minutes.  In addition, several elements of ""Ju-On"" (e.g., the way the female ghost moves) are more than a bit reminiscent of ""Ringu"" (the original version of ""The Ring""), making the movie seem clich&eacute;d and tired.

The movie eventually finds its stride, although it remains somewhat confusing at times.  Furthermore, a miserable ending severely limits the impact of the movie.  Overall, ""Ju-On"" is an average horror film: I enjoyed it and it speeds along at a zippy pace.  However, it's not on a par with other recent, more skillfully made Asian horror films, such as ""Ringu"" or ""The Eye.""",1101427200,22,1653,4.985401459854015
1523207,2,B00005JNJR,"I had wanted to watch the Japanese version first, then the American Remake second, but I did the opposite. All I can say was I am glad I did. I usually prefer the original to most remakes. (I did like the Japanese ""Ringu"", a bit more than the American ""Ring""). In this case I expected to like ""Ju-on, The Grudge"" But unfortunately, I did not simply because it was too confusing. The ending completely lost me.

I understood the Japanese original was low budget film and I was willing to accept there would be less scary and thrilling specially effects. I also knew the storyline would be slightly different and some changes in character presentation would be expected. But what I didn't expect was to be confused as not to know what happened in the end.

Actually, the last 30 minutes of the film didn't make a lot of sense. The whole time/slipping concept was okay, but the way it was shown often made me want to review the scene(s) before since I couldn't figure out where the new scene came from. It jumped about so much that I lost the flow of the story line.

Then there were the holes or bloopers in the story. (Spoiler) Case in point, Mariko, the school teacher says she is going to visit the home of a student that has not come into class since school started. When we find out the student she is referring to is the dead boy Toshio, I have to ask, just who enrolled this child at the school since he has been dead for over five years? If he had been enrolled when he was still alive five years ago, I think the school would have taken his name off the attendance sheets by now.

(Spoiler) And what was with the whole ""peeking through the fingers"" thing. I didn't get that at all. I thought maybe it was a game Toshio and his mother Kayako used to play, something like ""Peek-a-Boo"". Perhaps they were playing it when Toshio's father Takeo, killed his wife. If he killed her in front of his son, then his son continues playing the game even as a ghost.

The story didn't make sense at the end. I didn't even think Rika died until someone pointed out she was killed by the ghost of the husband Takeo. The American remake was easier to follow. If I hadn't watch the American version first, I think I would have understood even less of the story. Having that as a guide helped me.

The story in itself was good, that a house absorbed the horror and curse of previous murders to relive them again and again to new inhabitants. I accepted the fact that persons dwelling in the house would be subject to the curse and killed. But I thought the concept of the curse and ghosts following individuals outside the haunted house and killing them at their work or homes was farfetched.

I was disappointed with Ju-on. I had thought it would be as good as Ringu which I liked, and I had high hopes for this film, but it just didn't deliver.",1100736000,6,2834,4.356060606060606
1523268,3,B00005JNJR,Forget the atrocious American version and watch this original Japanese version instead. A little hard to follow at times but once you get your head around the time fractures (which the American one eased up on--thus making the film more of a bore than a scream) you'll be okay. The Grudge is basically a curse that is born after someone dies a violent death.  All those who come in contact with it are cursed to die - as are their family. The randomness of the movie can either turn you off or draw you in even more. Personally I found it rather creepy and disturbing as you didn't know what was going to happen next. Part 2 is even better.,1100736000,,640,4.333333333333333

The movie manages to give you the chills with some creepy images several times during the movie, but it would have been better if I didn't have to stop and rewatch previously watched scenes repeatedly just to make sense out of what I was watching.  As for the little half naked and apparently also half cat ghost boy that looked like he took a bath in talcum powder, he was not very scary.

1523270,2,B00005JNJR,"I saw the American rendition of The Grudge first and I just watched the Japanese version (after purchasing it from amazon) just an hour ago. This whole thing about Sarah Michelle Gellar ""tainting"" the movie is absolute bull. To my point, the Japanese original was a low-budget project and it's obvious that the director tried his best with the money he had. The American version is BY FAR more sophisticated, refined, and downright scary as all hell. Directed by the same guy, he had more money (and resources) at his disposal in America so he could bring out his ideas more eloquently.

The American storyline is streamlined and less confusing. For instance, the use of time-jumps, for lack of a better term, is better executed in the American version whereas in its Japanese counterpart the time-jumps are just all over the place. Unlike the American version, you can't possibly piece together the Japanese storyline without physically straining something in your cranium.

The suspense and scare elements are lackluster and nothing compared to its American successor. The way they setup the wife that kills everyone was not mysterious at all. The American audience was greeted by a Ring-esque setup where the faces of these characters are barely shown if at all for only a few quick seconds at a time; thus increasing the scare factor the way the sequences were filmed. The Japanese version puts no mystery in the wife at all; her face in plain sight with painfully slow ""scare"" sequences.

I can go on with my gripes, but this would become an essay. There are a few good scares in the movie but it's nothing compared to the American version out in theaters right now. My recommendation is to stay away from the original unless you're a movie analyst or critic or whatever and just see The Grudge with Sarah Michelle Gellar while it's out in theaters (or buy the DVD once it's out and blast the volume on your home theater system). The ""American-ized"" story is easier to follow but just as complex as the Japanese version (wanted to be), the characters can't be confused with each other, and it's by far more scarier (20 times as much). This isn't a testment to American film being better than Japanese film -- this in no way alludes to such a notion. Both movies were directed by the same Director. The only factors that really decided each movie's outcome was the availability of money and resources - the American Grudge did what the Japanese Grudge could not.",1100390400,5,2466,4.770491803278689
1523271,4,B00005JNJR,"I wish I had seen this before seeing The Grudge, or at least have learned more about the background of Ju-On, specifically that there were two films that preceded Ju-On (The Grudge).

For one thing, I would have learned that the Americanization of the film had it completely wrong, even though Takashi Shamizu directed both films. I spent a good portion of this film trying to anneal the two versions, but ultimately realized that I could not and therefore accepted them as separate works of art. Once I did this, my enjoyment for this particular ""Grudge"" grew immensely, although I still couldn't help comparing the American and Japanese version, and wishing that the American version had been truer to its Japanese roots, just like The Ring (from Ringu).

This was a scary film. Not the kind of scary that makes your blood run cold or that makes you jump in your seat - it's the superior form of scary that keeps your eyes glued to the screen watching every minute detail, and upon reaching the denouement, feeling a tremendous amount of sorrow for...well, I can't tell you, or that would be giving it away. This is so non-traditional that it soars above its competition. Sure, parts of it are ambiguous, and we wonder why certain things happen the way they did. But the last few scenes answer those questions if you're paying attention and thinking. That's why I say this is a superior form of ""scary"" - it's cerebral. It gets inside your brain. It paints images that disturb you, and then mollify you, and then introduces actual sequences that leave you disturbed and questioning. That's really the heart of Japanese horror - ambiguity. The answers aren't so much on the screen, but in your mind, and it's up to you to put together the images and sequences as they are presented to formulate a unified whole.

Now, if only I could get my hands on prequels to this: Ju-On (The Curse) and Ju-On (The Curse II) at a reasonable price, but sellers on e-bay seem to think that these movies are Pentagon secrets, if their prices mean anything.

One correction. Ju-On's are zombie like creatures. When one kills another, another Ju-On is created. That's a concept completely absent from the American version. They make it seem like the story of a haunted house, and that's simply not the story.",1100390400,13,2290,4.7175
1523272,2,B00005JNJR,"I liked this movie until the last scene where they f*[ked up the time-line.  The following is the movie's chronology as explained by the disjointed scenes:

1) Beginning of story,

  Toshio's family dies.

2) Two weeks later,

  Mariko and Rika dies.

3) Five years later,

  Old lady's family dies, Rika found alive and in shock in

  house.

4) Five years and a couple of days later,

  Death of policemen and Izumi's father.

5) Seven to ten years later,

  Izumi's hears Rika was found dead a week ago on the radio,

  ***MAJOR TIMELINE ISSUE #2***

  Izumi's dies.

This time line is impossible, and sadly ruins the movie for anyone who notices it.  By the end of the movie all I could think about was ""when the heck did Rika die!!!???""  Which left me not thinking about how scary the movie was which is the reason you watch horror movies.  I had to re-watch this movie by skipping back scene for scene on the dvd just to figure out that it was a screenwriting error and not me missing something.

If you demand that your horror be plausible and conform to the standard ""suspension of disbelief"" necessary to make any fantasy interesting then this movie is going to sorely disappoint you.  If all you care about is the boo factor then this movie may work.  For me it doesn't and sadly it is ruined in the final moments of the film by having Mariko's student turn out to be Toshio and not some other boy, causing a ripple effect in the chronology of the film that cannot be resolved.

1523276,5,B00005JNJR,"When someone dies in the grip of a horrible rage, a curse is born. And that curse consumes the place it touches like a cancer, writhing through the world adjoining its own and killing everything it touches.

And, o, how it kills.

While you may be curious as to how this movie is, I'd make the following suggestion to those of you that might want to watch it.

Before you start reading anyone's thoughts on this movie, you should first ask yourself if you want to see something that's (A) presented intact or if you (B) want to see a beast with some of its proverbial teeth pulled. If you choose ""A"" (and most people choose ""A,"" if you're curious about mean and the like), you should consider the fact that this movie could be ruined if you keep reading people's reviews. Ju-on isn't one of those boorish films that rely heavily on a point that it has to drive into your viewing mind like a hammer hitting some ""look, mommy, I'm a monster"" nail. Instead, it works by telling a story in fragments, letting you have snippets of the tale along with a dose of the horrific and rewarding you as you follow along. It reminds me of a mystery that you know portions of right away because of conjecture/ horror movie conditioning, but one that you have to keep following because of the fun that ensues as little elements (the all-too-human kind) keep touching some base terror and then suffering as they help spread it. And its one of those pieces that you REALLY want to kick people for talking about with any depth, because any portion of the plot being revealed could fracture the effect it has when it's revealed on the screen. The little tastes of depravity, the nuisances that make your spine sink and say ""O my god"" when the lovely effects play out - yeah. You should definitely go out and take it for a ride without listening to the prattle of the masses.

If labels scare you and you need more convincing, then let me say this. As far as comparisons go, this movie has gotten a lot of press that it didn't deserve. It's been called arthouse, implying that it was cheap and that it was abstract, and it's been called ""like Ringu,"" implying that it's a rip-off. But, watching the film (and countless others in the horror genre), I'll have to say that neither of these generalizations apply. Sure, the movie does have places where the monetary constraints show and, sure, it does have a few places where it does cross boundaries with other movies. Still, most horror movies are like that. At its very essence this is a (1) foreign film and falls into certain patterns predicted by what its target audience enjoy, and (2) it is a haunting film and gives you some haunting love. But it has a lot of other things, too, packing some bite for the buck. When it comes down to horror, its one of those evils that simply doesn't let something step on its toes and walk away. O no, it's a whole lot sexier than that.

And, for people that don't know, this is the film that The Grudge was adapted from. Does that mean that you should just go out and see the adaptation and shelf this film? Hell no. Seeing both The Grudge and Ju-on, I'll have to say that I personally preferred the taste of Ju-on. While it didn't have the budget of its counterpart, it did have (1) the unrestricted rating that allowed for some interesting imagery with a box cutter and with the terror itself, (2) an atmosphere that made me cringe in some parts instead of merely jumping at loud noises that perhaps frighten the newly-inducted horror connoisseur but that don't have the edge of a good scare, and (3) the ability to make me want to know the history of the house I'm living in.

The movie presents its story though a series of vignettes, to show how the 'curse' affects different characters that are all somehow involved with the ghosts.  It does so with a fractured non-sequential timeline, that really does not add anything to the movie.

Genuine scares would have made this film able to cross cultures, but most Americans who are honest with themselves, and aren't compelled to try to seem more intelligent than everyone else, won't find it particularly frightening.

For a long time, The Excorcist held the top slot.  Then along came Blair Witch, which I thought did a very good job at inciting that deep-down fear.  But now I have gone and seen Ju-On, and it has wrecked me!  Be careful what you wish for!  Why though?  What exactly is it about this film that is so intensly, deeply frightening?  I don't know if I can put it into words.  Most horror movies use the ""jolt"" tactic for a quick scare, and this one is no exception, yet these are more than jolts.  These are sounds and images that burrow deeply into the mind and stay there, only to come to surface at the most undesirable times (such as the middle of the night).  I have found that the most ordinary household bumps and creeks can now paralyze me, and catching my own reflection out of the corner of my eye as i pass by a window or mirror can suddenly chill me to the marrow and cause the hair on my arms to stand straight up.  I find that my dreams have been haunted as well.  Mostly consisting of ordinary-looking staircases that draw my attention and curiosity, only to find them to be occupied by a croaking, grotesquly twitching pale woman slowly scaling down them like a crab or a bug, toward me...and as much as I need to, I just cannot look away.

I began watching it with the english over-dub, but that was a bit crap so I watched it in original Japanese with subtitles. I could already tell after about 15 minutes that this film was going to be whopper! Excited, I ran and told the other half about how good it was and when I came back down, I rewound it simply to see what I had missed. I was nearly sick. My stomach turned and from that moment I knew I was dealing with the big boys.

Since then the dvd has sat menacingly on the rack in my house and like some disturbed heroin addict in remission, I have teased myself with watching it again. I'll pick it up, but then something bites and reluctanlty but also thankfully I'll return it to where it now sits, hovering behind me.

I live alone (not with my girlfriend) but since that pleasent Saturday afternoon my life has not been the same. I have not slept alone apart from once when I had to get steaming drunk so I could actullay sleep without caring. I won't look under the bed covers, I won't look out of the bed covers, I can't shower in peace, I can't walk up the stairs without all of the house lights on (like that helps!!) I can't even have poo at work in peace without the fear of hearing...that noise.

The thing with ju-on is this. Close your eyes and imagine every safe place you can, every safe situation, every safe person and then imagine there is no hope. Ju-on attacks everything you hold sacred, but not in a violent manner; in a silent and vehement mode. It is the cute child that conceals an uzi behind his back. It is the pizza that has that extra helping of arsenic. It is not horror - it is pure evil.

You owe it to yourself to watch this film. You ought to watch it and I mean ought in its full literal sense. It is a diamond film and a great great deal can be learnt from it. Yet again the Western world, Japan has shown us the way forward - domo arigato!!!",1099699200,13,2214,4.2

1523326,4,B00005JNJR,"I went to see this movie recently with my boyfriend since it was Halloween Night and we were looking for something fun and spooky to do.

Now I will tell you from the start that horror flicks are NOT my thing. I am the biggest ""scaredy-cat"" when it comes to fright films and the brief trailer/description for this film that I read on-line did not give me much confidence going in...

""She hears a strange scratching sound coming from the attic of a catatonic shut-in...AND GOES TO INVESTIGATE??...""

Ahhhhhhh, Creepy! I don't even want to KNOW what is up there or why anyone ELSE wants to figure it out. Well, I guess SOME people DO want to know...

(Even though we all know what they said about Curiosity and that old [black] Cat...)

The film was full of all different degrees of scares and seemed to delight my not-so-scaredy-cat boyfriend (though he turned to show me gooseflesh on his arm at one point in the picture).

I covered my eyes for a lot of it and still had a hard time sleeping last night because of the subtle scares/foreshadowing frights that this movie provided---many that you could not even hope to expect. Wow. Chills.

I thought the film was well-acted, a well-told story, and the special effects were tremendous.

My only criticism would be that I would have liked to see a little more explanation of ""the Grudge"" Ju-On evil dead/undead spirit and it's history and it's powers and etc, etc, etc.

I have always been fascinated with Japanese culture and beliefs and I think this would have made the film even more spooky and even more interesting for it's viewers.

Perhaps that is being saved for a sequel, since another review I just read on www.amazon.com  seems to hint at this as a four story sequel/series. (Do NOT tell my boyfriend, please!)

I have not read the book (and since I'm still trying to get the frightening movie images out of my head in time for bed tonight), I likely will not. So, I am not sure if the book gives more explanation of this aspect of the story/plot line.

The premise is very interesting and very frightening and again, just a good all around scary movie to see, (and not just on the Eve of a Pagan Holiday like Halloween!)

directed by Takashi Shimizu

2003, 92 mins

First things first: there's Ju-On, and there's Ju-On: The Grudge. Ju-On: The Grudge is a remake of plain Ju-On, with a different cast and a bigger budget, but the same director. This review concerns Ju-On: The Grudge, as the original Ju-On has not been released here (sadly, because it has Chiaki Kuriyama in it). That taken care of, let's carry on to the review itself.

Movies don't often really scare me. The Exorcist? Pssh. The Shining? Meh. However, I was caught off-guard when I saw Ringu for the first time. Now this was scary! I mean, just imagine this creepy girl coming crawling out of your TV! That was the first time I regretted watching horror movies in the middle of the night, in the dark, all by myself. I watched several more Asian horror movies after Ringu, including all the spin-offs and whatever, but none of them seemed to be able to come anywhere near Ringu. That was, until I got my hands on Ju-On. I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, the night I watched this movie, I almost wet my pants.

How come? I don't know. The movie in itself is not really special, to be honest. The acting is quite okay, and the technical aspects, nothing wrong with them. The story lacks, to say the least. But is it scary? Oh my shizzle, yes. This movie is loaded with scenes that are just too creepy for words. I could of course spoil them, but that takes away the, well, 'fun' of it. You should just see for yourself and get scared (or not, since some people apparently don't find it scary at all; they find The Exorcist much scarier *coughs*). I'll tell you this: since I watched this movie, I always turn on the lights before looking into a mirror. Hella, I don't believe in ghosts or anything, but crap, Ju-On really got to me. Evil Dead couldn't breed any fear for mirrors-in-the-dark here, but Ju-On could. Therefore, I praise it.

Oh yeah, the make up looks like crap.

Scares? 100/10

Gore? 2/10 (blood-soaked ghost-women count)

Scary kids? 1/1

1523410,5,B00005JNJR,"I am a long-time fan of Horror.  I have not enjoyed many recent American Horror for some time - save for Freddy vs Jason which is directed by a Hong Kong Director.... I have recently been collecting Japanese Horror and place this series of films (there are 4)at the top; That and DARK WATER.  Yes there is a feel of the RING in it, but these are ""Ghost stories"", not slasher films.  If you want more blood then start with tracking down the first - JU-ON the Curse, the Grudge is the 3rd.  I have not seen movies that have ""freaked-me-out"" like this since THE CHANGELING with George C. Scott. If you did not like the RING (Japanese), then you may not like this either.  They are similar in style and this style is popular in Horror from Japan.  If you are not familiar with Japanese shows or movies, it can be troubling to see the flow of the parts due mostly to Japanese names, as they are connected by the characters relations to one another... this may seem confusing to those who cannot remember which character Kazumi is and so on... my mother is also a fan of horror and she remembers this as her favorite as well.",1098748800,15,1119,4.330143540669856
1523411,5,B00005JNJR,"I really liked this movie...actually better than Ringu. It seems pretty obvious to me after reading all the reviews, which people actually were aware that this was a remake or even aware that it was the same director as Ringu (which would explain the similarities). I like that the movie doesn't have some retarded American happy ending and sticks to it's original Japanese roots. I think it would've been awful if they tried to change the movie too much to appeal to more close-minded viewers (such as in the area I live in unfortunately). For those of you who were upset that there was no ending....there is a sequel so no need to panic about not knowing what happened.

All in all...great movie, would definitely watch it again and own it on dvd (the original of course).",1098662400,6,774,4.649635036496351
1523412,3,B00005JNJR,"I'm going to skip all the ring/ringu similarties and just talk about how this compares to the US remake starring Sarah Michelle Gellar.

This version is less refined.  Parts are more thoughtful and insightful, but it is basically the same movie wrapped in a different cover.  I liked the Sarah version much more for obvious reasons (Buffy is queen?...come on!) but this is still an entertaining flick that I recommend for those who loved the remake.

p.s.  Go Sarah!  Congrats on a great opening weekend!",1098576000,3,504,4.870588235294117
1523413,4,B00005JNJR,"I haven't made up my mind whether I will go see ""The Grudge,"" Takashi Shimizu's English-language remake of his ""Ju-on."" I understand that ""The Grudge"" is identical almost shot-by-shot to ""Ju-on,"" except for different actors and more expensive special effects. Frankly, I'm not sure better special effects would make this film any scarier than it is already. ""Ju-on"" is cheesy-looking; its haunted house is a drab, cramped suburban Tokyo row house, and the other sets in the film--a hospital, a police station, a couple of tiny apartments--are equally dreary. But the claustrophobia of the sets only adds to the terror of the story about a vengeful family of ghosts that attacks anyone who comes anywhere near its aura. The ghosts can travel through the cheap prefab walls, but for the film's characters, those walls are death traps. Shimizu's episodic, elliptical method of storytelling--the story apparently spans several years, and covers a half-dozen groups of characters--is confusing; but one could argue that the circular story adds to the audiences' sense of dislocation. ""Ju-on,"" greatly to its credit, refuses to play by the traditional ghost-movie rule that once you've escaped the haunted house, you've also escaped the ghost. This ratchets up the terror exponentially. And the ghosts' makeup, while undeniably cheap-looking, is in perfect sync with the film's dank atmosphere of impending doom. ""Ju-on"" is no masterpiece, but it succeeds very well in its intended purpose of scaring an audience out of its wits.",1098489600,3,1523,5.297520661157025
1523414,4,B00005JNJR,"I rented Ju-on: The Grudge because its American remake is coming out, and I wanted to sample the original without prejudice before the marketing assault of the remake robs me of that chance. I wasn't expecting much however, figuring it to be in the same vein as the original Ringu, which wasn't all that scary. Ditto the American remake. Of course, I am wrong as usual. From the very first scenes, you can tell there is a skillful director at work. Takashi Shimizu easily concocted the mood and atmosphere that a hack like Brett Ratner can only dream of. And the film is actually scary, not the cheap oh-it's-a-cat type of scare either but genuine fears of what is happening on screen. The structure of the story is interesting too, told episodically without chronological order, it actually asks for audience participation instead of hosing us down with its plot. Other things conspire to elevate the film high above the norm, like the masterful use of sound effects and suggestions of what is behind closed doors. The only mistakes are a sometimes illogical behaviors from its characters and the overexposure of the many vengeful spirits late in the film. They are not fatal, but the film would have been perfect without them. Anyways, if you thought Ringu was scary, you ain't see nothing yet.",1098489600,6,1296,4.816143497757848
1523415,3,B00005JNJR,"This movie is not scary. It offers some suspense that gets monotonous after a short while. There were instances that were startling, though they had potential to be more so. The supposedly scary characters look too realistic and I hear (and have seen in previews) that these same characters are done better in the American version... which brings me to the Ring and Ringu: if you've seen those two then you will understand when i say that The Grudge japanese version is to its american version as ringu is to the ring. In both cases american version is scarier and done better overall. Plus if you watch this first part you would pretty much half to watch the other parts (grudge 2, the curse, etc...) as this does not explain much or wrap things up.",1098403200,2,750,4.562962962962963

WHY DON'T YOU STOP  RECYCLING WHAT OTHERS HAVE ALREADY DONE AND COME UP WITH YOUR OWN IDEAS FOR A CHANGE!!!!!!!!!!!! That being said i was not all that interested in seeing this movie because, number 1 it had subtitles, and number 2 i didn't enjoy the American version because  It  was very slow moving and boring.  But i had nothing else to watch so I decided to watch ju - on,  on tv.  I was very happy that i did this movie is really interesting and really catches your attention from the beginning. I already had an idea about what it was going to be about from seeing the remake, but this was much better. I usually don't like movies with subtitles but you  don't even notice that you have to read subtitles because they make it so easy to understand what is going on. Unlike the remake it gets right into the movie. You don't waist time with pointless scenes that have nothing to do with the movie at all. I don't think i would call it a horror movie more suspence but still a very awesome movie. As soon as it was  over I purchased it on amazon instant video. Thats how much i liked it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has seen the remake, really watch both and then see which you think is better.
