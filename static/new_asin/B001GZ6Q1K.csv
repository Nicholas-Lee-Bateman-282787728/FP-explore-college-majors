The original interviews went for over 28 hours, this DVD lasts only 2, but it does cover the most interesting aspects of Watergate and how Nixon was able to justify everything in his own mind.

3622198,4,B001GZ6Q1K,"Some will be disappointed at the running time of 88 minutes of this version of the Frost/Nixon interviews but that is because it touches
on Watergate only (hence the title 'The Original WATERGATE Interviews)and not the other issues on such subject matters as Vietnam,China,abuse of powers and his final days as stated on the back cover of the DVD.However,the 88 minutes that we do get is simply gripping and fascinating. Frost is thorough and fierce in his conduction of the interview,so much so he tosses his clip board aside at one point as Nixons eyes follow the toss and then smirks. Another amazing moment is when Nixon becomes emotional at one point and is clearly teary eyed.

The 38 yr. old Frost appears to be absolutely sleep deprived judging by the bags under his eyes as big as tea bags is seen as very eager to hear Nixons answers to his questions that at another point he grabs a glass of water and raises it to his lips as fast as I've ever seen one approach a glass of water and then proceeds to put it down even faster as if he doesn't want to miss one second or waste one second of his prize catch of his career in Richard Milhous Nixon. Mr. Nixon,a man who professes and claims in his view to Frost that he believes he did not commit an impeachable offense.

3622201,5,B001GZ6Q1K,"This is an outstanding historical and political dvd with journalist David Frost and former President Richard Nixon. The interviews were conducted in 1977, three years after Nixon resigned the presidency in 1974.

It helps to understand the interviews much more if you were around back then, when Wategate was television and newspaper headlines in 1972 through to when Nixon resigned in 1974. Also, if you are history and political enthusiast this could be of great interest.

Frost was not known for heavy hitting investigative journalism when he acquired this project. The interviews with Nixon allowed him to move up a step in the news field. As for Nixon, it appears that he wanted an opportunity to re-emerge from the distance of resignation and the attempt to re-enter the public and political stage. Also the money he earned from the interviews was big at the time, this also probably motivated Nixon to work on this project.

Frost does a masterful job at asking the questions, and it becomes clear in time that Frost has done a significant amount of research on Watergate and Nixon's role in the entire Watergate scenario. I got the sense that Nixon may not have fully understood that Frost had done his research so well.

Nixon was both gracious and stern to Frost during the interviews. Nixon seems to use lawyer terms, incorrect legal premises and debate tactics during the exchanges. Nixon also seems to stumble a few times, but eventually gets on track with his version of events.

Nixon's answers to the questions, at times, simply don't hold up when they discuss obstruction of justice, criminal intent, motive and when he knew of the break-in. Simply put, it is very interesting to watch this exchange and how both Frost and Nixon act and react to questions, answers and discussion.

Also of great interest is the thought process and events that Nixon reveals in his handling of the Wategate situation and the termination of his long time assistants, H.R. Halderman and John Erlichman.

Nixon continues to dodge the questions through-out the interviews. Nixon, was of course in an uphill struggle wth this interview. Frost had done his research very well and the White House tapes/""transcripts"" and John Dean's memory are too much to explain away.

As a viewer, you may also get a better sense of Nixon's personality, his humor, speech patterns, facial gestures, physical movements, hand gestures, his reflections on subjects and people involved in his political career.

The Frost Nixon interviews are well worth the price and give great insight into one of the greatest political downfalls in our life time.

3622205,4,B001GZ6Q1K,"These interviews by David Frost of Richard Nixon were very interesting, but failed to really pull me in until the last 20 minutes, when Frost asks Nixon to make three admissions -- of wrongdoing in the cover-up of Watergate, of abuse of office, and putting the US through two years of unnecessary suffering by not resigning earlier.

I won't give away Nixon's response, but it gets pretty powerful right up through the end. You can see that both men were overwhelmed by the moment. Frost is clearly shaken, even as he tries to manipulate Nixon into making a heart-rending admission, and Nixon looks at one point almost like he was in anguish and ready to give in. And in the end, maybe he does, for all intents and purposes.

A lot of the interviews up to that final question deal with the minutia of who did what when, and what Nixon knew on specific dates. Frost was hitting Nixon with quotes from transcripts, in a lawyerly fashion, and at one point Nixon acknowledges explicitly that Frost was playing the role of prosecutor. These parts of the interview were a bit dull for me as I'm not a Watergate buff. I used to know more about the details, but I have long since forgotten them.

3622208,5,B001GZ6Q1K,"Apparently some things will not remain in the bottle. That appears to be the case with one Richard Milhous Nixon, one time President of the United States, certified demon and off-handedly a common criminal. Just when you though it was safe to go outdoors to get a little fresh air here he rises again to scare the bejesus out of another generation of idealistic young people and send his old time political opponents, including this reviewer, screaming in the night. What has brought on the fear?

Well, for one the recent notoriety around the movie ""Frost/Nixon"", the ""story"" behind the celebrated attempt by Nixon to `help' rewrite the second draft of history on his presidency and for Frost to leap-frog to the front of the journalist pantheon. That is what I thought I had bargained for when I ordered up what I assumed was a copy of the movie. What I got was far, far worst, a copy of the original Watergate segments of the original Frost/Nixon television interviews from 1977. I will, eventually, after my pulse returns to normal, get a copy of the movie and review that in this space but for now I will make a few comments on this little documentary gem.

As fate would have it I have recently been reading (or rather re-re-reading) ""Dr. Gonzo"" journalist Hunter S. Thompson's compilation volume entitled ""The Great Shark Hunt"". Included in the selections were a series of articles that Thompson did for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine from his ""mythical"" National Affairs Desk at the time of the Nixon-era Watergate hearings in 1974. Thompson, not afraid to deride Nixon when he was riding high was more than willing to skewer him on his way down. To give a flavor of the times, of Thompson's appreciation of what the name Nixon meant to our generation and the importance of exposing that little crook to the clear light of day (something that, unfortunately, never really happened as he ran down some rat hole) I am reposting the concluding paragraph from a review I did of his ""Songs Of The Doomed"" in 2006:

""As a member of the generation of 1968 I would note that this was a period of particular importance which won Hunter his spurs as a journalist. Hunter, like many of us, cut his political teeth on one Richard Milhous Nixon, at one time President of the United States and all- around political chameleon. Thompson went way out of his way, and with pleasure, skewering that man when he was riding high. He was moreover just as happy to kick him when he was down, just for good measure. Nixon represented the `dark side' of the American spirit- the side that appears today as the bully boy of the world and as craven brute. If for nothing else Brother Thompson deserves a place in the pantheon of journalistic heroes for this exercise in elementary political hygiene. Anyone who wants to rehabilitate THAT man before history please consult Thompson's work. Hunter, I hope you find the Brown Buffalo wherever you are. Read this book. Read all his books.""

And that last sentence kind of says it all. Probably from the minute that he resigned in disgrace in August 1974 Nixon began his little campaign to ""rehabilitate"" himself and move up in the presidential pecking order from dead last to at least beat the likes of James Buchanan and Millard Fillmore. He should not have bothered. His grilling by the well-prepared Frost (who had his own personal agenda in getting involved in this project) was as full of self-justifications, obfuscations, down right balderdash and melodramatic nonsense as one could take in an hour and one half presentation.

Even three years later he still didn't get it. The basic premise that Nixon and his staff worked under while president was that of the ""divine right of kings"" a theory discredited a couple of centuries ago. But why go on. Whether you want to view this little film as horror, humor or hubris do not, and I repeat do not, do it while you are depressed about the state of the world. As noted above- Be forewarned this film is not for the faint-hearted. Parental Guidance is very definitely suggested for all concerned.",1244764800,,4071,4.728169014084507

One must read titles!
I got this as a companion to Ron Howard's recent Frost/Nixon movie, (which I highly recommend) wherein the viewer sees that there were a series of interviews - the first of which, from a news/historical record standpoint, were triumphs for the evasive Tricky Dick and nightmares for the serious staff underwriting the dandy dillitante Frost.
Those preliminary interviews are not here. DUH! That's why it's called ""The Original WATERGATE Interviews."" But Frost came on strong and redeemed himself for posterity in what you will see here - just don't expect ""the whole 10 yards.""

3622210,4,B001GZ6Q1K,"""Watergate"" will resonate with any person who even has a passing interest in politics and the historic Sir David Frost/Richard Nixon interviews from May 1977 made for compelling TV then and now.

This is the ""Watergate"" portion of the interviews, with additional bonus commentary/relections by Frost. Nixon had agreed to appear on camera with no pre-interview preparation or screening of questions and the subtle jousting between Frost and the disgraced former president is quite evident.

To review the circustances and to see Nixon answer these questions now brings on a whole new light to the time and circumstances. Particularly now that I am more politically aware and hold a postion of leadership and decision making in the public sector. And then to be able to compare Nixon to Clinton and the Bush family, back to Reagan and the Iran/Contra deal. It was just great.

However, Nixon does an amazing job of repeatedly denying any criminal or moral wrongdoing.

3622216,5,B001GZ6Q1K,"This is a movie I told myself that I could skip, because the format alone seemed to suggest that it could not be pulled off successfully. Plus, today with the theaters being flooded with so many bad movies, why take a chance?  Yet, this movie's allure proved to be too enticing, and after having seen it, it also proves that in the hands of a skilled director, anything good (even with a bad vehicle) can happen. From now on I will be selecting my movies by directors, and no longer by actors.

The plot of the movie hangs on the 29 hours of Frost/Nixon Interviews that took place over 12 days, and were first aired in 1977. In the subtext of these interviews, it turns out to have been hidden a heavyweight championship bout between the two reigning intellectual giants and champions on either side of the media divide, for our times.

In one corner was little David Frost, who in his youth could have easily devoured a Goliath the likes of Richard Nixon. But David was no longer young. He had started to grey around the temples, and now was scrambling like old fighters are won't to do, trying to save his life, his reputation, and to recap a little of the past glory and a few of the much needed and waning dollars that used to flow through his hands like so much water. The odds were strongly against a comeback for this ""has been David""-- a journalist, reporter and talk show host.

In the other corner was Richard Milhous Nixon, old ""tricky Dick"" himself, the last lion of the republican establishment, a veritable political Goliath, a survivor of many battles in which he was all but down for the ten count. Here he was, a warrior at eighty, robust, fit and sassy, egging and angling for a fight: for him the younger and more virile the opponent, the better. At stake were his legacy, his reputation and a rewriting of history to reflect his version of the events of the Watergate scandal.

Make no mistake about it, even though we already knew the outcome, this was political high-jinks at its best, the grand intellectual battle of our times, on par with the Scopes Monkey Trial, or the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Here was the last time we would ever get to see in the grand arena of public opinion Nixon ""dancing like a butterfly and stinging like a bee "" -- and little David Frost, loading his slingshot just one more time. One could not believe the excitement and tension conjured up by this artificially contrived battle royal of a movie.

The signature scene was almost assuredly apocryphal. It was a call by a drunken Nixon to Frost in the wee hours of the night. In his slurred soliloquy to Frost, Nixon laid all his marbles on the table and told Frost that he'd better bring everything he had, because he would need it.  Nixon made on mistake about it, this was a fight to the death. He then wished Frost well; hung up the phone and promptly forgot that the phone call ever took place.

These two timeless gladiators squared off in the main arena for the last time to fight it out on TV to the death. Only one would come out alive, and with his reputation intact. Nixon was the defensive expert. He knew how to ""slip punches,"" ""hit below the belt,"" lie, and steal, when necessary: how to bob-and-weave, ""stick and jab,"" and dance away, sapping the energy of much younger and stronger opponents. He did so ever so skillfully throughout the movie. That was what he did. That was what he had spent his whole forty years as a politician learning how to do. There were few tricks in the trick book that ""old Tricky Dick"" did not know. There was no one better at using slime to defeat an opponent. Nixon did not get the monocle ""tricky Dick"" for no reason. He was the consummate political street fighter, and for the first two thirds of the movie, he had Frost on the ropes.

But Frost had a few tricks of his own up his sleeve, and trapped Nixon in a neutral corner and banged away at his weakest point, his betrayal of the American people. The old lion fought heroically but in the end caved, exhausted by a more clever, younger, opponent.

Intellectual dramas do not get much better than this. Five Stars.",1234137600,,4117,4.477333333333333

I watched much of them while a college student and really want to see the entire set (especially with 32 years of hindsight).  Watergate is actually such a small (albeit critical) part of Nixon's presidency, and the part that is clearly remembered the most.  But his 5.5 years in office were an extraordinary piece of US history.  When he took office, the Vietnam ""Conflict"" started by JFK and LBJ was at it's height as was the US economy.  When Nixon resigned, the US was out of Vietnam and the economy was a wreck (for unrelated reasons).  In between were the opening in China, the conversion of the South from the Democratic to the Republican party, the rise to military dominance of the Soviet Union, Kent State, and so much more.

I can only hope that the producers of this slice of the interviews go ahead and release the entire set on DVD.  No one but David Frost and such a complex persona like Nixon could have yielded so many hours of engaging interviews.  A movie about the interviews is up for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

8307451,5,B001GZ6Q1K,"David Frost Interviews Richard Nixon a.k.a. The Nixon Interviews were a series of interviews of former United States President Richard Nixon conducted by British journalist David Frost. They were recorded and broadcast on television in four programs in 1977.

After his resignation in 1974, Nixon spent more than two years away from public life. In 1977, he granted Frost an exclusive series of interviews. Nixon was already publishing his memoirs at the time; however, his publicist Irving ""Swifty"" Lazar believed that by using television Nixon could reach a mass audience. In addition, Nixon was going through a temporary cash flow problem with his lawyers, and needed to find a quick source of income.

This is probably one of the most brilliant interviews conducted ever to a former President of the United States. It presents to us the real and true Richard Nixon. David Frost was also spectacular as the interview as he was able to obtain answers to question in a forthright manner.

And of course,who could forget the classic Nixon quote when Frost asked the former President about the legality of the president's actions,""Well, when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.""
