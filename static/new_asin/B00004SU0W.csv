7922113,5,B00004SU0W,I used this book when I first started teaching fast pitch softball. Had played slow pitch for years but when my daughter got old enough to play they were into fast pitch.  I found this very helpful to teach her the proper technique.,1358899200,,232,4.395348837209302
7922114,2,B00004SU0W,"I bought this thinking I could teach my daughter how to pitch.  There's so many things that affect a pitch that aren't covered or only touched on.  The kid in this video obviously already knows how to pitch.  You can get a few tips on how to pitch, but you're only going to be a little better than someone who just swings their arm in a circle and releases the ball.  My advice is to save your money, find someone who teaches pitching, and spend your money there.  My daughter learned more in one lesson with a live coach than watching this video several times, writing down what should be done, and analyzing the pitcher's motion in slow motion.  A coach can give you immediate feedback, corrections, and drills to improve your pitching.  Save your money on these videos.  (I bought a couple others and never got my money's worth out of them.)  Sorry Ernie.",1177113600,,858,4.483870967741935
