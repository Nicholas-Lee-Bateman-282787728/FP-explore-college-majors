8109371,1,B000EGDC32,"Don't waste your money on this one. Rather than being an overview of ""ancient Jerusalem"", this DVD concentrates on the Second (Herodian) Temple and the over-hyped Ark of the Covenant. The graphics are poor and misused (there's a repeated use of Herod's Temple purporting to be Solomon's). There's got to be a better handling of this subject on the market.",1267833600,6,355,4.933333333333334
8109372,4,B000EGDC32,This documentary has better quality than A&E's Ancient Mysteries: The Lost Ark of Covenant. And this has computer remodeling of ancient Jerusalem and the temples along with its very interesting history. You can see mostly from Israel's side though.,1165363200,8,248,5.384615384615385
