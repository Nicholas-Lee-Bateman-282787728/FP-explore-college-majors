7736237,4,B01EIW2RMO,"Lucky star is an absolutely hilarious show, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a light-hearted anime.  However, there are 3 reasons I am not giving this 5 stars and it is now the show, but the box.

First of all the dvds have almost no art on them except for the 5th one for whatever reason, which is just plain awkward.  The case is decently done, but I would have preferred a bit larger case so the dvds could be on their own versus almost being on top of one another.

And the real reason I'm irritated is my second disc is messed up and freezes part-way through the 1st episode on that disc.  This causes you to miss about a minute of the show, and while that's not necessarily to big of a deal I hate it when this happens to me after buying an official release.  This is what I expect from bootleg copies.",1271376000,,821,4.132075471698113
7736238,5,B01EIW2RMO,"Like many I enjoyed the series through Youtube or...alternative means. My anime tastes aren't very complex. I typically only watch comedies, and for me to actively seek a dvd/boxset purchase is a compliment in and of itself. To date the only other box set i've purchased is Azumanga Daioh and a few of the Miyazaki films (including Ponyo).

Lucky Star is one of the few on my ""made it"" list. I tried many times to purchase each individual dvd at approx $20 each. But I couldn't do it. At 6 volumes plus the OVA, that's ~$130, which is the cost of many brand new box sets with additional swag and a nice box to store it in.

No thanks.

This past saturday I attended Sakura-Con here in Seattle, and a few vendors were selling this product for retail, apparently before it hits the streets on the 6th of April (according to amazon).

Besides it being a great purchase, there isn't much to say about it. Formatted in widescreen, and looks gorgeous on the PS3 (which I assume does some up converting).

There isn't much detail on the DVDs themselves except for the 5th one, which is printed from edge to edge and looks alot more polished, like something you would find in a standalone retail box.

Anyway, even at retail price, this is a must buy. Amazon bringing it at below cost at release is a godsend for any anime fan, particularly those who were miffed that they never released a true box set.",1270425600,26,1395,4.47244094488189
7736239,5,B01EIW2RMO,"Just join in on the fun. If you like Azumanga Daioh and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya you will probably really enjoy this. Imagine combining the two into one series. You have the girls in school with the attitude of Haruhi. It is not your typical anime.

This series was given it's weird art style to throw people off so the children look slightly more innoncent, but they say really crazy things. Like Azumanga it follows some girls in school, but Haruhi these girls will say whatever is on their mind. So leave behind your sanity, watch in pure amazement and listen to the insanity as these girls talk about anime, videogames, school life, and sex appeal.

School Rumble is along a similair line as well. Honostly it's really enjoyable, but it is not intended for the younger viewers, so you may not want to watch it with the little ones. If you enjoy crazy animes though, this one will leave you in stitches. I enjoyed watching this and with the collection you get all of it at once. It's hard to pass up.",1269734400,7,1012,4.494565217391305

Lol. But to be serious, we have been asking for it to be made available. It was on YouTube for a time, but then all of them were forced down. But Funimation didn't make it available for streaming on their site and didn't sell any sets. So we been asking for a long time.
Now, Funimation has made the series available on their site for members following this set's release, but I wanted to make sure I had this when I got the chance!
My all-time favorite anime series of all time! The original cast and English Dub are both fabulous and I never really like the dub better than the original but the dub is just so great!

Funimation messed up with the outer slipcover showing 1080p but the inner cover showing 1080i.  After watching this on my Sony Blu-ray player and Sony TV I will say that the video quality is an improvement over the old Bandai DVDs, strong colors with no notable artifacts or jagged lines, but it lacks the overall sharpness of 1080p video.

The set is fairly basic with the just the slipcover and a reversible cover, but it does save a lot of space compared to the old DVD singles.

Overall, I'm happy with the set, but Funimation needs to get its act together with these little screw-ups.",1470009600,2,676,4.56198347107438

I know its an old anime but im sure it could have been handled better, in a way im glad i finally own the collection but im not sure if the japanese blu ray set has the same issues to begin.

I know the haruhi blu ray set is perfect but im worried if the new funimation re release will have the same issues as this re release so im giving it a 3 just because i can at least say that i own the original set (dvds included in this set)  at a good price on while the blu ray discs are a complete let down.

I uploaded some pictures comparing the quality.

In the last picture if you zoom in you can see jaggies on the hair of everyone and they are just sitting down you might say well is not that bad but the problem is even more notice able once they start moving which is all the time.

the haruhi blu ray re release got treated better and that anime is older than lucky star....... Anyway just wanted to make a quick update",1469145600,26,1173,3.9491525423728815

7736260,5,B01EIW2RMO,"Just got it in and boy, oh boy, am I happy to own it!
As some long time fans may know, Lucky Star became a hit and later down the road, was released in a ""Anime Legends"" collection from Bandai. However, Bandai no longer releases western anime and the Lucky Star Anime Legends is now out of print, making Lucky Star a difficult and expensive collection to own. But thanks to Funimation, it's back and everybody who couldn't own the series now has a chance: in Blu-Ray and DVD with the OVA!

Like previous reviews here, it is indeed not a very slick HD make-over, but most anime will be like that due to its age. If you are nor a serious nitpicker, you will enjoy the heck out of this package. It features both Dub and Sub and everything you love about in Lucky Star. And the Dub is the original Dub, which is a really good cast.

Some people ask if the OVA is dubbed this time and sadly, it isn't. But it doesn't take the enjoyment away.

If you love Lucky Star or want to try it and own it for the heck of it, this is a good product to own. It's a Slice-of-Life anime to not be taken to serious and fun to watch for a relaxing day.",1468454400,2,1131,4.062780269058296

I love lucky star but this release is just a horrible mess. The video quality is just awful artifacts around the characters and signs of upscaling why? It looks like they had a bad source and tried upscaling, added sharpening and then they tried to smooth it over. I understand people are happy that this is out but Christ have some standards they literally just put SD sources on a blu ray disc and said its 1080p.",1468281600,24,566,4.504854368932039

I'm so impressed,I won't knock it down but, I'm using a PS4 and a sony 850c tv and watching the episodes however, it doesn't look as HD, as they did on websites. It's odd, but I still think the box set was so worth it. Wish, they only had it in blu ray only. No need for dvd",1468281600,5,315,3.716417910447761
7736263,5,B01EIW2RMO,"I'm so glad Funimation got the rights to LuckyStar and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya! Both are really great anime series that were extremely popular in Japan and released im the US by Bandai around a decade ago. It's great that LuckyStar is gonna finally be rereleased. For those of you who don't know, Lucky Star is a slice-of-life anime that peeks into the lives of ordinary Japanese High School student girls while referencing many Japanese culture and popular Anime...as quoted by character Akira Kogami herself as she explains this in show to the Anime Store manager ;) It's really one of those ""talking head"" shows where you watch characters have conversations with each other about what's the end of a chocolate cornet. The fat end or the skinny end?

Since we already know Lucky Star is a great series there's no doubt this rerelease will ALSO be great since Funimation is releasing it! We'll expect reversible cover art and hopefully bonus features... unlike Sentai Filmworks' horrible releases. Seriously, have any of you seen how they releases Clannad?? That big, tacky, bulky box with the discs stacked onto each other on a cheap spindle with a foamy sponge to keep it in place? Shaking my head. On top of that they don't offer ANY bonus features on their releases except Textless Opening and Ending Animations and other Sentai Filmworks previews...which is usually only just that series opening... so we don't actually get a trailer. Shaking my head again. So glad Funimation secured this and Haruhi and NOT Sentai Filmworks. I actually had a BAD dream that Sentai Filmworks got Haruhi and REDUBBED IT!

The cast was awful:
Kyon - David Matranga
Haruhi Suzumiya - Brittany Karbowski
Yuki Nagato - Emily Neeves
Mikuru Asahina - Hilary Haag...

I don't even know who do Koizumi's voice ans frankly I don't care. I'm not saying these voice actors are bad...THEY JUST REUSE THEM in every one of their shows! Clannad, Angel Beats and ef...BUT thankfully that was only a dream and Sentai will for sure NOT redub Haruhi.

Lucky Star is one of the English Dubs that I truly love and prefer over the Japanese voices. Wendy Lee is amazing as Konata Izumi and so is Michelle Ruff, Karen Strassman, Kari Wahlgren, Stephanie Sheh and Sam Regal...all personal favorites of mine in the English dubbed world of anime.

I REALLY hope Funimation includes a new English dub for the OVA episode! That'll definitely be a marketable feature and secure my decision to definitely buy this product!",1467072000,,2490,4.877068557919622
7736264,5,B01EIW2RMO,"Lucky * Star is one of my all-time favorite animes, and I'm SUPER THRILLED to see that FUNimatiom is releasing this blu-ray/DVD combo pack! (Even though I already own the whole series on the DVDs released by BANDAI, lol!)

Anyway, this show is great for many laughs and feel-good moments. Its slice-of-life humor really makes it relatable at times, too, even though there are plenty of references to Japanese culture, as well. Every character fits into some sort of anime trope, but with their own unique spins to them, and they're absolutely adorable. HIGHLY recommend for anyone looking for a good light-hearted humor or general moe-type anime.",1466640000,6,646,5.037383177570093
7736265,5,B01EIW2RMO,Finally coming out after so long! Dub is pretty terrible in my opinion but the original is gold.,1465689600,,96,4.388888888888889
7736266,4,B01EIW2RMO,"As much as I love this series, both dubbed and subbed, I just hope the OAV gets the same dub treatment when it gets released.

As a bonus, FUNimation should've added the complete Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku (The Miyakawa Family Hunger) series to the mix.  I just hope FUNi gets to license it in the future.

Since I haven't been keeping up with the latest anime news or re-release/re-licensed news and The Miyakawa Family Hunger was already licensed, then forget what I said.

Overall, the Lucky Star series is great to watch from beginning to end.  The English dub is fantastic, by the way.

EDIT: Looks like the OAV is the same as Bandai's release; subtitled-only release.

Sorry, but I had to give it 4 out of 5 stars just because of it.

7736274,4,B01EIW2RMO,"Lucky Star is one of those shows where you have to be the right target audience to really appreciate its humor. Particularly, it works best if you take to nerdy/geeky humor, and have some familiarity with such culture as typically presented in anime.

That's not to say there are not amusing scenes if you do not fall into the above group though. The show is pretty slim, not much plot to be had, but the characters are memorable and fun for the most part. Even though the plot doesn't really go anywhere, it has a similar feel to it that Azumanga Daioh or Nichijou have in the sense that it takes a look at some mundane everyday things in ways that make them amusing and entertaining.

Personally I still think Azumanga Daioh is the better comedy series overall and for the average viewer, but if you're even just a bit nerdy, or you can appreciate that kind of humor, you'll want to give Lucky Star a try.",1417219200,,907,4.425149700598802

7736285,5,B01EIW2RMO,"This is a brilliant series! I loved every minute of it; I'm only sorry that it ended!

There isn't much of a story to it (that isn't a criticism!); it just follows the day-to-day lives of the characters, who are four high school friends; nutty 'otaku', the diminutive, blue-haired Konata Izumi ('Kona-chan'), who also works part-time in a 'cosplay' cafe; intelligent and cute Kagami Hiiragi ('Kagamin') and her non-identical twin sister, the clumsy but lovely Tsukasa (who both have purple hair), and the pretty and bespectacled Miyuki Takara ('Yuki-chan'), who has pink hair, and is the epitome of 'moe'. The series (which comes from the same people as the 'Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya' stories) contains many and frequent references to other anime and manga (mostly courtesy of Kona-chan, and much to the chagrin of Kagami, who thinks she is crazy!), so I would probably say that non-fans of the genres might find it a little hard to follow; the significance of many lines of the dialogue probably being lost unless the viewer knows what they are talking about.

Each episode starts with a superb series of dance moves by the girls (somewhat reminiscent of the closing animation of the Haruhi Suzumiya series) which you come to find out is actually them rehearsing for the end-of-term festival, in which they perform a cheer-leader routine, seen in full in the last episode of the series, and which is mega-cute and cool!

The 6 DVD's contain all 26 episodes, which have English and Japanese audio, and 1 OVA (with Japanese soundtrack/English subs only).

I gather from digging around on-line, that there won't be any more animes of this story - a great pity - but I would highly recommend any fans of the genre get hold of this; it is a great series, and highly enjoyable; it is gentle and bonkers, and just totally lovable!",1348876800,,1829,4.852564102564102

Like almost all shows adapted by Kyoto Animation, it is written for a very specific audience that is expected to be familiar with the character types and references within the series, and Lucky Star is on the extreme end of even that. This remarkably strange and hilarious ""story"" of high school girls doing nothing much in particular is filled with references to other series and anime and video game subcultures. Don't let the cute animation style and almost entirely female cast fool you; this show is written almost exclusively for a 16-34 year-old male audience, although not the one that most North American audiences think of. The voice acting is superb in both Japanese and English and the animation is fluid, although backgrounds are (intentionally) left devoid of detail.

The packaging is very bare-bones, so you might be better off moving the discs into a DVD folder as soon as you get it, but at this price you aren't paying for extras, and it is an absolutely fantastic deal, like the entire Anime Legends series has been.",1329091200,2,1106,4.790575916230367

Now I'm on disc 2 and I'm already having problems. The picture it shows is a little bit on the blurry side, and when I want to see the trailers, it just goes all weird and doesn't let me watch them. I only gave this 3 stars because I haven't actually had any problems with the lucky star episodes playing, but I'm still pretty ticked off at the quality and the inability to watch the trailers.",1327104000,3,537,4.02803738317757
7736293,5,B01EIW2RMO,"Lucky Star has become something of an anime classic. It's slice of life style is similar to Azumanga Daioh, but without the wacky fantasy sequences. The series is more or less a collection of skits that could be viewed at random, but I'd recommend watching them in order the first time through. While there isn't a strong on-going plot, the main characters' personalities are developed as the series progresses, revealing each one's quirks, strengths, and weaknesses, with additional characters introduced as time goes on.

You get to know these girls the same way you get to know your friends, by seeing them in everyday life, and meeting their siblings, parents and teachers. And most of all you get to know them by watching them doing goofy, silly, mundane, and sometimes touching things. You get to see the tender, vulnerable side of tough, level-headed Kagami when she gets a note from a boy. You learn how Miyuki got to be so smart, and what her greatest fear is. You discover that lazy, air-headed game player Konata can do some very practical things much better than the other girls, and that Tsukasa isn't quite as dumb as she seems. Like real life, the girls tease each other, sympathize with each other, and discuss boys and other things that girls only discuss among themselves.

In the process, you'll also pick up a fair amount of Japanese culture. You'll learn the term 'Christmas Cake' doesn't just apply to a dessert, the Japanese attitude toward anime and otaku, and, of course, the answer to sweet, innocent Yutaka's question: ""What's yaoi?"" (LOL!)

The series gets sentimental near the end, with an episode about how Konata's Mom and Dad met, and episodes about the older girls senior year. It ends with the famous ""let's do something to remember"" project, thought up by one of the most likely characters, and brought together by one of the least likely. Even Kagami would get misty-eyed if she were watching.

By the end of the last disc you will probably feel like you have made 4 or 5 new friends, and that's the charm and the strength of this series. The fact that these characters do come across as people you care about. People you've laughed with and sympathized with, and probably recognized a bit in your friends in the real world. You'll also have one of the most over-the-top theme songs burned into your brain. But that's OK, because it'll just remind you of some old high-school (anime) friends.",1323561600,13,2428,4.787589498806683
7736294,5,B01EIW2RMO,"If anyone wants to know about Japanese anime and curios about high school life, then this one is for everyone to see.  It contains a wide variety of topics and issues that normal teenage girls will talked about between on another.  I recommend this DVD.",1319673600,,253,4.6
7736295,5,B01EIW2RMO,"I really didn't find anything wrong with this purchase. I never watched lucky star until I bought this set, i'm pretty impressed. Like it says, it includes all 6 dvd's and such, at great quality. Lucky star is an anime that I will always cherish, Konata's antics remind me of myself at times haha.

The only minor gripes I had were the dvd packaging, which is a commonplace for these types of purchases. The dvd roms seem to be so securely placed in the package, I was afraid of damaging them upon removal but its not a big issue. Another issue would be the subtitles, large green and obtrusive as they are. I got used to it a couple episodes in, but I have to say that they could have been better produced. The translations were okay, a few times I could point out instances where a better translation could be used.

But in all, I believe this was a 5 star purchase, and I would recommend this to anyone else who takes interest in watching this gem of a show. Thanks!

7736297,4,B01EIW2RMO,"Lucky Star quickly became one of my favorite anime's. So when I saw that I could get all 24 episodes for just $30, I immediately jumped at the deal. When looking at the product online, it seems kind of sketchy because the case is so small, but when you open it, you see the discs are set in a way where the discs overlap. I have no problem with this, but there are possible occurrences that can happen. When I opened the case for, maybe, the third time, the first two discs fell out, and I thought that this may be a malfunction with the case. So i put the discs back in, and re-opened it, and the discs didn't fall out. So i knew that the discs must have been loose from me taking out and putting in the discs. The setup for the discs can be quite difficult at times, but it saves space. The menu sometimes gets a little repetitive with the ""Darlin' Darlin Please"" every time you select an option. Also, if you like watching it in Japanese with the English subtitles, you will have to repeatedly go to the ""Set Up"" menu and select ""Japanese"" for voice, and ""English"" for subtitles. Other than that, this was a great product for many an otaku, and a great price at that.",1313366400,,1170,4.227678571428571

I would also recommend this set highly now that I also possess Blu-Ray release sold in Amazon.co.jp.

I would say that the quality of picture in this thin set is sufficiently good compared with the blu-ray set. The bonus is also plenty.

Nevertheless, I should also add that the anime Lucky Star is also legendary in its ""media mix"". If you are also interested in things like Cast Concert in Budokan, I really highly recommend you to consider an option of purchasing the blu-ray box mentioned above.

7736301,5,B01EIW2RMO,"This series is for all ages. There is something for everyone, guys and girls. After seeing a great many clips online of this anime, I decided to watch a little of season one and instantly ordered this set after I had seen the first three episodes. (this set contains season one and two) This stuff is highly comforting and addictive. Great to watch seriously, or to just throw in and casually view. Considering each episode is a divergence from its last, the way you watch them can be anyway you like. Also great to watch with a friend!
  The general concept is the everyday little things that happen to all of us while around our friends.. the little details that occur in small talk and deep conversations. There is a lot of philosophizing over matters that seem very small, yet the way the characters each  handle this subject matter is so adorable and fun to watch. There are a lot of situations that the team of characters run into independently but mainly together.
  There are four main characters, all 17(?) year old high school girls. Two of the four are the main, main characters, Konata and Kagamin. These two give us a lot of joy to watch because they are constantly at ends with eachother's way of doing things. Konata is the rebellious, cool chick who works at the local cosplay cafe, always skips studying in lieu of watching new episodes of anime being aired, or going by the bookstore to check out/pick up the newest manga. She is a self proclaimed otaku, meaning one who obsesses over video games, anime, manga and the like. Kagamin is her polar opposite. A dedicated, hard working and studying classmate who is a natural leader. These two personality types work quite well together and are best friends in this series. There is Tsukasa who is the fraternal twin of Kagamin, she is an airhead but a cute lovable and interesting girl. Then Miyuki-san. Pink haired, bespectacled girl who is the naturally maternal, super intelligent and insightful friend.
  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how good a series about random subject matter and everyday happenings can truly be. I guess it's mostly in the cuteness of it all and in how well defined and developed all the characters throughout, are. The art work is very precise and crisply drawn, also very colorful and fluid. It is a pleasure to see. Please purchase this box set! It may not be a structurally amazing anime series like Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya or Death Note. It is however, an incredible joy and top of the line viewing material! I guess the genre is called 'slice of life.' :)",1307059200,,2578,4.652747252747253

7736303,5,B01EIW2RMO,"Lucky Star is one of those anime series that is not based on any unique ideas but follows the typical Japanese high school lifestyle. The main characters are four high school girls that do not do anything special but act like normal high school students. The storyline mirrors a comedic reality of high school life in Japan & how the characters interact with other characters on a daily basis. The plot is unusual to follow since life in high school is very variant depending on the high school student's preference of Japanese education. An overall great anime series filled with some random dull moments & comedic scenes, yet exciting to follow the daily lifestyle of a Japanese high school girl.
The voice acting is excellent in portraying the characters personalities. The dialogue is suitable for a typical high school girl conversation.
I highly recommend this anime series to any anime fans of the ""MOE"" genre.

7736304,1,B01EIW2RMO,"I love Lucky Star and I'm glad to see the series finally available for a reasonable price, but this set, like many other anime box sets, falls victim to the problem of cheap packing and poor quality control. The 6 discs are placed in the case in a stacking format, so 2 dvds are positioned on top of each other. This method leaves the discs very loosely fitted in the case, which practically GUARANTEES one or more of your discs will end up loose by the time you get ahold of it, and thus, the discs WILL be scratched and won't work. As a result, my disc 2 was scratched and doesn't play episode 8 at all.

So here's a suggestion. if you buy this in a store, open it when you get to your car and make damn sure none of the discs are loose, and if you order it through amazon, well, then you just will have to accept that you're going to get scratched discs, because UPS deliverymen don't give a damn about the packages they are transporting.

But you know what? This could all be avoided if the company would do the right thing, and spend a few extra dollars to make a box set that is worth the price you pay for. I'm not asking for some limited edition fancy thing, I'm just asking for, you know, the case to do what it's SUPPOSED TO DO : keep the DVDs inside and secure.",1283299200,20,1272,4.125

Lucky Star started on the topic of how to eat a pastry the right way. While I sat watching that I was officially a fan. This is such a great show. While some of the topics may not be towards everyone's liking, it is just a funny show. Each character is unique and funny in their own way and it just keeps the show interesting from beginning to end even though nothing really exciting happens! There are no crazy battles, no heavy emotional stories...none of that. All it is just teenagers being teenagers....with a little stereotypical anime thrown in.

It is still fine for kids, but there is also a lot of adult humor in there too. Things that kids most likely would not pick up on, as it is hidden in there decently.. By looking at the front, you will probably expect that these are kinds in junior high or something. They are not. They are high school girls.

The show revolves around these 4 girls, one which is an otaku, one is a brainiac, one is a klutz, and one with a strong personality. The Otaku girl is always making comments that revolve around her interests ( which she plays adult games, so you can imagine where that goes). She has a father that is a bit of a pervert, but is still fun to watch. and the strong girl is always going back and forth with the otaku girl, which leaves some interesting situations, and comments.

I really do not want to give too much away, but, overall, the show was very good. I had no problem watching it straight though (yes, I have had some that after a few episodes, or a disk, I needed to take a brake from it).. This one kept me entertained where I did not need to take breaks in the middle, and put something else in for a while. It is basically a high school comedy.
