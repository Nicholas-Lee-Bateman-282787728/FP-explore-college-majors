In ""High Heels and Low Lifes,"" bosom buddies Frances (Mary McCormack) and Shannon (Minnie Driver) get wasted in a London nightclub to drown their sorrows and celebrate Shannon's birthday. Despite being as tipsy as tops and being thoroughly incapable of uncorking a bottle, they overhear a dimwitted bank robber providing live commentary as the event happens. Frances writes down his mobile phone number with a steady hand. They miraculously sober up and, upon the cajoling of the conscientious Shannon, they approach the police with the tip. Predictably enough, the police, occupied as they are with ingenuous junkies and riotous revelers, have no time to deal with bank robbers. Frances, an aspiring American actress, who can't even impersonate a tomato from outer space, persuades Shannon to join her in a blackmail caper.

What follows stretches the imagination to breaking point. The dim-witted sidekick, Danny, like all low lifes, is holed out in the East End. His boss, Mason (Kevin McNally), acts like an investment banker and lives in a country mansion. Mason, in turn, is under the tutelage of Kerrigan (Sir Michael Gambon), who would pass for a member of the House of Lords if not for the small matter of a hideous Essex accent! Add to that two bumbling detectives, one more interested in hitting on Shannon (understandably), and you have the perfect formula for cheap thrills. Leave your brains behind and have a good laugh.

Like good Londoners, the girls make their first call from the ubiquitous red phone booth. Like all red London phone booths, this one nearly knocks them out with its stench of stale piss. Frances's attempts at impersonating a tough-talking blackmailer illuminate her failed career as an actress. Curiously, the bad guys are dumber than the audience and mistake her Yankee drawl for the voice of a member of that exclusive club, the British underworld. Until the last 10 minutes of the movie, attempted blackmail only results in the shooting of a bum, and the merciful exit of Danny. Finally, after a lot of contrived rigamarole signifying nothing, the climax shifts to Mason's stately country home for a decisive shoot out. The good guys let loose with canons while the baddies retaliate with peashooters. No prize for guessing who wins.

Blackmail works. McCormack is dreadful as Frances. Driver would give most nurses an inferiority complex. Substitute a tight plot for the girls' tight clothes, and you'll have a whale of a time. Moreover, Shannon can give you a few lessons on how to dump your boyfriend.",1098057600,,2596,5.030232558139535
1306409,4,B00003CY40,"Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack shine in this fast paced British comedy about two friends who get caught up in a
robbery thanks to her unemployed boyfriend, Ray and his electronic
eavesdropping equipment. Enter Shannon,(Driver) a sensible, lovely, nurse in her early 30's who has come home for what she thought was her birthday celebration. Unbeknownst to her, the boyfriend is too involved with his scanners listening in on half of London's phone calls and wants nothing to do with any festivities. A fight ensues and mister not-so-wonderful is tossed out next morning, gadgets and all.
  Shannon calls on her friend Francis (McCormack) a fiesty, 30-ish, voice over actress, for support. Together, they overhear a robbery in progress. Just so happens, the thief's cell phone number is displayed for all to see on the computer. Now that's caller ID LOL. The girls get to talking and decide they want in on the on the multi million pound take.
  The script is frothy and doesn't give you a chance to think about what else you could have rented at the video store. Laughs
abound from beginning to end.
  Be sure to get the DVD version for some extra features well worth the price of rental. Parents, keep in mind, ""High Heels and Low Lifes"" comes with an R rating and lives up to it quite well. Not suggested for kids under 15.
  Enjoy :)",1077235200,5,1337,4.708154506437769
1306410,4,B00003CY40,"Many of the other reviews have criticized this movie for being unrealistic, but cripes, it's a comedy, it's not supposed to be a documentary!  Anyway, this is a great movie for cheering yourself up when you are sick, or watching with your best friend.  This is for all intents and purposes, a buddy movie for girls.  Are any of the Lethal Weapons plausible?  No, but that's what makes them fun.  I thought I'd add my two cents since all the reviews I saw were from guys.  My girlfriends and I laughed our asses off.

1306411,3,B00003CY40,"This is one of the most ""medium"" movies I've seen.  No real controversy (good girls versus bad guys), no nudity (a real missed opportunity there), no comedic bits that are either really funny or really stupid (there's one scene where Minnie tries to hide a gun in her bra, but the metal's so cold she drops it).
  You could watch this with a new date and just relax, talk some, watch some, no pressure.
  Two young women, a nurse and an actress, overhear a robbery in progress and, deciding that their lives could use some new spice (and new money), try to blackmail the crooks into sharing the loot.
  The characters (nurse-actress-bad guys) are all easily recognized ""types,"" the setting is England but doesn't really have to be (except it's kind of funny listening to the American ""actress"" do her British accent).
  Keep your expectations low, and this movie is fine.",1055635200,2,871,4.71523178807947
1306412,4,B00003CY40,"Two attractive, slightly daffy women overhear a phone call about a heist and decide (unwisely) to blackmail the perpetrators. The story isn't even remotely plausible, but if you're willing to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride, there are some funny bits along the way. If you enjoyed movies like Swordfish, Snatch, True Romance and Nurse Betty you'll probably like this one too.",1049673600,2,387,5.0625
1306413,3,B00003CY40,"Very light-hearted caper comedy of which quality is enhansed by enchanting two leading ladies, ""High Heels and Low Lifes"" is perfectly made for Minnie Driver and Mary MaCormack.  Even though the film met a commercial and critical failure, and it certainly deserves partly its not so good reputauion, the film is fairly agreeable largely owing to these ladies.
The story is admittedly silly and implausible.  Driver (hard-working nurse) and McCormack (unemployed actress) accidentally overhear the conversations of bank robbers, and get the number of one of the gangsters' cell phone (!). The girls, being so unhappy with love and job, decide to blackmail those gangsters to get some money for the hospital, first making an uninvited phone call to unlucky Danny (Danny Dyer, ""Human Traffic"").  Danny, not so clever as to tell every detail of robbery over cell phone, handles the case on his own, trying to hush up those unwelcome guests, and thus making things more complicated.
With many twists in the plot, the film attempts to entertain us, but what it succedds most is not that part, because for many of us, the film looks made by the number, reminding us of many similar situations we have seen before, including ""Life Less Ordinary"" and any Guy Ritchie films.
It is clear that the director Mel Smith is not suitable for the job if you just remember his works in the past -- ""Bean: the Movie"" and ""Tall Guy"" both comedy without crimes, and I must say, not particularly an original one as comedy either.  The former one is helped by the presence of Rowan Atkinson, and the latter by the script of Richard ""Four Weddings"" Curtis and Emma Thompson (it washer film debut).  And ""High Heels,"" made by family-oriented Touchstone Pictures, seems often trying not to offend us, showing its tame version of violence.  In short, as a caper comedy, it lacks energy, being too luckwarm.

However, those leading ladies save the entire work from forgettableness, though not completely.  The acting of them is both very good, making us smile with their down-to-earth characters.  Special mention goes also to their fashionable costume designs, which are always colorful and fantastic.
One of the better roles for Minnie Driver, ""High Heels and Low Lifes"" will amuse her fans, making them confiedent again in her talent and career, which seem a bit declining with misfires like ""Slow Burn"" and ""Beautiful.""  This one is flawed, but much better.",1029888000,,2432,4.967980295566503
1306414,4,B00003CY40,"A lot of movies are made that have little significance or substance, but are ""just for fun,"" and wind up being forgettable, in general, as they are made with an eye on box office or projected video receipts, rather than on creating a film that is not only just for fun, but at the same time, worthwhile and enduring.  Happily, ""High Heels and Low Lifes,"" directed by Mel Smith, is one of those rare gems of a little, just-for-fun movie that succeeds in being exactly what it was meant to be:  Highly entertaining, and most importantly, fun-- and in a way that's not only memorable, but quite accessible and one that lends itself to multiple viewings, primarily because of it's stars, Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack, who make one of the most winsome and engaging teams to come along in quite some time.
After a fight with her boyfriend, nurse Shannon (Driver) is left to celebrate her birthday with her best friend, Frances (McCormack), an aspiring actress.  Departing as he did in a hurry, Shannon's boyfriend leaves behind his recording equipment and the scanners that enable him to pick up telephone conversations he can record and use to create a kind of urban, new age music.  And after a bit too much to drink, the girls start to fool around with the scanner, and happen across a phone conversation between a gang of crooks committing a robbery.
Driven to action by purely altruistic intentions (of course), the girls realize this is a chance to pick up a big chunk of change real quick, and they decide to contact and ""negotiate"" with the thieves for a part of the take.  The girls tell them to cough up or they'll go to the police.  Big mistake, as they have no idea who they're dealing with, or how big (and bad) the organization behind them really is.  But Shannon and Frances are about to find out, and before it's all over, they just may wish they'd never heard of a ""scanner,"" or for that matter, a telephone.  Then again, maybe not...
Mel Smith succeeds in crafting and delivering a high-energy, often hilarious romp through London and the surrounding environs, as he puts his stars through their paces in a way that generates plenty of laughs and makes his audience glad they came along for the ride.  Smith sets a perfect pace that makes this a lively comedy, enriched by witty dialogue, wry British humor and the iridescent performances of Driver and McCormack, all of which makes this film more reminiscent of such fare as Michael Caine's ""The Italian Job,"" or any of the early Peter Sellers movies, rather than the more contemporary Farrelly Brothers/""American Pie"" type humor that is so prevalent today.  And, as such, it is refreshingly fun AND funny, and leaves you yearning for more of the same.
Since her auspicious motion picture debut as Benny in the heartwarming ""Circle of Friends"" in 1995, Driver has successfully filled her resume with films that run the gamut from black comedy (As Debi, ""Grosse Pointe Blank"") and straight drama (Rosie, ""The Governess"") to action (Karen, ""Hard Rain"").  Not all of her projects have been a success critically and/or at the box office, perhaps, but one would be hard-put to find a single performance of hers among them that is not engaging and credible.  She's demonstrated time and again that she can hold her own with the big boys in the high profile films (alongside De Niro in ""Sleepers,"" Damon and Affleck in ""Good Will Hunting""), and one of her most memorable performances is in what is arguably one of the best romantic comedies of all time, ""Return To Me,"" in which she plays Grace.  All in all, in a comparatively short time, Driver has accrued some impressive credentials, and she never fails to live up to her promise-- and her portrayal of Shannon in this film is no exception.  Using to great effect her quirky good looks and winning personality, combined with a discernible intelligence that points up a beauty that is much more than skin deep, here as always, she is a delight to watch.
Perfectly cast, as well, is Mary McCormack, as she succeeds in capturing the very essence of Frances, while proving to be a perfect complement to Driver's Shannon.  McCormack has that same kind of well-rounded beauty as Driver, which indicates there's always something going on behind the eyes, and cinematically speaking, as a team it makes them a force to be reckoned with.  Most importantly, McCormack brings Frances vividly and enthusiastically to life, and it goes far toward enabling the viewer to suspend disbelief long enough to just go with the flow and enjoy the high jinks of these two young ladies as they cut their swath across the English countryside.
In a terrific supporting role, Michael Gambon, as Kerrigan, is wonderfully droll, espousing that oh-so-wry-and-dry British humor in a manner reminiscent and worthy of Noel Coward at his best.  Indeed, Gambon has some of the funniest lines, delivered so subtly as to evoke purely spontaneous bursts of side-splitting laughter from the audience.  And when an actor can do that, he has without question succeeded in doing his job; which is exactly what Gambon has accomplished here.
The supporting cast includes Kevin McNally (Mason), Mark Williams (Tremaine), Danny Dyer (Danny), Darren Boyd (Ray), Simon Scardifield (Tony) and Len Collin (Barry).  By definition, a comedy is a ""movie (or play) of light and humorous character with a happy or cheerful ending.""  Therefore-- by definition-- ""High Heels and Low Lifes"" is a ""comedy"" in every sense of the word.  Thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable, it's a film that makes a promise for a good time to be had by all, then goes on to fulfill that promise.  The magic is alive and well in this one, and that's the magic of the movies.",1026345600,5,5712,4.795315682281059

It is there for entertainment purposes only (not to give you a lesson on life which too many films do these days) and it was a truly funny film from start to finish.

1306779,5,B00003CY40,"Speed is one of the secrets of effective comedy, and especially, I think, of an effective comedy thriller.  Thanks to excellent direction (Mel Smith), High Heels and Low Lifes triumphantly carries us at breakneck pace through its preposterous and delightful story.  An out-of-work American actress (Mary McCormack) and a British nurse (Minnie Driver) accidentally overhear a bank robbery taking place.  They decide to blackmail the robbers for a large slice of the proceeds in return for not going to the police.  Others certainly play their part in making the story work.  The police, distracted and for most of the time two steps behind everyone else, are yet not bumbling incompetents, but believably could solve a crime if ever they had a bit of luck (and if one of them in particular could get his mind off property values).  The villains are credibly effective and dangerous - so that when the girls decide on their venture, one really does want to say to them, ""Please!  This is not a good idea!""  The result is that there is some dramatic tension as well as comedy.  But it is, of course, the comedy between McCormack and Driver that carries the movie as a whole.  The electricity between them is terrific, and their scenes together positively sparkle with wit and energy.  My favorite moments were late in the movie when Minnie Driver, the virtuous hospital nurse, in confrontation with the main villain becomes a positive she-devil in a red dress, obviously enjoying every minute of it.  But there are lots of other good moments, too.
We watched High Heels and Low Lifes after our Thanksgiving Dinner, and it was perfect for our mood.  I think perhaps I shall watch it again after Christmas Dinner.  It is ideal holiday fare.  I have no hesitation in giving it five stars.",1291334400,,1782,4.815789473684211

The lovely Mary McCormack steals the show as the nurse who has ""had enough"" the with rude & nasty bank robbers.  Physically she is stunning, and she has a wonderful screen presence.  I now want to see more movies that she's done after seeing this one!

A word of caution about this film.  While most of it is fun & games, there are a few dark moments in the movie.  The film can best be surprised as a black comedy.  This might be prudent to consider if you're looking for a movie that is 100% good fun.

One other detail is that the movie takes place in Britain.  It's fun to hear the British accents as they jamber on about the mysterious bank robbery.  All in all, a very good farce!!",1143849600,,1003,4.351351351351352
1306784,3,B00003CY40,"It is not often that I use this word in film reviews, but High Heels and Low Lifes was a very cute movie.  While it did follow a very formulaic caper approach, there were elements that were very original and stood out in this film.  It had a crisp semi-humorous story coupled with two actresses that were very into their roles.  There were some dark elements that I was not expecting when they were dealing with the gangsters that kept my attention until the very end.  This was one of those films where you knew exactly how it was going to end, but you still had fun watching your characters get there.  This film was a no-brainer, but in a good sense.  If you are looking for a fun, caper film that takes no energy to watch than this is the film for you.  That is exactly what I was looking for when I watched this film, and it worked perfectly.  Let me tell you why.

My biggest satisfaction from this film came from the very unrealistic portrayal of London's dark underbelly.  It begins with a very sinister retrospect on the crime in this populated city with images of hardcore robbers doing what they do best.  That is the last glimpse we have of that world because by the end of the film the darkness sheds to light and we are handed a fantasy world all our own.  The bad guys go from their darkened world and into mansions full of color, ambition, and cartoon blunders.  It is this sense of unreality that kept me focused on this film.  Here we have two women that are having this ""movie"" adventure while hiding in bushes, wearing dark sunglasses, and fighting with guys in the cow pastures, yet on the other hand we have these criminals that truly want to kill them.  There are huge guns fired, people get shot, and there are even some literal explosions.  It reminded me of when Elmer Fudd was hunting for Bugs Bunny.  There is some horror to the realization that Fudd only wants to ""kill the rabbit"", but there is humor in the unrealistic events that occur due to Bugs' outlandish style and Fudd's ignorance.  So, when you look at the cover of this film, do not be fooled.  What I am trying to say here is that the unreal story is what kept my attention.  I don't know if the writers wanted to create a real world with these heroes, but in my eyes they didn't.  This was a fictional story, and I couldn't see this happening in real life ... and that worked for me.

I must say that Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack are not at the top of Hollywood players list, but they seemed to carry themselves well in this picture.  I think the reason that they worked was because it was a small film.  Driver and McCormack do better in these small budgeted films than they do in the blockbusters.  I don't think I have ever seen a big-budget Minnie Driver film that I would say was ""amazing"", and the same goes for McCormack.  High Heels and Low Lifes is their type of film.  Thankfully, director Mel Smith knows that and knew what he had to work with.  He keeps the tone low on this film, making the humor not laugh-out-loud, but grinable.  There wasn't really anything spectacular about the direction of this film, and that was perfect for this film.  At times directors of these smaller films try to reach out and become to artsy with their craft, this was not the case here.  Smith stayed on the path of this film and worked his magic with the greatest of ease.  He was not trying to go over the top, but yet successfully kept this film from sinking.

Overall, this was a ""cute"" film.  I will use that word again because I cannot think of a better way to describe this simple film.  It was easy on the eyes and on the mind, and if you are in the mood for that style of film than High Heel and Low Lifes will provide it.  Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack play off each other exceptionally well while Mel Smith eases behind the camera.  There is nothing spectacular about this film.  I probably will never see it again, but it was worth watching once.  It is always good to have these types of films around.  Those that do not try to go overboard, yet give you exactly what you went in looking for.  I was impressed.
