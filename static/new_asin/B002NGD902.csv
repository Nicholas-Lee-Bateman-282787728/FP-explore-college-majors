3959235,5,B002NGD902,"Andre Rieu as his best again.  If you love Andre and his Orchestra, you will love this too.  He's the best as always.",1259625600,5,117,4.043478260869565
3959236,5,B002NGD902,"I have several of the Andre Rieu DVDs and enjoyed them all. However, ""Live in Dresden: The Wedding at the Opera, I thought was wonderful. What a great idea, a wedding party at the concert.",1259539200,9,188,4.4
3959237,5,B002NGD902,"After seeing Andr Rieu's ""Live in Vienna"" and thinking ""it doesn't get any better than this, the World Music King pulls another one out of his hat! .  It was not just excellent music - it was excellent entertainment - especially  in the ""Figaro"" aria, where, by weaving in the  comical ""barber chair"" segment, he turned what for some ""modernists"" was too ""dated"" a piece into an entertainment delight.  Besides the orchestra doing their usual excellent job, the singers - both male and female - were superb, with the Platin Tenors's rendition of ""E Lucevan le Stelle"" perhaps the best that I have ever heard.

The whole program flowed seamlessly from start to finish, with the two themes (marriage and opera) combined cleverly and tastefully throughout the show; and nothing could have been a better backdrop for such than Dresden's beautiful Semperoperhaus.  The mix of tunes, the costumery, and Andr's witty commentary made for a perfect blend; there wasn't a tedious moment in the whole program.  I would recommend this DVD for not just for ""Andr-philes"" but for ANYONE.",1259539200,33,1073,4.960893854748603
3959238,5,B002NGD902,I always have Rieu's new releases pre ordered at amazon so the arrive as soon as they are available. his new one is fantastic - a real video dream from the opulent opera house in Dresden. He's not called the 'Waltz King' for nothing!,1257379200,16,233,4.318181818181818
3959239,4,B002NGD902,"This offering from Ande Rieu's burgeoning oeuve lives up to high standards he sets in bringing classical music to a general public. The availability and reasonably priced videos alternatives make them welcome additions to one's library of DVD keepsakes. 'Live in Dresdan::The Wedding at the Opera"" is a welcome addition.
Andre, keep up your tradition of offering great music,singers and musicians to people of all backgrounds - performances which make the viewing audiences,whether live or on on recordings, feel very much involved in the fun, excitement and mood-changing program. Oh, to sing with his Strauss Orchestra !

3959255,5,B002NGD902,"As with everything Andre' Rieu dreams up, one will never be disappointed. You never know who, what, or how many will be part of his concert. Some of the music you may have heard on other CD/DVD's, but it is always presented in such a fashion as to sound new to you, and the number of ways it is presented never gets old. He truly is a gift to all people of the world and never fails to touch the heart, soul, spirit and emotions of his audience. Very highly recommended",1396310400,2,469,4.164835164835165
3959256,5,B002NGD902,You can never go wrong on any of Andre Rieu DVD'S. When you want to escape the real world this puts you into a dream world. Nothing like an evening with Andre Rieu.,1390348800,,164,4.0

3959258,5,B002NGD902,"Another excellent D.V.D.from Andre Rieu,especially when the newly-married couple entered the Dresden Opera House,Andre Rieu fans will love it,as I did!",1376870400,2,151,6.238095238095238
3959259,5,B002NGD902,"I already had this concert on DVD which I recorded off of my local PBS station.  However, it was interrupted by extensive ""Pledge breaks"" to raise money for the station.  I ordered this DVD because I wanted a more pristine copy.  Andre combines beautiful music, lavish dancing, some comedy (the Barber of Seville cutting the groom's hair), and as with all of his concerts, has the audience standing, waving their arms to the music, and dancing in the aisles.  The Dresden Opera House is the perfect setting for this concert.",1376265600,4,524,4.788888888888889
3959260,2,B002NGD902,"The DVD stopped at times and finally started again. I cleaned it several times ,but no improvemen
The  music is excellent.",1369526400,,122,4.809523809523809
3959261,5,B002NGD902,"Anything Andre Rieu records on DVDis fine with me.  We have everything he does, and play them over and over again.  Can't beat that for good, fun, wholesome entertainment. The Radio City Music Hall catered to the Italian audience, but there are lots of Irish immagrants there, as well as other nationalities....but Italian music is good once in a while, just like Italian food......but Chinese or Irish food works for us too......How many more times will I enjoy Finiculi Finicula........the Frank Sinatra tribute was great...........The Dresden Wedding was fabuoous....Platin Singers always good - and the Hungarian Food episode was cute.  Thank You, Andre, for all you give us.",1367798400,2,679,5.268518518518518
3959262,5,B002NGD902,"Spectacular show, great music, singing, and dance.  Just like being in Dresden. Great to share with fans of classical music.",1357516800,,124,5.2
3959263,5,B002NGD902,Received on time and love the DVD. We also ordered a few other tapes all were received and we are enjoying the music.,1356220800,,117,4.130434782608695
3959264,5,B002NGD902,Enjoyed every minute!!  We will watch this many times through the coming years! Have watched it a couple of times with different guests and they have all loved it!,1356048000,,163,4.620689655172414
3959265,5,B002NGD902,"To me, this was one of Andre's best concerts. Great mixture of popular songs and operatic arias.  The vocalists were outstanding, and the orchestra is well deserving of the many accolades it receives. Not matter what is on your mind, or what is putting you into a ""funk"", listen to and watch the Johann Strauss Orchestra, with Andre Rieu conducting, and I guarantee, they will cause you to forget your troubles.  One other thing of importance to me, personally:  I was in the Pacific Theater during WWII, but I kept up with activities of the European Theater, and I remember, vividly, what happened to Dresden.  Having said that, then to see such a magnificent building as the Semperoperhaus, I just watched and cried, both for past damage, and German ingenuity, which brought this opera house out of the ashes. You will love ""Live in Dresden.""",1353110400,4,844,4.8
3959266,5,B002NGD902,If you love classical music this is a very fun CD to listen to and even more fun to watch on DVD. I love his music and Strauss if my favorite composer,1333238400,,150,3.71875
3959267,5,B002NGD902,"This is the 6th Andre Rieu DVD I have given to my 94 year old young Mother, she sits for hours watching her DVD's remenissing and singing away, and enjoying herself 5* for artists 5* for Seller, 5* for postage and packing, and speedy delivery",1316131200,2,242,4.4
3959268,5,B002NGD902,The scenery and the music are both wonderful.  What a beautiful setting for a concert and I'll bet the newlyweds will always remember their wedding day.  The concert included some of Andre's usual song picks and the Barber of Seville piece was musical humor at its best.,1289520000,5,270,4.723404255319149
3959269,5,B002NGD902,The show was excellent and the musicians were fabulous with their performances.  The three tenors sang beautifully and will give you goose bumps listening to them.  The female singers were excellent and it was just a pleasure listening to them.  Andrea Rieu did an excellent job as always directing his orchester.  The DVD is definitely an asset to your library. It's a five star rating.,1282348800,3,387,4.907692307692308
3959270,5,B002NGD902,"Live in Dresden will become one of my favorites.  It combines the artistry of Andre Rieu and his orchestra with the music that has stood the test of time.  While being sophisticated it contains humor and a lightheartedness that only he can master.  I used to hate the funeralistic classical music but,now that I constantly play his
cds or dvds, and watch him in action, I am completely mesmerized.  Keep  it up Rieu and thank you.",1274832000,7,430,4.605263157894737
3959271,5,B002NGD902,"I love this concert.  The music selection, singers, dancers are all amazing.
This beautiful setting is perfect for the wedding gala.  Very festive selection of music and romantic too. The DVD has exceptional video and audio quality.
Well done!",1267488000,13,243,5.205128205128205
3959272,4,B002NGD902,"I have most of Andre's DVD's. The show is excellent, however the image quality is not up to the highest standards that were used on the ""Homecoming"" show.",1265760000,2,154,4.535714285714286
3959273,5,B002NGD902,I enjoyed every minute of it. It was actually a gift for my grand mom she loved it.,1265500800,2,83,3.6666666666666665
3959274,5,B002NGD902,"Outstanding musical program - top talent, great presentation, musical selections and costumes.  If I had not known his work, what would I have wanted to know?  ""This is semi-classical, great JOYOUS, spirited, ochestral entertainment plus a few world -favorite operatic solos by outstanding singers.""  fOR LOVERS OF WONDERFUL, HAPPY MUSIC.

Rieu's past programs/tapes preceed him - each seems bettter than the next, except for the one in NY - did not enjoy that AT ALL",1265414400,3,467,5.1866666666666665
3959275,4,B002NGD902,"Excellent DVD - Very entertaining. I purchased 2 one for a gift.

3959276,5,B002NGD902,"Wonderful location,wonderful orchestra, singers and guests.  Rieu does not disappoint in this latest production with his trademark warmth, humour and musicality from the whole ensemble.",1264982400,3,185,6.4
3959277,5,B002NGD902,"This is a specacular video and we used it to entertain ourselves as well as house guests during the holiday.  Everyone loved it.  The music is wonderful, the color and Andre Rieu is outstanding, as always.",1264809600,3,205,4.666666666666667
3959278,4,B002NGD902,"I love Andre Rieu, and have seen most of his videos.  This performance in Dresden is special for a few reasons.  I used to live in Germany, and it was great to see the highlights of Dresden again, and see all the German people in the audience.  The costumes are beautiful.  He has a nice group of young dancers on the flanks of the stage for many of the performances, dancing the viennese waltz.  There is also a newlywed couple involved in many of the numbers.  And Andre speaks throughout in German, entertaining the audience with subtle humor.  Some of that might be lost on those who don't know German, but the subtitles are fine.
In a word: Elegant.  Probably the most elegant of all of his videos.  I really loved the singalongs at the end of the program.",1264636800,5,761,4.41726618705036
3959279,5,B002NGD902,"Andre Rieu is fantastic in his music, presentation and showmanship.  A delight for every age.",1264032000,3,93,5.2
3959280,4,B002NGD902,"This was somewhat of a disappointment. The Music is fine but all other Andre Rieu DVDs
concentrate on the music, Andre, the singers and the orchestra. This seems to be concentrated on audience shots and Andre,and the music. The members of the Orchestra and Choir seem as an afterthought.  Of the newer DVDs by Andre Rieu, the Live in Australia is far better than this on.",1262131200,2,371,4.621212121212121
3959281,5,B002NGD902,"Andre Rieu's , 'Live in Dresden', is another superb DVD and well worth buying.

3959282,4,B002NGD902,"I give this DVD a 9 as I feel the Australia DVD is still the best out of all the Andre Rieu presentations. If Carla M. had at least one song on the DVD I would have given the program a 10. Still, the program is a welcomed addition to any musical collection.",1261180800,2,257,3.8679245283018866
3959283,5,B002NGD902,"This is an excellant production in every way,wonderful music as usual and delightful repartee by Andre Rieu. We thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and will watch it time and time again.",1260403200,7,178,4.966666666666667
3959284,5,B002NGD902,"This generation is so fortunate to have music played so well in technique, style, passion, and arrangements.  I do not know how anyone could not enjoy this music by Andre Rieu, his orchestra, choir, and soloists.  Andre has a way of combining the universal and the local. These musicians enjoy wht they do and show it, causing us to want to enjoy it as well.  I do not know of any better true showman in the world than Andre Rieu.  If you haven't heard Andre's music, try it.  You will have only one regret:  you didn't try it sooner.",1260144000,8,534,4.343434343434343
3959285,5,B002NGD902,"With all the trash on TV, this was a deeply satisfying DVD to watch instead !! Still got a good dose of classical music, besides hearing the ""wedding march"" in full.",1260057600,9,165,4.354838709677419
3959286,1,B002NGD902,"Nice production values, and if you're a fan of schmaltz-y, hammed-up classical, then I'm sure you'd love this. If you're a fan of classical music, skip it and get something by one of the great symphonies, like the LSO, BSO, CSO, etc.",1259971200,9,233,4.571428571428571
3959287,5,B002NGD902,"I purchased this DVD when it was on pre-order, and it shipped out the very next day after it was released. I received it on time and it was a gift for my mom since she is a huge Andre Rieu fan. She thought by far, out of all his previous releases this was the best.

Amazon is always reliable and on time :-) I will definitely be ordering more releases in the future.",1259884800,3,367,3.9594594594594597
3959288,5,B002NGD902,"This is another great performance for Andre and his orchestra.
