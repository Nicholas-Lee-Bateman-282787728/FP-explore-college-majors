1918238,2,B0000CC885,"The first hour or so of this film is truly amazing !!. seriously.
You find yourself baffled and looking for what is causing these suicides. There is a web page that updates everytime someone is killed....these circles representing each death vibrate....are they hipnostising  the victim to kill themselves???? everytime this pop song plays on the tv or radio, someone seems to commit suicide...who knows what's going on. Twenty minutes before the end we see the main character unable to accept his loss in his family, commit suicide himself!!! wow!!! then we see an over the top character claiming to be a modern age manson. How is he responsible for the suicides?? is he responsible??? apparently there are undertones here warning us about pop culture and a girl in the film cracks some kind of code, revealing the relationship between the pop group and the deaths.
What follows does not make any sense at all.
Personally, to me, even though other reviewers out there are saying there are many hidden messages here, it feels like the director came to a point in the film where he wasn't sure what to blame the suicides on and threw in an abrupt inexplicable ending.
It is a real shame. What start off as an awsome thrilling film (up there with RING,DARK WATER and AUDITION) becomes a serious let down.
I love david lynch, Polish bros etc etc. I love puzzles!! but here I feel like I have been  cheated out of any explanation whatsoever!",1074988800,7,1437,4.744
1918239,2,B0000CC885,"It's one of those movies that annoys one royally, not because it's ineptly made, but because it's well-made but squanders a lot of potential.
The opening scenes are remarkable and memorable.  Fifty-four girls go to a train platform, laughing and joking, and as a train approaches, almost playfully take hands and jump under the train's wheels, where they're all killed in some amazingly explicit footage.
The suspense is mounting...what is causing the wave of suicides among Japan's youth?  What is the meaning of the strips of skin taken from each corpse, found in a bag at each crime scene, sewn together in a grisly chain?  What is the meaning of the website that logs the suicides as they happen, before they're reported or even discovered?
Unfortunately, the story is largely unresolved at the end.  After getting off to such a great and intriguing start, it seems as if the writers and directors had no idea of where to take the story or how to end it.  Plot elements are dropped.  Important characters disappear halfway through.  Insignificant characters suddenly take center stage.  Time is wasted on red-herring subplots.  The conclusion is a garbled mess that will leave the viewer scratching his head.  The film comes to a stop rather than a satisfactory end.
It's too bad, because the first half is so good and haunting.  It's frustrating to see it veer off into surreal, pretentious nonsense.
There's a great story here, waiting for a cohesive ending.  With the wave of Asian-horror remakes on the way from Hollywood (DARK WATER, THE GRUDGE, etc), I almost hope some producer will take the first half of this movie and make a more comprehensible ending for it.",1074470400,7,1673,4.8936170212765955
1918240,1,B0000CC885,"well, at first sign it seems a very interesting movie. The story stars good, the gore is good even the actors are good. But there are a lot of problems, first of all the ending is too obvious, you can figure out really fast. Then the gore scenes are ridiculous, i mean how can a person cut off their fingers without make any expression and there is another scene when a girl is falling from the ceiling and the body explodes like a blood bomb!, those moments are very stupid that doesn't shock you that makes you laugh.
Just before the end, the movie turns somehow into a musical, the good story turns senseless, stupid, obvious. i really don't recommend to buy this movie but is worth see it, at least you learn something about japanese cuulture.",1073952000,7,747,4.45985401459854
1918241,5,B0000CC885,"Perfect on every level, I can honestly say this is the best movie i have seen to date. Alot of reviewers who gave this movies negative reviews simply didn't understand the movie given it is deeply rooted in Japanese culture and psyche, and for the violence. But i feel that the violence and gore work for the film, and the story.. If you are able to get past all that, then you will find a great story you will like.
I have heard that this movie is the first of a trilogy that has not yet been finished, so i will definitely be looking out for that...",1073001600,2,551,4.158878504672897
1918242,4,B0000CC885,"I was extreamly let down by this movie toward the end.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  The movie opens (as i'll bet you've read by now) with 54 smiling school girls throwing themselves in the way of an express train.  At the scene, appeares a bowling bag.  Upon discovery, the guy who ends up being the most main character (there are a few) finds in the bag, a very long roll of stitched-together human skin. Following this are several bone chilling scenes, including on atop a schoolhouse.
This is the basic outline of ""Suicide Club"".  Sounds great, doesn't it?  Well, i tought so, what with it also being refered to as a social commentery.  And it really is good, except toward the end.  There's actually a villian.  WHY!?!?!  It seems like the ""social commentary"" they were going for was thrown on hold because they wanted to see what it would look like if someone looked like a cross between Dr. Frank-n-Furter from ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and Emma Peel from ""The Avengers"".  Curious?  Well, you can SEE the guy in the end of this movie, in a scene (fortunately not THE end)the just resorts to cheap thrills.
If you see this movie, do your very best to ignore it once ""the bat"" is kidnapped, and pay attention again once you see the girl who was landed on by her boyfriend.  She does some quality sleauthing.  Anywho, i though it was a worthwile rental.",1072915200,,1364,4.536885245901639
1918243,5,B0000CC885,the other 5 star reviewers said it perfectly this movie it worth your time.  It will amaze you.,1072828800,,95,4.277777777777778
1918244,5,B0000CC885,"With the begining of the film showing us the gruesome act of 54 joyous high-school girls jumping into the path of an on-coming train, ""Suicide Club"" is one of the most graphic and intensely bizarre films in any type of film.  Here is a movie, the prime example of self re-examination, that will leave you in a twisted state of mind that you may or may not be able to comprehend.  I found myself at the end of the movie, questioning my own beliefs and morals.  ""Do i actually have that connection w/ myself?""  ""Do i know myself as much as i believe?""  ""If i were to die, would my self-sacrafice make me closer to the people around me?""  ""Does my life matter?""  It terrified me that a movie, of all things, could do this kind of thing to a person.
I also believe it to be a movie with multiple meanings.  There is no possible way that every person who sees this will come up with the same meanings at the end.  I found it to be giving a warning: Do not let pop culture and peer pressure influence your morality, common sense, pride and courage.  You have the ability to say no or break free from the expectations of society and all their proverbial boxes.

Do not expect to see a movie of camera turn-aways when a person(s) dies, it shows all the blood, no censorship.  And let me tell you, i was very happy to see such disgusting and disturbing images on my big-screen t.v.
""Suicide Club"" is a great buy, even if you have not seen it before.  I bought this movie w/out seeing it, and i was amazed.  But it is definitely a movie you won't be able to watch day after day.  You might have to wait a few days to watch it again because it will keep you thinking and keep you very, very disturbed.  I know, i have only watched it once and still can't bring myself to watch it again yet...its been three days.  Highly Reccomended for gore-fans, intellects, thinkers, philosephers and so on.",1070150400,5,1882,4.286118980169972
1918245,3,B0000CC885,"Beneath the surface, Suicide Club is more than just another stylized blood bath.  The director Sion Sono's vision of a bleak satire/commentary on the state of modern Japanese culture is apparent throughout the film.  However, the underlying themes are so poorly executed and unstructured that they are eventually lost among the bits and pieces of plot/characters/limbs scattered throughout the film.
As far as gore and shock value goes, Suicide Club won't disappoint fans of Audition or Battle Royale.  The first 5 minutes of the movie inside Sinjuku station set a reverberating macabre tone throughout the movie with promises of wall-covering blood, strewn limbs and human-skin rolls (wink wink) to come.  Director Sion Sono (also a noted gay porn director and experimental poet) does an excellent job creating and maintaining the creepy and sinister undercurrent throughout the movie.  The problem is, the undercurrent simmers and simmers but never boils.  The plot is at best non-linear and mostly illogical, peppered with characters with unclear motives, an out-of-nowhere Rocky Horror-esque musical number, and existential soliloquies that fans of Neo Genesis Evangelion would instantly identify.  There are plenty of impressive moments throughout Suicide Club, but it is unclear whether they serve to enhance or befuddle the main mystery of the suicides.
It's really a shame because Suicide Club is really a social commentary with underlying themes that cut deep into the Japanese psyche.  The suicides baffle police detectives partially because the truth is hidden somewhere in bubble gum pop music, internet message boards and instant messaging, phenomena on the other side of the generation gap.  The suicidal slogan ""To connect yourself to yourself"" while trite to us Americans post-teens, is nevertheless an important commentary on the Japanese society that is historically obsessed with community and nationalism at the cost of individual liberty and identity.  Perhaps the real horror of Suicide Club is that the premise of the movie, in the eyes of all the over-studied students, over-worked salaryman, and over-disconnected families of Japan, is not really that far fetched.
Unfortunately, all its earnest intentions at social satire are mostly drowned in the blood of Suicide Club.",1069718400,15,2297,5.5
1918246,5,B0000CC885,"How to describe ""Suicide Club""? To be honest that's not an easy thing to do, I've never seen anything like it before or since. It is one part forboding Social commentary and one part biting black comedy.
It is in a way a horror movie (but not in the traditinal sence like ""the Ring"")
Now keep in mind that this is also a Japanese art film, and when Japanese films get artsy they tend to get existentialist, and when that happens the awnsers are not forthcoming. I belive that the movie wants you to turn to yourself to find your own awners.
Good movie, but be forewarned, this is not for the faint of heart",1068940800,,606,4.278260869565218
1918247,5,B0000CC885,"The first thing to understand about ""Suicide Club"" is that its not a thriller nor is it a horror-gore film its intention was to bring out in the open a troubling trend that was taking place in Japan among the young. To first put this film in context the WHO reported that in Japan, 29,442 people committed suicide in 2012  20,888 men and 8,554 women  which translates into an age-adjusted rate of 18.5 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants, about 60 percent higher than the global average of 11.4. Suicide packs formed by groups of young people over the internet or through school were seen in Japan but it wasn't openly talked about in the media until this film forced the discussion. The films gore is not intended to shock and isn't unusual in Japanese films but was does shock and fill one with horror is the apparent absurdity of the suicides themselves. Sono is very precise in revealing how almost whimsically group suicides can form and succeed as if a trend more than an actual outcome of personal suffering. I am not suggesting Sono doesn't believe in the traditional suicide of the depressed person taking their own lives but that there is something banal about an online community of strangers or a club coming together for the only purpose of dying together. Its important to note that after the film there was open media discussion about these kinds of suicides and that the rate of suicides in Japan has somewhat fallen over the past few years. This film is well acted, extreme in its depiction of self-destruction and I think that is a smart move. Sono doesn't spare the viewer the ugliness, he doesn't move the camera away but forces the viewer to acknowledge the horror of the act. Very powerful. This is poignant film that doesn't attempts to cynically capitalize on these types of events but rather forces his audiences to acknowledge them.

There is an award winning prequel to this film called Noriko's Dinner Table that companions this film so if you find this film interesting make sure to catch the prequel.",1451952000,3,2027,4.736543909348442

1918249,1,B0000CC885,"I watched this because I was in the mood for a horror movie and the write-up on the back made it seem interesting. 54 school kids jump in front of a train. Was it a ""suicide club""? And if so, what terrible force could have created such a thing? To make the mystery even deeper, there is a mysterious website which anticipates to the very number, each suicide. Sounds like the recipe for a good mystery, does it not?  Well, after watching the entirety of the movie, I still have no freaking clue what the hell was going on. There seems to have been some sort of internet conspiracy to ""induce"" these suicides, but the conspiracy's reveal was incredibly anticlimactic and confusing. There was some adolescent pop group who had some obscure code with hand signals and jersey numbers or something that supposedly spelled out the word ""suicide"". Wow, that explains it! There also was some sort of organization promoting suicide headed by some flamboyantly gay glam-rocker who it seems, hated cats and dogs. Hated them so much that he kept fatally trampling them with his fancy platform shoes. But how he could anticipate the exact nature and number of the suicides was never explained. Or if it was, it sailed way beyond me. Was the pop group working with the glam-rocker? Who knows. Who cares. There was a good guy, a detective investigating the suicides. A pretty cool actor I thought. Too good for this movie. His family for no reason all killed themselves and then of course he had to follow suit. Was it that annoying pop song? There was also a heroine who was apparently also investigating the suicide club, But she was never developed. She somehow got captured and trapped in a bed sheet or something. Did she escape? I can't even remember. And I just saw this movie last night. A pretty good premise, surely a haunting one, but in my opinion, its execution was a confusing, steaming mess.",1434585600,,1891,4.661676646706587
1918250,5,B0000CC885,"In the years 2006-2008, before I had much interest in horror in general, I discovered the Japanese horror phenomenon with such films as Infection, Ju-On, Ringu, Audition, Three Extremes, Evil Dead Trap 2 and of course Takashi Miike's Gozu. I was lucky. I've since discovered that there was a lot of crap being floated across the Pacific that I serendipitously avoided, while as the same time discovering, almost by chance while browsing in the doomed cultural temple that was Blockbuster Video, rare gems such as Pulse and Suicide Club.

***

I need to read the book of this. I need to.

***

I've watched loads of Asian movies, overwhelmingly Japanese and mostly horror, and from Kurosawa's Stray Dog to the Splatter era Tokyo Gore Police, I have never seen the police force depicted in any sort of positive light. And outside the aforementioned Stray Dogs, the police force is never treated especially realistically. I suspect that this is because Japan lacks anything like America's current obsession with the procedure of police work as depicted and often misrepresented on countless TV shows. This film is no exception. If you want to, make a drinking game  out of the ludicrous way in which the police task force here carries out its investigation, with double shots for every time someone tries to dismiss something as a ""prank"" which is obviously anything but.

***

Granted not many people out there are into classic Greek drama anymore, but it helped me to realize that this piece is structured a lot more like a Euripides or Sophocles. The hapless police task force serves the same function as the choir would; we're not supposed to focus on their tactical and investigatory reactions so much as their emotional and philosophical ones as representative of those of established ""adult"" Japanese society to the rash of suicides that crop up without any apparent cause, but which seem increasingly to be an expression of Japanese youth.
Indeedand a big SPOILER follows herealthough we really don't find out much about the ""Suicide Club"" (which, as we learn from the associated movie Noriko's Dinner Table, is more than just a club and concerns itself with far more than just inciting mass suicides), we do learn that it seems to be an organization that turns on its the age-hierarchy that is so essential to Asian cultures: the youngest of the children seem to have the greatest power, the highest degree of initiation.

***

The police force here may not be good for much, but look at the faces of the actors. What incredible, expressive faces; what an amazing range of faces to represent the crotchety society that the ""Suicide Club"" is rebelling against.

***

Genesis both is and is not responsible for what has been happening, I'm guessing.

***

Again, from an American standpoint, it's very weird that there's no one protagonist to follow through the whole movie. The police don't come in until after the unforgettable first scene and then an interlude in a hospital that seems extraordinarily long when you consider that we barely ever revisit that setting. Once the police plot-line is established, it feels as though that ""is"" the film, and it comes as something of a surprise when, in the movie's endgame, we jump focus to the character of Mitsuko (Sayako Hagiwara), whose face graces the cover of most DVD editions, but who seemed up until this point only a tangential character.
I think writerdirector Shion Sono himself realized that this structure confused some audiences, maybe not only Western ones, and that this is the reason why he was so careful to break up his follow up Noriko's Dinner Table into discreet chapters, each with a unique point of view.

The time has come for an American remake of this film starring One Direction as Dessart/Dessert",1429228800,,3777,4.9089481946624804
1918251,4,B0000CC885,"Very good movie with plenty of gore and a strong message about the Japanese culture.

Visually, the movie looks like grind house or a B-Movie which is perfectly fitting. There's an excessive amount of blood and some striking visuals but it doesn't detract from the story or message (at least for me, but I love horror/slasher/gore flicks).
The story is good with a few plot holes and some unanswered questions, but it leaves a little room for interpretation. Some understanding of the high suicide rate in Japan, their culture as a whole (especially in Tokyo), and Buddhist belief can certainly help ones understanding of the subject matter.
I look @ it as a bloody Pied Piper story to some degree but there's a lot more to it which I won't get into.
This movie has a large cult following and for good reason. I especially loved the homage to the Rocky Horror  Picture Show with Rolly (Genesis in the film)!

1918261,4,B0000CC885,"Suicide Club (or as some would prefer to call it, Suicide Circle) is the kind of film that somehow manages to do something unthinkable, and manages to outdo just about every Japanese horror film of its kind in terms of depicting completely over-the-top nightmarish visceral imagery while still leaving enough surrealist legroom, so to speak, to still speak for itself as a work of genuine social commentary. Despite its sometimes vulgar approach, there isn't a dull moment where the idea comes across as heavy-handed, and that right there is quite an accomplishment for the kind of film that it is. Sion Sono has a way of exploring dark subject matter in a way that is realistic and blunt while still allowing the audience to reflect on the irony of it all. His films are hilarious without being comedies. They depict outrageous imagery and situations in a way that is both jarring yet still somewhat at home with the overall tone of the world he has slowly built with his colorful pictures. To be fair, Suicide Club is his most flawed piece of work due to the fact that it has far too many red herrings for its own good, and even though watching the film never feels like a chore (unless you are, of course, put off by extremely graphic and disturbing scenes of blood and gore soaked carnage, in which case I suggest you stay far away from this film for its even more shocking than most films of its kind), the aftertaste of the piece itself will be nearly impossible to swallow. The film still has the jagged edges of an artist who hasn't fully realized what he is doing. I've watched the film at least eight times now, and I can really only describe the events of the film up to a point. The material and the story line and explored much more deeply and powerfully in the brilliant follow-up feature, Noriko's Dinner Table, which gives us the answers to nearly all of the questions that still linger in our minds when Suicide Club ends, while still introducing new ones. It's one of the best films Sion Sono has made, and I'll definitely get to that film later because there's a lot of stuff I want to say about it, but until then there are some noteworthy things about this film that I found worthy of attention and examination.

One of the most distinct elements of this film is its energetic soundtrack, much of which is very upbeat and light-hearted. The soundtrack is actually, unashamedly I might add, the most important aspect of the film in figuring out its plot. Most people I know who have viewed this film usually are left most confused by what is actually happening in the climax of the picture. The film has a lot of plot for the kind of film it is, and so its highly likely that if you are lost early on you are definitely not going to understand the ending. To me this is really funny because I figured out the ending relatively early on during my first viewing and was actually left more confused by the barrage of plot tangents the film goes on throughout its 100 minute runtime, starting with Se7en-esque forensic crime scene investigation involved fried flesh and a mysterious police district caller, and eventually ending with a scene (featuring perhaps the weirdest use of CGI I have ever seen in a film) that involves a highly disturbing revelation of a cult that puts the main female character in a painful situation behind a concert wall in which a piece of her body is, essentially, turned into a plot point. The film never gets so off track that we lose track of what's going on, but after the film has concluded there is an awful lot to really take into consideration before the viewer can really feel completely satisfied. I think that this could have been solved with a longer running time, ironically enough. The film's runtime is not enough for us to truly feel immersed in the world created by such a mad filmmaker, and I think that Sono should have let the film speak for itself more. It already is memorable enough in its grisly story. The audience will be on board with it, regardless of how long and ponderous it is. There's no need to bite off more than you can chew with a story this complex. Not that it would even be possible to lose track of a film in which the plot involves a rash of suicides that occur all over Japan after fifty four smiling school girls commit suicide by jumping in front of a train in an underground subway tunnel. This is the film that the accidentally brilliant American film The Happening should have been but didn't have the balls to be.

Suicide Club features scenes that are so scary and so gory that it would make Dario Argento cringe. However, these scenes take place during under such intensely illuminating circumstances that its difficult to truly make heads or tails as to whether or not what you're seeing is real in the context of the film or if its just a character's nightmare. There is one scene in particular, involving a group of kids on the roof of a building, that is so brilliantly and powerfully written and acted that I think it will haunt me forever. We even get a subplot, reminiscent of Brian DePalma's Phantom of the Paradise if that film were about the Manson family murders and featured male sex servants, that is simply a majestic spectacle to behold. Again, it is a surprising turn of events that comes out of nowhere, but again it doesn't feel out of place in the plot. Ultimately, I think that is the film's biggest strength. It is a dreamlike picture in which the events never feel too over-the-top to be unbelievable or unrealistic, but still seem bizarre enough that they surprise and shock you. The film could have just been nothing but a series of shocks and spectacles. As it stands, it still features graphic scenes of bodily mutilation and death that are jawbreaking and breathtaking in their unbelievable cruelty. As I also mentioned, Noriko's Dinner Table perfects all the imperfections that this film has with its plot while still managing to be a stand alone film. However, the imagination of the plot, the intelligent social commentary, the surrealism, the element of realism that is always present, the realistically emotional performances by Ryo Ishibashi as a tormented detective and Sayako Hagiwara as a young girl whose boyfriend is an early victim in the picture, the unpredictable nature of the plot, the Twin Peaks-style plot twists, the dramatic tension of the characters, and the overall interesting police investigation of a crime spree that can't really be stopped give the film the kind of atmosphere it needs to make it a seriously horrifying and thought-provoking gorefest.",1380499200,,6602,4.656383890317052
1918262,5,B0000CC885,"I've seen this three times, and I was finally able to piece together my analysis of what Sion's message was; it's multi-layered, and not as simple as some have written on the internet.  If you watch his other movies, there's a lot of commentary on how ""Japan is slow to change"" and it's known that Japan has the highest suicide rate in the world (check that fact, but definitely in the developed world).  His message is to bring awareness to that, and to the fact Japan is slow to do anything to change, lacking even the recognition of the problem, always trying to blame something else.  The pop culture element has been said by some that he means ""Japan is committing cultural suicide"", and sure, I buy that's one layer of his message, but it goes deeper, down into the literal.  The pop culture was one vehicle by which he could show that on one hand, Japanese institutions are slow to change, to adapt, and to see the real issues in Japan causing problems.  There is a bit of a stretch on some parts to take the movie completely literally (just watch the final few scenes, those are hard to swallow as ""real"").

Still, I think my higher level point is many criticize it as scattered, or has ""kruft"" in it. I think most all pieces fit together.  I also applaud him for moving on to Noriko's Dinner Table, which I also recommend, as while it stands on its own as a movie, it's a backdrop to Suicide Club/Circle for some elements, and really completes the message imho.

Watch it.  Be disturbed.  If it makes you think, good.  That's the point.

1918265,1,B0000CC885,"I watched this film after reading a review about it on YAHOO. After viewing it I have to say although it is an unorthodox, weird film, Its the kind of film that has philosophies so out the norm that it will shake you. There is a reason why your spirit feels a certain way after watching something. If its not a good feeling, then there's a reason why. Especially if you are sensitive to certain philosophies and ideas. Evil/Satan/Darkness, whatever you wish to call it has only one motive. TO STEAL, KILL AND DESTROY. Any film that presents suicide as a ""sensible"" way out of something is promoting ""Death"". What's even worse is that it makes light of the subject. Suicide is a serious subject matter, and I'm not sure where Sono's mind was when he did this film. Maybe a little desperate/suicidal himself. Not sure.

I read he had an incident where he ran away from home to Tokyo (like the main character in Noriko's Dinner Table, the loose sequel to this movie) and he ran into a woman who was looking for a hotel room. Him, thinking she wanted to make out with him (he was still a virgin) went up to the hotel room, where she tried to initiate a group suicide with him with a huge pair of scissors. She didn't want to ""die alone"". Well, after reading that I can see where he got the idea from, but as much as that was a release of his personal trauma, he released it into Japan (who also hate the film) and the world (funny no one else has tried to remake this, especially Hollywood after the hundred other remakes in the 2000's).
Why is pretty obvious. This film has the potential to initiate its own suicide wave to weakened individuals.

The philosophies here seem interesting at first, but after thinking about it for a day (i haven't been able to think about anything else) I'm pretty sure they are demonic. They make the intellectual actual sit back and ponder on the ideas in the film, and any pondering on suicide is NOT healthy. All this ""do you have a connection with yourself? With your family, loved ones, if so, why don't you kill yourself? You will still have those connections in death, so why are you living?"" Is pretty demented. Its twisting one's mind to think that killing one's self the way out of their pain. Its a way out alright, to HELL if you're not saved. Life is about living for whats right, love and creation. Not encouraging death and destruction. And not only do they kill themselves, but they do so in the most destructive, horrifying ways. DEMONIC. Quick rundown if you are confused after watching: 54 girls join hands and commit mass suicide in front of a subway train. Smiling sickly by the way. A roll of skin is found afterwards. Its from the girls and others that have died from suicide. The suicide club legend is born. Others do copycat suicides. Its the new craze. Mid-way we are thrown off a little to find a transvestite is behind it all. Well, not really, because after he is caught, even more suicides happen. Come to find out the J-Pop group Dessert is behind it with subliminal messages in their music/promotion that promotes girls to seek them out, go to this underground ""skin peeling room"" to get their skin shaved off and connected for the skin rolls and commit suicide together from a demented philosophy. Thats it in a nutshell. No reason why the kids/Desert group is doing it. Or who they learned this ""wisdom"" from. Which is funny because none of them commit suicide. They just ask everyone else, including a detective in the film, why they are still living, and that they are ""scum"" for doing so. DEMONIC. Thats what demons say to weakened people to push them over the edge (which works in the detective's case, he kills himself after his family succumbs to the madness).

For those absolute horror fans, you will check this out anyway, but Christians and people of faith and high intellectual levels beware, its a film that will really push you to the edge (and God forbid for the weak minded maybe over the edge) with its philosophies. If you are going to watch it, just guard your mind and don't ponder too much on it's meaning/philosophy because to be honest, I don't think the director even had a serious direction with it it's so all over the place. Its more like a senseless bad nightmare rather than a well plotted out movie.

Since you won't get any answers from the open plotholes, read this interview of the director. You will at least see where his mind was and where he drew inspiration from some pretty horrific life experiences for the film: [...]",1351728000,,4521,4.529987760097919
1918266,3,B0000CC885,"(I will probably refer to this film as Suicide Circle, since that is the proper name of the film, and the circle reference is key to this film and the subsequent film and novel).

The main problem with Suicide Circle is that the film can't decide if it is a serious and shocking look into modern Japanese youth culture or if it is a satire of said society.  I actually felt it would have been better as more of a satire, though a more serious film could have also been just as potent.  The moments of silly-over-the-top blood spraying indicate satire.  But then the gruesome scenes of rolls of skin and such say serious and disturbing.

I bought the unrated for $4.99 from iTunes (sorry Amazon - it was only $1 more to buy and not rent).  The unrated has a few additional scenes or extended scenes:

*slightly prolonged subway suicide scene showing girls head getting crunched.
*slightly longer scene with the mom sawing her fingers off while cutting daikon.
*Slightly longer shot of the person shooting himself in head showing back of head blowing off.
*the severed ear being pushed off the school roof
*the Japanese David Bowie guy stomping to death a cloth covered cat and dog

The issue is that we see the story start and then fizzle into various unresolved plot threads. Understandably, the director intended this to be a trilogy.  But by the end of the film, the viewer is confused, and the one thread we seem to finally get is completely wrong according to the novel that was published later.  There is also a second film, based on the novel:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Noriko-s-Dinner-Table/dp/B001570H5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Noriko's Dinner Table</a>.  Without giving things away - the novel and later film start a few months before the events in Suicide Circle and end a year or so after the original film.  There is a completely different story line involved, and the viewer actually gets some answers.  Though the answers have very little to do with the plot threads started in Suicide Circle.

But it's an interesting film despite the many shortcomings.  It was filmed on a budget, which is obvious from the get go.  The acting is uneven, and the film appears to have been shot with a home camera.  Still, I respect people for creating interesting films on a budget.  But the plot does progress as if the director decided that he wanted to shift gears three times and start a new plot thread without clearing up the events of the previous half hour.

I just wanted more of the Japanese version of David Bowie (Rolly of the band Scanch).  Kudos for his evil song in a film moment.  I think more villains should sing to their victims while wearing sequined outfits with platform shoes.

If you can get through the first 5 minutes of the film, then there really isn't too much to shock you more than that.  Other than the horrifying skin roll.  And the finger sawing moment is kind of intense.  The creepy smiling mom and the weird kid looking at her are more unsettling than the actual knife sawing through the obviously fake hand.",1351036800,,3693,5.344290657439446

1918268,4,B0000CC885,"This was a good movie, it was incredibly bloody, and a little (or a lot) over my head at points, but overall it had impact. And it was scary, not just in the blood and gore way, in the psychological way. I could actually imagine something like this happening, if on a smaller scale. In fact, I wouldn't be at all surprised if it did. It was dramatized nearly to the point of being ridiculous, but that just made it more memorable. (I would have been tempted to pull out 5 stars if the blood didn't look like dyed water.)

SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!

At first I was just confused. Mainly about why no one noticed 54 girls holding hands at the edge of the platform chanting 'a one and a two...'. Unfortunately, I finished the film, and am still confused on a few things, including that, but it doesn't bother me as much as that usually would.

I was reading another review, and the reviewer said they thought Desert didn't mean to inspire a rash of suicides, and that was why they stopped performing. I have to agree. Not once when the creepy children are talking do they mention suicide or that the world would be just fine without you, they seem to exist for the sole purpose of making people think not just about how they fit in to society (which seems to be the main concern of most) but how they 'connect' to themselves. In other words, they want to know if you're living solely for others (ref Desert's 'Mail Me') or for yourself.

Most of the people we see are living for others, a faceless piece of the whole that is society. The prime example of this is on the school roof, when the student gets up on the ledge and says she'll jump. She's not serious at all, because when her classmates join her she is the last to jump. Simply following the crowd, she had no connection to herself, nothing outside of her friends to sustain her.

On the other side we have the lunatic and his fake Suicide Club, he is so completely connected to himself he doesn't care about anything else. Neither the student or the lunatic are truly connected to Desert, they are just there to make Desert's purpose clearer.

The student and her classmates also serve to show the effect of fads (even if it IS suicide) on society.
Now the creepy kids, I still don't really get except that they ARE connected to Desert.
And speaking of Desert, I just have to say, when the girl was making a coded message reading suicide off one of the group's posters I thought it was a bit of a stretch. But it does explain why so many people who were on the skin chains committed suicide: they were desperate for a way out, just as the girl was desperate for the reason her boyfriend killed himself, and in thier desperation they saw something that wasn't really there.

This got unintentionally long, I feel like this is the sort of movie you have to show to your friends just so you can talk about it....but any way, it was a good movie, a lot better than I expected. I might even watch it again to see what I missed.",1347062400,,3074,4.430088495575221

1918271,3,B0000CC885,"I'm kind of surprised after watching ""Suicide Club"" I actually didn't intend to at first. I saw the clip of the subway train jumping on the net like years ago and wondered where it was from but never cared to watch the movie. Some years later I check out a movie called Noriko's Dinner Table and this movie is referenced throughout it well the primary incident at least. I thought Noriko's Dinner table was pretty good strange but good so I thought I'd give this a try.

After reading reviews about how people were disappointed at Noriko's Dinner table for not being a direct sequel I honestly don't get why. Compared to the 2 Noriko's dinner table was by far a better movie because it was complete,quirky,deep, and entertaining. I expected the same when I watch suicide club but what could have been a great film just turned into a waste of time.

The first half of the movie starts off like a great film. Your genuinely interested in seeing what happens and solving the mystery. The film starts out with a group of girls jumping onto a railway. Probably what makes this movie famous and so talked about...then it has some odd occurrences with people killing themselves. The story has 3 main characters. 1. The cop, 2. The cute girl on the cover, and 3. The hacker chick. I only call them main characters because the events that happen to them are all turning points in the story. You start out following the cop which is by far the best part of this movie. **maybe spoiler nah not really** Something happens to him and the movie you were just watching ends right there. All of a sudden Suicide Club turns into a musical. This movie goes from Suspenseful horror to ""is this a joke?"" quick! Norkio's Dinner table had that same eerie yet goofy atmosphere but it had it throughout the movie. It didn't all of a sudden turn into a completely different movie half way through it.

The moment the rock star starts singing you can consider this film over. The movie killed it's own self. From there you jump to the 2nd Main Character the Hacker and for some reason you never know what becomes of her character. It's just like the writers forgot to finish her story. Then from there we go back to the cute girl on the cover. Who solves the mystery of Suicide Club then the movie gets even weirder then it just ends with another  lame song. I honestly thought people where killing themselves because they had to listen to that horrible ""Dessert"" Pop group and that freaking song ""call me"" that stuck in my freaking head! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! ""CALL ME DA DA DA DA DA DA"" ""MAIL ME DA DA DA DA DA!"" some one kill me!

Ahhhhh.... ok what was I saying now... That's right, I don't understand what the message was or what the point of this film was. I really don't get what this movie was trying to be. Noriko's Dinner Table said more about the suicide Club and what it was more than the movie ""Suicide Club"" only that in Noriko's Dinner table no one physically killed them selves they mentally killed themselves by acting as another person until they no longer could connect with who they once were. That and some other stuff it was a really good film. Suicide Club is just outright confusing. Once the 1st main character is out the scene the movie turns into something else that I wasn't interested in watching honestly.

I give this move 3 stars for the first half of it. It's too unique to give it less than that really (first half only other half is a POS!). The rest of the movie can kiss the Dvd case... not worth your time to watch.",1283817600,,3533,4.419354838709677

1918273,5,B0000CC885,"If the purpose of art is to invoke emotion and thought, Sion Sono's SUICIDE CLUB is then art in its highest form. It is impossible to view the film without being thoroughly shocked, disgusted, and questioned at every moment. The plot centers around a rash of suicides that overtakes Japan's youth, causing students and even several adults to throw themselves in front of trains, jump from the rooftops, and even dismember themselves in a variety of gruesome deaths. As the police work to unravel the mystery behind the recent fad, the clues point to a communication breakdown between the family, community, and one's self, a wedge that has been driven deeper by the increased importance of television, cell phones, and the Internet in society. Sono's script also comments on a generation disenchanted and desensitized by sensationalism in the media, and the effects violence can have on the impressionable minds of the youth. SUICIDE CLUB is commonly cited for its scenes of extreme gore which are both jarring and memorable, but the picture cannot be reduced to (or dismissed as) a cheap shocker. After an excellent build and perfectly constructed mystery surrounding the phenomena, the main complaint becomes the climactic reveal, which proves to be far too cerebral to provide a satisfying end. Although the film is unquestionably horrific, its themes transcend the genre and is socially significant given the growing distance in human interaction as a result of the information age.

Total bloodbath.

Questions abound after this apparent mass suicide.  The police launch an immediate investigation as this grisly scene echoes in the hearts of the youth everywhere nearby.  But how can you stop such a random, impulsive act of violence?

This story quickly shows some mercy as it gets more surreal and inconceivable.  There is a strange website that predicts these so-called suicides, which indicates some hint of premeditation and manipulation.  Plus a bag turns up containing a bizarre wheel of human skin, pieced together from the young victims.  More bizarre clues emerge as the police race to stop anymore tragic deaths, which are becoming a popular fad amongst the kids.

It's safe to say that Hollywood won't be picking up the rights to this one.  The premise is just too dang alarming.  Plus it hints at how easily influenced our kids might be.

People here have been saying that the movie somehow represents the ""disconnection"" that people in societies have on towards their human side; we have indulged ourselves into jaded lives, wrapped into other meaningless pursuits such as the media, materialistic possessions, etc. But that theme is still a length away from why these actual sucides occur. The film introduces a variety of vectors that drives this, whether it is those creepy little girl band or that blond haired emo band guy (for lack of a better description...) but I think that it is wrong to assume that any of these forces are directly behind the cause of the suicides. Talk about confusing. Now, the gist of this movie isn't about the physical links present in traditional murder-horror who-dun-it tales. Heck, the director may have not even realized all the possibilities and deep philosophical concepts that may spring up. It's peoples imaginations and their creativity that makes their reasoning come alive. This film is worth a look, o matter what conclusions you may draw in the end.

Now add to that the ability to explode like a David Letterman watermelon every time our bodies impact something hard.  While, Westerners in other movies merely hit the ground with an unprotesting thud, the sound Asian bodies make when they hit concrete in Sion Sono's  Suicide Club is halfway between an ornate Baroque (nee. taco-bell) flatulence and a Jackson Pollack drip painting made inside a mosh pit.

Show offs.

Sion Sono's film Suicide Club, for me, is a film about the erosion of Japanese culture.  While it gives a nod in the direction of Robert Bresson (mentioned in the script), it also draws from the work of Michael Haneke (A Bresson disciple).  The speculation of cultures that are so steeped in rote repetition they have all but lost sight of their purpose in existence, is a driving theme behind Haneke's 7th Continent (where a family who tries to break free of daily drudgery by suicide ends up applying the identical 9-5 formula to killing themselves).

A film that is not traditionally resolved by ""answers"" is bound to stumble audiences, but the Suicide Club shows many hints along the way.  Consider the discovery of the ""skin-scroll,"" a scroll of human skin stitched together into a continuous riddle without words.  The Japanese E-Makimono picture scroll is a tradition that presented storytelling in horizontal scrolls during the Kamakura period (11th-14h century) in Japan. The rich visual allusion to human flesh being incorporated into a scroll depicting recent event serves to illustrate how even the media of a traditional art form has changed.  If anything, the Suicide Club is a story of time and the force of change.  It's no surprise that the greatest point of tension is a train station, where by definition, a schedule of an arriving train is defined by a clock.

The Suicide Club reminds me of Chan is Missing in that it tries to solve a mystery by inspecting peripheral evidence.  It goes down many wrong leads, but those wrong leads inevitably turns up new insights into the problem at hand.  Look at the first suspect: People with tattoos. The police first saw a suspect in people with tattoos.  In airports in Japan, passengers with tattoos are often associated with the Yakuza (Japanese mafia) and consequently denied entry into the country.  That lead - much like the tendency to blame all of society's ills on the most convenient culprit: gangs- led nowhere.  Next, a mysterious internet user by the name of ""the bat"" was traced down.  But when the bat gets kidnapped by a bunch of rock-and-rollers, despite all their posturing of sporting blond hair, acting like a cross between David Bowie, Dr. Frank-n-Furter, and Mad Max's Toecutter, they get caught, and it appears that neither the cultural imperialism from the West, nor the pervasive internet (the reduction of lives into mere dots, an allusion to the pixelated representation of the modern self online) had anything to do with the murders.  (An observation here: Japanese guerilla films have a tendency to use Western motifs during tremendous acts of violence: witness opera and the music of Bach being utilized during execution style scenes in Battle Royale, blond-haired Asian villains in the films of Takashi Miike, and Gaelic jigs sounded right before the Suicide Club's 54 students hop onto the oncoming train in the opening scene, no doubt a legacy of associating all things West with...*cough* Hiroshima... violence)

So who is killing the kids of Japan? I think all signs point to the youth of today.  It eventually becomes apparent that the children, the up-and-coming generation, are the ones who are destroying culture as Japanese people have known it to be.  The children are the gallery of peers even the heroine has to answer to in the climactic moment of self-realization.  The child band ""Dessart"" separates Detective Kuroda's family's attention when he calls for a kitchen table meeting with wife and kids.  A poster of the prepubescent pop group reveals an abstract code of numbers imparted by hand signs.  The school kids egg each other on to suicide during a school lunch break.

Ironically, (and like Haneke's 7th Continent) the model of traditional Japanese conformism is being outmoded not by individuality; it is being replaced by *another* form of conformism.  So the route of escape presented by the new generation is nothing but a repackaged brand of group allegiance.

The utterance of ""how much one is connected to oneself""- for example- is the moral of the story.  Combining Japanese Kata (the correct and only way to do something"") and Japanese etiquette (hospitality consisting of sparing others inconvenience) one immediately sees how these traditional ways are rendered obsolete when the modern man selfishly considers his connection to himself (before his traditional Japanese consideration to his fellow man) and randomly jumps to his death from a balcony.  Because he didn't take the trouble to see if anyone was below, he lands on a girl, who, instead of being concerned about a dying friend in the street, rushes into a bar, gloating over how she may have been physically deformed from someone landing on her. The focus of the phrase ""connection to oneself"" is played out repeatedly in how the folks of present day are so self-absorbed, they have lost touch with the tradition of the Japanese Kata.

In the final scene, when detective Shibusawa runs to the train station to ""save"" Mitsuko.  She rejects his hand and instead -on her own volition- steps into a train that takes her away (into the future).  For me, the Suicide Club is both a critique of the conformity in Japanese culture, and an ethnographic inspection of how that culture is attempting to break away from the traditional codes.

However, is it really breaking away?  After all, every train's destination eventually leads to the station it departed from.",1230681600,,5942,5.002032520325203

1918282,4,B0000CC885,"SUICIDE CLUB (aka. Suicide Circle, Jijatsu Saakuru) is a bleak and dark satire that effectively masquerades as a horror film. Directed by Sion Sono (Strange Circus), this film is a shocking commentary on the effect of pop culture on a country's young population (and in general). Sion Sono is at his top form here, it has been said that the director decided to make this film after the true-to-life suicide of a close friend. With its shocking and disturbing imagery, it somewhat threatens to obscure the effective message that concerns the media manipulation of the population's moral system. Having the similar themes of sadness, desperation and frustration similar to films like ""Battle Royale"" or others by Takashi Miike and Kiyoshi Kurosawa, the film is one effective blend of gore, horror, dark comedy and a social commentary.

54 Japanese schoolgirls seemingly await to board a subway train. They hold hands and in unison, all 54 girls jump off the platform in front of an oncoming train with a smile on their faces. The resulting blood-splattering event may push even the most reasonable man to be driven insane (a horror fan will take notice). A bag is left on the scene, with a roll of patches of human skin, stitched together. Soon after, unexplained suicides are occurring all over Tokyo, more bags with stitched up human skin are found, and the authorities appear helpless to do a thing given the nature of the deaths, opening a murder case is a challenge by itself. Questions and more deaths arise, What is the purpose of the bag with stitched up skin? What does a supposedly innocent band and a website have to do with the suicides? The country is on the verge of social anarchy as the police turn to a cyber jockey called ""The Bat"" to shed some light on the mystery.

Those familiar with Japanese existential themes will no doubt be at home Sion Sono's impressive and disturbing ""Lynchian-like"" mind-bending satire. The director tackles the effect of popular culture head-on with a truly bleak vision as to how the media can affect how people dress, what to think and exactly what to watch on television. So why not have the media portray suicide as the ""in"" thing to do? So it is far-fetched, and quite an unlikely scenario; but one thing that cannot be denied is that ""Suicide Club"" certainly gets its point across. Sono seems to be saying that people has to learn to think for themselves, do what you believe is best and to not allow what TV and magazines decide what's ""cool to do"" and what's ""hip"" at the time. While the film has a very valid advice, it executes the message in a truly surrealistic manner, that it almost seems to unfold in a parallel reality where the bizarre and the macabre are not just a way to present the gory events but serves as a social commentary.

Numerous explanations for the suicides are suggested in the film; subliminal messages, a cross dressing Marilyn Manson wannabe, a curious website, they may all be the causes of the deaths but it never gives a clear explanation as to why. It borrows some elements we may have seen once before, but it still couldn't be denied that the film presents a very odd way of getting its message across. It is this lack of explanations that will definitely attract fans of Lynch-like films and the imagery will attract the fans of Takashi Miike's unorthodox style of execution. However, while this may be the film's greatest asset, it may also prove to be its greatest weakness. The lack of solid explanations will undoubtedly alienate and frustrate a lot of viewers looking for solid conclusions. No easy answers are presented, but keep in mind that the film also has a METAPHORICAL style, the effects of the media in America are quite powerful but not as intensely felt as in Japan.

With all this mayhem and disorder, a sympathetic and likeable detective named Kuroda is played by Ryo Ishibashi. Detective Kuroda is a very fortunate man with a beautiful wife and two wonderful children. However, the things that are unfolding may serve to destroy all he has in a very horrifying way. The film's cinematography definitely gives the proceedings a surrealistic and eerie approach that presents the gore in a partly distorted fashion. The overdose of blood and gore can be quite depressing to watch, after a few minutes, you may feel like you have to pause and watch something else. I experienced this same feeling when I watched Sion Sono's ""Strange Circus"" (the 2nd film I saw directed by Sono), I'm not exactly sure why I'm repulsed but at the same time drawn to this director's work.

While ""Suicide Club"" may not be a perfect film, horror fans will be drawn to its bleak and bloody premise. It is clever and insightful on what it is trying to tell the audience. The film is not for the squeamish, and a strong stomach is definitely required. The film is very graphic that makes it unsuitable for young teens which is such a shame, since the film does encourage young people to think for themselves, be independent rather than to just follow a crowd; youngsters are the most vulnerable to commercialism. But with the film's bloody and graphic sequences, it would be ill-advised for young teens to watch it.

""Suicide Club"" is Sono's cry to move away from the brink of social collapse and a subtle commentary on the spiritual death of a society embodied by suicidal behavior. Quite ironic that youngsters are the ones to serve as martyrs as well as the adult's tormentors.

After that, the next 20 minutes or so it had an eerie feel to it. During the middle of the movie however, I began to fall asleep as it started to slow down. Everything after the first 30 minutes of this movie I was like ""Huh? What? Ok...I think I get it now.."" and as the movie ends, i'm back to ""What? I don't get it"". Yes, i know sort of confusing -- which is what this film was to me. Part of me(and I think most people here in America would agree) that a bunch of kids getting together to commit suicide for the hell of it is just plain stupid. I think the writers and directors tried to go beyond something so simple, but I don't think it went very well.

At best, you'll think this movie is ""O.K."". The ratings for this movie stand true, it deserves no more than 3 1/2 stars.",1201910400,2,948,4.06951871657754

I felt the movie was done in very poor taste. There is a way to handle the subject but it was almost as if they filmed this movie because ""ohh suicide! What a marvel!"" By no means am I bashing the movie because of the gore, gore is a part of our reality but the movie lacked a tasteful plotline. I have to say the skin shreds were a bit much as well.

I'm sure things like this do happen but when you put it into a film there's a line between being real and taking it too far. I strongly advise no one under 17 to watch this movie.

1918285,5,B0000CC885,"With an opening scene so shocking and disturbing as to be deemed infamous by many, 2002's Jisatsu saakuru (aka Suicide Club) grabs you by the throat, thrashes you around for an hour or so, temporarily morphs into some kind of weird rock and roll opera, gives you another kick in the solar plexus, and then bids you on your way - a little confused about what the heck you just witnessed.  The film will probably be just a little bit too open to interpretation for Western audiences, but by gum I freaking loved this movie.  While American horror directors seem to base all of their films on a shared database of five scripts, the Japanese are continuing to revolutionize the horror film day in and day out.

If you've ever heard of this film from director Sion Sono, you probably already know how the movie opens.  You've got a group of Japanese school girls (fifty-four in all) talking and giggling one minute, and then joining hands and jumping in front of an oncoming train the next.  I wanted to stand up and applaud right here in my room because it's so shocking and so well done.  Yes, we gorehounds can critique the manner in which the blood first appears, but no one can question the effectiveness of so much blood literally going everywhere.  Shinjuku Station almost instantaneously turns into Splatter City, baby.  The cops, led by Detective Kuroda (Ryo Ishibashi) investigate, but there's not much they can do about a mass suicide - not until the pattern of suicides continues to the point that they have to consider the possibility that someone is murdering these kids in some kind of incomprehensible way.  The second scene of multiple suicides is almost as unnerving as the first, and as time goes on individuals - including adults - begin taking their own lives, as well, a fact which sort of undermines any cult group theories.  A couple of mysterious informers - one calling herself The Bat and the other a child who continually clears his throat after every sentence - as well as a distinctly weird web site provide some insight into the subject, but the clues they provide are pretty cryptic.  Believe it or not, events actually take an even darker turn later in the film.

As is so often the case with Japanese horror, some of the deeper aspects of this film may not make perfect sense to those unfamiliar with Japanese culture, but I daresay any horror fan cannot help but be impressed by what goes on here (those who can't stomach a little blood and gore, though, probably won't last very long).  It's a really dark story, and some of its central images are of the type that you won't be forgetting any time soon.  I'll admit that the story didn't answer all of my questions, especially at the end, but this is horror on the cutting-edge and I loved every minute of it.",1198108800,4,2790,4.61010101010101

When you watch this movie don't look for the B movie angle, look at the way the dialog makes this movie so disturbing. There is no other movie I have EVER seen that freaked me out so bad. I love this movie for doing that. And I realize that most Japanese directors are pretty F**#ed up in their thinking. They are talking about banning this movie in Japan. Check it out.

1918287,4,B0000CC885,"I only watched this movie after watching the original Japanese manga (comic book) upon which this was based.  The manga is creepy, agonizingly slow-paced, and leaves most readers a little ill.  The movie captured some of that with its depictions of popular music being used to influence mass suicide among young people.  One scene shows high school student talking about the suicides and deciding, seemingly on a lark, to do the same thing.  Suddenly they are standing on the edge of the roof and leaping.

The addition of a murderous glam rock band only makes the film confusing and, like many Japanese horror films, some of the cultural references and monologuing are tedious to Americans.

This is a good purchase if you like horror movies and want something outside of the regular hack-and-slash offerings in the West.",1195603200,,822,4.963503649635037
1918288,3,B0000CC885,"... is stripping-off bad tribal-tattoos (or, as Detective Shibusawa deems them, ""cheap tattoos"").

I am a huge fan of Ryo Ishibashi. His performance in Takashi Miike's ""dishon"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Audition/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Audition</a>) is truly unforgettable. And, while I was not expecting the same caliber of artistry, I did expect a film which was well-composed and semi-compelling. Unfortunately, this work managed neither. Even Ryo Ishibashi's tremendous talent could not rescue this film from mediocrity.

**Spoilers MAY follow**

Foremost, Sion Sono ""tipped his hand"" way too early. Within the first ten minutes of the film, the alleged ""twist"" becomes painfully obvious. Had the director restrained himself even a bit, the mystery might have been sustained ... but the answer was so blatant (way too much repetition of the same image)!! (Maybe Westerners are just jaded since subliminal-suggestions were a hot-topic in the 1980's).

Secondly, the ""red herring"" was artless. At no point is the viewer deceived. And adding insult to injury, Japanese rocker Rolly Teranishi makes an unreal appearance as a Charles Manson (""of the information age"") wanna-be ... and launches into a long, excruciating, bowling-alley rendition of ""Suicide Kiss"" (a song he did not pen). And, hey, I dig crazy ""cut-to-song"" moments (it's one of the reasons I love ""Katakuri-ke No Kfuku"") but, this is just an effort to garner teenage viewers (think: adding Marilyn Manson to some random film ... for no apparent reason ... and with him not performing original work).

The use of blood was playful ... but this technique was honed by Takashi Miike in ""Koroshiya 1"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ichi-the-Killer/dp/B0000CABGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ichi the Killer</a>)... before ""Suicide Club."" Still, this approach (the over-done, concentrated spray of Crayola-red blood) tends to work for surreal films (again, like ""Koroshiya 1""), so I am not entirely certain why Sion Sono employed it here.

The film stock is not the best and the cinematography is a bit shaky. So those who are expecting high-end shock-cinema may wish to look elsewhere. But, for those who are just seeking a thrill, this film delivers.

Reviewers here are giving the film a low-rating for ""sensitive subject-matter"" ... one has to wonder, did they READ the title? Have they ever seen shock-cinema? Yikes. I am simply granting this film three-stars as a result of giving-away too-much too-soon AND for sub-par writing.  Otherwise, it's ""watchable.""

Several American movies have had similar plots to this, but the whole feeling I had while watching it was that of an anime with live characters -- especially the end (which I won't reveal).

Other options: If you want creepy go with Takashi Miike's Audition, if you want twisted go with most anything Miike.

Interestingly that wasn't the craziest part of the film. A detective story with an almost Rod Serling twist, or a thriller with a detective setting? Either way this was and interesting look at cinema in general and Asian cinema in particular.

1918296,4,B0000CC885,"""Suicide Club"" is part horror film, part detective story, part social commentary. Early in the film I was thinking it may be one of the most important films most people will never see -- then bodies kept hitting the ground with crew members, obviously just out of frame, tossing large buckets of bright red blood directly at the screen, disregarding any laws of physics. So, the film's tone is a bit uneven.

A wave of suicides is infecting Japan -- the film begins with fifty-four school girls jumping into the path of an oncoming train, coating the onlookers on the platform with enough blood to convince even prom-queen Carrie to lighten up. The investigation team, led by ""Audition"" star Ryo Ishibashi, are baffled until a mysterious woman named ""The Bat"" directs them to a website, which features only a black screen lined with red and white dots. Red dots symbolize the women fatalities. White dots symbolize the men. Before a ""suicide"" occurs, a corresponding dot appears.

After some more disturbing deaths and grizzly clues (a large roll of sewed together patches of human skin, for instance), Ishibashi and his team narrow the suspects down to a guy who looks like a cross between Ziggy Stardust and Buffalo Bill from ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" or a teenie-bopper girl group called Dessart (Desert?).  Ziggy Buffalo tortures people in a bowling alley, both with knives and singing; Dessart seem to have the country hypnotized with a creepy hit song about e-mail.

Though there are a few gory shocks, which thankfully go a long way to deglamorize any idea of starting my own Suicide Club, I thought the horror aspects were the story's least compelling elements -- the overemphasis on splatter became more of a distraction as the story progressed. I can bleed in sympathy only so much.

What stayed with me was the film's emphasis on connectivity to explain the suicides -- stressing the disconnect between people and those they work and live with, as well as a person's connection with his/her self over time.

""Suicide Club"" is a flawed film with an important message lurking under all the silly gore, and with other Japanese horror films like ""Ringu"" and ""The Grudge"" getting weaker American remakes, this is one that, with tweaking by the right people, could improve upon the original and become really powerful.",1174608000,,2325,4.903307888040713

(I am going to be giving away a lot so be ready folks) There are purposeful reasons for the writers choices in the films as to their choices. If it was just a movie about the gore as said, than they would take more chances and be less suspenseful. The gore adds to the thought and meaning of the movie. IT IS NOT JUST A GORY FILM ALONE! The director interconnects different messages of the film in general as well as gives away at the end very clearly what convinced the people to kill themselves. Here I go on some of it. In the scene where one of the Detectives has just found out he killed himself he gets a call from the kid (who is a part of the process of making people feel like suicide is the right option). The kid says things along these lines: How can you not feel the connection with others? How can you separate your pain to others? He is called a scum.....After this he kills himself. In all of the suicides in this movie the people killing themselves do not seem unhappy, in fact they seem to kill based on a ""wise"" thought, or logic, a philosophy one could say. The thought that suicide could be the right decision is given more in the end when the kids are talking to the girl on the stage. DEATH is thought not to sever your connections, and actually to connect you to those who have killed themselves. You do not lose your connections if you kill yourself.

I enjoy Japanese films for the interesting glimpse into a psyche strongly influenced by a world of forced detachment and often unfeeling behavior. Often, Asian films address the disconnected feeling associated with a fast-paced, demanding industrialized society. Suicide Club normalizes the emtional pain of suicide into a 'what the heck' fad. Asian horror often delves into the forbidden. Viewers eagerly, though painfully, peek as if watching a train wreck. There is a statement. I've never seen an Asian film that didn't have one. That disconnection resulting from society's demands is paramount in this film. The presentation can be compared to the unconventional shocks and cold emptiness of A Clockwork Orange.

What starts off as a promising film somehow meanders into something altogether different. I wondered why this film was so popular with many viewers, and therefore I asked my cousin-in-law, who just recently returned from Japan, why the film was so popular? He told me that it really isn't. Now he was born in Kobe, Japan. He goes back every year, and just recently spent a longer period visiting relatives in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kobe.

Therefore, I asked his opinion of the film. And he told me that the film is not that good. And also that the film is not that popular with younger people his age in Japan. At least not among his friends. Anyway, the film starts off pretty decent, [Somewhat]. In the beginning a group of 54 students jump off a train station depot to their deaths. Later, nearby there is found a roll of skin which has some hidden meaning concerning the suicides. What appears to be the start of a creepy horror-type of film, then winds its way into a sort of mystery detective film.

The films main protagonist is a detective Kuroda, (Ryo Ishibashi) investigating these sudden suicides. And his only clue is that of the aforementioned roll of human flesh stitched together from each of the suicide victims. For me, it seems as if the films director was not sure on which direction to take the film. This film will probably appeal to some viewers, and likewise, will not appeal to others also. I did view the film three times before I decided that this was really not that good a film.

In the vein of ""Ju-On"" and ""Ringu""... definitely in the ballpark of ""Audition""... but less horror and a little more shock value.  Don't let that deter you.  For some people (and some movies) that's a good thing.  There have been movies such as ""Evil Dead"", ""Wicker Man"" and dare I say the appalling ""Doom Generation"" which have accumulated insane cult followings.  I think the same applies here.  It's hard to take the whole premise seriously, buckets of blood and all... but if you take it for what it is, it can be an enjoyable movie.  Cheesy, but entertaining.

I don't think I'm giving too much away by saying that the premise is just as the title suggests... an increasing number of mass suicides that occur in Tokyo.  Detectives investigate the deaths and try to determine a point of origin.  The outcome is, in my opinion, one of those predictable 'twists' that you can see coming from the first hint of foreshadowing.  But... still an interesting one.

1918306,3,B0000CC885,"there's something impenatrable about eastern culture sometimes. perhaps suicide does mean something different in japan, with suicide pacts becoming more common as people seek to escape whatever hand life has dealt with them. either way a bizarre mass suicide and a host of copycats, along with some gruesome scene-of-the-crime evidence leads some tokyo detectives to ponder whether it's ""too much tv"" or whether more sinister forces are at work. especially since a website is revealed to show dots representing suicides as they happen. soon suicide becomes the latest craze and, like every fad, everyone's doing it.

this film contains some extraordinary scenes, the most vaunted being the mass suicide at the start. another sees more schoolkids boasting about how they're all gonna commit suicide, talking about the idea until someone steps on the ledge and everyone follows, because otherwise they's feel left out, right? other people have slightly more sophisticated takes on it, like the 4 women who choose to hang themselves before they ""murder someone"".

the lingering impression i got at times was loneliness. see the faces on the subway travellers - despondent and tired - and compare them to those around you on your next trip to and from work (see also the ant/ subway scene on the superb 'oldboy'). see too the scene where the cop comes home from work and clings to his wife like she's the only thing that's real, and she asks him what's happened - what does it take sometimes to shake us from the torpor of our daily lives? does it take a shock like this to make us feel alive and to value what we have? maybe loneliness is the modern disease and this consumerism is what we use to paper the cracks. more intelligent people than me can debate this, i just look forward to hearing their thoughts.

for all the digs at consumerism and pop culture (found that scene near the end where the schoolgirls descending the subway steps all start answering their mobiles REALLY disturbing), had to laugh at the fact that they do have a list of brands on the end credits. inapropriate or satire? reckon it's the former; that or the companies feel they're being REALLY edgy.

the film does have some major flaws. most obvious one being that you never get fully to grips with it, it seems to switch direction every time you think you know where it's going until it descends into pure weirdness. red herring after red herring. and what the hell is with that guy at the bowling alley? if he's a singer i suggest he gives up the day job sharpish. either that or write better songs

overall i will watch this film again and would recommend it, but be warned that the film throws up more questions than it's prepared to answer. whether the writer(s) lost their way or couldn't sustain the point, or maybe the audience of children with all their questions (sample ""what's your connection to yourself?"") and those chicks (baby chickens, not women) mean something and i'm too dense to figure it out. i just feel this film, while thought provoking, could have been so much more.",1147478400,4,3067,4.768361581920904
1918307,4,B0000CC885,"Do not expect to understand this movie fully! Well, it does not have a confusing storyline (it is told quite straitforward) and I have seen my share of bizarre Japanese films, but it is one of those movies, where at the end you scratch your head and ask youself if you have missed something. Maybe it takes a greater intellectual than me but the end of the film quite confused me... However this does not indicate that I regret having watched the DVD! On the contrary, SUICIDE CLUB is a hugely  entertaining and well made movie for the adventurous film fan.

Contrary to my usual practice I will not provide a plot synopsis, as SUICIDE CLUB is one of those films, where the lesser you know about the story, the more you will enjoy it. It is absolutely unpredictable. As I already said, prepare for a unsatisfactory ending!

Splatter galore in the many suicide scenes makes this one a winner - particularly in the famous scene at the start where 54 girls in their schooluniforms jump in front of an incoming train and a later mass suicide, where dozens of pupils jump down from the rooftop of their school  after a casual chat about the recent suicide fad(which I found an even more impressive scene than the train suicide). Admittedly much of the gore is computer generated, but it is well done. However it is not only the splatter department in which SUICIDE CLUB excels. The whole film is filled with eerie athmosphere and many scenes will have you on the edge of your seat (standout sequence: the policemen stake out the train platforms after a second mass suicide has been anounced.) Particularly unnerving was a juvenile psychopath named Genesis, the type of disturbing but believeable teenage psycho so common in Japanese horror films (if you have seen the ALL NIGHT LONG movies, you will know what I mean). Annoyingly there was also a scene with animal cruelty in the film, which (despite being clearly faked) did not sit well with me.

Actors are convincing in their roles. I also enjoyed the teenie

J-Pop band DESSART - their song ""mail me"" is not only crucial to the suicides and the plot, but it is a great haunting tune as well. I wish the soundtrack for SUICIDE CLUB was available on CD!

To sum it up: SUICIDE CLUB is a great debut film for director Sion SONO (if I remember correctly what I had read on a Japanese film website SONO had done only gay sexfilms prior to SUICIDE CLUB)and while this horror film due to its subject matter involving suicides of teenagers and the offbeat story may not be for everyone, it comes hugely recommended by this reviewer!

Unfortunately there are few extra features on the DVD. There is a picture gallery with only a couple of movie stills and the SUICIDE CLUB trailer, which is great and sells the film well. There are also three other trailers, none of which I found well made or of interest: BETWEEN YOUR LEGS (a Spanish erotic thriller), CHILDREN OF HANNIBAL (which appears to be a gay comedy from Italy) and THE BATHERS (apparently a French erotic film of the arthouse variety).",1147046400,,3036,4.619666048237477

1918309,3,B0000CC885,"Suicide means something different in Japan.  Laking any religious proscription, it has been seen as a valid method of escape from unfavorable circumstances.  Even today, tales of internet suicide pacts are regular news items, with people who never knew each other before gathering to die together, and escape an intolerable existence.  ""The Complete Guide to Suicide"" is a consistent best seller.

Director Sono Shion has attempted to capitalize, exploit and possibly understand this culture of suicide, taking the unusual stance of combining it with modern Japanese youth culture and teen-idol worship.  The all-girl pop group ""Desert"" is an obvious stand-in for ""Morning Musume,"" although Sono has taken their particular brand of harmless bubblegum pop and given them a darker, more destructive edge.

""Suicide Circle"" starts out with a bang, to be sure.  The opening scene is probably 90% of the film's hype, and the first thing everyone mentions when talking about the movie.  All those cheery young girls throwing themselves off the train platform is something that sticks with you.  From there, it becomes a detective story, as Detective Kuroda (former rock star Ishibashi Ryo) hunts for the reason behind the recent suicide epidemic, his only clue being a roll of human flesh, stitched together from pieces willingly cut from the suicides.

Unfortunately, the film falls apart with the introduction of the red-herring character Genesis, played by pop-idol Lolly, who bursts into a non-sequitur  musical video that completely disrupts the established tone and pace.  Perhaps Sono thought it was a bold and innovative digression, but it is one that ultimately fails and ""Suicide Circle"" never quite recovers.

Its too bad, because otherwise this could have been one of the great modern Japanese films.  It is unsettling, atmospheric and ultimately unresolved, as an issue like this must always be.  If you have a skip button on your DVD player, and time it just right, then it will be a very satisfying experience.",1142467200,6,2019,5.246105919003115
1918310,3,B0000CC885,"OK I'm not gonna lie the beginning had me going for a while. You know, the girls comitting suicide and the cops trying to figure out things.

from watching the movie I thought it had something to do with the j-pop group dessert. singning subliminal death messages to the people of tokyo and thats why everybody decided to committ suicide. But the kid on the phone ( clearing his throat) destroyed that idea for me. the plot was weird and throw your curiousity to hell.

also the plot gets confusing...( or dumb)

ok there was these hackers that suppose to find the lead on the suicides, which went to hell because this psycho gang leader ""genesis"" ( lee chalon reject from ""Tekken"")

destroyed their chance.

the detective committed suicide because he couldn't figure out why the dumb kid on the phone was telling him. But the school girl happen to figure things out.

So I was like cool she's going to stop the murders by confronting the j-pop sensation ""Dessert"" I wanted to believe that until she ends up on stage talking to the spoil brats that basically drove the detective guy to suicide.

Then there's this secret room with lil chicks everywhere. ( what's up with that?)

anywho I assumed that was the room where you become a member of the suicide club because this guy with God only knows on his skin. making more skin tape.

The other detective happens to get a hold of it. He found the girl's skin on it. then towards the end when you think she's about to commit suicide she doesn't.

The movie ends with ""Desert"" singing an inspirational song. So I would assume the girl made a difference.

Oh What the hell I can't explain this movie! It was just too weird, or maybe it just sucked deep inside.",1129075200,4,1706,4.5064935064935066
1918311,5,B0000CC885,"In the brash and ghastly opening scene of Jisatsu Curabu (Suicide Club), fifty-four students from eighteen different high schools join hands, step up to the edge of the platform at Shinjuku Station, and jump in front of an oncoming train.  The splatter of blood against the train windows and spray of blood on screaming and horrified onlookers, and blood pouring onto the platform, as well as the chaos at the station sets the stage for this drama on how living in an industrial metropolis like Tokyo robs people of their connection to themselves.

Officer Kuroda, a fifty-ish family man with two children, Sakura and Toru, is in charge of the case.  At first, the majority of his fellow officers, like the bald Murata think it's too much TV.  A cult perhaps?  However, a call from a woman calling herself Koumori (the Bat) reveals something odd and sinister.  Koumori refers Shibu to a website that shows a row of red dots (representing women) and white dots (men), and that 54 red dots appeared on the site, and also before the suicides were reported!  To add to the sordidness, a roll of ten centimeter strips of skin stitched together is found in a white sports bag at the train platform.  Some belong to the dead students, many whose remains body parts are a horrid bloody collage of legs, and uniforms on the autopsy table.  Things are complicated further when another caller says assuredly, that there is no suicide club!

Murata's point that it's too much TV points to how impressionable teens are and how fads come and go quickly.  Two days after the suicides, a group of high schoolers join hands and jump off the roof.  Once someone says ""Let's all kill ourselves,"" and everyone goes ""Yeah!"" it's sad how jaded they seem to be, little realizing that they'll never see each other again.

It's not just teens, but ordinary adults committing suicide, as seen in a series of skits.  Before hanging themselves, four women loudly declaim that ""life is a sin.  You just cause trouble for others.  Kill yourself before you murder someone.""  And a mother in the kitchen slicing some daikon (long turnip) keeps on smiling as she continues slicing her fingers AND the daikon, oblivious to the spray of blood.  All her daughter says is ""Dad, Mom's being funny.""

And just what is the connection with Dessert, a quintet of cute girls (average age 12.5) who sing infectious pop-techno songs like the seemingly harmless ""Mail Me""?  However, it's a crucial line that may send out the wrong message.  They also sing how the world's like a jigsaw puzzle and how somewhere's there's a fit for everyone.  ""Don't fit, you say?  Then make it so. ...There's nowhere for my piece to go.  Find a place that lasts forever.  Perhaps I'd better say goodbye.""

But throughout the carnage, emerges the theme of the disconnect Tokyoites have between their fellow comrades.  A look at the faces on the subway cars yielded tiredness, emptiness, and unhappiness in their eyes.  Indeed, the recurring melancholy instrumental theme reflects weariness at a life without meaning in the industrial waste of Tokyo.

On the phone, Kuroda is asked by a child who has a penchant for clearing his throat:  ""What's your connection to yourself?... If you die, will you lose the connection to yourself?  Even if you die, your connection to your wife will remain.""  It also comes down to the loss of empathy between people:  ""Why couldn't you feel the pain of others as you would your own?  Why couldn't you bear the pain of others as you would your own?  YOU are the criminal.""  Indeed, Kuroda's own two kids, Sakura and Toru, are more addicted to the Net and to TV rather than their own family.

Maybe it's best to be like Mitsuko, the girl on the DVD.  She is shocked, sad, angry, and betrayed when her boyfriend dives off a roof and lands on her, yet musters the courage to say, ""I have to keep living.""  She is sullen, a bit harsh, despises stupid questions, but quite the realist, connected to herself.

Apart from the carnage, there are some disturbing scenes, such as forms writhing in sheets in an abandoned bowling alley, and apart from the message of connection, the point of enjoying life is ultimately revealed, per Dessart:

Scary it's true, but it's loads of fun too

To open up and feel the brand of life

For each and everyone.

Light yourself with life

Light yourself with love

Light yourself with memories

All it takes is just a little heart and courage on your part

As we go, we'll forget the pain

We'll feel life again.",1128816000,51,4508,4.696040868454662

1918313,5,B0000CC885,"Part of a wave of sophisticated, stylish, and very gory horror films that have emerged from Japan since the late-'90s, Suicide Club attempts to merge the ultra-violence of Takashi Miike (Dead or Alive, Audition) with the David Lynch-esque psychological terror of Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Cure, Pulse). It succeeds best on the first count. The gore, of which the graphic splattering of 54 schoolgirls across a train station is just the beginning, is positively stomach-churning, and director Shion Sono effectively conveys a spooky, film noir mood throughout. He does greathowever to turn his film into a statement about pop culture, social conformity, and the media's fixation with violence. He also  injects hearted attempts at humor that miss the mark amid the film's relentless gloom and gore. As a result, it's difficult to tell if Sono is actually  cynically exploiting social issues to add an unnecessary element of sensationalism to an otherwise well-made, a violent, good horror movie",1117152000,4,985,5.348387096774194
1918314,5,B0000CC885,"Shion Sono's ""Suicide Club"" (""Jisatsu Circle"")is Japan's answer to the American subversive smash-hit ""Fight Club"", only this time it's disaffected Tokyo white-collar workers hooking up in basements and industrial sites across Hokkaido, ritually mutilating each other, then committing traditional Japanese hara-kiri (suicide). Too late does our hero realize that, unlike his trans-Pacific colleagues, ""Suicide Club"" isn't going to be a growth industry.

OK, OK, I'm just kidding---that's not what ""Suicide Club"" is about. I just couldn't help myself.

Buy this movie, then go through the house and turn all the lights off. Order some sushi and boil up some hot sake, and ponder this lethal dose of cinematic curare served up in the form of ""Suicide Club"", Shion Sono's night-gaunt cave spelunk into madness, teen-culture, conformity, identity, consumerism, and the unanticipated deadliness of girl-groups.

There's no point in doing a plot crunch of erstwhile Japanese pornographer Shion Sono's mind-warping ""Suicide Club""; like his fellow countryman Takeshi Miike's equally ghoulish and puzzling ""Audition"", the less you know in coming to ""Suicide Club"", the more fun you'll have.

If you want a few bone fragments of what little linear plot the movie offers, though, I'll humor you---and if you're this far, chances are you already know about Suicide Circle's big bloody fishook of an opener: 54 giggling, smiling Tokyo schoolgirls link hands, count to three, and in front of hundreds of shocked and stunned subway commuters, hurl themselves into the path of an oncoming train. One! Two! Three! Wheeeeeeee!

The only things left in the wake of this horror (apart from a flood-tide of blood) are body-parts and a designer shoe-bag, so the police forensic team needs a strainer and plastic baggies to haul the evidence back to the Station.

Now that's what some might call a promising start---I certainly do!---but trust me, it's *nothing* compared to the unbridled tsunami of ghoulish creepiness and pure unadulterated ick that flows once this baby gets rolling.

The party is just getting started: as news of the atrocity on the subway platform filters out through TV and radio, the nation is gripped by a wave of copycat suicides among a wide range of people with no obvious connections. And what is the connection between the spate of suicides and the mind-rippingly awful girl-group ""Desert"" (or Dessert/Desart---the group name inexplicably changes)? Or the link to a website that is evidently tracking the suicides---*before* they occur?

When I first watched the film, I had unwittingly rented the R-rated Blockbuster DVD, which trims the opening bloodbath down to about 10 seconds of ruddy splashing. I soon realized my mistake, but it wasn't the opener that sent me running out of the house to buy my own copy: it's the breathtaking second sequence.

All I'll tell you is that most of the action in this sequence is filmed in almost unbearably long tracking shots of nurses navigating their way through the dark corridors of a nearly empty hospital. The sequence works---it's very subtle and you are convinced there are things happening just out of range of the camera that Sono is teasing you with---the director doesn't want you to see everything, not yet. That sequence alone was so cripplingly spooky that I rushed out and bought myself an unrated copy.

To be honest, when the credits rolled I contemplated returning the thing, perhaps saying it was defective. Having watched the movie in its entirety, I was baffled, confused, frustrated and annoyed. I was quite taken by the visual bravado with which Sono and his trusty DP Kazuto Sato shot the film: it goes in a heartbeat from creepy crawly ick to techno garish and back again. So what was wrong?

Certainly not the acting, which is all competent, surprising given the number of younger actors, and even though we obviously lose something in translation. The great Ryo Ishibashi squints and grumbles his way through another cop role (he also starred as the Police Inspector in the American remake of ""The Grudge"" and played against type as a film producer in Miike's ""Audition"").

Best of all, Sono ratchets up the level of grue and inexplicable vileness: the autopsy sequence calls to mind ""The Thing"", and rest assured you'll never look at a tuna roll in the same way again.

I think my problem with ""Suicide Circle"" is the film's abrupt shift, possibly psychotic shift in tone about 40 minutes in. Initially, I hated this mystifying claptraption; I felt cheated for having bought it---when on Earth, and why, would I ever watch the wretched thing again? If you feel that way after your first viewing, relax---that's normal.

But I've changed my mind. I still hate ""Suicide Circle"", but I'm now convinced that it's a work of diabolical brilliance, and I suspect that Shion Sono has created a kind of cursed masterpiece, a work of viral cinema that infects the mind of the viewer and insidiously replicates long after the credits roll. I say this because, quite frankly, I can't get the infernal thing out of my head, and the more I think about it, the more mesmerized I am by this gory-beautiful little puzzle-box of horrors.

""Suicide Club"" is compulsively unforgettable and intellectually voracious: this is a film that positively squirms, teems, and writhes with ideas.

I can't stop thinking about it. I made the mistake of looking, now I'm forced to watch, even when I close my eyes.

1918315,4,B0000CC885,"Suicide Club (AKA Jisatsu Cirlcle, AKA Jisatsu Club) is more than a movie about the group suicides of Japanese school children (with a couple exceptions of adults), it is about more than murders committed by a gang led by a Charles Manson fanatic, more than people trying to find connections to the suicides, but while we're at it, let's just scratch the surface.

Detective Kuroda (Ryo Ishibashi....seen in films such as Audition) is basically trying to find connections between a recent string of group suicides taking the lives of Japanese school children. After each group suicide, a large roll of human skin is found. None of the school children seem to be of the type to commit suicide. They're all normal kids; happy kids. They even have happy dispositions while in the process of killing themselves. The story branches to ""The Bat"", a girl/computer geek trying to find a connection between the murders (she also finds a website connected to suicides that haven't happened yet, another girl that is trying to connect the suicide of her boyfriend to any other event, and an insane man obsessed with Charles Manson that also breaks into song.

Many people dislike this movie because they find it to be too confusing. They need to look at the whole movie in a symbolic sense. It is actually a movie about religion, about how fads sweep quickly throughout Japan, about families drifting apart, about the dangers of idolizing pop-icons/famous faces too drastically.

While, in one scene, the movie attempts to be a bit too ""artistic"", and some of the special effects are a bit cheesy (example: blood sprays as it would from a Nightmare on Elm St. movie or a kung-fu flick), it does not really detract from the overall greatness of the film.

1918316,4,B0000CC885,"There is no doubt that Suicide Club will leave you haunted, and asking questions about what the plot was about. Shion Sono was more concerned about conveying a message than giving us a plot, and the confusing imagery and lack of connections between characters were part of the puzzle. However, I am still perplexed myself about many things, however, I truly enjoyed this movie.

The gore was great, all those neat little girls in their school uniforms joining hands jumping in front of a subway train. The kid s jumping off buildings had an enormous amount of shock value that kept you watching the movie in awe. The mysterious ""Bat""

person, and the Glam Rock person that came out of nowhere, just to mention a few characters.

It's futile to try to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. Sono's message is about what is happening to our younger generation today with all the pop culture and pressures they have. Trying to find out who you are when you're a teenager is a nightmare, especially today with all our new technology. We have computers, video games with lavish graphics, music videos giving you subliminal messages, and so on. So, these kids are confused, lack identity, and are depressed in this film and if suicide is the thing to do, or the trend it could possibly happen.

This is a dark satire about the vast differences between the older and new generation and lack of communication between them. As far as the film, if you can view it not expecting it to make a whole lot of sense, some of it will eventually make some sense.",1106784000,5,1548,4.5978260869565215

However, no real story ever develops and interest deteriorates ever minute you watch.  There is a lot of time spent on story pieces that are never shown how they fit into the main story line.  My assumption is that this was purposeful done, trying to be intellectual by ""letting the audience interpret for themselves"".  It wasn't ""intellectual"".  The story pieces didn't connect and the story fell apart because of it.

This movie does paint a well-done dark atmosphere in the beginning which I enjoyed.  The skin sewn together was a good effect similar to the stomach in the bag in Se7en.  However, anything that involved blood was done as bad as I've seen anywhere.  Someone off camera throws a bucket of blood on a wall or other surroundings.

I wanted to like it.  It introduced elements that I was interesting in having expanded and explored more.  Then when I was interested, it went nowhere.  All potential.  But all the potential remains unexploited.

In the end, it seems some bubblegum pop girl band is somehow behind it all.  How?  Who know?  Not even the writer, I'm sure.

It's not intellectual.  It's not even quasi-intellectual.  It's downright stupid.  It's a bad movie.

Why, they all appear in Shion Sono's incredibly disturbing and impenetrable film ""Suicide Club."" I'm not the only person who adores these offbeat Japanese horror films: Hollywood loves them so much that studios are scrambling over themselves in a mad dash to buy up remake rights. I'm not so sure, however, that anyone in Tinseltown will knock themselves out trying to bring a new version of Sono's film to American screens. A scary ghost story about a haunted videotape has an appeal to audiences on these shores; a tale about kids taking their own lives in heinous ways as a result of the evils of mass consumerism doesn't. Can you imagine a corporation trying to figure out a way to place their products in a film showing children jumping off the roof of their school? I sure can't. I think it is safe to say that ""Suicide Club"" will remain a singular effort for some time.

Sono's film begins with what is probably one of the most memorable opening sequences in a modern horror film. A group of fifty-four Japanese schoolgirls--wearing those instantly recognizable uniforms--queue up at the edge of a subway track, join hands, and dive in front of a moving train. Oh man, what a mess that makes! The cops, led by Detective Kuroda (Ryo Ishibashi) launch an immediate investigation. Their query takes on decidedly ominous overtones when a white bag left at the scene is found to contain a wheel of stitched together human flesh. Good grief, Charlie Brown! Even my hardened soul recoiled at the sight of so much atrocity so early in a film. My finger strayed to the stop button until I decided to tough it out. Fortunately, the movie can't sustain its memorable opening scenes, and things start calming down significantly. That doesn't mean, however, that ""Suicide Club"" turns into a Disney film. The subway incident soon inspires other youths around the country to come up with grisly ways to take their lives, the worst of which is a scenario involving a bunch of kids jumping off the roof of their very tall school building. Suicide soon becomes the new ""in"" thing, something everyone wants to do. Kuroda and his men can't figure out this nightmare.

Then a mysterious website that appears to keep track of the deaths, and even predicts them beforehand with startling accuracy, comes to the attention of the cops. A hacker named ""The Bat"" soon contacts the police promising to track down the identity of those behind the site, and for the first time it looks like answers explaining the grisly suicides will come to light. Unfortunately, a wacko named Genesis kidnaps The Bat and her friends before she cracks the mystery. This guy and his cohorts live in an abandoned bowling alley where they keep their victims tied up in sheets. Genesis, after singing a song, admits to killing a large number of people. Is he the one behind the suicides and the website? Maybe, but kids keep dying after the authorities apprehend Genesis and his gang. Even Kuroda's family isn't immune to the tragedies sweeping the country. By the time he receives phone calls from a throat clearing kid who asks him cryptic questions about his ""connections"" to his family and others, the whole case seems impossible to solve. The focus of the film then switches to a young lady who finds secret messages hidden in products sold by the girl band Dessert, messages that lead her to a place filled with kids asking the same sort of questions Kuroda failed to answer. It's also filled with dyed baby chicks (?).

No one knows better than I do that ""Suicide Club"" is one strange film. Just when you think you've got a handle on the weirdness, Sono throws in another element that doesn't make sense. By the time the end of the movie rolls around, all sense of logic seems to break down. What exactly is Dessert's role in the unfolding madness? What does the song ""Mail Me"" mean, if anything? What is up with the wheels of skin, the kid clearing his throat, and the baby chicks? I think I can follow a few of these things, mainly that all of the questions about ""connections"" hint at the alienating aspects of pop culture and materialism. There is a sort of ""monkey see, monkey do"" facet of mass consumerism that is potentially life threatening, seen here in the way kids so readily take to the idea of killing themselves because others are doing the same thing. Life and death become mere commodities. I have no idea how that theme ties in with a bunch of kids sitting around applauding the answers to their questions at the end of the film, or the whole baby chick thing. Especially the baby chick thing, which is probably some symbol a Japanese audience would pick up on in a minute. For me, it's mystifying in the extreme.

As arcane as it is, ""Suicide Club"" still entertains. The gore scenes go appropriately over the top, but largely fall away as the movie expresses its social messages. I'm not ashamed at all to say I got a big kick out of Genesis's performance in the bowling alley; his song isn't half bad! Extras on the disc consist of trailers for ""Suicide Club,"" ""Between Your Legs,"" ""Children of Hannibal,"" and ""The Bathers."" Sono's film isn't for everyone, and it holds on tightly to its secrets, but I guarantee you will find something in this picture that will grab your eye.

1918321,5,B0000CC885,"Suicide Club opens with 54 Japanese school girls jumping off a subway platform in front of an oncoming train and just gets better from there.  As a horror fan, I loved this movie for it's disturbing violence and genuine creepiness, but the social commentary and philosophy behind it is equally effective.

The opening scene was mindblowing for obvious reasons.  But what made the movie even better after that was seeing how this effected the rest of society.  If this actually happened, it would probably have an intense effect on everyone in the culture, in ways such as what we see here: it begins a wave of suicides across Tokyo.

At the heart of the story is a group of very young children, who make mysterious phone calls to the police, and ask questions with philosophical ramifications which would seem far beyond the comprehension of their tender years.  While this seems ridiculous, I believe this group is shown as children because they represent truth and purity.  If they had been adults, they would immediately appear to be sinister, and I don't feel that they were.  While they seem connected to the suicides, it becomes clear that this is, in no way, their intention.  The theme they present is that of being ""connected to yourself"" and ""connected to everyone else.""  It is difficult for some people to maintain one connection without severing the other.  How do I assert my individuality without alienating myself from my family, and from society?  How do I take care of everyone around me without conforming to the will of the group?  These are some of the issues the characters in this film are struggling with.

There is a scene later on that asks the age old parent-to-teenager question, ""If all your friends jumped off a building, would you do it, too?"" and answers it with disturbing results.  The idea of being ""connected to yourself"" as an individual is examined here, and in the recurring theme of the J-pop group, Dessart.  When the suicides begin to occur at a more rapid rate, one of the kids in the Japanese Junior Spice Girl group says, ""Everybody's acting funny lately.  We hope this song cheers everyone up!""  Up to this point, I was looking at that little girl and saying to myself, ""Yeah, right!  You hope that song drives everyone to suicide!""  But by the end, I was not so sure.

If we listen to the lyrics of Dessart, what we find is nothing so deep and philosophical, but something to appeal to people who may be lost because they are having trouble maintaining the connections the children are concerned with.  The first song we hear, ""Mail Me,"" says, ""By phone or PC, MAIL ME, you should know as friends go yours is the best hello, MAIL ME, I need to hear from you now, or I'LL DIE.""  This is something that young people would be able to relate to if they were connected to others, but not to themselves.  It is possible to be connected to someone else, but you will still be alright by yourself if you do not hear from that person.  You will not die without communication from someone else.  The inclusion of the J-pop group further illustrates this idea of connections--you can value the ideas of everyone around you without owning a pop group's CD just because ""everyone has one.""  And the theme of suicide, committed because others are doing it--I can have empathy for that person feeling his/her life was not worth living without coming to the conclusion that my own life cannot be worth living.

The philosophy about connections becomes physically manifest in a clue the police keep finding--a chain of rectangular pieces of skin sewn together.  It symbolizes pieces of individuals, all slighly different from each other, literally connected to each other.

At one point, the movie goes off on a tangent into a scene with a serial killer named Genesis, who performs a violent and Rocky Horror-esque musical number.  This awesome, if puzzling, interlude is actually an example of a person who is completely connected to himself, but not to other people.  Genesis has completely asserted his own individuality, but lacks a connection to human kind.  He does what he wants without respecting the lives of others, and so he kills.

As the film progresses, it becomes apparent that the strange goings on do seem to be leading back to the cult of children.  But it doesn't seem to be the children and their message that is causing the suicides, but rather a failure on part of those who speak to them to fully digest the message for themselves.  When they ask, ""If you die, would your connection to your loved one remain?  If yes, then, why are you living?"" they mean to make people understand that their connection to themselves is valuable to their life.  Instead, people come away thinking that there is, in fact, no reason to live, because the connection they have to people would not be severed by their own death.

In the end, Dessart gives a final performance, and says, ""Our final message to you: LIVE AS YOU PLEASE.""  Is Dessart connected to the mysterious children?  The ending would tell you, probably so.  In spite of their best efforts, their message was being corrupted and misinterpreted, and causing people more pain, so the children choose to end their mission.

Director Shion Sono examimes many themes present in Japanese culture, so it will help if you know a little bit about this before viewing Suicide Club.  However, most of what he deals with, peer pressure, conformity, suicide, have universal interest.

There's really bad subtitles, which gives you an idea of what they're trying to say but comes out corny or stupid.  Lots of the scenes in the movies don't make sense and once again comes off as stupid.  There are some disturbingly sick parts, but aren't enough to be gory.  It wasn't scary at all.

And I DO get the message it is trying to send (suicide is bad and has become trendy, like depression and cutting in today's society).

However, the message is conveyed far, far, FAR too subtly for the content matter.

Which is too bad, because this film had some serious potential to be an excellent slap in the face to people who thought suicide was ""powerful"" or ""cool"".

Sure, it's powerful. It has the power to end every possibility in front of you and shatter the lives of every person who cares about you.

And some of the scenarios go a bit too far. I'm a person who LOVES sick, twisted, f-ed up material. I think se7en is one of the best films I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of gory cult cinema, especially sadistic ones. Audition was great, and so was Begotten.

I've even dabbled in so-called ""snuff"" films to see if they were actually real, or just another urban legend. So far, every single one I've seen is fake.

The scenes throughout this film made me feel rather uncomfortable and disgusted for the light attitude towards the content. I had to admit that I did laugh rather loudly when the students landed from the rooftop, and all you see of them landing is an interior shot from the cafeteria where the students are laughing and eating, then suddenly you see a body fly past the window and blood splatter all over the side of the building. Good times, good times...

However, if you're going to do a movie for gratuitous gore, make a horror movie. If it's going to be a satire, make it actually funny.

But do NOT make it as though you're trying to convey a message.

I doubt that this man has had anybody near him commit suicide, or even TALKED to anyone who's known anyone who has.

If it meant something at the end, sure, it would be okay. But it doesn't.

Therefore, I am offended, for the first time in my LIFE, by a movie.

Dammit, people, I think Terror Firmer is hilarious!

But the band that makes those oh-so-popular songs does sing a pretty cool song in the middle of the movie. Too bad the music is obscured by one of the members pointlessly raping and stabbing a girl to death in the same room.

Twisted, yes. Enjoyable, no.

I, myself, am a relatively stable young man.

But when I was watching this movie I realized, ""You know what? I don't really want to kill myself, but if someone handed me a gun and told me to shoot myself, I would just say, 'Eh, why not?' and blow my brains out without any hesitation!""

That is the mood that this movie can put you in, and fails to bring you out of.

All around, a very well-made film.

1918325,2,B0000CC885,"_Suicide Club_ certainly held my attention.  I found myself both shocked and horrified by the casual manner in which suicide is depicted in this film.  Seemingly endless streams of people launch themselves into the unknown; in fact, the opening scene in the underground train station (an actual site of many Japanese suicides) sprays blood all over the scene.  What particularly makes this film casual is the always horrible sub-title job.  For some reason, while this film seems to have some complexity to it, the dialogue is extremely watered down in the text and I just have to think that the actual script is much more complex and interesting.

_Suicide Club_ is a film that seems to explore the darker side of life, Japanese culture, and death without coming to any sense of a resolution.  Many of the characters and sub-plots never tie together and the audience is left with a bunch of dangling fragments, trying to pick up the pieces of this storyline that never seems to go anywhere.  As has been my experience with most Japanese films, one just cannot take their eyes off this material because it is fresh and edgy.  However, as an American film goer, I just can't appreciate the film's depth and complexity without some semblance of continuity and the ability to understand the language first-hand.  Imagine ""Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolfe"" in translation?  It would be awful.  Naturally, this is not really a strike against _Suicide Club_ as it is a foreign film, but I think that English speakers will be hard-pressed to extract the full meaning of this film without the complexity and subtlety that the script may have possessed.",1098576000,24,1643,4.8953068592057765

1918328,3,B0000CC885,"Suicide Club (Shion Sono, 2002)

I'm still trying to figure out whether Suicide Club was insanely brilliant or just plain stupid. I have come to the tentative conclusion it was a combination of the two, but the stupidity probably shouldn't put you off seeing it.

Suicide Club begins with one of the most memorable opening scenes in film: fifty-four smiling, happy Japanese high school girls throwing themselves into the path of an oncoming train. The resulting gore has a Takashi Miike feel to it, which is likely to endear a good number of people to the film from the outset (and send others running away screaming). A team of policemen take an interest in the events, which are part of a rash of suicides around the country, but as there's no crime, it would be difficult to open a criminal investigation.

All of the pieces for a brilliant mystery are here. The police officers-- Kuroda (Audition's Ryo Ishibashi), Murata (Kill Bill's Akaji Maro), and Shibu (Pistol Opera's Masatoshi Nagase, presently starring in an amusing Japanese TV series based on Spillane's Mike Hammer novels)-- are at least marginally more intelligent than the police in most thrillers. There are a good number of intriguing subplots. And the things which have come to be known as ""skinnamon rolls"" are just plain brilliant. The problem is, it doesn't ever cohere. Subplots are either left to fall where they are and never picked up again or continued on a couple of scenes too long, so you think these characters will be important again later in the story, then disappear. Other subplots appear out of nowhere and then disappear as quickly. This gives the whole thing a rather incoherent feel; either the movie was originally twice as long and met with an utterly incompetent editor, or Sono, who also wrote the screenplay, did so under the influence of heavy narcotics, and never got around to filling in the bits on which he blacked out.

This might be marginally forgivable in a first film, but Sono has directed a number of films, so of feature length, over his fifteen-year career. So we're left with the question, what was the man thinking? The lack of coherence here goes well beyond the impressionist feel that makes movies like The Fog (John Carpenter, 1981) and Audition (Takashi Miike, 2000) work so well, and enters The Thin Red Line (Terence Malick, 1998) territory.

What makes it more frustrating is that Sono does make everything cohere in impressionist fashion at the end of the film; we're left with a number of questions, but we think we have a good idea of the answers, and everything gets wrapped up in a semi-satisfactory way. Depending on how you answer those questions, the scene running during the end credits is either a hopeful look to the future or exceptionally chilling. Either way, it's effective. It's the questions that are raised during the first eighty minutes of the film that knock it down a number of notches. ** ",1095984000,3,2931,4.828685258964144
1918329,5,B0000CC885,"Just a comment to someone who previously deeply commented the film (Alexia Komaux). I think the supposedly contradicting sense is not really there.

First of all, we have the ""individuality vs society"" by which people commit suicide in order to fit into society, you are a piece in the puzzle, find where does your belong, as Dessart ironically sings.

However, Kuroda is called ""scum"" for not caring about the others, for just thinking about himself. I see no contradiction here, in the sense that our society is based on greed and personal satisfaction, and a huge self-importance: becoming part of the consensual reality of our society means destroying your individuality, but at the same time, getting involved in a narcissistic way to live...

In democracy, the individual BELIEVES HE IS FREE: democracy insists us we are free at the same time we are taught to perpetuate greedness and narcissism as a basis of our behaviour: thus, the ""egoistic sheep"" can be born.

I think Suicide Club then again goes against these two concepts: first of all it confronts individuality development against society sheep-ness, but at the same time it attacks the ""ego"", which is usually confused with ""personality"", which is also confused with ""individuality"". Personality as we usually know it is just a behavioural option among many others, it is limitating, and it has been created by the desires and frustrations society has thrown upon us, so, ""personality"" is at the same time an enslaver. True individuality needs the destruction of personality & ego, in the sense of breaking the bonds society has tied you with.",1093392000,,1610,5.041353383458647
1918330,5,B0000CC885,"On a purely visceral level I dug it, on a cinematic level I dug it, but on an intellectual level I feel that it falls somewhat short. There's just too much that doesn't add up for me and at times it felt like it was being obtuse for the sake of being obtuse. I wouldn't call it pretentious or smug like some other obtuse movies I've seen (Public Access for one. A movie my friend aptly dubbed ""the cinematic equivalent to blue balls""), but I definitely agree with the person who said that the only way to understand everything would be to crawl into the brain of the Shion Sono.

I got the whole point about the act of suicide being up to the individual, and that it was a choice between being an individual and becoming part of society. The teenagers that jumped off the roof weren't linked to the little kids in rainslickers because there was no sports bag found. Therefore their decision to jump reinforces the idea that society or the group is really the culprit behind everything. Especially when you realize that the last girl to jump was the very first girl to stand on the ledge (I rewound the DVD three times and counted to be positive.) Had the others not joined her on the ledge (peer pressure) perhaps none of them would have jumped.

I could even see that suicide was merely a metaphor for the obliteration of one's identity in order to become part of the group. The girls jump off the tracks, we see one girl's face (her identity) pulverized by the train and then just buckets of blood. Afterwards in the morgue, the ""body"" of the victim that they find is a combination of several bodies mashed together. When the teenagers jump off the roof we see them fall and then, once again, blood. We don't see the bodies afterwards other than the ear, but whose ear is it? And when the girls jump off Osaka Castle it happens off-screen. Once they become part of the group they no longer exist.

Unfortunately, both of those ideas seem to be contradicted several times throughout the movie, so I can't be certain that those theories are valid. In fact, half of the movie seems to directly contradict the other half.

If the whole point of the suicides is to enforce the idea that being an individual is more important than being part of the group, and if the chain of skin is supposed to represent that we are all connected to one another, how do those two ideas co-exist? Why did those who chose to commit suicide and those who didn't commit suicide BOTH have their backs shaved? Wouldn't it have made more sense to have those who chose suicide be the sole donators to the skin chain? Instead of living as an individual they elect to have a big hunk of skin taken off with a plane and commit suicide just so they can belong to the group. Maybe its just me, but that makes a whole hell of a lot more sense then what actually happened in the movie.

Also, IF the message of the film is individuality over faceless society, then why did the second child berate Detective Kuroda for not caring about any of the victims until they were personally connected to him AFTER the first child ""explained"" the whole connection dealy? ""Scum!"" That seemed more of a ""we are all connected and should take care of each other"" message than a ""live for yourself"" message.

If we know that the kids who jump off the roof of the school AREN'T connected to the other suicides because of the lack of the sports bag and its contents, then what about all of the other suicides that ARE linked to Dessert yet have no gym bag? There was no gym bag found at Mitsuko's boyfriend's suicide (since his skin was on one of the other skin chains) nor was there one at Detective Kuroda's house, but obviously both are connected to the original mass suicide.

When the girls jump off of Osaka Castle while the young detective is staring at the website the red dots blink onto the screen AS he gets the phone call telling him about it, not before. So how could this jibe with what The Bat originally tells them about the dots appearing BEFORE the suicides? Especially since the suicides HAD to have happened some time before he got the phone call. Shouldn't those dots appear immediately after the Q&A with the audience of creepy children? That's supposedly when they decide to kill themselves or not, right?

Other scenes just raise questions with no discernable answers or make no sense to me at all. Why did the security guard see the ghosts of the two nurses? Was that scene even necessary? Why didn't the other comedian kill himself too? Did he know his partner was going to knife himself in the throat? He must have, because he didn't even blink while the audience ran out screaming. Why are the little kids wearing yellow rain slickers? Did they get them on sale or something? How come BOTH of the mysterious kids who called the police cleared their throats after every speech, yet NONE of the kids in the audience did? Are there TWO sets of little kids? One group who runs the [...] website and keep baby chicks and another group with post nasal drip who runs the Ruins.com website and keep rabbits, or are the two sites related? Why set up a website that says ""Send this message to stop the suicides"" if you're just going to call the people that sign up and tell them there is no Suicide Club? And what purpose did the other website serve other than being a psychotic score board? Why did three times as many girls/women kill themselves as boys/men? Were there only three sports bags and three skin chains? And if so does that mean that the kids had a set number of people they were going to test? What role do Dessert actually play other than being a key to a riddle? Are they themselves part of this whole thing, or are they being controlled? Do they even exist? We never see them other than on television or in print. What of the arena itself? Is it some mystical place or merely a conduit to the realm where those creepy little kids interrogate J-Pop fans? Why was it Dessert's last performance? Again, does that mean there was a set number of people needed for the skin chains? Oh, and perhaps most importantly, WHO THE HELL ARE THOSE LITTLE KIDS?!?!?!?!

The only thing I feel that I completely understand was the purpose for Genesis and his ""Suicide Club."" A Suicide Club that only kills others and not themselves mind you, reinforcing the notion that there is indeed NO Suicide Club. I don't believe their purpose was for some Rocky Horror homage or sheer shock value. If you watch The Bat and her friend's expressions before they are kidnapped they are practically giddy about the prospect of contacting the people responsible for the suicides. She even signs her BBS post to ""my DEAR Suicide Club"". She went looking for some sort of idealized evil, but instead of getting what she had romanticized about she found true depravity. It's not unlike teenagers in our own culture who worship serial killers or mass murderers because they think it makes them dark and outsiders and therefore cool. Oh and yes, she did die after Genesis and his merry band caught her typing. Think about it. He wants to get caught, but more importantly he wants to be infamous. The higher the body count, the higher the level of infamy. Also think about what happened the FIRST time he told one of his goons to be entertaining.

I really did like this movie a lot despite its many flaws. It's seemingly contradictory metaphors and puzzle pieces that don't quite fit (make them fit! whoo!) I'm sure that a lot of those contradictions and dead-ends exist solely to move along the plot or provide cooler imagery, but that doesn't bother me as much as it probably should. Even now as I write this I'm pondering all those unanswered and unanswerable questions, but not in a bad way. I'm curious rather than frustrated. And even though I wish the film gave more concrete answers, I agree with the person who said that the overall feeling the movie leaves you with is far more important than the solution to the puzzle.

It's not that it wasn't interesting, in fact, it draws you in with a mass suicide right at the beginning, but it goes nowhere from there.  There are glimpses of social satire, such as the disgustingly terrible girl band that seems to make people want to kill themselves, and the fact that cell phones and internet are used to recruit people into the ""Suicide Club,"" which is run by a five year old boy with a bad cough.  There's also lots of talk of having a ""connection to yourself"" which is indirectly touted as a deterrent to suicide.  I also found it significant that there was never any sincere dialogue between the characters...every one seemed very distant from one another.

There's no logic to this movie. It doesn't even come close to being the ""psychlogical thriller"" some claim it to be. Instead it's cheesy and corny--and extremely disturbing.

1918334,5,B0000CC885,"Suicide Club is an explorative Japanese film asking intrinsic questions about societal taboos in relation to individualistic connections.

I found this film both macabre and beautiful in the way it showed characters interacting.  It brought up some excellent points about how loss is felt universally, not just locally, and how the health of one affects the health of another.  These types of explorative films are usually discouraged in American Theaters because we tend to push a culture of ""buy buy buy, don't ask why"".  But this film definitely diverts from American cinema in its ability to ask the gruesome questions that plague human psyche, directly relating to the origins of pain and suffering and how they play out in society.",1089504000,,737,5.116666666666666

It's true -- this movie is gruesome.  But that's not what bothers me.  What I didn't like was how terribly uncomfortable it made me feel by the time it was finished.  I don't mind the blood -- it's a combination of the convoluted plot, the absolutely DREADFUL music, and the inexcuseably bad juxtaposition of the teenie-pop ensemble singing whilst people die.
The plot goes thru plot twists that even David Lynch might enjoy.  I can appreciate an artistic statement with such twists.  But soon they become tiresome and forced.  The Rocky Horror-like interlude was one of the worst things I've ever seen in film.  It's not that it's poorly done.  It's just wholly unpleasant and disgusting.  Exuberant and ugly.
Did I mention that the music in this movie makes my skin crawl?  Between the worthless oft-repeated synth-orchestra melody and the bubblegum pop of Desert (Dessart?  Dessert?), I couldn't wait to go to my stereo and listen to ANYTHING.
I think a lot of people are saying good things about this movie just because it's weird.  They can't follow the story (you're not supposed to be able to) so they think it's some form of high art.  Wrong.  It's just bad.  I dig David Lynch as much as the next guy, but Suicide Club is just plain bad.  Don't read anything into this movie that isn't there.  This is the cinematic equivalent of someone scratching their nails on a chalk board.",1088985600,8,1662,4.665517241379311

That utterly freaked me out. I read the comic which I was inlove with..the movie was a disapointment. The story was hard to follow and stupid. The only reason to watch it is for the really hot chick with glasses calling herself ""The Bat"", who was..wooah. The high points of the movie is when the kids jump off a building and there is an insane flood of blood, which is funny because its impossible, second when the girls boyfriend falls on her head, almost takes off her ear and then she orders a coffee, and third when the sparklie drag queen starts singing an idiot song. Other then the babe in the glasses the only enjoyment I got from this movie, was when my friends sister started freaking out and kept harassing her father about how scared she was about commiting suicide. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't waste your money. Read the manga, it is amazing, this movie doesn't even deserve to have the same title. You may think this spoils the plot, the truth is there was no plot. It was a bunch of over done gore, and bad singing.

1918340,4,B0000CC885,"It was definitely confusing though.  Immediately after finishing the movie I couldn't decide if I liked, or really did NOT like, ""Suicide Club"".  I think much of the criticism stems from this being a Japanese social commentary, which is constructed very differently from American movies.  There's no attempt to tie the loose ends or reason out the actions of the characters, although it's possible that some of the meaning was lost in the translation.  Americans like their movies to make sense within the context of an overall plot.  Making sense was not a top priority in this movie - the commentary was.
The central question is the relationship of self with respect to modern pop society.  Regardless of WHO was doing the killing or HOW they killed, it is the degradation of core values in the face of pop commercialism that is symbolically killing the youth of Japan.  In asking the question ""what is your relationship to yourself"", the older generation could not comprehend the paradox because they could not relate to the pressures and unknowns plaguing the younger generation.  In their quest to understand their relationship to themselves, the younger generation turns not to a stable core society but to pop culture, which in turn kills them (via suicide).
I think the execution of the film would make much more sense to native Japanese, or perhaps they would not be as critical of the plot holes.  The movie does meander, and the subplots are never fully explored or resolved.  And yes, the whole character of Genesis seemed contrived, especially since I had no idea who he was or what he represented.  Didn't like him torturing pets.  Really didn't like his singing.
As for the violence, the movie isn't that gory.  Certainly ""Seven"" was far worse, or for that matter ""Kill Bill"".  In fact the blood scenes weren't done that well,  but the cheerfulness the kids have before their suicides is chilling.
This is a good movie.  The idea of cute Japanese girls slaughtering themselves alone is worth a look, and the social commentary is quite interesting.  Just be prepared to end the moving asking ""But what about...""",1084492800,8,2125,4.891061452513966

1918344,5,B0000CC885,"On the night of May 26th, 54 school girls descended the stairs of Tokyo's Shinjuku Station. While crowds of people gathered together on Track 8, these teens (who came from 18 different schools) stepped behind the platform's yellow line. Suddenly, in an unprecedented act of escapism, all the girls jumped in front of an oncoming train. Amid the screams of terrified and dumbfounded spectators, an ocean of blood splashed on the walls as bodies were crushed under the screeching wheels.
The gruesome spectacle I just described is merely an opener to 2002's ""Suicide Club,"" a mindblowing horror film written and directed by Shion Sono. Mixing a generous helping of gore into a detective mystery, this film warns adults of a growing tragedy noticed through careful observation: a homogenized holocaust of bubblegum consumerism. What makes this movie all the more chilling is how self-destruction has become another innocuous fad embraced by adolescents. With peer pressure in the air, teenagers clap and cheer as their best friends leap off tall buildings and hang themselves to chase the hottest thrill.
In the center of ""Suicide Club"" is a cheerful, all-girl pop group called Dessart. Their latest single, ""Mail Me,"" is topping the charts as manufactured Dessart products are sold to the masses. Meanwhile, the Tokyo police department searches for clues linked to the train suicides. Among the members are Kuroda (Ryo Ishibashi), Shibu (Masatoshi Nagase), and Murata (Akaji Maro). At first, these three gentlemen believed that the deaths were forced upon victims by an underground cult. However, the plot is twisted when Shibu gets a phone call from The Bat (Yoko Kamon), a woman who is intrigued by a rather strange web site. On [...] are rows of red and white dots. Each single dot represents another person's suicide, and more dots appear on the monitor immediately before the deaths happen. Later, it's revealed that at almost every crime scene, a white sports bag is mysteriously left behind. Inside it is an incredibly grisly souvenier: a coiling belt stitched from the victims' skins. Apparantly, every time a person dies, his/her flesh is added to the bleeding band. However, it's never known as to who is actually doing the handiwork.
During the movie's scenes of satire, citizens all over Tokyo take their own lives as part of the morbid entertainment. A heavy stand-up comedian slits his throat. A young girl inserts her head into a gas stove. There's even a moment when a smiling mother methodically slices off her fingers on a cutting board. Here, to truly alarm us, her husband and children never pay attention; they are too busy watching a Dessart commerical in the family den. Obviously, a sinister plot to destroy human life is connected to the Dessart members. It's up to the viewer to decide what that is. Could the group's songs contain subliminal messages intended to brainwash record buyers? Are the five members demonic forces that snatch and swallow desperate souls? Or are the girls just pawns manipulated by outside enemies?
Perhaps the most memorable character in the film can be none other than Genesis (Rolly), a sadistic rock singer with bleach blond hair, eyeliner, and black sequins. As an American viewer, I can best describe him as a volatile mix of David Bowie, Dr. Frankenfurter, and Cecil B. Demented. In the latter half of the film, Genesis kidnaps The Bat and drags her into a bowling alley, where he and his band members rape young women and torture house pets. In an insane effort to gain public notoriety, he labels his group ""The Suicide Club"" and boldly claims to have used the Internet to instigate a blood revolution. From here, it looks like the carnage has ended. But shortly after Genesis's arrest, another 200 red dots show up on the computer! What's important about this particular moment is how it reflects the controversy surrounding rock stars: it reminds us of how such shocking acts (like Ozzy Osbourne and Marilyn Manson) are wrongly blamed for encouraging impressionable teens to kill themselves. In a way, ""Suicide Club"" brings the musical  outcast to life as well as the fashionable trendsetters.
If you desire a cinematic work with stunning images and a daring concept, then I recommend this movie for your collection. No American remake can do justice.",1080086400,4,4313,5.023743016759776

This is when the movie divulges into a meaningless, directionless waste of film. The first half of the movie was building you up, and was actually pretty cool and interesting. With a quick pull of a trigger, the whole plot, character development and movie go into the toilet. I can only assume that this movie was intended to shock, but ends up falling infinitely short.

1918348,5,B0000CC885,"Suicide Club has to be one of the weirdest films I've ever seen! It's great!  I worry that we've gotten too used to Hollywood-style films, where everything has to happen for a reason and all the loose ends get cleared up before the popcorn goes cold and the Coke goes flat.  Suicide Club (Suicide Circle?) is pretty much the antithesis of a matinee flick.  It's disturbing, it's confusing and it has a post-modern ironic streak a Bullet-train long.  It's nearest American comparison would be Blair Witch project, or Final Destination - they too employ the same themes of a malevolent, unknown force messing with the minds of mankind, but this is very definitely a Japanese flick, lots of suspense, lots of intrigue, very little explanation, much like the original Ring(u).
Is there a deeper meaning behind it all?  Did the filmmakers cop out of a neat explanation?  You'll have to watch and make your own mind up - personally I think it's intentionally ambiguous - it's designed to freak you out not knowing what the hell happened; much more unsettling and disturbing that way than having the butler do it.
Some scenes are visually brilliant and memorable - not least of these is the scene in the preview that isn't in the movie, where the fax machine starts spitting hair out?  Fantastic!  The sinister nature of our supposedly benign technology represented here by the Internet and text messages and secret web sites is one that I'm sure will inspire a lot more movie as time goes on.

1918349,2,B0000CC885,"""Wow, oh, wow,"" you think to yourself as 54 Japanese schoolgirls march down the subway stairs. A mass of chaos, they are, some conversing with each other, others talking on the phone, and others yet doing who-knows-what. The group heads down on over to the tracks to wait for the train to come, stepping right behind the yellow line. The sign warning people to stay behind the aformentioned line catches your attention when suddenly, the girls step past the line and join hands in an abrupt show of unity. Swinging their hands, they sing to three.  But you can't hear them past 'two."" The thundering train blocks out all other sound. That is until the they take the fatal jump, and a cacophonous cocktail of crunching bones, tearing flesh, and horrified screams floods your ears.
...and so Suicide Circle begins.
Sadly, as well as it knows how to do that, it doesn't know much else. Following the appalling (but darkly comedic) introduction is a poorly structured narrative about an epidemic of suicides in Japan and the detective who must uncover the link behind them all.
The film tries to intertwine different stories into the central plot but fails miserably. These include the Bat, a seemingly mysterious woman who knows of the titular club, and a girl whose boyfriend takes part in the morbid trend.  The latter actually concludes the story in poorly-tied ending. The main story about the detective isn't even that interesting, focusing only on the age-old dilemma of family or career.
Suicide Circle attempts to throw people off towards the end of the movie, but the twist isn't developed well enough. The ambiguity of the ending could be argued as an artistic decision, but considering that everything else was so ostensible, I would lean towards a bad story.
It tries to be a commentary on today's society's obsession with pop culture, but this aspect seems to have been a complete afterthough. Ironically enough, this film only mindlessly contributes to our modern culture's fascination with the macabre and gory without bringing great insight. It contradicts itself.
The music is alright, but the in-movie pop group Dessert actually churns out some pretty catchy tunes, something that's creepy once you actually realize their significance.
In the end, Suicide Club will probably be remembered for its absurd plot and its gory death scenes, but not much else. Like a speaker who does not prepare his speech, Suicide Club does not bring its point across well, a serious impairment for a movie with such a powerful and important statment to make.

1918350,2,B0000CC885,"The film starts off wonderfully with the infamous multiple train-jumping suicide. It's right there on platform 8, the chuo-sen (I will definitely think odd thoughts next time I catch that one!), the music from Shinjuku station is going, and the very creepy combination of such akarui kids all jumping - why? Something is just wrong, in the air...  This is followed up by some very disturbing scenes of more suicides, all very intriguing, is it murder?  Is it mass hysteria, codes in the pop culture?  Alienation in society itself being sparked by...?
So there are clues, the police get involved, all very good.  Lots of nice dark things to think about, to ponder on.  Some very intriguing and wonderfully horribly disturbing things could be going on...
But they don't. Instead, the plot falls apart (perhaps it jumped).  Things change from a good mystery to... what, exactly? There are some more gory scenes (including a self-mutilation scene that I couldn't bear to look at) but none of it is nearly as disturbing or intriguing as the first part of the film, because nothing is tied together.
I am not someone who demands a neat ending, but the entire genre of the film switches abruptly in the middle.  It's not that the mystery isn't solved, but rather that it's forgotten along the way.  I am also not a regular horror film viewer, but merely shocking gore does not a creepy dark film make.
As someone who came up in Japan I would recommend renting it just for the imagery of the opening parts, particularly if you've ever been there on platform 8 or gone to high school. But I'd probably pass on buying it, as someone who prefers a good story.",1077926400,4,1648,4.678200692041522

But in a society where the youth and the adults are so disjointed that the adults cannot understand the youth, such as through popular music [it seems only the youth can figure out the secret Dessert/Desart messages], the internet, etc., and the youth is so impressionable, destruction follows. The perpetrators of the suicides, such as the child who calls the police, they are the innocents who have not been destroyed by that very society, but unforunately, they seem to feel compelled to save their generation by destroying those that are already too late. Society wants to find a scapegoat, which is why there is that self-proclaimed Charles Manson, but it simply does not work that way. The suicides do not stop. If it were simply a shallow mystery with the suicides caused by the pop music group, then it would be nothing more than a B movie. It seems to begin this way, but diverts into a greater meaning. There is humor where you don't want it, and odd suspense. It is not something you forget.",1077062400,4,1211,4.663551401869159
7998866,4,B0000CC885,"Fifty four school girls held hands and jumped in front of a train in Tokyo, drenching everything around with blood and gore and shocking all of Japan. Shortly after, two nurses jump out of a hospital window to their deaths with absolutely no warning. As the amount suicides climb, the police investigate the baffling case. The only clue tying the incidences together is a coil made of strips of human skin, only a few belonging to the dead. What is causing people to kill themselves?

Suicide Club has a shocking, bizarre premise with many different threads making the whole story that occurs over only six days. The police are investigating the suicides headed by Detective Kuroda. Right at the beginning, Kuroda seems like the main protagonist, a seasoned cop working as hard as he can to solve the case. His family is normal with loving moments, bickering, and sullen teens. He doesn't turn out to be the main character. Mitsuko, a young woman almost killed by her boyfriend's suicide fall, plays a much more significant role when she finds clues in her boyfriend's apartment. I love this misdirection because Mitsuko doesn't have expertise and accomplishes more than the entire police force. It also derails the film from its police procedural formula to something else.

The most striking scenes of the film are the suicide scenes. The vast majority of them are done by fairly cheerful people or accompanied by the music of Dessert, a fictional children's pop group. Their music is vapid, cheerful, and people of all ages enjoy it. From the very first blood soaked train scene to a housewife smiling while chopping off her own fingers, these grisly scenes are burned into my brain because of the chilling duality and how each situation varies from the next. Other memorable scenes are obliquely related to the plot such as the glam rock gang headed by Genesis that wants to accept blame for the Suicide Circle. They end up being an odd, musical red herring.

Although Suicide Club is a different film that doesn't follow genre tropes, it's a bit of a mess. The film seems to be pointing to pop music or the internet as sources for the mysterious rash of suicides. However, the ending has more style over substance. There are no real answers which I don't mind, but the bigger questions being asked don't really resonate. It seems to be weird for the sake of being weird rather than connecting to the story. Also, all of the small threads felt more like a series of vignettes in the same world rather than a cohesive story. Overall, Suicide Club is a memorable film that started my love and interest in Japanese horror films. It's definitely dated and has flaws.

The first few minutes are absolutely amazing (and disturbingly bloody).  The rest of the film is fascinating and very, very Japanese.  To understand it to the extent it is understandable at all, it helps to know that Tokyo in the 21st Century is characterized by an intense trendiness and a marked superficiality. (I have spent considerable time in Tokyo since 2001).  The city is so large and crowded that it has become somewhat dehumanizing and one response to this dehumanization and the societal alienation caused by the reduced pleasant interactions and increased social friction that is part and parcel of brutal commutes, little or no neighbor contact (it is not uncommon for Tokyo residents to know almost no one in their apartment buildings, for example) and the stresses caused by a perpetually stagnant economy is to build up a buffer in the form of a false-identity presented for public consumption.  Suicide Club addresses this aspect of modern Tokyo life and depicts the ultimate extension of it while asking a question that even many non-Japanese will relate to: ""How are you connected to yourself.""  The film shows differing responses to this question, from people following pop-culture fads to the point of doing themselves intense physical harm on one hand, and a couple of characters who simply refuse to subsume their personal identity beneath a shallow, pop-culture driven faade.  The story may seem bizarre, unintelligible or even funny at odd moments, but the overall effect is a film about which you will think for quite a long time after watching it.  This would have been a 5-star review were it not for the bowling alley scene which I found both silly and unnecessary.  Still, this is a minor gripe.

Do not expect to be scared with jump scenes or left in suspense. Be prepared to feel disgusted and violated for days afterwards instead.",1456704000,,450,4.6375
