8079657,5,B000ASAU2A,Great work out video!,1424563200,,21,4.5
8079658,5,B000ASAU2A,"I have not been able to try this workout yet, but I looked at it all the way through and I think I'm going to love it and get many benefits from it.",1373068800,,148,3.515151515151515
8079659,5,B000ASAU2A,"For a beginner workout this is pretty effective and yet not overly challenging for those days when you ache a little already, you don't have to put it off. This workout actually would work well for up to 70-80s as well, as long as you are relatively active.",1360713600,3,257,4.375
8079660,5,B000ASAU2A,"The thing I like most about these workouts is that they are not too challenging but they are super effective.  I have tougher workouts for those days when I'm feeling like a challenge but I can always do these, even if I'm not feeling so energetic.  They leave you well excercised but not in agony.",1360713600,,298,4.4
8079661,4,B000ASAU2A,"I thought this video was a very doable beginner Pilates workout. My only hesitation in recommending it would be that the two instructors look as though they've had extensive plastic surgery in acquiring their perfect bodies.  So, much as we'd all like to look like them as we're doing our exercises, unless we've laid out the cash for the breast implants, liposuction, and tummy tucks, I don't know if we have much of a chance.
  I gave it 4 stars for Janice's instruction by the way. You can tell she does this for a living and genuinely wants you to succeed.  Eloise is (surprise, surprise) a former Playboy model and the wife of billionaire, John Paul Dejoria (of Paul Mitchell hair products), who probably paid for the production of the 4 videos because he or she, plugs in their own little Paul Mitchell ad at the end of the DVD.
They do have a nice mansion though, and it is nice seeing how the other 2% of the country lives.",1315958400,5,931,4.458823529411765
8079662,2,B000ASAU2A,"I liked their beginner DVD.  This intermediate is not for me.
It starts with arm exercises using a small ball which I'm guessing
is a weighted ball.  Mostly just swinging it from the front to the side/back.
Very boring.  The floor work was too difficult and hard on the wrists.",1307923200,,277,4.5
8079663,5,B000ASAU2A,"I found the DVD in the library. I did the exercises with it many times before purchasing it. I love Pilates, but it is easy to hurt myself, in some way with many or the Pilates DVDs. And many are just too difficult for me. Fit @ 40 Plus Beginner is easy enough to enjoy. The 40 minutes or so goes by quickly, and I feel great. I like to do it rather than dread it. The women, Eloise and Janice, are beautiful and gracious. The workout is done in 4 segments. There is a set of standing exercises; then they are repeated. Then the floor exercise set, and they are repeated. Then several more exercises at the end. They strengthen the core and improve posture. Really good!",1293580800,,670,4.2421875
8079664,5,B000ASAU2A,This is a good workout for older individuals who are learning Pilates. All the movements are easy to learn and some of more challenging. It is a great way to do your workout at home.,1247184000,6,182,4.228571428571429
