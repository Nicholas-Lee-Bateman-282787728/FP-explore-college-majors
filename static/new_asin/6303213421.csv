The plot is so generic and unoriginal, it's hilarious. The songs are silly, yet don't have effort. Even Splinter looks horrifyingly funny. There are a lot of flaws in this special, it's so stupid in a funny way. The ending after the end credits with the turtles sound a lot like a typical family argument, Overall, if you're a big TMNT fan or if you want to punish yourself with awkward holiday entertainment with bad animatronics, then this is for you.",1449532800,,590,4.5233644859813085
7840920,5,6303213421,"This is awesome. I will say this: it might be meant for children, but they wouldn't like it. Adults hate it too. This is meant for 15 year boys who have a sense of humor. Believe me, it know from first hand experience. From the ""Wrap Rap"" to ""Gotta Get a Gift,"" this is a load of garbage. But it is catchy. It's like a fresh turd that you can't help but take a big ol' whiff of. It's that movie that you didn't know you wanted, kind of like taking a dump. At first, you don't want to take that dump, but when you finally pinch off that loaf, it feels like a stream of heaven flowing out of your backside. So buy, watch, and see what literally no one is talking about these days. It's a magical experience that you probably won't like. But just remember, it's meant for a different age group. And one more thing, it's on VHS. Kids these days don't even know what that is. But I know what it is. And isn't that the true meaning of Christmas? #Yolo #Swag",1418342400,,951,4.090909090909091

7840922,1,6303213421,"My VHS came quickly, and I was SO excited to watch ninja turtles sing christmas songs. however, I put it in my VCR and it doesn't even work. i didn't even get to see it once.",1407801600,,174,3.861111111111111
7840923,4,6303213421,"This video is pretty fun, albeit extremely cheesy.  The video appears to have been pushed out in as cheap a fashion as possible while still being able to officially call itself a Ninja Turtle video.  The costumes are bad and immobile (the turtles all have this creepy smile stuck to their face through the whole video), the music is just Christmas songs changed to include words like ""pepperoni"" and ""Bebop and Rocksteady.""  Despite all that, the video is fun to watch if you're a nostalgic person and don't take it too seriously.",1400284800,,530,4.739130434782608

7840925,3,6303213421,"I don't see how kids could even like this kind of stuff, but I guess even the turtles had to get in on the christmas spirit. The TMNT should stick to eating pizza and fighting crime because rappin' ain't their thang!",1093824000,,216,4.2926829268292686
