8383128,5,B002WHIYXY,"Given the fact that Agalloch has an enigmatic and sometimes elusive discography, I wasn't sure what to expect when I discovered they had released a DVD a few years ago.  After finding a track list, I decided that I needed to get a copy, if only to satisfy my curiosity.  In a short time, I've grown to love this band's music, and I wanted to see them play.  I'm not much into watching concerts on Youtube, so, after a bit of searching, I went for the DVD.  And after watching the show and the special features in their entirety, I'm very happy that I did.

The video quality and sound are better than I expected.  The vocals could be a bit louder, but I usually have that thought about most live recordings and shows I go to.  The band plays each song flawlessly, with a focus on Ashes Against the Grain, which was their most recent full-length at that point.  Here's the track list:

Limbs
Falling Snow
As Embers Dress the Sky
Dead Winter Days
I Am the Wooden Doors
In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion
Not Unlike the Waves
Bloodbirds

The show runs about an hour and ten minutes, and is presented in black and white.  After Haughm lights some incense at the concert's beginning, the smoky haze and black and white format create the perfect aesthetic for their sound and imagery.  Whether you think of Agalloch as black metal, grey metal, or folk metal, the look of the show perfectly matches their artistic vision as a band.

As I've mentioned, they do an excellent job recreating the music heard on their studio albums.  It all sounds stunningly close to their recorded output, with the one exception where they re-worked an entire section of ""In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion.""  The band takes the mellow, clean section in the song's second half and turns it into an up-tempo rock section with distorted guitars and black metal vocals.  I would've been just fine hearing it the original way, but this version sounds great in its own right.

In addition to the concert, there's a 30-minute set of interview clips explaining the formation of the band and their development over the first few albums and EP's.  This is not an easy DVD to find at what most would consider a reasonable price, but if you like Agalloch, and you find one for a price you're willing to pay, I'd recommend getting it.  Like some of their more obscure titles, it goes for a premium no matter where you find it, but sometimes you can get lucky and grab one a little lower than usual.  It's a fantastic release that's entirely worth some effort to find.",1356825600,7,2530,4.506578947368421
