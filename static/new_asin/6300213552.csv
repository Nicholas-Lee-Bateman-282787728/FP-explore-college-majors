7805108,4,6300213552,"This is the strangest and most atypical of classic Trek episodes. Neither Kirk nor Spock is the problem-solver. Their bodies are borrowed by advanced beings whose minds have been trapped inside crystal balls for half a million years. Understandably they are eager to get out of those balls and into bodies. In addition, guest-star Dianar Muldar lets her body be borrowed by a female alien, making three (Kirk, Spock, Muldar). The ending, in which two of the aliens depart, leaving Kirk and Muldar in a passionate embrace, is as ""cute"" an ending as you ever see. The joke is that this time, Kirk got the girl without even being inside his body!

Kirk's conscious contribution to the episode (that is, as Kirk) ends about half way through, when he gives the memorable ""Risk is our business"" speech. I tried to recall what it was like to hear this in the 1960s (I was a small child) and I think it was exciting... The space program was underway, everything seemed possible, and nothing else remotely like Trek was on the air.

The second half is fun, because the alien who gets to inhabit Spock is the bad guy, and Nimoy gets one of his rare opportunities to play a different (and very non-Spocky) personality. Spock's Satanic appearance is normally ironic, but here it's appropriate, because the alien inhabiting him is in this case so deliciously evil. It's evident that Nimoy, at least, is having fun.

There is possibly unintended Biblical resonance. The three aliens symbolically replay the Garden of Eden story, with Hennock (Spock) as Satan, Thalasia (Muldar's character) as Eve, and Sargon (Kirk) as both Adam and God. Sargon is also a Christ figure, for he ""incarnates"" as a human (Kirk) and later sacrifices himself for the good of the human race. (Remember that ""kirk"" is Old English for ""church."") In effect, Shatner finally gets to play God. Make of it what you will.

Of note: Dianar Muldar also appeared in a third-season episode as a different character, but personally I find her far more fetching in this episodes where she wears the mini-skirt Federation outfit. (Yes, this is sexist, but the occasional non-PC quality of the original series is at times refreshing.) Also, the echoing effect used to enhance Sargon's voice whenever he is talking -- either as a disemodied voice (done by James Doohan) or as Kirk -- is extremely cheesy. But it was probably necessary, or else Sargon's disembodied voice would've been even stranger.",1183766400,,2446,4.858513189448441
7805109,5,6300213552,"I remember that line from this episode. Too bad the producers didn't use that catch phrase to promote the latest Trek movie.  I can't remember such an unusual episode in a long time.
The best part of this episode is hearing James ""Scotty"" Doohan as the voice of Sargon.  He's the evil alien entity who is left from a long dead civilization that makes us look primitive.  It wasn't until I read the back of the cassette box that I discovered that Doohan voiced the ominous Sargon.  Diana Muldaur; who portrayed Dr. Pulaski on Next Generation, plays Dr. Ann Mulhall.  She was mysteriously assigned by Sargon who attempts to steal the bodies of Kirk, Spock and Mulhall.  I know that Mulhall's name was not created by coincidence.
It has a little excitement.  The scenes with a Sargon influenced Spock show an emotional side to Nimoy we hardly get to see.  His alien counterpart is in love with the Mulhall.  The takes with the artificial android bodies these other worldly beings were to inhabit were creepy by 1960s standards.  The makeup artists had these flesh color duplicates of human bodies.... when activated would carry the mind of the aliens indefinitely.  The sets were simple and very Outer Limits like in design.  I wonder if Muldaur ever thought she'd be working on Star Trek again almost two decades later?  This is one that can stand repeated viewing.",1017532800,3,1363,4.748936170212766
