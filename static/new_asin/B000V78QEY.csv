8348725,2,B000V78QEY,"This is a great band, but this DVD has poor sound and video quality (you'd think they'd have gotten a feed from the soundboard) and does NOT have chapters. It's just one long track, so if you want to hear a song that's near the end of the set, you either have to fast forward through or watch the whole thing. And of course, you'll have to write down your own track listing because it's not anywhere on the box or disc.
The price is cheap, but not as cheap as the production quality, especially when you compare with DVDs out for other bands.
Only buy it if you're a die-hard fan, but if you are, chances are you have bootlegs that are better quality - and free.",1199232000,5,662,4.1796875
