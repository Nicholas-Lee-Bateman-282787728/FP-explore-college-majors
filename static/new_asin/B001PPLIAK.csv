8334247,5,B001PPLIAK,"I saw this on you tube and had to get it asap.  Even inspite of all the squabbling we do between democrats, republicans, tea party and independents, this country is better than all the others.  Remember 9/11, when the terriorists were going to tear out country apart. Everyone went out and purchased American flags. We put them on our homes windows cars and everywhere else we could think of.  This unified us. Be sure to see/hear what John Wayne said about the Pledge of Allegiance and our country.  You will be buying a new American Flag!!",1342742400,,541,4.604166666666667
