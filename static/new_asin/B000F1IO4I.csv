It's not for everyone, but if you like dark comedy and Neil Patrick Harris, you will really like this movie.",1221436800,,189,4.277777777777778
8116319,1,B000F1IO4I,"This is extreme nastiness masquerading as comedy.
I like gothic horror quite a bit
and this film could have worked well as such.

The plot has an excellent pedigree as it was
conceived by Edgar Allen Poe.

Presented as a comedy, it totally fails.
Is there something funny about slow and painful death,
spousal abuse, suicide, lust, incest and the endurence
of an evil spirit.

It is saturated with toilet humor from which
a pre-teen might obtain some guilty pleasure.

The comical character of the mesmerist was well done.
A wasted performance.

If you laughed during this movie,
you might consider seeking out spiritual direction.

If you laughed at the ending and end credits song,
you might consider turning yourself in
to the civil authorities as a public service.

This might have made a great horror film.
As a comedy, it is vile trash and to be avoided.",1206662400,2,860,4.77027027027027
8116320,5,B000F1IO4I,"This little movie caught me off guard and had me rolling in the floor with laughter. Howard Hesseman(Head Of The Class, WKRP) is a riot as a father who is just a little past Attila The Hun and he rules over his daughter with a ruthless hand. He is about to die and as his daughter arrives with boyfriend in tow(Neil Patrick Harris), he swears in no small measure that he will never let Neil have his little girl. Enter the quack of the title who plans to hypnotize the old boy so that his last moments are pain free. Problems is he dies while he is still in the trance and things become very strange after that.
  The comedy of horrors is very well made and the cast is great, but make no mistake Harris and Hesseman are the show here as they square off over the girl. Hessemans final threat to Harris and Harris' ""prayer"" for Hesseman are side spliting fun and will have you backing up to hear them more than once.
  Very much worth your time and sure to make you smile.",1184716800,7,971,4.204301075268817
8116321,2,B000F1IO4I,"This movie kind off caught me off guard. It wasn't terrible but in some ways predictable. Take for instance the end which related to the Skeleton Key (2005). I would only advise watching this if someone is really board and has nothing to do. Overall, this thriller comedy was better than I expected and I had some laughs which is more than I can say for the other straight-to-DVD thriller comedies like Dead & Breakfast.",1153008000,,420,4.613333333333333
