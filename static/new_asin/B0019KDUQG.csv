8274283,3,B0019KDUQG,For the money I was expecting more. The info that is there is good and I suppose it would cost a small fortune to get it from Nick in person. It would have been improved by more time on Nick than and edit down the Williams sisters. Interesting point is that this DVD has been around for awhile so when I mentioned it to a pro he knew exactly what drills I wanted to work on. The drills are the best part.,1420156800,,404,3.9390243902439024
8274284,4,B0019KDUQG,"This is a good reminder of how to hit
the best shots at the right time. Nick is
clear in his explanations. I just wish
it was a little longer to go into more
depth.",1401667200,,164,3.7142857142857144
8274285,5,B0019KDUQG,This is a great DVD for if you're starting your game and want to understand strategy more. It's at a very basic level and it's very interesting.,1376870400,,144,4.37037037037037
