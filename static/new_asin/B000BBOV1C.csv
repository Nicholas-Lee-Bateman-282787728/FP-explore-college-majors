8271191,3,B000BBOV1C,"First the DVD's programming to the title/menu is non operational. Second the movie Kung Fu Arts is stupid whereas a monkey/chimp is posed to marry a princess by saving her from a poison dart. This stars Carter Wong, he must have really needed the work. The second movie was hard to open, However once started from opening the chapters, it was okay (4 stars).",1475625600,,358,4.609375
