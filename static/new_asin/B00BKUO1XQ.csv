8570038,3,B00BKUO1XQ,"First off there is no one named Mara in the film. That comes from a Swedish legend about nightmares. There is a big build up about dream worlds becoming real. After that we see Jenny (Angelica Jansson) covered with blood telling both her life story and what happened that weekend to an investigator. As a youth Jenny had witnessed her mother stab her father...about 54 times give or take. Mom got locked up. Jenny is just now returning to the scene of the crime as therapy, plus also it is going to be her home once again...maybe.

Most of the film is consumed with Jenny chasing things that go bump in the night with English subtitles.

The film is Swedish. It attempts to create a dream reality and incorporate into a horror story. For me the horror wasn't there as there was nothing going bump in the night to be scared of. It isn't until the end that things tie together, get untied, and then retied. It was cute, but not overly clever. Angelica Jansson was sweet in her role. Makes for a possible rental for those who don't mind the subtitles.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity (Angelica Jansson, Emelie Frantz Nilsson) Blood, but not much visible horror action. More of a Psycho style thriller.",1395964800,,1198,4.588785046728972
