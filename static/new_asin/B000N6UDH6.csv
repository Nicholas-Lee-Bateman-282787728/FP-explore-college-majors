8325453,5,B000N6UDH6,"I hesitated a long time before purchasing the copy of the DVD because of the other poor review.  I don't know if they just got a poor copy, if my copy was better than their copy, or if my standards are lower that theirs.  I am happy I purchased this DVD.  I also have other titles in the Virtual Relaxation series and I just don't perceive a big difference.",1394668800,2,357,4.144927536231884
8325454,1,B000N6UDH6,This DVD was the same company as one we already own for our office and when this one and the TropicalJungle came they are both of terrible picture quality.  They are blurry and completely out of focus.  We can't even use them in our waiting room.  Such a disappointment!,1350864000,,270,4.469387755102041
