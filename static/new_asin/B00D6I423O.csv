8589954,5,B00D6I423O,"You need either the ""fanny lifter"" or the ""transfirmer"" from The Firm workout series BSS1, BSS2, or BSS4 to do this workout. If you enjoyed the workouts from those series, then you will love this one, especially if you're an Allie fan. It's all cardio, and it will make you sweat! Note to music sticklers like me: It gets under my skin when the instructor is off the beat of the music, and there ARE a few minutes when that happens in this one--it's as if she's afraid that she's behind, so she speeds up just enough to get a tiny bit ahead of the beat. However, it only happens during one song, and then the rest is fine, so it's not a big deal. Allie's energy is infectious, and even though I'm not primarily a cardio fan, I actually look forward to doing this one!",1501632000,,767,4.260273972602739
8589955,5,B00D6I423O,This is a surprisingly great workout.  There are a lot of new moves using the firm step that keeps it interesting and challenging.  By the end of the workout I was sweating buckets.  The ab section was also great!  Highly recommend this workout.,1455667200,,245,4.627906976744186

Estimated delivery was January 5th-20th and i received it January 4th. Haven't done this workout yet, but knowing the Firm I'm sure it will be a great workout.",1451865600,,325,4.821428571428571

8589959,4,B00D6I423O,"This is a fun workout. Allie is a great instructor and the music is good. It is a challenging workout as it uses the lower portion of the step for most of the workout. Great ab section at the end; I was sweating! Especially after the section where she uses both boxes, but I like this workout very much, and would recommend!",1379030400,5,324,4.241935483870968
