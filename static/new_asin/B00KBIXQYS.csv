Though known mostly for its frequent inclusion of nudity and sex, it's so much more than that.  One of my favorite shows ever.",1456790400,,449,4.743589743589744

6413641,5,B00KBIXQYS,"Binge-watched the entire 7-season series, using Netflix, in less than a week!
Because I loved it so much, I bought the Complete Series of ""Californication"" from Amazon, and am now ""binge-watching"" all 7 seasons--again!
It's that good!
In the very first scene of the first episode of Season 1, ""Hank Moody"" (David Duchovny) walks into a church, approaches the huge statue of Jesus hanging from the wall, and says he wants to talk!
As he starts to tell JC his woeful tale, a Nun in full Habit approaches and offers to help.
Moody hesitates.
Then the Nun says she'll do oral sex on him to help him through his writer's block!

It only gets funnier from there!
Hank is in love--deeply--with Karen (Natascha McElhone), who he used to live with in New York in unwedded bliss, where they conceived
Becca (Madeleine Martin), before moving to Venice CA, where Hank is managed by longtime friend Charlie (Evan Handler), who's married to the scrumptious little sex freak Marcy!
Hank wants to get back with Karen so bad, but he always screws things up--literally!--just when it seems his greatest wish is coming true!
One big problem happens when Karen's new beau Bill's daughter (Mia, played by Madeline Zima) winds up in Hank's bed--at age 16!--by mistake.
Hank thought she was older!
Becca is really my favorite character.
When the show began--in 2007--she was supposed to be 12 years old.
But she showed the wisdom of someone twice her age!
And, on a personal note, I recently fell in love (figuratively speaking!) with the Australian singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett.
Magnificent talent!  (Read my review of her CD on Amazon!)
But what struck me when I first saw Becca was---she looks EXACTLY like Courtney Barnett!!
(And Becca, in the show, is a rock guitarist and singer, like Ms Barnett!)
Every episode (12 per season, each about 25 to 30 minutes long) produces Laugh Out Loud moments, some so uproarious, I had to go back and re-watch the past 5 minutes again!
Yet the show has some very tender poignant moments too.
And several of those come when father and daughter are alone together!
A STRONG warning to those with delicate prudish souls--there's an ENDLESS array of cuss words---and I mean ones even your biker buddy never uses, as well as tons of nudity, fairly graphic (though not porn!) sex scenes, and frequent use of drugs, mainly marijuana and cocaine!
If you can handle all that, then you'll be loving this hippest & coolest of all shows!
And the selection of songs that are played throughout, and at each episode's end, fits the show like a glove!
The DVD set (the one I now happily own!) is great, works perfectly, and has 2 discs (with 6 episodes on each disc) per season, so there's 14 discs!.
Not much in extras, but every episode offers Closed Captioning which is easy to read!
If I could add a few stars to this show, I would!
In its day, ""I Love Lucy"" broke some walls down.
So did ""All in the Family"" and ""NYPD Blue"" in their eras.
For the years from 2007 through 2014 (The show skipped 2010 for some reason!), ""Californication"" raised the bar again!
(BTW, the show's name PERFECTLY describes the show!!  LOL)",1452211200,3,3129,4.727106227106227
6413642,3,B00KBIXQYS,"Very pissed with Amazon right now, I bought this a few weeks back for me and my dad. I've loved it so far. Until now.

Thanks again amazon.",1442880000,7,395,4.36986301369863
6413648,5,B00KBIXQYS,"What a brilliant series! I had only ever seen David Duchovny as Mulder in The X Files, did not know if he could do comedy--- and I was pleased to discover that his Hank Moody is appealing, nuanced, and funny. He is a self-proclaimed sex addict, impulsive, sometimes self-destructive, a terrible role model for his kid, and makes bad decisions more often than not, and yet you will still find yourself rooting for him. The writing is smart, the acting all good....supporting characters Charlie (Evan Handler) and Marcy (Pamela Adlon) are HILARIOUS. Comic genius, they pretty nearly steal the show. Natascha McElhone as Karen, Hank's on-again, off-again love and the mother of his teen daughter, is low-key and believable, putting up with endless antics from Hank (I'm sure part of her role is to stand around looking utterly stunning, which she does ALL the time, so that you wonder how Hank could ever want anyone else). I found Madeleine Martin, as teen daughter Becca, a bit grating, and I'm not sure if it was the acting or the direction. She has a bit of a goth thing going on, and apparently someone decided that a goth girl with a disappointingly unreliable dad must necessarily talk in monotone all the time. It doesn't work, especially with her voice. (anyone recall that cartoon dog Droopy from the 1950s/60s?} Fortunately there is less of this in the later seasons as Becca matures. Stephen Tobolowsky as Stu is very very funny, you'll recognize him as a character actor from other TV shows/movies.

As the title indicates, this show has LOTS of sex....some romantic, some raunchy, some with more than one partner and some with fewer, and there's plenty of very frank discussion of all things sexual, and vulgar language with it. But it's not just naughty for its own sake, it is part of the story and is often quite funny. Still this is not appropriate even for many teens, you'll want to check it out first before letting your 17-yr-old watch.

Highly recommended binge-watcher's dream!",1439337600,4,1998,4.8391812865497075
6413649,1,B00KBIXQYS,"Season six was missing a DVD but since each season was individually wrapped, I didn't find out until after the return policy has expired. Too bad since I love this series!",1437955200,5,171,4.548387096774194
8657357,4,B00KBIXQYS,"Amidst the farrago of craziness, incoherence and illogic that comprised the Weltanschauung of Californication was the centering charisma of David Duchovny. His sleepy aplomb, somnambulist sangfroid, and laissez-faire attitude about seemingly everything, from L.A.'s Cloud Cuckoo Land to car-jacking and boudoir urination, gave Californication through eighty-four episodes a kind of odd gravitas. The show's deep incoherence was one of its hallmarks: the stories are steeped in contemporary morality and sexual liberation while struggling, as with Freud's return of the repressed, with anxiety and angst over supposedly antiquated moral conceptions of infidelity and profligacy. For example, the institution of marriage, increasingly for many either an irrelevant social custom or an expedient revenue source, was considered by Duchovny's dissolute Hollywood Writer, Hank Moody, as the laudable social framework for cementing a relationship. Marriage was the very thing Hank was too dumb to embrace while he was with his girlfriend, the Karen of Natasha McHelhone, with whom he sired an ""illegitimate"" daughter, the Becca of Madeleine Martin. Sex is the leitmotif of Californication, of course, although its music is usually raucous, cacophonous, and ear-wilting, whether Hank is getting socked in the schnozzle by an underage one-night-stand or a mnage  trois devolves into a scene of risible bed-wetting. Californication has been called a Red Shoes Diary for the Soul, but I am far more partial to Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Red Shoes. Nevertheless, Duchovny's hang-dog persona and, at times, ability to evoke genuine pathos, again shows off this actor's undeniable brilliance and technical control as a performer. (Perhaps not surprisingly, Duchovny married another gifted thespian, Tea Leoni, whose extraordinary verbal/physical post-Lucille Ball talents were amply demonstrated in her too-short-lived show, The Naked Truth.) The polish of Californication is of course considerable, with fine acting throughout, and in addition to Duchovny we have the astonishing Pamela Adlon, whose exquisitely brusque and acerbic Marcy Runkle never fails to delight and make one wish for a special ""Marcy Reel"" as a DVD extra. Can we take the soap opera shenanigans and hijinks of Californication over eighty-four episodes? I think so in that we have been able to take Archie, Betty, and Veronica at Riverdale High since the 1940s, although if Archie had been getting as much sex as Hank Moody, by now his carrot top would have turned to snow. And while Duchovny's Hank Moody is, as conceived by show-creator Tom (Dawson's Creek) Kapinos, of course a clichThe X-Files' Fox Mulder blended with the generic ""East-Coast-scribe-on-the-skids"" F. Scott Fitzgerald trope, which the Coen Brothers satirized in Barton Finkthe show usually works because of Duchovny's laid back response to almost any craziness, and the excellence of the supporting cast. Importantly, Californication demonstrates, wittingly or unwittingly, a layered, satiric response to many excesses of contemporary society at particular social and financial levels. That proposition should not sound colored by pretentiousness but be perceived as tinged by a plain rendering of the facts. In nearly every episode, there is a clear tension between amoral modernity and a traditionalism steeped in morality. And, infused through it all, is Duchovny's bemused, sometimes puzzled, even horrified take on ""Hell A,"" with the Hank Moody character even given to offering moral advice like some itinerant blue jean-clad street preacher (i.e. admonishments to Charley about the benefits of a loving wife and marital union). The more one watches Californication, the deeper the layers go--and the more the layer may be peeled back.",1532822400,,3786,5.65377855887522

8657363,1,B00KBIXQYS,"I threw this series in the trash where it belongs. The main protagonist is the same adulterous, alcoholic, drug using, a-hole at the end of this show that he was at the beginning. There is no story or character arc. Lousy show all around. I recommend you spend your time and money on something else.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1521158400,,1729,5.616858237547893
