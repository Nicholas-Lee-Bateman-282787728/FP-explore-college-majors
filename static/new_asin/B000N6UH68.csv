8175282,2,B000N6UH68,"I usually do not spend $25 for 30 minute DVD for my autistic children but figured that the high price reflects that they specifically target developmentally delayed kids and ordered the first 2 volumes.  Based on others' glowing reviews, I was sure that my high functioning autistic son would love them but he glanced a couple of times and continued his play.  While ""Watch Me Learn"" was still on, he requested another DVD. I was just as disappointed as he was.  I had an impression that these DVDs are of professional quality but they look like home-made videos with background music and some animation.  The kids in this DVD were years older than mine but on several occasions I myself had trouble understanding them, not only because of ""speech impediment"" that another reviewer mentioned but also because they did not pronounced the words clearly.  I thought it supposed to be ""modeling"" which would mean perfect pronunciation of words.  I was also wondering about modeling when Mary Beth was reading a book or another ""teacher"" showing ABC with pictures to the group of children.  Obviously, I am not going to buy the other volumes and do not recommend ""Watch Me Learn"" series.  I also bought ""Bounce"" DVD series with music therapist that are also produced for autistic audience and even my low functioning non-verbal son who rarely watches anything was interested in those.  I highly recommend ""Bounce"" to all families with autistic children.",1279929600,3,1448,4.950413223140496
8175283,3,B000N6UH68,My son likes it but I don't understand why it came with so many scratches and the DVD is supposed to be brand new. It started skipping the first time I put it in the player.,1270771200,,173,3.8333333333333335
8175284,5,B000N6UH68,"My 2.5 year old son really loves the Watch Me Learn videos 1 and 2. He has learned how to play simon says, freeze dancing (his dancing is absolutely adorable) ring around the rosey, and lots of social vocalization. He has also perfected his game of hide and seek- we play it constantly now! Kids on the spectrum really respond well to video modeling, and it seems to help him use what he sees a lot more effectively. He's learned to replace lines he's learned from Dora and Deigo with more appropriate responses he has learned in these videos. We also own Teach2talk WH questions, and he really responds well to them as well. We also own Kibbles Rockin Clubhouse, but I think he is a little young for that one.",1266019200,4,710,4.427480916030534
8175285,5,B000N6UH68,"This DVD is such a great idea because play skills can be a challenging concept for children on the autism spectrum.  I really like the play activities that are chosen in the DVD.  It's easy for kids to role model and it keeps their interest because there is singing, dancing etc.  A great way to learn.",1259366400,2,302,4.357142857142857
