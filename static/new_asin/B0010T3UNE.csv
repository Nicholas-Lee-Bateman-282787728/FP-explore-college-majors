8238535,1,B0010T3UNE,"It began as a very interesting and different story...then suddenly, there have been so many useless cuts in the film that you do not understand what has happening...the father who was a high figure in politics suddenly is in hiding for having killed people, what has happening to the wife etc...I even wrote to the company editing the movie and i have even not received an answer...looks like they edited the film quickly while sleeping or in between...Do not buy this NOT RECOMMENDED",1206230400,7,484,4.843373493975903
8238536,2,B0010T3UNE,"What I can't understand is why they would cut so much out of the DVD set, when they repeat the credits after each major chapter. If they would have cut out all the repeat credits prehaps they could have included more of the story!!!! The last side is cut up so much that you don't even know how Beatriz found her mother - please someone please tell me. And what's up with Juventino killing Ignacio's father. And what the heck happen to Marycarmen? My goodness what knuckhead at TV Azteca authorized the release of this DVD in it's state.",1203292800,10,537,4.434343434343434
