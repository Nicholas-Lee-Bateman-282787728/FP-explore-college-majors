What made things worse is that I could at no moment relate to the main character: He is not a poor little boy who is drawn into the hustler/porn scene by circumstances. He is a stubborn youngster who runs away from a loving home and from school, who actively looks for the hustler scene, but who is not intelligent enough to survive- first he has the old pimp (whatever his name is, Monza or something like that) take advantage of him, then another hustler.

1068090,5,6305777837,"The story is not unusual or even original.  I have seem a couple of films that deals with prostitution and it's downfall.  A recent release is another foreign movie called ""Midnight Dancers"", one of the many movies filmed in the Philippines that deals with prostitution.
American made movies that I can recall is ""Johns"" and that River Phoenix movie....
Reality is not often the think we want to face expecially when we deal with such harsh topics as child prostitution.  That doesn't mean we don't want to deal with it doesn't exist because it does.
Remember, prostitution is everywhere.  Prague is only one city. I can think of several places/cities that the community tolerates such conducts.
What bothers me while watching this movie (or any other movies dealing with such topics) is what could I do, our society do,  to assist these kids?  I try to rationalize by the fact that everyone has choices in life.  It's just bad that some people see things on a short range rather than on a long range.
Would I recommend this movie?  Absolutely!!!! I was just in Prague and is a regular visitor there.  I spoke with my partner (who resides there) about this movie and he did mention that he knew some people involved with the oldest profession.  But then again, even here in New York, I do know a few who sell's love by the hour.",1000684800,5,1328,4.6127659574468085
1068091,5,6305777837,"What ""Pusher"" did for the drug trade, ""Mandragora"" does for teenage male prostitution. It's an incredibly brutal and honest look at the life of a Czechoslovakian boy who runs away to Prague in order to escape an unhappy home life in a small town. Little does he know he had it very good at home. The film is incredibly graphic on all counts, but needs to be to make its point. This is not a film for children or the squeamish as there is full-frontal nudity, depictions of graphic sex, extreme violence, sadism, drug use, self-mutilation and suicide. It's an excellent film, but definitely not a happy film. In and of itself, this film rates 5 stars.
Now let's discuss the DVD itself. It's terrible. The studio that released this film, Water Bearer, apparently did so without love or care for this film, just the possibility of making some fast money. The print used for this transfer skips in several places (this is really unacceptable as the film is only four years old as of this writing), and could use some cleaning up and remastering (too many scratches and artifacts). Some darker scenes suffer from some very visible digital transfer problems. The sound is poor through some passages, resulting in background bass ""thumps"" whenever the characters speak. The English subtitles are riddled with blatant spelling errors, typographical errors and very poor grammar, most likely translated by someone for whom English is not a first language. A few scenes in English are subtitled in Czech, for some unknown reason. And, although this doesn't bear on the film directly, there are no extras. You either view the film in its entirety, select one of seven incredibly long chapter stops which will have you hitting the fast-forward button in frustration, and that's it! No interviews, no commentaries, no trailers, no talent files, nothing.
So buy this DVD for the story alone and you won't be disappointed. Expect more and you'll be sorry.",994204800,72,1940,4.899696048632219

The story, the actors, the image and sound quality are all good. I read another review that talked about all the nudity in this.  While there is certainly nudity, it's not porn so don't expect that.

1068225,4,6305777837,"This film is a very well developed picture of some of the depravity involved when runaway boys become male prostitutes in order to survive on the streets. They are subject to extremely violent criminal adult pimps that inflict violence upon them, pair them with dangerous sadistic customers, take their money, give them only enough money to barely survive, and generally terrorize them into submission and compliance.  Drugs play a role as underground currency as well as an emotional escape.  Because these kids are trying to survive, they are thieves and take advantage of their tricks if at all possible.

The film depicts this hell on earth world in a frightening constant flow of crisis after crisis for 15 year old Marek.  He pairs up with an older male prostitute, David, who is his mentor in crime, drugs, and sex.  He also emotionally attaches to David but David has little to give and is a runaway addict himself.  The violence depicted against children was horrific, possibly the worst thing i have ever seen on film.

The scenes where the boys are making porno films was incredible chaos. The film-maker is violent and threatening to the rent boys as he demands they become erect. This is a most telling scene about the relationship between sexual orientation, sexual behavior, and the need for some form of human intimacy to remain sane.

The film is not about gay entertainment and escapism, it is anything but a gay fantasy. It is however a horrific picture of man's cruelty and explotation to those who are more vulnerable.",1388534400,2,1539,4.869731800766283

1068229,5,6305777837,"If you want to see happy people living happy lives of excitement and positive end results, this is NOT the film for you.

Mandragora is a film about the side of Praha tourists fail to see. It follows Marek, a runaway from rural Czech Republic on his descent into prostitution, drugs, and disease. Sadly, it's a tale with some truth behind it; many of the extras are real-life hustlers and rent boys from the city. Though the bright lights of a big city are tantalizing and full of promise for many youths, the realities are far less spectacular.

When I first watched this film, it haunted me to no end. My ancestors left Czech Republic 100 years ago to seek a better life in America. While the story itself is greatly different than that of my relatives, the basic underlying idea is the same: the grass isn't always greener on the other side of the fence. Sometimes, the misery we live in is far better than the misery awaiting us in a new land. Life is a constant struggle for many people, and that is true regardless of your sexuality.

The footage on the DVD is not crisp. It is reminiscent of old 35mm cinema with its scratches and cue marks. I would have preferred some behind-the-scenes extras on the disk, but we don't always get what we want. If you can look beyond the superficial flaws, there is some beauty found in metaphors and coincidence. It's a film for the open-minded individual who can handle reality and unhappy endings.

It is far from perfect, and the DVD is a mess, but the astonishing power of the movie itself transcends all its flaws.

1068231,5,6305777837,"A 1997th year doco-style work explicitly reflects first post-years of a Czech-Republic-velvet-revolution euphoria, in which beautiful ancient capital, Prague the offspring of the 1968th year Prague Spring anti-communism warriors is simply used to prostituting and snoring drugs - the very habits of the already advanced in some free-from-moral sex-as-a-produce neighbouring western streets, reasoning the paedophiles from around a globe to visit new country for.

Although no explicit juicy-action depicted in this work originated from a modern hub of porno-industry, rating 18+(R) is a realistic classification of this tragic story about the youth lost to pity thievery, underage sex exploitation, drugs, AIDS and crime to simply survive.

In general positively depicted local police, perhaps, would one day reinstate a usual charm of history Prague had been famous (and did present it to foreigners, had even a hostility expressed openly to simultaneously) so attractive for in the days when busy train terminal was crowded by passengers from round Europe rather than hustlers only of a tiny age too often as this movie embedded.

1068346,3,6305777837,"While the director of this film deals with events that probably happen often, the way that the story is told is relentlessly downbeat.  It is hard to imagine that the people the hustlers represent have no good days.  I had to stop watching after Marek injures himself in a fit of dispair.  I couldn't bear any more.

Some people who pay for sex are abusive and some people who think they can make porn movies treat the models badly.  If you think nobody should hustle or be in a porn movie that's fine.  However if you are going to tell a story to get that point across then it isn't wise to go from scream-fest to drugged rape to beating then betrayal and so on without a break.

The performances were exactly right.  I did not feel like I was watching actors but real people.  That added to the horror.  Unlike other reviewers I did not feel the quality of the transfer was a problem.",1153958400,6,886,4.315151515151515
1068347,5,6305777837,"This is a complicated movie, with a dark subject, but a powerful one, worth lingering over. The movie charts the fall from innocence of 15 year old Marek into personal ruin and death after he runs away from home to Prague.

Despite the very sad plot, the movie is strongly voyeuristic. Ostensibly a moral tale warning of the pitfalls of the gay teen boy prostitution scene, the viewer will find himself fascinated as they watch this sweet boy be stripped of his small town innnocence, and sink into total debravity. Just as Marek achieves some level of stability, he is drawn down shortly into the next step of the personal disaster to which he is destined. Against his better judgement, Marek's lack of self-esteem causes him to be drawn into increasingly serious mistakes in judgement, until he reaches his final ruin.

Ostensibly about Prague's gay teenage prostitution scene, the movie is also an allegory about Czechoslovakia itself. If you understand Czech history, you'll recognize it in this movie. The Czech people struggled for hundreds of years to achieve national self-determination, only to have it smashed by the degradation of Hitler's Munich. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Czech Nation fell into the clutches of Stalinist Communism. The ""Prague Spring"" was ruthlessly repressed by Soviet invasion. The fall of Soviet Union only led to the disasterous 'privatization' as national symbols and assets of Czech pride were sold to Western Capitalists and Russian Oligarchs. Eastern European, and particularly Czech movies, all seem to have morose themes which I attribute to the tragic history of these societies.

The performances of the principle actors, David Svec and Miroslav Caslavka are outstanding. You'll fall in love with them both! And no one is a better director of the dark movie then director, Wiktor Grodecki. The music score is a great assortment of classical music that complements the dark plot. The photography of of backstreet Prague and rural Bohemia is worth the price of admission alone.

Because I ended up watching this movie several times, and picked up new things each time I watched it, I've given it 5 stars. This movie has a message, and unlike so much stuff out there is well worth your time to absorb it.",1149033600,9,2255,5.005333333333334
1068348,3,6305777837,"Mandragora is a good film masquerading as a poor film.

What does that mean?

The subject matter is one that deserves attention and the film does a decent job of laying out the horrors of runaway life for boys in Slovakia. However, the script (in part by one of the young performers) is too fragmented and the editing is sparse.

I thought the film was well done on the whole, but severe editing would have helped. It dragged in places and too much expositional material was present. Scenes should have been tightened up with more concise editing.

However the ending was quite Dickensian - a point I liked (if that can be used in conjunction with this film).

This is not a pleasant subject matter and it is not something that should be treated lightly. I think the makers of this film made an earnest effort to deliver an emotional film highlighting the daily horrors run away boys face in Prague.

Unfortunately, while the crux of the emotion is understood, the impact is diluted by the lack of focus and editing.

All in all, though a very good effort to shine the light on a very hot button issue.",1137974400,4,1102,4.507537688442211
1068349,5,6305777837,"NOTE: According to the dictionary: Mandragora is 1) a plant of nightshade family: a plant with a forked root resembling a human body that was formerly believed to have magical powers and was made into a drug and 2)a 14th century alteration of medieval Latin mandragora, influenced by man, drake ""dragon"" (from its emetic and narcotic properties).

MANDRAGORA, the astonishing film from the Czech Republic written by Wiktor Grodecki (who also directs)  and David Svec (who also acts in the film), is aptly named: mandragora is the world of male prostitution that seduces young lads with promises of money and ultimately poisons them with the burning disease of loss of self respect and ultimately of life.

Marek (Miroslav Caslavka in a stunning performance) is a beautiful 15-year-old kid from a little village in the Czech Republic who has aligned himself with petty criminals to have better things such as classy clothing, a lad whose single father (Jir&iacute; Kodes) demands he stay in school (yet is always in the background to salvage Marek's errant life situations) and who seems to be prepping his son for a better life.  Marek hates school, which he sees as merely a path to be a welder like his father.  The father and son collide after another crime spree and Marek leaves home for the big city promises of Prague.

Once in Prague Marek is observed by the pimp Honza (Pavel Skripal) who follows Marek, knowing that Marek's future in the city is doomed without Honza's 'protection'.  Within a day's time Marek's luck with the slot machines dries up and Honza convinces him to be his 'rabbit' - a male prostitute.  Marek's first encounter with an American 'john' ends disastrously and the beaten Marek returns to the streets where he encounters a fellow hustler David (David Svec).  Together they forge an alliance to escape Honza's compound and begin a life of successful prostitution.  They are bonded (the probability of Marek's actually being gay and physically attracted to David is strong) and together they encounter all manner of unseemly characters involved in the underbelly of Prague's male prostitution life.

Characters weave in and out of Marek's and David's life, each time leaving scars that grow more visible as does the threat of drug problems and AIDS.  They eventually consent to embrace the lowest level of making gay porn where the cruel director forces Marek to be sodomized by David.  They are raided by the police and Honza reappears as Marek's nemesis.  Through a series of drug-induced hallucinations and dreams Marek envisions what his future holds and his descent is stamped.  Yet at this point Marek's father journeys to Prague in search of his son, discovers his life style, is terrified and angry and tangentially passes Marek in a critical final scene that is devastatingly sad.

This film is dark, frank, cruel, realistic, and sweats with the evil of the belly of the beast that is Prague's underworld.  Yet the direction is so fine and, equally important, the acting by Miroslav Caslavka so sensitive that we as the audience are swept into an overwhelming compassion for these unfortunate lads whose seemingly only hope for a better life is one of humiliating degradation.  MANDRAGORA is a no holds barred examination of a dark life that maintains a precarious balance between caricature and character development.  Yes, it is lengthy at 126 minutes, in need of editing in areas, has faulty subtitles, and a strange musical score by Wolfgang Hammerschmid who extrapolates Puccini's 'Nessun dorma'  and Bach's 'Erbarme dich' and 'Wir setzen uns mit Tranen nieder' from the St Matthew Passion for heavy effects, and very dark cinematography by Vladim&iacute;r Holomek, but despite these sidebar problems, they only slightly mar the overall impact of a very important film.

1068350,5,6305777837,"Wiktor Grodecki's masterful film entitled ""Mandragora"" is by any standard, a stirring and gut wrenching example of poverty gone amok. The torrid film depicts the story of Marek, superbly played by Miroslav Caslavka, a troubled boy of fifteen who, bored with the juvenile pranks and idle antics in an average town, seeks the glitz and glitter of the city of Prague. Once there, he quickly realizes the needs of life in the big city come with a price, one which he cannot afford and thus succumbs to the hungry appetite of the predatory elements surrounding him. Beginning with the alluring promise of quick cash for services rendered, Marek, quickly realizes this means his 'innocence' which is taken after being drugged and raped. Escaping the inattentive and uncaring pimp, he descends into the depths of sexual perversions when he encounters and befriends a more 'experienced' partner who trades him to a dark, sadistic pair, leaving him broken and violated. The decent into the perverted practices continues when, after a brief respite, he finds himself beaten, left for dead and in the hands of a vicious pornographer. With his father searching for him, the boy having survived an appalling apprenticeship, delves into the illusionary and dead end world of drugs where father and son unfortunately miss each other by inches.

1068352,2,6305777837,"I have not seen another movie by this director-so I can not compare this DVD to his documentaries-but this movie is a small, heartbreaking, and hard to forget exploitation film.  The seductive cinematography allow us to see the Prague through the (almost) sympathetic eyes of a 16 year old hustler (Merek) who happens to be gay (he seems to be one of the few male prostitutes in this film who is).  The travelogue-style opening shots of Czechoslovakia suck us in to the bleak nihilistic underbelly of post communist Czechoslovakian society populated by people who dwell on the fringe, surviving any way they can from one day to the next.  Apparently, when the fog of communism lifted from this part of the Eastern Block, fascism replaced it with its trademark culture of violence-in a post AIDS world.  But this becomes incidental.
This motion picture is more like The Passion of Christ than My Own Private Idaho.  However, unlike Mel Gibson, this director mercifully spares us from many of the details of the violence inflicted, but the effects of that violence stay with us.  Intense, unflinching and gritty-at times difficult to watch, like an automobile accident in slow motion-the combined homoerotic and homophobic content (the inherent contradiction in this type of filmmaking) exploits as it condemns.  Not one of the cardboard characters who impacts Merek's downward spiral has many (or any) redeemable qualities-most are manipulative, self-centered and cruel.  Merek's youthful good looks and unsinkable innocence keep us watching, while his father's search for his prodigal son gives us hope.  One wonders why a filmmaker would become obsessed with the world of young male hustlers and wicked male predators.  Is this one self loathing homosexual's effort to paint a picture of modern Babylon through an exploration of his own desires?  Or greed? (Or both?)

1068353,3,6305777837,"The director of this film (Wiktor Grodecki) also did the documentary expos ""Body Without Soul"" just one year earlier in 1996.  Before you read further (or order this film), I suggest you go and rent/buy that DVD first.  ""Mandragora"" attempts to dramatize 97% of the content in ""Body...""
The story is simple (and almost clich for cinema, but not for real life).  Teenage boy (Marek) is fed up with school and his single father; who, incidently, obviously only wants his boy to have a better life than he.  Marek becomes a local punk/hoodlum and, in fact, the movie begins with his breaking into a store display window.  Still, the father even takes extra measures to deal with authority figures after his son's mischieviousness.
Regardless, Marek runs away on a train to Prague and, upon leaving the train, is targeted for induction into the seedy underworld of prostitution in Prague.  He's drugged, molested, paid...and in with the game.  He soon befriends David, who has high business hopes, but little experience to see them to fruition.  David helps free him of the pimp that found him at the train station.  Oh...and it should be mentioned that the drama includes no actual prostitution or [simulated] sex.  In fact, they soon have 30,000 czech crowns[],and you literally have to assume they got it through prostitution.
All along, we see their adventures through Marek's eyes.  The bars, the prostitution, understanding the pimps and the johns...all of these things are matters of course.  They move from being initial 'rabbits' (newcomers/fresh) to professionals, to entrepreneurs and ultimately into pornography.
The movie is often slow.  It actually takes 35 minutes for Marek to realize that he's becoming a prostitute...the actual point of the movie.  On top of that, the images are generally dark and the translations are poorly done.  In many cases, you often wonder what the heck they meant by certain statemtents.  Also, the continuity is horrible.  You never really know when and/or where they are in the story.  Then, suddenly they are sick with AIDS...after what seems like days or a few short weeks. (While AIDS takes months to physically effect the body)
Most unfortunate is that this movie is almost Plageuristic (?) of Wictor Grodecki's own earlier work ""Body Without Soul.""  He simply added actors acting out some of the scenes from the documentary...
The only truly GOOD part of the movie was played by the father.  He showed true emotion, longing, etc. that indicated that 'this is a man who is desperately seeking his son.'  He learns what his son has become and goes after the boy.  And, one of the few really great scenes in the movie involves him (toward the very end).
I suggest you RENT this one and buy ""Body Without Soul.""  It's more honest and true...and you'll appreciate the story and the concept more.",1046131200,15,2838,4.940928270042194

The problem with a movie dealing with this subject would offcorse be that it may put homosexuals in the light of them all being like the prostetutes costumers, but the thing is that I catch the story this way:
Marek is actually gay. He's scared or doesn't feel welcome at school and when his father asks he says:""you wouldn't understand""
But he can't tell anyone, because then he will be mocked for 'getting payed to have fun'. The signs are his rejection to girls,like his not interested. The way he sees to sort of fall in love with David, even though he is indeed a jerk. And of corse, the posters in his room.
So there you have a sympathetic gay-character.
To me it was quite obvious,but maybe it was just because I wanted it to be gay movie.

7894222,3,6305777837,"In case you have not seen ""Body Without Soul"" it is a documentary about the world of young male prostitutes in Prague which Wiktor Grodecki made the year before he made this drama.
This drama follows 15-year-old Marek, beginning when he steals a jacket from a store front and catches a train to Prague. Later a scene is shown which gives a hint at the family life he was running away from, which did not seem that bad. In Prague Marek is quickly picked up by a local pimp who drugs him and allows a customer to break him in. From there Marek's life is a downward spiral of sex, drugs and violence.
My main problem with this film is that it takes a lifestyle that is bad and seems to set out to make it seem even worse. I saw the documentary with the real male prostitutes in Prague. Their life is bad, but they are performing sex acts for their customers, getting paid, and going on with their lives. In this film I don't think Marek ever performed a sex act he had agreed to, collected his money and left. He was tricked, drugged, raped, doubled crossed, abused, tortured, and disfigured. The truth for these young men is bad enough, they did not need to go overboard with it. This film also has more nudity than the documentary, and is more graphic with its sex.",1402185600,,1264,4.337552742616034
7894223,5,6305777837,"MANDRAGORA delivers an appalling look into the seedy, decrepit underworld of Prague's male hustlers, depicting the callous, often sadistic exploitation of young gay teens who've ""lost their way"" in life.

The film is guaranteed to be one of the most disturbing...one of the most heartbreaking, yet one of the most worthwhile gay flicks you're likely ever to experience. I watched it spellbound via Netflix a few days ago and -- despite the fact I may never again be able to sit through its uncompromising portrayal of despair on the part of its pathetic protagonist -- I knew this was a film I had to own, simply (if nothing else) for the sake of owning it.

My keen recommendation aside, I urge you to beware and think twice before deciding to watch MANDRAGORA. The ironic twist at the end is positively devastating and may leave a bitter and indelibly haunting afterimage on the overly sensitive.",1401321600,2,898,4.824675324675325
