3874947,5,B0028X6L0K,"The artwork on the packaging was very well do. The series was very enjoyable. The dvd extras were so-so. The dvd extras for the original series were much better. The only bonus that came with the limited edition was volume 4 of the Code Geass manga. Considering the bonus items included with the limited edition versions of the original series, this is really kind of lame. Still, it is cheaper to buy the limited edition with the manga, than to buy the standard edition and the manga by themselves.",1253577600,,499,4.617977528089888
3874948,5,B0028X6L0K,I watched code Geass originally and found this series more based around brilliant planning than mechas. I do have to say that only placing 7 episodes in part 1 was something I did not like but the addition of the manga prompted be to buy the first three. I believe this is an excellent buy for any anime fan that likes more depth than simple carnage.,1251590400,,350,4.318181818181818
3874949,5,B0028X6L0K,"The series from the storyline right down to the DVD menu is spectacular. However, I like collecting the box sets and was looking forward to what this one had to offer. Sadly I was shocked to see I got a paperboard sleeve with a single DVD case and a manga book inside. I figured a limited edition would come with more. The previous box sets came with two DVD cases, a manga book, audio episode, and a soundtrack. This review is solely about the box set and not about the series. I hope others will take the time to see what a great storyline this series has to offer. I was just disappointed in the overall box set of the R2 Part 1 Limited Edition.",1250899200,18,648,4.192
3874950,4,B0028X6L0K,"On August 10th of the year 2010 the Holy Empire of Britannia began a campaign of conquest, its sights set on Japan. In the span of one month the island nation was conquered. As a dominion of the Empire the newly acquired territory was renamed Area 11. The rights of its citizens were severely limited and an economic depression followed for the Japanese, now known as Elevens. Just as things seemed at their bleakest one man chose to stand up and fight, the masked crusader Zero. Leading his Order of Black Knights, Zero instigated a full scale revolution against Britannia culminating in one fi nal battle, the Black Rebellion. Heavy casualties were seen by both sides but ultimately Britannia stood the victor resulting in Zero's execution. And thus was history written.

The year is now 2018. With Zero dead and the remnants of the Black Knights being swept up by the Britannian forces, a forced state of peace settles over Area 11. The rights of the Elevens remain limited but with no one to lead them and the defeat during the Black Rebellion hanging over them, the Japanese people remain under the boot of Britannian oppression with no hope to overcome.

This is an amazing series, one of the best in my eyes. The plot is quite pivotal, filled with so many twists and turns, all building up toward the climax of events finalizing this amazing series. The only downfall to this set (hence the four stars) is that it comes in a sleeve with just seven episodes and only the fourth volume of the manga (Bandai skipped the third volume completely), but for the price it's actually cheaper than the standard edition (more for less right). Also, it seems that the second season of Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion will be released in four parts instead of three.",1250812800,3,1765,4.690322580645161

3874952,5,B0028X6L0K,I am a fan of the Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion series and I was excited when I found this. I bought it from FRL at a good price. It came in the mail just four days after I purchased it online. I would recommend this product for anyone who is a fan of Code Geass.,1325894400,,269,3.736842105263158

3874954,3,B0028X6L0K,"Now i haven't actually bought this yet, but i have seen the whole series, and i'm hesitant on buying this for one reason....they're so expensive!! I remember buying the COMPLETE first season for the same price just ONE of these volumes (and there are four volumes in total) costs. Although i would like to hurry and complete the series, i don't want to spend 30 bucks a pop for each volume, i wish they would just release a ""Code Geass R2 the complete second season"" or something.",1314921600,10,480,4.528735632183908
3874955,5,B0028X6L0K,"Its been one year since the Black Rebellion and the death of Zero. Lelouch is living the life of an average high schooler together with his little brother Rolo and.... huh? It seems that Lelouch has completely forgotten not only Nunnally, but also his identity as Zero. Caught in an attack by the Black Knights, Lelouch meets with a mysterious women named C.C., who reminds him of who he is and of his true purpose.....

I was so confused when I started this season. I had to pause the episode and make sure there wasn't an OVA or something I was missing. But explanations come by the end of the episode and we get right back into the rebellion. And wow, the rebellion actually goes somewhere. I had high expectations from the first season of Code Geass, but I was still a little worried about being let down. But no, this season not only met my expectations, but exceeded them. It does have a lot more battle scenes than the first season, which I found a little boring, but the plot moves right along and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't know the last time I was so excited about a show/movie. I even had trouble sleeping at one point.

The ending seems to get mixed reviews from most people. I thought it was phenomenally done, but I can see why some people might not enjoy it. However, the series is just too good to miss, so forget about the ending and just watch the show!

One warning though. This is set 1 of 4. Hopefully one day they will release a boxed set, but until then prepare to sink some money into this show if you want to own it.

UPDATE 1/16/12 - Bandai is downsizing and will no longer release new DVDs after Febuary. They will continue to manufacture and release DVDs already available until their license expires. BUT LUCKY FOR US!!!! For on February 7 there is to be a boxed set release of Code Geass R2!

3874956,4,B0028X6L0K,"With part one you get two discs with seven episodes divided between them. It picks up one year after the first season, the first episode might be a bit confusing for first timers but just keep watching it will all make sense soon enough. Of this set episode two is my favorite, from beginning to end its Code Geass at its finest.  The only thing I would have liked are the picture dramas like from the first season.

3874957,4,B0028X6L0K,"CODE GEASS: LELOUCH OF THE REBELLION R2 gets off to a start that is both slow and absurdly abrupt, as we're suddenly introduced to a situation in which the main character(Lelouch) is behaving in ways that seem drastically out of character in several aspects, with no idea how he got there and where he suddenly picked up a strangely creepy little brother that'd never been mentioned before. This is resolved within the first few episodes when we get an after-the-fact explanation of what happened following Season 1's abrupt cliffhanger ending, but weakens the overall story somewhat.
However, Volume 1 also briefly introduces deuteragonist Li Xingke, who is sort of what happens when you take Lelouch, his rival(Suzaku), and toss them both into a blender with a heavy supplemental dose of awesome - unfortunately, he doesn't do anything much just yet. But the concluding episodes to this volume, while uncomfortably reminescent of last season's episode 21 in terms of a major plot point that is introduced, set the stage for the show to REALLY take off running, and Vol 2 and onwards much more favorably compare to Season 1.

All in all, while as most sequels do it can't quite measure up to the first season, it's a fairly solid start to an excellent follow-up.",1293062400,,1263,4.901869158878505
3874958,5,B0028X6L0K,"this is the anime for ones who have never watched one before or who are new to the concept.. this is the story of LeLouch V. Brittiana who is the 17th prince of Brittana. He was sent away by his father the Emperor Charles the 1st. He sendt his young son and daughter away for their safety, but would never tell them why or how this came about. But he (LeLouch) saw his own mother killed right in front of his eyes and young sister lost her sight, but not by any health issue, but because of the ""Power of The King"" called Geass... This power makes anyone subject to the will of the one who posses it. They obey with out question. He used thei power to gain the trust of the ""Black Knights"" and the use of their Knightmare Frames or Mobil Suits that would be able to destroy anything in their path.
He used them and their suits to gain control of the whole world and put them under hs total control, He even captured his own Brother the 2nd Prince Snyzell and the whole royal family to do his bidding. Even to die on the battlefields. He became a very crule person..

3874959,5,B0028X6L0K,Zero is back better than ever. These episode are really well done and prove that the author have not lost is touch. If you have not started watching code geass before do not start here code geass as one of the best character developement ever and watching all the change all the lead made (especially poor suzaku yes i said it i actually understand suzaku a little now) in the first season is very important toward understanding they view on the world. For some reason the first season is cheaper and include way mor contant with the dvd. but in my opinion these episode are worth getting just for the quality of the anime itself.,1274486400,,630,4.48695652173913
3874960,5,B0028X6L0K,"Code Geass is one of my favorites of all time, and every episode of R2 ramps the intensity higher and higher.  The characters grow so much, often in surprising or terrifying ways, while the animation/music never drops in quality.  Even the way it starts off throws you off balance if you remember the cliffhanger at the end of the first series, and it's all addictive.

However, the *only* limited edition feature in this box set is the bonus manga, so if you're not into the alternate universe Geass storylines with slightly different styled artwork, I wouldn't recommend it.  I don't own the other edition, but the runtime is exactly the same and the only thing listed under ""limited edition features"" on my box is the manga. The Limited Edition discs come in one case (with the manga filling the empty space in the sleeve, which makes it hard to shelve if you want to keep the sleeve unless you let the manga stay there), and I don't own the other edition so it's possible that the other one has two cases contained in each sleeve.

But honestly the Limited Edition is not worth the extra money since if you really wanted the bonus manga you could buy it separately with the other edition. And your total price would probably still be cheaper.",1271808000,3,1246,4.594594594594595

Season 2 starts off with Lelouch's same old life except Nunnally's not part of the picture since she's has been replace by a boy named Rolo. Of course fans will be confused as heck when they watch the first 15 minutes but don't worry episode 2 will clear some of the ambiguity.
 Rolo is actually a spie sent by an 'order' to keep an eye on Lelouch to see if anything changes with him. After Suzaku captured Lelouch in r1 episode 25, he turned Lelouch in to his father Charles zi Britannia. Charles believes it would better to erase Lelouch memories along with everyone who attends Ashford so that's how we end up at r2 episode 1. After C2 restores Lelouch's memories were back to r1 all over again except Black Knights welcome 'Zero' with open arms and Kallen knows who Zero really is.
 The reason why I don't like r2 as much as r1 is because everything becomes predictable. It's kind of easy to tell who they going to get rid of, like how they did with Euphy. Everyone has a geass (I'm exaggerating a little) and the ending is sort like Death Note (shocking I know -_-) But those who watch r1 should r2 so you can see how it really ends. And the ending, it's bittersweet but it's for the best.",1365033600,,1206,4.308370044052864
