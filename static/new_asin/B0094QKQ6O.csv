8536032,2,B0094QKQ6O,"I really want to learn more about French people called ""beurs.""  We don't have that many people of Middle Eastern descent here in the US, so I'm interested in learning about a Western country that does.  I saw a website titled ""Beurs: Nos Latinos.""  That's French for ""Arabs: Our Latinos.""  Beurs are the brown people and most populous non-white group in France just as Latinos are in the US.
Comedy is culturally specific; this plays a role in Black American films not doing well abroad, as many of them are comedies.  This film didn't have me rolling on the floor with laughter, but it was not absolutely terrible.  The film also felt veeeeery derivative.  It has a cast of friends of color like ""Friday.""  It has a few tall guys with their little-person buddy, aka like ""Jack*ss.""  Out of nowhere, one character shows he has a bear locked up in a storage room.  This clearly comes from ""The Hangover"" series, and if not, then certainly from ""Borat.""
The female beurs in the film do not wear hijab.  The one character in hijab bumps into a pole because her vision is obstructed.  However, I am veeeery surprised the joke was there as some could read it as Islamophobic.  You never hear the main characters speaking Arabic.  However, I didn't understand the French spoken here as much as in other French films.
It was a bit difficult to watch this as a Black person.  On the one hand, there is some bonding between Blacks and beurs.  There may even be two Black-brown, Reese's butter cup couples, by the end of the flick.  However, there's a lot of talk of Black men being well-endowed and as men who often cuckold other men.  This film has some prejudiced cops that is also characteristic of ""Boyz N da Hood,"" ""New Jersey Drive"" and other New Jack flicks.
The film is really only vaguely about porn.  A producer says to the main characters who wanted to do blue movies, ""You must prove yourself by working with an atypical, unattractive lady to prove you can keep it up.""  In Porn Valley, this is supposedly true.  Guys have to work with older women, fat women, in group scenes, before they can do solo stuff with the A-list actresses.  This film was more about rap music and street rivalries than the English translation would lead you to believe.
There's one quick shot with French porn star Manuel Ferrara.  However, the cameo porn appearance that is a surprise at the end comes from a certain blond, Italian gentleman.  Hint-hint!  There's a good amount of female cleavage here.  Only male cleavage, aka plumbers' cracks, are present for those who like nudity ""from a male perspective.""  The guys here wear tighty-whities often.  Maybe boxers aren't the trend in France the way they are in the US.",1423958400,,2703,4.6455696202531644
