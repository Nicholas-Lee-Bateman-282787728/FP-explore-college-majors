243220,4,6300215520,"Indeed, there is no question in reviewing the premise of this film: the Earth WILL be destroyed. It's not just a matter of blowing a piece of cosmic debris out of the sky...
Doing my best to place myself in the position of one of the myriad cast, I have found the experience of viewing this film to be rather terrifying. And certainly the producers of ""this telling"" have done an outstanding job of translating the novel (written in the early '30s) into a cinematic ""nightmare.""
Crisply told in an almost typical '50s style, the story moves along with little baggage to hold it back. And while the special effects are lacking in comparison to today's CG capabilities, they easily suffice for what the director was trying to convey.
Prior to the launch of the ""space ark,"" the steady build-up of anticipation and urgency effectively causes the audience to experience the panic and paranoia of Earth's final moments. Just imagine watching your world vanishing from existence...
Finally, I recommend that one read the original novel (recently reprinted) which contains a more detailed exposition of humanity in the face of certain doom. Besides, the novel also features the sequel to the first story, written shortly after the original by the same authors. It's quite a tale in and of itself.

243221,4,6300215520,"George Pal's 1951 flick still holds the interest as it tells the tale of mankind's attempt to continue the species after the impending collision of the planet with a big old rock from space.  The effects were groundbreaking for the time, garnering Oscars.
Sure, there are no persons of color onboard the ""space ark,"" and the ""science"" was unbelievably absurd.  However, the film does entertain and features some realistic scenes of destruction, courtesy of great matte paintings.
Although there are no ""stars"" in the cast, character actor John Hoyt stands out in a role he perfected in so many films and television shows: a pompous aristocrat whose sole purpose in life is self-preservation at the expense of others.  As the ""villain"" of the piece, he makes for one who is easy to ""hiss.""",974937600,4,788,4.909774436090226

243349,4,6300215520,"I absolutely loved this movie when I first saw it in 1951 (and still love it). My only complaint was the painted background scenery at the end of the film when the space ship landed on the planet Zyra. It kind of took away from some of the movie's effort for realism. A great scene like maybe a photograph of a tropical island oasis would have been much more believable. I was quite surprised to see actor, Kirk Alyn in a cameo shot, and who had portrayed Superman in the 15 chapter serial ""Atom Man Vs Superman"" only a year prior in 1950, and also in the first 'live' ""Superman"" serial in 1948. Thoughts went through my mind that even Alyn, with all of his super powers, would not be able to save the world from this impending disaster.

243355,4,6300215520,"In 1951, it must've been viewed as the granddaddy of disaster movies. When Worlds Collide is based on the 1933 science-fiction pulp novel by Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie. Let's slip into the story bubble: For the past two years, eminent astronomer Emery Bronson has been engaged in agitated activity, hoping against hope his calculations were wrong. Movie opens at a remote South African observatory as Bronson entrusts playboy pilot David Randall (Richard Derr) with custody of a black box so mysterious it's piqued the curiosity of the Sentinel newspaper, so much so that it's offered $5000 to Randall for an exclusive peep at its contents. Randall may be roguish but he's honest.

He transports the box to a New York university and forks it over to professorial stargazer Dr. Hendron (Larry Keating), and it's Dr. Hendron who confides that the world is ending. The box reveals top secret scientific data which confirms the alarming news. From three billions miles away, the rogue star, Bellus, and its orbiting planet, Zyra, are charting a course for our solar system, and due to arrive in less than a year. At 1pm, on July 24th, the satellite planet is projected to pass close enough to Earth that it will influence the tides and trigger tsunamis and earthquakes. Nineteen days after, on the morning of August 12, its star will collide directly with the Earth and utterly crush it.

Less than a year left until doomsday. Time enough, perhaps, to build a space ark to convey a droplet of humanity to the potentially inhospitable alien planet of Zyra. Much of the movie documents this mammoth last-ditch endeavor, from when the desperate Dr. Hendron, seen as a crackpot, tries to drum up sufficient capital to the final day that finds Hendron's project lagging 32 minutes behind schedule. On a more personal slant, the movie tracks the developing relationship between Randall and the professor's stunning scientist daughter Joyce Hendron (Barbara Rush). Dr. Tony Drake (Peter Hansen), good guy at heart, is the fella on the outside looking in in this romantic triangle.

When Worlds Collide is a milestone motion picture that boasts Oscar-winning special effects that were impressive in its time, bolstered by stock footage of natural disasters and the use of technical advisor Chesley Bonestell's (unconvincing) painting of Zyra's landscape as a matte. About that last bit, see, Paramount Pictures was eager to capitalize on the success of producer George Pal's 1950 release, Destination Moon, and so rushed production of When Worlds Collide. Pal, that maven of disaster cinema, had only intended to use Bonestell's painting as a guide from which he could build miniatures. But then the suits got greedy.

The source material, first serialized in Blue Book Magazine from 1932 to 1933, reportedly partly inspired Alex Raymond to create his 1934 comic strip, Flash Gordon. And why not? Parallels abound: Earth menaced by a fast-coming planet; the studly action hero; his steadfast girlfriend; the wise older scientist; the three of them journeying to a new world by way of atomic rocket.

Except this movie, for the most part, is consigned to our home planet. We're exposed to the disbelief of the masses, and the scoff of the United Nations delegates, and the squabbling of those in the scientific community. But, then, as the two heavenly bodies careen ever nearer at incredible speeds, observe man's uglier side begin to emerge. From jump, it was common knowledge that human cargo will be confined to 7000 pounds, or, put another way, only forty-four random souls will find passage aboard the space ark, those who win the lottery. But what about the losers? It's hoped that they greet their doom with fatalistic grace. Hah.

Directed by Rudolph Mat, When Worlds Collide dabbles in ambitious storytelling and, for the most part, gets away with it. Once past the hemming and hawing, the movie buckles down and starts to track the stages in which over 600 men and women frantically work on the rocket ship. Mileage may vary, but perhaps one flaw in the movie is that it doesn't dedicate enough screen time so as to keep pace with how the world at large was coping and, later, to present the proper scope of the devastation wrought in Zyra's wake. Given, doing justice to ""oceans torn from their depths"" was beyond that era's capability. My favorite bit of movie effects has to be the majestic mile-long rail slide that's supposed to propel the rocket ship skywards (and thus save fuel).

The narrative instead focuses on a tiny sample size of humanity, on the soap opera antics of our core characters and on the progress of a very civil and industrious work force of 600 as they race against human extinction.

I wish, too, that the movie had shown what became of the other rocket ships that were being built by other countries.

I can't help but think that the actual story begins when the survivors set foot on their new world, and that the stuff that had gone on before was essentially set-up material. Unfortunately, the 1934 sequel, After Worlds Collide, which details the settlers' efforts to establish a colony on Zyra, never did get adapted to cinema. You can blame George Pal's 1955 brain child, Conquest of Space. It bombed so hard at the box office that Pal's career got kicked to the curb and ruined any chance of a sequel.",1503705600,,5337,4.901439645625692

243399,5,6300215520,"Just finished watching ""When Worlds Collide"" released by Paramount.
Fresh from his success with ""Destination Moon,"" George Pal took on the adaption of ""When Worlds Collide"" based on the novel first published in 1933 Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie.
While working at a remote observatory in Africa, eminent astronomer, Dr. Emery Bronson discovers that a rouge star and it's single orbiting planet are on a collision course with Earth.  Humanity has less than one year to survive.
To verify his findings, Dr. Bronson sends his research and photographic evidence by special courier Dave Randall; who just happens to be an ace pilot, to Dr. Cole Hendron and his mathematician daughter Joyce to verify the findings - which they do to their sheer horror.
There is only once chance for humanity to survive as a species - a select group of people can be sent to the planet  Zyra - which orbits the deadly star Bellus before the destruction of planet Earth.  Naturally, like what happened to Noah, Dr. Hendron's warnings fall on deaf ears with the United Nations, but a group of industrialists and millionaires provide the initial funds to build a rocketship that will act as an ark and carry about 40 people to safety on the mysterious world of Zyra - which may be able to support human life.
What makes ""When Worlds Collide"" a classic is the special effects - which won the movie an Oscar.
Balmer and Wylie did write a sequel titled ""After Worlds Collide"" in which the many scattered survivors of a now destroyed Earth find that they may not be alone amongst the ruins of a previous civilization on Beta Bronson - the name for Zyra in the novels.
A very enthralling, edge-of-your seat science fiction movie.

243406,5,6300215520,"Watching this Movie was pretty fun. I had not seen it in some 40 years, but I did remember some of it, especially the ending, and I wanted to watch it again. This movie won an Oscar for Special Effects, and was nominated for an Oscar for Cinematography. It did not win an Oscar for any acting, although maybe they should have nominated Frank Cady. If you watch closely at the people in the ""Space Camp"" about half way through, you will see a very young Stuart Whitman as an extra.
While this movie could have been arguably better on many levels, (drama, science, dialog), it kept a pretty positive perspective considering that ""The End of the World"" is the key subject matter. (Only in the Movies). In some ways, this movie is kind of a ""time capsule"" of both American and Hollywood culture and perspectives in story-telling for that era.
In short, I enjoyed watching this piece of movie history and I hope not to have to wait another 40 years to watch it again sometime.

The movie is a little bonkers in science details. Spoiler alert. A star and its planet are on a collision path with Earth. First comes the planet that cause earthquakes and so on. Then comes the star that collides with Earth. If a real star showed up, the bigger one would pull material from the smaller and no planet would escape, yet here off go a few humans to the new planet that just busted up Earth by passing by.

An interesting tidbit. There is some talk by scientists opposed to the idea of the destruction to come that a rocket in space would not be successful. I remember before the 1957 Sputnik launch that it seemed half of the scientists believed that a rocket could not work in outer space, a vacuum, because there was no air to push against. True story.

A special aircraft is built to help some get off the planet to find a new world. It reminds me of the Twilight zone and The Day the Earth Stood Still.,1461369600,,279,4.090909090909091

243490,2,6300215520,"When you compare it to another little flick (""The Day The Earth Stood Still"") that was released in the same year, ""When Worlds Collide"" has a pulpy B-Movie feel.  The stock characters are all there. The handsome but smarmy ladies man, who you first see making out with a pretty blonde lady in the cockpit of a plane that *he's piloting*!  Then there's the brilliant, beautiful and classy female scientist who falls so hard for the guy that she breaks up with her fiance after knowing the former for a couple of hours. The fiance becomes part of a lover's triangle that exists until he gives up the fight for his former wife-to-be to allow her to be happy with her new infatuation. Too much time is spent on that uninteresting love story, but they needed to fill up some time since the sci-fi portion is lacking. This movie is like a predecessor to ""Armageddon"" except that the Earth is threatened by a huge rogue sun traveling through the galaxy with a single planet orbiting it rather than an asteroid. Since the sun is thousands of times larger than the Earth, there's no feasible scientific solution to stop it. So they decide to build a spaceship as an ark for a small number of scientists, a handful of other people chosen by lot, animals, plant life, etc.  We see the characters scrambling to complete the space ark in enough time to escape.  And the movie goes on to its inevitable climax.

The effects are passable for a movie of that Era,  and the acting is what you'd expect... OK,  but even not in the same galaxy as the performances of Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal in TDTESS.  This movie was used by producer George Pal to cut his teeth.  He would go on to direct the far superior sci-fi classic ""War of the Worlds"" in 1954.

If you're looking for a stock 50's sci-fi adventure and aren't put off by the fact that it slots somewhat above the movies lampooned on Mystery Science Theatre, but falls short of the classics mentioned earlier, this might be worth 1-1/2 hours of your time.",1459209600,,1999,4.512465373961219

The cast was really great also and not a lot of overdone melodramatics with music to coincide with those dramatics.

The pace of this movie actually picks up pretty fast and stays that way through the very predictable ending.

compared to today's CGI blockbusters; however if one resets their mindset back to early 50's mode and just enjoys this George Pal production
for what it is (was?)  then I think you may agree with me that it has aged well.  Still one of my favorites of all time, along with Howard Hawk's

There's a mad scramble to build a rocket ship (a then modern version of Noah's Ark) to take a small group of people to start over on a new world.  Of course there's the ultra rich old crippled very sour (did I mention old) coot that tries to buy his way on board cause he doesn't want to die (little did he know he'd been dead for years, his heart anyway).  Then you have a love triangle between the scientist's daughter (Barbara Rush), the doctor who wants to marry her (but deep down she's not really interested) and the dashing playboy hotshot pilot (that she falls in love with).

243877,5,6300215520,"Astronomers and scientists have made a startling discovery. A star, called Bellus, is on a collision course with Earth in less than a year. The collision will mean the end of humanity. There is one hope. Astronomers have also discovered that there is an Earth-like planet, called Zyra, in orbit around Bellus. American industry leaders begin to build a spaceship, a sort-of modern day Noah's Ark, to carry people, animals, and the remnants of civilization from the doomed Earth to Zyra. But time is running short and the spaceship can only carry so many people.

This movie is a great piece of classic science fiction. By the standards of the day, the special effects are pretty neat. (Indeed, the film won an Academy Award for them.) It certainly is a good example of one of George Pal's greater science fiction films.

In conclusion, this is a fun film that I would recommend to those that like classic science fiction films.",1420934400,,927,4.7875

One of the fumiest things in this movie was when the Scientist had found it the second time a year after they first spotted it. He gets up from his chair in amazement after doing the calculations completely surprised. Not only was this star on a direct path for earth but it was traveling faster than anything he measured before. It was blazing through space. It had traveled a million miles in a year. Man that's cruising. Actually its a little less than 3,000 mph or about 20% faster than the SR-71 Blackbird. The space station lumbers along at 17,000 mph. I laughed and thought you will of died of old age by the time it hits earth.

So now the story turns to a space ark to save mankind but only a few can go. The Billionaires get together to build their own spaceship and we have a little class warfare not fair stuff.

Today's young people will undoubtedly laugh at the funky sets, the often-wooden acting and the lack of ethnic diversity (no people of color on the rocket to the new planet), but this film is worth four stars if only for its historical value and amusement quotient.

By the way, the lack of ethnic diversity on the U.S. escape rocket could have set the scene for a sequel, which was not so common in the 1950's:  Other nations were building escape rockets, too, and had those ships also made it to the new planet a basis could have existed for a subsequent film dealing with international and inter-ethnic disagreements and conflicts (U.S. colony vs the Russian colony, Cold War redux, etc.).",1411689600,,836,4.798611111111111

244295,2,6300215520,"I didn't see this movie when it was first released (I was just 5, and my parents likely thought the futuristic picture was ""beneath them."")  If I'd been allowed to sit in a theatre and watch the earth being destroyed back then, I probably would have remembered the movie as well as other reviewers--and young enough to overlook the visual lapses and ho-hum script.

Most sci-fi or horror movies do not age well...in fact, many age prematurely.  This one, too.

Poor George Pal; too bad he didn't have just one-third of the 7 million dollar budget of the year's roman epic, Quo Vadis. Given that kind of dough, no telling what the producer of War of the Worlds--a much better picture, just two years later--would have been able to do. At the very least, George Pal could have had his crew miniaturize the new ""earth"" with the best of them, and avoid the laughable painted landscape that greets our travellers in the final scene. However, given the state of the special effects ""art"" at the time, Pal's bunch didn't do badly (and given the choice between doing as much as he could rather than put the money into better-known ""stars"" Pal made the right decision.)

Given that the effects won the Oscar for 1951, three things are apparent (1): When Worlds Collide didn't have much competition, or, (2) the state of the ""art"" was pretty primitive, or (3) both. I'd opt for #2. Miniatures don't make it today, especially the flood scenes where big drops of water are all out of proportion to what ""flood waters"" are destroying, or fire scenes in which a single flame appears half as big as the space ship itself! The film nuts who complain about today's computer-generated effects should see this movie to realign their perspectives!

To think this quaint apocalyptic thriller was made the same year as Robert Wise's gripping, provocative sci-fi classic, The Day The Earth Stood Still!  Now, that's ""art""--and better than the recent remake produced over half a century later!

244298,4,6300215520,"This 1951 SF film shows of course its age, but is still a darn good watch! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

A new star is discovered near our solar system, on a collision course, approaching fast - VERY FAST! Some amongst scientific community believe it can pass near Earth, close enough to burn all life on our planet - and those are the optimists... Then, a planet orbiting this new star is discovered... I will say no more about the story.

This film is based on a popular SF novel written in 1933 and therefore is definitely NOT linked to any kind of Cold War scares, unlike what some critics wrote back in the 50s. Far from being a parabol of nuclear war, both the book and the film are in fact SF variations on the theme of Deluge and Noah's Ark...

This review will be short, because I really don't want to give away too much - so let me just say, that this film indeed is aged and yes, the plot has many holes, but it still remains a nice watch and of course a pretty powerful story, with the ending being particularly good.

Actors are mostly forgotten today, even if both Richard Derr and Barbara Rush had a long and rather succesfull career, mostly on TV - she also played the main female character in another SF classic from 50s, ""It came from Outer Space"" (1953). Veteran specialists of second roles, Larry Keating and John Hoyt are in fact even more important in this film than actors who are in principle cast in leading roles.

A sequel was planned, to be based on the second part of the book, ""After Worlds Collide"", but ultimately the project was abandoned. A remake of this film was considered also already for some time, but for the moment it seems also that all those plans were shelved. And it may be for the better, because this film, with all its weaknesses, still packs some punch and is still a darn good watch. Enjoy!",1401148800,,1871,4.395953757225434
244299,5,6300215520,"It always ends the same though (just kidding...).

I guess I just really enjoy so many scenes and performaces in this film, that by the time I see them all, the movie is over.

It has a lot of overlapping storylines and images that, for me, make it fun to watch...the romantic element and the attendant rivalry; the benevolent financiers, and the rich villain; Green Acres' Mr Drucker with a pistol - I can't get over it; the UN scene (when the UN was relatively new) where skepticism wins out; the drama of who lives and who dies: the turning of the calendar pages and the ticking of the clock, and that VOICE over the loudspeaker; the vintage helicopter and the cars - as well as the costume design; the DF, just one step ahead of Charles Babbage's difference engine from 1847 (I love all the cams and such on the machine); and yes, I AM hooked on the special effects.

Richard Derr just kind of cracks me up (I think he makes the film especially enjoyable for me), and Barbara Rush is fantastic.

Call me old fashioned, but in the present day where what passes as movie making (to offer up to the hoi polloi) seems to rely so heavily on zombies; vampires; comic book characters; torture and dismemberment; serial killers; hauntings and possessions; underground fight clubs; dance crews; spring break; unfunny comedies; and remakes of movies that didn't need to be remade...if that's all we have, then I would prefer to appreciate the past.

Absolutely, if you allow for a certain lack of plot development. Given its production decade, the special effects were stunning and, if I recall correctly, won an Academy Award. There is some weird science, which is draw directly from the novel where the authors should have known better, regarding gravity. The chances are, however, that today's audience wouldn't notice on the whole. A survey released last week indicates that 51% of the American Public doesn't believe in astrophysics, that Relativity is nonsense (try navigating without having your GPS adjusted by relativity framed math algorithms!) and that there are no such things as Black Holes. Oh, yes. And the Earth is 6,000 years old. For those who require Matrix level special effects, they're likely to be disappointed. Those who appreciate the SF genre in context should enjoy and appreciate the film. Like the book, the film has a not too subtle Christian/Noah undercurrent which, depending on your persuasion, can be annoying or enhancing...your call. I like the film and my childhood memories of it enough that I also purchased a model of the space craft used in the film.

Scientists and technicians have only about a year to build a space ark that hopefully will salvage a bit of humanity and livestock and try to populate the rogue planet.

I think it's because, way back then, entertainers had to be more clever, because they were prohibited by law from being vulgar. Now-a-days there're no rules, so no effort has to be expended. To be clever requires actual talent. To be vulgar only requires a vocabulary of words about violence, drugs, profanity ( most of the script ), thoughtlessness, cheap explosions, and cheaper sex.

WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE is a perfect example. A very simple theme is treated with characters who actually have, ....well, .....character. It's well written, well acted, well conceived, and well presented.

I guess the remake, if ever there is one, will be called ""When F-ing Worlds F-ing Smack To-F-ing-gether.""

244555,5,6300215520,"When Worlds Collide is based on a book of the same name, which influenced movies from this one to Deep Impact and Armegeddon.  Parts of the book have been changed to make the movie more entertaining.

Produced by legendary sci-fi producer George Pal, When Worlds Collide tells the story of what happens when astronomers discover that the world is on a collision course with a rogue star.  Scientists desperately try to create a ""space ark"" to send survivors to a planet accompanying the rogue star, in the hopes of saving a small remnant of the human race.

Released in 1951, the movie offers some good color and good acting.  The lead male reminds me a bit of Danny Kaye, but thankfully never bursts into song or starts dancing.  Sharp-eyed viewers will notice Hayden Rourke (Doctor Bellows from I Dream of Jeannie) or Stuart Whitman (Those Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines), but the real star is the 1951 special effects, which look pretty good even today, although they use a lot of miniatures and matte paintings.

But the story has huge holes, especially late in the going. Apparently Pal ran out of money late in the production and had to use a concept drawing for the final scene instead of a full matte painting. Between that and the errors of that scene -- springtime where a moment ago everything was covered in snow, a building in the shot with no explanation of what civilization built it -- the movie's finish is confusing rather than thought-provoking.",1389744000,,708,4.80327868852459

Earth is menaced by a runaway planet entering our orbit, with a companion world that may prove a heaven if humanity can complete ""space arks"" in time.

The characters are vivid and worth caring about; and the effects, though spectacular, never detract from the human drama. Its love story feels integrated into the plot instead of grafted on as an afterthought.

When first serialized in Colliers magazine, this tale by Phillip Wylie and Edwin Balmer was a national obsession. Even the guys printing it stopped the presses to read it with the wet ink smearing their hands!
This interpretation holds up very well for its age, too. The Chesely Bonestell matte paintings and spaceship design still look fresh and graceful, the score by frequent George Pal collaborator, Leith Stevens augments the beauty and suspense, and every actor in this plays it straight. Of particular note is the solid, stoic performance of Larry Keating, a fine dramatic actor although most famous for playing the neighbor of Wilbur and Mr. Ed; here he stands up to his greedy counterpart, financier of the lifeboat rocket launch, John Hoyt.

Heck, there was the possibility of Martians back then, without a hint of methane as we know today. And yet, although it seems to present itself as a sci-fi thriller, it was also a deeper commentary about the humans who were  about to be annihilated and those who were ""chosen"" to survive . Moreover, what will our present state of, do I dare say, speculation of the demise of the final frontier be deemed? Asteroids? Or us?

The acting is not the best, the effects could probably leave a little to be desired, but I guess its just the concept of the story that appeals to me.  If you put yourself into the position of the characters and the situation and pretend it is happening to you, it makes it more fun.  It's also one of those things that could happen and if it did, you need to ask yourself ""how would I handle it.""

The star named Bellus is about to engage The Earth dispatching all of humanity not to mention our fury little friends. Only a hand full of people will be able to escape. Sort of a modern Noah's ark. We even get treated to a far more dangerous threat ""government gridlock"".

The main love interest in the movie is Joyce Hendron (Barbara Rush) which is the mark of a true 50's sci-fi; see her again as an exotic alien in ""It Came from Outer Space"" (1953).

It rates with other early movies, such as War of the Worlds (original one, not the remakes), the Time Machine (also the original), and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  All of these rely on some sort of realism and good presentation to make them worth watching, not like current sci fi, which usually relies on jazzy special effects.

It's one of those movies made in the 50's when you could say things like ""we're going to have to build this spacecraft from scratch in 8 months!"" and people actually believed that would happen. The script/dialogue is passable, so is the acting. The idea of the movie, a planet is heading on a collision course with Earth, isn't exactly a new idea now, but in 1951 it was pretty radical. What makes the movie fun is the unbridled enthusiasm exhibited by all of the people building this 'Noah' Ark' sort of space craft. Only about 50 of them can make it onboard, yet thousands toil day and night to make this dream come true. The American spirit was alive and well back 60 plus years ago. The final shot, which is a matte painting which was tacked on to the end of the movie and was only intended to be used in promotional trailers, ended up being shipped with the movie prints and eventually became part of the lore of the movie.

244935,5,6300215520,"Perhaps it's because the book is so incredible, but I can't seem to stop watching this movie.  Whenever I don't see anything on that I like, I always seem to be drawn back to it.

The plot:  Two rogue planets are found entering the Earth's solar system, one will pass by the Earth and enter orbit, but the other will impact the Earth and completely destroy it!  Faced with little time, and an unbelieving public, and small band of scientists begin to build a space ark in the hopes they can leap off one world and onto a new one.

First the good:  The movie has a nice sense of timing and suspense.  It builds slowly and never lets up.  A strong cast helps the story along, especially Larry Keating who does an excellent job as the serious scientist and leader Dr. Hendron.  The tense scene when he informs the United Nations of the coming end, only to be insulted and scorned, is classic.  Some of the sets and matte paintings are extremely good for their time. The external shots of the ship particularly stand out.  There is a love triangle sub plot that adds a dimension, but the focus is where it should be the coming end of the world.

Of course anyone reading this review will know the name, Ray Harryhausen.  As head of special effects in this movie, he pulls out all the stops.  Volcanoes erupt, dams collapse, bridges are washed away, the city of New York floods, and finally the ship launches all in beautiful and extremely creative scenes. (no CGI!)  Ray uses every trick in his book, from mist and smoke in front of paintings, to finely crafted miniatures, to food colored oatmeal lava.  Sure it's Sunday afternoon sci-fi movie, but his special effects make it memorable.

Now the bad: The love triangle is badly handled and degenerates to a soap opera level.  Ray falls a little short at the end and the last scene of the new planet is obviously two-dimensional, and the matte shot is nowhere near the quality of the others in the movie.

If ever there was a film dying to be remade by Speilburg, this is it.  I was a little disappointed that some of the best parts of the book, a fight against the remnants of humanity turned barbaric against the tiny compound, and the flight across the country by three of them in search of survivors were either missing or truncated, but overall the movie is one of the best popcorn films around.",1370563200,2,2347,4.477647058823529

244984,4,6300215520,"Another movie recently viewed with little to no foreknowledge of its contents, ""When Worlds Collide"" surprised me multiple times across the board, leaving me wanting more! (Although I know any attempt at a sequel would have been cheap, cheesy, and dismal).

Starting off with a simple delivery task, a pilot/courier is rapidly ushered deeper into knowledge of a forthcoming worldwide catastrophe.  Aside from knowing that the contents of his package has greatly disturbed the scientists assigning him the task, we know nothing about the events unfolding and join the courier as he perpetually learns more about an upcoming radical event and then decides what his role in everything should and must be.  The courier, Dave Randall, played by Richard Derr, is a bit stiff at times, but ultimately exhibits many of the best traits of mankind: love, insightfulness, and unselfish camaraderie with his fellow Earth-dwellers.

Opposite of Richard Derr's Randall, we have Barbara Rush playing Joyce Hendron.  Rather than being your typical sci-fi floozy or stick in the mud scientist, Joyce wonderfully coheres with Randall to form a dynamite presence.  Their relationship is part of a love triangle that plays out in a satisfying, clich-defying manner that adds tension at the right moments and gives even more life to the story as a whole.  Watching the three components of this romance is believable and full of heart instead of simply retreading well-worn avenues.  The artful way of handling this aspect of the movie is one of many that ""When Worlds Collide"" has that modern day Hollywood has simply just lost to the mists.

However, this movie is more that a love story set against the background of an impending world disaster (a la Deep Impact /barf).  ""When Worlds Collide"" also takes many opportunities to look at just how society would react should news like the scientists' discovery come to light.  And it is done tactfully and with insight.  To me, it seems like this movie set the stage for this theme which we see in movies like ""Signs"" and ""Contact"".

The supporting cast has many familiar archetypes, most notable being the millionaire who thinks money will still call the shots, right to the end.  These characters are fleshed out from decently to excellently.  The movie features sets and special effects that range from the expected to imagination-driving. Pleasantly surprising is the fact that the sets all feel natural; I never stopped and said ""Gee, I wonder if that was thrown merely to justify/increase the budget,"" or ""Heh, that was just to detract from the lameness going on.""  This movie needed no such cheap devices.

As the movie steamed ahead, there were two times that my viewing partner and I thought would be the end, saying to each other 'Well, this is going to happen and that will be that; the movie will come to a satisfactory close soon.'  Much to our shock, as we would have been okay with the movie ending at those points, the movie was not winding down but instead kicked things up another explosive notch with fresh waves of excitement.

""When Worlds Collide"" is remarkable movie with a few flaws, but nothing that detracts from the movie being a prime example of what it takes to deliver fantastic sci-fi.  Filled with imaginative ideas, serious social examination, and an excellent romance in the form of a deftly-crafted love triangle, I find it hard to discern a reason to not recommend this movie.",1368144000,,3439,4.947826086956522

If a worldwide catastrophe is on tap, the resulting behavior is guaranteed to reach a boiling point. That's what happens in this sci-fi take on Earth facing doomsday due to an impending collision with another heavenly body. A select few are granted redemption via a rocket that will take them to a new home but the unwashed masses who aren't so lucky have other plans.

Normally considered one of the better of the 50's Sci Fi movies, When Worlds Collide looks at issues that we still talk about today such as how to deal with planetary bodies coming too close to Earth. A flying Noah's Ark is the answer in this movie. Backed by a private financier--just as there is more talk of the space industry today becoming more privatized. Also, several themes from this movie can be seen running in the more recent ""2012"" movie. In other words, this movie has legs. Like all these great old films you just have to be willing to look past the advances in movie making and special effects since then to enjoy the show. My one criticism for When Worlds Collide is that it is one of the few movies from this time period that could actually been stretched out to a longer running time. Most of these Sci Fi movies in this era run 90 minutes or less. There was plenty left unexplored here, particularly towards the end when the whole escape from Earth to their new home seemed very rushed.",1363564800,,1065,4.438775510204081

  At this time i would like to appeal to other Prime members of AMAZON. I am a prime member now for more than 2 years,
 as you all know it cost members aprrox. $79 per yr. so you can activate the streaming of movies which is really great.
  The only problem im finding is that they are throwing a lot of offbeat type programs in,(boating, political talk, lots of animation and more!). you will not see many classics,, oh, but they are there, you just have to pay a rental fee or actually buy the movie!
  What im suggesting is that we members should either call or write in to Amazon asking if they can throw a few more choice flics our way. For myself, if it keeps going the way it is now, i will not be giving my hard earned $79 dollars in the near future.
  I hope members and non-members have read this thru, if so, I thank you.  Almost forgot... another bad feature they never corrected(and i called them many times on this) is that when you put up the library of films and look thru them, they keep repeating the same movies over and over again, so your not getting a true picture of whats actually there.

245185,4,6300215520,"A curious blend of science fiction and Biblical sensibilities.  Earth is doomed, as it so often is in these types of films; people are hoping to escape the impending disaster in rockets that have yet to be designed or proven worthy of space travel.  However, desperation calls for instant solutions!  The hitch is that not everyone believes there is a problem heading straight for Earth.  Governments want to talk it over first.  Opposing scientists question the veracity of those who discovered the problem (a pesky star on collision course with Earth).  They don't believe the star will even come close.  It's left to a band of believers to come up with an answer.  They hit on the unoriginal idea of an ark.  As luck would have it, there just happens to be a planet orbiting the killer star and hopefully it might be habitable.  Regardless, with a pioneer spirit, they're heading for it!
The problems with this film are minuscule.  There are a few loose plot threads, some questions in logic, and a truly abysmal matte painting at the end.  Other than that, the most intriguing aspect of this film has to do with the social implications, who decides the passenger list?  Why do animals/cargo rate higher than people do?  Why is everyone on board white?  Why only one child (they weigh less therefore more people could be saved)?

245235,4,6300215520,"This movie was a bit long on dialogue but still was worth watching. There was a lot of time devoted to deciding who got to fly to the new world. I found the last ten minutes to be the best, from the time the ""ship"" as it was called was blasted off on what looked like a giant roller coaster track up into the sky. I particularly liked seeing the plane then fall down after it went off the end of the track although it was clear that it was not suppposed to be seen doing that. If you watch closely you will see it.

There were some amusing scenes of passengers strapped in their seats like people in a waiting room with seat belts on. Even though the spaceship
was doing flips and turns and loop de loops the passengers were stiff in their seats like dummies. Not one moved a muscle the entire time. Their chairs looked like beach chairs.

While the ship was being frantically prepared for the flight to the new planet, a loudspeaker continually barked ""hurry! hurry! There is no time to waste! Faster! Work faster!""

But the actual space travel seemed no more eventful than a flight to Hawaii.

I found this movie to be ok and enjoyable as a comparison to what we know now about space travel. We were naive back when this was made and it made this movie fun to watch.
The end of the world wasn't so bad after all if you were lucky enough to be on the ship
to the new world which turned out to be beautiful. The scenes of the final destruction of planet Earth were especially good, particularly the one of New York City being abandoned and flooded.

245238,2,6300215520,"This was made in the same year as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" but from every possible point of view, it's an inferior product. Nonetheless, it won an academy award for best special effects!

They start with a Bible and a reference to the story of Noah. And in fact, religious references are laced throughout the story. Oh, well.

Anyway, we open on an observatory in South Africa which has made some startling discovery. They hire Dave Randall (a cliche womanizer with a pretty girl in his private plane with him) to be the courier that takes the photographic plates to Dr. Hendrin in the US for confirmation. In fact, the black box containing the plates is chained to his arm. Reporters try to bribe him for it, but when Dr. Hendrin's daughter Joyce shows up to escort him and the box, he says he's ""working on a better offer."" Of course, she is beautiful. In the cab ride to the observatory, she assumes Randall already knows what this is about, but he doesn't.

It's about the end of the world. A star named Bellus is headed directly for the earth with its satellite Zyra. Dr. Hendrin wants to build a spaceship as a sort of Noah's ark, and fly it to Zyra, which will pass close to earth and cause major earthquakes and related destruction 11 days before Bellus hits the earth and destroys it. The UN and the US Congress laugh at him, but private capital finances his ship. They get him started, and then crotchety old Mr. Stanton, in his wheelchair, agrees to put up the rest of the money in exchange for being guaranteed a seat on the ship.

Most of the story centers around the project of building the ship and provisioning it. They microfilm books (starting with the Bible), select animals to carry along, and so on. There are over 600 people on the project, but only about 40 can go along. Once several essentials, including Stanton who paid for it and Randall because Joyce is in love with him are counted, the remainder are chosen by lot.

Martial law is declared, and all the people not working on the ship are moved to high ground in anticipation of the flooding which will be caused by Zyra's passing. The special effects for which the academy award was given were undoubtedly for the depiction of the destruction at this point. Randall and the doctor, rivals for Joyce's affections, take a helicopter full of emergency provisions to the nearby refugee camp. On their way back, they spot a little boy tied to a chimney and rescue him. Dr. Hendrin decides to carry him to Zyra with them, and then when he picks up a pregnant dog, she is added to the animal group.

They get the ship loaded in a hurry as soon as the lots which were drawn are announced, partly because Stanton had stashed a bunch of rifles against the possibility of rioting, and the workers who were not chosen found the rifles and started attacking the ship. At the last minute, Dr. Hendrin stays behind, holding Stanton's wheelchair and saying, ""The new world isn't for us. It's for the young."" He points out they may need that extra fuel, and of course it turns out they do.

They land on deep snow on Zyra, but when the door is opened (of course the air is just fine), they behold a beautiful green landscape with pink flowers and a very, very fake looking sunrise and backdrop. I'm not sure the studio even attempted to make it real-looking.

This is not a bad movie for 1951, but it's certainly not up to the standards of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still.""",1337126400,,3444,4.481658692185008

245270,3,6300215520,"WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE (1951) is a quite decent Technicolor PARAMOUNT sci-fier. The female lead is Barbara Rush, a lovely actress who never made it big. Rush married Jeffrey Hunter in 1950, and they were one of Hollywood's handsomest couples.

Top-billed actor is Richard Derr. He started his film career in Charlie Chan mysteries. Derr is another who never caught on. To me he looks like a very tall, very serious Danny Kaye.

The movie's biggest shortcoming is in not delivering the advertised goods. When an invading planet comes too close to Earth, a montage of stock footage is used (bridge collapses, oil rig fires, floods, etc.). Interesting enough, but when that orb's star approaches, we see Earth begin to smolder, and then there's a quick cutaway to outer space. No collision.

This non-explosion probably reflects the paranoias of a post-WWII world in which nuclear weapons were a new reality, and the Soviets, since only 1949, possessors of the atom bomb.

The chintziest moment is a painting employed as the alien vista that greets 40-plus intergalactic travelers who survive a spaceship belly landing on their new home planet.

A Biblical Noah's Ark tie-in opens and ends the film. The menagerie here however is surely much smaller than the one that rode out the Great Flood.

Despite an obvious limited budget and a non-payoff ""collision,"" this picture's well-worth seeing. Its premise, that our globe could at any time cross paths with another planet or sun, is, with countless trillions of objects traveling through the Universe, certainly within the realm of possibility.

Its 1951 special effects were spectacular, plus a great plot, superb acting and produced by the great George Pal, winner of 7 other Academy awards on other movies.  The remastering and coloring and audio on this DVD are superb.

Two worlds, Ziara about the size of our Earth and Belus a giant world come into our solar system heading for a collision course for Earth. A few astronomers discover this and its a race against time to save a small bit of humanity. We see the many other scientists and world leaders who don't believe the Earth's destruction will happen until its almost too late. Will other escape spaceships be created in time?

Ziara causes massive destruction with giant tidal waves flooding cities like NYC, earthquakes and more...billions killed but Ziara misses the Earth.  Flooded NYC with floundered Ocean liners between skyscrapers is creepy. Millions survive the passing of Ziara but 19 days later the giant planet Belus hits Earth and totally destroys it.

About 44 people, animals and supplies are put on a rapidly constructed arc spaceship and blasted to Ziara. We see the love triangle of  a doctor, Tony Randal the assistant spaceship pilot and the head scientist's daughter. A wealthy crippled businessman Stanton in a wheel chair gives the expedition enough money to complete the ships construction. He wants to select the crew but is allowed only to save himself for his money. Wow, is he unpleasantly surprised in the end. I won't ruin the great ending for you.

Dave Randall (Richard Derr) is masculine in a way no longer seen on the screen, and Barbara Rush is feminine, dainty, so lovely- again, a rarity today. The premise, that earth is definitely, no doubt about it, facing obliteration, and the desperate race to build a spacecraft, a Noah's Ark to safely transport a core group of survivors to another planet, is gripping. All the performances are solid, and the only minus is the visuals, two scenes in all, that are plainly just flat boards with scenery painted on. One is the flooded New York City, and the other, the worse of the two, is the finale, when our intrepid survivors step out onto Zyra, their new planet-home. What do they/we see? A vast one-dimensional painting that would give me pause even if I did survive the destruction of Earth! Now that's one weird planet! But because I love the film and the cast, it gets five stars.

Anyway, a runaway star hurls toward earth, but don't worry! It will miss us by that much.....but not the planet it's pulling along with it. Darn.

The effects are top notch for it's day, as they gleefully (I assume) destroy the planet as our plucky bunch of characters try to decide who will attempt the escape by rocket ship. You should watch the movie for any more of the exciting story, as I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. :-)",1298678400,,832,4.361290322580645
245276,5,6300215520,"This storyline about the pending destruction of earth by an approaching comet or meteor has been done several times, but this movie is a perfect example that good acting and good directing does make a difference since in my opinion, ""When Worlds Collide"" is the best of the lot.  The only bad spot of this film was at the end when the crew of the ""Noah's Ark Spaceship"" open the hatch door and see their new planet home.  This was a cheesy painting. If only someone could take this last scene and redo the background painting with something more realistic.  Up until this disappointing painting, the acting, props and special effects were great and made it very easy to like this classic.  This is a very good ""B"" Sci-Fi movie, and I was surprised that after all these years, it still made a positive impression on me.",1293408000,,818,4.54421768707483

245278,3,6300215520,"""When Worlds Collide"" runs just 83 minutes, so it's got that going for it. This cheeseball flick tells a loose story, with the bad guy in a wheelchair, guys and gals digging each other, and a boy and his dog. The subtext, biblical without subtlety, is barely submerged. The physics of planetary trajectories and orbital mechanics must not have had its SAG card, 'cause it's a no show.

On the flipside, the model making, mural painting and general special effects outshine the story. They were pretty impressive for the day and remain not too shabby. See if you can spot Frank Cady, who would go on to play Sam Drucker, proprietor of Drucker's General Store in Hooterville.

Three stars is generous, but WWC deserves more than two.",1289260800,,731,4.748031496062992
245279,2,6300215520,"George Pal was a successful producer of science-fiction and fantasy films. By current standards, most of them aren't very good, particularly in the writing/acting/directing departments (which leaves nothing of any importance). Many were ""B"" films with budgets at the low end of the ""A"" scale. Only ""War of the Worlds"" holds up; it's a less-annoying film than Steven Spielberg's take on the same story.

""When Worlds Collide"" is strictly MST3K fodder. Virtually every scene provokes unintended laughs. ""Hello, I'm Joyce Hendron, the obligatory female romantic interest in what would otherwise be an all-male film."" There's no attempt at any kind of scientific accuracy -- if Bellus were at the stated distance of one billion miles, it would be well-within the Solar system, and plainly visible even in daylight.

The opticals and special effects are generally quite good, with the ""drowning"" of Manhattan under a wall of water fairly believable, even by modern standards. The only groaner is the matte painting of the surface of Zyra, which is cheap and amateurish beyond belief. The ""rays of spiritual glory"" don't help. (It appears that the painting was a ""place-holder"" for an as-yet unbuilt model. However, the film went over so well in previews that the model was never built.)

The script is little more than a compendium of disaster clich&eacute;s, in particular the wealthy industrialist (John Hoyt) who contributes money only after he's guaranteed a seat. The acting is acceptable, with Richard Derr giving a lively and pleasingly cynical performance. Though seated in a wheelchair, Hoyt nevertheless manages to chew most of the scenery (do you expect any less from an Evil Capitalist?), and gets perhaps the biggest laugh when he shoots his toadying assistant to death. When Larry Keating (whom you probably know better as Wilbur Post's neighbor) keeps him from boarding the space ship, you want to cheer. (The scene you would /like/ to see, where Hoyt is pushed off the side of a cliff into a gorge full of cacti, sharp-edged rocks, and iron fences with sharp spikes, is not, unfortunately, in this film.)

""When Worlds Collide"" was apparently shot in three-strip Technicolor. This transfer is taken from a good print (it's not an Ultra Resolution restoration), and has little to apologize for.

This is a great party film, one you're not likely to stop laughing at even after repeated viewings. Strongly recommended -- for all the wrong reasons.",1285200000,,2456,5.13

245332,4,6300215520,"Famous science fiction producer, George Pal (Destination Moon, The War of the Worlds, Conquest of Space, Time Machine, 7 Faces of Dr. Loa), vividly brings to the silver screen an adaptation of the famous 1930s novel, `When Worlds Collide' by Philip Gordon Wylie and Edwin Balmer.  The visual spectacle is quite spectacular (and rightly won an Oscar that year for special effects).  Although the acting is plagued by some pretty atrocious performances (Richard Derr as Randal for example), When Worlds Collide is still an enjoyable film despite being painfully dated and highly flawed.

If anything embodies the 1950s rugged optimistic individualism espoused by Heinlein and the like, When Worlds Collide is a shining beacon.  Especially refreshing (although probably misplaced) is the optimism shown in corporations.  When was the last time a movie plot describes a corporation providing the impetus (in massive amounts of cash) to save the human race?  When have the CEOs of corporations voluntarily given huge sums of money even if they themselves are not going to be the saved?  This bizarre corporate philanthropy is thankfully tempered by Rudolph Mat (the director) with a self-centered CEO who will only give his financial support if he can save his own skin....

A brief plot summary might be useful...
(some spoilers)

The story begins at an observatory in South Africa where Dr. Bronson discovers a extraterrestrial planet circling star careening at ridiculous speeds towards earth and sends the photographs to Dr. Cole Hendron, in America.  The world's politicians don't believe the Hendron's story and with the help of the aforementioned corporations, he embarks on building his own space ship for the purpose of landing on the approaching planet.  Eventually the help of a self-centered, crippled, industrialist Sidney Stanton is needed to complete the craft on time.  A lottery is developed to pick the lucky 44 people from the hundreds and hundreds assisting in the creation of the vessel.

As is often the case, the interesting premise -- the construction of an Ark to save humanity and Earth's various species -- is side stepped for a silly romantic triangle between Hendron's daughter, Joyce, Randall and Drake.  However, Joyce's character is quite interesting since  clearly her father has taught her the ins-and-outs of running an observatory and all the math.  For a female character of the 50s, she seems quite intelligent, although her desire for the unqualified Randall to be among those selected for the flight smacks of complete and utter self-righteousness in the face of the potential destruction of the human race.

Remember, we are not dealing with the realm of hard-science fiction.  The probability of the very planet threatening earth being able to supporting human life is utterly preposterous.  And yes, there's not a single minority among those lucky 44 -- now that I think about it, there's not a single African-American to be seen.

However, we are in it for the ride!  The explosions!  The rocket launch! And, at the end we get to giggle uncontrollable at the painted alien landscape backdrop.... Fun fun fun.  To bad Pal's Conquest of Space was such a commercial disaster for a sequel was in the works....  And with alien landscape backdrops like the one at the end of this film, it would have been worth watching!",1278115200,2,3353,5.1213235294117645
245333,5,6300215520,"This film may be old-fashioned but it's ambitious and successfully conveys an atmosphere of approaching doom. Unlike the tedious 1990s/2000s 'apocalypse' movies which have the Earth threatened with destruction until some annoying hero figure who loves children saves the day (yawn), this one delivers on its quaint, old-fashioned promise and blows the planet to pieces. With modern FX, a remake would be great, maybe one that follows the 1932 novel more closely.",1274918400,,462,5.430555555555555
245334,4,6300215520,"I purchased this film along with Forbidden Planet and This Island Earth.  Forbidden Planet was given the special treatment as a 50th anniversary edition and even though the other two were not they still look good.  The version of this film I got has the earth and a larger red planet crashing together with the rocket as shown in the film escaping the crash.  I enjoy these older films because they make me feel good inside.  They take us back to a simpler time in history when things ""seemed more sane"".  Maybe its my age?  Anyway if you are a film fan and like science fiction you will enjoy this.  The special effects look dated but thats part of the fun.  Try to put yourself back in 1953, turn the lights down, get your favorite snacks and drinks etc. and escape from the morbid reality that is our current day world.

July 27 2013,  I see that they reissued this DVD for 2013.  I hope they remaster it for Blu Ray as it deserves it and should be restored for all time.  War Of The Worlds is not on Blu Ray yet but they restored the Techicolor and it looks great.",1274400000,,1068,4.258706467661692

This is the first great disaster movie and George Pal pulled out all the stops to bring state-of-the-art special effects (Academy award winner) to the big screen.  The story line also holds up.  Modern audiences should find this one easy to watch and the concept of the end of the world by interstellar collision has been retold many times (Armageddon and Deep Impact being the most recent).  But... this is the granddaddy of them all.  There's plenty of tension as a rogue planet heads towards the Earth on a doomsday course.  The attempts of scientists and a wealthy businessman to build an escape rocket are the central theme.

You might call George Pal the C.B. DeMille of Sci Fi movies.  While many folks have become jaded on modern computer generated imagery, this film should still delight most audiences.  The scenes of the first wave of impending disasters look pretty real.  I really enjoyed watching this film.

245394,4,6300215520,"When Worlds Collide is great science fiction. I must have viewed it over a dozen times over the years and I never get tired of watching. Yes, there are scientific flaws; for example, surely the star Bellus would have either crushed or incinerated the Earth weeks before the final day of judgement. But there are more than adequate compensations in the acting, in the plot and the characterization. Richard Derr as the pilot/love interest is really good and Barbara Rush almost as convincing as the scientist/daughter/love interest. Interesting that in 1950 the person who would do the calculations to verify ""the most terrifying discovery of all time"" would be a young woman, given also that later in the film all the engineers and scientists were men and the women were all technicians.
Few reviewers comment on the now""politically correct"" features of the film. The entire crew is white and very young. No black Americans, no hispanics, no one with any kind of accent. While other countries were building their spaceships it becomes clear that the only ship to escape at the end was the American one, from the East coast at that. No scientists in the USSR or in Great Britain with either the science or the money to get in early in the action and commence building? The only scientists capable of seeing the data clearly are Americans; the astronomer who ridicules them at the United Nations is British. When the movie shows the books that will be the basis on which the culture of the new world will be built, there is the Bible, but no Qu'ran. There is ""The Story of Mankind"", but no ""Communist Manifesto"". There are lots of things on practical agriculture (sensible), but no philosophy?  OK, so the film has to tell a story and get it done in 90 minutes, but the lacunae do tell a story in themselves.
But these are quibbles. The film is exceptional in my opinion, created by a great director and it holds up so well over 50 years later, so credit must be given where the credit is really due.",1240012800,,1998,4.660056657223796

The collision course theory could happen for real, just like all the meteorites are happening every day, just imaging a little bit bigger !
From an astronomy stand point the story line is accurate, the launch pad for the rocket though isn't but remember it was back in 1951, so overall the story is good and believable, but maybe not for the general audience who has seen Armageddon in the meantime, the true Science Fiction lovers will enjoy this very good movie, with a great cast, and pretty good special effects of tsunami, volcanoes and so on, at least for a 1951 movie.
The picture quality is great, perfect, but only in Fullscreen though, and the sound is all right but only mono, remember old movie. The Technicolor is perfect as well and it is a pleasure to watch, the DVD menu is nice but the extra feature is limited to only the trailer, nothing else(Paramount classic).

Nuclear war, a VERY real threat then, didn't cause me any worry. But the thought of being smashed to atoms by another pool ball from outerspace did. I always wondered would I be calm and accept my fate or scratch and claw my way for one more minute of existence like the others?

Considering the budget and the state of special effects at the time, this color film was marvelously done. The ""new"" planet looks like a joke with orange sky and purple trees BUT, whaddya want for nuthin???? Rubber Bisket? Most of the acting is done by unknowns and is spot on. I hear a remake is in the works and this makes me sad. Almost as sad as when I first viewed the film and realized that NONE of the survivors picked looked like me. But that was a different time.

Special effects are ludicrous. Oil-painted canvas as background scenarios; a butane lighter as rocket engine. Acting lines are poor (except for the memorable: ""You are scientific crackpots! Nothing will happen!""). On top of that, lip-locked kisses, and the absurd amount of cigarettes.

Its sci-fi concepts are beyond illogical, even for the genre criteria: a settler-rocket flying into a zooming Terran planet that crushes Earth, not to mention the life-saving lottery in which the doctor's daughter and her boyfriend are absurdly left hors-concour. The overt references to the Bible are amusing, as well as the long show-off scene of a first-generation helicopter. More seriously, the complete absence of African-Americans actors must be noted.

""When Worlds Collide"" kicked off the wave of sci-fi (and horror) movies expressing anxieties over a Nuclear Holocaust during the emerging Cold War. The approaching planet is red, red, red. As interestingly, the movie also anticipates the white exodus from the city towards suburbia.

245488,4,6300215520,"This 1951 film is a minor classic in the history of science fiction films.

The film has tended to be overlooked as it came out the same year as The Day the Earth stood still (which IS a better film). But if you look back prior to 1951 there is really only Metropolis which stands out.

The title explains everything about the plot. A passing planet is going to pass near the Earth and cause chaos, however it will be closely followed by its star which will destroy the Earth. A team of scientists have to build a Rocket to take a selected few from the Earth so that the human race can survive. This provides a lot of opportunities for various sub-plots about the morality of who should get a place on the Rocket.

Its only real flaw is the science, where the film just doesn't add up! For example when the star is getting very close this doesn't seem to raise the temperature on Earth all.....

The special effects now look incredibly primitive, but for the time they were brilliant. In 1951 at the Cinema, this film, which is in colour must have been absolutely stunning for the audience at that time. You might want to see it first before buying, but for me it is a milestone movie of its day.",1180483200,,1196,4.325892857142857

Besides Barbara, this movie's good points are it's thoughful plot with good characterizations and conflicts. It's a successful blend of exposition and adventure. And, it's a good procedural for the ending of the world.

A lot of the thoughfulness was inherited from the British novel it was based on. But the novel was less colorful than the movie, so I'm glad for this incarnation.

245582,3,6300215520,"Dave Randall (Richard Derr) brings news to Dr. Cole Hendron (Larry Keating), Astronomer at Cosmos Observatory that the Earth will be destroyed by collision with the star Bellus(Latin for War) A space ship is hastily built by private funding to allow 44 people, chosen by lottery, escape by ""20th.

As the selected prepare to escape from the Earth,  Hendon pulls a shock move, literally at the last second and we see something that also happened in Dr. Strangelove with Peter Sellers: Sellers was funny, but in this film it was one of the creepiest chilhood memories!

The technicolor is good and used to great effect for the mood of doom and it's nice to see Barbara Rush in colour. As with the better 1950s sci-fi ""When Worlds Collide"" has a storyline and not just special effects.

Another dramatic effect as an idea that could have been adapted from the ticking clock motif in ""High Noon"" to give a sense of urgency and this is the count-down calender on the wall numbering the days to the arrival of Zyra and then Bellus.

245584,3,6300215520,"Hollywood has not done well when it comes to movies about celestial objects hitting the Earth.  I had seen the poorly done ""Meteor"", and the comically bad ""Armageddon"" and was warned away from ""Deep Impact"" (although I am sure I will eventually see it), but for some reason I had never seen the one which started it all.  ""When Worlds Collide"" was released in August of 1951, shortly before ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", and while it too suffers from some bad science, it is a much better movie than the more recent efforts.

This movie was based on a book of the same name by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer which was first published in 1932.  I have not yet read the book, so I cannot comment on differences in the story.  In the movie, the premise is that a star (Bellus) and its Earth sized planet (Zyra) are heading towards Earth, with Bellus being on a collision course.  The movie starts with one scientist sending his data to be confirmed to another group of scientists.  After they confirm the results, they attempt to warn the rest of the world, but are dismissed by the rest of the scientific community as publicity seekers.  They do manage to convince some business men to contribute a lot of money in an attempt to build a space ship to act as a kind of Noah's Ark to take about 40 people to Zyra in an attempt to save the human race.

As I indicated, the science part of the movie is pretty poor.  The passing of the planet Zyra causes great earthquakes and damage to the Earth as it should, and yet somehow the Earth remains quiet and still even when Bellus is closer to the Earth than Zyra, allowing a successful last minute launch.  The drawing of lots to choose the people who are to survive is also ridiculous, as clearly they would want people with the proper skills to survive and build a new civilization.  Even the initial ability to determine that Bellus would collide with our planet isn't good science, as Bellus is described as being 12 times the size of Earth, which would make it quite small compared to our Sun.  Thus the gravitational force of our Sun would undoubtedly alter its path considerably as it approached.  There are also the combined effects of all the other celestial bodies in our system, which would make such a determination impossible.

The movie was produced by George Pal, who also produced ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953), and Cecil B. DeMille, though uncredited, was the executive producer.  Rudolph Mat directed the film.  The special effects are pretty good for their time, and in fact Gordon Jennings won the Oscar in 1952 for Best Effects, Special Effects for his work on this film.  One area which didn't work though was at the end of the film on the planet Zyra where it was completely fake and unrealistic.  The other Oscar nomination this movie received was John F. Seitz and W. Howard Greene for Best Cinematography, Color.  There are plans to make a newer version of this story, which is currently scheduled for 2008.  Let us hope they draw more from the original than they do from the more recent films.

The DVD offers only the trailer for an extra, and there isn't even a booklet or sheet listing the chapters.  It is a shame this movie didn't receive the same treatment that ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" received when it was released on DVD.  As one of the earlier science fiction films, it clearly has had a large impact on the genre.",1154476800,6,3403,4.513866231647635

Astronomers learn of a star heading towards the solar system. It is on a collision course with earth and the earth will be destroyed. At first, nobody believes the predictions except for a few true believers and a nasty billionaire who is very protective of his own skin. The true believes conceive of a plan to build a space ship to take a few individuals to the planet of the incoming star and save a remnant of humanity.

As the star gets closer, more and more people come to realize that the doomsayers were right all along. The earth is doomed and only a very few can be saved. Those that will be saved are chosen by lottery from those who worked on the escape ship.

Its no secret: the earth is destroyed. Very few get away.

The strong points of this film are the moral and physical courage shown by the characters. There are a few scoundrels but this piece dates from the day and age when virtue is rewarded and deceit is punished. Although the situations can be hokey and the effects are laughable by today's standards, the film has a charm all its own. It is first rate.",1146355200,8,1243,4.344827586206897
245620,4,6300215520,"It's the end of the world, 1950s style. A whirling pair of planets descend on poor little earth from deep space. One has a trajectory that will mash the world like an egg dropped on concrete. The other, however, appears capable of supporting life, so off we go. Valiant scientists and derring-doers are off to save the day, and even a venal financier is bullied into doing the right thing to save the human species. Then, they're off in their shiny rocket with big fins, and the requisite happy ending ensues.

This is a 1950s artifact, though. That was a nice-looking little planet that just showed up, ready to move into, with everything but the white picket fences - not what I would have expected after a few eons near absolute zero in interstellar space. A character in a wheelchair had to fit some stereotype, either the tear-jerker or the guy with a moral sense as broken as his body - the latter stereotype was used here. The human race is saved, but with a strikingly low percentage (zero?) of brown and black faces on Noah's new ark. Well, maybe not the whole human race was being saved, just the parts that mattered back then.

The original book had a lot more to say about how the world would behave, when most people knew that there was no tomorrow in which they'd be call to account for their actions today. The movie sensibility of the 1950s could not tolerate so dark a view of the human spirit. After the serious part of the book was scraped off, only a popcorn movie was left.

So be it. Pop that corn and enjoy it.

But the point of this kind of film is about expressing the spirit of science fiction, the flat out incredible nature of the crisis and how people respond. No, it's not at all realistic, but who cares? It's a great little film even with all it's supposed flaws.

I've read the books and thoroughly enjoyed them. I still like the film even after reading them. The whole idea of science fiction in that day, just as with 1950's ""Destination Moon"", an equally ridiculous film if you listen to the detractors, was to entertain people with the ""idea"" of ""what if"" supposition.

Critics of these kinds tend to be exactly the opposite with more modern fare, thinking films like ""Red Planet"" and ""The Astronaut's Wife"" are great art because they have a more realistic depiction of space and space ships and alien terrains, but lack the essentials of good story telling.

I find the incredible lack of imagination that goes into modern science fiction films to be disturbing to say the least. Films like ""When Worlds Collide"" stimulate the imagination to think beyond the possible and to embrace the impossible.

Who didn't like ""Armaggedon""? It was completely ridiculous. But I loved it because it didn't take itself too seriously and the pile of improbable events and ""They would never do that"" moments could make the film unwatchable to the critical eye.

So a film like this to be compared with ""When Worlds Collide"" is valid because both films not only dealt with impending doom of humankind, but also used, in practical terms, improbable solutions to save humanity. Hurrah for the imagination.

245625,4,6300215520,"Based upon the 1933 novel by Edwin Balmer (1883-1959) and Philip Wylie (1902-1971), ""When Worlds Collide"" was adapted to film in 1951 under the direction of Rudolph Mat (1898-1964) and with a budget of approximately $936,000.  (By comparison in the same year, this was only slightly less than the budget used for ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", but a small fraction of the $7,000,000 budget spent for ""Quo Vadis"").  The story begins at a remote observatory where the eminent astronomer, Dr. Emery Bronson (Hayden Rorke, 1910-1987) discovers that a rogue star with its orbiting planet (that he names Bellus and Zyra respectively) may be on a collision course with Earth.  In absolute secrecy, Dr. Bronson sends his horrific data to his colleague Dr. Cole Hendron (Larry Keating, 1896-1963) in New York via the leather-jacketed, ace pilot & courier Dave Randall (Richard Derr, 1918-1992).  With the assistance of his daughter Joyce Hendron (Barbara Rush), Dr. Hendron analyzes Dr. Bronson's data on the ""Differential Analyzer"" (an old-fashioned analog computer) and confirms the trajectories of Bellus and Zyra.  Dr. Hendron confers with other scientists and world leaders to ask them to build rockets to ferry as many people, animals and plants as possible away from the doomed Earth and to a new home on Zyra.  (The similarity to the Judeo-Christian myth of Noah's ark is obvious.)  However, the findings fall on deaf ears, except for the aging, wheelchair-bound millionaire Sydney Stanton (John Hoyt, 1905-1991), who agrees to fund the building of a single rocket that can take just over 40 passengers as long as he has a seat.  The film follows the construction of the rocket, the devastating effects that the gravity of Zyra and Bellus have upon Earth as they approach, and the impact that the impending doom has upon the social structure.

For a film that was made long before computer-generated special effects existed, the special effects used in ""When Worlds Collide"" are effective and entertaining.  It's especially fun to see how people in the early 1950's envisioned the types of technology that could be used to travel into space years before any nation had created an actual space program or trained any astronauts. Though the science used in the film was flawed and film's meager budget prevented a more realistic vision of a Zyran landscape, neither seriously adversely affects the film-watching experience.  Overall, I rate the 1951 ""When Worlds Collide"" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to any sci-fi aficionado.",1098316800,232,2542,5.1012048192771084

The movie is an adaptation of the original novel from 1933, and retains some of the best dramatic elements of the book:
the marauding objects are first visible only in the southern hemisphere, putting them out of view of the civilization that has the ability to address the need for escape;
those who won't get to escape attack, threatening the survival of anyone (in the movie, those who won't get to go attack to try and go; in the book, those who just want to survive attack the camp for its obvious supplies of food)
I saw the movie long before I read the book, and there are some inferior elements in the movie, some of which stretch credulity.  The book posits a Jupiter-like object and its Earth-like companion, ripped away from their own star, marauding through, the larger object devastating the Earth and returning eight months later to destroy Earth.  At that point, the arks leave Earth to make the quick jump to the smaller object which breaks free and orbits our Sun.  The larger object heads out into interstellar space, bearing the remnants of Earth.
In the movie, it would have made more sense to leave Earth right before or right after Zyra devastates Earth (and one wonders why Earth didn't rip up Zyra's surface at the same time), rather than wait until Bellus is almost upon Earth.
If Zyra remains orbiting Bellus, then Earth would get fried as Bellus approaches, and the Ark would have to fight Bellus' gravity as it flies out to Zyra.  Even the movie could have told us (but didn't even hint one way or another) that Zyra goes into orbit around our sun while Bellus takes out Earth.
Ignoring all this faulty astronomical set-up, the movie is a suspenseful story about the attempt to overcome technology and make a space flight when even a manned orbital flight has never been done.  At first, people like Stanton have to be goaded into financing something they don't believe in, while people close to and who trust Hendron give willingly.
For a better feel of the story, I recommend reading the novel.  The grammar and syntax are dated, but understandable, and you get to know the characters' origins.  There is a sequel, After Worlds Collide, with more modern syntax and grammar.
Until about the 1990s, When Worlds Collide would have been grand as a movie remake, positing even a one-way shuttle flight to the new planet to scout it out.  Even today, a creative adaptation would be welcome if it sticks to the original story's astronomical setup.",1088812800,10,2622,4.697167755991285
245628,5,6300215520,"Before Deep Impact and Armageddon, there was When Worlds Collide.
Astronomers in South Africa--one played by Hayden Rorke, who went on the play Dr. Bellows in 'I Dream of Jeannie'--discover a star is on a collision course with Earth.  Along with associates in America, most notably Larry Keating, in the role of Dr. Hendron, they try to convince a skeptical world that doomsday is just around the corner.
Unable to convince the world of the coming calamity, they set to work in building a rocket of salavation--to fly to what they believe is a habitable planet circling the star eventually named Zyra (the planet, they name Bellus).  The rocket building is funded by a meglomaniac wheelchair-bound millionaire name Sydney Stantion--played wonderfully wicked by character actor John Hoyt.  You also have Frank Cady, looking very young yet still very bald, who went on to greater fame in Green Acres.
As doomsday draws nearer, the rest of the world becomes convinced of what is to happen.  As Hendon put it early in the movie, ""Even a layman will be able to see the danger.""
I didn't really find Richard Derr convincing as ladies' man Dave Randall.  He was just a little too much Howdy Doody in the face to pull it off.  The lovely Barbara Rush play Dr. Hendon's daughter, Joyce, and Randall's eventual love interest.  By the way...a little Trek trivia here...Barbara Rush was the real-life wife of actor Jeffrey Hunter, who played Captain Christopher Pike in the original Star Trek pilot in 1964 (ultimately played by Shatner, of course).
The story does manage to build some tension, but the film is more genre than epic.  There are some nice scenes, such as the U.N. scene (they must have spent some money on that) and closeups of the rocket.  Unfortunately, the effects fall apart upon landing on Bellus.  Obviously, they ran short of money at the end and had to settle on some hokey-looking painted backgrounds.
Overall, a very good movie whose premise has been copied time again in the decades since.",1076716800,6,2003,4.847507331378299
245689,3,6300215520,"The production values in this movie are not bad, given its age. I mean, the use of models, stock footage and artwork is painfully obvious in places, but the photography is decent and it's in TECHNICOLOR!  So while the effects are primitive by today's standards, they're pretty good for the era.  Where the movie falls down, in my opinion, is the sappy overt religiosity and the hammy acting.  And the ""flight scenes"" near the end are just pathetic; the passengers just sit there with no indication that they are in an accelerating (or even moving) spaceship.  They look like they're sitting in a bus ... a PARKED bus!  Still, I have to give this movie 3 stars just because it looks good in places and it captures the feel of an era.  If a runaway star had entered our solar system in 1951, this is probably the way events would have unfolded. And the quality of the images on the DVD edition is quite nice, with rich, saturated colors. Definitely worth watching if you keep your expectations realistic.",1067126400,17,1002,4.601123595505618

245691,5,6300215520,"I had always wanted to see this flick as a kid after seeing numerous stills from it in the Sci-fi & monster magazines. Now, 20 some odd years later I finally picked it up sight unseen and definitely was not dissappointed. I'll try my best to not drop a spoiler here, but I was pretty satisfied with the ending of this flick....well.....for the most part. Anyone who's seen this can likely tell you it's not a happy, happy, joy, joy ending overall, but then again it kinda is....and ..uh....isn't......well, you need to watch this and see what I mean and decide for yourself.
In WWC, the suspense is structured pretty darn good. It's the (what is now) usual, Scientists discover something headed towards earth and they proceed to warn the world scenario that kicks this flick off. In this case, to the ridicules of the United Nations and the world at large. The premise that independent money funds the enormous ""Arks"" that the mocking nations initially refuse to build is an interesting one that still, even today, doesn't seem that far fetched. Obviously due to this films age, some of it comes off rather dated (heck, it *IS* from the 50's!). Another reviewer had mentioned that there were only Caucasians picked for the Ark, and it's true. A sign of the times, but if you can overlook that bit as well as some of the other holes in the story, the film is otherwise quite an enjoyable ride. But it probably will work its magic best with those of us with them back in the day 50's movie fetishes;-)
The special effects are pretty cool considering this film's age. But despite the Oscar it had gotten for the SPFX, this film WILL look rather cheesy to some of the hard core digital FX junkies. The effects aren't awful, in fact they are state of the art 50's style.....but they cannot be compared to modern films. So keep that in mind. But put yourself in the seat as a 50's audience member and you'll likely be dazzled by the experience. The scenes of destruction still felt pretty intense within the context of this movie.
THE PRINT ON THIS DVD: I was quite happy with this transfer considering this is the first time I'd ever seen this flick. I couldn't tell you if it was the worse of others that might be available, but it DEFINITELY outshines the DVD transfer used in Pal's other flick WAR OF THE WORLDS, which was grainy throughout. There were parts here that were beautifully crisp, intermingled with some grainy parts of the film, but overall, I found it quite vivid and quite acceptable. This FELT & LOOKED like Technicolor to me. The ""Special Features"" suck, considering the price. I mean, there's gotta be a George Pal documentary or short that they could've stuck in here. In this, we are treated to the theatrical trailer....woohoo! There's also ""Scene Selection"" which is no more a special feature than the table of contents in a book. Don't stretch yerself there Paramount, we'd hate for ya took look like you care about your films or understand why the DVD format is supposed to be fun to collect.
Luckily, I was able to overlook this lacking  DVD package thanks to the film being quite enjoyable.",1066089600,4,3114,4.620938628158845
245692,5,6300215520,"The DVD's been out a while and I finally got it. This is a worthy film on many levels; as one reviewing predecessor said, there was no baggage to bring along: it could be as new and daring as it wanted to be. Certainly, this is unsettling in its premise, and, in 1951, probably freaked everyone out. I saw it about 10 years later as a little kid and was seriously affected by its message. That final scene of the rocket launch has been repeatedly referred to in most SciFi anthologies. I don't know the work of Rudolph Mate, the director, but he kept things going at a swell pace. The script and editing were appropriate, also, to keep interest. As in all SciFi films, one's thoughts must be provoked and tension should be created. ""When Worlds Collide"" has every element of great SciFi. The cast was well chosen. Richard Derr was solid as the lead character, delivering some goofy lines so they didn't sound as goofy as they were. Great confidence, though I've seen him in a few Outer Limits episodes and not much more. Barbara Rush is customarily concerned, and John Hoyt is wonderfully hammy as the bad rich guy. Hayden Rorke (""I Dream of Jeannie"") and Frank Cady (Sam Drucker in ""Green Acres""/""Petticoat Junction"") found success on TV. Cady in particular was fun to watch, in retrospect. This won the Oscar for Special Effects in 1951. The previous year, ""Destination: Moon"", another George Pal production won that award, and two years later Pal won again for ""War of the Worlds"". When onethinks back to that era, if you can imagine, it must've been wonderful to see this kind of entertainment for the first time. 50+ years later, I'm as comfortably entertained as ever, probably more so. Though much of the special effect footage was done with ""fake"" looking artwork (by the brilliant Chesley Bonesteil), it all worked for me. References to Biblical stuff (the Ark) were not entirely inappropriate. All in all, ""When Worlds Collide"" belongs in the film library of every serious SciFi afficianado.",1058572800,7,2001,4.752873563218391

245694,5,6300215520,"When Worlds Collide was (albeit loosely) based on the novel by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer, first published back in 1932.  George Pal (who became known as the best producer of SF genre films of the 1950s) produced this film after his highly successful ""Destination Moon"".  The cast was comprised mainly of unknowns, probably to save money, only Barbara Rush and John Hoyt (who played the nasty industrialist Stanton to the hilt).  going on to moderately successful film careers. Or you might notice Frank Cady, as Stanton's assistant, who later became well-known in the 1960s TV shows ""Petticoat Junction"" and ""Green Acres"", playing the same character in both shows, or a very young Stuart Whitman in a bit part.
The recently released DVD was long overdue, as the film has been restored to what I can only imagine was the original Technicolor clarity and hue of it's theatrical release.  As has been pointed out, the film was a product of it's time (for instance, there are only <gasp!> white people on the space Ark).  But if you keep in mind when the film was made, and the structure of American society at the time, such details, so politically incorrect today, fall into the irrelevancy they deserve.
Also, I don't think this was Pal's effort to do some kind of nuclear holocaust allegory, as some have suggested.  Pal was a deeply religious man, and this was reflected to varying degrees in all of his films, and after seeing this movie many times, I lean more towards it being a truly Biblical ""end of the world"" story, rather than the more common 1950's ""atomic doom"" sort, although he was certainly cognizant of this angle (see his version of ""The Time Machine"").  As usual, Pal got an Oscar for special effects (nearly all of his movies did).
The acting is good in spots, stiff in others.  I have never seen Richard Derr (David Randall, the pilot) in anything else, but always felt he played his character quite believably and well in WWC.  The story starts slow, but picks up with the flow of events leading up to the launch of the space Ark to the new world.
Technically, the film was fairly accurate for it's time, with a few scientific holes you could fly their spaceship through.  But then the book upon which the movie was based had the same issues.  Master space artist Chesley Bonestell's fingerprints were all over this one, as was his excellent artwork.  Yes, I know some complain about that last matte shot at the end of the movie, showing the new world's landscape, but I think both Pal and Bonestell intended for it to have that ""stylized"" look, and if you are not out to pick nits, I think they pulled it off.  The DVD version of When Worlds Collide deserves a place of honor in any SF movie aficionado's collection.",1049673600,81,2741,4.650103519668737
245695,4,6300215520,"Whether you love or hate this movie -- for it tends to polarize people --  depends largely on how much you believe in its central tenet: mankind is destined to leave the Earth to colonize other parts of the universe. Just to be perfectly clear, we are not talking about a brief space voyage and return to Earth, but irrevokably leaving our cradle. Those that grew up on ""Star Trek"" and ""2001"" are very familiar with this theme; but this movie was the pioneer. (This concept was greatly developed by the late Krafft Ehricke, who referred to it as the ""Extraterrestrial Imperative."")
The special effects are of course dated, but I found a certain charm in them.
Oh, yes -- there is one more noteworthy thing: the spaceship (or space-ark) is guided down a long incline before being redirected to a more vertical path at launch. There is actually some merit to this scheme. Because rockets are extremely inefficient when standing still or moving slowly, is is highly desirable to get them as fast as possible through this fuel-robbing phase. This principle of ""launch assist"" has been used in practice, but never on large vehicles. (The thinking is that the added complexity and risk are not worth it for large vehicles.) Incidentally, the idea of an acceleration ramp was first proposed by that great space pioneer Tsiolkovsky.",1048723200,5,1324,4.832599118942731
245696,3,6300215520,"When Worlds Collide has it all; romance, conflict, spaceships, science fiction and the end of the world. Although Irwin Allen  is credited as the creator of the disaster film (I'll give Allen credit for tweaking the genre), George Pal came up with the blueprint with this interesting but dated science fiction classic. Based on Philip Wyle's classic early science fiction novel, the plot is fairly simple: astronomers discover that a large body is moving through space towards the Earth. As if that wasn't enough, Earth will be pulverized by the first body and knocked out of its orbit. A second body will follow the first. This second rogue planet might actually be inhabitable.
It's decided that an ark to save samples of humanity and our flora and fauna will be launched to this second world. Veteran director Rudolph Mate and producer George Pal manage to create considerable drama and tension from the conflict between those who are going to be saved and those who must stay behind to die (if the plot sounds familiar that's because Deep Impact borrowed large chunks).
The optical effects are cutting edge for the time the film was made. The only drawback is the final image of the colonist new home; a panoramic shot of the new world looks fake. Given the high quality of the other effects it's rather surprising until you learn that it was a temporary effect. Originally Pal had planned for an elaborate miniature to be constructed. Once the film was completed, Paramount decided that the film didn't need the miniature at all and nixed plans after a successful sneak preview of the film.
Pal always regretted not being able to add the final touch to the film. Unfortunately, it mars an otherwise fine conclusion to an early science fiction classic.",1048291200,6,1756,4.8533333333333335
245697,4,6300215520,"Producer George Pal's film 'When Worlds Collide' (1951), as directed by Rudolf Mate, began as the first of a two-volume novelistic sequence written in 1932 by co-writers Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer; they turned out a sequel two years later, as 'After Worlds Collide.' Together, the two novels tell the story of how astronomers detect two extra-solar bodies entering our home system in such a way that one of them will collide with and destroy the earth while the other (a sort of habitable moon of its much larger primary) will assume the earth's orbit. Against both elite and popular incredulity, farsighted men in the industrial nations undertake to build spaceships capable of leaving the earth and landing on the new planet, in so doing to preserve a small number of human beings. In the novelistic version of the story, the plot is complicated by rivalry between the free and the totalitarian nations to rescue a representative sample of their respective societies (and so to reproduce those societies in new circumstances); once the survivors have alighted on the new world, the old conflicts must at last to be worked through to their uncompromising conclusion. The Americans and British use atomic power to wipe out the Soviets, who only just fail to wipe out the Americans and British. Pal's film avoids the political element and concentrates on events in the first of the two linked stories. This was Pal's second essay in medium-budget Technicolor science fiction for the silver screen, the earlier effort having been 'Destination Moon' (1949), where, as a matter of fact, the producer does not avoid an overtly anti-communist theme. The movie begins at an observatory in South Africa, where Dr. Sven Bronson has made the fateful discovery. A courier, Dave Ransdell, has accepted the commission to bring the photographic plates to Bronson's colleague in New York. The colleague, Dr. Cole Hendron, plans to take the facts before the United Nations. When he does, the world's leaders scoff, but a few supporters offer their help to Hendron to build his proposed 'Space Ark.' Bronson and Hendron have made the prediction that the large body, 'Bellus,' will pass close to earth in its penultimate orbit before the catastrophic collision, causing a variety of destructive geological and climatic effects. Disbelief ends when the close passage occurs, and more or less destroys organized civilization. Those involved on the 'Space Ark' project must now complete their task in a short period of time. They must also contend with disaffection from the majority among them who lose out in the last-minute lottery that will decide which forty souls out of many hundreds will find a place in the lifeboat. The scenes of destruction accompanying the first, non-fatal, contact with 'Bellus' are done in fine, convincing miniature, for the most part. The vista of a flooded New York City, with ocean liners tossed up against wrecked towers, is one of the mattes photographed by process specialist Farciot Edouart. The take-off of the 'Ark' represents another instance of fine miniature work. The conceit is that the colossal, winged spaceship rolls down a sloping track to gain speed. It's bad science (what you gain in going down you lose the moment when you need to go up, so you might as well start by going up!) but it's a neat image. The actual collision of the worlds is less spectacular than it might have been. The production apparently used up its budget before truly effective concluding scenes could be filmed. The final shot - of the pioneers disembarking from their vessel on the new world - uses a backdrop painted by renowned astronomical artist Chesley Bonnestell in his prime. It is beautiful, but once again one suspects that Pal originally had richer effects in mind than these. It is worth noting the players: Ransdell is Richard Derr, who takes on the role with panache (Derr played character roles until the 1980s ' he died in 1991); Dr. Bronson is Hayden Rorke, who became a regular on 'I Dream of Jeannie' in the role of Colonel Bellows, the base psychiatrist; Dr. Hendron is Larry Keating, later to fill the part as Wilbur Post's irate neighbor on 'Mr. Ed.' The lovely Barbara Rush (of 'Perry Mason' notoriety) provides the romantic interest, as Joyce Hendron. (The novel calls her 'Eve.) Peter Hanson, as Tony Drake, competes with Derr for Rush's attention; Derr gets her, but Drake is not a sore loser. John Hoyt plays the corrupt businessman, Sidney Stanton, who will pay for the 'Ark' but wants it for himself. Frank Cady, the zealous mortgage-banker from 'Petticoat Junction,' plays Hoyt's resentful assistant, Mr. Ferris. Beware of watching 'When Worlds Collide' late at night. The nostalgia equivalent of DNA splicing can open up bizarre plot-hybrids: I once had a REM-sleep nightmare in which the equine Mr. Ed shot his way on board a flying steam locomotive just at the moment when a vast tidal wave swept over the barn. In fact, 'When Worlds Collide' is superb sci-fi fare, despite the production limitations dogging the final sequence. The dialogue is mainly serious, the acting is competent, and the story is compelling. It's a much better film than either 'Armageddon' or 'Deep Impact,' despite four decades of technical progress in special effects. One reason is that Pal and Mate see no reason to spare the earth; they follow Wylie and Balmer in letting it be obliterated. The release is unfortunately not reproduced in full aspect, but is cropped, pan-and-scan style, to fit a standard television screen. This is too bad, given the spaciousness of the scenic design. Nevertheless, the DVD is worth owning.",1047513600,3,5645,5.0

245740,3,6300215520,"Armageddon has been used often in print and on the screen. The difference between the more memorable attempts like WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE and the more recently forgettable ones like ARMAGEDDON and DEEP IMPACT lies not in special effects but in special relations.  In the latter two end-of-the-world films, the viewer is treated to marvelous special effects which serve as a distraction that helps the viewer overlook the paucity of believable interaction among the characters. In WWC, the characters are not one-dimensional cut outs who simply go crazy under the stress of impending doom, but they react in unpredictable ways as that doom causes them to bounce off one another such that their inner fears and hopes are brought to clarity.
  The doom is an approaching asteroid, and given the recent publicity of such a danger, the modern audience is likely to overlook the cheesy special effects right out of Flash Gordon and focus attention on how individuals think and act under crisis.  As the world learns of the impending collision, the majority of the earth's population reacts in predictable ways, first ridicule, and then when the abstract idea of death is replaced by its unmistakeable reality, fear and chaos result.
This external chaos in the outer world is mirrored in the internal world of the launch site where a group of scientists and workers labor to save a tiny fraction of their number.  A lottery is held to determine who will be chosen.  It is at this point that director Rudolph Mate exposes some truly ugly points about what lurks beneath the skin.  There is one slimy character in the film, a rich but crippled industrialist who provides the money to build the spaceship, but on condition that his money buy him passage.  It is beside the point that he is mean, arrogant, and reprehensible.  The unspoken message of his character is that once one overlooks his money and his crippled body, he is seen as no different from the majority of those who were not lucky enough to be chosen as passengers.  In fact, even the head scientist who was initially presented as the Noble But Misunderstood Leader is himself exposed as a rulebreaker; he prevents the crippled industrialist from boarding at the last moment.  Moments before the launch, the mass of workers who were not chosen shout that the lottery was unfair, so they grab weapons to force entry into the ship.  The only source of basic human decency occurs when one man who was chosen volunteers his winning ticket to his wife who was not.  Interestingly enough, aside from a minor focus on the film's predictable lovers, almost nothing is known or shown about the other lucky passengers who get to exit earth.  They are passive puppets who board when told.  The audience, after having been exposed to the depths of horror that Ordinary Folks fall under stress, must be thinking that this group is no better than the rest, only luckier.  At the end, when the ship lands on the new world, and the survivors emerge to confront a clearly phony painting that is supposed to represent the new world, then the viewer can see that the phoniness of the painting is matched by the phoniness of the survivors.",1025136000,7,3172,4.813996316758748
245741,4,6300215520,"An entertaining reflection of its time. The movie's centerpiece is its special effects, which are mostly effective, with the wall of water crashing down Wall St. canyons the biggest standout. A no-name cast performs capably enough, with Larry Keating of "" The Burns and Allen Show"" getting a featured role, ditto the always menacing John Hoyt, and on her way to bigger and better parts, the ever luscious and sparkling Barbara Rush.
Like many sci-fi movies of the period, WWC is strongly influenced by the very real prospects of nuclear annihilation, prospects which tapped into strong undercurrents of fear running through screenplays and audiences alike. Here annihilation takes the form of a planetary collision that dooms all earth and its creatures to fiery death. The message to audiences of the time appears to be a comforting one. Not to worry, because no matter how devastating the apocalypse, the God-fearing will survive. This time on a space age ark that will transport them to a new life on an Earth-like planet, where gifted white people will build a new Eden. Whatever the viewer' s opinion of such fairy tale endings, the underlying values very much mirror the temper of the time, making this film of genuine interest to cultural research.
My one real complaint comes at movie's end, with the backdrop drawing depicting the Edenic landscape of the new planet.

245744,3,6300215520,"Although WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE was a seminal 1950s special effects movie, the movie has not held up very well with the passage of time. The prophetic story from the famous novel is interesting--a great deal more interesting, really, than a number of 1990s films that use the same general theme: when a roaming planet lines up on a crash course with planet earth, the brightest minds of the planet band together to create a space ship that will carry them to the safety of a second planet associated with crash-course first.  Will this second planet be habital?  Will it, as they hope, assume an orbit around the sun?
The trouble with the film is that the famed special effects--and they are pretty good, too--are clumped up in the middle and at the end of the story.  In the meantime, we are stuck in a story about a very nasty but ultra-rich man who funds the spaceship on the condition that he be accepted as a passenger.  Well, we can all guess how that is going to work out--and just about everything else in the ""between bouts of special effects"" story line, which doesn't really amplify any of its more interesting possibilities.
Fans of 1950s movie science fiction will certainly want to include it in their collection, and almost every one will enjoy seeing the film at least once.  But with its excitement dimmed with the passage of years, once will be enough for most.",1008115200,15,1376,4.622950819672131

That's the day I became hooked on Sci-Fi.  23 years and 3000+ books later, I still am.  This is the movie that really started it all for me.
The DVD is short on special features, but the transfer quality is great, and the sound in good. Sure it's dated.  Yea, the color is off. But it's still enjoyable.",1003536000,5,601,4.228070175438597
245746,2,6300215520,"I'm not sure how long George Pal worked on this one, but it's not too good. It lacks credibility.  Some of the SFX are good, others are appalling...like the view of the ""new Earth""...clearly a water color matte painting. Also, did George Pal ACTUALLY believe that the people of the Earth would submit to a ""lottery drawing"" as to ""who can go and who can't"" without a single protest until the very end? HARDLY BELIEVABLE.",1001980800,2,420,4.6
245747,4,6300215520,"When Worlds Collide is one of the movies that reminds us that the 1950s was more than a decade of giant, mutant bug movies.  It gave us some truly pioneering, serious and high-quality works, including Destination: Moon, Forbidden Planet and, of course, When Worlds Collide.  This film is far more intelligent and thoughtful than the 1990s monstrosity Armageddon, and features characters of greater depth than Deep Impact.  Frankly, I liked it better than the 1930s novel it was based upon.  A wonderful piece of imaginative fiction.  One of the best.",1001894400,3,550,5.066666666666666

From Wikipedia: The Academy ratio of 1.375:1 (abbreviated as 1.37:1) is an aspect ratio of a frame of 35mm film when used with 4-perf pulldown. It was standardized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as the standard film aspect ratio in 1932, although similar-sized ratios were used as early as 1928.",1524960000,,455,4.290697674418604
