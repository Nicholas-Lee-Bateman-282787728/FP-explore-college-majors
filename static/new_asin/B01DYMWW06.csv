8757305,5,B01DYMWW06,"Great little documentary.  It's not the comprehensive story of the Voyager probes but it does cover a number of things I haven't seen in other films (i.e. mathematician Michael Minovitch - whom calculated a way to visit the outer planets).  The documentary touches on all the major events in the probes' journey and features interviews from a number of people that worked on the Voyager program.

The DVD includes a bonus film on the shuttle program as well.  One hour in length, made shortly before the fleet was retired.

Well worth the price!",1488326400,,545,4.817204301075269
8757306,3,B01DYMWW06,"Just finished watching ""Voyager - To The Final Frontier"" released by BBC.
Presented by Dallas Campbell, ""Voyager - To The Final Frontier"" is an enjoyable history of how the Voyager project to explore the outer solar system came together, along with interviews of all the key players along the way, but it did leave out a great deal of the scientific discoveries the twin Voyager spacecraft made along the way.
Also included in this DVD release is ""The Space Shuttle - A Horizon Guide"" which gives a rather bland overview of the Space Shuttle's history, and it oddly doesn't mention Space Shuttle Enterprise, nor does it mention Space Shuttle Endeavour.
Recommended.
Three Stars.",1472342400,,678,5.008849557522124
