8276183,5,B0002TV2ZG,"This series of 20 hour-long episodes (in French) follows the life of Emilie Bordeleau (later Pronovost) from the time she leaves home to teach in a one room schoolhouse in turn of the century Quebec through marriage, children and beyond. The quality of the drama is amazing. Plot and character development progress artfully as the story unfolds. Great acting, beautiful production, excellent music score. Marina Orsini brilliantly plays a heroine of the highest order, portraying independence, passion and perseverance.

This DVD collection is good quality with episode and scene menus, interactive quizes and still pictures. The only disappointment is the failure to include a second audio track of the well-made English dub that was used for broadcast in English-speaking Canada.",1128384000,,781,5.508333333333334
