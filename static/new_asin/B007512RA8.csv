5055267,5,B007512RA8,"My daughter enjoys all of the Sid the Science Kid shows.  This one is perhaps one of our favorite as it includes a song about trees that we just love (being tree huggers ourselves).  My daughter has actually learned all of the words to the song and ""performs"" it at family events.",1354838400,,280,4.365384615384615
5055268,5,B007512RA8,"My niece and nephew are 4 and 6 yrs, and they love all the Sid shows.  We can see that they do learn a lesson and keep asking for more episodes.  You won't be disappointed.  This camping episode was perfect, because they went camping this summer & they applied some of Sid's suggestions.  Enjoy!",1347408000,3,295,4.407407407407407
5055269,3,B007512RA8,"this DVD only has one episode, nice one but not enough. I like the other ones that have more than one.",1338163200,2,102,3.9047619047619047
5055270,5,B007512RA8,"Ever since this series started I was impressed with the message and the content that the show provided, as it encouraged kids to be active learners and this DVD was no different. While there was only one episode on this DVD, it followed a similar format to some of the shows that are on PBS, though it was extended (being 45 minutes long). I knew this going in so I was not surprised that there was not more on the DVD (though I would have loved more). The DVD itself was filled with some great music and I loved seeing the interaction between Sid and his Dad, as a positive relationship between father and son is always a good thing to see on television. All-in-all I was impressed with the DVD and will say that anyone that loves Sid the Science Kid will enjoy this. If you have never seen this series, you should as it teaches kids so much about the world around them, but also about friendship, self-esteem and individuality.",1337817600,,929,4.406976744186046
5055271,4,B007512RA8,"I purchased this DVD as a preorder because the subject of this Sid the Science Kid DVD seemed cute, and seasonally relevant.  The DVD information said it was 45 minutes long, so I assumed (wrongly) that there would be more than one episode of Sid the Science Kid on this DVD.

There is only one episode, the backyard campout.  While this episode is very cute, calls upon familiar songs from other episodes, and got our child interested in camping in the backyard, it isn't really enough content to fill a DVD.  The other contents of this DVD are mostly previews for other shows like Chloe's Closet and Dive Olly Dive, and an additional Sid sing-along song.

This episode is adorable, and my son clearly enjoys it, as evidenced by the constant singing of the ""Beautiful Trees"" song, but I wish this DVD had more content on it for the price.",1337299200,11,839,4.566666666666666

5055275,5,B007512RA8,"My son really loves Sid The Science Kid, but this episode is the best we've seen by far! Instead of the routine up in the morning for school and home again, Sid spends a weekend at home with his dad and friend Gerald. It shows different areas of his house and backyard. I would definitely recommend this unique episode.",1452038400,,319,4.423728813559322

5055292,5,B007512RA8,"I think Gerald gets kind of a bum rap in this show. He's always the most energetic one and I feel like the other kids kind of laugh off everything he says. Most of the time his character annoys me a bit, but we see a different side of him in this episode when the poor kid is scared of the dark, he's afraid of leaving his toys behind, and we learn a lot about his parents by the fact that they let him bring multiple suite cases to an overnight camp out....

oh, and its cute and my daughter loves it so much that I've had WAY too much time to over everything about it, lol",1374192000,,574,3.905982905982906
