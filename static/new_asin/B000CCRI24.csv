My review is the only one currenbtly on Amazon for this in DVD format the reviews from the previous years have been removed so I am not expecting alot of reponses to this in the first couple of month in is on the site. This movie has some mild action cartoon violence in it but not to the extennt of that off the first film. In a super brief flashback scene we learn that Nicodemus the head rats of Nihm before his death had made a prophecy. That Nihm would one day some how threaten the survivors from the first movie and one of the sons of Jothan Frisby would be chosen. To once again save the rats from the forces of evil and darkness. I love this movie because of it's phonominally good musical number and good life lessons, about love, forgiveness, and bravery. About three year after arriving in the hidden city thorn Valley Timmy one night when on a forging mission  meets  a female mouse named Jenny. FYI if your interestested even though this  movie is very short at only 68 minute in running time with the credits included there is a ridiculous long durinration transition period from going to the past when Timmothy Brisby is about ten years old to the future when he is about 13 years old. This transitions takes up about the first 15 minutes or about 22% of the movies total running time.  Timmothy does eventual go to a tennager but not until about the last third of the way through scene 3. So if you get impataint you can fast foward through the first fifteen minutes if you don't have the patience or the time to sit that long and or you can't stand or the musical numbers or if you fine the dialogue and commedy parts to slapstic and cheese or you just don't like the acting.  After Timmoty meets Jenny it turns out Jenny was one of a group of  mice called the lost six who failed to get out of nihm after the break out before the first movie started. We also learn that Timmothy got a leather from his mother shortly before his meeting with Jenny saying that his older brother Martin who is about 16 when the movie starts had mysteriously dissapeared. He is then inform by the escape experminetal mouse Jeeny that Martin was some how captured that she had heard him tell the directions on how to reach Thorn Valley before the scientist took him away to conduct there experiments on him. Against the orders of MR. ages a friend of the family Justin the current leader of the rats and the other rats of Nihm Timmothy and Jenny escape from thorn valley set of on a quest of epic portions to reach Nihm and save Timmoty brother martin and  the lost six.  Will they get there in time to save them? What is the horrible plan that has been set into action by a mysterious sinster enty at Nihm that is planned to take place on the night of the next full moon. Find out the answers in the thrilling action pack and heartwhealing conclusion.
