The second segment on training tips was added to cover up the dull and no value added materials in the main topic. This DVD should be taken off Amazon shelf.",1383955200,,282,4.4423076923076925

The were identical outside of the people talking, the dogs in the video and the breed history of the dog.  VERY generic.  Breed history is interesting but was still not any more informative than an internet search or a short book.",1178409600,6,316,4.508771929824562
