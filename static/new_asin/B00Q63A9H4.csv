8690528,1,B00Q63A9H4,"I loved PRINCESS HOURS Korean drama but not this version. There are name changes and missing dialogue with English subtitles.  It was so bad I couldn't keep track of the people, who now have new names and what they were doing. I originally saw PALACE by YA with excellent subtitles and picture quality.  PALACE is another name for this show. YA is the brand marketed for the United States. I have replaced my copy with this version. You are able to find a good used copy by looking up YA Korean drama DVD. I watched the prices and found a really good deal for mine.",1523836800,,565,4.371428571428571
