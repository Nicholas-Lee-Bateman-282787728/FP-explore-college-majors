8220624,1,B000VZC4EY,"Actual content on this DVD is frustratingly minimal. At no fault of Hatsumi Sensei the educational content of this DVD is, IMO, useless for the beginner and arguably not more than a novelty for even intermediate level practitioners studying under a competent instructor.

Content aside, this is not a professionally produced product. My Blu-ray player ID's this disc (with its ink-jet printed label) as a DVD-R. Fortunately for the manufacturer/seller, Amazon requires a minimum 1-star rating.

I'd try to return it, however keeping the DVD should serve as a powerful reminder of the dangers of impulse shopping.",1461369600,,612,5.298969072164948
