2604033,2,B000GB5M1K,"I love Helen Hayes and I love Miss Marple Mysteries, but this set was so disappointing.  It reminds me of the typical 80s B rated movies.  Maybe it's because I'm glad the 80s are over, but this series just seemed boring to me.",1243814400,4,226,4.232558139534884
2604034,3,B000GB5M1K,This was a good attempt at an American Miss Marple but there are so many British examples that are far better. Not bad but in all things Marple I would leave it to the Brits.,1223164800,7,174,4.0
2604035,2,B000GB5M1K,"Writing, directing, acting --- all 3rd rate.  Hayes is a particularly irritating Miss Marple.  Lots of rattling on and on about nothing, playing coy, smiling sweetly way too much, and not much native intelligence, except when she steps in with completely off-the-wall total explanations of highly complex crimes without the least prelude to her insights.  In this set, Helen Hayes comes off as a 3rd rate actress. Some of the interior locations are very beautiful but merely show, in their elegance, how they can never be incorporated with the lack of sophistication of these tele-plays.  This set is a mediocre American television mess.  Of true fascination is the appearance by Bette Davis in ""Murder with Mirrors"" filmed in 1985 -- 4 years before her death.  She is magical, though emaciated, sometimes appearing hardly conscious of her role, and seeming a kind of charity case in this production (which I'm sure she was).  Nevertheless, she is mesmerizing, in appearance and in her dotty recitation of her lines.  Her presence is both sad and amazing.  Anyway, the great standard of Miss Marple is Joan Hickson; the productions in which she appears are written and directed and acted with consummate skill, full of subtlety and magnificent mood.  She was the choice of Agatha Christie, herself.  All other interpreters of Miss Marple, and all other productions, pale when held against the Hickson standard. Those with Helen Hayes are at the bottom of the pile.",1216944000,8,1464,5.058333333333334
2604036,5,B000GB5M1K,"""Like to see a picture of a murderer?"" There's never a vacation from crime for Miss Marple who is on a doctor-prescribed stay in the West Indies.

I love this version with Helen Hayes. Helen Hayes seems to bring the Miss Marple character to life - You can be old without acting old. I have seen Joan Hickson in this role and she acts as old as the character she is portraying, which is why this version is my favorite.",1215648000,3,418,4.225
2604037,3,B000GB5M1K,"Of the three television movies featured in this set, I've only seen ""Murder With Mirrors"" (via a DVD rental service), and I felt it was pleasantly watchable.  Positives are a genuinely clever mystery and lots of notable actors, including Helen Hayes and Bette Davis.  Not-so-positive aspects include generally bland photography and direction and a too-cute musical score that regularly seeks to remind us that- fiery deaths and other unpleasant ends notwithstanding- we shouldn't take the murders all that seriously and should just enjoy the puzzle at hand.  I'm guessing that the other two movies in this set don't deviate too far from my description of this one.

Of the two acting greats mentioned above, Helen Hayes does most of the heavy lifting and carries ""Murder With Mirrors"" almost single-handedly (though I also enjoyed the feisty redhead who chased men and drove too fast).  Ms. Davis, alas, is trotted out every fifteen minutes or so and capably delivers a few lines, though one gets the feeling that she was there for little else than to up the pedigree of the production.  Thankfully, Ms. Davis' later performance in the theatrical film ""The Whales of August"" demonstrated that she still had the acting chops to handle long sequences and complicated characterization.

""Murder With Mirrors"" features a clean, full-screen TV image and there are no extras.  I suspect similar is the case regarding the other two movies in this set.",1199318400,2,1444,5.088983050847458
2604038,5,B000GB5M1K,"All of these mysteries are fun. The only negative is that ""Murder is Easy"" is not a Miss Marple mystery and doesn't really star Helen Hayes--her role is only a cameo. The real stars of that one are Olivia de Havilland and Bill Bixby. The other two are Miss Marple mysteries and do star Helen Hayes as Miss Marple. I just think that this fact should have been noted in the advertising.",1184976000,22,384,4.347222222222222
2604039,4,B000GB5M1K,"Helen Hayes was wonderful as Miss Marple, but I was dissappointed in the episode where she only appeared in the beginning!  This was the way mystery stories used to be told.  No blood, no gore, just ""mystery"" to try to match wits with the characters in the story.  Helen Hayes was perfectly cast!",1173484800,6,296,4.547169811320755

2604041,2,B000GB5M1K,"This box is a bit of a trick. I really loved two of the movies on this 3 dvd box set. Helen Hayes is great as Miss Marple.

Caribbean Mystery was my Fav. The third movie Murder is easy has Helen Hayes in the first five minutes of the movie and NOT AS MISS MARPLE! Unless you are big Bil Bixby fans this movie is not for you, THE STORY DRAGS ON AND ON. BY THE TIME THE MYSTERY IS SOLVED YOU COULD CARE LESS.

2604044,4,B000GB5M1K,"I give this a 4 star for Helen Hays' overall good acting although I was disappointed and surprised to find that in these TV series her character of Miss Marple is presented somewhat weakly, although she might have thought portraying this temperament for this character, fitting or appropriate. I seem to remember some of her older movie characters played stronger. Nevertheless, she still comes forth with that certain gift of
acting, a sense of quite command of who she was as an actress. However, having said that, I was not disappointed with these 3 dvd's, as her talent, still not easily found today, presented good acting.",1437782400,,627,4.9245283018867925
2604045,5,B000GB5M1K,This collection of movies have an air of whimsical mystery. They couldn't have found a better actress to fit Agatha Christie's character of Miss Marple than Helen Hayes.

2604074,3,B000GB5M1K,But she is certainly no Joan Hickson.  The American versions of Agatha Christie just do not seem to catch the depth in the stories.

8130168,1,B000GB5M1K,"With the greatest respect to the wonderful American actress Helen Hayes these three ""Agatha Christie interpretations"" were APPALLING.

I'm not sure if the people who rated them with 4 or 5 stars have either ever read an actual Agatha Christie story or seen any of the four superb British actresses (Joan Hickson, Geraldine McEwan, Julia McKenzie and even the campy Margaret Rutherford) in their dozens and dozens of films but evidently these three Americanized ""versions"" of Christie stories seem to appeal to some audiences.

In not trying to be cruel I viewed each of these three ""adaptations"" more akin to a cross between episodes of Barnaby Jones and The Love Boat.

Essentially any semblance of the original Christie plots has been so watered down they are unrecognizable to a true fan. Over and above that I actually found them painful to watch.

And again, with the utmost respect for Helen Hayes, the way she plays Miss Marple (in two of the 3 films in the box set - she is only in the 3rd film for 5 minutes) is nothing like they were originally written.

Yes; the producers brought in the big guns (actor wise) with the iconic Bette Davis, Olivia de Haviland  and John Mills... but even they could not save that particular film.

So a warning to all of those who are trying to ""tick the boxes"" in seeing all the Agatha Christie Miss Marple versions out there PLEASE stick with the British actors: they obviously know what they are doing.",1493078400,5,1447,4.695652173913044
