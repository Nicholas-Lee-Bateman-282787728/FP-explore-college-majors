1198146,4,B000009RMV,"I liked this film.  It's a slow moving piece that grows on you. I agree that the dialogue could have been better (or maybe it's just the translation), but I thought it was a good cross between the hypnotic style of Kurosawa and an old-fashioned gangster flick.  One of the reviewers said that it was just a bunch of guys waiting around.  Well... that's partly true, but I found there to be poetry in the silence - much like in ""The Scent of Green Papaya"".  We've been so brainwashed by Hollywood films that we get ""bored"" when nothing is said or done.  This is not an action movie.  It's a meditation on time.
I see it this way...  You may walk out of a bloodfest happy to have seen so many die, but... is the movie going to stay with you?  It's the quiet ones that haunt you.  It's the ... moments that flash in your memory - watching the waves crash against the shore as the men play russian roulette... the full moon that hangs in the sky, waiting along with them. It's in the bonding that takes place.  The last few minutes of the film will stay with me.

1198147,2,B000009RMV,"Easily one of the most vaccuous movies in recent memory.  Only for those fans who misjudge the empty silences between explicable action or dialogue as fraught with profound implications.  This movie is nothing but a pretentious yakuza flick.  The gunfights are cheesy (they go off like cap-guns), the acting is wooden (Kitano especially, who possibly has two expressions to choose from), and the characterization is completely arbitrary.  And if I see one more movie glorifying another gangster, whether or not he has the heart of a poet, I'm doing something rash like joining the NRA.",970012800,3,585,5.126315789473685

1198149,4,B000009RMV,"There's hardly any story in Sonatine.  While that's no rarity in a Kitano film, Sonatine (a musical term) seems to follow the sense evoked by the title by abandoning all attempts at progressive story, concentrating  instead on images of almost surreal aesthetic power, deadpan humour, and a  bare script that makes the movie taciturn, neutral, and ultimately somber,  counteracting the humour with loaded themes of damnation and  revenge.
Watch Sonatine for the visuals -- it's a visual poem that at  times, based on composition, colour and angling, can challenge even a  visual masterpiece like Kurosawa's Kagemusha:  The Shadow Warrior.",949104000,3,638,5.373737373737374
7905720,5,B000009RMV,"I watched this film years ago, and remember with amusement the firework fight on the beach. It is a brilliant film and I suppose very typically kitanoesque, if that's a word!? The film centres around a gang war, where one Yakuza clan needs to sort out another. A number of them head to the island of Okinawa to sort things out. Nothing really goes to plan though, and while the gang, lead by Murukawa wait for the war to erupt, they play practical jokes on each other and indulge in silliness such as digging holes to fall into and a fight with fireworks on the beach at night. Yes, even murderous gangsters can have their fun after all!

Eventually things start to get serious and Murukawa's gang start getting bumped off one by one in various ways even though they do fight back. There's lots of violence and bloodletting but the film isn't without charm and a very good sense of humour. There are also twists within the plot which I won't tell you about; you should buy the film!

What I love about this film is especially the music score; it makes me weep it is so profound. And, I can say this too: there are some films, some pieces of music, some poetry etc that can get into the very core of you; you don't know why they make an impact but they do. This film has this in aces. It really is a great film and makes me think of things that I can't really put into words, even though I am writing a review about it! I expect there are numerous pieces of wonderful art and movies and writing and music that move people in similar ways; this is one of those things.

This is a great movie, and Kitano is a genius.",1370563200,,1614,4.250814332247557
7905721,4,B000009RMV,"Sonatine (Takeshi Kitano, 1993)

While Takeshi Kitano has worked in any number of genres over the years, when it came to directing, he started with the yakuza film. Many great Japanese directors do (Takashi Miike was getting his start directing V-cinema yakuza flicks around the same time Kitano started, for example). But in front of the camera, Kitano had already spent years as a sketch comedian. It was inevitable that eventually these two disciplines would cross in his work. It ended up not taking long at all; Sonatine, Kitano's fourth picture, blends action and absurd in such a way as to have become a favorite of many of Kitano's fans.

Aniki Murakawa (Kitano) is a Tokyo-based yakuza who runs an inept, but lucrative, gang. Their boss sends the whole crew to Okinawa on what seems to be a routine mission--but when they get there, they find out it's anything but routine and suspect they've been set up. Wounded, the gang retire to a local deserted beach to lay low, heal, and plot their revenge. On their first night there, Aniki rescues beautiful, nave Miyuki (Aya Kokumai in her screen debut) from an assailant, and for a time, the cares of the world slip away, and the beach hideaway becomes a world apart...but revenge is always knocking on the door.

This should be obvious, but it seems to have not been for some people: this is not a typical gangster movie, any more than the gangster movies of Kitano's idol Jean-Luc Godard were actually gangster movies. If you go into this expecting endless gunplay, you're going to hate it. The core of the film is the time the characters spend at the beach; the yakuza stuff surrounding it is a frame. (Compare and contrast to Godard's Pierrot le Fou, to which this film is an homage, or one of Miike's best efforts, The Bird People in China, which cleaves to the same theme.) It's not about action, it's about soul-searching and redemption and all that stuff that features so prominently in Kitano's comedic films (Kikujiro is an obvious choice here, and Achilles and the Tortoise is another qualifier). And if you go into it looking for THAT, you're going to get much more out of it. Personally, I think it's a wonderful thing indeed, and recommend it without hesitation, though it's not as good as Kikujiro. *** ",1366761600,,2272,4.72979797979798

7905723,1,B000009RMV,"I got almost nothing out of this movie.  I'd like to believe the guy who suggests that it's because I don't speak Japanese, but I don't think that's the problem.  I've enjoyed lots of foreign films, including Zatoichi by the same director.  This movie, however, I did not enjoy.  All of the comparisons to The Godfather and Goodfellas are totally unwarranted, and I must say I wonder if the people making them are truly genuine, or just plants of some kind.  There are parts of Sonatine that I enjoyed, but on the whole I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  I will say that some of the acting is good, but as a whole the movie does not succeed.",1145664000,,650,4.420168067226891
7905724,5,B000009RMV,"Sonatine can get quite a few prizes just for the music. Even the silence matches the music. The photography is classical and the canvases are poetic. Sometimes you forget that you are watching a gang war movie rather you will feel that you are watching an extremely romantic movie. Takeshi Kitano is just an amazing actor. Cinematography and frame design is comparable Kurosawa.

Takeshi Kitano is a renegade gang leader who is trying to save his own life from his mob boss. Most of the movie is in a location where he is hiding along with 4 of his cohorts.

If you do not understand Japanese then you will miss out since it is very difficult to do correct translation of Japanese words. You get a translation but you do not get the connotations.

As a whole this is a highly exciting movie. I will not recommend

it for kids since it has too much blood and violence.",1100304000,3,867,4.468354430379747
7905725,4,B000009RMV,"First I want to point out , to the negative reviewers , .. that foreign film is not a genre...

 I don;t understand when people say , ""I rent foreign films 4 days a week , and this one's the worst""

 This is a crime film , and kitano's one of the best at the yakuza genre...

 First , you have to be familiar with the yakuza culture to understand the characters , ....

 Yes , they don;t care if they live or die , I think the whole freaking point of the movie was that...

 So , if you like crime , and yakuza films , this one's a great one , ... not kitano's best , but , it's still great...

 If you just like to watch foreign films because you think they have something that hollywood films don;t , or just because you want to look cool , I do not recomend this...

 you will not get this film , ...",1091232000,4,803,3.817073170731707
7905726,4,B000009RMV,"Sonatine is a great film on all fronts. Quite different from many other Yakuza-genre films, Sonatine tends to take more of subtle and effecting itinerary than the more common violence blazing, action-oriented routes. This film is far from voided of any violence, but it uses it affectingly: in droves or dispersed, that's all the really matters. Takeshi Kitano is always excellent (from Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence to MXC :); he alone can make a film worth watching. He doesn't need to in this one though; an all a round outstanding film :).",1089417600,,543,4.913043478260869
7905727,5,B000009RMV,"I've seen many, perhaps most, of Kitano's films and enjoyed this one the most.  The film works rhythmically and musically better than Firworks (hanabi) and Boiling Point (3-4 x 10gatsu), and addresses the same themes (the isolation, futility and entrapments of yakuza life and violence, the beauty of the ocean, loyalty, revenge, desperation, etc.)  much more succinctly and poignantly.  Particularly the second half of the film, that takes place by the ocean, is full of bittersweet humor and a beautiful simplicity, which are a nice contrast to the violence of the yakuza underworld.  This film also manages to escape the nauseating sentimentality of Kikujiro, yet remain true to its poetic heart.",1068940800,,699,5.27027027027027
7905728,5,B000009RMV,"I was surprised to read the negative reviews but in a way I understand.  The movie is not for everyone.  In my younger days, I would have felt that the movie was too slow.  But now I think this is one of the greatest movies.  The movie moves at a slow pace but that is the point.  You get to know the people ""as they are"", not in an action packed or glamorous way.
I especially liked the end ""fight scene"" where he takes out the bosses, note how he ""says it all without saying anything"". This is a ""must see"" movie...
