Huge bummer that there aren't more seasons of this show!!",1380585600,,262,5.190476190476191
8392591,5,B0039ZF8IM,"Nine overweight Britons are divided into 3 period teams: Victorian, Edwardian, and 1920s, and put on various historical diets. It's presumably competitive to see which of the diets is most effective, but after one of them leaves in a snit, and it also becomes clear of the cast are more motivated than others, it's hard to gauge which is more effective than others, but the final conclusion made is that they all work, and health and fitness are more a factor of self-discipline than anything else.

The casting is a huge part of the appeal of this show, and makes it fun to watch. The eight overweight Britons who are left are charming and good-natured, and open about their own experiences with their body images, fat discrimination, and health concerns. The staff that monitors them is strict, scolding, and yet charming, too. The historian who runs the experiment is such a fat Nazi, calling them blobs of fat buried under lumpy clothes. He often chides the contestants about their comportment, manners, and lack of willpower. ""Matron,"" the nurse, weights them and watches their health, but once she just lays into one guy after he grabs someone else's leftover desert, and tells him he can just enjoy that cheese when he's got his legs cut off when he gets diabetes, which he ""surely will 5-6 years from now."" There's the old school New-Age spirit, who teaches the cast (well, mostly the 1920s crew) about interpretive dance and naturism. And there's the grumpy butler, who openly thinks the contestants are bunch of misbehaved children.

One thing you learn is that there is practically nothing new when it comes to what we think of to do in weight-loss and health. The Victorians follow a low-carb diet; the Edwardians chew each bite 32 times; and the 1920s bunch follow a 1200-calorie diet with a lot of fruit and vegetables. The Victorians get ice baths (think of our modern-day ice swimmers); the Edwardians work out with weights; the 1920s crew get colonics (which some celebrities swear by today.) You see these things in their historical context, as well as some sporting activities which have been forgotten, like a ""paper chase."" Oh, and the contestants are often tested on their willpower, and some of them put on a performance with historical-era entertainment for the others, like an Edwardian strongman show. Anything that is dodgy may be presented (like eating a tapeworm to lose weight), but isn't done.

Oh, and everyone is in historical costume, and yes, as a result, 4 of the ladies have to wear corsets, even when working out. They rarely complain about it, although one says how exhausted she is after running around outside is her heavy crinolines and hoop skirt. You get so used to it that you're as pleased and amused as they are when they're back in modern clothes at the end, and the strict historian who's been in starched collar for weeks is just a nice-looking guy in a leather jacket. They all look great and happier in the end.

As a spoiler, I was really disappointed with the guy who left. Supposedly, he was a frontman for a band, but he leaves because he feels _so_ humiliated for having to wear a costume and put on the strongman show. The frontmen I've enjoyed are terribly shameless, no matter what they look like (think Jack Black), so his weight was just an excuse for his other failures. The rest of the cast open up despite their reservations about themselves and their abilities, and that makes you cheer and root for all of them. It was more fun and inspiring that I thought it would be.",1347321600,2,3536,4.7353896103896105
8392592,5,B0039ZF8IM,"I really enjoyed Diets That Time Forgot. They took 9 people and sent them to an old mansion in the U.K. They were sorted into groups of Edwardian, Victorian, and 20s-Style exercise and diet. Staff and participants are dressed according to their group. They don't always like the clothes, the food, or the exercise. In fact, most of the time they don't. However, they are losing weight and having fun with it. Watching it makes my own workout go by faster. Laughing is also healthy.",1327708800,8,481,4.670588235294118
8392593,5,B0039ZF8IM,"9 modern obese Brits agree to a Diet Reality show which includes an experiment of weight loss through the use of 3 old British diets. There is also a competition between 3 teams of 3. Diets vary for each team: Edwardian diet team; Victorian diet team; and Roaring 20s calorie-controlled diet team. Who will win? Which diet is best? If any. The show covers 6 episodes, a total of 24 days at the beautiful Victorian country house turned into diet center. I'd love to visit the estate, but not for the diet plan.

The show was obviously created for entertainment, but it also provides a documentary of 3 old diets that many or may not work for today's lifestyles. It is an experiment in the validity of the diets as well as the tenacity & willpower of the diet needy participants. It's fun getting to know the over-eaters.

The diets are: Victorian-meat, no carbs; Edwardian-chew, chew, 32 times, but anything; and 1920s-celery, veggies, celery, fruit, 1200 cal. a day.

Even costumes are provided, period perfect, as well as exercise in historic methods. Many other weird historic diet measures are introduced: ice-water bath, nude exercise, paper chase, erotic dance, sand bath, sun bath, steam, colonic irrigation, army drills, etc. Not all you witness would likely be recommended by your family physician. Education provided for the 9 participants vary from a fat pig dissection, weight loss comparisons to hampers of potatoes and lard bricks, farm market, clothing, child-birthing by the obese, etc.

It is sometimes alarming, sometimes funny, sometimes educational. Through it all, it is entertaining. Who will survive? Who will loose? Who will change forever? Who will cheat? Who needs psychological help? I'll not spoil your fun by divulging the diet results.

Episodes are: 1 Measuring Up, 2Burning It Off, 3 The Great Outdoors, 4 The Great Insides, 5 The Slimming Drill, 6 Extreme Measures.

A warning on the box says ""Contains nudity, coarse language, and medical scenes"". This DVD is not kid or family friendly as it contains full nudity, men and women, and some very crude-obscene vulgarity. No subtitles. It also has a very good, basic, diet perspective.

Might be good entertainment and motivation for the frequent dieter.",1277251200,20,2234,5.0379403794037945
