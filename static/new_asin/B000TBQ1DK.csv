2896247,5,B000TBQ1DK,"This DVD is a mix of yoga/pilates and dance! They have easy-to-learn routines, and a fun yoga class! This DVD has tons of options, and I really recommend it for someone maybe 13 and up.  The instructors are teens, so you really get the feel like you're in a dance/yoga class!",1231632000,6,275,4.392156862745098
2896248,5,B000TBQ1DK,"This is really good for kids that want to learn some dance moves and be active.  I really like the hiphop stuff.  If you want your teen to workout some, this is pretty simple and fun.",1193270400,5,183,4.055555555555555

8208532,1,B000TBQ1DK,worst video ever. they shoot from 50-60 feet away don't see moves very well,1474243200,,75,4.428571428571429
8208533,1,B000TBQ1DK,"Ridiculous!!  I have used countless workout  DVDs over the years and the good ones and bad ones (with the exception of this one) all have had one thing in common: THEY TEACH YOU WHAT/HOW TO DO BEFORE THEY ""DO.""  I got this for my daughter believing this to be a universal recipe for a workout DVD but was sadly disappointed.  They launch right into some routine with zero instruction, they photo shopped it obnoxiously (what the hell is a floating star frame? who could have possibly thought that was a good idea?) and they angled the camera on the dancers in such a way that at times you couldn't even tell what exactly they were doing on the other side WHICH was the area specific to the exercise.  Be wary, do not waste you money on this one.",1440460800,,745,4.369565217391305

8208535,3,B000TBQ1DK,"I should have paid attention to the word ""extreme"" work out. I bought it for my granddaughter who loves to dance with me when she comes to visit. It was way to fast and difficult to follow. But I am 63 and she is only 11. Maybe someone in the middle would like it.",1418774400,,264,3.9074074074074074
8208536,2,B000TBQ1DK,The moves on this video are really cute however there is no instruction. It's only pure dancing so your child will have to watch it over and over and memorize by sight only.,1327795200,,173,4.2727272727272725
8208537,2,B000TBQ1DK,"The graphics they put on this to make it look ""cool"" are distracting and annoying. The dances are all too fast for kids to keep up and the stretching part is only 5 minutes long. Not worth the money!",1320019200,3,199,4.128205128205129
8208538,1,B000TBQ1DK,"I disagree with other reviews.  This video is for advanced users only.  I have a 14 year old daughter who desired to lose some weight and become more active this summer by using this workout video.  During the first segment, ""WARM-UP""  (lol), the actors/dancers jump right into a very fast paced and choreographed dance routine, with no instruction or time given whatsoever to learn any of the moves.  My daughter & I just looked at each other with a classic 'W..T..F....' look on our faces.  Then, several minutes later, they are doing full-blown spinning & hand/head stand moves..  One girl actually performed a break-dance style head-stand using her neck & shoulder as support,  which if not done properly would certainly lead to severe neck and back trauma.  These moves are not something any beginner could even attempt.  And remember, this is just during ""WARM-UP""s..  If my daughter was as athletic and fit as the dancers on the video then maybe she could try some of the routine after replaying it several dozen times, but then again we wouldnt be buying the video if she was already in perfect physical shape and had taken dance classes before.  To quote the packaging:  ""Created by pro sports dancers just for teens.."",  Sure...  ""Get fit, have fun, and learn cool new dance moves.."",  Nope.

We wound up getting High School Musical 3 for a bargain price (its a PS2 game that plays on PS3), and she now has fun with dance moves that are presented in incremental difficulties.  Keeping it fun & keeping her interested is obviously the big challenge, and its been working great so far.  Just fyi, we needed PS2-> PS3 controller converters (2) in order to plug the floor dance pads into our PS3.  Hope the suggestion helps.",1308787200,16,1730,4.760942760942761
8208539,5,B000TBQ1DK,I have given Teen Tone to several friends daughters for birthdays and holidays. They use it for fun dance parties at sleepovers and to learn some new dances. The Learn the Moves section slows the dances down so the kids can follow along or practice with the pro dancers. The cool thing is that its real teens in the video. All the girls I've given it to have had a lot of fun with it and I feel good because it gets them moving!,1286150400,3,428,4.107142857142857
8208540,5,B000TBQ1DK,This dance/workout video is a blast. My daughter (age 12) and her friends love it. Great for sleepover entertainment!!!,1235692800,,119,5.315789473684211
