1866750,5,B00008YGOH,"I thought this documentary was riveting from the first moment it started to the last shot. Fantastic story about these kids from Russia and their struggles and hopes. They are so incredibly talented and charming that you just can't help but care for them - this is also a compliment to the filmmakers who crafted this story with care and great talent. The band members all give such insight into their lives and their dreams, especially Lydia Salnikova (pianist and vocals). A scene where she has dinner with her family in Russia is so poignant - I felt it was the center of this story. Natasha (guitar and vocals) and Ilya (guitar virtuoso and vocals) also provide amazing stories, but as the problems get bigger and bigger Lydia talks about the fear of the struggle so eloquently I felt like it was happening to me. These kids are beautiful and intelligent and incredibly talented - I know there's great things to come from them and I suspect their individual talents will break through too - Ilya's guitar, Lydia's piano and vocals, Sasha's dobro (yes dobro!), Natasha's vocals... you will love this movie and their music!",1073260800,12,1125,4.774358974358974
1866751,5,B00008YGOH,"THE BALLAD OF BERING STRAIT documents the struggles of an enterprising group of young country musicians from Russia to break through with American audiences, leading up to the release of their self-titled debut album.  Director Nina Gilden Seavey gives us a solid look at the rise of this hard-working band and gives a particular emphasis on the abilities of lead vocalist/guitarist Natasha Borzilova and instrumental virtuoso Ilya Toshinsky.  The band's self-titled debut album was one of the best albums to be released in 2003, with ""Bearing Straight"", a track from that album, coming very close to winning a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental Performance.  And after you see THE BALLAD OF BERING STRAIT, you too will see the reason why these young musicians are worth rooting for.",1072828800,8,785,5.165354330708661
1866752,5,B00008YGOH,"I love this new DVD documentary about Bering Strait. You guys are such an inspiration too us all! All though im a (Metal & Progressive Rock Music Student) I still love your music. Keep the music flowing. Its nice for a change that good music can come from other countries and not only USA.

1866753,5,B00008YGOH,"Bering Strait is the freshest thing to come down the ""music road"" in a long time. The music business can't understand why there is such a slump in the record sales. If they would concentrate on more groups like this one they might find that record sales would rise! This group has more talent than all those Nashville ""cookie cutter"" entertainers that are currently on the market. This group has more chemistry together than I ever saw in even the Beatles...These kids are a real breath of fresh air....",1054771200,20,503,4.662921348314606
7987893,5,B00008YGOH,"I ordered the dvd from GENES FRANKLIN LIBRARY BOOKS , I received it pretty fast. Also the seller wrote me a hand written card thanking me for the purchase unheard of . Like many reviewers I also saw them on 60 Minutes never knew what happened to Bering Strait well this video answered it for me. From childhood to Wolf Trap it is in here. Each member talks about his or her experience in music and life. Great documentary ,enjoyed the extras ,especially the concert at Wolf Trap only way to end The Ballad of Bering Strait. A great buy for those who enjoy real music and not todays garbage.",1473638400,,590,4.372727272727273
7987894,5,B00008YGOH,Really fun film.  The band is awesome and their story is so unexpected.  Very much enjoyed it.,1468627200,,94,4.470588235294118
7987895,5,B00008YGOH,What an uplifting story.  And to come out of Russia is amazing.  The music is incredible!  I particularly loved the concert.,1438560000,,124,4.809523809523809

7987898,5,B00008YGOH,"This documentary gives great insight to the talent and struggles of the first Russian band to ever be nominated for a Grammy. The group came to America as a group of child prodigies and realized what a slow moving machine the music industry is. I have watched it a few times and each time I am reminded that talent does not always win in the music industry but after following the band, it is nice to realize they are all still making music in some form or fashion even though they are no longer together. Natasha Borzilova, the lead singer has three solo albums out and perhaps if they had been able to do more of her original material, they would have had more success. Lydia Salnikova, the pianist is also pursuing a solo career with her first solo album out. Every aspiring musician should see this film to remind themselves of what they will be up against.",1356566400,,861,4.455696202531645
7987899,5,B00008YGOH,"Thank you so much for taking an interest in this film!

To answer those of you who have wondered where the band members are now and what they are doing... Bering Strait is no longer together, but you'll be pleased to know that everyone is still in the United States and still pursuing music, to varying degrees - as solo artists, studio musicians and/or road musicians. So the journey continues.

7987900,4,B00008YGOH,"This is an enjoyable documentary about a group of young musicians who first learned how to play on Bluegrass instruments as children in Russia, and then as young adults were brought to Nashville in hopes of making it big.

While I thoroughly enjoyed this film, I personally think it would've benefitted from more footage of these outstanding musicians playing music, and less footage of the inner workings of the music industry and all the waiting for something to happen.

While I was engrossed in the lives of these young people and the American music they played, I waited until near the end to hear one song which blended their love for Bluegrass with their native Russian music. To me the highlight of the film was when these folks energetically played a Russian song on Bluegrass instruments live at Wolf Trap.

It's indeed unfortunate that Bering Strait didn't experience a longer life on the charts here, but it appears some of them are still at it in other configurations.",1229990400,,981,4.8273809523809526
7987901,5,B00008YGOH,"The documentary shows that there is no such thing as an overnight success. There are years of dreams, heartache and confusion before the fans hears the first song on the radio.
