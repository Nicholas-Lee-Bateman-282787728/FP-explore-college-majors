6482153,5,B00LG7VWIA,I thoroughly enjoyed America: Imagine a World without Her.  It was very well done.  It points out the groups in America that would like to see her fail and examines each complaint to show the negative belief is not valid.  He showed the war and what if Washington did not survive.  He talked about the slaves - both white and black.  How they got here and how some rose above their situation and became successful.  D'Souza showed how beautiful America is and how we got to where we are and those that are currently playing a significant part in trying to tear her down.  We must be forever diligent and stand up for what we believe.  There is still hope.,1404259200,245,655,4.4
6482154,5,B00LG7VWIA,"My 12 year old son and I just returned from watching the movie, and it was well done.  The movie can be a great educational tool by having students research the issues from both sides and present them in to classroom debate.",1404259200,28,224,4.333333333333333
6482155,5,B00LG7VWIA,"My family just saw this movie for the second time.  It is so packed with emotion and information it really should be seen more than once. This movie is perfect for ALL Americans to see.  Those who disagree with the filmmaker, Dinesh D'Souza, will appreciate the voices of criticism included, even highlighted, in the film.  Those more friendly to his message, will be very emotionally moved, and intellectually inspired.

Dinesh DSouza has created a tribute and defense of our nation unique to his perspective as an immigrant, an intellectual, and a sincerely spiritual man.  It is common knowledge that our citizens are sharply divided along political and cultural lines.  Have you ever wondered why?  Is there a group of people who benefit from this polarization and division?  Do we have influential people in America who want to tear down America?  Who embrace national suicide?  Mr. DSouza interviews many of these people, and you will be shocked by what they say!  This movie is scary, funny, inspiring, and thought-provoking.

Like the picturesque aerial footage shown in a memorable section of the film (as Dinesh flies over parts of our county), the mental tour he takes of Americas worldview landscape is a wild ride.  Only we can write the rest of the story.  Where are we going next?  Definitively worth seeing with the whole family!",1404259200,341,1345,4.968609865470852
6482156,4,B00LG7VWIA,"This was a solid  but not perfect  effort by DSouza to dispel many of the false or exaggerated indictments against America made regularly by the political left. Re-enactments of historic events and battles scenes added nice flavor but were overused, especially toward the end of the film. (I did, however, very much appreciate the dramatic portrayal of Madam C. J. Walker [Sarah Breedlove], the first black, female, self-made millionaire in America.) There were a few, annoying technical glitches, too, like the out-of-focus interview with Rand Paul.

DSouza addressed some indictments better than others. He did a good job explaining that slavery during the countrys founding was the norm at the time. The historical aberration was the fact that the US fought a civil war and almost destroyed itself in order to abolish slavery  that was a first in history. DSouza likewise did an adequate job analyzing the how America acquired California and Texas from Mexico. On the other hand, I felt he should have placed more emphasis on explaining the benefits of capitalism and the free market.

It was nice to see Saul Alinsky called out and his tactics exposed. Its eerie to see Alinskys ideas being expressed and executed today by Barak Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Especially touching was U2 front man Bonos remarks about America at Georgetown University. Sometimes it takes a foreign-born person to remind us to never take for granted the revolutionary ideas gifted to the world by our Founders.

I felt DSouza did a fair job making his points, but I never got to that emotional high-point, that moment when everything falls into place and you want to shout, yes! I really hoped the film would provide a constant stream of slam-dunk arguments, that it would be the perfect documentary to change the minds of my progressive friends. While it didn't deliver on that level, I would say its still an important and worthwhile film to see.",1404172800,67,1930,4.975155279503106

6482168,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Lots of good information. America has made many mistakes along the way, but Im very, very proud to be an American. Just visit any other country (not the tourist areas), and youll appreciate the freedoms we have. Were this great nation because of our history not in spite of it. Obama wanted to change history. No one can undue or change the past. We LEARN from it and make improvements. Many generations of Americans did not take part in the many injustices we suffered. Yes, there are still injustices. However, we don't need another civil war to solve our problems. Many people don't realize how this great nation came about because history isn't taught or poorly taught in our schools today. Common Corp needs to go. The word common tells you how unAmericsn this is. Common means we all think alike. No individuality. Only the liberal government is allowed to think. The populace become sheep. We are stripped of our freedoms. Im sure any lazy person wants the government to take care of them. The vast majority of us want the government to work FOR WE THE PEOPLE. Common Corp indoctrinates the people to work for the government. This documentary points out the disastrous results of the government having too much power. If Hillary had become President, we could have easily repeated the mistakes of our past. President Trump might be rough around the edges, but hes definitely, most assuredly for the betterment of WE THE PEOPLE.",1522454400,2,1434,4.809716599190283

He is more patriotic than most of the born and bread in America progressive lefties that walk around pretending to observe the constitution. It is a must see.

Since 2012 was also the year of the death of Andrew Breitbart, the abandonment of Americans by the President at Benghazi, and the re-election of Obama, this video kept me going while many patriots around me were filled with despair.

6482324,5,B00LG7VWIA,"I Purchased a copy for each of my 2 kids. Both are college educated, oldest has graduated, and youngest is attending. The following is basically what I wrote them.

I can think of only a few teachers that you've had that love America. Maybe you've had a few in college.

Why is loving America and the principles she was founded on something usually only conservatives do?

The Frankfort School was founded to study how to bring about world Communism. War was supposed to bring the revolution, but WWI came and went, so they moved to Cultural Marxism. They have been very influential in society.

""Critical Theory,"" or to criticize only the west w/o solutions, has been divisive to society and led to: Black Studies, Women Studies, and etc. Also, has led to the general belief of America's evilness.

Theodor Adorno stated anything to the right was Fascist and believers needed therapy. Fascism was Socialism: NAZI, short for National Socialist German Worker's Party; and Mussolini's Italian Fascist Party was originally called Italian Socialist Party. Fascism is collectivist, from the Latin for bundle, or the synergy of we're Stronger Together. Fascism is intolerant of any views not their own, using intimidation and violence to suppress them. For Adorno Fascism / Socialism WAS to the right of HIS Communism. It also took the baggage and evil from WW2 associated with the left and put it on the center and right.

Herbert Marcusa's ""Liberating Tolerance,"" or to be intolerant of any views to the right of the left, has led to the decline of Freedom of Speech in society, especially on University Campuses.

These explain Political Correctness. These explain why Trump supporters are labeled Fascist while mobs assault and beat them. When they are not the ones being Fascist.

Communism and Socialism killed around 120 million people by their own governments during the 20th century in places such as Germany, USSR, China, and others. They don't work.

This entertaining movie answers the left's criticisms of America. Staring some of the left's most vocal critics such as Noam Chomsky the MIT linguist, author of ""Manufacturing Consent.""

There is an old American Indian saying, ""A friend is someone who sings your song to you when you have forgotten it.""

Immigrant Dinesh D'Souza is such a friend with this movie, ""America: Imagine a World w/o Her.""

As he says, it's left to us to restore her. I would add, protect. Enjoy.",1478390400,,2429,4.985148514851486

In America, your rights come from God-  though this is quickly being forgotten. The more idiots there are, the more we give up our rights to other idiots.  Even the victors cannot rewrite enough history to hide their descent into imbecility.

 It really gets down to the nuts and bolts of what is ""really"" happening in our country.  I just hope that the majority of the American people don't take too long to wake up to the true reality in which they are currently living.  I hope one day they realize how much they have been lead on by the Democrats and left leaning Republicans and decide to stop being such pauns in their grand scemes to demorilize the public and trick them into believing that America has been the cause of so many of the worlds problems.  While there have been some dark notes in our history; we as a people and nation have always strived to do better and the founders new this was one of our best traits.  When they worked to found this nation there were some unsavory compromises made to ensure the creation of the nation.  Yet many of the founders also believed that over time these compromises would be and should be resolved differnetly that slavery should be abolished and many even agreed that the Indians (native amricans) should never have been treated as they were.  It is just extremely sad and disappointing how the left has been able to deceive so many in our nation into believing that they are the ones who really care about minorities and the common citizen.  Yet in reality the left is really just using these people to maintain their power as they slowly and secretly work to erode our freedoms in favor of an omnipotent State controlling every aspect of our lives. For example in adds put out by the Obama administration depicting a fictitious ""Julia"" throught her life having her every decisioin either planed or strong influence by the omnipresent Obama State.  It reminds me of things from Geoge Orwells 1984 and things I have read from Hitlers Mencoff and some of the ramblings of Carl Marx and Joseph Stalin; which are all very frightening.

We don't live in a perfect society and this country's history isn't clean either, but when taken on a broader scale it is hard to condemn her when so much good has been done on many of these issues that the film brings up.

What Dinesh fails to consider is that government regulation, for the most part, is reactive. Regulations are put in place because someone at some point took advantage and someone else suffered for it. To think the american government regulates at whim, just to stick it to people, is just untrue. And in Obama's defense, he not only has the responsibility of leading the American people, but figuring out how to get along with other countries in an ever changing, ever shifting global society. He has been a true leader of the free world, and has performed it greater than any other president during my lifetime. Is he perfect? Of course not. But let he (or she) who is cast the first stone.",1475193600,,1135,4.596059113300493

6482371,1,B00LG7VWIA,"I had believed this was a counter-factual history film; meaning a ""what if"" involving the USA not being involved in World War II or did not fight the Civil War (like Amazon's Great ""The Man in the High Castle"" about the USA losing WWII).  I was wrong.  This is a conservative political film meant to attack the Obama administration.  It has nothing to do with any historical counter-factuals and simply serves as Dinesh D'Souza's political attack on the left in general.  He even puts himself in it, claiming that he was wrongly indicted for campaign finance law breaches (Here's a hint:  if a film maker makes a movie that is also about himself, consider that a warning sign on the content).  His arguments about the ""dark sides"" of US history downplay the racism, violence and bloodshed that actually occurred.  I did like the historical re-enactments though.  Those were well done.",1475020800,,884,4.846666666666667
6482372,3,B00LG7VWIA,Not a bad start to take on Howard Zinn for his negative viewpoint but goes way to far to the right to be believed. It's particularly troubling how he demonizes the president as if there is some evil agenda at work. He takes the viewpoint that we have been pushed into believing a historical narrative of shame in the USA then trivializes major major low points in our history. One example is that he he explains slavery away as being something that that always has been around and that the Irish suffered as much in indentured servitude. No mention of the American corporate greed bringing down the economy. No mention of internment camps or being the only nation to use a neculear weapon much less use one on a civilian population. While It's not a bad thing to see the good in history as long as it's not blindingly good. This is a bit too much right-wing revisionist history taking on left-wing revisionist history and doing a bad job of it.,1474934400,,944,4.526315789473684

Only once the natives were suppressed.  And is Capitalism always good?  It is fine when there is room for growth, but that isn't the current problem in our society.  The problem is that everyone is competing to grow, but there is no more room for growth.  To succeed, companies battle each other.  The entrapreneur builds a better store across the street from the old established store, and sells at prices so low that people no longer shop there.  This is considered fair in Capitalism, but it harms people.  This world is a giant competition, and the people haven't realized that we've lost the competitions  They still believe in unlimited potential.

6482395,3,B00LG7VWIA,"Dinesh D'Souza is the Michael Moore of the right who portrays history in a way that reinforces his biased argument that contemporary liberalism in America conflicts with America's core values. He counters the traditional historic portrayal of the exploits of colonialism from the defeat of Native American tribes, to the enslavement of African Americans, to the battle with Mexico over territories in the southwest, with pointed factual data, for example, ""most Native American deaths occurred as a result of diseases brought by Europeans rather than by conquest,""  or, ""a large number of slave owners were free African Americans and that slavery was an accepted practice in Africa,""  or, ""there is hardly anyone wanting to cross illegally into Mexico, only from Mexico into the US. However, by omission he fails to point out that regardless of whether or not these are revisionist, the unjust institutional practices were government policies implemented by white settlers or the economic policies that encourage illegal border crossings. Also he manages to circumvent the entire civil rights movement of the 20th century, overcoming segregation by moving into contemporary politics by portraying the left as some concerted nefarious plan to empower themselves by taking the otherwise enterprising American spirit to a culture of despair and government dependency. He also proceeds to present counter examples such as an enterprising African American woman who overcame all adversity to become successful, a Mexican-American man who is so glad to be a Texan and not living in Mexico. All in all if you are right-leaning politically, D'Souza's hand-picked facts will reinforce your point of view.",1474761600,,1695,5.44106463878327

6482426,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Informative offering that provides a viewpoint that broadens perspective from the widely accepted but narrow view.  I watched this because of the controversy over the Advanced Placement test for United States History.  There had been a push for the test to align very closely to the ""Howard Zinn"" narrative.  There's always more than one side to the story.  Fortunately, the AP US test didn't change to be so limited.  This film offers a concise explanation as to why.
If you are a devoted liberal, this may be a waste of time for you.  If differs too greatly from the liberal narrative.  If you are very conservative, this may not be conservative enough.

It partly measures up, but mostly fails.  I call it a ""whitewash"" of our history.  The latter part of the movie is a grossly distorted political screed, demonizing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.  Supposedly they are the cause of most modern American government maladies.  This isn't ""whitewash"", it is just pure, unadulterated male-bovine droppings.  Long before Hillary and Barack our country was on its current track, and long after they are both retired we still will be on that track.  We are on that track because our government is controlled by those who have bought access to our congress; and it is not us middle class and lower class citizens.  It is the ultra-rich who have the access, and who control the media, and who decide what we will hear and what we will not hear.  Dinesh D'Souza demonizes the wrong people.",1472601600,2,967,4.883435582822086

6482607,1,B00LG7VWIA,"I tried to watch this piece of right wing commentary. I really tried. But it was too awful to believe. One of my favorite genres of science fiction is alternative history. You know like a time machine delivering modern weapons and artillery to Napoleon at Waterloo. Or a modern American naval fleet appearing at Pearl Harbor on December 7 1941.

In this movie, it was that George Washington was shot by a British sniper and died. As a result, the British win. This is an actually good premise, and with Megadeath playing a heavy metal version of the Star Spangled Banner in the background, I was ready for some good stuff.

Briefly, the movie seemed to be interesting, then it went downhill trying way too hard to ""prove"" American exceptionalism. The outright racism and historical revisionism was so thick, I could barely breathe:

1. The mass depopulation (let's call it for what it is, genocide) of American Indians by Europeans (let's call it for what it is, whites) was blamed on ""accidental transmission of diseases."" Unless you choose to cherrypick some right wing history denialism, nearly every scholar of early American history would dispute this.
2. Hold your breath, because it gets worse. The movie seems to claim that slavery is bad, but because it brought us generations of successful black Americans it wasn't all that bad. Yes, the right wingers behind this film actually state that Martin Luther King would never have become a great man if his predecessors weren't brought here as slaves. Let that sink in. Because I cannot grasp the horrific racism that represents.
3. The movie attempts to paint ""liberals"" as traitors who indict American exceptionalism. All it takes is a brief listen to the Republican and Democratic conventions to understand that liberals have always been the ones who treasure and embrace American exceptionalism.

The producer/director/musical performer/writer of the film is Dinesh D'Souza. He was born in Mumbai, India and came to America in the 1980s as a college exchange student. Ironically, D'Souza would be blocked from coming here by the right wing, because, you know, he's not white. D'Souza is mostly notable as having given illegal political contributions to Republicans, for which he was convicted of a felony, of failed marriage and several public affairs, which lead to his divorce. Does it matter what his background is? Yeah, because it's obvious this movie was some sort of revenge against the Obama administration (you know, because he made another movie attacking President Obama).

D'Souza throws in interviews with Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, failed Republican presidential candidates. After that point, the movie descends into one of those typical anti-Obama screeds that provides us with false equivalencies, rhetorical hyperbole, taking more logical criticisms of Obama and remake them into hate-filled rants, all wrapped in a seamless appeal to a false patriotism. But worse yet, they demonize the patriotic liberals with fearmongering and hate.

One more thing  the battle reenactments were hysterically amateurish. This moves was no Glory or any other civil war movie which had believable and traumatic war scenes. D'Souza, apparently limited in funds, gave us the Revolutionary and Civil War reenactments that were sterile, clean, and apparently not very bloody.

I have a policy of not reading reviews before watching a video on Amazon Prime. I think I might have to change that strategy. This was awful.",1471737600,41,3480,5.157801418439717

(And convicted felon who took a plea-bargain, which specified, among other things, mandatory therapy.) What else did I expect? An attack on various straw-men of political correctness, he supports each claim by finding someone to echo his own invented ""reality"" of what people think in the US. Which only shows that in a nation of 300,000,000 people you can find someone who agrees with you about anything. When he ask a native-America whose last name is ""Whiteface"" (yes) what she thinks when she hears the word ""America,"" she sighs and says ""sadness."" Therefore his notion that all Americans think the nation was built on genocide is affirmed. On to the next straw man! Who is a Hispanic-American living somewhere out west, who says ""I say I AM in Mexico!"" in response to D'Souza's  question ""What do you think when you hear people say ""Go back to Mexico""? The fellow, who clearly bears a grudge that began generations before his birth, means he is in a part of the US that was once in a part of Mexico.

I wonder what Ms. Whiteface would say to that . . . .

D'Souza's America is a land of malcontent defeatists who lie about history and have (therefore?) made this country fail. This includes our president, of course, whom he savaged in an earlier film, the title of which he refers to by a shortened title--""2016."" The full title is ""2016"" Obama's America,"" which, as you might be guessing by now, is a sad, sad place. Which was once great. Trump should snap this up, chop it into little sound bits and put it on the TV.

The lens through which this writer, who came to this country on a scholarship and managed to stay on--a policy he might now deplore--sees the nation that adopted him and gave him citizenship through a lens that is skewed indeed. The ideas that he says are destroying America are not accepted in the mainstream, and are, for the most part, as fringey as his own. His lens is actually a mirror, where everything that he thinks is far left is actually far right. Step away from the mirror, Mr. D'Souza (And you're welcome for the various scholarships and grants I and the rest of my fellow tax-payers gave you! ) and have a look around.

And then he spends the final third of this ""documentary"" building a character assassination of Hilary Clinton using lies, half-truths, and nasty insinuations.

And all of this is D'Souza's right: this is America, after all, and any idiot can say any damn fool thing they want in public, but at the end of the day, what cements my one star rating, is that D'Souza spends 0 minutes of this film imagining the repercussions of the world without America.

Even conspiracy theory movies use bits and pieces of real world information to formulate a hypothesis. This just ignores any kind of logic, and tries to predict the future in a different world.

6482753,5,B00LG7VWIA,I really loved this documentary. This perspective is really refreshing!.,1470441600,,72,6.3
6482754,5,B00LG7VWIA,"In a time of turmoil, when we are fast going downhill as a nation and as a people, yet still innovating and reinventing ourselves, this film presents a different, unique, and refreshing perspective on America as a nation. Rather than being constantly critical, it seeks to set the facts straight and highlight the truth, -the positive force for good, America has been in the world, since it's creation. There is another film I highly recommend. That is entitled: ""Monumental: In Search of America's National Treasure"". I believe that the one ideology that is especially American and should be embraced by all people of the world, is Liberty and a perpetual ever increasing gravitation to the Democratic political system of ""Constitutional Republic"" and moderate conservative Libertarianism: Human rights, Constitutional Rights, and small government by the people and for the people. This is what made America great. This is what established the premise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This film shows that Capitalism as a socio-economic system is still by far, the best system, that most nations of the world are fully embracing. The one area which needs to be expounded on and where I disagree with many so-called ""Conservatives"", is that Capitalism and [many times false] patriotism is the be all, end all.
Capitalism has it's flaws and our nation has it's flaws. Those flaws are greed, fascism, liberalism/communism, and the ever increasing totalitarian/ authoritarian police, surveillance, and security state. Many of the very same industrialists and bankers who contributed to the success of America, (many of whom were European, such as the Rothschild family) were also responsible for it's demise (long after their deaths). Ignorance which has been, and still is perpetrated on the American people, is the enemy. Zionism is the enemy. Fascism and greed is the enemy. Liberalism (which is not really progressive at all) is the enemy. The Federal Reserve System, World Bank, IMF, CFR, Bank for International Settlements, Rothschild Family, Rockefeller Family, Trilateral Commission, United Nations, Wall Street, Bush Family, Cheney Family, Rumsfeld Family, PNAC et. al., the Bilderberg Group, Bloomberg, the Financial Elite etc., and many others individuals and institutions are all the enemy, and/or contributing to the demise and decline of America and the world, by their POWER LUST to control the population and destiny of the world. The New World Order is an occult satanic Zionist Jewish movement based on the premise of ""God's chosen people"" to rule over the earth. I want to make it clear, regardless of those people who are erroneously offended, that I am not anti-Jewish, or racist, in any way. I had growing up and still have Jewish friends who understand the complex nature of the problem, and understand that Zionism is inherently anti-Jewish (no matter what it purports to be). This is not necessarily or simply a Jewish problem, nor are your average Jewish people a problem. Hopefully, they are part of the solution and can be independent thinkers and human beings first and foremost. The problem is Zionists who have become unchallengeable in their inordinate wealth, power, and influence, and believe they are superior to everyone else as a result of achieving the aforementioned results, no matter how they accomplished it. They are the most racist discriminatory people on the face of the earth. The problem is people who blindly support them (such as the millions of Conservative American Christians) without really knowing anything about them or their true agenda. I am just a historian and researcher trying to educate others as Dinesh D'Souza is. We agree on most things and we disagree on others (such as the root causes of problems); but in all issues there needs to be education, discussion, debate, humility, and centerline moderation. The left and the right dichotomy is the classic divide and conquer strategy utilized by our enemies to destroy America and other regions of the world, for their own political and financial gain, and power consolidation.",1470441600,,4103,5.218181818181818
6482755,5,B00LG7VWIA,"There is more and better to the American left than one sees in this film, but it makes an important point. Barack Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton, and a number of other powerful politicians, media executives, and academics are distoting and falsifying our history, not to bring social justice or opportunity, but to destroy our constitutional liberties and impose a reign of terror, a left-wing fascism that will benefit the few, bring misery to the many, and deprive the world of America's promise. This realm of lies already dominates the universities, and has poisoned (or simply closed) millions of minds. Dinesh D'Souza is a true thinker and patriot.

6482758,3,B00LG7VWIA,"Informative, introspective, and worth a viewing. However, it's an inescapable truth that D'Souza has an ax to grind, and he is only passively apologetic about that in about a 5-second soundbite. This truth comprises the balanced perspectives he attempts to offer here, and leaves the very title of this documentary as a mere suggestion. No imagining is done; this is an admittedly biased reflective piece on U.S. history and nothing more. Still, the execution of such was fair in its transparency.",1470268800,,497,5.148148148148148

The points he makes are great and thought provoking. Excellent countering views and arguments to some of the ""American shaming"" ideas that are out there, popular in modern day America.
With that said, I think the title was a little misleading. I really expect an examination of what the world would be like, or even this land of ours like, without America.  Without giving a lot away, he starts off with showing George Washington riding into battle, and being killed. I really thought he was going to explore what would have happened, if America never got started....but that didn't happen in the film.
He brought up so many good, even great arguments, each one could have been a film in itself, i.e., his argument against Howard Zinn's book.
I love my country, but this film felt more like something that would be shown at a political rally to get people hyped. It is filled with great patriotic iconic images and re-enactments of great moments and people in American history....but then kind of fails to push the point.
I understand what he is getting at; Americans are being shamed into thinking that America is bad, the middle class and white people are horrible and the federal government is evil.....but the movie jumps around to so many different ideas and theories that it I never felt as though I was getting the full story.
This seems more like a prologue in the book, before really breaking it down each topic in its own respective chapter.",1469664000,,1518,4.664179104477612

6482855,4,B00LG7VWIA,"It begins with all these 'horrific'  things that America supposedly did, and that it has to be fixed. For example, he has an Indian woman whining about how America took their land and killed their people. There is NO mention of who the Indians got the land from, or how. They killed the native inhabitants, and conquered the land...exactly what the Indians are accusing America of. Of course, that fact is covered up here. Mexicans, who claim to be American citizens, whine that America took half of their country, Mexico, in the Mexican War. Well, again, how did Mexicans get the land to begin with? They took it by conquest, killing and enslaving the natives before them. Finally, this film addresses this. With regards to capitalism, it places the blame where it belongs - the consumer. HOWEVER, what it does not address, is that the U.S. government, as well as any other developed government in the world, has made private success stories that made America great, illegal. Yes, your government is making self-sufficiency illegal. It is making the American Dream illegal. This film covers that up. It rightly accuses the historical rhetoric of ""the shaming of America"" as false, BUT it hides what the governments of the world are doing to oppress the people now. It is slavery all over again, and anyone who goes outside of the corporate-slavery system is a criminal. Basic elements of survival - collecting rainwater, growing food on your own property, living off of the monopoly grid - are illegal in most cities in America. This film does say that everything in America is illegal now, but doesn't say how this is possible, based on history. In 1871, the forty-first congress, third session, chapter LXII, ""An Act to provide a Government for the District of Columbia"", created a CORPORATION called the District of Columbia, and laid out the government for that corporation. That corporate-government was given control of the ten square miles of the District of Columbia, AND the District of Columbia CITIZENS. That is where our slavery began. Instead of being satisfied with ten square miles, the District of Columbia (which has changed its name a number of times - United States of America, United States, UNITED STATES, etc), though fraud, has stolen Americans and made them District of Columbia subjects (U.S. citizens), and through fraud, taken control of the states through shadow governments. The ONLY way to become an American again is to step out of the District of Columbia system. Why doesn't this film address that? Fear? Agenda? Persecution? Who knows, but it is not because of ignorance. Still, it is worth the watch. It is trying to remind people what made America great to begin with, and those values and ideas are worth saving.",1469491200,,2750,4.939524838012959

Many have died in the effort to forge a more perfect union as the decades and centuries have moved us forward as a people, but none of this possible without those visionary fathers of our founding that brought from the darkness the ideas of a free society governed by the people and put them on paper. Our American national anthem is the only one that ends with a question, ""...oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave..."" A question that must be answered by each generation in our American struggle to pursue life, liberty and happiness.

6482904,3,B00LG7VWIA,"""America: Imagine a world Without Her"" is little more than a good looking piece of propaganda, with a very misleading title, falsely pitched as a documentary. Nonetheless, it is a feel-good piece to those who can't stomach the idea that the USA is flawed. That's a shame. Why would anyone deny that we have made many human mistakes since our earliest beginnings, in contradiction to our highest humanist values. We are human, after all. We screw up. Duh! The filmmaker, Dinesh D'Sousa, blows them off by pointing out that the rest of the world is also guilty of them. ""They did it too,"" is a child's excuse. We can not improve if we refuse to admit when we, as a nation and as individuals, are falling short of our ideals.

Needless to say, I respect D'Sousa's right to express his views, and they're certainly thought provoking. However, I believe he has missed one of our greatest virtues, the guaranteed right to dissent, as well as it's necessity. A great deal of our success and esteemed reputation is linked to our right to freely speak up and speak out (of course we don't do that perfectly either). And because many citizens, over the decades, have been wise enough to spot wrong, and courageous enough to expose it and to take action, and because others have the right to follow their lead, our country continues to change and become truer to our founders dreams of freedom and excellence. We have always been and continue to be a great nation, but we all know there is room for improvement.

I also reject the notion that we are no longer great. Comparing the America we have read about or seen in movies (largely fiction), to the vastly complex and often baffling real world, seems simple-minded to me. I also think it's immature to expect the world to be as simple as how we may have perceived it when we were young and understandably naive. Why expect the world to conform the the view we held when we were children or young adults? I don't get it. And don't politicians love to throw that ""Let's make America great again"" straw dog out there to stir up our insecurities and thereby manipulate us (Boo!)? We will never be perfect, yet we remain exemplary.

 Denying our failings, or our excellence, strikes me as irresponsible and an impediment our potential for genuine moral progress, the real key to our nation's particular majesty.

To sum it all up: the film's production is top quality and occasionally, quite impressive. However it's premise is short-sighted disinformation. Kind of like believing that all Republicans are perfect and no Democrat could do a right thing if his life depended on it. But, if that's your view, this is your film.",1469059200,,2662,4.691648822269808

6482913,1,B00LG7VWIA,"This  movie is conservative garbage made by a director who pretends to thoroughly cross-examine the liberal POV with true and convincing arguments. D'Souza knows exactly what he's doing when he inserts what some might call emotional (and I call comedic) montages of crappy actors dressed up as our forefathers and vintage footage of flying planes. While some might call it a reflection of Americas unique accomplishments, I call it manipulative propaganda that attempts to do what conservatives do best- tug at your heartstrings by fear mongering (i.e. all thought of significant American accomplishment will go extinct without a God-fearing conservative in office), and provide a distraction to his movie's blatant lack of complete facts.

Actually, those being interviewed on the liberal side do a more convincing job at being honest, complete, and coherent in their presentation of facts than D'Souza. At least to the discerning viewer.

I disagree with every explaination this guy presents but he did give me a good chuckle, especially in his insertion of the objective (lol) Fox News footage in an attempt to prove his points.  Other times I felt disappointed that so many viewers gave this film such high reviews. I just wish people could see that there is so much more to be said, of great importance, that refute the concessions D'Souza presents.  Do I think he innocently overlooked this? No. I believe it to be a clear example of manipulation.

That would imply a movie about how things would be different around the world if America didn't exist which could be very a very interesting hypothetical movie.  That isn't what this movie is.  This is a movie that takes extremely over simplified examples of bad things that have happened in our history from America haters and counters them with extremely over simplified responses from American lovers explaining how they weren't bad things/our fault.  Slavery wasn't that bad because everybody else did it and hey we also had white slaves(indentured servants) and some black people here also owned slaves so it is ok.  Running Native Americans off their land wasn't a big deal because they were constantly fighting and taking over each others land before we got here.  No we didn't kill most of the Native Americans disease did which this move points out but we didn't help by slaughtering a bunch either.  The last 30 mines of the movie turns into an extreme rightwing Obama/Hilary are bad and trying to destroy the country movie even though a lot of the problems he complains about started under Bush but whatever they are Obama's fault.

6482980,3,B00LG7VWIA,"D'Souza cherry picks his cases the same as he accuses Zinn. D'Souza carefully ignores The slaughter/genocide of the Indian Wars instead attributing the death to the Spanish so-called inadvertently infecting the natives they encountered. He also claims that killing the 1st Nations for lands and reneging on treaties is totally okay because the Nations warred amongst themselves. Slavery - equates it to indentured servitude and justifies it with 'well everyone is doing it'.

I did appreciate his stories about people succeeding in America. I also have some appreciation for the segment on privacy, search/seizure, and criminal justice. It is too bad he chose to present only the Conservative side leaving out the poor, minority, and ""other"" that are also experiencing the same thing.

America has done great evil in the world, but it has also done great good. It is an embarrassment in front all of humanity for D'Souza to whitewash the evils. I wonder why he left India since Great Britain made India what it is today. They used resources and locals to build a great country. All Indians can work hard and become wealthy so long as they have the gumption. And everyone in India is free to live as they choose.  I cannot figure out why he would have wanted to leave. See anyone can cherry pick and ignore grave injustices.

The candidacy of Donald Trump is a direct result of this propaganda, and the parallels that have been drawn between Donald Trump and Adolph Hitler are striking.

6483034,5,B00LG7VWIA,"This is D'Souza's interpretation of the foundation of the United States as we know today.  I could easily leave my review at just that, but he delves beyond what our schools and social media has trained us to believe:  that those of us proud of our American past should be apologetic and shamed of our heritage. The first part of D'Souza's film almost makes me feel he's supportive of what has gone wrong with America. But it's only to confirm what we are told what to believe by today's social media.  He not only provides the point of view of those who believe America has done wrong and condemned other nations and points of view, but rather presents the non-discussed side of why America is great and has been a catalyst for freedom and opportunity.  We don't see this discussed elsewhere.

The media and today's globally-focused society has us trained to condemn what America was created for, and instead adopt an apologetic attitude to how our country has obtained grand status as a global leader. This documentary (backed by facts) has us looking at a radically strange point of view: that maybe the US isn't a tyrant, but rather a catalyst of opportunity.

Is America imperialist; yes it is.  Is America obsessed with guns and violence.  You betcha.  But with all of its faults, it is still the best idea on the planet.

6483040,1,B00LG7VWIA,"Like other critical reviewers have pointed out, this film amounts to little more than a misleading piece of propaganda. It attempts to defend American ideals while rejecting the notion America has ever done anything wrong. It claims to take a fact-based approach to history, yet draws its conclusions mostly through fallacious reasoning and justifications.

For example:

Anecdotal Fallacy (using a personal experience or an isolated example instead of sound reasoning or compelling evidence) - i.e., the film maker's own story of coming to America and ""making it,"" or the Mexican-American man from Texas in the film who says he'd rather move somewhere else in America if Mexico ever reclaimed some of its lost lands. These are compelling and understandable pro-American arguments, but fail to address the underlying questions of justice posed by the film-maker himself at the beginning of the film.

Fallacies of Composition and Division (assuming that something true of part of a whole must also be true of the whole; assuming that something true of a thing must also be true of all or some of its parts) - the film-maker tells us of a specific few entrepreneurs who ""made it,"" such as the father of the Mexican-American man from Texas, and Madam C.J. Walker (first female self-made millionaire in America). The role of luck, circumstance, and/or preferential advantage are downplayed while good ole' ""hard work"" is cited as the primary ingredient of success. The message was, ""if capitalism worked for these people then it must work for everyone."" I'm an entrepreneur myself and a big fan of hard work - currently running two businesses and pushing hard to grow - but I also recognize that not everyone is born with the same talents, skills, or abilities, and that luck and circumstance absolutely play a role in success. I've lost relatively small deals that I worked very hard on, and won huge deals that came to me almost by accident. There is no doubt hard work is important and virtuous, but it's only one of many ingredients that lead to success. Fact is, capitalism doesn't work for everyone equally even if they work hard. The film maker would have done better by simply stating ""life isn't fair"" rather than to subtly imply anyone who hasn't ""made it"" isn't working hard enough.

Appeal to Authority (argues that a position is true or more likely to be true because an authority or authorities agree with it) - the film-maker introduces us to a number of authority figures to support his positions throughout the film, such as Ted Cruz (the recent presidential candidate from Texas who has now dropped out of the race). These appeals are clearly biased, and accomplish little more than to cause the intelligent viewer to feel increasing skepticism and distrust for the film and film-maker.

Red Herrings (a speaker attempts to distract an audience by deviating from the topic at hand by introducing a separate argument the speaker believes is easier to speak to). Immediately after the beginning portion of the film, during which the ""arguments against America"" are introduced, the film launches into a pro-capitalism section that completely fails to address the arguments made minutes before. Notably, the film does eventually does attempt to address those original arguments. However, the flow is very haphazard and leads the viewer to feel they are being manipulated, and the core of the original arguments are never truly addressed. There is a pattern of quickly dismissing the original argument in favor of redirecting the viewer's attention to something else that would appear to justify the matter, distract from it, or prove it false by cherry picking ""facts"" from history that (supposedly) undermine the basis of the original argument altogether.

Consider how the film treats the matter of slavery. The film hails the true America as that which ended slavery, seemingly dismissing the idea that America was ever involved in the slave trade. Huh....? In case we aren't satisfied by this, the film also points out free blacks had slaves back in the day, and suggests white indentured servitude might have been even worse than slavery, which is supposed to mean...what exactly? This reminds me of the kid who gets in trouble on the playground for throwing rocks at his fellow classmate, claiming to justify it by saying ""...but little Johnny was doing it too! And he was throwing even bigger rocks!"" It's tough to imagine how anyone could take this seriously. Frankly, this part of the film was difficult to understand, but it seemed like the film-maker was suggesting African Americans have nothing to complain about given these things.

Notably, there were a few points in this film I did agree with - such as how we contributed to the creation of ISIS, or how the insurance companies have benefited from Obamacare (wouldn't it be nice if the services provided by your business were deemed mandatory by the federal government?). On these points I think the film did a good job. However, the ultimate message of this film was that America can do no wrong - that our **** smells like flowers, and that every wrong we've committed was either justified or not committed at all.",1467417600,4,5194,4.990762124711316

The facts to support this claim were so mangled with fiction, lies and conjecture, viewers are left wondering if it is a spoof of the right wing. Historically inaccurate assertions about the indigenous communities are flat out racist. For instance, D'Souza claims that First Nation peoples were grateful to Europeans settlers for saving them. In addition, he asserts that slavery was approved by African-Americans. This mockumentary--I sincerely hope it is--fails to mention starvation during the Trail of Tears or the murders of men, women and children that resisted slavery.

In this film, Dinesh D'Souza, an immigrant to ""America"" (short for the United States of America), shows his gratitude for this great country by sharing historical, statistical reasons why everyone in the Free World should be grateful for this country, and why people in countries who may not be considered part of the Free World should join us.

Having returned to college since retiring from the U.S. military in 2010, and having attended various colleges in Los Angeles, including Westwood, DeVry, and the University of Phoenix, I see how educators seem to spend less time educating their students, and too much time inculcating in their students the concept that, and I quote my professors, ""Americans suck everything!"" and Republicans should not call themselves Christians because they are uncharitable warmongers.

This documentary answers the accusations made against ""America"" in school, and does so in a thoughtful, respectful, professional, well educated manner.

Any administration in office can abuse his or her power when it comes to spying on people.  Heck, Nixon did but we also have proof he did.

I watched about 85% of the movie before I could take no more. It just got increasingly worse.

6483176,1,B00LG7VWIA,"How can someone who immigrated to the U.S. from India 30 years ago understand what it was like growing up in the 1950's and 1960's in America - this film proved that Mr. D'Souza doesn't understand our social history as much as he thinks he does and has probably been fed the hard-line conservative Republican philosophy since he arrived here.

When I was growing up and going a variety of different schools across the U.S., I naively assumed that there were no black kids in my school or living in my neighborhood because they chose not to.  I didn't know about segregation and thought that there was no real race issue because slavery ended with Lincoln's Emancipation Proclomation in the 1860's.  Our school books were white-washed and never challenged students with the issues of war, race relations, imperialism, etc.  And my idea of Native Americans was formed by cowboy movies of the era (and earlier) that depicted the Indians as savages and the white man as innocent and fighting the Indian warriors to save their lives.

While I don't agree with the entire philosphy of people like Howard Zinn - who is one of the antagonists in the film - I have to credit him for being one of the people who helped expose the truth about our history and dispellthe fairy tale history we were taught in school in the '50's and 60's.

Other issues with the film are about the accuracy of some facts such as indentured servitude. The film shows actors reprenting white people in England being chased down, abducted and forced into servitude in America as if that is comparable to slavery of blacks.  If any of that happened it was a rare occurrence and it seems suspicously similar to the men who were shanghaid and forced to serve on 18th & 19th century ships.  Indentured servitude was a common method for poor whites in Britain and Ireland to get to America.  In exchange for passage, they agreed to work for someone in the U.S. for a pre-agreed on number of years.  They got free passage, learned a trade and received room and board.  At the end of the service, they were free to go on with their lives - not like slavery at all.

Mr. D'Souza also explains away the idea of genocide of Indians by correctly stating that many died from disease contracted because they had no immunities to the diseases the Europeans brought to the New World.  That was true in the early years but the displacement of natives by force was also a method for white settlers to expand westward.  He compares it to the Black Plague the killed millions in Europe because they had no immunity to the disease when it arrived from Asia and he states that it was called genocide at any time.  One major difference is that Asians hadn't arrived in Europe to take their land and brought the disease with them.

And lastly, the films spends a lot of time with Alexis De Tocqueville and makes a point of mentioning that De Tocqueville, in his book ""Democracy in America"", stated that, in America, religion must be considered as the ""first of its political institutions"".  It is presented as if De Tocqueville had meant it as a compliment, but if one were to read his book, they would find an earlier paragraph where he states ""religion prevents them (Americans) from imagining everything, and keeps them daring everything"".  Mr. D'Souza must not be aware of our founding fathers need to keep religion seperate from government.",1465603200,,3389,4.657718120805369

6483185,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Dinesh D'Souza is a true hero in regards to going against the status quo. In this film he explores the ripe internal hate that flourishes in various groups in America, not because they experienced slavery or the Trail of Tears first hand, and not because they are presently oppressed, but because they were taught to hate collectively as a result of mainstream propaganda that intentionally leaves out taboo truths.

I personally learned a number of interesting topics that were taught to me in a one-sided fashion through my entire education. For instance, I recall Madam C. J. Walker as rising from slavery to become the first female millionaire in America, but I was never taught she was also an owner of slaves herself, as were many other popular African Americans in history once they were freed. All throughout school - from the time I was a child in public school to college - we weren't taught about Africans owning slaves once they were free. This was strictly pushed off as a one-sided event that only white's perpetuated.

Secondly, we weren't taught the horrors of indentured servitude and how many indentured servants were kidnapped, nor that there were more indentured servants than slaves for the majority of time throughout history. We were taught year after year that they owed a debt that the individuals themselves racked up and servitude was a form of repayment. We were taught that they had significantly better living conditions, and we were certainly never taught they worked side by side with African slaves and that many died and/or had their original length of servitude extended when they lived. We weren't taught this because that would go against the mainstream narrative that consistently perpetuates slavery was a one-sided atrocity committed by racist whites against Africans. Dinesh does a great job at covering this.

There's so much more to learn throughout this movie. I strongly urge anyone who's interested in hearing a real viewpoint to watch it. It has one of the highest ratings on Amazon for a reason.",1465516800,4,2043,4.9853372434017595

6483188,5,B00LG7VWIA,There are many charges being leveled against America from a large number of sources some of which have at least the appearance of scholarly authority. Fortunately when viewed under even the light set scrutiny both the accuser and the charge are seen for what they really are. For those unfamiliar with the writings of Saul Alinsky many of the things that have happened over the last few decades may seem to be coming out of nowhere. Yet thelse are classic radical leftist propaganda and tactics. Making young people feel ashamed of the history of this country and demand change is basic to the wholesale changing of America and American systems. The beginning of this movie states many of the charges against the U.S. straight from the mouths of many of the accusers. If left unchallenged these charges would be enough to make anyone take to the streets to bring about change. This work not only challenges the charges but reveals why they are even being made and what is hoped by those making the charges.

Everyone seemed to agree that we were the best, the most giving, the most fair, the beneficiaries of a great and benevolent Constitution, a shining city on a hill. But like Lincoln said, we have to be wary of the enemy within.  Could the new feeling of national shame actually be a concerted effort to undermine capitalism and extinguish our light?  The part of this film on Hillary Clinton was particularly interesting to me.  Kids do all kinds of goofy things in college.  Writing a thesis on Saul Alinsky doesn't necessarily mean anything, even if you add on a letter of admiration and intimations of further contact.  But it does make you wonder.  Could NAFTA and the driving up of our national debt, coupled with a concerted effort to increase division, actually be part of a greater plan?

His whole premises of black Americans claim of injustice about slavery is to focus on the fact there were 300 hundred or so black slave holders but ignores the millions of slaves held in bondage.  This is called sweeping things under the rug.  As for the Mexican American war even US Grant who was a junior officer in that war said ""one of the most unjust...ever waged by a stronger nation against a weaker nation,"" an act more reminiscent of ""European monarchies"" than a democratic republic. Dinesh, you need to do more research.  While he somewhat tries to produce both sides of the arguments in the end he uses a heavy handed singular, very narrow view of the conclusion to the issues he tries to make.

History is a collection of perspectives, but this director picks and chooses perspectives and calls them facts, implying that all other interpretations are wrong or incomplete.  He repeatedly uses isolated examples without context, ignoring when there are large differences in magnitude between two examples.  Classic case, isolated stories of financial success do not excuse years of systematic oppression that have targeted marginalized groups.  Lastly, he contributes to the paranoia of conspiracy theories surrounding current political figures, such as Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton.  The only person shaming our nation is the delusional director whose purpose is to erode confidence in the government, undermine the current administration while praising the administrations that brought us the Vietnam war, Iraq War, etc.  The saddest part is that too many Americans will watch this and feel that what happened to the indigenous populations, African slaves, etc. was justified.",1464393600,8,1240,5.701086956521739

DSouza makes several good points in this documentary, but I think that over intellectualizing this film is somewhat akin to missing the filmmaker's point. Americans need their information meted out in registered doses for them to assimilate and process it in a cohesive manner. The message was effective in making me aware of some of my own shortcomings, of how I tend to blame the ""system"" for failures, when it really is within my power to change my situations. For that reason, I found this film to be effective. DSouza also confirms things I have suspected for a long time, such as how George Orwell's ""Big Brother"" is our own creation and we give away our privacy freely and with abandon, in spite of the consequences. I used to joke that ""everything is illegal"" and that has become truth more than fiction. I have always scoffed at Columbus Day, joking with friends that we have a day off every year for a guy who discovered Cuba and either enslaved or killed all the native people he came in contact with (the Vikings in actuality discovered North America). Then there was the valuable counterpoint that hundreds of thousands of American soldiers died in a fight over the ending of slavery, which was a unique moment in history. The anecdote that many slave owners in the South were themselves of African descent was a shock, but not surprising. Slavery is a very ugly part of the human condition and although progress and enlightenment dictate that things like this must change, sometimes changes take much longer than expected, and in the meantime, we tend to lose focus and digress into an environment of blaming and finger pointing. What is the ultimate message? Pull yourself together, because the United States of America was founded based on that inalienable rightand you will not get a better chance anywhere else.",1463875200,2,1911,4.829268292682927

The variables are astronomical to the point of being INCALCULABLE. It is not as simple as saying ""If we did not invade this, X would have happened"". Why ? Because we do not just scratch our heads, flip a coin and dive in. There are months, years, of events that lead up to an invasion. So, in order to make a flippant prediction that bears ANY chance of reliability, you would have to back trace EVERY EVENT that lead to the final decision...INCLUDED those micro events. Like Charlie Wilson's war. If Charlie Wilson had not read that associated Presses story on the Soviets in Afghanistan then you could say the involvement of US funds would have been limited or delayed...YOU COULD NOT say it would have changed anything as the US could have been involved later, still funding, still creating terrorists that one day bite us in the butt....WHAT YOU CAN SAY is that if X did not happen, then Z would not have happened ""then"".

So, in order to, say, remove ourselves from Iraq means we would have to have a stable oil source from other nations that was not being leveraged for power, putting the CIA in the position to effect change in Iraq in the 50s or the Military backing the coupe in Iraq in 1941

6483336,5,B00LG7VWIA,"D'Souza is the Paul Revere of our day warning us of the dangers of historical revisionists and their socialist liberal ideology shaming and intimidating Americans to adopt their ideology. This film does not portray a dystopian version of history if America never existed, but examines historical attacks on the character and nature of America as a force for good in the world. Dinesh D'Souza makes some bold political assertions and presents counterarguments to the systemic socialist shaming of America in recent history. While this film was widely criticized by mainstream movie critics, most conservative audiences will probably appreciate this film. How you respond to this film probably says more about your own ideological biases than the arguments that are presented.  It is not surprising that most mainstream movie critics rejected this film as partisan because the majority of them have a liberal ideological bias. They are intolerant of anything that presents a counter perspective from their unchallenged pre-suppositional beliefs they have adopted from their liberal college indoctrination.

DSouza presents the common attacks on America to shame its citizenry in order to achieve social change. Liberals accuse the US of stealing the land from the Native Americans and Mexico, oppressing slaves, and stealing resources around the world through wars and greedy capitalism. DSouza spends too much time exploring the myopic and one-sided accusations and not enough time presenting additional perspectives and he leans too heavily on Alexis de Tocqueville. There are far more examples and evidence for the good that America has provided to the world such as: charitable organizations, giving and humanitarian assistance around the world compared to other nations, relative global security and stability compared to the wars and deaths prior to US hegemony, increased global prosperity and wealth creation. A simple question to ask is to give examples of other nations who have stood against tyranny, oppression, and atrocities in the world besides the United States. The truth is that if the US does not take leadership, no other nation stands up to do the right thing. Just look at Armenia, Germany, Bosnia, Rwanda, Darfur, and ISIS. Certainly America has problems, but we should all make sure that we take a critical look at anyone trying to revise history.",1463616000,22,2369,5.382749326145553

He draws poor conclusions from little evidence, at one point even saying the Indentured Servants were primarily poor children rounded up on the streets of London and forcibly sent to America, basically as slaves.

D'Souza paints a positive picture of why America is exceptional and should be cherished; however, it falls short in uncovering the treachery of The US's first post-american President.

He paints a very pretty history of our country that most Americans, including myself, would love to claim. But can we? I can see how the patriotism this film evokes might lead one to believe the author's spin on history. Americans are a great people. We don't have to try to erase or ignore past mistakes to love our country and it's people. Instead, why not learn from those mistakes and become even greater? I'm not a democrat and did not particularly care that this film for some reason devolves into an attack of Obama. So, if you are anti-Obama, then by all means watch this film for entertainment purposes. Just don't forget to think critically and question the history presented.

6483407,1,B00LG7VWIA,"To make things perfectly clear: I am not of the belief that the world would be a better place without America. It would be a worse place. But I believe that D'Souza's film is a deeply flawed presentation of this belief that will do nothing to convince anyone who doesn't already believe that America has been a major force for good in world history.

So, I am no leftist America hating liberal. I am, however, a lifelong student of military history, an attorney, and a cognitive scientist. And I turned this film off because it sets up a ridiculous strawman to argue against, and attempts to paint those who understand American history and human nature into a position where they must deny historical fact or be charged with desiring the destruction of the United States.

D'Souza starts off with his list of his leftist America hating liberal ""indictments"" that the United States has been ""charged"" with. This framework attempts to induce doubt in the mind of the viewer as to whether these indictments are true or not. This is an absurdity because these are all well established facts.

Indictment 1: Genocide of the Native Americans. Um...how many Native Americans have you seen around? From the very earliest history of the Americas, Europeans have been in conflict with Native Americans. To be more specific, the Norse who attempted to settle in what is now eastern Canada. They lost there, but established the first European colony in the Americas in eastern Greenland that lasted for about 500 years, dying while Columbus and others were arriving further south.

From the writings of Columbus and every other early migrant to the Americas, there was no question in their minds as to what was to occur: the Native Americans were to be either assimilated or exterminated. The very earliest documents from the English and Dutch who would form the ethnic and cultural foundation for the United States detail conflicts with the Native Americans when those Native Americans refused to be ""civilized"" or remove themselves from the land they occupied.

For those confused by the mention of the Dutch, the Atlantic coast from Delaware to Connecticut and the Hudson River valley were colonized by the Dutch. Henry Hudson was English, but sailed for the Dutch. And throughout the 17th century the Dutch and the English had a love-hate relationship, literally ranging from inviting the Dutch royal family to rule the UK to a series of naval conflicts that ultimately resulted in the English acquiring the Dutch North American colonies. To a good extent, one can trace the difference between New York and Boston and Virginia to the fact that the Dutch founded and governed New York while the English founded the others.

There was no doubt in the minds of Americans, in government, as economic leaders, as humble citizens, that the ""Native American question"" be solved through assimilation, extermination, or by creating reservations for those who could survive the trip. This was official policy up to the 1920s, when the last of the Apache were forced into submission.

It was only when America stepped into the international scene in the role of ""savior of Western society"" that this subject was somewhat forgotten, because it wasn't exactly consistent with the newly ""noble savior"" role. More minimized by not speaking about it, which was easy to do when no Native Americans were encountered throughout the country outside reservations. Well, they were, but they were forbidden to express those cultural identities through the educational system and through violence, which, at the time, was part of the educational system. This started to change in the late 1960s when some Native Americans in the upper Great Plains rebelled from their government run reservations and indoctrinations and engaged in a series of protests, some violent, some not, culminating in the occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Washington DC. Native Americans were in the news, and Americans who had heard stories that a grandparent or great-grandparent was from a Native American culture, or of mixed race, started viewing this heritage with something other than shame. It was from this point on that liberalization of the treatment of Native Americans under the law commenced.

These are facts, not indictments. The weight of the evidence is literally mountainous. It was fully admitted for centuries. The ""revisionism"" charge that often gets hurled at people who bring these facts up actually belongs to the generations who dominated American culture in the mid 20th century and those who were raised to respect these people as guardians of American prestige.

However, this is not unique to America. Every nation that exists was created by certain groups engaging in violent conquest of other groups in a geographical area, generally followed by forced acceptance of cultural practices and language. China, Brazil, Australia, Thailand, Russia, even nations as tiny as Luxembourg. Troubled thoughts about these practices can be found in documents thousands of years old.

As an example from a person held in high esteem by Western society, Charles the Great, whose life of warfare and conquest was generally consider to be a good thing for European civilization, found the Germanic Sachsen tribes to be violently and persistently unwilling to submit to Frankish rule. After decades of battle, Charles the Great finally conquered the Sachsens, but engaged in outright vengeful slaughter of several thousand while doing so. This act was considered to be extremely troubling at the time by other leaders and by Charles himself. It remained a concern about his earthly legacy, and the destination of his soul as a Christian, up to his death. This is is factual history. It is as much a fact as the arguments in Washington DC and throughout the country regarding Andrew Jackson's decision to expel the Cherokee from their home in the southeast US to obtain the gold and other mineral wealth in that territory. The Cherokee had adopted Christianity and western clothing, had created an alphabet and published newspapers and books, truly desired to become part of mainstream American society - and Jackson was willing to destroy this so that his political supporters could enrich themselves monetarily.

Of course, many admirers of Charles the Great do their best to ignore his slaughter of the Sachsens, or to find an external reason for its necessity, or to blame the Sachsens for it, just as do admirers of Jackson with regard to his genocidal assault on the Cherokee.

Again, this sort of conquest and genocide was generally accepted well into the 20th century. However, two trends changed things. First, the acceptability of this was growing weaker as minority groups regained some control over their lives and rights. They read the words of the founding documents of the nations of the Americas and Europe, saw the expressions of ""universal rights"", and saw them to be in conflict with other parts where the ""universal"" was modified to exclude slaves, women, the use of Catalan, claiming that you were a Sorb or a Sioux, and so on.

The other was that the ability of technology to produce genocide on a massive scale in a brief time with near-instant communication of the events prevented ignorance of the slow-moving exterminations of the past. Stalin may have said that a million deaths is a statistic, but even he knew that 10 million deaths were no such thing. His genocide against the Ukrainians in the 1930s had to be minimized if not denied. The Blitzkrieg and industrialization of death by Hitler's Germany shocked the world in a way that the similar actions of Napoleon Bonaparte a century earlier could not - though Napoleon's campaign of conquest and cultural destruction was incredibly fast for his time. The genocidal actions of Imperial Japan could not be fully erased - they were too proud of it, took too many detailed notes. Nor could the actions of the Chinese communist governments following the war.

The obvious similarities between the American and colonial extermination of Native Americans and their cultures to those of the dictators of the 20th century could not be fully denied. But valiant attempts were made. Hitler and Stalin did it to other civilized white people, not barbarian heathens who lived like animals. It was necessary to create the nation, and the nation saved the world, therefore it must be accepted as good. But let's just not focus on it. If you do, you make America look bad.

That's the problem with D'Souza: he is attempting to label anyone who wants to discuss the unhappy facts of American history as being someone who wishes that America not exist, someone who hates all of America. This is why he immediately turns to a Native American activist whose ancestors within memory were victims of American policy. This is like asking a rape victim how she feels about her rapist.

The real questions, the difficult questions, are for the rest of us. America was created by the genocide of the Native cultures. Violence against Native Americans was part of US governmental policy through the 1970s. But that does not mean that anyone who recognizes this would prefer that America not exist. The conundrum is that America does exist, and that America has done very many good things, very important good things, things that have altered the world for the better in immense ways. But it was built on the worst of crimes, as were all nations.

D'Souza desperately wants to find a way to make it seem like these things didn't happen, that America-haters are making them up, that they are seeking to empower our enemies through our lies. Because he doesn't know how to reconcile his love for America with its crimes.

I don't either. I don't think anyone does. I don't know if this is something that can be done. Perhaps people in the future will find a way to make the moral dissonance cease. Perhaps it will be a dark part of our collective minds forever. Perhaps that is what it should be.

But it happened. And you are not seeking the destruction of America by being aware of its history.

As for the next two ""indictments"", stealing half of Mexico and deriving substantial benefits that last to this day from the slavery of millions of Africans, those are true as well. You can read the contemporary documents where it was flat out admitted. You can read the contemporary documents where it was debated. You can read the contemporary documents where it was denounced.

And you can read the documents of the mid 20th century where these things were, well, white-washed. And you can watch films like D-Souza's that continue to whitewash history. But history is dirty and you get dirty when you work with it.

However, if you deny it, then it will be easier for people like D'Souza to convince you that anything that Americans seek to do is noble and for the best interests of the country and the world without asking important questions. Many Americans seek to do things that they know are ignoble, that they know are not in the best interest of the world or the country. Many of them seek to make those things acceptable by making questioning them unacceptable.",1462147200,83,11196,4.95682302771855

To that end, this movie only brings these issues to the stage, but does not address any solutions beyond the idea that it is Hillary who ""solved"" how to bring socialist democracy into the mainstream and Obama who is enforcing it through executive orders (which by the way Obama has evoked more EOs than any other president before him). If we see Hillary as President elect in JAN 2017 it will be interesting to see how the once who ""solved"" puts things into motion.

6483456,2,B00LG7VWIA,"I was hoping for an interesting alternative reality sci-fi historical fiction movie about what the world might be like if America never existed, but that's not what this is.  It's basically just a pro-America propaganda film filled with inaccuracies, biased opinions and sappy background music.  Best described as a feel good movie for those who want to reinforce their belief in American exceptionalism.

The basic premise is that ""Conquest is Universal"", in other words every country has been trying to conquer and enslave every other country forever, and since that's the rule, it isn't fair to blame the US for the native American genocide, wars of conquest, or for slavery. Instead America should be commended for being the first country to abolish slavery (yes Dinesh is apparently that ignorant and seems to think that America did it first) and being generous enough to allow Indians to live on reservations instead of just killing them all, because making treaties is a much better alternative to conquest (even though diplomacy can be conquest by other means)

It goes down the list attempting to justify or excuse many of the darkest blots of American history.  For example, the native Americans really died off from disease which wasn't anyone's fault, and their land never really belonged to them anyway.  In Vietnam the US Government was sincerely trying to ""liberate"" the Vietnamese people and had the best intentions (He's obviously never heard of the Pentagon Papers).  This claim is backed up by an interview with one veteran who says ""Yes I really did believe that we were helping the Vietnamese people"" and apparently that's enough evidence for Dinesh so he never bothers to interview a second veteran who may have a different opinion. The best one is when he points out that thousands of black people also owned slaves, which apparently according to Dinesh somehow makes it OK (He never bothers to explain why this fact makes it better, I assume he's trying to prove that slavery in the US wasn't race based because he also spends considerable time talking about white indentured servants)  He also shows a story about a black woman who became a successful entrepreneur as ""proof"" that racism doesn't exist and the American dream has always been open to everyone willing to work hard.

Needless to say everything is glossed over very quickly without detail, because details and facts would entirely undermine his premise, which is basically that America is the most awesome thing the planet has ever known and people like Howard Zinn are crazy, stupid, communists for criticizing it.  For instance, he discussed Columbus very briefly and mentions that some slaves were taken back to Spain.  He makes no mention of the fact that the entire population of Hispaniola was annihilated.  This same pattern of glossing over facts is done throughout the movie which culminates with a sappy speech from Bono about how awesome America is.

I didn't give it one star because It is educational in the sense that it helps us understand where the belief in American exceptionalism comes from, and the mental gymnastics required to believe in it.",1459814400,3,3151,5.013409961685824

6483465,3,B00LG7VWIA,"He made some obvious points but like a lot of propagandists left or right lies or ignores facts that might contradict with its agenda. His worship of Lincoln is over the top ""is seen from the Douglas debates did not"" Lincoln's remarks on the white race being superior to the black something he never back down from despite the nonsense by Lincoln apologists. Also the obviously is not aware that the New England slave shipping states were equally adamant about slavery continuing at the time the Constitution was written as were the deep South slave states.

There never was a war fought to free the slaves there was a war to preserve the union and award of southern independence from their perspective, but freeing the slaves was an unintended consequence. Everywhere except Haiti slaves were freed without the necessity of bloodshed. There is no mention of big Pharma, and a hedge fund crisis being caused by out-of-control capitalism, made it sound like it was due to socialism. That being said made excellent points concerning wars of conquest etc.

I have direct ancestors going back to the Mayflower in Jamestown, not to mention numerous Civil War soldiers on both sides. They certainly weren't saints are where they Savage oppressors either. Problem with this kind of argument on both sides as it mirrors the demonization that goes on today between the radical left in the radical right.

Marcus Garvey said that something died at Appomattox that had no right to die, and he wasn't referring to slavery obviously he was referring to Jeffersonian democracy. There are many that argue with some merit, that Lincoln was the beginning of big government and the corporate plutocracy.

But as for the philosophy behind the movie I prefer neither to be poisoned by the cyanide of the left or the arsenic of the right. I have to give them credit for articulating his position and making some points very clearly.",1459123200,,1911,4.888888888888889

There are people these days who want to drum up the past and make us feel badly about it.  WE did not do the things that they complain about.  We have worked hard to create good lives for ourselves and others. The current leaders of the country blame successful people for being successful, and allow those who choose to commit crimes, leave the free education that is already provided for them on the backs of those who work to pay taxes, and generally cause chaos, to undermine the basic tenants of what makes this country great.

First off I teared up at few points in the movie, very powerful!!  Dinesh use's perfect straight to the point tactics to pose ""here is the accusation."" and ""Here is the factual answer.""  This movie actually provided me a much needed encouragement and rebirth to one of mine and so many others like me most basic God-given and birthed  core belief's; I love America!  I shouldn't feel shame in saying that I Love America, but lately and seemingly increasingly we core American's are so bombarded by insanity bombs consistently telling, hinting and reenforcing ""how bad we Americans are"" that we may as well jump on top of the a grenade before ever trying to challenge the direction.  And the scary more apparent growing revelation is that now, more so tomorrow and even more the next, that you or anyone against their agenda, should be ostracized and/ or prosecuted by any means necessary should you choose not to ""willingly"" but truthfully reluctantly jump on their insanity grenade of ""agenda.""
So Thanks Dinesh, Bravo Sir! I hope your story and view of our great nation reaches everyone in the world! You gave me much needed relief from the constant bombardment all around me that I am and America is bad... We are NOT bad, what America is and has unquestionably demonstrated what America is really about, our core belief's are currently, unanimously and in actuality the Best this world has ever embraced... And do Embrace that fact, and Proud-fully promote and encourage America's founding belief's! Embrace and feel Proud of America's historical track record! Do not dwell on the negative but universally reciprocated past tragedies, But Embrace and learn from them  and by doing so, not only do atrocities become corrected, they add character and strengthen those who unite and hold true to the core belief's of this little thought, that is and was this dreamt up idea that is ""America.""",1454371200,2,2065,4.933717579250721

They just get VISA somehow, some without hard work, come here without understanding this country and it's history and end up saying bad things about it.
I am great believer of American Dream and have been in many debates and arguments with stupid people and idiot friends who are against it.
After I saw this documentary, I just tell such people to F off and give them link to this documentary.

I have learned about US culture and it's history and I believe it's best in the world.
I think America and Americans are the only ones who bring new things and innovations to the world. World would have gone to stone age without them.

6483593,1,B00LG7VWIA,This is an extremely misguided documentary that mixes fact and fiction in a rather entertaining fashion. I had to fast forward in a few places as it was so widely inaccurate it almost made me ill. Let us hope that the makers of this documentary some day wake up to the true realities of what America means as a country and that the very fact that such a documentary which is filled with political bias can be produced and shown in America is proof that their accusations are false. If America was what they pretend that it is then this movie wouldn't even be allowed. S,1452038400,6,569,4.377358490566038

6483595,5,B00LG7VWIA,"This film caters to both sides. Everyone needs to see it! It appears to me unbiased in the fact that one can choose what is right and what is wrong, regardless of political party, race, affiliation, or opinion. I don't think it's any different than the elementary school playground, the world is just a bigger playground, and we deal with bigger bullies and bigger ideas and bigger disappointments than a young child. But it's the same relationship.

Anyone is tempted to be a bully, because of fear, power, skill, envy, security, peace, the pursuit of happiness! It's a combination of factors. That temptation is real for anyone who has the power to influence others, because anybody wants a part in something valuable. It's a temptation for America. This film is about using the temptations of being a bully, using the innate influence we have as individuals, and becoming a hero instead. Or even recognizing a bully from a hero.

It's unfortunate that the road to being a bully appears more rewarding and effective at first. But everyone knows in the end the bully never wins. Shame, coercion, and manipulation to get what we want regardless of good intent will fade and be exposed in rotten truth. It is selfish. We cannot be lovers of our own selves! Therefore the bullies around us, and most importantly the bully within us, cannot be favored. The principles and rights of American foundation, not necessarily the people, are what We The People must choose. That is where powerful moments of American heros will be created, to stand up against bullies inside or outside our country.",1451865600,,1588,4.856088560885609

6483647,5,B00LG7VWIA,"BRILLIANT!!!!!!!! This work dismantles every single major case against America! It feels really good to be enlightened by someone whose as credible as D'Souza! Propaganda and Agenda-Pushing are some of the ways to de credit the united states but D'souza shares BOTH sides and begins unravel the ideaology of anti-american rhetoric. You'll FALL IN LOVE with America again once you take on this perspective and see the REAL TRUTH behind the veil of progressivism.

No matter if you even agree or disagree with Dinesh's politics, this film is not only informative but VERY inspiring - as is America herself! Love it!!!",1447804800,,615,5.089108910891089
6483648,5,B00LG7VWIA,"The reenactment scenes are overly sentimental and poorly made, but the sentiment and the arguments of this documentary are outstanding. Dinesh D'Souza is obviously very smart but I believe he ""dumbs down"" his material when presenting in to the general public in his documentaries. I also feel he pulls punches so he will not be criticized as much by his opponents.  As a result, this movie, and 2016, do not have the dramatic punch they could have were the full force of the truth to be laid out.  I would give this movie three stars, entirely for style, not for content,  if there were anything like it out there to compare it to, but since it stands alone as the sole defender of logic and good sense in the debate on American exceptionalism, it deserves every bit of 5 stars.  A must watch for anyone genuinely interested in understanding what they are talking about when critiquing the U.S.",1447804800,,894,4.639240506329114

I've never written a review for any movie. This is my first one and I was pretty humbled, to say the least, by the bait and switch approach.

6483725,5,B00LG7VWIA,I like the way D'Souza gets the viewpoint from other people that probably disagree with him and the calm way he presents it in the movie.  He doesn't try to embarrass the person in the interview he just wants to hear their side and present it in the movie.  He lets the viewer decide about the issue that is brought up.  One eye-opener for me from the movie was when he shows the number of blacks in the Civil War era who owned slaves.  I had no idea!  I have never heard of the fact that many blacks were actually slave owners and I am well into my middle aged years.  The movie just reaffirms what I have known for years that America is a great country and we are a blessed nation.,1444176000,,683,4.097744360902255

The first few minutes hinted at an interesting exploration of the concept of what the title implies.  But I would not even call this a movie in any real sense.  It is a political statement that at the end turns into something more like democrat bashing.

6483735,4,B00LG7VWIA,Good presentation of America as the 'great experiment'.  Dinesh's premise that the world would be much worse off without America is well defended.  It's exhausting hearing and seeing the United States portrayed as the evil empire on a daily basis.  The movie does a good job of applying a dose of reality to those arguments.,1443744000,,324,4.8545454545454545
6483736,1,B00LG7VWIA,"I was hoping for an intellectual exploration of what a ""World Without America"" would look like.  Instead I got a clearly politically motivated accounting of sources of ""American Shame"", why that shame is unfounded, and who is responsible for perpetuating and taking advantage of that shame for disastrous political goals.

There were some allusions to the fact that democracy and freedom as it is today would not exist or at least not be the same without America, but other than the opening scene (which contributes to the farce) there is no discussion of when America might have been prevented from forming or ceasing to exist.  No analysis of who would have filled the void, Mexico, Britain, French Canadians.  No imagining a different outcome for or whether or not certain wars would even have happened.  No changing space or nuclear race, or anything else intellectual interesting as a ""what if"".

Bottom line, if you are looking for a right wing political documentary that goes from presenting a some interesting insights at one moment to representing the peak of conspiracy theory paranoia the next than have at it.  If, on the other hand, you were hoping for intellectual insight into a world where America didn't exist and a series of discussions exploring ""What If's"" then your time is better spent elsewhere.",1443657600,5,1318,4.9908675799086755

A critique of American exceptionalism does not mean you are unpatriotic, rather I would say that to create propaganda such as this film, which vilifies those who may actually desire to redeem the best characteristics of America, is unpatriotic at best, dangerously destructive at its worst.

Save yourself some time, engage with those you disagree with, wrestle through the complexities without surrendering to false ideologies such as what is found in this backwards emotional liturgy.",1442534400,5,526,5.481481481481482

This is one every American ought to watch.,1441152000,,314,4.943396226415095
6483788,5,B00LG7VWIA,"This movie was emotionally moving and definitely worth viewing.  Intellectually, it represents a legitimate and fairly well-reasoned response to the those who have, in their political discourse (mostly the left), painted America's path through history as oppressive, capitalism as immoral, and bigger government and central control as the solution to global ills over individual autonomy.  The movie takes down with force those who claim America has been an oppressive nation that has ""stolen"" from the rest of the world.  The movie argues that Individual autonomy, combined with an entrepreneur spirit, are roots of America's greatness and that America has spread these values elsewhere, for the good of world.  D'Souza takes on those on the far-left (the President included) who make it a practice of falsely shaming America's past (and present) for divisive, political purposes. The movie makes the case that a world without America would be the world that was before America: a world in which central, controlling forces used tyranny and raw power to conquer, divide, and enrich the controlling class. To quote from the movie, classic American virtues include ""individual initiative, community, faith, to help herself and others. Is the wealth of America based on theft? Actually, no. The wealth of America isn't stolen, it's created. The ethic of conquest is universal. What's uniquely American is the alternative: equal rights, self-determination, and wealth creation [which occurs through capitalism, America's enterprise-centered spirit and free markets].  If America did not exist, the conquest ethic would dominate the world once again. America isn't the problem. America is the answer.""  Indeed, with the rise of the powers that precipitated World War II, the conquest ethnic of world history nearly did once again dominate, but it was America who stepped up -- at great cost to its own -- to crush it.",1441065600,,1913,5.381270903010034

But the movie unfortunately takes a huge political stance on the right that makes liberals seem demonized.  I cannot agree with the vast majority of political statements and attacks on the current Commander in Chief that are rampant throughout the movie.  A smart movie but with a terrible message about the evils of liberals.  I watched almost the entire movie until I couldn't stomach the last twenty minutes or so.  People are free to disagree with me, but for a movie trying to talk about a great nation that even quotes Bono saying it isn't a right or left issue, it leans way too far right for it to somehow unify Americans.  By the way...  I couldn't even figure out ANY time in the duration of this film where the movie justified the title ""America: Imagine the World Without Her"".

Excellent film, very educational and entertaining (not always possible).  Enjoyed his interviews with both sides of the political aisle.

It makes me ill the  way this documentarian twists Aaron Swartz's position toward being partisan, and I'm surprised that Noam Chomsky  even agreed to an interview. The documentary started off alright. Nevertheless, of course Zinn's book is one sided, he was offering a different perspective that all countries, including our own likes to sweep under the rug. It's not suicidal for a country's citizens to acknowledge their past, it's an essential part of improvement and making peace. You know who can't see their own faults or weaknesses? Fascists. It boggles the mind how inconsistent this guy is. But I'm not surprised at all that he went to jail for campaign financing issues, he would be the type to think corruption is ok if it serves his interests, which aren't ""American"". They aren't my interests and I fought for this country. As for Obama, well I've  got a few bones to pick with him too, and you should too, but do it by becoming informed. Don't watch this crap thinking you know what's up and start spamming Facebook with Alex Jones garbage, read books.",1438300800,,1354,4.982300884955753

6483863,5,B00LG7VWIA,"This should be required watching by any parent who cares what their children are learning. Today the Public Schools are all run by Liberal Socialists who down grade America and her roll in the world. We have a President who demeans this country at every opportunity ...

This DVD shows how truly great AMERICA really is. It show how much America has contributed to mankind and the cause of Freedom all over the world. In the history of the world, there has never been a country like America. There has never been a country who not only fought for its freedom against the worlds reigning Super Power, and WON. But, it has fought many times and lost thousands of American Lives in the battles against Tyrants to give other countries the freedom so many today take for granted.

This movie will enlighten those of you who've never served in the Military, or fought on foreign soil. We have seen the reason America goes to war, up close and personal. America is unique in the history of Mankind. Dinesh D'Souza shows us the reason why America is so great.

This DVD will show your children what is being kept from them in our Socialist Run School System today.

Liberals want America to join a One World Government.... WHY ? This DVD will show you that the World should JOIN US, not us joining them.

The ""World"" has nothing to offer America.... This movie shows our former greatness. It shows that as a nation we are built on the Power of the People...that has somehow been lost and we need to get it back. The enemies of America no longer fear us, our allies no longer trust us.

This DVD shows that America's greatness is not in its government, but in its people. We have allowed a corrupted government to divide us as a Nation, and to reject Nationalism. Our government is supposed to represent us. The world thinks our Government is the American People. Our Government has become an embarrassment, and no longer represents the Will and Morals of America.

If you love America...after watching this DVD, you'll love it even more.",1438300800,,2029,4.60387811634349

Then the movie takes a turn and starts researching whether many of the criticisms are true and/or relevant for today.  Very well done and balanced approach with credibility.  America is a force for good in the world and is exceptional in giving citizens freedom unparalleled in the world.  Many of the criticisms of America have to be taken in proper perspective.  I was very impressed and the movie definitely keeps your attention and gives you a lot of food for thought and further research.  Overall I would HIGHLY recommend to all and especially high school and college students who seem to be fed a steady diet of America is evil without being given the other side of the story.

A lot of time was spent refuting revisionist historians, which has its place, however, it did nothing to show the audience what the world would truly be like had America never been born. Parts of more recent American history were completely left out,  things that may have painted the US in a less favorable light.

They, not being history buffs like me, have all been amazed, just to see the T R U T H so plainly laid out with documentation and historical fact, totally defying what the universities have been proffering to our young. the 'liberally hijacked ' colleges have been turning out ill facts that are twisted with America hating bias and then infiltrating the media from there with their many 'grads', but  the other half of America is rising up to challenge the lies about our dear country. the slander the garbage taught is totally manipulated to deceive by the highly 'religious liberal secular humanist America despising left'...that has been shoving their personal religious beliefs down everyone's throats for a long time now, via  the ed systems they took over in the 1960's .  silence/deception no more:) Dinesh is my hero at this point; what a brave man already attacked for his work by the controlling folk that are very very scared of his work:)",1435622400,3,1027,4.790960451977401

If you're at all interested in American history, this movie will entertain you, and it will give you food for thought. This movie reveals many facts, and draws opinions and conclusions solidly derived from those facts, that I have never heard before. Not only is the content very well done, so is the production.

If you are a moderate or an unaffiliated intellectual you will realize that this guy has a right agenda. He is beautiful in approaching his topic by seemingly giving voice to the ""other side"" but if you look beyond, he gives little to no voice to others that advocate a left position. Slaves a problem? Not any more b/c a few Blacks owned some slaves (look up the numbers). Taking land from the Native-Americans? Which tribe really owned that land that was taken? Huge erroneous leaps to unjustified conclusions throughout. Again, if you are a conservative, you will love this movie. If you are a liberal, you will hate it. If you are somewhere in the middle you will find yourself laughing at the leaps made to provide unjustified conclusions.

6484074,1,B00LG7VWIA,"Well, first of all, the movie is misleading.  I was expecting a theoretical type film, like what if Germany won WWII, but it's not like that at all.  It's a defense against alleged American crimes (theft, genocide, slavery, etc).

It's not very well done as a movie or a documentary.  The whole thing is anecdotal and he taps the fringe rather than the mainstream.  It comes across as a person who is irrational and cannot admit fault.  It's what evil people do: try to use a logical justification for bad acts.  There's nothing wrong with admitting you did something wrong.  We followed a policy that resulted in near genocidal outcomes with native americans. But that was over a hundred years ago.  We've evolved ethically and morally and you can't hold people to crimes that someone else did long ago.  That would be a logical defense.  But this film makes arguments like, well, they did it to themselves, are you really saying we're as bad as Nazis...

I watched thinking maybe I'd get something to think about.  But if you exercise any kind of critical thinking, the arguments just don't hold water.  It comes across more like a person who has an axe to grind.",1431129600,8,1165,4.647058823529412

If they don't like America why don't they move to one of the socialist countries. They should try it before they buy it. I for one don't care for it. Although free enterprises isn't exactly free.

It is odd that in order to explain American Exceptionalism, Dinesh D'Souza proclaims that everyone, was enslaving and pillaging. If everyone is doing it, by definition, it is not exceptional!
Now, about the film. Based upon the title and the opening scene of George Washington being killed, I was expecting a film showing what the world would be like without the U.S.A; like the movies ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and A Day Without a Mexican.  Instead, the film morphed into a defense of the indictments against America. It received only an 8% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is too harsh.

6484112,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Dinesh D'Souza does a nice job allowing opposition to present their charges against America in the voice and words of the accusers themselves, allowing them to present their position without hindrance or editing.

Dinesh then offers counter point - this is called balance. (Actually a fair amount of History, social perspective, and commentary is included).  This is the part that the young in the title should be exposed to, for they will have never been taught any of this in school.

Those who oppose this movie have stated that it is one sided, but:
The reason it appears to be one sided - is the charges from the left are so weak, and with so little foundation, they have no merit.
But, you may not be able to see that, since you are closed minded.

As a final note - any parent of young children should watch, and become aware of some of our history, so when you see your children not being taught, it might be time for you to educate yourself, then educate your children.  We know the schools will not do it.",1430092800,,1015,4.464864864864865

6484172,2,B00LG7VWIA,"If you're desperately searching for a documentary that defends America from a bias view, then look no further. In this feature you'll unlock, not so much the facts about the U.S., but how Director Dinesh D'Souza sees them. Frankly, he manipulates the viewer into seeing it his way as well. However, there is a degree of merit in the documentary, and had D'Souza been more careful, he may have been more successful in explaining his views. Unfortunately, his narrative of America ends up being just as polarizing as those he attempts to discredit; historian Howard Zinn, President Obama, and Hilary Clinton (to name a few) are the sources of today's problems in America, according to D'Souza

  With that said, I did find a somewhat (if not) simplified then ""refreshing"" perspective on accusations against America's ""imperial"" history. Accusations such as theft of lands, (lands acquired after the Mexican American War for example), genocide, (treatment of Native Americans), and imperial conquest, (wars fought outside U.S. borders), are discussed. The critical stance of America's history spearheaded by the likes of Howard Zinn and such represent what D'Souza calls ""the shaming of America"". Essentially, its those views by Zinn and radical Saul Alinsky that are responsible for slowly dismantling our country. It's apparent where D'Souza's political views are by the time he links current democrats for being schooled by Alinsky, long before they entered office......And this where the documentary starts to lose credibility.

  Dinesh D'Souza has his own agenda. The only difference between him and those he accuses for destroying America is that he's just on the other side of the political rallying. If anything, his views are just as absolute, controversial, and questionable as those he attempts to discredit. His answer, is to portray a country that is victimized and misunderstood. Some of the montage sequences borderline propaganda, solely to sway people to embrace his romanticized notions of our history and dispose of a very American virtue: Accountability.

  In 2012 D'Souza plead guilty to making illegal political contributions. He was sentenced to eight months in community confinement and fined $30,000. He was formerly the president of King's College, a Christian liberal arts institution and resigned after the campaign contribution scandal. Although, the events of 2012 were mentioned in his own film, the incident is summed up with a very convenient, ""mistakes happen"" sentiment. Again, where is the accountability?

  D'Souza's intention may be genuine. Most people would agree that America is due for some restoration. We crave the vision of being a country that stands for good. We need the leadership and people to get us there. ""America: Imagine the World Without Her"" at best marginally explains matters. If its blatant agenda isn't enough to leave anyone asking questions, then its rose colored simplified explanations of our actions are. The answers to this country's crisis will come from embracing all points of view. That's the mark this documentary misses. D'Souza isn't enlightening anyone in a way that will be to everyone's best interest. This film's perspective is unbalanced. I'd like to see a documentary that focuses on how the American public filters information for the sake of reinforcing their own beliefs.",1429056000,2,3354,5.343453510436433

Ironically, movies like this are a real danger to America.

Instead of informing and analyzing, it just panders to its target audience, with an appeal to emotion and a reassurance that they are right and there's no need to think too hard or examine their positions or consider any other viewpoints.

Democracy works by compromise and mutual understanding, not by vilifying everyone who is not like you. America is strong when informed, thinking people work together to pragmatically solve problems despite their different world-views.

But, speaking objectively, this documentary was kind of lame. Perhaps it's because the liberal ideology is so massively evil, corrupt and perverted, but I just feel that this kind of sedate, defensive, kosher-conservative pablum doesn't offer the  proportionate and appropriate response. D'Souza argues that America is actually a pretty nice place that offers opportunity to everyone. Words that can be used to describe this film are banal, anodyne, insipid, , conventional, impotent. I give it two stars for the very good historical reenactments and the conservative talking points that might not be well-known by uninformed viewers.",1427241600,2,935,5.448275862068965

The film is eye opening but their are several parts where foul language is used and I'm very disappointed but not totally shocked because liberals or non believers can't produce anything else without a moral compass directed by a conscience trained by the Holy Spirit.

That being said, I found this documentary to be very good and totally confirms what the bible says about not only our culture at hand but the hearts of the people that are not born again and what the consequence of that end will be.",1425859200,,618,4.660550458715596

America has done wrong, that's history, and cannot be denied. America is better than what it used to be for Christopher Columbus invasion and colonialism, but it still has it's ills that need to be corrected. That's the difference between a liberal and conservative, liberals face the truth, while conservatives deny. Don't waste your time with these lies from Dinesh D'Souza.

6484326,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Dinesh D'Souza's documentary piece about American history & culture, & how current or contemporary political views analyze that stated subject is one of the best and most enjoyable I have seen on film.  There were many historical facts and notions even I did not know before seeing this film about my own country, (& one can state I am biased) the country I personally love more then life itself.

 One critic noted that D'Souza does not answer the main question of the film's title, ""Image a world without her."" What he does instead is talk about is the the recent far left driven historical revisionism, & in my opinion, the hate filled & twisted ideologies that paint America in a negative fashion (for reasons of dislike of free market capitalism, white guilt, dislike of Western culture, a hatred for the military or police, an economic & philosophical support for Marxism, anger toward the Vietnam conflict, a desire for pacifism at all costs, or some other ""out there"" theory).

 D'Souza is an immigrant from India, a country with very strict social and economic policies.  India is a country that has a time honored long tradition of a caste system, people are born either super poor or super wealthy and they remain that way for life.  The free market system is fairly new to India's ancient culture, and people who are not wealthy usually do not have a method to get themselves out of poverty regardless of how hard they may work.  Thus a young college student Dinesh D'Souza comes to the United States, works hard to become a US citizen, and attends college only to find himself emerged in a ""whacko land"" environment that declares a hatred for free market capitalism with a strong hatred for America herself, the system & nation that has allowed Dinesh and many others to improve their personal life and income drastically.

 Dinesh decided to conduct extensive years long research on who these people that wanted America & her capitalist system eliminated were, since most of them were American citizens, and what is this chip on their shoulder?  What is this ideology that these people swear by, and where did it come from?  What is this ideology based upon, and why is it so popular among very wealthy actors in Hollywood?  Who are the champions and intelligencia core of this movement, and what is their ultimate agenda for the people who live in America today?

At the start of the film Dinesh goes into Washington, and the Revolutionary War very briefly, then fast forwards to French intellectual Alexis De Tocqueville who traveled to the young American nation to make critical observations for his research.

 De Tocqueville made some astonishing observations about the uniqueness of the American people and their young nation, and he had actually also noticed years prior that the economic and social institutions between the North and South were not compatible.  De Tocqueville had wisely realized that the ""evil"" and unjust institution of slavery had not been economically viable if the American nation were to continue onward, and flourish.  He was a man who saw the bigger picture long before others could.

De Tocqueville had also noticed the bold pioneering and economic spirit that was unique to America, and how an ordinary person if he worked hard enough could achieve much more then a man born into a similar economic status back in Europe or other places around the world really could not achieve.

 Then Dinesh interviews, and dissects the current spokesmen for the ""secular far left"" or ""progressive left"" movement in modern American society, including their biggest intellectual champion Mr. Ward Churchill of Colorado.  Unlike other leftists, Mr. Churchill acts more in my opinion as a third way- lone wolf, ""Boba Fett"" like actor upon the current American scene where he not only hates America he also seems to hate America's adversaries too along with most other differing foreign nations as well equally.  Dinesh talks with Churchill on why he holds a distain for America's military, and why he also hates the current free market system.  Why is Mr. Ward Churchill an important person for Dinesh to interview?  Why do we as an audience care what Churchill believes?  Because Ward Churchill holds notions and espouses ideals that are almost identical to many top Professors in most of America's colleges, and this agenda is pushed upon young students as a standard ideology.

 Dinesh discusses the 1960's origins of the ""far left"" political and ideological movement and how they formed because of the horrible conflict in Vietnam.  Dinesh also reviews the history of a man who many Hollywood elite actors, and other college professors similar to Ward Churchill swear by, a late Marxist - new aged Communist named Howard Zinn.  Zinn had written a number of historical books defining American society in an ugly negative narrative.  He starts off with Christopher Colombus, and claims Colombus's sins against the Native American people are also USA's sins, even though Colombus was an Italian sailor working for the Spanish, and that the U.S.'s history really starts with the Pilgrims from England landing in Massachusetts, these tit bit facts are not separated in Zinn's original narrative.  Zinn's ideology and claim is that America's idealism was designed for a form of socialism that may have mirrored the ideals of Karl Marx, and not what it turned into after the American Revolution where the economic system of Capitalism had been practiced and embraced as the American system.

How or why anyone would ever link the notions of socialism to America's founding is beyond my comprehension, because anyone who studied real history knows economic freedom was one of many reasons the Colonists had rebelled against Britain's reign.  Some how Zinn in his sick & twisted form of logic had linked ideals similar to that of Karl Marx (or forced egalitarian socialism) to the country's founding, when nothing could be further from the truth.  Zinn was basically a foul & deranged fraud who had built a foundation that the modern far left swear by, but only holds true in the arena of pure fantasy.

 Zinn's former partner is interviewed by Dinesh.  This gentleman exposes who the real author (Zinn) himself was, and how he the partner many years later in the modern world as an older and much wiser man realized the error of his own ways seeing the fraud that Marxism is and the failure of Socialist regimes around the world time onward.

 Dinesh also discusses the history of the American Southwest, land obtained first after the conflict between the people of Texas rebelling against the Mexican Empire, then later a war with Mexico herself where mostly all of Mexico had been conquered in the end.  The US, unlike every other nation or empire after military victory in the history of the world, gave most of Mexico back to the Mexican people but they did obtain the land from New Mexico to Arizona, and ultimately California.  Current American citizens who are of Mexican descent, are interviewed by Dinesh on their views between Mexican culture and American culture and laws.  A gentlemen from Texas interviewed who immigrated lawfully from Mexico as a youth states clearly why he prefers being a Texan, and an American because he believes he has more personal freedom along with economic incentives verses being a citizen of Mexico where his rights would be limited and the profits his business makes would be mostly collected by either government or a drug cartel.

 The main and primary argument made by Dinesh is one I believe every American student and soldier alike should learn and understand, through out the history of this Earth countries and kingdoms had fought in bloody battles due to an ideology called the ""Conquest Ethic"", where the strongest toughest thug should attack and steal from everyone else because this view was looked at in history as being ""cool"" or ""manly"".  Every nation, even Great Britain who held the largest most powerful Empire in Earth's history beyond Rome adhered to this ""Conquest Ethic"", even if they were a bit more civilized about it then other big nations had been.

 But the United States DID NOT adhere to this ""evil"" and arguably ""problem causing"" ideology, and she still does not adhere to this ideal because America's notion in warfare has generally never been about conquest or revenge, it has been about defense and reforming or changing the government after victory has been obtained upon that defeated nation in order to build new alliances and trade partners.  America and her ideal is not about building nor expanding a massive empire for the shear enjoyment on oppressing conquered peoples, it is about growing private capitalist driven businesses and maintaining her constitutional republic, which honestly has really never been practiced before in the dark cruel history of mankind.  Even Rome's republic had fallen.

  Dinesh delightfully displays why he believes in and loves America and does so with strong historical facts which in some moments of the film he has actors re-enact in different scenes.  This film was so patriotically enjoyable that when I first entered the theater I had watched this movie in Walt Disney World Florida, the date had been July 3rd.  When the movie ended, and I had been walking out of the theater and I decided to check my watch, where the date had read, ""The 4th of July""...  A fitting personal end to a wonderful documentary movie about the greatest country on Earth.  Five stars and two thumbs up.

On this reviewer's opinion & personal belief, the support and love for America is not a form of blind jingoism, nor is it misplaced nationalism.  There are rational, historically documented, and sound reasons why the U.S. is a wonderful and great country worth living in, working in, fighting for when we have to, and absolutely worth dying for. A world without America is indeed an even more horrible and ugly one, for America despite her flaws is the light of hope, glory, and goodness in this world.",1424649600,3,10033,4.948121645796064

6484330,3,B00LG7VWIA,"A clever piece.  D'Souza makes good points.  The world would be worse without the USA.  He is correct when he talks of the tens of thousands of Irish who were captured and sent mainly to the West Indies but also to North and South America as temporary involuntary servants --- virtual slaves.  His point is that Africans were not the only sufferers.  Of course, he did not mention that Irish are better looking than Africans and therefore they get better treatment in life, other things being equal.  Also, he makes the political far-left look bad when he rhetorically outwits a spokesman into saying that since it would have been worthwhile to nuke a German city to shorten WW2, it would be worthwhile to nuke a city in the right-wing-controlled USA.  The slow-thinker should have replied, ""What would that accomplish?  Nothing like a WW2 nuke.""  Furthermore, he makes Hispanics look bad when he interviews a professor who wants Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, etc. returned to Mexico.  That sounds a bit scary, but the reality is that most Hispanics simply want to be accepted and treated just as well as anyone else --- and not as a people who are low on someone's food chain.  Also, there is a colonial revolutionary soldier who writes home on Sept. 11, 1777 that in the last battle ""we stood firm and pushed the enemy back.""  Actually, on Sept. 11, 1777, the British routed the colonial force under Washington.  What gives?  The author could have selected a battle that the colonials won.  Furthermore, contrary to the narrator, the colonials did not fight ""most powerful army in the world"" in 1775-1781, in my opinion.  That would have been the Prussian army.",1424649600,5,1673,4.817543859649123

6484346,2,B00LG7VWIA,"Take it for what it is, the film is a great tool to teach modern propaganda.  You just have to ignore the attempt by D'Souza to place himself on the victim pedestal.  He is trying to shift his own error, mistake, crime...(whatever you want to call it) to President Obama picking on him because he spoke up.  So again two real purposes: 1. useful for teaching modern propaganda, 2. film to discuss the poor attempt at making oneself a victim of big bad Uncle Sam.",1424476800,3,462,4.411764705882353

D'Souza has a wonderful way of unfolding concept after concept and then unraveling the myth and bringing forward the truth.  I read What's So Great About Christianity by D'Souza and saw his other movie Obama'a America: 2016, and loved them both.  This new movie is of the same caliber.

6484419,1,B00LG7VWIA,"I'm really trying to understand the logic of the author/creator.  D'Souza was raised in India and he states that he really didn't like the caste system - which imposes the interests of some above others - but loves democracy in the U.S.  However, after he moves here, now in a freer culture, he imposes his own interests above others by breaking our law and committing a felony.  And the infraction that he pleads guilty to is a campaign finance law, which exists to help keep our country more democratic.  So, he has taken an illegal action that is destructive to the same democracy - that he loves??  Similarly, the movie seemed like a lot of largely incoherent propaganda with a strange political objective (I'm conservative).",1422921600,10,729,4.8

6484450,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Much food for thought here. Every American should view this movie. Perhaps it will stimulate some thinking about where this country is headed.

6484451,1,B00LG7VWIA,"I would suggest researching D'Souza's predictions regarding the fall of the US under the current administration and how far off the mark he was to get a feel for how poorly researched and written this movie is.

It is a perfect fantasy, if you are in to alternative history.  But if you are looking for factual information, you may want to look somewhere else.  I would suggest an actual historian for starters, not a religious fundamentalist.",1422230400,9,443,4.802631578947368

The film was so disturbing in a ""wake up and realize what's happening to our country"" sort of way. It was a much needed wake up call for me. My teenagers watched it with me and, no surprise, it was contrary to everything they're learning in common core history classes.",1421625600,2,354,4.220588235294118

In our American world, where terms like ""Big Oil"", ""Big Business"", and ""Wall Street"" are portrayed as major evils in our modern day society, this film shows you the diversion that is and has taken place in our American society.

  It took an immigrant with an understanding of world history to counter the Zinn believers, and show that we should be proud of the role America has played in the past 240 years.

I think many of us are intellectually aware that there are people out there who are revisionists and really do not want America to exist in the form we have all grown up with and love.  They are attacking her through media and our young people in a hundred different ways.  As I stated... I was intellectually aware of all the things brought up in this documentary film but had never had all of them brought home so clearly and all at once.  To be frank, it was shocking!

I enjoyed the in-depth look at influences around president Obama in childhood and before he took office. Liked the inclusion and explanation of Alinski.

6484510,5,B00LG7VWIA,"There is much history I know, especially American history, But this movie taught me many things I never knew. And I am sure it only scratched the surface. To learn about the daughter of a slave in the 1860's, female entrepreneur Sarah Breedlove, who sold beauty products and became rich was incredible ! I was never taught in school that there were black slave owners owned black slaves. And to gain insight into the tactics of Saul Alinksy and to see how they are used today by the left-wing Democrats was very informative and frightening. And also very sad to see such arrogance and ignorance come together to take away our freedom. Thank you for your efforts, Dinesh.",1421107200,2,670,4.686440677966102

If your like the tiny number of reviewers here that are leaving reviews without even watching the film, then you're closed mind is perpetuating your ignorance, and enabling the power mongers in DC to steal our Liberty.

""Red,White,and Black"" by Dr. Gary Nash gives a much more holistic approach to the development and growth of racism in North America compared with attitudes on race in Central and South America where Chattel Slavery did not exist as it did in English North America and the United States. It is not completely biased in that many of the great things our country has accomplished are often overshadowed by our shady past and the director does highlight those events and people praising them for accomplishments often ignored.

6484670,5,B00LG7VWIA,"In the day, and age we live, the educational system has been trying to degrade the truth of how the United States of America has helped many around the world.  It has only been in recent times that the greed of money, or power, of those who sit in positions of great influence are making choices that are adversely effecting many others.  Not only adversely effecting those outside the United States of America but for the citizens as well.  It isn't that Americans agree with what is going on!  We as citizens know what some of those in power are doing, and are speaking out against it.

What is needed is a REAL EDUCATION in what is truly happening, and naming those who are making the choices that are devastating others.
This movie is a great start!  We need more movies like this as movies are a good venue.  Not HYPE movies such as those that have been made by Michael Moore.  Even though Michael Moore's movies have truth to them they are politically motivated which, at least for me causes a distrust from the start. Truth speaks for its self, and if embellishment seems necessary then I would suggest more prepairations should be made prior to filming.

We also need instruction on how to effectively proceed after the  information has been presented, and verified.

I want to know the truth plain, and simple.  I can make my own choices from there.  Then, I will be responsible as will be all others who will then be more intelligently informed.",1419897600,,1455,4.571428571428571

D'Souza interviews many of those  with whom he disagrees and has debated in public, in a very non-threatening, non-confrontational way, and presents their opposing views, so this film is NOT just a right-wing lecture. The film explores how American institutions have been transformed over the decades through the teaching of provably unreliable revisionist history to indoctrinate the American People to potentially destroy America's founding principles, ostensibly  to make American society ""fair.""  The film shows quite logically how such a transformation would actually be the complete opposite of fair.  I found this to be a VERY well-thought-out and thought-provoking film!

He ties together the idea that secularism and the left go hand in hand, and that basically - you can't have morality without religion.

In addition, while the people he interviews from the far left certainly represent some awful views, he doesn't offer too much in ways of arguments explaining the basis for their ideas nor his own. What we get instead are some nice vignettes, covering the surface of what makes these people tick...but not often hitting to the core.

I'm happy this film and book exist but if we're going to beat down the people that would see America destroyed from the inside out, we will have to do a better job than justifying it all on ""God said so"" to win. Individualism, capitalism...and achievement minded culture must stand on provable premises using ones reason to understand them - not faith.

6484759,4,B00LG7VWIA,"Lots of good information, but I was bothered by the ending where Mr. D'Souza interjected his own story and too much justification for his actions and blame on the administration. I am not a fan of Pres. Obama's apparent war on conservatives, particularly using the media and IRS as the administration has done. I think that is despicable. However, I think Mr. D'Souza could have focused on the stories of other people caught in the IRS trap rather than his own, and made the same points in a less self-serving way. The historical context given to the various criticisms of America was helpful and informative, but a little heavy handed as well. The title seemed out of sync with the message of the movie - it's not so much about the world without America as the one sided-ness of the media, and attacks on America by her enemies. Worth seeing and contemplating. I wish Mr. D'Souza had trusted the audience to draw their own conclusions though.

6484766,2,B00LG7VWIA,"I had no expectations going in, and found the production values to be better than expected.  The main flaw was the studied amnesia when it came to blame.  For example, the spying apparatus is treated as an invention of Obama when I was put in during the Bush administration.  Further, his defense of Capitalism is built on a wildly over simplistic image of candle-making entrepreneurs instead of the modern specter of CRONY capitalism and the Wall St. bailouts.  Finally, he slams the Affordable Health Care law claiming people didn't want to buy insurance, leaving out the problem of people not being able to buy insurance due to pre-existing conditions.  The final result is a sentimental quilt of reassuring half-truths ending in a bizarre tangent on Saul Alinsky, Obama, and Hillary.

6484807,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Near the beginning of ""America:  Imagine the World Without Her,"" filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza asserts that this country is one that ""allows you to write the script of your own life.""  Billions around the world think so much of this country that they would love to live here, but there are hard-Left activists who think that America is not only not great but is evil.  In this film, D'Souza examines what the world might be like if the U.S. did not exist.

Obviously only a tiny number of those who vote Democratic or call themselves liberals actually think that the U.S. is evil, but D'Souza interviews some of those few on the far Left who spout five especially pernicious myths in a vile attempt to inject shame and guilt into the middle class in order to gain power and control over them.

In an interview concerning his movie, D'Souza sagely stated that what he resents most of all about the far Left is that it exploits the decency of average Americans, many of whom are simply not equipped to fight and win psychological wars launched against them by ""victims.""  However, D'Souza provides the historical knowledge and arguments to refute the five myths, demonstrating along the way the far Left's moral relativism and lack of respect for truth above all.

Late in the film, D'Souza shows how some of the liberties Americans have taken for granted for generations have become imperiled.

When watching the film, one wonders which country the hard-Left activists think is the greatest if not the United States.  Some in Canada and Western Europe sometimes deliver prissy sermonettes about our lack of a system in which everyone gets ""free"" health care, but the only reason--the ONLY reason--those countries were able to implement their gargantuan welfare states after World War II is that they were under the protection of the American military and nuclear umbrella.  Had the U.S. sunk into the ocean on January 1, 1946, and had the rest of the West been on its own against the Soviet Union, obviously the cradle-to-grave welfare states of Canada and Western Europe would never have seen the light of day.

I enjoyed this movie much more than the previous effort of D'Souza, ""2016,"" which relied primarily on ad hominem circumstantial and thus was frankly not up to the standards of his awesome intellect.  ""America"" defends our country against five of the most heinous charges against it and would make great viewing especially for younger Americans.",1418947200,5,2451,4.893719806763285

6484847,1,B00LG7VWIA,"Casting red meat to his low IQ audience and chanting jingoistic phrases throughout.  Convicted felon Dinesh DSouza, manages to present Wing-nut kitsch of the first order, Dinesh DSouzas follow-up to 2016: Obamas America opens with a Continental Army soldier writing a letter on September 11, 1777 (My loving wife, these past few months away from you and Nathaniel have been difficult) and ends with freed slaves dancing while Phillip Phillips Home blares on the soundtrack. In between these two high-water marks of tasteless cheese sits a specious, conspiracy-kook paean to Dinesh DSouza. At times hilariously insincere, DSouzas feature-length tribute to his humility and love for colonialism, exceptionalism, and the American dream plays like the defenses side of a sentencing hearing, climaxing in a scene where the director poses for the camera in handcuffs and then gets up to stare at the Lincoln Memorial. Three months after the movies release, DSouza was sentenced to a halfway house for campaign fraud. [Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]
He at least manages at least to come in at #15 for 2104's twenty worst movies of the year.  This movie is required watching for anyone with IQ's under 80 and/or is a Fox News Viewer.",1418601600,17,1216,5.16751269035533

6484862,5,B00LG7VWIA,"This documentary is a lot better than his '2016: Obama documetary', which I found quite boring.

This documentary should be seen not only by Americans, but also by Europeans. It's sad to see so many people in the West hating Western civilization. America has changed the world for the better.

If you're a leftist or a liberal, you should especially watch this documentary. You may have not heard many of the arguments presented in this documentary, since colleges and the media are dominated by the Left almost completely. In this documentary, you will learn that:

1. Slavery wasn't unique to America - it was acceptable in the past and it even continues to this day in some African countries.

2. There was never a genocide against the Indians - most died because of disease that came along with the Europeans.

3. Mexicans are quite happy to leave their corrupt and dangerous homeland in order to come to America.

4. Capitalism has made America the most prosperous country in the world.

5. The founders were religious Christians and they founded a Christian country.",1418515200,,1072,4.857142857142857
6484863,4,B00LG7VWIA,"I am not basing my rating on my politics preferences, but the on intellect.. I have watched the 2?-hour DVD.

""America"" points out some things in the USA that are often skipped over or forgotten. Some people do not realize that this is not an official history documentation. Its a top seller in politics, not history. It observes parts of history of American history, people's options, and their stance.

History: I wonder how many parts of the show referring to history are actually remembered.  I didn't remember most of it off the top of my head, but learned in in the past. I can't guarantee is fully accurate, but it is taught in schools (excluding the last part of politics). It was more like a partial mind-refresher. Also, history contains options and beliefs. (Note all the arguments about what is accurate in history itself in public.). At least the show provides reasonable supports.

Politics or POVs: ""America"" is someone saying ""this is what I think"" with sensibility. I do not think that it is on an extremist level. Am I saying that this is fully neutral show? No. However, people need to see from both sides. People do not have to agree, but it does not hurt. ""America"" at least mentions point-of-views from more than one side, rather than leaving them out. If anything, now you have a better idea of what some people think.",1418428800,2,1341,4.693617021276595

Unfortunately they are just a bunch of loudmouth cowards that can't even see the irony of being in a country where they can slander and distort the truth about that very country, and not be imprisoned for it, due to the freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution that they seek to destroy.  We don't need a Constitutional amendment to protect our Flag, just a simple piece of legislation that grants amnesty to those that come to the defense of our flag under assault.",1418428800,,789,4.661870503597123

6484886,1,B00LG7VWIA,"This movie was a great example of the kind of partisan extremist propaganda that is destroying our government.  People need to wise up and realize that when they vote for people associated to any political party the people they elect will represent the political parties agenda instead of the will of the constituency they are supposed to represent.  People need to do their own research into history and politics and learn how to form their own thoughts and opinions instead of believing whatever they hear in the media.

Also, I didn't find convincing the arguments against the accusations that America exploited Native Americans, Mexicans, African Americans, and regular working class people, and that it created more chaos in the world after WWII instead of maintaining more harmony and peace.

The author addresses these issues head on in a very positive manner by listening respectfully to those who hold these views and then responding with facts.

6485039,1,B00LG7VWIA,"The title is very misleading. The film actually has very little to do with real historical facts and is overwhelmingly geared as a political statement by conservative republicans towards their opposition. The film references few historical events in a very flimsy argument that doesn't actually exist, ""The Shaming of America"". There is actually no doubt that America has taken part in the atrocities that they are sometimes accused of, however there is equally no doubt that America has taken part in some of the greatest events in the history of the world. The title of the film and the description on the box deceptively lures one to believe the film might be a hypothetical look at the world should America have never become a nation. As a history teacher, I was very disappointed in this film, as the argument trying to be made was really a 'mask' covering an agenda. The fabrication of real historical events was disheartening. The extremists examples used to make their points have very little to do with the 'argument' they were trying to make. All together, it is not worth your money or your time unless you want to witness some right wing agenda in action.",1417564800,26,1167,4.810945273631841

In this film he reviews and exposes the historical lies, spin and factual omissions that are utilized in the liberal effort to denigrate America.

Then, one by one, he exposes them as the half-truths and outright lies that they are by putting them in historical context and debunking them by revealing the largely omitted or downplayed facts supporting America that are relative to each of these falsehoods.

Perception can be colored, shaped and falsified. Truth is evident and discoverable with the aid of reason.

6485182,5,B00LG7VWIA,"I unintentionally came across this dvd being featured at a redbox machine location in the  Washington D.C. neighborhood of American University (Tenleytown-AU metro transit stop). This documentary is not normally something I frequently watch, but my open mind compelled me to check it out for some reason.  The beginning of the dvd documentary made me cringe and I almost did not want to continue watching it because I did enthusiastically vote for President Obama back in 2012 and would like to believe that deep down his intentions are frequently good/well intentioned for the American people even if his name is connected with some controversial/highly politically charged issues. In Dinesha Dsouzas defense, he did include a wealth of information in America: Imagine A World Without Her. The following are some of the features/details in the dvd:  Lionsgate Presents movie trailers for The Expendables 3, Draft Day, Almost Wanted Man, movie about President Obama by Dinesh Dsouza, and promotional for Epix (epixdotcom). Then the content of this daring yet detail packed documentary: brief Colonial re-enactment of an alternate reality of what could have happened if George Washington would have been killed or if the Civil War would have split the U.S.  Dinesh Dsouza also conducts interviews with some of the following people: CharmaineWhiteface, a Native America Activist and a cultural member of the Great Sioux Nation, the tribes ancestral lands includes Mount Rushmore, a very controversial interview with Charles Trujillo. Charles Trujillo is a Professor of Chicano Studies at the University of New Mexico and a strong believer in Chicano Nationalism. Trujillo admitted that he doesnt feel the need to move back to Mexico because he feels that he is already in Mexico (the area that he lives in within the United States) and that he is in America but not of America.  Trujillo also admitted to telling his Chicano students of how he feels when there isn't a United States. He is part of a movement affiliated with reclaiming lands in the U.S. that use to be a part of Mexico.  Georgetown academic Dr. Michael  Eric Dyson,MIT Professor Noam Chomsky,  Howard Zinn, Professor Ward Churchill, Professor Ron Radosh,Ted Cruz, and Henry Louis Gates are among the multiple people featured in this documentary. However, the one area that did elicit uncomfortable feelings was when Dsouza connected President Obama and Hillary Clinton with the late political activist Saul Alinsky.  Dsouza featured voice recordings of Alinsky admitting to having an objective to convince a millionaire donor to give away a large part of his money towards his cause on a Saturday and he implied little qualms about the potential of that same millionaire to be executed on a Monday. I was truthfully hoping that it was just some false doctored recording, however it did sound genuine. I looked up some information on Saul Alinsky which mentioned about one of his last interviews that he had with Playboy magazine. Alinskys feelings on where he preferred to go if there was an afterlife (even if he was just joking) did kind of match (in a scary way) with how Dsouza was portraying Alinsky in the documentary. There is much more this documentary that I just included in the review (I even have more of the notes I took in a notebook).  However, I felt compelled to include information on why my political beliefs were turned upside down after being exposed to America: Imagine A World Without Her by Dinesh DSouza and John Sullivan.",1417046400,4,3512,5.07105719237435

He draws you into the movie and helps you understand the answer.  This is well worth the watch and worth having friends over to see.  It will stimulate discussions about key issues for our future.

6485255,5,B00LG7VWIA,"I have NEVER written a product review. In my entire life! I know that's selfish and I know I'm in a minority among you all (who have probably written hundreds of reviews), but I had to log-in and leave a review for this movie...

I feel compelled to write this review mainly due to the films condemnation by ""main-stream"" critics. This includes the 5.8 rating (out of 10 stars) on IMDB.com. This is absurd and a movie like this deserves some positive press to offset the obviously politically-driven negative...

This movie is awesome! I'm a born and raised American citizen, but this movie is truly inspirational for those born here and those that immigrated here (legally) to pursue the American Dream. The film does a great job of objectively addressing the biased claims of American greed and oppression drilled into us by our politicians, media (news and celebrities) and the people influencing our future generations (professors and teachers).

Go into this movie with an open head. Think logically about what is going on in our country and look critically at those men and women who say they are working hard for the ""American People"", but who really have more sinister motives in mind.

Folks make no mistake, we are all under attack on many levels. I'm concerned as a 30-year old man (with no children) about where the nation is headed. If we continue on the path (and allow our ""masters"" known as the Government) we are on, our children (and their children) are going to have only a fraction of the quality of life which we experience today...

Watch this movie. It has some great history and really makes you think about where we are headed (and it ain't good unless we change). John and Dinesh did an excellent job!",1416614400,2,1727,4.724252491694352

6485257,5,B00LG7VWIA,"The problem with reviewing a movie (or book) like this is that the content is so politically driven that you learn the biases of the reviewer without even reading the actual review. I gave it five stars, so therefore I must hate Obama and blindly follow the GOP. I have also seen people giving negative reviews and writing that the movie was poorly directed or worse than a college documentary. These people are obviously letting their politics also slant their honest opinion of the movie. So, as to the content of the movie, I don't believe a my review would change your mind one way or another. As for the actual quality of the documentary itself, I thought it was well produced and directed. It looked better than 95% of the documentaries out there on the subject ( walking with dinosaurs on Discovery was awesome though) and 99% of the college documentaries. Asking myself, would I sit down and watch a Spike Lee or Michael Moore documentary? I would with some skepticism. So, I would hope the same for the progressive, liberal, democrat.

I think the bits about Columbus, Lincoln, the trail of tears, abolition of slavery, maintaining the union, and foreign policy are thoroughly neoconservative in the narrative.  Half truths are put forward.  The extent of the bloodshed is not nearly accurate.  The assumed importance of the union is logically inconsistent with limited government/freedom.  The military industrial complex is not acknowledged its role in foreign policy, etc.  I don't know how he manages to discuss the American Indians and the trail of tears without mentioning Sherman's absolutely genocidal views towards them.  I think he actually denies it.  I'll never understand how the idea of limited government can still be reconciled with a massive ""union"" and national government created by none other than the father of the Republican party.  This idea of independent states or even the limited central role of a federation the founders intended is absolutely lost within mainstream conversation.

I think typical of a neocon however, he is fully aware of the role of the radical left of the mid 20th century in today's affairs.  However, instead of dealing with them using understanding and discussion, it is put forward with disdain, fear, and is intended to drive a wedge between would be compatriots.  Freedom implies differences of opinion.

By the end of the film its safe to say that as a Rothbardian, I still walked away proud to be American.  However fully aware of government failures and oversteps.  I love the fact that as Americans we have such a high standard of living, and it is a shame to see that under attack by the fabian socialists and Alinskyite welfarists.",1416441600,,1706,5.175182481751825

The filmmaker, Dinesh D'Souza, never demonized nor ridiculed his opposition, but gave their arguments a fair amount of consideration. The pro-America responses were fair and well-reasoned.

The only real critiques I have of the film are that the subtitle is a bit misleading (although he does ask us to consider what would happen if the Revolutionary War had been a British victory and there's speculation about what Mexico would be like if America never took Texas, California, and the other border states). Also, there's more information in the book than the movie, and some things were left out of the movie that I was hoping wouldn't be.

I know this because I served in the military both overseas in the desert and at the Pentagon and NSA during this expansion. again it was a great show until you started to turn the facts on their head to make a Republican TV commercial. anyway none of this really matters because the US will be entering its golden age within 40 years and we have at least 200 more years as a superpower.

Yes, for the first time I consider my life experience to be fortunate, as I always thought it was full of unfortunate events that I experienced first hand while living in the opposite system of communist/dictatorship Cuba.

To my dismay, I often wondered if the people criticizing and tagging ""America"" as evil have ANY idea of what they are saying unless doing it for an agenda. Just because a professor at a University, or a particular media outlet, or a teacher at a particular school with a book or a church etc says it is, does not make it true. I lived the opposite, and it taught me to view things from the center, not left, not right, and I must say, this film hit the nail on the head. I would encourage people to do research of their own and generate their own conclusions by historical facts without agendas.

One of my often many questions.

Slavery.

Half my ancestors were slaves at one point in Cuba, one was the first black Senate in Cuban history, Afro-Cuban writer and Cuba's first black Senate Martn Mora Delgado, and yes Cuba had slaves, just like the rest of the World had slaves at one point in time from different races and origins. So why single point America when the World was guilty way before (and still is) of such thing?

Thanks to this film for bringing out to light that is not America and it's capitalistic ways at fault but some individuals at play, ""Even blacks were slave owners"". Why are those facts hidden from the books?

My last name is french, so I have French, Spaniard, African, German, Italian and Native American in me ( yes, Cuba had native also). So yes, I'm familiar with Alexis de Tocqueville..

My horrific fear to step foot in America as a young man based on what communist Cuba taught me was quickly vanished once here, and I must say that just as Alexis de Tocquevilla observations were, this land has far more good people/organizations doing very good deeds than those doing the bad, and a single government could never do such deeds on its own as that would only lead to a Cuban type dictatorship via corruption. STAY AWAY FROM THAT!

Sure USA is a Superpower, maybe the lone Superpower today, but make no mistake, it is as good as it would ever be, God forbid such 'lone' tittle falls under some other nations I won't even mention.

America is in general a warm place with warm people offering a humanitarian hand and values, and yes I experienced good and bad here in America, but the good far, and I mean far exceeds the bad, with a system that although not perfect is the best there is, and I hope the World takes notes and mimics it.  Just take a look at the rest of the World now and throughout history and tell me if there is better.

""Some people"" may want to dismiss the content as propaganda, and I have seen propaganda films, but they are usually promulgating lies, while this movie is not a lie.

The 5th star is missing because I did not quite catch the ""Imagine the world without Her"" part of the title in the movie content, but, then again, I was expecting some kind of alternative universe scenario with goose-stepping Nazis parading down the main streets of all the towns in the world.

Presents good reason's why people should be proud of America and why people should be concerned by a socialist agenda that more and more people are trying promote.  You would really have to watch the film to get everything the author is trying to get across. America IS a great place and always has been.  America for the most part was built into a great nation by Godly people who tried their best under God.  Of course mistakes were made.  We are only human after all.  But the author shows that America has been and continues to be one of the best and sometimes only force for good in the world. If you think badly of America you should compare it to any other country at any other time in history and see how they stack up against each other. And I don't mean read some propaganda book....I mean read some real history books where you can verify the facts.  Not just read one slanted history book.  Read three or four to make sure you get the facts correct because, as presented in this film some people have written factually incorrect ""history books"" to promote their own agenda.
What IF there were no America to stop Hitler?  Without America Germany surely would have developed the atom bomb during an extended WWII period.  Without America how much of China would Japan have taken during WWII?  I think people should really stop and think about what a world without America would have been like.

I think what makes this so powerful is that it's so respectfuly done and thereby respects the viewer as intelligent. He does not ever resort to 'personal' attacks. He focuses on ideas, concepts and disects them (are you listening Democrats? assuming people think they way you do and hamering that home is not a way to 'communicate' with people ie. the midterm results). Mid way he starts to counter the ideas (not people) not by 'demonizing' people like Noam Chomsky. He presents what these people say and write. Just puts it out there in a very balanced not inflamatory way. He also presents things Lincoln said. Surprisingly the most moving part is what Bono has to say.",1416009600,2,1024,4.662983425414365

Many people blindly follow Howard Zinn and D'Souza has done a great job of exposing the flaws in his work that drives the anti-American attitude that pervades the minds of so many impressionable teens and young adults.

6485362,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Great insight into why the left is so bent on destroying America and how they are so easily manipulated into following false profits.  It's interesting, yet also disturbing to observe how one twisted individual like Saul Ainsky, who rallies for a government to control the people, just not himself, can so deeply infiltrate the fabric of a nation for his own selfish desires.  The individuals who built this country from nothing were anything but selfish, instead desiring a nation that would continue into perpetuity for the benefit of it's citizens and not just a ruling class.  America was built on Christian values to unleash the power of individuals in order to advance their talents with a government limited in power by those same individuals.  The liberties our forefathers died to acquire for us all are now under attack by a political party in search for utopia, at anyone else's expense.  Of course, those at the top of the utopian ladder like Hillary Clinton, Barack Hussein, Michael Moore, and others fully expect to be exempt from their world view of socialism.

This film is full of truths and logical information (both disdained by the left) that help not only to understand the flawed logic of the socialist left, but how to counter the lies that the left so blindly and dearly cling to.

The film is hard to watch at times because of the complete idiocy of the left, but is well presented, fun to watch, and an uplifting reminder of how completely awe inspiring the United States of America came into being and still is.

It presents the case against America, then presents the other side that academia and the media doesn't tell you. I was surprised over and over because like most people I believed the narrative that America had done horrible things as though it was alone in the sins of mankind.  What Dinesh puts forward is not so much as an excuse put a complete picture of how far mankind has come--and how this evolution came forth primarily BECAUSE of America.  One particular thing that was to me profound was the fact that there was slavery in every nation and there are still slavery in some places today; where America stands alone is the fact that she fought a war over it.

This is a movie written by an immigrant that came here 30 years ago--and fell deeply in love with America.  It does more to stroke one's patriotism than any song, any poem, or any picture.  It is simply a love story.",1415577600,3,957,4.409090909090909

6485424,5,B00LG7VWIA,"This is a must purchase for showing friends and family.  D'Souza starts out making all the usual cases that America has behaved badly.  Then D'Souza proceeds to demonstrate unequivocally that America's motives have not been evil at all and her actions have always help those who the left says we hurt.  Two glaring examples:
  Lefties agree with the faction of Mexicans and Americans of Mexican heritage who contend that the U.S.A. stole part of Mexico's territory in the Mexican war.  D'Souza explains that we fought along side Texans who wanted to be sovereign and choose their own destiny in their disputes with Mexico over their common border, their independence, and their sovereignty.  By the time Santa Anna capitulated the U.S. Army had conquered all of what was then (and currently) Mexico as well as what is now several Southwest states.  Then we proceeded to let Mexico's ruling class (Spanish) keep the territory they hold to this day, which according to many begs the question, 'What percentage of today's Mexicans wish they had become a permanent part of the U.S.A.?'
  D'Souza also puts in perspective the Sioux Nation's claim that the U.S.A. should return their land to them.  D'Souza asks why when by rights then one could argue that the Sioux should in turn return ""their"" land to the several tribes from whom the Sioux themselves stole it.  Sounds like the Sioux should examine their current motives and weigh them against their history.",1415577600,3,1456,4.971074380165289

Dr. D'Souza's film portrays that, that each of us our important in our own way - not the way of criminal beureaucrats who get people illegally arrested, who use abuse of power to illegally force people out of their homes, and so much more.  When there is corruption, we have to resist it, or it will continue to fester and we are selling our freedom to the scums that are damaging our country right now.

D'Souza identifies five such indictments directly from the leftists who propose them, then presents a logical, historically correct counterargument to each, demonstrating that these ""transgressions"" are deeply flawed, and based on nonexistent facts, or on facts that have been twisted to fit the left's agenda.

One of the most interesting bits of leftist history D'Souza uncovered was that Saul Alinsky was a disciple of Mafia boss Frank Nitti (whom Alinsky called ""Professor"").

6485463,5,B00LG7VWIA,"This movie is intelligent, brave and (sadly) necessary.

Dinesh D'Souza goes directly to the living (or archival) Socialist sources and listens respectfully to their overwrought indignation over what they see as the inherent unfairness/hypocrisy of the USA - a country they imagine the world would be far better off had we not existed. He respectfully confronts and draws out the concerns of those who would wish to 'fundamentally transform the USA"".

He lists their incriminations w/accuracy and fairness, and then goes about addressing each incrimination w/honest (and very interesting) information. The genius of D'Souza's approach is that he doesn't deny the horror of something like slavery, for instance, he simply balances that truth w/parts of the slavery story that Socialist revisionists have been hell-bent on eliminating from our American story in order to further their goals of a fundamental transformation that intends to reduce our greatness into Marxist mediocrity.

What we get via imagining a world w/out America is a compelling presentation of a broader view of our extraordinary country's historical legacy. D'Souza has not only succeeded in a reclamation of our proud history, but in his intellectually rigorous apologia for the greatness of the USA, manages to reclaim classical liberalism as the authentic core of the Conservative position.

As a person descended from an indentured servant, I found it refreshing to see someone acknowledge their existence and the conditions under which they had to work or how they became indentured.  Their contribution was always negated by the slavery issue.  The truth about it felt like a relief.  America is a great place.  My ancestors have been in America since the mid-1600s.  They came from different places and for different reasons (one fleeing the English Civil War) but all generations have fought in one war or conflict or another because they believed in America and what it stood for.  I agree with what Bono said about America.  I wish that more Americans would be motivated to self-educate or go to college to learn what time didn't permit  you to learn in high school.  I am a teacher.  Teachers don't create what we are prescribed to teach but as a teacher in my own classes I always find a place to interject the truth of events.  Great movie.

There are topics covered here which we don't often hear or speak about, but are at the core of some of the issues dragging our nation down.  I learned a good deal of information we are not normally given.  The film does a great job of explaining and debunking the foundations of a great deal of the anti-American sentiment present today. It was good to see a segment on Alinsky was included, though I felt it could have been made more powerful by showing exactly the manner in which Obama and others use his exact taught  radical methods today.

The only area I felt could have been improved from my standpoint, was the manner in which I thought the movie would be presented from the opening scene.  I thought it would be sort of a ""Christmas Carol"" type approach showing what the workd would look like had America not existed, and showing the overwhelming influence the United tates has had on the world.  Many on the left are taught the hatred and resentment, but they can't explain the details of why in a coherent manner other than ""that's just how it is"".  Demonstrating to them exactly more of what type of world or nation they would live in had things been just slightly different from our founding would have been great. Showing them what it is like to live in a third world country, or even another advanced nation without American protection and influence would be an indisputable and powerful teaching method.",1415318400,,1480,4.600760456273764

Although this book deals with some incredulous accusations from a biased left wing viewpoint, D'Souza handles them in a professional manner, and you can tell he truly respects the people offering differing opinions (even if he doesn't always agree with them).

Dinesh D'Souza explains how we must not lose American ideals. There is quite a political debate present here. Political systems dominated by two parties can stagnate a nation. One man in a pivotal political position can stagnate the process and ultimately the nation. No single person is greater than the Constitution and what the founding fathers established.

To diminish freedom surreptitiously and overtly is incomprehensible. Dinesh D'Souza's approach is practical, intellectual and spiritual. It is a multifaceted approach. The great leaders are behind us. The likes of Washington and Lincoln are no longer to be found. There are really no men of vision or leadership on the horizon.

6485533,3,B00LG7VWIA,"Producers present a theory to contradict the ""United States of America and the european conquerors of North America are evil beneficiaries of their oppression of others"" view point. Neither story line is fully supported by a careful analysis in this presentation.  Perhaps a thoughtful critic of both world views is too much to ask from a movie.

Truth lies between these points of view. People of european descent, who, for now, hold economic and political power and represent the majority in the USA, did not historically treat others fairly and with respect and do not always do so today both domestically and internationally. Historically, people of european descent, were not the only people who oppressed others, or worse, for personal gain. Oppression, slavery, war and conflict have recurred throughout human history from time we formed small family based bands for mutual support and defense. Democracy, freedom and free trade as practiced today in North America and much of the developed world is far from perfect. They are the best implementations, so far, of collective human organization bringing benefits to people around the world.

We humans, need to improve on our past.  The future best practice will should bring more freedom, liberty and free trade to the people of the world not less.  Will differences in the human condition persist. Yes but likely the life of the poorest among us will continue to improve and the ecological health of the planet not decline.

Unlike liberal documentaries of the same sort, Dinesh doesn't blindly flounder around on a few personal ideologies, hoping the viewers are uniformed and/or un-educated, willing to swallow anything you say as fact or truth. Here is a man who came from another country, pursued his American Dream, and now wants the rest of America to wake up, realize what is happening to the country, turn off MSNBC, CNN, and do something before it's too late.

6485579,3,B00LG7VWIA,"Being an independent voter who is more left than right, I have to say that watching this documentary has been slightly eye-opening.  Just to start with....I believe in healthcare for all, I don't believe in cutting across the board on taxes (we need to fund services such as police, fire, and schools), and I do believe corporate america does have regulation problems that  needed to be addressed.  However, I also go to the right on immigration (people should have to enter the country legally by the laws set forth already (not given amnesty), welfare recipients should be reviewed and stripped of benefits if they are able to work, and social programs (not required services) should be reviewed and cut if the financial support does not make sense, and the minimum wage should not be increased to $15/hour. I also still think that Native Americans were robbed of their land with deceptive practices (think about the circumstances before King Phillip's War) and that successful corporations and people should have to pay their fair share (close tax loopholes).  However, that being said, this was a good point of view on how to look at events from the other side.  Some can consider it truth and others will consider it political garbage. I consider it to be a little bit of both.  It's interesting the way slavery is brought up and how some freed slaves embraced having their own slaves.  If Obama and Hillary Clinton were left out of it, it would have come across to me as a more of a truthful documentary rather than a one-sided Republican attack.  He should have just stayed on the five points without including Democrat bashing and it would have come across a little more believable for me.",1414886400,5,1697,4.787671232876712

I'm a history major and this documentary tells the history of the United States and it's Constitution as it really happened --- not politically correct.  The documentary does NOT gloss over the issues of slavery or treatment of Native Americans --- but tells the true story leaving out no details.  I liked the way Dinesh placed America into context with what was taking place in the REST OF THE WORLD while our great nation was growing.

America is unique and this documentary highlights those differences beautifully.  I find it ironic that an immigrant who came to America made this documentary and not a natural born citizen.  It seems we tend to take things for granted in this country, things like free speech, capitalism, unlimited opportunity.  The sky's the limit ~ you just have to want it and put your energy and passion toward your goals.

When my wife and I saw it in the theater we were the youngest people there, and we are in our 50s.  This is a sad indicator of why America is in decline.

Young people often vote based upon what their friends express in social media, which is often rooted in activist causes.  They just want legalized Marijuana, gay rights, women's rights, and free stuff.  But the very freedoms that make such liberal ideals even possible in America are now in jeopardy.

Young people must carry the torch one day but I'm afraid that revisionist history has ruined the foundation from which they will govern.

""America"" almost made me cry.  The first quarter of the film is interviews with prominent revisionist historians, some of whom have been referenced by my own teachers and professors.  D'Souza lists the ""charges"" against America, and methodically destroys them with the real history of our great nation.  This is a beautifully shot, wonderful documentary.

This is a movie that every american should see at least once. It is indeed thought provoking. It has a freshness and frankness that forces introspection into the soul of America. This movie examines the tough questions that looks below the surface. What makes our country unique? What has made America great as a nation throughout history? It is amazing that such an honest examination is even possible in this age of sensorship, a.k.a. (political correctness), which threatens one of the very liberties that we are guaranteed as citizens of this country, (the freedom of speech). It was eye opening to me to learn that key officials and individuals behind the scenes have been promoting the wrong message. It is important for americans to realize that we have a voice and that it is not too late to move things in a positive direction for our future and for the future of our country. Self examination is sometimes painful, but it is ultimately good for the soul. Go see this movie or read the book, especially before you go vote in the election. You may change your mind about who you choose to vote for. The issues that D'Souza has brought up should be a part of national debate among our political leaders.

6485702,1,B00LG7VWIA,"America: Imagine The World Without Her (hereafter simply referred to as America for simplicitys sake) is a myopic and nave filmic essay espousing the greatness of the United States in much the same way a third graders essay would likely do so.  It is built upon poorly-staged reenactments, anecdotal evidence and argument from authority.  No hard data is cited and most sides of an argument are presented as showing a single person for and a single person against the issue, often times leading to a false equivalency between two opinions w/r/t history.  To call the film propaganda is to give it too much credit.  Unlike Dinesh DSouzas previous film, 2016: Obamas America, this film fails to even give us some juicy, absurd conspiracy theories to ridicule.  The films about as entertaining, even ironically, as watching a cowboy waiving a flag and shouting MERICA!!! for an hour and 45 minutes.

Yes, this film is brought to us by convicted felon Dinesh DSouza, who has to keep making films to try to influence public opinion since hes now lost his right to vote by pleading guilty.  Does that sound like a cheap shot to you?  Perhaps it would be, if the film didn't provide us with a (staged) shot of DSouza in handcuffs as he pretty much blames Obama and the National Security apparatus for him being there.  Never mind that he had people donate money to a candidate he supported and then reimbursed them to get around campaign finance laws.  Oh no.  he was singled-out, you see, because he made a film that tried to stop Obama from being reelected. The film didn't work (much as Fahrenheit 9/11 failed to oust George W. Bush), and I think Obama has more important things to worry about than going after DSouza for revengeespecially since DSouza was guilty and admitted guilt in court.  I mean, Obamas not Chris Christie, who will shut down a bridge for petty revenge. But if nothing else, DSouzas films reveal the mans ridiculously huge ego, and I have no doubt he truly believes that Obama lies awake at night  seething with rage about DSouza and plotting ways to get back at him for making his previous film. Delusions of Grandeur, thy name is Dinesh.

In addition to Obama, this new film takes aim at Howard Zinn, Saul Alinsky (who many Conservatives despise even as they make use of his rules in their own campaigns and political careers), Hillary Clinton, and Matt Damon.  Not since Team America: World Police has Matt Damon been taken to task on film for no real reason.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are largely Libertarians and have a beef with Left-Wing Hollywood, at least spread the criticism around to any famous person who talked about politics publicly during the Bush years (and yet don't see the irony of taking famous people to task for expressing political opinions while they, themselves, are famous people expressing their political opinions regularly).  Dinesh decides to just pick on Matt Damon because in 1997s Good Will Hunting he name checked Zinns A Peoples History of the United States in one line of dialogue.  Damon has gone on to talk about politics since 1997, and has made a few political movies such as the 2012 anti-fracking Gus Van Sant film Promised Land, but Dinesh really only cares about the Zinn shout-out.  Later, Dinesh interviews a man in an attempt to refute Zinns book simply by claiming Zinn isn't a historian.  No evidence is given to back up this assertion, and no specific passages or false claims from his book are presented to be refuted.  The film merely stops at the ad hominem attack.  DSouza likes ad hominem because it is easy and requires no research.  For instance, rather than cite examples of why this film is bad, I could merely try to discredit DSouza by telling you that despite his credentials as a Conservative Christian, he was cheating on his wife and, while still married, brought his mistress to public functions, introducing the mistress as his fianc.  I could then claim that this film is bad because DSouza is a cheating, hypocritical jerk.

Thats the thing, though.  Whether DSouza is a bad human being or not doesnt automatically mean that his film is bad or that its assertions are incorrect.  If I was playing by DSouzas handbook, however, all I would do is show a clip of DSouza saying something he believes, deliver a snarky yet pompous voice-over that basically boils down to me saying oh really?, and then play a longer clip of another person, who I introduce as an expert of some sort (Argument from Authority), telling me DSouza is wrong but not citing any evidence to the contrary. There, Ive just taken you to the Dinesh DSouza School of Documentary Filmmaking.  Oh, and if you want to be like DSouza, you have to insert many superfluous shots of yourself while you interview someone, with your brow furrowed and your lips slightly pursed, because that will make you look interested and pensive.  Oh, and you have to shoot your interview subject with part of their face cut off and off-center from the frame, so your film looks cutting edge and important (or sloppy, whatever).

When hes not resorting to Argument from Authority or ad hominem, DSouzas basic argument is that of a kid who wants to stay up past his bedtime and, when their parent refuses, responds with but so and so at my school gets to stay up.  In response to the criticism of America stealing land from the Native Americans, the film argues that this is okay because different tribes conquered different tribes to acquire land, so its okay because Chief so and so did it.  Apparently DSouzas mother never scolded him by saying that just because everyone at school jumps off a bridge, it doesnt mean its right for you to also do it.  The other argument here is, of course, that might makes right.  If you kill the people on top of the land, you somehow deserve the land.  This is DSouzas main argument when it comes to the criticism of America taking land from Mexico.  We fought a war, we won that land fair and square, suck it, Mexico!  This is followed by DSouza bravely attacking the idea that Mexico is a better place to live than the United States, an assertion made by no one, anywhere, ever.  No one fearlessly takes down a straw man like DSouza.  It also showcases one of the films weird blind spots:  it has a weird black-and-white thinking in which people can only be divided into America-Lovers and America-Haters.  The truth, apparent to anyone who is not either a child or DSouza, is that people can love America without thinking its perfect and either whitewashing and ignoring its flaws and wrongdoing, and people can hate America but still believe its better than a many other countries on Earth, and would prefer to attempt change it and make it better from the inside rather than jump ship and give up on it.  Thats right; we can add another logical fallacy to DSouzas bag of tricks: False Dilemma.

Lets not even spend too much time on DSouzas handling of slavery.  He shows us one woman who overcame slavery to become a self-made millionaire, points out that there were many Black slave owners as well as White ones (I guess his point isI don't know, exactly, as that doesnt exonerate America from its slaveholding past, but is perhaps to assuage White Guilt?  Dinesh is Indian-American, which makes it odd if hes concerned with modern Whites feeling undo guilt over slavery), points out that other nations in the world had slavery too (so that gives America a pass?), and then champions the Civil War as showing America is awesome because it was willing to fight a war to end slavery.  Okay, except many nations were able to end slavery without wars.  He also gives the Founding Fathers a pass on allowing slavery while proclaiming liberty because PRACTICALLY they couldn't hold a new nation together if they outlawed it.  Never mind that pragmatic concerns don't absolve someone of being morally reprehensible, but it also reveals that DSouza seems to believe that the Founding Fathers actually had a desire to free the slaves (some likely did, it was a rather large group of people, but then some like Jefferson had a lot, raped a few of them, and made no effort to free their own) and believed they would be free eventually.  DSouza makes no effort to whitewash the Founding Fathers only giving rights to white, land-owning men, though.  The movie can only be so long.

 DSouza tries to make Vietnam sound like a good idea, and claims that Iraq wasn't an imperialist war because America didn't take the oil for itself.  No, but it took it away from a country that had it nationalized and delivered it into the hands of private corporations.  DSouza also ignores a long history of the United States sticking its nose into the private affairs of other countries and CIA-backed missions that resulted in democratically elected leaders being ousted in favor of totalitarian thugs that were west-friendly.  DSouza spends the least amount of time defending the claim of America as an imperialist country perhaps because he knows he has no leg to stand on here.  He also has recreated scenes of a solider in Vietnam being tortured, but makes no mention of the United States torturing its prisoners in the early 2000s.  Does that mean another country has the right to invade us as we did Vietnam?  He also ignores the atrocities the South Vietnamese government also committed but, hey, we don't have time for details like that.

Lastly, DSouza makes an effort to defend Capitalism by showing that many countries are embracing it, especially in the third-world.  Sure, when you can get labor at 1 cent an hour you can make a lot of profit.  DSouza is more concerned with looking at the entrepreneurs at the top, though, and not the sweat shop workers.  He also ignores inherited wealth, and money that is not made on entrepreneurial labor, or the fact that most of the really rich under capitalism make money off of capital (stocks, bonds, dividends, real estate, etc) and not by working hard or any of that American Dream stuff that Dinesh still believes in.  I also question his math in a scene where he claims a burger shop will make a mere 16 cent profit per burger (which can add up to a lot if you sell a lot of burgers, though) and that a person cant make a cheaper burger by going to the supermarket (which ignores the discount a burger place would make in bulk orders, as well as the fact that an individual buying their own lettuce and buns can make more than one burger  with those materials, thus making their homemade burgers individually cheaper even if the grocery bill to buy the materials is more than the price of a single burger).

When all is said and done, America is a slapdash collection of logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, straw man arguments, poor recreations, DSouzas naval-gazing, and childish arguments. This film does a disservice to the country is it named after.  D-",1414368000,52,10878,4.712097200211304

It was a complete pleasure to watch the movie (twice) and read the book as well.  I believe this movie and book should be taught in every American classroom as part of the education of the American youth.  They have not been getting the truth for decades and this would be a solid step in getting them to understand the true meaning of American exceptionalism.  I have even sent the movie to friends and family who have not had the opportunity to see it.",1414195200,8,991,4.377049180327869

Rather, it serves as a clarion reminder of the loftiness our founding principles aspired to. It reminds us how those principles and freedoms and the documents that spelled them out have lifted us as the heirs of this grand experiment, and the watching world around us.

In areas it glossed too quickly on complicated subjects claiming to ""check the box"" on certain arguments, that seemed not yet ready for the verdict call, but yet always enough to give pause to the wise judge who would say... I need to hear more. In other areas it rang so clear as to have proven no case needs be made.

This movie showed the movement of those building a negative narrative, oppressive, and controlling to stifle the actual true vision of why America is what it is supposed to represent, 'The American Dream.'  Our country, our citizens who are made up of all immigrants, has been split into cultural derisiveness.  A great unveiling of what is happening today, with our President, Congress and Judicial branch as well as statehood. It exemplified the incredible African-American woman in the early 1900's, truly  an American  success story who developed and marketed her own line of hygienic products. She embraced the Amerccan Dream. And it touched upon those who were once slaves who had slaves which I was unaware of until this movie. It's historical aspect should be seen by all young civic students.  Also, great interviews with those who hate our country yet

6485732,5,B00LG7VWIA,This film is a refreshing rebuke to the ongoing narrative of the past five decades or so that has been promoted by the academic and media elites and embraced by some politicians that America or the US is undeserving of its role as a world leader with no moral authority. This is evidenced by the vast majority of film critics and academics and their open hostility in regards to D'Souza's attempt to discredit the ongoing narrative without whitewashing several controversial subjects concerning America's past. The Left has done a good job of gaining control of the levers of power in this this nation and this documentary does a good job of countering their propaganda.

As Dinesh discusses points of "" American Shame"", I found myself uncomfortable, but then he systematically , logically, with experts and scholars goes beyond the narrative and examines the truth of our history. The result of his examination of conveniently "" left out"" truths reminds us all that though imperfect, we have much to be proud of.  Everyone should see this film here in America, and all parents of college students especially need to understand the shame doctrine being taught to their children. Watch it with your college student and discuss it.  Show it at your youth group meetings... Time for us to truly be "" United We Stand"" as Americans and patriots, proud and strong. This movie will move you, rally you, and inspire you. It will also make you wonder why we have Professors teaching at major institutions in this country who despise this country and are allowed to infect our youth with a very skewed interpretation of our past.

6485751,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Who has shaped the general view of American History? Teachers, college professors, the media, right? They take speaking English, voting and inexpensive food for granted. They send their children to Catholic schools, and they themselves graduate from Ivy league schools, founded by Christians, yet they accuse any Christian narrative of history as biased, ignorant and racist. And most dangerously, they have the view that America is some form of intolerant uber-evil empire. Notice that most of these people have been Americans all their lives? They suffer from the virus of familiarity, which leads to the disease of contempt.

Dinesh, unlike his liberal counterparts, does not start out with outrageous claims of atrocities, or straw-man arguments that attack individuals. Instead, following the rules of sound reasoning, he attacks the arguments of these people with researched facts (also known as verifiable, unchanging truth). He deals with the fact that owning slaves wasn't a white only affair. He asks why America the nation has to be villanized for the what the Spaniards did generations before there was even the first state. He demonstrates, in the process of answering the major arguments that America is far from the uber-evil empire the bitter intellectuals and other discontents hate (while still enjoying it's prosperity and protection of course). What is revealed in the end is that America represents the highest hopes of humanity, albeit expressed and applied by imperfect, yet noble people. It is a place where hard work and ambition are rewarded. It is a place for noble freedoms: freedom of religion, commerce, and thought. It is the land of the self-sufficient, free thinker.

I walked away from the movie knowing that I was a part of a unique, beautiful, rare moment in history. Without America what would there be? Take a look at the Middle East (except Israel, who follows the American model of government). Take a look at Asia (except South Korea and Japan, who respect the benefits of a free society). The bitter intellectual opposes America for the same reason they oppose Christianity: the simple can understand and enjoy it without having to bow at the feet of the learned. It is a simple, yet profound idea, not just a set of boundaries. It's a system setup for people who want to persue virtues, not a system where the schrewd and violent practice vices at the expense of everyone else. America is a miracle. This film, with simple facts and reason, demonstrates that precisely.",1414108800,,2512,5.094660194174757

To see how being spoon fed information from the left affects us all...no matter how resistant to it we may think we are. The first half of the movie is all the crap that the left uses to justify that the U.S. is a very flawed nation based on its history. The last half answers these claims and shows that while we have certainly made mistakes....we have done far more good than bad. Furthermore the major accusations like slavery....the conquest of the native americans...japanese internment camps etc. weren't quite what they have been presented. For example I was unaware that many freed blacks became slaveowners. Nor was I aware that many native american tribes had stolen their land from the mexicans years before.

At the end of the film we had tears, applauded Mr. D'Souza and felt more love for our country. Over the past few decades textbooks reflecting true American History is being eliminated within our education system.  Common Core is going into effect throughout the country and I expect that truth of our history and the patriotism will continue to decline. For each of us that watch this film, please share it with another person/family. Thank you Dinesh for embracing, standing and fighting for the love and patriotism that seems to be lost by so many born in this country. Together we can bring back truth and patriotism to America's future generations.",1414108800,,743,4.896825396825397

Love how he points out the good that has been done by Americans over the years throughout the world and how there is a pattern in conflict that Americans have not fulfilled, because we are one nation under God.

Arm your sons and daughters against the lies that they will be taught as truth... or at least let them see all the sides of the argument, something all your tuition money will not give them. This movie presents BOTH sides and shows why our nation and government is becoming something we no longer recognize.

America is going down hill fast, there is no denying that, however, there is still hope. And that hope lies with us. If you have seen D'Souza's ""2016"" then you know the future looks grim as long as Obama remains in office. This documentary, on the other hand, gives the facts like it is.

6485802,1,B00LG7VWIA,"Watching this right wing fear mongering paranoia peddling drivel was excruciating. A lot like sitting through two hours of Fox noise. At the conclusion Dinesh seems to be trying to recruit you into the tinfoil hat society as he works to convince you that you are being watched and you are unable to commit any crimes without getting caught. After all, it happened to him after he violated campaign finance laws. And that evil Saul Alinsky ideology of socialism that so many of the left subscribe to - he never mentions the athiest Ayn Rand that the right follows as he pushes the ""godliness"" of the founding fathers in his effort to convince us that America is a Christian nation. I felt like throwing a shoe at the TV. That's two hours of my life I will never get back. But I should also mention, the music in this movie is great. But it is not a saving attribute. Buy the soundtrack - skip the movie.",1414108800,24,902,4.4397590361445785

6485811,5,B00LG7VWIA,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Many points of view are presented.  But it always comes down to one basic truth. The history of our country shows how desperately people want and need the freedoms that were fought for so hard and continue to inspire the world today.  It is indeed ironic that we need to be reminded of America's worth by someone like Mr. D'Souza who emigrated and assimilated here to fulfill his American dream, as so many before him have done. When so many already born here do not know how to value what we have, this movie makes it easy to learn why we should!  Thank you for the hope you give us.

I feel strongly that this movie needs distribution in our public schools as a definite counter-balance to the prevailing progressive views that denigrate America's role and influence in the world.
See this movie. And be inspired!",1414108800,,864,4.584415584415584

I heard it was good, so my husband and I went to see it, not knowing anything about it. I have since purchased the digital copy of this film and watched it twice this week. After viewing the Dartmouth debate between Dinesh D'Souza and Bill Ayers this evening on YouTube, I wanted to watch America AGAIN! I am not one to watch a movie more than once in 3 or more years. My husband and I plan to put this on for every guest who comes to our house! We want all of our friends to see this!! Absolutely awesome. :) He reminds me of a young Ravi Zacharias. I'd love to hear a conversation between the two of them. One word of advice for Dinesh.. Check out Ken Ham's ""Foundations Series"" from AnswersInGenesis.com.

There are so many people who have created a negative view of our great country without realizing that America was often the FIRST to overcome some of the many issues that have plagued the world since the dawn of mankind.  D'Souza handles the topics without histrionics.

As an educator, I would recommend showing the first half/two-thirds of the film in public school classrooms, leaving out the portions regarding current history - the last third of the film or so.  The last portion of the film is excellent for older high school students and adults.  The first part is suitable for all ages.

6485868,5,B00LG7VWIA,"This book answered so many questions as to why my country seems to be going to hell in a hand basket. I was born in 1958 and while I can remember JFK, the Vietnam War, and the Watts riots, the world still seemed to have a measure of safety. Now, no one says much even when politics don't make sense. I feel that we largely watch the emperor in his new clothes. Liberals are killing this country. I had a roommate last year whose father got her hooked on heroin when she was young. Now she is 34 and acts like a little kid. She abused her baby and had to leave. Her husband, an undocumented immigrant and two-time felon, has had me subpoenaed three times this year and I may go to jail because I refuse to show up in court again. It is a hardship in many ways but particularly because the young woman, who is 34, is threatening members of my family and calls my landlady to cause trouble. This is America, friends. We are losing her and I am so grateful for Dinesh's book so that things can make sense to me. Leave it to an immigrant to speak of our nation so eloquently. I don't think people truly appreciate what we have had until they have lived without it. Thank you, Dinesh. My father was a veteran of the Korean War and a true Patriot.

I'm old enough to remember the American History that was taught in school as opposed to the revisionist versions currently being peddled as the truth.. It's a shame we have allowed the socialist elements in politics to manipulate several generations of people into believing all the wrong things. You didn't build that.. It isn't your fault, it's someone else's. When you have to worry about the IRS and the NSA, or the FBI and the EPA, and other government agencies coming after you for what you say or believe then there is a problem. Dinesh has got it pretty much right on. In this film he isn't so much a critic of Obama, as in 2016, but the movement that created him and others now in control.. You can't look at the latest series of history books or the internet to verify the things that the movie or the book point out.. Most of that is all but gone.. Erased or rewritten. You would have to go back to historical references from 60 years or older to understand what has happened.. America is still the greatest country on earth.. Are we perfect .. No.. But for those who have unwitting been mislead to believe we are not, makes me sad. I think this should be required viewing for all Americans..",1413763200,,1375,4.504

In it DSouza tackles the 5 big criticisms of America.  Frankly, I was wondering how he was going to do it in a 2 hour doc.

 Believe me these are the big ones:

1. Genocide of the Native Americans
2. Stealing land from Mexico
3. Enslaving African Americans
4. Enriching itself and committing atrocities in overseas wars and
5. Capitalists stealing the American dream from the workers of America.

I told you they were the big ones!

 He also basically trashes the required history reading in hundreds of universities in the form of the pseudo historian Howard Zinn and does an expose of the Methodist minister and his famous connection that influenced an impressionable Hillary Clinton in High School and at Wellesley.

This is clearly written in his ""Selected works of Mao"" series.

This movie has changed my life. I am urging liberal citizens who have a good heart to begin their healing process and consider watching this movie.

There are less than 25 people as of this point who have had anything under four stars to give this wonderful documentary however as a shopper I know that even one negative review can prevent me from purchasing something.

All of the negative reviews should be ignored, this is a movie that no matter your ideology will be incredibly thought-provoking and make you think. What I feel the majority of the negative reviewers are forgetting is that this is a documentary not a candidate running for president not a dictator wanting to take over not even someone talking to you on the street. How they can feel so threatened and enraged by a documentary is both astounding and laughable.

This is a movie that will truly make you remember why you love your country and make you question why so many within it hate it. I highly recommend both the movie and the book, if you are looking for entertainment and quick facts to use against the Wikipedia educated idiot then watch this documentary now; if you are looking for an in-depth analysis and more focused source of information read the book.

6485955,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Having ""just taken"" college world history and U S history courses (5 courses) I'm familiar with the slant presented by the profs.  Could be summed up in one sentence - ""Aside from art, West bad, everyone else good.""  The West obviously stole other nations technologies and philosophies then claiming them.
  Overall, current historical curriculum's reveal an astonishing lack of ""weight"" to contributions by the West.  Areas of education, charity, military evolution, industrial advances (they're apologized for) superior collaboration, the good points of government, etc.  Instead, Brevity is the byword.
  For example for 900 years the Catholic church WAS SOCIAL SERVICES AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION FOR THE ENTIRE CONTINENT.  Feeding and clothing hundreds and hundreds of millions.  Treating the sick.  Doing this through thousands of monasteries, churches, schools and outreach efforts.  Not to mention the unversities established.  What is presented rather, are the selected offensive, rich bishops having secret wives or village priests living off the backs of peasant.  And of course, who can forget the inquisition?  Which pales, by the way, to nothing against anti Catholic inquisitions in England.
  By contrast, a stark point of selflessness, is 90% of the priesthood died in the black plague, ministering to the dying.  Yet such is simply plowed under.  However, we certainly know about soup kitchens in New York city established during the depression.

  Regarding American history, far more lines are devoted to how many tribes were depopulated by Western incursion.  With marginal tribute to agricultural advances enabling far more people to be fed.  Instead urbanized Westerners are matched up against the ""natural"" peaceful locals living lightly off the land.  While there's real validity to aspects of native American farming practices, regarding their peacefulness, the name of the game lacrosse, is an Indian term for war.  Because war in Indian culture was an ever present reality.  But that's NEVER treated with any seriousness.  Cause they're simply victims.

  Therefore, I'm gonna cite an example of academic misrepresentation by omission.  Further, it's an example which not a single South American anthropologist would disagree with - ""the Aztecs nearly devoured the Yucatan peninsula.""  Yep.  Estimates of a minimum of 1% of the inhabitants of Central America  were sacrificed ANNUALLY by the Aztecs!  Some bonus years as high as 5%.  But the Aztecs were typically good stewards of their resources.  They liked the sport of man-hunting and it didn't do to kill off all the game.  And The Mayans weren't far behind in competition.
  In one three day orgy to the sun god, the Aztecs killed, beheaded, and then ate over 80,000 captives.  Oh yeah, a fact you rarely hear.  Yet, true and verifiable one nonetheless.  Though, one deliberately suppressed.
  In over-crowded Mexico City with its hundreds of thousands of slaves, all that protein didn't go to waste.  Sacrificed bodies ended up on dinner tables of rich and slave alike.  The upper class conducted ceremonial cannibalism.  While workers needed fed.  The rest went to farmlands for fertilizer and as well, into the lake to feed caiman and fish.

  Its now generally agreed by scholars, the Mayans threw so many bodies into limestone sinkholes, they corrupted and fouled their ground water, resulting in massive epidemics of cholera and typhoid.  Which ravaged the peninsula population, a population ten times of that today.  All nearly eradicated due to a constant and ruthless thirst for dominance and abominable religious rituals.  Again, a fact everyone simply dances around.  ""Ohhhh, that was just their Culture. We can't judge them for their cultural practices.""  Really?

  They'd rather dwell on the pottery, architecture, mathematics, and astronomy.  And certainly colorful murals.  Not upon the most brutal caste system ever devised by man putting all similar Western practices to shame.  A systematic whole scale genocidal depopulation of Central and South American tribes for religious, sporting purposes, and dominion.  Which had continued unabated for centuries!!!
  But scholars will instantly throw a flag at the ""treacherous barbaric Spanish.""  However, the very same Spanish who ended human sacrifice in Central and South America.  But what the heck, typical mean Europeans stomping on all the good clean native fun.

  Or how about those Carib Indians, real Choir boys!  Living in the Caribbean, the Caribs were head hunters and man eaters extraordinaire.  Making war against the most peaceful Indians on earth, the Arawak's, to extinction!  While sickness from Europe contributed much to their loss in the Eastern Caribbean islands, elsewhere the Caribs annihilated the Arawaks.  They ate 'em.
  Of course liberal academic types describe it this manner ...

  ""... tales of cannibalism and torture by these Caribs was never substantiated by Christopher Columbus.  Although the basis is well documented.  The Caribs  were not ""really"" cannibals but practiced rituals and ceremonies whereby they cut off the limits of their enemies and cook them.  Believing they would gain the skill and prowess of the opposing warrior.  It was a sign of respect and adoration for their enemy.""  ...
  Really?!!  Whoa, ... they weren't eating them, they were simply adoring them??!!  Well I just adore Kentucky fried chicken!
  Aside from the Caribs, the Karankawas and Tonkawas on the Texas and Mexican coasts were no slouches either.  Massive framed tattooed warriors much like Mauris, they were rough customers,  holding off even the feared Caribs.  They too served their foes up for barbecues.  Even Comanches from time to time on a plate.

6485961,5,B00LG7VWIA,"I was really shocked when I saw this movie.  The opening was really powerful.  The thought of there never being a George Washington is very shocking.  Seeing several landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty disintegrate makes your jaw drop..  The movie poses several excellent questions.  What would the world look like if there was no America?  Who would be around to defend freedom and liberty?  Who would be strong enough to stand up to tyrants and despots?  What would have been the outcome of two world wars if not for America leading the way?  Would there be a nation that offers the poor and oppressed an opportunity for a better life?

The movie also does a great job of exposing the repeated lies and messages of discontent and division preached by Liberals and a complicit media.  This is the stuff many kids aren't learning in school.  Instead, they are hearing that America is this supposedly evil place where people who want less government are oppressing the poor.  Dinesh shows Obamas connections to people like Saul Alinsky.  He maps out how Obamas message of hope and change has led to apathy and despair.

6485963,4,B00LG7VWIA,"I will have to say that I didn't enjoy this film of D'souzas as much as the first one, Obama's America 2016.  That documentary basically explored the background  of Barack Obama and how his world view differs from many Americans.

This movie explores not so much what would happen if George Washington got defeated at Gettysburg and we stayed a British colony, but what ideologies have existed in America and how they could tip the balance of a country that was founded as an independent nation with a government totally unlike any other nation with a Bill of Rights, Constitution, and emphasis on freedoms that are not always enjoyed in other cultures.

D'Souza points to individuals that have made an impact on certain of our leaders.  There is Frank Marshall, a card carrying communist who was an early mentor to President Obama.  Saul Alinsky who developed Rules for Radicals had not only Barack Obama as an admirer, but Hillary Clinton did a paper on him when she was in college.  She was enamored of his philosophy.  Bill Ayers and his wife Bernardine Dorn are also featured----homegrown terrorists who bombed government buildings, and would've killed military members and their families at a dance, but the bomb failed!  Bill Ayers was charged, but because of a well connected, rich dad got off.  His quote:  ""Guilty as hell, free as a bird.  Ain't  America a great country.""  He also regretted not doing more destruction and claimed that it was no worse than sending thousands of young men to their death in Vietnam.

Actors are used in many of the scenes, and I remember mostly the part of young Hillary meeting Saul Alinsky and spending time with him.  There are clips of Bill Ayers giving interviews.  By the way he was ""the guy in my neighborhood"" that Obama referred to.

Dinesh D'Souza as an immigrant from India, a totally different culture with a caste system, is totally on board with this country.  He admires the way one can achieve their dreams with effort, speak their mind, and go on to do things that make a difference to their quality of life as well as others.  But in this movie, it is cautioned that there are those that don't believe in this American dream, and that it can only be achieved by total control of minds, media, and education.",1410220800,10,2267,4.7055837563451774
6485964,2,B00LG7VWIA,"Of course people are going to see ""America"", it's such a patriotic sounding title, and the trailers insinuated that was the theme. The question was interesting, but a truck could be driven through the holes in the logic of your rebuttals to the five problems you presented. Then, true to form, you eventually turned to spewing misinformation, deception, and misinterpretations of the President's and Hillary Clinton's performance to this point. You conveniently forget about the six years the Republican party has done absolutely nothing. Opposing everything Obama proposed while publicly bragging many of them didn't even read some of the bills. They were willing to create complete gridlock while the country continued to suffer, all so they could assure Obama failed at everything he tried to do. McConnell's statement about the party's number one objective of making sure Obama is a one term president, bordered on traitorous. Their priority was not to help the country recover from the mess Congress collaborated to create in 2008. Not to protect the environment, not to help those Americans destroyed by the recession, not to prosecute the criminals who caused the crash, but to stop Obama at all cost (including the well-being of the country and its citizens). The Democrats are no better, as some have sided with the Republicans assuring the gridlock continues in order to vilify Obama. I'm not justifying the job Obama has done, he's failed in a number of ways. He has been a major disappointment to all who backed him in 2008 and 2012, and has been swallowed up by the ""good ole boy"", corrupted Congress, but the alternatives, McCain and Romney were both ""chameleon"" yes men who would have continued Bush's agenda of selling the country to corporate America, the banks, and Wall Street, while getting into more senseless wars (the rub is; it's all happening anyway).
Trying to pin the crap this country is drowning in on any one man is absurd, he had an amazing amount of help from a Congress that is so corrupt, arrogant, incompetent, back-stabbing, and dangerous, the dark road the country's on is no accident. Racism is alive and well in America, and is being practiced at the highest levels, namely Congress and the Supreme Court,  which sold the election process and results to the highest bidders. Supreme Court Judges also must be seriously reevaluated with the appointment process and the lifetime appointments being abolished.
Again, both parties are not representing their constituents and a large number of changes need to be made in the daily activities of all politicians and public servants. Unfortunately, the country's full of clueless, gullible, too lazy to check validity of information voters who are easily swayed one way or another by extremists with very devious objectives (does this sound familiar?). As long as Washington's able to keep the population hopelessly and hatefully divided over unresolvable social issues that should not be political issues, the problems will continue and increase in severity. But these convenient diversions come up every four years to deflect attention from real problems like the economy, jobs, education, healthcare, and senseless wars, all which candidates and politicians have no clue how to resolve. The entire country needs to stand up and demand responsibility from these politicians, hold them accountable for their actions, and to make it crystal clear who they're supposed to be working for, with consequences for any more of the toxic legislation they've relentlessly shoved down our throats. Sounds daunting, but this country has been through this before. Otherwise, our once great nation will become just another victim of empire self-destruction. There are a few things you left out of your movie about why the country is in such an endless free-fall, but I'm sure the omissions were not accidental or due to misinformation. Your movie was little more than more of the same toxic, biased, and misleading information the country's media sources have become renown for in order to perpetuate a hopelessly divided nation.",1410048000,17,4099,5.173192771084337

6485968,4,B00LG7VWIA,"America: Imagine the World without Her
 This Dinesh DSouza documentary currently plays at a slim 1,105 theaters across our wonderful land and has grossed a slender $13 million so far.  Terrible?  Nope, this is the 7th biggest grossing political documentary in history.  DSouza, born in India to Catholic parents and now a naturalized US citizen, also wrote and directed 2016 Obamas America with his partner John Sullivan.
 I do quibble with the title.  The film deals with several standard criticisms of the existence of America, not with what the world would look like if we had lost the War of the Revolution or even the War Between the States.  That would interest me, but the defense of our nation from her critics is a valid if misleading exercise.
 DSouza teams as a producer with Gerald R. Molen, again a team mate from this other film.  Molen produced over a dozen famous Hollywood films including Hook, Jurassic Park and Casper.  We don't know the budget for America but the production values are up to the professional mark which cannot always be said of films of this kind.
 DSouza makes the point that our alleged shortcomings are not unique to the USA in history.  Slavery has a history perhaps as old as humanity and no major culture anywhere can be innocent of this horror.  The USA however is unique in that we fought against slavery, spilling the blood of hundreds of thousands of men to, in Lincolns words expunge the stain of slavery from the soul of America.  Men by the thousand offered and gave their lifes blood to expunge that stain- not so the French.  Lincoln btw worked hard to become the first Republican President and even harder to end slavery.  A disgruntled Democrat slave fancier murdered him for his trouble.
 DSouza deals with other criticisms in a thorough way as well.
 The film lasts only one hour and 43 minutes and carries a PG-13 rating.  It gets an enthusiastic three and a half stars.  Post film interviews with the audience members gives in an A+ rating.  Patriots will relish this film.  The sound track is a powerhouse culminating with a version of The Star Spangled Banner by Madison Rising that will make you glad to be alive.
 DSouza points out that we no longer have Washington or Lincoln to inspire us, we only have ourselves. If this country is to be turned around we can look not to a hero, we will-each of us-have to become heroes in our own right.
 Bono of the Rock group U-2 had me in tears when he spoke of his view of America.  This is a great movie.

6485975,1,B00LG7VWIA,"Saw it in the movie theatre, tried to give it a fair shake but it brings to many abstract concepts and ideas together and reports clearly debatable matters as absolute facts(there is also a news network that does this). D'Souza keeps saying over and over how Obama has destroyed all of the things that make America great. Great hyberole but the real truth is even if Obama were inclined to do this he can not single handedly wreck this country, nor can he single handedly bring it out of it's malaise. He's just a guy from the other party who got elected fair and square whom conservatives don't like. Contrary to crazy notions brought by fact starved extremists guns aren't being collected, the UN isn't taking over and the constitution despite all the hysteria is alive and kicking. Dinesh D'Souza presents his views and this film as some type of unified theory of world politics. And of course America is at the top of the food chain. But my question is this, why can't we be at the top of the food chain because of our intellectual capabilities, not just because of our planet best military? Another relevant question  - if the movie actually lived up to it's title shouldn't it be almost entirely about other nations? How were they altered without America as a stabilizing force in world politics. How is Mexico different, England, Japan. How does Taiwan fare without an important treaty with the U.S? But these issues aren't explored. Instead D'Souza perseverates over one political party in this country. Yawn.

The beginning of the film depicts an authentic recreation of a battle in the Revolutionary War. And bummer of all bummers, the father of our country has his number called right at the start. If you want to imagine a world without Uncle Sam try reading the works of Harry Turtledove. But as the focus of a documentary it's just a silly concept, an unknowable thing. And btw since he went all the way back to 1776 to set up the movie crazy premise here's something conservatives conveniently forget to mention - by all accounts our founding fathers were crazy liberals! They were way ahead of their time in introducing concepts like freedom of assembly, freedom of the press. Given that history why is it that conservatives shun any forward thinking ideas that could help America right now, for instance the common core standards. Despite the considerable evidence that our kids are no longer getting a world class education they oppose this based on some abstract idea about Uncle Sam's overreach. Their thinking is - if Mississippi wants to give there kids a third rate education who is Uncle Sam to say otherwise?

After the 1776 battle the film flash forwards to the now, where he gets right to business hammering the President with unsupportable opinions. D'Souza, most would agree, is a complete political opposite to another documentary film maker - Michael Moore. Besides the success of their respective films a key difference is that Michael Moore will actually interview those on the other end of his political spectrum. In 'Capitalism a Love Story' he went to NYC and spoke with republican minded Wall Street Bankers. In 'Bowling for Columbine' he interviewed the head of the NRA. Here D'Souza mostly seeks out like minded people whose world views match his, for instance T. Cruz. The editorial review for the film states that D'Souza ""knocks down every important accusation made by progressives against our country."" That, right there, bears out the extremism of his thinking. What are the progressives accusing this country of? Of no longer providing world class K-12 education, of not providing health insurance to enough people? Of not having an actual energy policy? If America is going to continue to be a world leader it can't just be because of our military might. Our leaders are going to have to craft some new laws based on ideas from all sides- progressive, conservative and liberal ideas. This is commonly referred to as compromise. Which is the what the founding fathers had in mind for us all along.",1408406400,54,4042,4.846599131693198

6485979,5,B00LG7VWIA,"I don't care what anyone says about the author/producer of this film. He did a phenomenal job! D'Souza points out the great things America has done for the world, something you hear very little about in today's America (especially at the college level). I watched this film in theaters with my brother. He enjoyed it as much as I did, he's very liberal--communist type of guy.

Some Fun facts this film presented:

#1 Sarah Breedlove (December 23, 1867 - May 25, 1919), known as Madam C. J. Walker, was an American entrepreneur and philanthropist, regarded as the first female self-made millionaire in America. She was an African-American, which proves that despite racism and all, you can make it in America, if you believe in the American Dream.

#2 When Alexis de Tocqueville (French political thinker, historian best known for his works Democracy in America) visited America in the 1800s he noted: ""I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her commodious harbors and her ample rivers, and it was not there. I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her fertile fields and boundless forests, and it was not there. I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her rich mines and her vast world commerce, and it was not there. I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her public school system and her institutions of learning, and it was not there. I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her democratic Congress and her matchless Constitution, and it was not there. Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great because America is good, and if America ever ceases to be good America will cease to be great.""

#3 America is a nation that is unlike any other nation on earth, it offers the poor, downtrodden people of the world a chance that no country on this planet offers: hope for all, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, cultural background,etc.

BTW: I am a first-generation American who loves the US because I have personally experienced the American Dream.",1407283200,11,2137,4.780487804878049

6485982,1,B00LG7VWIA,"Dinesh D' Souza would not be deterred for another 100 minute rant against President Barack Obama and the Democrats before he serves his jail sentence later this year after he pleaded guilty of felony last May for the Federal campaign finance law violations he committed. The Ivy league graduate and Indian conservative immigrant who created 2016:Obama's America is at it again for the sake of the Republicans in the coming mid-term elections this coming November 2014. This time around,he has another political documentary entitled ""America:Imagine The World Without Her"" as he tries to entice the American audience by provoking their feelings of nationalism and patriotism with regards to what would it be like if the United States never existed and the things that the country has done wrong as a cover to his rant against liberalism.

D'Souza starts his documentary by presenting questions such as what would have happened to the United States if the George Washington was killed during the American Revolution against the British or if the country was divided after the Civil War during President Abraham Lincoln's time that would have created a country that is in a situation that is far worse off that what President Obama has brought the country into during his term as President of the United States. Interesting. That could have probably sparked some debate among the audience after watching this film. Some feelings of the love of the country would have been provoked. No question about it. But what sets this film up for failure right away is the expected bias that D'Souza will provide in favor of the Conservatives. He paints a picture that the country is headed towards that direction due to the failures of the current administration and if we continue to put our faith on the Democrats. It is just trying to say that Republicans have only done great things for the country and deserves all credit for making what the United States is as an economic power. We all know that isn't true. BOTH Democrats and Republicans have done GOOD and BAD THINGS for the country.

Then D'Souza proceeds into telling us about the conspiracy by academics and activists that have created a culture of ""shame"" about the history of the country. He mentions things that the Americans have stole Indian land,Mexican land,African slaves,global colonies and oil and that the capitalists are stealing from the Americans currently as it is allowed by the Administration. He sets out to dismiss each of those ""wrongdoings"" by blaming who else - the Liberals - for covering up the truth as he mentions Howard Zinn,who wrote a book about de-mythologizing American wrongdoings in history. Zinn happens to be an well-known leftist and a conservative like D'Souza makes him a great target.

D'Souza also whines about that the ""capitalists are under fire"" but fails to mention Wall Street's illegal activities .He also mentions about ""conquered lands"" especially when he complains that the Sioux Nation should refuse compensation given to them by the Americans and he also dismisses the notion of lingering impact of slavery on African- Americans,Vietnam fiasco and other events in American history. Too bad that as he mentions these issues,he addresses them through interviews with WELL-KNOWN CONSERVATIVES like Senator Ted Cruz,a potential presidential candidate,and RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGICAL HACKS that point out faults to the leftists instead of interviewing reputable academics and historians who are well-versed about the issues.

Overall,D'Souza is trying to teach us about American history to instigate conservatism instead of educating the viewers in this poorly researched and badly written documentary. Too bad that many people have given this a high rating due to the provocation of feelings of love for the country but fail to realize that they are being manipulated into admiring another third-rate documentary just like 2016:Obama's America,which is not based on facts but on promotion of D'Souza's biased thoughts on the issues being discussed,INTO EMBRACING CONSERVATISM or better yet voting for Republicans in the coming mid-term elections.",1407110400,6,4136,5.233785822021116

6485984,1,B00LG7VWIA,"This is a movie about D'Souza's personal divisive conservative views. It is very clear India has their own circumstances and history of imperialism. The use of common buzz words to describe historically accurate events but slanted to the movies point of view are very common. The movie lacks the basic premise of giving you the facts on both sides and letting you decide for yourself the answer that any credible documentary contains. Unless you do not have an advanced knowledge of world and US history it would be easy to fall into the trap of believing this outright propaganda. The underlying theme is that America is based on theft, and that all liberals are guilty of shaming America as an imperial thief. But this movie tries to place America above all other nations and uses obscure facts pieced together to fit the authors narrative and purpose. It would take a documentary three times as long to properly destroy every fact that supports the slanted view prescribed as fact in this movie and debunk every misled claim. The movie does one thing well and that is make D'Sousa more money. The purpose is pretty clear, have an opinion, then form your argument around it, ignore any fact that disagrees with your statements, use coded words to evoke emotion and interpret the facts for your audience to tell them how to feel. If you like this movie you already feel this way, that America is being destroyed by other people who are not like you and see things differently. The problem is America has always been full of all kinds of people, and there is nothing wrong in admitting Americans have done bad things and so have other members of other countries. America is NOT one view or one persons actions. America is a collection of all kinds of peoples and histories both good and bad, and this xenophobic view that somehow America is a view or one history that is either great or terrible is a false choice. A few people are not America, a few of their actions are not America, either good or bad. Finally, it is not a choice between good or bad, between socialism or capitalism, fascism or democracy, or a choice between two extremes this movie claims must be made, but is not reality. The entire movie is flawed, the answer has and always been somewhere in between. If you want to get upset over the mainstream media and liberals save your money and watch 2 hours worth of Fox news, but this movie and Fox are equally a waste of your time.",1406937600,32,2448,4.604118993135011

It is a two hour rant by a convicted felon and wing nut who can not stop accusing Obama of being a socialist who had the evil intention of taking over American  banks. ( Hey , wasn't ""TARP "" started by GWB? YES!!! )  This guy  also has the nerve to ridicule historian Howard Zinn because he mentions the parts of U.S.  history that are unflattering  , such as the treatment of  the Indians in the Trail of Tears. Perhaps he thinks Zinn should only write books that spin stories about America that leave out things like slavery . But hey, isn't it the job of a historian to tell the whole story , which is the TRUE story ?

  Di Souza is  a nerdy and not telegenic narcissist who can not stay  away from the camera , as he made himself the focus of almost all of the shots in the film.
  Accusing Obama of being a socialist who wanted the government to seize banks is absurd, considering the fact that the greedy profiteer bankers had their A$$e$ in a sling because of their own shady and sloppy practices. Di Souza fails to mention that the loans were repaid and the U. S . government made a profit !

 It is this kind of misleading slander that has cost the Republican party to lose people ( Like ME ) who are capable of fact checking .
Since they have no helpful ideas for the 99 %  of Americans, they attempt to retain power by scurrilous accusations  to their followers who often believe anything .

Leftist claims of Capitalistic abuse by the U.S. here at home and abroad are better understood by American exceptionalism in breaking down the age-old premise of amassing wealth, property, and ownership by those that fight wars to conquer neighboring countries and tribes. You will learn of white slavery which preceded the enslavement of black Africans in the U.S. You will learn that among the first millionaires in U.S. was an entrepreneurial Black woman who fulfilled the American dream and lifted herself out of the cotton fields because she hope and vision. You'll learn that some of the most vicious slave owners in the United States were free, Black plantation owners. America is exceptional because slavery was abolished in the USA, while it still flourishes in much of the rest of the world. Native American Indians cry ""Foul!"" but they abused other tribes across the country to gain their land. Conquer, or be conquered is no longer the law of the land in the United States.

6485996,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Very frequently, we find that some of the greatest Americans are people who were not born here. Dinesh D'Souza is one of them.

In yet another brilliantly executed and thoroughly researched documentary film, Mr. D'Souza has really moved us with his precise perspective on America's TRUE place in the world.

This is not just another flag-waving, star-spangled patriot film illuminated by the rocket's red glare...
It is so much more.

Mr. D'Souza interviewed a handful of leftist garbage who hate our nation, and asked them WHY they hate America so much. In this regard, nothing surpised me.

There was a brief time in my youth when I believed at least some of the vitriolic propaganda that these characters spew forth. This was largely a result of my exposure to public schools and so-called ""popular"" culture. However, not being one to merely believe what I was told to believe, ...I went to the library and did my own research.

I read the biographies of many of these prominent lefto activists, ""revolutionaries"", and self-designated ""progressive authorities""...

 What I discoverd was that absolutely none of these ""exalted"" ideologues was anyone who ever did even a minor bit of good in their pathetic lives. Characters such as noam chomsky, howard zinn, and saul alinsky devoted their lives to trashing the nation that gave them EVERYTHING. They spent every ounce of energy in spreading their lies, deceptions, and slander to poison the minds of vast hoardes of vapid, empty-headed youths that have also failed to contribute anything of worth. Most of these sheep-like followers are well ensconced in lives of full-blown criminality and degeneracy, in true emulation of their mentors and idols.

I attended a number of prominent leftist organizations and groups on campus as a student. I did this out of curiosity: ""Whats it REALLY about?""
...I did not like the type of people I saw there, or what they had to say. That is the summary of my rejection of so-called ""liberalism/progressivism"" ideology.

In this great film Mr. D'Souza artfully clarifes the nature of five common lies, and intent of the liars, with easily verified historical truth. The result is a glorious portrayal of a great nation that REALLY IS the best hope for so much of the world. A sampling of the falsehoods which Mr. D'Souza confronts in this movie:

-America was built on land ""stolen"" from the indigenous people?

-I studied those indigenous cultures in great detail, emphasizing as much as possible actual native narratives. The native tribes on this continent experienced a great deal of movement, as one tribe conquered, enslaved, absorbed, anihilated, or displaced another. Most of these tribes were engaged in constant wilderness-warfare from the time that the glaciers thawed at the end of the Ice Age. There is plenty of evidence in the archeological record. The indigenous-narrators and outside observers have quite graphically attested to the rampant atrocities that they did in fact inflict upon each other, quite gratuitously...
""First Nations?"" ...WHAT ""nations""?
There were SO FEW people on the continent of North America, that most of the explorers of European origin were overwhelmed by the vast emptiness and lack of human habitation.
...There are MORE people living in New York City NOW, ...than the WHOLE population of North America in the year 1500!

-America is an ""inherantly racist"" state, that was ""built"" on the labor of slaves?

-MORE people died fighting a war to END SLAVERY in America, ...than the numbers of those who have died fighting every other war in our nation's history!
_If America is ""so racist"", ...why have we seen MORE Africans WILLINGLY immigrating to America than the numbers of those Africans who were forcibly brought here as slaves? ...By the way, those slaves were purchased FROM OTHER AFRICANS.
-If America ""owes reparations"" to the descendants of African slaves, ...does America owe reparations to the FAR GREATER NUMBER of Irish, Scots, Welsh, and English people who were brought to America by force to be slaves?

_America ""stole"" land from Mexico?

_NO! America took that land as part of an AGREED TREATY with Mexico. They started the war, America WON. We raised the Stars and Stripes over Mexico City after a sharp fight, ...and they surrendered. They complied with the sacrifice of territory, ...and America actually made a GREAT NATION from it!

-On the subject of Mexico:
-Why does no one ever accuse Mexico of ""stealing land"" from the Indians?
-Why does no one ever acknowledge the CONTINUING opression and harassment that the government of Mexico STILL inflicts on its own indigenous natives? There is at least 500 years of enslavement and INTENTIONAL slaughter of the native people inside Mexico's borders that spans not only the period in which Mexico was a colony of Spain, ...but up to the present in the history of post-colonial Mexico. As an active-duty U.S. Marine, I knew several Mexican-nationals serving in the United States Marine Corps and Navy who personally witnessed or even experienced this. So once again, ...if America is really such a reprehensible nation, ...why are so many Mexicans so desperate as to break the law in order to get here?

Finally, Mr. D'Souza sounds the alarm that we are under threat by a government that is increasingly acting aggressively against the citizens whom it is SUPPOSED TO SERVE.

I wish he would have gone into further detail on this very serious development. We have an ever-expanding police-state that has militarized all manner of federal agencies with: armored vehicles, ballistic-armor and automatic-weapons for its agents, and an ever-growing supply of ammunition.

In fact, its ammunition that active-duty military personnel are PROHIBITED from using in battle(by international agreement).

WHY are they amassing this war-gear?
Why do such agencies as the Bureau of Land Management, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Education, just to name a few,  ...have sniper-teams and storm-troopers? Why all this surveillance of the law-abiding citizens by the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation?",1406160000,17,6121,5.1626262626262625

The fact that liberal movie critics uniformly hated it to such an irrational degree is evidence of the fact that it drew at least as much blood from them as ""Bowling for Columbine"" did with conservatives.

Second, because D'Souza is apparently incapable of focus or restraint, his film will persuade no one.

Had D'Souza made a straightforward documentary providing balancing historical facts to the self-hating American history narrative that has become prevalent in recent decades, that would have been enough.

Instead, when the film already seems a little unfocused and padded with too many romanticized historical reenactments and should be ending, D'Souza starts over with what seems like a second documentary.

It isn't that the additional information is of no importance or interest, but that he essentially destroys any progress he might have made by tacking on a 30 minute Democrat-bashing free-for-all.

It really gives them the truth and correct response to the false education our children are forced to agree with for fear of failure. Great scenes and reenactments as well as an uplifting Star Spangled Banner remake by Madison Rising that sent chills up my spine. Thank you Dinesh for restoring my hope that this country actually has a chance to survive as long as we have the truth to counter the progressive untruths.

6486015,5,B00LG7VWIA,"I saw this docudrama at the theater, and all in attendance were quiet until the end of the film and then applauded.  I won't repeat what other reviewers have said about the detail and interviews Dinesh D'Souza used in making this docudrama, although it was done with completeness and a deep respect for our founding fathers and the principles our country were built upon.  In my opinion, we as Americans are lucky to have Dinesh D'Souza to make such a film who put much time and energy into this visually stunning historical docudrama that is both educational and a celebration of independence and hard work of individuals who lived in this great country long before us and their achievements to build their own lives including the story of Madame C.J. Walker, a historically noted female entrepreneur.  There is much to glean from this patriotic docudrama.  It is a film to be enjoyed again and again.",1405555200,26,902,4.8
6486016,3,B00LG7VWIA,"Like Dinesh DSouza I am an immigrant and I have lived in America for 27 years.

I disagree with maybe 60% of what DSouza has to say, agree with maybe 40%.

He cherry picks many of his examples. He comes across as a conservative Michael Moore (who is annoying to many liberals).

I could analyze many points but, as an example, let us look at the American Indians issue. It is probably true that most died of disease not warfare and that calling their fate genocide may be a stretch. But DSouza does not mention Wounded Knee, Sand Creek massacre, colonel Chivington destroying crops to starve the Indians, extermination of buffalo herds for the same purpose, systematic actions of the whites to destroy Native Americans.

He does not mention that it was the Mexican government that invited the Anglo-Americans to Texas, the fact that would actually strengthen his argument. However, he glosses over the facts behind how New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and California were appropriated.

It is true that many borders were established as a result of war and conquest. This does not make war and conquest any more legitimate. The fact that the American Indian tribes fought between themselves does not make it OK to force people who lived on certain land for generations to move to Oklahoma.

Zbigniew Brzezinski (National Security Advisor in Carter administration) said that America has the potential to do BOTH good and bad things in the world, and had done both in the past. It has the potential to be the worlds leader or the worlds bully. Under Bush administration it had become more of the latter. I personally hope that the America can once again become the worlds leader.

I think that, overall, the documentary is thought-provoking. For, I think, a more balanced view I recommend my book on Amazon:
How to Improve America: Education, Immigration, Health Care, and more: Immigrant's Perspective:

6486017,5,B00LG7VWIA,"In addition to the comments by others, I was impressed with the interview with well known progressive Ward Churchill. Churchill stated his true beliefs in his own words. The connection between Saul Alinsky and Obama and Hillary was very insightful. If you are a conservative, libertarian, or a true republican you will like this movie. If you are a liberal/progressive you probably won't like what is in this movie. I wish this book/movie could be made available to all pubic schools and universities.",1405382400,29,501,5.048192771084337

It is going to join the film ""2016, Obama's America"" in my homeschool library to be used as a teaching aid because the information in this film is vitally important. I love my country, America, and I greatly appreciate that these things are being brought to light. Not only did my husband and I learn many things from this film, but we came away feeling ever so proud of, and even more grateful for this great country in which we are so privileged to live. Thank you Dinesh! Keep up the good work and may God bless you and yours.",1405382400,22,647,4.445378151260504
6486020,5,B00LG7VWIA,"""America"" is a love letter in film to freedom. Having seen the documentary twice, the prospect of getting the book simply is now irresistible since books invariably are superior to film.

If you haven't seen the film, don't miss it. If you have, don't miss reading the book. {Finished and reviewed book.}

Well done, Mr. D'Souza, from one American Christian to another.

6486021,5,B00LG7VWIA,"I saw this movie on a Saturday afternoon, and by the end I looked around the theater which contained about a dozen seniors and thought to myself, this theater should be filled to capacity with young people who are taken in by today's liberal rhetoric. They have no idea how great America was and could be again with the right leadership. The current administration has marched us down a path to total destruction, but like the author, I have hope things could turn around.

I cried at the end with pride for my country and also for the apparent demise of our constitution.",1405209600,30,572,4.553398058252427

And it NEVER got back to that promise.) I found it to be full of political nonsense, misinformation, and half truths. Worse it wandered all over the place, not even trying to stick to a line, or group, of points. It was obvious that the people behind the movie were Republicans, or anti-Americans. It did have some interest historical 'facts', if true, but their accuracy is questionable due to everything else in the movie. I wanted my money, and time, back after I watched this collection. 1 star is too generous, zero, or better yet negative stars, is closer to the truth. This is the worst thing I've watched in years; hopefully it will be the worst thing I ever watch!",1405123200,34,844,4.416666666666667
6486023,5,B00LG7VWIA,"My husband and I drove 200 miles yesterday to see this movie (and eat at a good oriental restaurant). We read before seeing it that Peter Sobczynski, reviewing this movie on ""RogerEbert.com"", says ""it plods along with all the verve of a PowerPoint presentation."" Well, since the purpose of this movie is to educate and inform, that really wouldn't be such a bad thing. Fortunately, Mr. Sobczynski is wrong. It is incredibly interesting and well-designed as an educational tool. Those who watch it will understand and remember the main points, which is the goal of a real educator. The movie contains several well-documented, but hitherto hidden, historical facts, such as the number of BLACK slave owners who supported the confederacy; the story of Madam C. J. Walker, who, in 1914, became America's first female millionaire by virtue of her hard work, rather than her color (black) and her birthright (slavery); and how Saul Alinski, who dedicated ""Rules for Radicals"" to Lucifer because he was the first radical, studied, admired, and learned tactics from Frank Nitti (Al Capone's second-in-command), became an example that Barack Obama followed, and impressed Hillary Clinton so much she did her thesis on him.

It is a movie for all of us to see if we love this country and want to save her as the land of the free, and not become the home of the (socialist) slave.  It is a reminder of how we came to be, why we came to be, and who we are today.  We are not imperialists; we do not capture lands belonging to others.  We are in debt that will be very difficult to erase, and we have no future to offer the next generation of retirees now.  We must work to rid ourselves of debt, encourage entrepreneurship, and protect our assets by protecting our borders, and the movie reminds us that although we all came as immigrants, it must be done the right way.  We are not conquistadors, but settlers.  We don't take the lands of those whom we  defeat, we rebuild their countries for them.

This was a revolutionary idea, no society had ever done this before. They created our founding documents to preserve this idea that people have inherent rights and government is there to protect these rights. America is under attack and we are losing our freedoms. Seeing this movie will help people see some of the ways that it is being attacked and whether these attacks are justified or accurate.

6486027,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Finally someone tackles of a few of the most common lies, repeated over and over in the media and the schools that bash the very soul of America and the core of its identity. The dramatizations and emotional appeals won't sway the liberals, but if they are open minded and curious they can verify and follow up on the factual hints. But this movie isn't for them, its to rally the disheartened loyal remnant of true Americans tired of watching America decline.

The Bono speech ""America is an idea"" was key. If you want to save America from its decline, this battle isn't on some far away beach, its in the schools, media, and culture here at home. Its a battle of ideas and the anti-Americans are winning by preventing alternative views from even appearing to be discussed. Alternative ideas are shut down by Alinsky tactics and that's why Alinksy is a key point in the film also. Dinesh just hinted at the depth of the corruption in our politics, but you can only go so far on what the people are prepared to accept. In the end, Dinesh admits we have no Lincolns, no Washington's, no great leaders to lead us today from our crises. Its up to each of us, that's all there is.

6486029,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Let me start by saying that I don't agree with what D'Souza did with campaign funds; he openly admits in the film that he made a mistake and that he's not above the law. I judge a work by the content, not the person making it. At least he's owning up to it, something that many in Washington sadly will not do. It's unfortunate but don't let that color your perception of America: Imagine a World Without Her. This film is a true testament to the strength and ingenuity of America.

The film is solid in that it investigates most of the America-shaming that seems to be all the rage these days. He looks at the charges of genocide, racism, inequality and plunder that many even in our own country are tossing around. Simply put: he does a magnificent job of refuting every single one of them with historical records, interviews and speeches given during the time period. Every left wing and radical talking point is deconstructed without ever coming off as condescending or arrogant. I think D'Souza has a gift for at least being able to listen to someone else's side of an argument, even if he doesn't agree with it. To his credit he is pretty fair to everyone involved and admits where America has made mistakes or where we've taken our freedom for granted. He looks at people like Madam Walker, the first black millionaire who started from the bottom and worked her way up. He documents how Native Americans killed each other and conquered others' land long before Columbus ever came here and the number of blacks who owned slaves. He contends that America is different because we build and innovate through hard work and a love of freedom, something I can agree with. Capitalism and hard work provide a life that no other system can lay claim to. It's hard not to be moved and to feel a sense of pride at how far our country has come and also how far we've allowed our government to wreck it.

It's not quite as focused as 2016 but it's far more expansive and interesting because it's covering the history of our nation, rather than focusing on one solitary politician. Liberals will undoubtably hate it and will most likely not give it a watch, either because they're afraid of having their agenda challenged or because they have preconceived notions of what it will be. He doesn't encourage anyone to vote for any particular politician or party but rather asks them to examine our country and see if our power and success is truly warranted. I believe it is and the question of how people can hate a nation that has given them so much may never be answered...but I'm sure glad someone's willing to keep asking.",1404604800,48,2616,4.575692963752665
6486030,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Ever wonder why the Liberal professors never talk about Madam Walker (the first self-made female millionaire who happens to be black), the blacks who owned slaves, the Native-Americans who took land from other Native-Americans or the white slaves? America: Imagine a World Without Her examines these topics and many more. It starts with all the assertions that have been made about American imperialism and refutes each point.

6486032,3,B00LG7VWIA,"The power of the film medium--for good and evil--is well recognized and demonstrated. The medium's politically tinged offerings usually bypass the intellect and appeal directly to the emotions.

 Mr. D'Souza's new movie combines natural emotional appeals with demands on our reason. His aim is to confute the hate-filled claims of the political left which attack America and her people. Mr. D'Souza's task is daunting because it is a complex story examining history and political theory.

Happily, Mr. D'Souza succeeds in providing all Americans with a film which not only entertains while it educates; the film also has an edifying effect.

However, there are two flaws which render his message less effective than it could be:

1. His narrative should have included a couple more sentences in each of the sections relating to the war with Mexico, and the discussion of Capitalism;

2. Far more serious is his failure to offer any sort of solution to the present depraved political state. D'Souza's parting words to us merely assert that we Americans will not allow our rights to be taken.

Understandably, Mr. D'Souza (or, any writer who actively resists the criminality in the existing Federal government) must be circumspect in his political expression. But, his filmic epilogue should have at least included the milestone years 1776 and 1860 as relevant to our present circumstances. He did precisely that in his book, America.

6486034,5,B00LG7VWIA,"Dinesh explains one angle of the why and how America is being brought down -  because of national self-suicide and national refusal of We The People to defend uniquely American ideals. The primary tool of those engendering the self-suicide is distorted information to produce national shame. Dinesh identifies just a few of the most common and most potent arguments of national political shame taught in the classroom, mainstream  media and even churches today. Then he provides a conceptual counter answer coupled with a specific counter facts and a historical personality. He paints in broad strokes and will not convince or undo years of school indoctrination in the closed minded, but he gives enough to the open minded to question the dominant paradigm.

I was moved to tears several times because I know we are in fight of ideals and ideologies, and much that I love and value has been injured and is in grave danger.  Despite what Dinesh did not do and did not cover, he did do more to open political debate and awareness in a broad way in a few hours than the prior decades of mainstream movie making. Michael Moore was never this balanced (not saying Dinesh is balanced) nor did Michael Moore achieve this level of honesty or really even break new ground as Dinesh is doing in exposing ideological roots. We are in an idealogical war now, but in the end there is hope. This movie is part of that hope. But we have no great national leaders today, so its up to us, each of us individually, to fight as if the outcome does depend on us since it may.
