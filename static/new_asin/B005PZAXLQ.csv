8482792,4,B005PZAXLQ,What a great glimpse of some of Chicagos' landmarks. I watch this in the background while puttering around the house...amazed that each time I notice some new detail. The static camera angles makes this like looking out a window on to the Windy City. Have watched it regularly and never tire of this city views. Wants me to go back to Chicago.,1330560000,,343,4.548387096774194
8482793,1,B005PZAXLQ,"This DVD is not a tour of Chicago at all ... this is simply a camera set in a few places around the city and watching the activity ... I believed that this DVD would be a tour and show the many exciting places in Chicago ... but it is far from that ... save your money, the picture on the cover is the best part of the DVD",1330214400,3,322,3.681159420289855
8482794,1,B005PZAXLQ,This is amateur video.  Someone set up a camera on a tripod and let it run for 5 or 10 minutes at each Chicago site. Not even any good transitions. Boring! It would have been more interesting if they just used still pictures and created a slide show. Don't waste your money on this one.,1327276800,,286,4.2
