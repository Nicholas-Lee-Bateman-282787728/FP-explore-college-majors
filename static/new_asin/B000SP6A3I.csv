8206212,5,B000SP6A3I,"This is an excellent film which I had seen some time ago on a premium movie channel. It showed up again several months ago and I decided to add it to my personal collection. It's a ""coming of age"" story that takes place in a very small town 100KM from Buenos Aires. The mostly young cast are believable in their characters an do an excellent job. Anyone who has every lived in a dusty, boring, small town and has had dreams that there is something more to experience out there in the world-at-large will enjoy this charming film very much.",1522713600,,539,4.4
8206213,5,B000SP6A3I,Excellent coming of age film in the genre of Stand by Me.  The characters are real-life examples of the struggles many face growing up in whatever culture.,1346457600,,155,4.7407407407407405
8206214,2,B000SP6A3I,"Strand Releasing should be barred from releasing any more movies. They really don't care about the movies they've got in their stock as there have always been no special features, always burnt-in subtitles, always non-anamorphic widescreen, always low bitrate picture. Why bother stay in the DVD business anyway, let alone foreign movie DVD business?

This movie once again proves those abovementioned points: 2.72GB of data, non-anamorphic, no extras. Yet it has a price tag of $24.99 SRP. This is called SHAMELESSNESS.",1189641600,7,520,5.419753086419753
