5116110,3,B0080QOL10,"Great service it really was; but the movies, oh not so good very slow and boring. I was disapointed and had hoped for better.",1353888000,3,125,4.25
5116111,3,B0080QOL10,"This was not exactly what I thought it would be.
I bought this DVD because I like ""things British"", but when I looked at the movies, I realized that what I really like is ""old British"" and not the modern British things....",1353369600,4,222,4.309523809523809
5116112,5,B0080QOL10,"If you enjoy all things English, not to mention Colin Firth, you will love this DVD. Not to mention the other great stories, not headlined by Mr. Firth.",1353283200,12,152,4.464285714285714
5116113,5,B0080QOL10,You certainly get your moneys worth with this collection.  All the movies were well executed and entertaining.  I particularly like British movies because they are much longer than American movies.  They also have less vulgarity as a rule.  Definitely worth every penny.,1352505600,153,270,5.357142857142857
5116114,4,B0080QOL10,"All but two of these eight are movies I'd seen on the big screen years ago.  Four I'd liked well enough to know I'd want to see them again from time to time--especially Oscar Wilde's ""An Ideal Husband,"" if only for Rupert Everett's hilarious performance.  Also Judi Dench as Queen Victoria in ""Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown"" and Vanessa Redgrave's middle-aged war with a very young  Uma Thurman for the affections of Edward Fox in ""A Month by the Lake"", and  ""My Life So Far,"" based on Sir Denis Forman's memoir of his Scottish childhood*, with Colin Firth as his roving-eyed father.

The two I didn't much like the first time I saw them I liked even less the second time. (""Restoration""  with Robert Downey Jr. and ""The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain"" with Hugh Grant) but I suspect that's a minority viewpoint.

The two I was seeing here for the first time made this purchase well worth the buy all on their own.  ""Sweet Revenge"" with Helena Bonham Carter, Sam Neill and Kristin Scott Thomas is an absolute hoot and I can't believe I'd never heard of it.  ""Tom and Viv"" with Willem Dafoe  and Miranda Richardson tells the sad story of  author T. S. Eliot's  angst-ridden first marriage, back in the days when women with ""female"" problems were diagnosed as mentally ill and carted off to the looney bin.

There are no extras--no subtitles, no closed-captioning, no scene indexes. Also,  the product info above gives the impression that Gerard Butler is Dench's co-star in ""Mrs. Brown."" Not so. Dench's co-star is Billy Connolly. Butler plays a  supporting role as Connolly's brother.

*Seeing ""My Life So Far"" again reminded me how very much I've loved the book it's based on,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-Adam/dp/0708849903/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of Adam</a>, now also sold under the title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life-So-Far/dp/0349110271/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life So Far</a>.

Addenda 12/31/12: Also, Firth fans please note that, despite his dominance on the cover of this set, he is in only one of these 8 movies and, like all the adult roles in it, plays a supporting role to the wonderful child actor Robert Norman who plays the lead.",1351123200,685,2565,5.486005089058525

Most of the movies are grainy and not HD and out of focus
The worst thing is that there is no option to add closed captioning - this is especially important for elderly folks whose hearing may not be great, but also useful for people who need some assistance understanding the British accent.
The volume level in some of the films is also very low - when played at maximum volume on the TV, the sound volume remains low.
This is a very cheap DVD containing 8 great films, but the price of the DVD reflects the quality - POOR.  I do not recommend that you purchase this DVD if any of the above criticisms are of relevance to you.",1483488000,14,706,4.229629629629629

DVDs come in and out of print and even out of print there has to be some good prices somewhere. 8 Acclaimed (British) Films is clearly for fans of modern British movies, esp then up and commers like Collin Firth and  Hugh grant as well as grand dames like Judy Dench and Vanessa Redgrave. No Jane Austin here but much in the way of literary refinances and history costume dramas. These are not something for everybody movies. You much like intelligent dialoged and subtlety and slower pacing. Evan the lessor of the movies here have fine performances and superior costuming and some amazing beautiful settings. Where they fail it is directing.
<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D<D

I'll not review all 8 movies in this set but I will comment as to what struck me about most of them

To start with the low moment. Tom and Viv is a film biopic of TS Elliot and his failed first marriage with the well-connected Vivian. William Defoe gives us a highly intense TS Elliot, by mostly never saying , doing or emoting. This is one seriously DULL poet. There are huge gaps in the narrative and we never know how much the marriage failed for lack of hormone treatments of because well the British Aristocracy had no ability to cope with metal derangement among their own.

Restoration has its moments, and both Meg Ryan and Robert Downy Jr perform ably enough. After one or two surprises early in the movie the rest is too nearly predictable. Not a bad movie, just not as interesting as the costumes and scenery.

THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN is a fun enough movie mostly a true story and Hugh Grant being Hugh Grant except before we knew his  bumbling charm is his acting trademark.

A MONTH BY THE LAKE is the almost mandatory almost chick flick about older people falling in love. Charming and Redgrave is marvelous.
I almost came to hate My Life So Far, but the last ten seconds of the movie are save it. It is also a biopic, but these people are more likable.

Sweet Revenge is the English version of Throw Momma Off the Train, less brash and just as pleasingly silly Helena Bonham Carter is as crazy as she usually is only funnier. Still I missed Ann Ramsey.

There is no reason for you to be reading any of this if these topics and this generation of British film making is not your cuppa tea. 8 Acclaimed Films has enough quality movie time here for most of the people who have chosen to read this far. Find a copy at a cost you can accept and plan on at least 650 of 800 minutes to be good movie watching, all with fine acting and beautiful things to look at.",1445385600,5,2616,4.467505241090147

I am super tired of the idiocy that seems to be contemporary Hollywood - at least those that make the headlines.  I find pleasure in the different approach to life that seems typical of the best of British drama.  And, I love having them at my fingertips of an afternoon or evening when nothing but mindless drivel is to be found on any of the myriad television channels that seem unable to do anything meaningful with any degree of consistency.  Watching these films at home and in comfort at a reasonable price is, for me, a pleasant and affordable escape from the movie house crowd.

And...""Empty thoughts and nothings are the only thing I know something about.""  Both lines spoken by Rupert Everett as Arthur, London's eligible, rich and handsome bachelor.  How do the Brits make something out of virtually nothing?  Well, these films do that, delighting the viewer in the process, taking him or her into a distant land where cherished values enable an heiress to plan murders, the grieving Queen Victoria to take a servant as a lover then squash him, a young Colin Firth, a younger Hugh Grant who offends a Welsh town by declaring their mountain a hill, a sexy French aunt arrives to open the eyes of her 12 year old charge, and a depressed businessman teams with a quirky aristocrat to plot retaliation against those who drove them to the edge.  Gentle, deeply typical of our human foibles, twisty plots, and clever scripts make for worthwhile viewing.",1394755200,,1046,4.948571428571428

5116435,4,B0080QOL10,"Bought it because had hoped to see a lot of Colin Firth. Turns out, he's probably featured on the cover because he'll sell the most copies, but is only in a late, minor, family film.  However all the casts are composed of different, excellent, well-known British actors, who play well in ensemble. Vanessa Redgrave is particularly gorgeous in A MONTH BY THE LAKE. Many are PG but don't let the children near TOM & VIV, an excellent but often violent depiction of ""T.S.Eliot's turbulent relationship with his first wife""; a realistic, unsettling evocation of her mental Illness.",1389398400,,577,4.948453608247423

(Not that Hollywood isn't great, it totally is)

The only one I've actually watched so far is The Englishman who went up a hill and down a mountain, and it's cute and quirky and funny and just what I expected. (That was a lot of adjectives, I apologize.)

5116488,4,B0080QOL10,"Would be perfect if I hadn't already seen a couple of the movies, but no big deal--will just rewatch them.
Bought to have along for vacation evenings in our room on a longer trip. (Saves running out for rentals or purchasing expensive in-room movies.) Not all the best movies in British history, but perfectly adequate for the price & situation.",1380758400,,345,4.766666666666667

5116499,4,B0080QOL10,I enjoyed this collection better than the rest I ordered.  Better stories to begin with I think.  Three more words required.,1378339200,,124,4.857142857142857

5116502,3,B0080QOL10,"I have come to expect much more from British film. Had I not previously seen two of the films I may have never ordered this. Without a doubt re-seeing ""Mrs Brown"" was an extremely enjoyable film... however, most of the others were borderline smut and very much not what I would have expected. Quality and subject matter were in very poor taste.",1377907200,,344,4.564516129032258

5116514,1,B0080QOL10,"The picture quality on these movies is horrible. They are really grainy. One movie has subtitles and on my 52"" screen I still can't read the writing because of the poor quality. I would never buy this again no matter what this price. Not worth it!",1376092800,10,247,4.391304347826087

5116528,1,B0080QOL10,Very low resolution video to disk copy.  Destroys all enjoyment of the films.  Difficult to understand why the studios would allow such trash to be put on the market.  Don't waste your money!,1373587200,7,191,4.7272727272727275
5116529,5,B0080QOL10,I got this as 3 of the movies have actors I like. But done as British humor and movies there is some nudity but over all seem good movies. The quality of the recordings is good. Have watched 3 of the 8 so far.,1373241600,,209,3.772727272727273

5116534,3,B0080QOL10,Is it true?  Makes a sad story.  Loved Dame Judy Dench.  She is able to stretch our emotions - duty and personal life push the bounds.  I am saving the other 7 for winter viewing.,1372636800,,179,4.0285714285714285
5116535,4,B0080QOL10,"This is really nice collection of things many may not have seen. These are the kinds of films that would be list by the video store as manager's picks. The kind you might otherwise never hear of. A great value, too with 8 films total.",1372550400,,234,4.222222222222222

5116549,5,B0080QOL10,"Restoration is a movie of hope although I was surprised to see Hugh Grant as a villain. Robert Downey evolved his character into a mature, compassionate person to the amazement of the King.

The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain was so funny and Hugh Grant as usual.  It is amazing no matter how science can prove hill is not a mountain those who believe in the mountain tried to make it so.

My fav - An Ideal Husband.  Although I love Jeremy Northam you have to admit the interaction between Minnie Drive and Rupert Everett was fun to watch.  In the middle of all the misunderstandings and intrigue, these two find a way to co-exist.

Sweet Revenge was way too out there but it was a little humorous while being dastardly.  I enjoy watching Helena Bonham Carter but it took some time to get into the movie because of her outlandishness.

Dame Judi Dench is a marvelous actress and this movie, ""Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown"", was so spectacular.  There are times in our life when we need a friend, not just tea, sympathy and a pat on the head.  No matter if you are a queen or horseman, there are times that try your very reason for living.  Judi Dench was absolutely real and marvelous in her role of Queen Victoria.

T.S Eliot is a favorite poet.  Tom & Viv was masterfully portrayed and so realistic that I felt that I really had a peek at what they must have been going through.  I have a renewed interest in re-reading works of T.S. Eliot because of his love and the dedication of his life to her.  I am sure you will have an interest in his works as well.

I have mentioned my favorites on the DVD, but they were all well worth watching over and over again.",1370131200,4,1680,4.302547770700637

5116557,5,B0080QOL10,"Warm-hearted, uplifting and very entertaining stories in a lovely compilation of well cast films. Except, the flimsy, poorly cast and acted ""A Month By The Lake"". It was hard to watch two miscast actors playing ""over-the-hill"" adults who behave worse than pre-pubescent teens. The writing, directing & acting totally missed the mark on the ""mid-life"" crisis issue? The scenery on Lake Como is nice though! Skip this one, but the rest are extremely palatable and true keepers for the British film lovers library of favorites.",1368921600,,524,5.176470588235294
5116558,5,B0080QOL10,"The couple of winners in this movie collection make it more than worth while.  Right now so friends have borrowed the collection so I have to review it by memory that is at least 3 months old (and at my age, 60's, that's sort of difficult).  I particularly enjoyed the Mr. Brown and the Queen, as well as The Men Who Climbed Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain (sic?).  Great British dry humor.  The Robert Downey Jr. movie about repentance or atonement  was the worst to me although the visual effects of British royalty and the costuming was really worth watching; so even my least enjoyable movie in the collection was still ok.",1368316800,,630,4.443478260869565

The one about the mountain nearly comes off but most of the critics at the time said that the subject just isn't that interesting, which really means the film's long and boring.

The 8 features are all films that first showed from 1994 to 1999. Each is 90 to 118 minutes and all are in widescreen and color. They are loaded with star performers in stellar accomplishments. It is a satisfying mix of comedy, historical drama, romance, and biography. What more can you say except the price is less than renting. And you will want to watch some of the offerings more than once. They are as good as any of the new cinema creations put out today.

Restoration: Robert Downey Jr, Meg Ryan, Ian MacKellan, Hugh Grant, and more. London 1663 drama of one mans journey through the light and dark of the period times. R rating for sexuality, nudity. One of the best.

An Ideal Husband: A delightful period drama/romance with stellar performances by Minnie Driver & Cate Blanchett. Another of my favorite from this lot.

A Month by the Lake: An older (Vanessa Redgrave) lady finds romance in a wonderful adaptation of a story by HE Bates.

My Life So Far: Scot lad Fraser lives a somewhat wild childhood and viewers get a very funny accounting of his coming to terms with puberty. Colin Firth is the dad. I'll watch this film again and again.

The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a Mountain. What will Welsh townsfolk do to retaliate against surveyors (Ian McNeice, Hugh Grant) claiming their prized local mountain is less than 1000 feet--thus a mere `hill'? Another top winner.

Sweet Revenge: 2 souls fail to complete suicides off London's Tower Bridge. They form a pact to play a deadly game of revenge against those that drove them to the brink. Lots of UK stars.

Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown: Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) gets close and personal during her grief from losing the King with Mr. Brown, a man who cares for her horses and the emotional state of his queen. True love?

Tom & Viv: A very accurate & well done fictional/biographic look a the life of T.S. Eliot (Willem Dafoe), poet with an insane wife.

NO SUBTITLES OR Closed Caption--shame on ECHO BRIDGE. No bonus stuff.

I have traveled to UK enough to know that the British people are generally quite polite, polished, reserved, and mannered. With the exception of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down A Mountain (the only redeeming film in this collection; Hugh Grant portrays the real British style well) the makers of the other 7 have obviously visited Hollywood too many times and have drunk their Kool-Aid. The courseness, vulgarity, even offensiveness in dumbed-down run-on dialogue, babbling idiotic nonsense, and lack of plausible plot is not up to the usual British polish.

By the way, my favorite is ""An Ideal Husband."" Excellent cast, and very interesting plot.

Also really like ""Sweet Revenge."" I think it's an odd comedy, but very funny and kind of touching.

I like ""A Month by the Lake,"" but would like it much more if the picture weren't so blurry -- the landscapes and cinematography are breathtaking...what a shame it's out of focus. Good romantic plot as well.

""My Life So Far"" with Colin Firth was very good...I would describe it as a bittersweet story about marriage, with a happy ending...presented through the point of view of a child who has a crush on an older woman.

Couldn't get into ""The Englishman Who Climbed a Mountain."" Though Hugh Grant is one of my favorite actors of all time, the subject matter just seemed trivial and silly.

""Restoration"" was just too bawdy for me...within just the first 5 minutes of the film, you see Robert Downey Jr. getting it on most energetically with some tart and I'm just not into that kind of film.

Couldn't get into Tom & Viv either for some reason.

5116709,2,B0080QOL10,"When you see a movie collection with Colin Firth, Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett on the front cover (plus Hugh Grant, Jeremy Northam, etc.), you just assume it will be good. Well, it isn't. It's marketing. I already owned an Ideal Husband (on VHS) so saw it was in this DVD collection and assumed the other films would be similar quality. They are not. I own almost every Jane Austen and period movie ever made and love that genre and usually love British cinema, BBC, etc.; however, the only good films out of this 8-movie collection are An Ideal Husband (excellent, 4.5 stars, really fun movie about politics, love, forgiveness, second chances, etc.) and Her Majesty Mrs. Brown (3.5 stars) about Queen Victoria mourning her husband's loss and the Scottish servant who helps her move past her loss. I also found Restoration very moving/poignant. However, I couldn't even get through the rest of the films -- A Month by the Lake was incredibly boring and pointless with Vanessa Redgrave as an older lady chasing an older man who was flirting with a young nanny (Uma Thurman) and the same basic thing kept happening over and over again -- I had to force myself to watch it. My Life So Far was crass, with an awful performance by Colin Firth as a second-rate, eccentric husband flirting with his brother's wife while his young son looks at naked lady pictures. The Englishman who went up the Hill is okay (3 stars) as it's kind of interesting that a town would put dirt on a hill so it gets taller and can be called a mountain, but most of these movies aren't even the kind I would watch if they were on TV (definitely wouldn't buy or watch again). I haven't watched the others yet -- Sweet Revenge or Tom & VIV, so maybe one of those will be good but I'm not expecting much. So far, only 3 of the 8 were worth having. At the price, it's worth buying the set only for An Ideal Husband and Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown (plus Restoration was good) unless you can get An Ideal Husband by itself for less.

x A Month By The Lake: Awkward Vanessa Redgrave & giraffe-like Uma Thurman on Lake Como Italy by Switzerland. Lavender ladies might like.

x Tom & Viv: Depressing true story of female writer T.S. Eliot's hormonal insanity oddly wed to rawboned American Anglophile William Defoe.

x My Life So Far: Decadent ""true"" story produced by Harvey Weinstein (need I say more?) that not even a beautiful Scottish castle and the oddly cast Italian-American actress I like--Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio--could redeem

x Sweet Revenge: ""Clockwork Orange"" sociopath/psychopath soulless weirdos trying to be funny. Helena Bonham Carter & Sam Neill)
