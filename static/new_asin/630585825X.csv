""A Customer"" reviewed this selection like it's historical fiction.  It's not.  This stuff really happened.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" did not.

7896397,5,630585825X,"I prefer books and movies that give me a chance to learn about the soldiers that fought for our country.  The Medal of Honor stories gave me a very brief, but important look at those who fought for my freedom.  The personal accounts are very well done.  I believe all would like to hear the story of each medal of honor recipient.",1021939200,3,330,4.290322580645161
