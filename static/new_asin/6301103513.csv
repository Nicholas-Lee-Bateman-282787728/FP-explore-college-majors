321358,4,6301103513,"(With no pun intended in relation to the lesser, copy-cat brain-eating zombies of the ""Return of..."" series)George Romero should be remembered as the man who brought us the Cerebral-Zombie-pic. Not satisfied with simple horror mayham and gore, he has layered a heavy dose of editorial commentary on human nature - much to the amusement of misanthropes everywhere. Through his ""it's our own damn fault"" subplots, we see that this classic trilogy fits in less with the ""gory/horror/slasher"" genre, and perhaps finds itself more at home catorgorized as an updated Ray Bradbury or George Orwell piece.
  Unfortunately, his subtly in displaying his message has wained with each movie. In ""Night ..."" the occassional news report and the internal bickering were omnipresent, and yet were not overemphasised. In ""Dawn ..."" the materialism, classism, and racism (furthering people inter-warring) idea was explored more openly with the mall setting (the survivors partying inside being just a TAD too obviously borrowed from the pages of King Louie & Marie Antoinette) and was far less subtle, though at least still enjoyable and with a healty mix of humor.
  In ""Day,"" any subtlety has officially been devoured by an extra, digested, and forgotten as day old feces. Gone is the father who acts selfishly out of fear and want of safety for his family - instead we meet a bunch of guys who are jerks for no other reason than that they were cast as ""the bad guys."" Gone are subtle digs at government and western society, and in are long, conditioned speeches to such effect. Most sadly, gone are the occassional moments of whispered self-reflection, only to be replaced by the screamingly obvious (though, albeit, well performed) monologue by our ""fly-boy"" in which he proposes that we are finally getting our just rewards for messing in ""the Creator's"" business.
  It is also questionable whether the outlook wasn't a step too far toward the apocolyptic. To paraphrase Mr. Scrooge, what good is showing us our future if we can't change it? Are we to believe that the few remaining survivors at the conclusion represent ""hope""? Please don't misunderstand - I am NOT asking for a ""happy ending"" ... I'm instead merely wishing for some characters we could care about : some innocence left SOMEWHERE in this world gone to hell (well, besides Bub, of course.)
  Speaking of Bub, it is probably appropriate to explain why, with the above critism, I still gave it a four-star rating. Let me begin by saying this is, without question, a fine film - and and outstanding example of the genre. Compared with the majority of ""horror"" films, it stands with those few (""the Exorcist,"" ""Cemetary Man,"" etc.) which transend the genre and can be discussed as legitimate cinema. It is simply that, in comparison with his two previous, standard-setting films, ""Day of the Dead"" stands as their inferior.
  Except for Bub, that is. ""Bub"" is a zombie, obviously modeled after The Creature of Shelly's (as opposed to the Creature of Karloff's) Frankenstein. This, of course, would be obvious anyway, without the constant reference to the good doctor as ""Frankenstein"" - another example of Romero apparently thinking he needed to dummy down this final script to get his point across. Still, Bub is - quite simply - brilliantly scripted and performed. Yes, I admit, I feel a bit silly writing that (he is a zombie, after all), but it's true. The depth of love, angst, dispair, and innocence this actor displays through his make-up and grunting-only dialogue is truly stunning.
Overall, while all of the trilogy has a ""think-piece"" quality to it, ""Day of the Dead"" announces it unashamedly. For those who weary quickly of dialogue-heavy films, steer clear. For those who don't - as long as you don't mind being talked down to a bit and stilted performances by a good deal of the ""living"" cast, ""Day"" offers the best horrific vision of the future since ""1984,"" serves horror with a slice of intelligencia, and brings to the screen the best Frankenstein's Creature ever performed. Overall: one-and-a-half severed thumbs up.",919814400,,4085,5.002945508100147

321479,4,6301103513,"A group of survivalists, scientists and some Army soldiers take refuge in an abandoned missile silo in Florida. They seem to be the only ones in the area that are left alive and surrounded by the hordes of the living dead. The scientists are trying to figure out a way to make the zombie more domesticated. lol If that is possible it seems. ""Dr. Frankenstein"" is one of the scientists that believes he can make progress in doing this. By reconnecting to their memories that may still inhabit their brains, he hopes for a breakthrough cure. Progress is slow, but he does seem to be making it. The leader of the Army soldiers doesn't see it that way. He doesn't want to domesticate them at all. He wants extermination of the undead.
Eventually, through frustration and slow progress on one zombie in particular, Bud, Captain Rhodes, leader of the Army soldiers now, has had enough.
Mistakes have cost the team in Army lives, while trying to get ""specimens"" for the Scientist's experiments. Tensions are high as one of the Army soldiers ""loses"" his mind, or what was left of it, and goes up on top with the elevator to the area below. He lets himself get taken over by the undead all the while pushing the button to lower the elevator to the bottom and letting a few hundred zombies in to the compound.
With apparently no way out, the survivors that are left must defend themselves against an advancing horde with zero compassion for humans.

I have to say, it wasn't the best of the series, but it was enjoyable throughout. Lots of foul language by virtually all and the ending is fairly up to the task of what a zombie movie does best. I enjoyed the Special Features, particularly the new documentary with interviews of the cast and director George Romero. The picture quality, I don't know if this is the best they could have done, but it looked like it was a standard transfer to me.
If you are going to do a transfer of the film to HD, please do so. At least give us a new 2K or 4K scan of it. Looked like neither was done and it did not say so on back in the details section for this release.
Still was good to see, no dirt, etc. in the film and the Special Features are what make this release at least a 4 Star one for me.

321711,5,6301103513,"""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" may be the classics that inspired the genre, but Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" is the apex of the series and the film that perfected the style. That was always George Romero's plan  in making the movie, he was quoted saying that he intended to make the ""Gone with the Wind"" of zombie films. However, to make the film right and according to his artistic vision, he had to release the film unrated, but the studio would only provide him half the requested budget ($3.5 million rather than 7) for an unrated release. So in response, Romero scaled back the script to fit into that budget, setting almost the entire film in an underground bunker  and, if anything, that compromise worked for the better and made for an even more frightening, tonally perfect film.

The shared trait of every truly great piece of zombie fiction is when the central conflict isn't between the survivors and the undead, but between the survivors themselves  and even more than either of its predecessors, this conflict (soldiers and scientists) is the primary focus of ""Day"". ""Day of the Dead"" also takes the zombie makeup effects to new, more elaborate and wonderfully disgusting heights  including one iconic shot of a vivisected zombie lifting himself off a stretcher, his organs pouring out of his gut onto the floor.

Bottom line  if you are a fan of zombie films, or just horror in general, this film is seminal, required viewing.

Watch it. Now.",1464912000,4,1474,4.73046875
321712,5,6301103513,"One of the most under rated zombie films out there. And Definitely one of Romeros best movies. A lot of people disregard it because it was a lot darker in tone (literally and figuratively) from Dawn of the dead. Where Dawn of the dead had lots of comic relief and Bright colors down to the almost red paint like blood. Day of the Dead brings in the darkness visually and tonally, even the intro scenes in Florida present a deserted, drab, version of what is usually a tropical fun colorful location. Day of the Dead is set some years after Dawn of the Dead and the zombies show it. The characters are mentally breaking down from the stress of living underground with the threat of millions of undead roaming the ground above them, all the actors in the film did an amazing job portraying highly stressed mentally breaking down individuals and Captain Rhodes is one of those villains you just love to hate. My opinion of zombies having any sort of humanity in zombie films is that they shouldn't. Except when it comes to Bub. Bub (Howard Sherman) played the character zombie of Bub PERFECTLY. its entirely believable because you see the evolution of bub throughout the movie as Dr. Logan teaches him new things about his past life. as for Romero's second attempt at bringing intelligent zombies to the screen... just bad...

Do yourself a favor and watch Day of the Dead, hell if your a fan of zombies you've probably already seen it. so make a friend who hasn't seen it, watch it.",1464739200,3,1480,4.584905660377358

The audio is passable but still sounds like it was dubbed from a VHS tape. I guess there was only so much they could do with this film. Its still a big improvement over the DVD.

321815,3,6301103513,"We expect much better from George Romero than this very ordinary Zombie fodder.  Part of the problem must be blamed on the slashing of the budget from a Zombie flick robust$7.5 million to a much reduced $3.5 million.  Still, Romero and his crew do a credible job in the technical department.  The sound, lighting and Zombie make-up are up to what we want to see in a Zombie film directed by the master.
 The much amended script leaves much to be desired.  Money restraints kept Romero in re-writes until, I suspect, his original magic had devolved into this residue.  Still, it is a George A. Romero Zombie flick so we have to watch it.  It, even in this atrophied state, better than a lot of the stuff we have seen.
 We enter the story months after the world wide Zombie apocalypse has destroyed most of humanity.  Our heroes are a mixed bunch of surviving soldiers and scientists.  The soldiers had as their last mission to guard and protect the team of scientist who are hard at work on finding the elusive solution to the Zombie problem.  Well, they have been shut up in the underground facility long enough that the contending groups wear on each other.  Not to say that madness might well be breaking out.  Certainly the bearded, long haired soldiers find it difficult to maintain their military discipline.
 And the chief scientists condition you can easily imagine.  The soldiers call him Dr. Frankenstein.  Everyone has gotten a little ragged around the edges, which we know we want to avoid during a Zombie apocalypse. Cool heads equal survival in a Zombie apocalypse, crazy heads, not so much.
 The only real innovation to the cannon is a Zombie named Bub.  Dr.  Frankenstein is training him, trying to get beyond the reflexive eating of the living flesh part of the Zombie psyche and into something more satisfying.  The half soldiers want no part of such things.  The security force and the science team have a dramatic falling out that leads  to the Zombie hordes entering the secure facility.  Except for Bub we get nothing new.
 We do get some more or less good acting by real actors.  I did think that Joseph Pilato who played Rhodes, the army Captain in charge, was over the top from the beginning but maybe that was Romeros direction.  He appeared in Dawn of the Dead in 1978 and in 2010 had a role in Night of the Living Dead: Origins 3D.  He has loads of small roles in big movies and big roles in small movies to his credit.  Lori Cardille also has a number of roles on her sheet, mostly on TV in the 80s, and turned in a competent effort as the lady scientist Dr. Bowman, awkwardly for her, the only woman in the isolated underground facility, trapped with armed men slowly going mad.  She also has a previous Romero connection.  He dad had a sporting role in the original 1968 Night of the Living Dead.  The best acting came from Terry Alexander who played the helicopter pilot, a guy with a Jamaican accent.  Unlike most of the others, his character was neither vile nor crazy, so he stands out.  We know him best from his long running role on One Life to Live, a TV soap opera.
 Day of the Dead carries an expected R rating for lots of Zombie style violence, some nasty stuff said to the only woman character and a lot of bad language.  The run time is a little over average at one hour and 40 minutes.  The Zombie make-up and the associated effects-gun shots, chewing and spurting blood are all up to the high standards that we expect.  The script however cannot be called tight by any stretch.  The gun fire clearly was a post production add-on, which works only if we don't notice.  Here we noticed.
 Even the great George Romero can muster a small two and a half brains for this sub-par effort.  The total take to date on DVD and the small theatrical box office amounts to some $34 million and counting.  Not bad for a not too good movie made for $3.5 million.",1442102400,,3890,4.498571428571428
321816,4,6301103513,One of George Romero's better earlier zombie films when he was on a roll.  You have to be a true Zombie fan to enjoy it because it does have a lot of gore especially near the end.  But it does have a happy ending.,1441929600,2,213,3.8181818181818183

321818,5,6301103513,"I have watched and purchased George A. Romero's ""Day of the dead"" on Beta Max, VHS, VHS remastered, DVD, DVD remastered and then I saw that Shout Factor was going to release a Blu-Ray version, the product you see here.  After watching the movie in so many other formats multiple times, I thought if a Blu-Ray version could bring anything more to the table.  The answer is yes.  If you are a ""attention to detail freak"" and trying to discover ""hidden things"" that you didn't see in other formats of the movies, then this version (Blu-Ray) will be a treasure trove for you.  For the fans who have already seen and love the movie, you know there are many times where it is difficult to see zombies walking far in the background of the caves.  On this Blu-Ray, you can see the large and small groups of zombies in detail where in other older formats, you just saw darkness and maybe some movements.  Prime examples would be actually seeing the zombies coming closer when Steele is calling out to them to be captured and the crowd zombies chasing after Rickles and Steele at the end.  If you do not care about such detail but still like the movie, then a Blu-Ray version will probably not make the movie more enjoyable for you.",1441584000,,1222,4.4774774774774775
321819,1,6301103513,"Saw this on netlfix and it sucks, I really enjoyed the first 2 but this is just bad.  The acting is awful, and the Bub character is too.  Actually the whole premise of the movie is ridik when you start to think about it.  Frankenstien (the lead scientist) has one zombie out of the thousands hes experimented on that he can ""tame"", and thats his solution to zombie apocalypse, re-educate one zombie at a time i guess.  The military guys are so over the top evil its just obnoxious, the only two people with half a brain have stupid accents (Jamaican mon, and a boozy Irishmen).  Heres the deal, i ususally don't take a movie to task over scientific failings, but when half the movie is scientists talking about limbic systems and such you cant gloss over the stupidity of it. I mean there is no way this small group (8 people) can retrain the billions of zombies out there, its just so stupid. Oh, and for all the people out there who think this was some brave send up of the american militrary vs science or something, please go watch a twilight zone episode for you scifi/social commentary",1440892800,2,1091,4.4623115577889445

321873,3,6301103513,"This one showed a lot of promise. I walked away loving and hating a lot of things in it. I'm a huge fan of the first two films. The special effects should be noted, they are very well done. The camera work and music is also well done.

Unfortunately I realized within the first twenty minutes of it what I was in for when it came to the bad guys. They are loud, obnoxious, and belligerent. Not impressed. I liked the overall concept of how lack of communication and different goals leads to conflict but it could've been presented in a more interesting or adult way. The acting here overall is not very good. I liked the good guys enough though and was rooting for them to survive. A lot of people liked the scientist guy ""Frankenstein"" and his experiments. I however did not. I was cringing when he was teaching the zombie all sorts of things. If we're watching this for a laugh okay but otherwise I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about that in a zombie horror movie. I can respect that it added something new and different but it's just incredibly cheesy and I never liked the idea of zombies with weapons anyway but it's a minor complaint. The last 30 minutes of this movie are awesome. This movie needed more cool fighting in the dark tunnels and less senseless fighting between the two groups, although I suppose that's what they were going for, I just think it could've been done better.",1437436800,,1398,4.439688715953308
321874,5,6301103513,"This is my favorite zombie flick of all time. This movie differs from the other Dead films in that it isn't about a group of people trying to survive. Instead it's a movie about a team of scientists trying to find a cure to the epidemic, but the military group assigned to assist them is wondering what exactly is going on since they're slowly dying off trying to protect the scientific team and themselves. There's no outside communication and any effort to find civilization ends in failure. With no outside communication and being left to fend for themselves, we slowly watch as two sides succumb to insanity and eventually destroying each other.

The one character I absolutely loved in this film is Captain Rhodes. I don't think I ever seen another film that can capture the spirit of the character. Captain Rhodes is the only character in this entire film who made actual sense. The head scientists, Dr Logan, also known as Frankenstein for slicing up the zombie specimens wanted to train zombies in a manner similar to how one might train kids. We slowly learn that Dr Logan has a serious mental problem and his experiment is delusional but by that time it was too late for everyone to realize. Captain Rhodes allowed Dr Logan a benefit of a doubt in his experiment. Throughout the film we see Captain Rhodes becoming increasing agitated but the Captain wanted the experiment to proceed since the scientists are so sure of a solution.

Right from the get go Captain Rhodes appears arrogant, cocky, and hard headed in terms of trying to get him to see the scientist's side of the problem. However, after watching the film a few times over the years what I accepted is that Captain Rhodes is always asking the right question which is: exactly what the scientists are doing? Throughout the movie Captain Rhodes gave the science team enough shadow of a doubt to allow them to progress and come out with a possible solution even though his men are increasingly frustrated. However, each interaction with each other turns up more questions and doubts until eventually their anger and frustration turns them against each other. I too always questioned exactly what the scientists intentions were. Not once did any side actually came up with anything remotely possible and even Dr Logan's trained zombie concept seem flawed in many ways.

The thing I most dislike about this film is that at the end Captain Rhodes not only turned into a murderous buffoon but also a traitor and coward to his own men. He died in the most horrendous manner possible in the entire film. Not only that, he died from the very experiment that he allowed to continue with a smart zombie known as Bub. Throughout the entire film, Captain Rhodes did not kill a single zombie. He only killed unarmed scientists and killed his own men by abandoning them.

Whenever I watch this movie, I secretly wish that Captain Rhodes turned out to be the hero. I honestly wish the could remake this film but instead change the point of the movie where Captain Rhodes turned into a complete idiot and got everyone killed.

Overall a great movie to see Captain Rhodes interaction. I bought the collectors Blu Ray edition and wow, it is a major upgrade from my old dvd copy of the film. Absolutely love it. Now I only wish they released the Ultimate Edition of Dawn of the Dead on Blu Ray.",1435881600,12,3345,4.691652470187393

321876,3,6301103513,"I first saw this on TV a long time ago and thought it was okay. Then I saw it on cinemassacre.com as one of the video reviews uncut I was surprised and a little scared too. Of all the over the top gore that is as well as other stuff. Starts with our lady hero longing to be outside even thought shes in a room. She wakes up on a helicopter after touching a calender and the people in the helicopter land near the city to see if theres any survivors. There isn't but theres an alligator in the city that got turned, maybe?

After that they go an land near this bunker thats underground which is supposed to be their home. One of the survivors think about escaping to some island to get away from all of it but they cant because of the soldiers. Most of this movie I heard is mostly talking and I think thats true after watching it now. Also its kinda claustrophobic in this underground confined place most of the movie. The soldiers here are jerks and their commander is an even bigger jerk than all of them combine. Theres also a professor they call Frankenstein that tries to study them and he looks like all those crazy doctors in movies. The professor also teaches this one zombie, Bub, about stuff as a was to control them a bit.

The gore here is also over the top and pretty graphic even in HD. Also I swear one of the guys is Mr. Bean in this movie too. During getting another zombie for research a solider gets his arm bitten and they cut it off and burn where his arm got cut off, So he doesnt bleed out so much.

After the commander goes crazy and kills some of the scientists as well as put some of the survivors in the zombie room. There we also see the shovel kill too where the zombie is still going. The remaining survivors take the back way out of the bunker to the helicopter. While the guy who got bitten lures the zombies into the bunker to kill the soldiers. These are some pretty graphic scenes of the soldiers getting ripped apart as well as the commander who gets shot a couple of times before that happens.

I heard they used cow guts for all the gore they used and they ended up getting spoiled so even the actors are suffering in these scenes as well. Theres also a light at the end of the tunnel Ill just say at the end of this movie. This movie is also considered to be the best of the Dead series with some people. To me it felt a little slow with all the talking scenes at times and no real action until the end. Thats just what I think and you can give this a watch on Netflix if you want to. Since thats where I watched the uncut version and Ill even give Land of the Dead a watch and review one day too.",1434067200,,2636,4.112621359223301

That is why I can't enjoy these movies because of the fact that there is such an obsession with zombies and the belief that they are possible. Can anyone tell me why is that every single zombie movie begins with an ""apocalypse?"" Can mindless, rotting, corpses that can't plan or defend themselves really take over the world?

Most of the few characters involved in this third offering of the dead are more repellent than the zombies they study/dissect.  If that was the point, then it was apt, but still off-putting.  A bunch of goons cackling and threatening violence is just plain annoying.  This is amateur theatrics at its worse.  It only served to distract from the more interesting aspects of the story.  They didn't do nearly enough with Dr. Frankenstein (Richard Liberty), making him a minor character.  Instead, they focused on the ramblings and ravings of the lunatic in charge of this hidden underground field lab (Joseph Pilato as Captain Rhodes).  How many rants do you need to watch before you get the point?
Still, for all the wasted opportunities and unrealized potential, this remains an entertaining film with a few redeeming scenes that are quite startling.  But.  This film could have used more Bub the Zombie and less of Joseph Pilato and his crew of halfwits.",1392595200,,1045,4.886363636363637

people looking at this on amazon have seen the film already. I am just state

the fact that this collectors edition has a nearly 90 minute documentary which

is worth the money alone. It is an absolutely amazing documentary, and it is

great to see most of the actors and people involved recalling their experience

today. The legacy documentary was filmed in 2013 so some of the actors passed

away unfortunately. I know Libery passed away 13 years ago but does anyone

know where terry alexanders helicopter radio/tech partner is? Did he also

pass? I have not wikipediad or imdbd him. Anyways, get this release, it is the

best out there but the 2 commentaries are the old ones. imo the

picture/transfer is great but nearly Iidentical to the previous release. I

think it was anchor bay? I let a workmate borrow it and never got Iit back...

First of all the cover art for the Scream Factory Release of this movie is awesome. There are new special features available that weren't available on the Anchor Bay DVD release. The movie itself is a dark and dreary George Romero zombie flick set mostly underground. Tom Savini really ups the ante on gore and zombie mayhem in this third part of Romero's Dead trilogy. The film showcases some of the best gore scenes put on celluloid. Some scenes from this film even inspired Greg Nicotero to pay homage to them in the AMC series The Walking Dead. Some fans and critics believe Day of the Dead was the weakest entry in the trilogy, but looking at it again I believe it rivals both Dawn of the Dead and Night of the Living Dead in creepiness, zombie action, creative gore, and story. I recommend anyone who hasn't seen this film yet to pick it up today and enjoy this zombified masterpiece.",1385337600,,988,4.4944444444444445

322222,5,6301103513,"Day of the Dead has been released on Blu-ray by Shout! Factory. The transfer is sharp and clear. There are some debates among some fans of the film as to minor differences in image quality, but I can't see any radically disturbing approaches that would persuade me that there is any large divisive issue. For completists, it should be noted that this new release of Day does not have all of the extras that were on the Anchor Bay DVD version in 2003; however, Shout!'s Blu-ray also has a number of new extras, some of them pretty extensive, on the behind the scenes productions and difficulties of getting this third entry in George Romero's series finally into film reality.

The bottom line on this is if you want all the features, then selling the old edition and making shelf space is not an option. If space is at a premium for you, then you know, that sucks. It's the collector's curse!

One of the extras features on Shout! s Day has Tom Savini discussing all the practical gore effects done in the last half of the film. There are no CGI blood spurts here, and if you are one of those whose fondest desire is to see what a body looks like when its insides come tumbling out, intestines and all, just gushing from torn-apart flesh, then Tom Savini had made your fondest wish real.

I get a kick out of seeing Tom Savini, one of the best of the gore special effects gurus, as a young guy showing off how he made the effects look so realistic. Well, I've seen something close to this in Army training films, so Tom does have it pretty damn close, but here's why I get a kick out of him drenched in red innards.

Tom, surrounded by sausage guts and dark blood colored syrup, looks so delighted at his achievement. Savini, is a kid in gorish glee. A kid making good. Right there, you can see a man making his dreams of years come true.

Day of the Dead did not have an immediate acceptance from film critics, from the general audience or from gore hounds. A reassessment of Romero's claustrophobic ""zombies in mammoth caverns captivity"" would come about when the video tape revolution gave new life to films that were abandoned and thought gone until VHS gave home to the lost and the rise of a new life for films, that one could easily rent or buy them and have them in their own homes.

Listen, I have Dawn of the Dead and Halloween, also transferred by Anchor Bay, they look phenomenal!! I don't know if I have the wrong version of this movie, but the movie I purchased looks terrible. I'm talking about this new and improved Shout transfer version.  If you like low resolution and a lot of grain than you must not like blue ray. Because Blu-Ray is ""HIGH DEF"".

322283,4,6301103513,"I don't know how Scream Factory keeps acquiring the fine horror gems they are releasing, but good for them. George A. Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" finally gets the Blu-ray Collector's Edition upgrade it deserves. I don't know if it's my imagination, but it seems like it was the intent of both Romero and makeup artist Tom Savini to step up the gore a few notches with each one. This third entry in the franchise moves forward with a few more buckets of blood and body parts.

Military and scientific personnel hole up together in an underground hideaway to keep away from zombies who walk the earth in search of their next meal of flesh. The military are looking for a way to exterminate the walking dead, while the scientists strive to re-civilize them through horrific experiments. The scientists and soldiers find themselves at odds with each other as the zombies close in on their subterranean bunker.

I'll be honest in saying that the first hour of ""Day of the Dead"" was slow. Just as I was giving up on it, the pace picked up and the movie was saved in the last 30 minutes. Although it might seem like it moves at the speed of a snail and is talky, I give props to Romero for taking the time and energy to actually establish character development and a storyline that reaches beyond simply finding ways to kill zombies.

Something else I noticed about ""Day of the Dead"" is that it feels timeless. Even though it was made in the mid-1980s, it isn't aged by the clothing, hairstyles, or even technology worn and used by the characters in the film. Romero found a way to remain neutral in these areas, giving it a longevity not found in many other movies in this genre.

""Day of the Dead"" is given a new high-definition transfer for this Collector's Edition. It's presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1). The picture is clean and manages to maintain a ""real film"" flavor. DTS-HD Master Audio Mono sound guarantees the movie sounds better than ever before.

Loads of special features are found on the ""Day of the Dead"" Collector's Edition. Audio commentary is provided by Writer/Director George A. Romero, Special Makeup Effects Artist Tom Savini, Production Designer Cletus Anderson, and actress Lori Cardille. A new documentary entitled ""World's End: The Legacy of 'Day of the Dead'"" is found as well. There's also behind-the-scenes footage from Tom Savini's archives. It also contains photo galleries, theatrical trailers, TV spots, and more.

The ""Day of the Dead"" Collector's Edition is a must-have for every fan of George A. Romero's apocalyptic series. It's not simply a zombie film, but a study in human behavior and ethics. It doesn't only give viewers plenty of blood and guts to gawk at, it gives them something to think about as well.",1380153600,,2763,4.781970649895178
322284,4,6301103513,"Ok, first let me say right from the get-go, that I am a HUGE fan of this film and basically, all of Mr. Romero's ""Dead"" films. Each has its own 'tone' and style. My favorite (not that you asked) is and always will be ""Night of the Living Dead,"" of which I contend is the single best horror film ever made. film. Now, I am a little biased, I was in ""Day of the Dead"" and created the first authorized documentary to commemorate ""Night of the Living Dead."" Having said that, I am still a fan and going into Shout Factory's Collector's Edition, I was an eager fan begging for more. I thought Anchor Bay's Blu of ""Day of the Dead"" was pretty nice all around, but of course the 2-Disc DVD was the ultimate package for this movie.

Shout Factory's release has some cool stuff going for it, so first as to what I appreciated. The newly designed cover art, and the reversible sleeve was pretty cool. I loved the brief piece about the mine location, (It was called the Wampum Industrial Storage Facility when I first saw it) but it was too short. A whole lot more could have been done with that location; for instance pointing out even more specific rooms and interiors that were used for various sets. Still, It was enjoyable and even a bit nostalgic to see it again. (Apparently it is not easy to gain access to that place these days)

As for the new documentary; a mixed bag for me, but mostly enthusiasm. I absolutely loved seeing the crew, cast and even supporting players as they are 'now', reminiscing about being in the film. Just about everyone 'that was anyone in the film' and still alive, is there with a few exceptions; namely ""Rickles"" Did I miss him in this documentary? If I remember correctly, he is not even referred to in the documentary. If I'm wrong I apologize. I really loved the material with Gary Klar and Terry Alexander. Terry is the guy I chose to interview for our city newspaper, and he was a most gracious and appreciative interviewee and actor. Gary was on the set when I was there and was cordial to everyone. I thought his performance was a stand-out in the film. He's a terriffic character actor. The other interviews were good and informative, but I have already seen them saying pretty much the same thing in other documentaries associated with the film, but being a fan, the more material the better! On the whole, the documentary was decent, but I think it went on about a half-hour too long and some of it seemed redundant. Still, its a new ""Day"" documentary, and that is cool in itself!

The rest of the package is ok I guess. I've seen most of the stills in other releases,and the newer stuff felt like images that were available to the other ""Day"" packages, but were turned down. If you're a 'completist' (which I am), you'll want the never-before-seen stills regardless.

Talk about wishy-washy!

See, this is what happens when you're a fan of Mr. Romero and his ""Dead"" saga; it's TOUGH to be critical! I'm glad I bought it and I'm just going to shut up about anything negative. The Arrow U.K. Blu-Ray for ""Day of the Dead"" is extremely cool, with packaging and bonuses that will knock your socks off. As for the supplements, they are different from the Shout Factory edition, and there are a few exclusives. If you're a completist, you'll want both.",1379548800,3,3284,4.503355704697986

The acting was very good and many today's actors have something to learn from this movie of the past. Gore was very well done for the 1985 it was disgusting as well and today many filmmakers can learn from this movie. It's really a shame to see many movies in 2013 that is far worse than 1985 in acting or special effects. Make up effects were pretty old for those days, however it didn't look bad at all. The main walking dead character didn't look stupid at all when he was learning all the basic things. In many today's movies it would have almost every time looked stupid and unconvincing. The ending was somewhat cut very short. They could have done at least 5 more minutes of the movie, but it didn't make the movie any worse. It's a very well done classic, with a good plot.

322316,2,6301103513,"At times the film took on all the aspects of Abbott and Costello Meet the Frankenstein Monsters or, as my title indicates, a Mel Brooks script that went awry. At any rate, while a presence, sort of like off stage sound effects, the Zombies play little role in the movie, they are a motivating force field within which Romero stages his drama. He leaves no doubt what that drama is: MAD SCIENTISTS VS. MAD SOLDIERS. Only pure compassionate WOMANHOOD and, well I couldn't make out much of the dialog when they  spoke, but apparently PURE (fill in the ethnic category if you heard more clearly than I)........., deserve to survive. (I should note that, as is true of many more viewers than you would think, without subtitles, a substantial portion of the soundtrack is lost on me.) There are effective scenes, Romero is talented, but after a nice opening scene, it begins to go downhill and never stops, save for the occasional bits which could profitably transferred to any Good Zombie movie, such as some of his others. With the exception of the female lead, who is mostly allowed to look luscious while doing some acting and one of the Good Guys, who is given a few decent lines,  the rest of the cast has been assigned the task of chewing up the scenery, hardly to be called acting, which they do with enthusiasm. The Mad Scientist is mostly directed to sound like he was acting in a 1940's comedy programmer (B  picture) serving as Assistant to Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff or Humphrey Bogart (in The Return of Doctor X).
Suffice to say, I would recommend this only to devotees of George Romero or someone with a reason to want to experience all of his pictures. If you miss it, you will never MISS IT.",1371686400,,1702,4.573770491803279
322317,5,6301103513,"For me Day of the Dead it is my favorite of the Romero Dead films. I am an overall fan of the entire series (Night,Dawn,Day and Land of the Dead), but Day of the Dead is my all time favorite. The special efx, Bub with his headphones, the gore (Good God there is some awesome gore in this film), and of course, one of my all time favorite d-bag characters in a movie...Rhodes!!! Rhodes has got to be THE role model for Shane on The Walking Dead. I'm not gonna get into specifics and plot points, because chances are most of you have already seen this film...and for those that haven't...get ride for a fun ride! This will 100% be a definite pre-order on Blu Ray. Further proof that Romero is a living, breathing Horror God!!!",1371513600,14,724,4.330882352941177
322357,2,6301103513,"Day of the Dead, Romero's third zombie film, is easily his weakest in regards to the original trilogy. Whereas Night had a chilling concept that still holds up to this day, and Dawn flourishes on that concept in every which direction, Day does the opposite, and contracts like a scared anushole. The story is rather boring, and if anything it's a major step back from Dawn, seeing as how 95% of the movie is in an underground bunker.

The main meat (PUN FULLY INTENDED) of the movie here is how the scientists are working on domesticating the zombies, and the military are getting uneasy and want no part of being around the experiments. Now what could've worked well here is show both sides having valid arguments, which would've made the power struggle more engaging to watch. Instead we get a moustache-twirling racist military commander who pretty much shouts ""I'M IN CHARGE AROUND HERE!"", complete with a crew of yes-men who either do nothing or go ""yes boss right away boss"". Meanwhile on the other side of the coin we have the monotone main character chick (who sort of stops being the main character by the 3rd act), a wacky Jamaican pilot, a drunk Irish radio technician, and a stir-crazy Latino. The two scientists are basic stereotypes in of themselves. So therein lies the biggest problem with Day of the Dead, lazy, predictable one-dimensional characters that mainly argue amongst each other to the point where you'll probably forget about the silly little zombie threat.

The scientists have an interesting part where one of them had a domesticated zombie by the name of ""Bub"". This whole thing seemed out of place for a Romero zombie film, however Bub ended up having more character and personality then the rest of the cast in this film, not a good sign. There were a few little things that sort of annoyed me about this film as well, such as the commander surprising the scientists twice in the exact same set-up. Or how it looks like they forgot to edit out the part where the scientist rambles on about how Bub got his name. Or how the little trailer get-a-way ended up serving no purpose after it's set up. But the biggest thing of all that irks me about Day of the Dead, is how Romero has set up a fascinating apocalyptic world, and then shows us the most boring scenario possible: people in a bunker arguing.

The rare glimpses we actually get of the overrun world were good, especially the opening scene, which is a chilling precursor to 28 Days Later's opening. And the ending when the zombies were flooding in and eating some people was amplified by the make-up and gore effects. But these few instances of interest were far and few between the melodrama. Really though it's surprising how the budget for this film seemed like a big step back from Dawn's, you'd think Romero would've gotten more funding and put it to good use for this film. Ah well, at least we got Land of the Dea-I mean Diary of th-I mean Surviva-forget it.",1369785600,4,2952,4.6513409961685825

322360,5,6301103513,"Do Zombies like classical music?  Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead. This is truly the original zombie trilogy. It's packed with thoughtful gore and spanned three decades.  Night started it. Dawn was awesome. Day pushed it to epic proportions.  Day of the Dead came out in 1985 & was directed by classic zombie circus maestro George Romero.  The zombie trilogy explores how humans react when they are trapped and faced with crisis.  It's very interesting to think that Day of the Dead came out in 1985. This film has 80's movie elements but its purely a Romero style event.  A visonary, Romero's style and story telling truly transcend time. Day of the Dead is certainly the most challenging of the original three films.  It's very dark but unarguably a classic zombie movie.  In this installment the zombies have almost completely taken over. There are a few humans left alive and they are trapped in an underground military bunker. To appreciate Day of the Dead, you really have to appreciate the higher reaching scope. In other words, there is simply more going on here then zombies eating brains. The humans are actually experimenting with zombies. They are trying to figure out what makes them tick. The real problem is that no progress can made because of constant conflict among the dwindling number of surviving humans.  Bat crazy mad scientists? Check! Evil power hungry military commanders? Check!  Impeccable zombie gore? Double check!  B-movie schlock? Oh yea, check. Deep rooted philosophical meditations on the human condition? Yes, it's all here. It's important to watch this one with an open mind. Compared to Night & Dawn it does pale a little. Compare to any other average zombie flicks, it reigns supreme.  Day pushed the zombie envelope and enhanced the overall mythos. There is a little something here for everyone - zombies included!",1369526400,,1881,4.936507936507937

I didn't watch it for all that, but caught a bit here and there. Mainly, this was just a good, gory, intelligent movie. It's the end here, folks!

Update: I contacted Scream Factory and they said this.

Hi Justin,

As a rule of thumb, our Scream Factory collectors editions only have their slipcovers manufactured for the first three months after street date.  After that window has ended, they are no longer manufactured, and are only available while supplies last.

Because this is a fairly old release, we no longer have slipcovers, sorry.
