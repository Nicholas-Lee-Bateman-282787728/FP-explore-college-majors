7875776,4,6304653573,Not bad for exploitation movie though could have had a few things a little better in terms of why things in the story happened,1489968000,,126,4.291666666666667
7875777,1,6304653573,"This DVD is one of the worst I have ever seen. It is not erotic, or even interesting, at all. It stars an extremely unattractive actress named April Adams (and I use the term ""actress"" inappropriately, since Adams does not seem capable of acting at all) playing the part of a poor little rich girl housesitting for her wealthier uncle. Are we supposed to have any sympathy for this character?
Adams spend most of this movie acting as though she is allergic to smiling, or indeed to showing any facial expression other than a dull pouting one. This despite the fact that her character Eve apparently wishes to be a model.
The director, Henri Lumiere, does not seem to have the slightest idea of how to tell a story. This film seems very underwritten, due to it's lack of plot. It is not even entertaining as a skin flick, due to the lack of full frontal nudity.
As for the extras... what extras? I remember how things were back in the 1990s, when Troma actually cared enough about their DVD releases to put a lot of bonus features on them, how Troma once cared enough to make certain that every DVD had at least one thing that was exclusive, that could not be found on any other Troma DVD. (Remember ""Class of Nuke 'Em High""? Or ""Troma's War""? How about ""Bloodsucking Freaks""? Each of these DVDs had at least one thing that was exclusive to it, that could only be found on each particular DVD.) It seems that those days are now gone. On this one, as on a number of Troma's more recent releases, the only ""bonus materials"" are a bunch of commercials for other Troma products. Most of these could be seen on the VHS tape.
In short, if you buy this you will get a very boring movie with no DVD extras. It would probably be better for you to just skip this one.",1062892800,6,1756,4.373088685015291
7875778,4,6304653573,"This film is hard to discribe, I think it tries to be a comedy, but the story is sort of a coming of age plot. I enjoyed Eve's Beach Fantasy because the film was well thought out, and it had somebody you wanted to  see succeed (also the nude scenes every 20 min. or so didn't hurt much). I  also liked the theme song I would love to hear a soundtrack for this film.",948240000,3,365,3.918918918918919
7875779,3,6304653573,"The film really has no plot, no biggie though, a lot of filmsdon't.  The comedy is extremely dry and hardly funny.  The nude scenes that are shown every twenty minutes are top notch at times.  buy it for that I guess.  The theme is a stressed out girl who's house sitting her uncle's house.  Rent this first because you'll either want to see it once or every other day.  You might want to fast forward through some scenes.",941414400,8,422,4.346153846153846
