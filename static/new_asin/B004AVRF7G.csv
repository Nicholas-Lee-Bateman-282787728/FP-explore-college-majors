8421018,3,B004AVRF7G,"The movie Anaam is a romantic thriller which comes with an ordinary story that totally confusing, the script of the story is just taken as bits and pieces from here and there. There is nothing special about the movie. The story of the movie revolves around the life of Angre ( Sadashiv Amrapurkar ), an honest police inspector who places his duty above his personal life. One day an unclaimed fiat car was found stranded in front of the hotel Blue Ribbon Hotel. Soon it was found out that car belonged to Ghanshyamdas Gupta now the case comes in the hands of inspector Angre to find out the thief who stole it. Overall, the movie is good and enjoyable. It was average at the Box office and is worth to set for weekend.",1302220800,,718,4.406015037593985
