8375808,4,B002O18APU,"Many historians fail to give the first day's fighting at Gettysburg as having defined the rest of the engagement to some degree or another.  This certainly gets the point across, and does so with much attention given to details that are often ignored.  Most people focus on the fighting that took place on Cemetery Ridge and/or Culp's Hill or Little Round Top.  Rarely does anyone point out that the first day's fighting allowed the Union Army to concentrate in such an advantageous position - and from this position they managed to hang on for the next two days against determined Confederate attacks.

The episode does not entirely neglect the rest of the battle, though, and it answers common questions that the un-obsessed often pose about other elements that took place on 2-3 July.  My personal interest was piqued when they address faulty fuses utilized by the Confederates for their artillery.  I do think some of this problem was alleviated by whatever captured Union provisions they had undoubtedly taken with them, but nonetheless, it does make a good case as to why the Confederate barrage (which when combined with the Union reply created the loudest man-made sound on the North American continent until 1945) was so ineffective.

Definitely an episode worth watching for those who are history nerds such as myself.",1379808000,,1328,5.009090909090909
