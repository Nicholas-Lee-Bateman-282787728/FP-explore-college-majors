8254133,5,B00142GL24,"I agree with the other two reviewers -- this is an outstanding movie and true story about the unintentional abandonment of a group of sled dogs by a Japanese research team, and the subsequent effect the abandonment had on the men. They had become devoted to the dogs and could not shake the feelings of
guilt when they returned to Japan. The movie follows the men in Japan and the dogs as they struggle to survive in a harsh frozen wilderness. I am fortunate enough to have a VHS copy of the movie and I have seen it a number of times. Every time I do, I cry like a faucet, nonstop. I know I am lucky to have a copy of the movie -- they are incredibly scarce these days, at least in the United States. I have a dubbed version of course. I have seen so many touching animal movies, but for some reason, this one hits more nerves than just about any of them. It's agonizing -- more so because it really happened.

As for Eight Below, it's supposed to be a fictionalized remake, but hey, it's not even remotely the same. It's not a substitute for this and it's sort of a silly movie.

Antartica is powerful and real. I highly recommend it but spread some towels around your seat first. You'll be bawling.",1258761600,8,1201,4.2631578947368425
8254134,5,B00142GL24,"This is a really great true story, wonderfully told, beautifully shot, and this film held the ""top-grossing domestic film of all time"" position in Japan for years until ""Princess Mononoke"" took its place.  I love this film, and cried buckets when I first saw it.  It's heart-wrenching, especially when you know it really happened.... and amazing, when you think about it.  How can dogs live a year on their own in such a harsh environment??

If you ever get the chance and if Disney would re-release it (they bought the rights), see this movie, not its watered-down Disney-fied remake (""Eight Below"").  You won't regret it.

PS, if you go to Japan, you can see the memorial to these dogs in Tokyo.

8254135,5,B00142GL24,"The product description is pretty close.  Half the dog teem breaks away from the chain, the movie follows their journey but only two survive, the other half die on the chains.  The cinematography is superb, the music fantastic.  You can still get Vangelis's Antartica CD, you'll know listening to the music how great it all is (and know when the dogs break away, this is a total empathic tapestry of sound). This is a real life story, a docu-drama I believe they call it, won awards, and the cheap Disney remake of it ages later (Eight Below) is, in comparison, a shadow of the original, Hollywood piece of cr***.  The Japanese expediditon did not intend to leave them, not cancelled or wait for a second, their regular routine was to withdraw for the worst of the winter to the mothership, but ice froze in so fast that they couldn't make the second trip back to the camp for the dogs & remainder. This is extremely poignant, artful, and a shame it's not to be found.",1239494400,9,968,4.514285714285714
