8185605,1,B000OLG55E,"The worst DVD in the history of Travel DVDs.
It was done by an amateur: you never see him as he is in a car for the whole tour. All you see are the entrances of buildings.
He never gets off the car, never walks anywhere, never goes in the buildings, never shows you anything like the view from the Empire State building.
The editing of the music is horrendous and the typed written comments are so ridiculous, my 3rd grade students would do better.
WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT...",1462665600,,484,4.329670329670329
8185606,1,B000OLG55E,"HORRIBLE VIDEO - DO NOT BUY!  -  It looks like some guy took a taxi around town and stuck his cheap personal video camera out the window.  It was all really laughably bad.  And so many things were either misspelled or incorrectly identified, it was obvious the makers were not from New York or even from America.  I just wish I would have cut my NYC vacation short so I could get home in time to make the return window.  Sorry guys, but save the twenty bucks, spend it on some slices!  And gee, wonder why there is no contact info available for the seller?  I would have given them the chance to accept my return instead of this scathing review!",1352851200,5,645,4.2727272727272725
8185607,1,B000OLG55E,"Please do not buy this DVD. This DVD is very bad and in no case helpful if you want to make a trip to New York. The movie was made with a wiggly camera in winter to spring; the Central Park without any leaves on the trees looks very strange. The music is kludgy, on the cover you will find mistakes in writing, write errors you will find in some of the film titles, too. I was so disappointed that I removed the DVD after not more than 30 minutes from my DVD player.",1201046400,8,466,3.9680851063829787
