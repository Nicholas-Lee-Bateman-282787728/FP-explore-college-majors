8306558,3,B001GPLSRC,"BHALE DONGALU is a 2008 Bollywood comedy, and it's just okay. There. That's the gist of this review, which I will now pad.

Okay, BHALE DONGALU is about two young dreamers who long to burst out from the confines of their Indian culture and tradition. Ramu is repulsed by the low salaried job his father wants him to interview for. Jyothy aspires to be Miss India and recoils at the thought of her upcoming arranged marriage. Ramu and Jyothy run away from home and end up meeting on a train. When their luggage is stolen and then they start getting fleeced left and right by crooks and scoundrels, the disillusioned couple decide to take to a life of crime. And, because this is a comedy, everything turns out fine. Except maybe for the viewer, who may feel that his or her soul had been sucked out a little.

At least BUNTY AUR BABLI starred three bonafide Bollywood stars in Abhishek Bachchan, Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukerji and featured ""Kajra Re,"" a song which became a sensation in India. Instead of the sobriquets ""Bunty & Babli,"" Ramu and Jyothy take on the aliases of ""Romeo & Juliet.""

The film strives for a good-natured and breezy Robin Hood feel, but falls flat. It's just not very funny, and at 2 hours 37 minutes, that's a whole lot of not being funny. And it doesn't help that the pace plods and the plot is stale. Having already seen BUNTY AUR BABLI, I was always a step ahead of this one. In fact, the only plot device not taken from BUNTY AUR BABLI is Babli's pregnancy. The two lead actors, Tarun and Ileana D'Cruz, are likable enough that I did feel a sense of satisfaction as they conned a slew of opportunistic sleazebags, married horndogs, and drug dealers. Plus, they end up helping a very sick little girl, so you can't really hate on them. However, the scams and tricks Romeo & Juliet pull off are mostly uninspired. I did like how Romeo, while being chased by the police, tricked the passengers into evacuating the train he was on. Tarun isn't in Abhishek's league, but Ileana is so damn pretty that I choose to overlook how silly and affected her character is. But Tarun and Ileana don't create enough sparks between them to ignite the film. The only times the movie seems infused with any form of suspense and energy are whenever Romeo & Juliet tangle with the movie's big bad, a vicious underworld kingpin named Veerraju.

This time, the Deputy Commissioner of Police in pursuit isn't played by the stately Amitabh Bachchan but by someone named Jagapati Babu, who just doesn't have Amitabh's presence. However, Babu does fight scenes better and his character shares that same hidden heart of gold. As in BUNTY AUR BABLI, the gruff policeman's actions are key to the story's resolution.

My favorite scene in BUNTY AUR BABLI is undisputedly ""Kajra Re,"" in which stunning guest star Aishwarya Rai has never looked better (but I say that a lot in most of her movies). BHALE DONGALU follows BUNTY AUR BABLI closely enough that it tries to come up with a parallel item number. But what surfaces (""Pasandaina Vela"") doesn't come close to having the hook of or being as spirited as ""Kajra Re"" and the featured girl, Charmme, falters in Aishwarya Rai's shadow. The rest of the songs are also unmemorable, with Justin Timberlake's ""I'm Bringing Sexy Back,"" heard in the background during a nightclub scene, qualifying as the film's catchiest tune. And that's just sad.

So, two and a half stars for BHALE DONGALU, with that half star thrown in because Ileana D'Cruz is simply just so hot. She reminds me quite a bit of Amrita Rao. I wouldn't mind seeing Ileana again. But I hesitate to say the same of this movie.",1224979200,,4107,5.0323529411764705
