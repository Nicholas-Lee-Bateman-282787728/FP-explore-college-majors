8722005,5,B010CG2G9E,"Van Morrison: Another Glorious Decade Under Review 1977 - 1987 (2015) is the latest installment in the massive Sexy Intellectual series of rich music documentaries MVD Visual has been distributing since day one, leaving hardly any stone unturned in telling us the thorough story of whom and whatever music subject they take on. This time, it is the fall, return and no necessarily back-to-form second round of albums from the famous singer from Them who found huge solo success with hits like Moondance.

The program, with some very smart music fans, scholars, lovers and people who worked with the artist talks about a new era of Van Morrison's work and how his persistent abrasiveness usually ruined any possibilities of commercial success. At first, the work is in line with his early best including a surprise appearance at The Band's last concert filmed by Martin Scorsese as The Last Waltz (1978), then he hit the 1980s and like most of the great artists of the 1960s and 1970s, he ran out of gas and things to say. In this case, it was explorations of tangential spirituality that made for not so great music, but releases some fans and critics loved. I disagree. His output becomes muddled, he becomes cut away from the madness of the Reagan/Thatcher Era and was never in form again. You can see this one for yourself, but it is really a highly-detailed for-fans-only affair and one of my favorites from the dozens of Under Review releases. It runs just over 90 minutes.
Extras include text Contributor Bios and at about 17 minutes long, the featurette Van Morrison & The Music Pres",1458864000,4,1590,4.802919708029197

Fans of classic rock from the late sixties, through the seventies and into the eighties will no doubt recall the music of Van Morrison. Starting first with the band Them and their hit Gloria, Morrison went on to record some of the greatest songs in rock history. But much of that happened early in his career with his classic album ASTRAL WEEKS being released in 1968 and MOONDANCE in 1970. While those are the biggest memories most will have there was more to come from Morrison and this documentary focuses on those later years.

After surviving a huge tour and then going through a terrible divorce, Morrison came off the road unsure of what to do next. He recorded several albums and then seemed to disappear, taking three years off from the music business. Three years in that business is a lifetime and Morrison had the possibility of losing his entire career in doing so. Instead he came back full force creating more albums that featured some amazing songs and offered some of the most heartfelt vocals of his career. The sales didn't equal that of what hed done before and the critics weren't near as kind this time around, but as time has passed an appreciation for those albums and the music he made have shown that theyve lasted much longer than many of those same critics.

Biographical documentaries tend to take several paths. The best will use a combination of interviews with people involved as well as the subject and mix them with both live performances and backstage moments to offer a clear view of the person being discussed. Another is to simply show that person onstage performing with an occasional aside to show information about that person. This documentary chooses to take the road less taken, combining news footage and interviews with Morrison rather than speak to him directly, short clips of performances (my best guess is that complete performances couldn't be licensed from those who own them) and interviews with critics, commentators and past associates.

The end result is a DVD that will hold your interest for a while but as it goes on becomes a tad boring seeing the same talking heads over and over. But not to worry since intermingled are those scenes of Morrison actually performing. The good thing is that in watching this you begin to remember those songs he sang, the ones that weren't megahits but that were actually pretty good. Hearing them brings back memories and makes you want to dig out those albums or CDs to give them a good listen to once again. And in the end isn't that one of the main goals when making a movie about a singer/songwriter, to get you to not just remember who they were but to appreciate what it was they did?

Various albums and their creation are discussed at length here as are the people that performed with Morrison on those albums. His quirks aren't glossed over and his battle with the press is even discussed. The vision of an artists is almost always misunderstood by some and thats the case with many of Morrisons recordings when they were first released. It wasn't until later when going back that they were fully appreciated. This DVD helps make that clear.

Fans of Morrison will want to add this to their collection because of the subject matter. Fans of the music from the time period will want to give it a watch. And if you want to be inspired to go back and search through your record collection then by all means watch this and start thumbing through your collection.",1443484800,8,3517,4.68284789644013
8722007,5,B010CG2G9E,"although i haven't received my copy yet of 'another glorious decade', i have owned part 1, 'a glorious decade' for quite some time, and have watched it over and over again...

and it bears mentioning...this is not for someone who just wants to hear van do 'moondance'...this is for musicians and songwriters and people who really know the music industry to listen to 'talking heads' from the music industry (mostly those from england and europe), who some 'ignorant americans' sometimes refer to as 'nobodys', just because they never heard of them before...yet most of them are the most respected names in the music industry...

now...if you are one of those who reads the liner notes on the back of the album covers (or the inner sleeve of the cd), then the first part, and i'm sure this part, will be for you...",1442448000,3,813,4.71830985915493
