The techiniques and information will help you get started, and the video is professionally shot, with helpful camera angles.  If you have been scratching for a while, you can still learn some really nice techniques, and tips, and any professional should be looking for ways to improve his or her art.

I am waiting for the next and more advanced series which are in the works.

This is well worth the price!",1285545600,4,505,4.456521739130435

The videos cover everything i could ask for, the go trough all parts in the tattoo machine, explain in great detail all supplies needed and how to use them .
Then i got into the tattoo part of the videos, the videos clearly show and demonstate the proper way of doing things.

one of the videos was had a little back round noise, but nothing that is going to interfere with the video.

I would highly suggest these videos to anyone who wants to learn, they are the most help i have recieved so far in my training,I learned alot of little things i never knew and these videos are pretty modern, you can tell by the cool music in the one video. I have bought other videos off of ebay and these are by far the best i have ever gotten.

So thank you guys that made this, you have helped me out more then you realize.

The featured artist is not that great, the portrait artist is pretty good but doesnt really explain what he's doing or the needle sizes. It shows cover ups that I would be embarassed to show to  the public, very bad examples. The quality of the filming is terrible, they play music in the back ground so you can tell where they edited the clip because the song is in a different place. I paid 200$ for this and that is more than I paid for any of my supplies to start tattooing. I want to save you from making the same mistake. There are plenty of amazing dvds out there and this is not one of them. Im not the type to disrespect other artist but when I feel so ripped off I have to let it be known why. If I was only charged 40$ this would be ok but 200$ is robbery. So my advice to the people that made this is to lower the price or you won't sell anymore. You know that you set this price so high as a marketing strategy, you know its not because its full of amazing advice or film quality. This is just my never to be humble oppinion. Hope this saves people money in this bad economy, this is not economicaly smart investment, I learned more from getting a tattoo and youtube.",1283904000,16,1306,4.023076923076923
