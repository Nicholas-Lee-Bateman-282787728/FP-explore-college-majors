ZHTO is an attempt, however faltering, to right the history of a people who've been conquered and repressed by oh-so-righteous and clean muslims. it's a wonder the greeks didn't invite them to take over! fight cypriot idiot. that's all you know and it's just what you deserve.",1298505600,,600,4.9405940594059405
8197901,3,B000QXCZHM,"Did you know that beloved Mboumboulina slaughtered many thousands of civilians in Tripolitsa? Did you know that the rich landowners and the church officials were against the revolution? Did you know that 95% of the millions of pounds given by phillellines for the revolution were stolen by its leaders? etc., etc. Greek history is a whore and ought to be re-written.
