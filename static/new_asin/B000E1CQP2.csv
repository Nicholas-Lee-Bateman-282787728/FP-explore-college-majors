8103769,2,B000E1CQP2,"I really wanted to like this movie.  I have a strong appreciation for movies of this type and from this era so I was looking forward to it, regardless of other ratings.  However, I just couldn't get into it.  They had so much to work with but the movie never came together.  The acting was mediocre at best, the jokes were forced and the story never held interest.  Sammy and Peter are very talented and have good chemistry but this was not the vehicle to display that talent.",1395014400,2,476,4.363636363636363
8103770,3,B000E1CQP2,"If one were to judge a film solely by its title and the ""wit"" implied by it, then Salt & Pepper earns a place of honor in the cinematic vault of shame. Disappointingly, Salt & Pepper isn't a biopic of the pioneering female rap group. Rather, it's about a pair of swinging entrepreneurs, one black, one white.

Charles Salt (Sammy Davis, Jr.), a brash Yank, and Christopher Pepper (Peter Lawford), son of a Lord, are best chums and co-owners of a popular London gambling joint/night club. For whatever reason our duo sets the local constabulary's teeth on edge. Charles and Christopher find themselves constantly hassled by Inspector Crabbe (Michael Bates) of the Soho Police. The blustery Crabbe believes the club host to all manner of underhanded shenanigans. He accuses our fellas of running a ""haven for half-nude harpies."" And maybe there's something to the copper's rant, but I can't take him too serious as my eyes are pre-occupied with scoping out those topless card dealers.

Salt & Pepper (1968) is one of many to capitalize on the then current craze that was the James Bond spy spoof - think Casino Royale (1967) and those comic spy thrillers featuring James Coburn's Derek Flint and Dean Martin's Matt Helm. Salt & Pepper isn't as good as those, but it's tolerably decent. Yes, the two middle-aged leads come off as ridiculous and trying too hard to be relevant on the happening scene. They weren't close to being hip; they were closer to hip replacements. Their banter is horribly dated and, more damningly, is not funny. No, instead, what transfixed me were the improbable situations they kept getting themselves into.

Inspector Crabbe must've thought Christmas came early when a murder at the club implicates our homies. And since the bobbies come all resentful and buffoonish, our past-their-peak heroes take it upon themselves to probe into things. They're promptly entrenched in a world of cloak and dagger and eventually unearth a plot to topple the British government. Along the way, they run across a scar-faced villain, an eye-patched villain, deceitful dames, random bombs, and even a mock submarine. Oooh, and corpses, a cavalcade of them (one of whom stages a Bernie Lomax impersonation). It got so that Mr. Salt finally remarks: ""This is getting to be monotonous.""

Running at almost two hours, yup, it does feel dragged out, even though director Richard Donner tries his best to keep things moving. Still, we're given several moments to appreciate. Sammy Davis, Jr. breaks out a musical number (""I Like the Way You Dance"") and does impressions of Bogie and Cagney. Sammy Davis, Jr. was a hell of a talented entertainer - he could do everything - and he so wanted to be a huge movie star, but never really achieved it. I don't know if it's because he didn't quite have the acting chops or the sheer physical magnetism of, say, Sidney Poitier or Harry Belafonte. What can't be marginalized is what he went thru to break down racial barriers. He did his share of that. One of my favorite all-time musical films is Tap (1989). I loved him as ""Little Mo.""

An average 2.5 out of 5 stars. Some of the gags do work - like that ridiculously tricked-out yellow jalopy or the British Intelligence officer downing a slug of whiskey to prove it isn't poisoned. Like I said, what kept me watching is the string of zany scrapes our guys kept getting into. But there's also this vibe of ""Let's throw mad crap at the wall and see what sticks"" and as well this playful wink at the audience that disarmed me. Salt & Pepper fared moderately well at the box office, well enough that they made a sequel, One More Time (1970). Jerry Lewis directed it in his only non-starring directing gig. So I figure at least the French will keep the sequel going, no matter its level of suck.",1394841600,,3784,4.762195121951219
8103771,5,B000E1CQP2,"This is Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. having fun cracking jokes and solving crimes in 1968 London.
Don't miss this hilarious spy spoof!",1385164800,,139,4.833333333333333
8103772,2,B000E1CQP2,"I saw this movie in its original 1968 release in a rather bizarre double bill with Hammer's ""Island of Terror"" when I was a wee lad of nine years old.  The only reason it stuck in my mind is because it was the first movie in which I got to see a woman's naked breasts.  It was just for an instance in one of the club scenes, I think.

C.J.'s dismissive review, which alluded to the Rat Pack's fall from grace in the late '60s, is pretty accurate, although I must admit my memory of the ""Salt and Pepper"" plotline is pretty sketchy 44 years later.  The ""Mad Men"" type chauvinist lifestyle this movie celebrates somewhat was eclipsed by the Summer of Love in '67, and was marketed for middle aged hipsters trying to feel like they were a part of the sexual revolution.  Also, ""Casino Royale"" had been a big hit, and this movie tried to cash in on that trend with the James Bond touches, and the poster artwork was very reminiscent of another huge hit featuring has-been talents ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World"".

In sum, ""Salt and Pepper"" is rather derivative fluff, although it must have sold some tickets as it spawned a sequel called ""One More Time"" (directed by none other than Jerry Lewis, his only directorial effort in which he does not appear). I was tempted to watch ""Salt and Pepper"" again just for the nostalgia value, but thought better of it after reading C.J.'s review.  Probably better to let this sleeping dog lie.

P.S. Another factor in passing it by was that a few years ago I re-watched ""Island of Terror,"" the second movie on that 1968 double feature from long ago, it looked fake and ridiculous. I was amazed that I had been frightened by it, even as a boy.  I guess you can't go home again.",1354320000,,1713,4.3955696202531644
8103773,1,B000E1CQP2,I remember swinging London and it was very cool. I remember Carnaby St and Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. hardly were representative of those times. These two- chain smoking over the hill types were on the career outs (the rat pack was dead)  and this was a poor attempt to be hip. Result? This movie is just plain dumb and embarrassing. Sammy is salt and Lawford is Pepper- oh that's funny!  They're not cool- they're just 2 old geezers trying to live it up in swinging London.  The dialogue is stupid - the plot even worse.  Remember this movie was released during the time of The Beatles- The Stones- The Doors--and here we get to see Peter and Sammy wearing love beads and Nehru jackets--because they were so with it and such hip guys.  The over the hill gang rides and falls off.  Don't bother.  Want to see a rather strange movie and closer picture of the 60's?  Watch Wild in the Streets-or The Strawberry Statement.,1332979200,3,926,4.502994011976048
8103774,3,B000E1CQP2,"Salt and Pepper (1968) Groovy man! Take two members of the Rat Pack (Sammy Davis Jr and Peter Lawford), drop them into swinging London as the title guys, the coolest club owners this side of Ravi Shankar, mix them up with some spy hijinks right out of James Bond (or Matt Helm, anyway) and have the whole thing orchestrated by director Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon), and you've got the recipe for this wild comedy. Of course, Sammy is Salt and Pete's Pepper, a fairly obvious joke that gets a major workout several times over the course of the picture. But it's all in good fun, Sammy sings a couple of songs (one over the end credits) and the rest is hip humor, chases, escapes and British drollery. The supporting cast is fine, with Michael Bates (TV's Last of the Summer Wine) standing out as the police inspector who'd like to lock Salt and Pepper up because they're just too groovy. Director Donner keeps things moving, and both Davis and Lawford seem to be having a good time. If you like your movies 60's and shagadelic, you've got to check this one out! Yeah, baby!",1229212800,9,1074,4.541237113402062
