2712682,4,B000LPS3AI,"I'm not a complete fan of Alex de la Iglesia's movies - he's technically proficient, but the things that tend to interest him (old style cinephilia, terror films of the 70s, pop culture in general) are far from mine. This biting satire of consumerism, though, is probably as perfect (or ferpect) a film as he can make. The movie stars Rafael, who works as the head salesman in the ladies section of a large department store in Madrid (it is subtly touching that Rafael believes his position in society is far more important than it really is). Around him work very beautiful, model-like woman, that he never fails to bed. He's the ruler of a very small kingdom. Soon, a job opens for one of the top posts in the department store, and he founds himself fighting for the promotion against the balding Don Antonio, one of the old-fashioned vendors in the men' section. Rafael accidentally kills him, and after wards disposes of the body. But there is one witness, Lourdes, the ugliest worker in the department store (and I mean, really ugly), who is in love with Rafael. She's also something of a psycho, has a really crazy family and she will then proceed to blackmail Rafael into marrying her in order not to blow the whistle about the murder; a nightmare for the consummate ladies man that is Rafael. The last 20 minutes are something of a letdown (De la Iglesia probably didn't knew how to end the story, since a tragic ending would be out of line with the farcical tone of the movie before), but overall this is a surprisingly strong, entertaining movie, that is also hilariously critical of capitalism.",1197072000,,1605,4.654929577464789
2712683,5,B000LPS3AI,"I'm so happy this DVD is available in region 1 format.  I knew if I waited long enough, it would become available. I saw this movie at the Phila Film Festival the year it came out, and I was totally blown away. I am not an ""out loud"" laugher, but I was rolling in the aisles, laughing my head off.  I highly recommend this sick, hilarious movie.  Puts most American comedies to shame.",1195430400,,384,4.232876712328767
2712684,2,B000LPS3AI,"A disappointing black comedy/slapstick farce from Spain.  This could have been so much better if only they'd injected even an iota of subtlety into the film, but as it is, it's all very in-your-face and overly obvious.

It begins with promise: a suave, arrogantly self-confident department store salesman tells us (in voiceover narration, always a bad sign...) of his plans to ascend to the glorious heights of floor manager, once he vanquishes his nerdy nemesis, the head of the men's clothing department.  Along the way we are seduced by his casual amorality, flirting with and bedding all the women working in his department.  All but one, that is: a stray 'ugly girl' is in the flock, and she has her eyes on him.  When murder enters into the picture, so does blackmail, and soon she has him over a barrel, and once his perfect world is undone, he goes mad.  Not slowly, mind you, but in the blink of an eye, at the same manic pace as everything else in this film.

This is a grating, dark, ""War Of The Roses""-ish comedy, which sneers at and nakedly mocks all its characters, showing humanity at its worst.  That would be all well and fine, if the filmmakers had something more substantive to pin their contempt on... But the savage depictation of consumer culture shown in the seething hordes that shop at the store has no depth -- it's as simplistic and hurried as everything else in this movie. Facile, mean-spirited and ultimately tiresome, this is not a film I would recommend.",1183680000,,1486,4.688461538461539
2712685,5,B000LPS3AI,"The movie per se is entertaining and original and fun to watch. It is almost never dull, it is always keeping you on the edge of your seat to see what will happen next and all is done precisely and cleverly. This is a great film to see in class or with your friends or girl-friend, it's all good n fun -black humour- that adds the right stuff to this perfect production.

On that note:
The majority of the Spanish-girls (of Spain) in this film are flawless and erotic, be warn, the first 30mins of this film entices you with beauty, greed and sex. Afterwards, it gets more philosophical, sadistic and pensive. Moreover the film tends to be a monologue of Rafael's triumphs, misfortunes and schemes.

On the plus side, this film will make you want to go to Spain....heheh

Anyhow,

10/10 = A+",1174089600,3,791,4.472222222222222
2712706,5,B000LPS3AI,This is an excellent movie.  Very funny!  I saw it during it's theatrical release and then decided to own a copy.,1355702400,,113,4.333333333333333
2712707,5,B000LPS3AI,"Been a fan of Alex de la Iglesia since Accion Mutante! Even if he's being more mainstream, the film is still wicked funny,  always slightly demented and well paced with some inspired performances. Certainly held my interest and I would watch it again with no problem.",1342656000,,267,4.804347826086956
2712708,5,B000LPS3AI,"I cannot recommend it enough to those who like something refreshingly different in comedy which turns  dark and takes all kinds of twists and turns throughout. Don Antonio's ghoulish ghost who accompanies Rafael in the second part of the movie is absolutely hysterical. Even smaller parts like the table scene when Rafael goes to Lourdes' home for dinner is a must see with neurotic mom, dad who just can't anymore and sleeps sitting up to escape the family dysfunction, and the little sister who will declare anything for shock value to make mamma pass out in front of their guest. Every little part of the film has something incredibly funny. You will laugh 'til you howl.",1323648000,,674,4.810344827586207

2712711,5,B000LPS3AI,"We'd seen the trailer for ""The Perfect Crime"" when this was in the theaters.  We passed it by then and saved it for DVD.  Now, I'm kicking myself for not seeing it in the theater.  Oh, how the US trailer misleads you on this black, black, blackest of comedies.  The Spanish trailer nails the dark essence of the film; the US trailer tried to pass it off as lighter fare.  Don't believe it: rent or buy this movie as soon as you possibly can and revel in twisted vision of writer/director (and producer!) lex de la Iglesia.

Star Guillermo Toledo is awesome here - his swagger and brio at the film' outset and well into the first hour is breathtaking.  You're taken aback when you find out that this man who you think must be at the pinnacle of his profession is, in fact, manager of the women's clothes department at Yeyo's (a Macy's-like entity).  But that's just it: de la Iglesia's direction and take is that Guillermo's Rafael_is_ at the peak.  And why wouldn't you think that when you're surrounded by Spain's most beautiful actresses like Penlope Velasco, Kira Mir and Montserrat Mostaza as your adoring staff?

But, oh, how Rafa's life takes a turn for the worse.  An unfortunate turn of events and an even more unfortunate (for Rafa's sake) witness to those events (in the form of a outstanding performance by Mnica Cervera) serve to bring his highly confident days to a slow and crushing end.

Though the film changes dramatically from beginning to end, the one constant is the excellence of Guillermo Toledo.  It's an astounding performance.  I can't recommend this movie highly enough.

Oh - let me be another to add that the movie loses a bit in the translation of the title to English: the original Spanish language release is ""El Crimen Ferpecto"" - note the transposed 'f' and 'p'.  It's a joke within the movie - Rafael is renting the Spanish-dubbed release of the 1928 film (""The Perfect Crime"" - the real one!) and the register rings up the film with the incorrect name.  Guillermo is so deranged at the time (he's spiraling down pretty good at that point) that the error drives him to distraction.",1246924800,,2115,4.627345844504021
2712712,5,B000LPS3AI,La vi la primera vez en la HBO latino. Me enamore de ella. Esta pelicula me tenia riendo desde el principio hasta el fin. Los actores tienen accentos castellanos entonces para algunos queda un poco dificil entender lo que dicen los actores. Para mi entendia. Me encantan las comedias negras porque son honestas y poco politicalmente correctas; esta peli' no es differente. Es brillante!!!,1244246400,,388,5.078125

2712714,4,B000LPS3AI,"I caught this movie once, just by chance, on Showtime and I wanted to buy it right then and there.

Highly recommend this movie.",1227657600,,211,4.25
2712715,5,B000LPS3AI,"I see the packagers have ""fixed"" the title of this movie since I saw it at a film festival several years ago. Then, it was ""El Crimen Ferpecto"" in Spanish, which I guess would translate as ""The Ferpect Crime"" -- a much more expressive and suitable name for this hilarious film.

Rafael (Guillermo Toledo) has everything he wants -- looks, confidence, a terrific job managing the women's department of the trendy Yeyo department store, the feeling that the rules don't apply to him, and lots of gorgeous coworkers willing to play after hours -- except the top job for which he is competing with Don Antonio (Luis Varela). Comes the showdown, and Rafael is sure he's got the job -- but it goes to Don Antonio! Worse, Rafael loses his temper and Don Antonio fires him, and during a furious argument back in the changing rooms, Rafael accidentally kills his new ex-boss!

Although Rafael manages to dodge immediate suspicion for the crime, he not only fails to dispose of the body (it disappears on him!) but somebody witnessed the death, and that person is ready to blackmail him into . . . marriage? Don Antonio keeps coming back as a severed head or green corpse with a butcher knife embedded in his skull to advise and commiserate with Rafael. Gradually, Inspector Campoy (Enrique Villen) guesses what's going on -- or part of it, anyway. Toledo looks a bit like Dennis Miller doing a John Cleese steadily going crazy.",1209686400,,1418,4.713709677419355

8163571,5,B000LPS3AI,"Watched this DVD many times and learned more and more about the plot and never tire of seeing it again and again, you too will enjoy it and note the title is Crimen Ferpecto (Perfect Crime) which Perfecto was deliberately not spelled correctly and understand why this film did that. The star of the movie seems to be the man who is competing with another male employee to be the floor manager, but the saleswomen who is homely and un-noticed at first becomes the star herself and you will understand half way through the film much to your delight, you will laugh  aloud, guarateed!
