8756765,5,B01DRYRUO4,"This is one of Andre's best concerts. Very spectacular and dramatic.  If you have seen some of Andre's big pieces like Conquest of Paradise an/or O Fortune from Carmina Burana on youTube you probably saw part of this concert.  Several hundred performers from full male chorus, waltz dancers, ice skaters dancing waltzes to bagpipers and drums. Some humor also. The background was a recreation of the castle in a Vienna where Andre performed in another concert. He has used this full sized staging in Australia too. You can not ask for more.
If you were not one of the lucky ones to be there in person then that would be a disappointment. Not the DVD.
Picture was as clear as a DVD can be. Surround sound great. Sound puts you in the audience. I watched on a 65 inch 4K television and it was fabulous.
If you like or love Andre Rieu then this is for you to enjoy.
CON: A little too much talking and fast pans at the beginning only. Rest perfect. Will play on US blue ray players or DVD.",1499644800,,985,4.377049180327869
