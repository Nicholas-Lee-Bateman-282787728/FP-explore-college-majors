6877093,1,B00QMWEIZS,"I am kicking myself on this one. I didn't even THINK to look to see if this was a Columbia Pictures release or not. I just assumed. Unfortunately, they farmed this ""double feature"" out to Mill Creek. Mill Creek is known for putting out cheap junk, and this release follows their pattern. These two movies are BOTH overly compressed, and the resulting picture is terrible. I imagine it might be tolerable on a laptop or a portable DVD player....but on an 40"" LED TV? Awful.

Spend the extra bucks and get the individual releases. Don't be a sucker like me and pay good money to Mill Creek for this junk.",1427846400,19,602,4.472727272727273
6877094,2,B00QMWEIZS,"I was going to wait on my review since I only just started watching the delightful Owl & the Pussycat.  50 minutes in I decided to preview the other feature, For Pete's Sake, and noticed they both have the same problem. Over compression.

I looked on the back of the case to see if the Mill Creek label would come off and underneath would be the Echo Bridge label since I've had way more problems with them for this very issue.  MC is usually pretty good with their releases.  But not here.  I'm surprised no one else noticed this enough to mention it.

I stopped getting satellite dish TV 10 years ago for this very reason (along with promos being played over TV shows).  I would have gladly paid a few more dollars for these films on their own DVDs.  I know eventually we'll get blu rays of these and I'll have to rebuy them.

As for the films, not sure on the second feature but Owl is terrific (up to 50 minutes so far). I suspect I'll have a ball with both these regardless.  But I did feel it deserved a warning to others.",1425081600,15,1028,4.225641025641026
6877095,5,B00QMWEIZS,"Even if you don't watch ""For Pete's Sake"" (which is pretty funny, too), the DVD is worth the price for ""The Owl and the Pussycat."" Barbra Streisand and George Segal are great together. Watching this again for the first time since the 80's, I am reminded what a great comic actress is Ms. Streisand. Her rapid fire delivery is hilarious and her moments of empathy make for a fairly well-rounded character. These two people are awfully funny and sexy together. I'm glad I watched it again!",1424044800,3,487,4.674418604651163
6877096,3,B00QMWEIZS,"It's not the uncensored original release version, but the same old PG version Columbia has used for years.  They kill one of the funniest bits in the film by this idiotic cut.  These days, who cares whether a 40 year old movie is rated PG or R?  The original cut deserves 5 stars this gets 3.",1422921600,35,292,4.178571428571429
6877097,1,B00QMWEIZS,Let's hope that Owl & the Pussycat is the uncensored version.,1420675200,7,61,4.636363636363637

6877099,1,B00QMWEIZS,"Review is for the Mill Creek release. Quality of films are very poor, felt like we were watching on a cheap cable access channel. Owl and the Pussycat is the horribly edited PG version. This set is not worth owning by any sense of the imagination.",1503187200,4,247,4.391304347826087

6877101,3,B00QMWEIZS,"No Streisand movie will ever get more than four stars from me. Both of these movies were good movies that would have been much better with some other actress in the lead role. Babs is a lousy actress and her speaking voice is grating. I took off an additional star primarily for the editing of The Owl and the Pussycat, and also for the over-compression. Neither movie is worth being offered in blu-ray, but I would buy The Owl and the Pussycat for the right price on blu-ray if they would offer it unedited.",1496448000,,508,4.414893617021277
6877102,3,B00QMWEIZS,I only watched For Pete's Sake and I had seen it before and I still laugh when I watch it. I started to watch the Owe and the pussycat but it was my kind of movie.  I have enjoyed all the DVDs I have ordered from you. Thanks,1495843200,,224,3.6666666666666665

6877116,1,B00QMWEIZS,"The film quality is awful.  It continually jumps like pieces are missing. This was the movie ""For Pete's Sake"".

6877117,4,B00QMWEIZS,"This ""Owl and the Pussycat"" debate over a cut/dubbed word.. In the R-rated 1970 film release Streisand and Segal are walking down the street and being followed by thugs. Babs tells them to F*** off. She was trying to change her image and this probably the only reason it got an R rating for this word . In the VHS and DVD releases she says ""Buzz off"". This is the only difference in the entire film. I guess for purists this is a problem. The movie is a comedy gem, enjoy.",1472860800,,472,4.197802197802198

8692024,5,B00QMWEIZS,"This is a review of the Mill Creek Entertainment ""Owl And The Pussycat"" and ""For Pete's Sake"" Barbra Streisand double-feature on one disc.

These two movies were big audience-pleasers in their day and it's nice that they are available in some form.  We can only hope that there will someday be remastered Blu-Ray versions of them.  They are each presented in their correct aspect ratios on this DVD.

Unfortunately, Mill Creek Entertainment provides low-resolution, high-compression for this DVD.  It is truly a shame because the theatrical prints looked magnificent and remastered versions on a high-quality DVD or Blu-Ray could be gorgeous.  It is hard to imagine that Barbra Streisand would want her fine work to be presented this way.  Perhaps someone else has complete control of the rights... it is hard to understand.

So buy this double-feature version for the content until such time as a better version becomes available.

Therefore the ""star"" rating on this review is for the quality of the original movies, but not for the Mill Creek Entertainment DVD technical quality.

These movies, especially The Owl And The Pussycat, would be great candidates for the full, beautiful Criterion Collection treatment.  If anybody from Criterion Collection reads this, please think about it!",1512864000,3,1289,5.239024390243903
