7952402,3,B00005RIXB,"FUNimation's DVDs keep getting a little better every time. There are still a few noticeable pauses between some tracks, like between the theme song and the recap, and between the title sequence and the beginning of the episode. And still, no preview of the next episode in Japanese, either. But, they've included the original eyecatches, so there are signs of improvement. Also, the animated menus look NICE this time around. Unlike the cruddy screen captures from the Freeza discs, the Cell menus feature a cool-looking techno-organic cell floating around in green embryonic fluid.
Only three episodes on the disc, but that's no surprise. The Powers That Be have already long since decided that we stupid consumers are to digest this 300-episode series in installments of 3 episodes per ... disc. The first two episodes on the disc really aren't more than a buildup that goes on a little too long. Nothing much here except setting up Cell's appearance and Piccolo's power-up. The third episode is the real meat and potatoes of the disc, with Piccolo and Cell going at it. From the horrific images of Cell killing his victims to Piccolo's superpowered martial arts prowess, this episode is one to remember out of the entire DBZ series.",1012348800,2,1235,4.971014492753623
7952403,4,B00005RIXB,"This is the beginning of the Cell saga. It isn't the best video but it is a need to know so you understand the Cell battle. However, you have to have watched the android saga to get the whole idea. The best part of the video is where Piccolo comes to fight Cell for the first time since he joined with Kami. This is also a lot better if it is uncut because you get to see more action etc. which you won't see on cartoon network and that spoils DBZ really because it isn't meant to be a childrens cartoon and it is extremely violent. This is the build up to the major final battle!",982627200,2,580,4.008620689655173
7952404,5,B00005RIXB,"Perhaps the best saga ever made has finally come! To make it short, I'll tell you about the good stuff. Trunks & Gohan discover Cell's egg, then  his transport body, & the time machine thatCell stole from Trunks. Oh  yeah, kame joins with Piccolo. In the next episode, Piccolo goes down &  meets Cell. They show him suck a fat guy up. Pretty cool if you ask me! And  it becomes a battle where Cell uses the Special Beam Cannon, & the  wicked kamehamema. Then, the military gets involved which is quite funny.  Oh, & the androids, they are still on the road.",967852800,10,557,4.359223300970874
