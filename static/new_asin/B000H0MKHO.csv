2625129,3,B000H0MKHO,"the DVD practice offers two 35 minutes practices, the first covers basic poses like down facing dog, warrior positions and a few hip twists; the second is more to relax and release stress from the body that uses a lot of props like 2X blankets, blocks and a wall.  In addition, there are two 10-min guided practices: meditation and relaxation, which i wished both were longer.

Both 35 minutes session were very gentle and instructions were clear.  If you are particularly new to yoga, I think you will enjoy this DVD. I store a lot of stress in my upper body and found this dvd useful, but not targeted for my specific needs.  However, I still got a lot out of using the DVD and still felt the release; but I do need to supplement this dvd with a more targeted stress reliever for particulary bad days.

I recommend this dvd to learn about breathing, which is absolutely critical for any yoga practice and the ability to relax, which this dvd does address.",1224633600,12,957,4.508670520231214
2625130,5,B000H0MKHO,"I took a yoga class three years ago, and have recently started practicing again.  I think this DVD is great for beginners.  Dr. Baxter Bell (the narrator) guides the viewer through various poses aimed at reducing and eliminating stress.  One model performs the poses at a more intermediate level, another at a very beginner level (or someone who is not yet flexible), that way you have a visual aide depending on your level of practice or flexibility.  One practice is for stress relieving, another for stress prevention.  Both routines are very different from each other.  There is also a timer so that you can pause the program to stay in a certain position for 2, 5, or 10 minutes.  You will need a mat, block, strap, bolster (I use a couch cushion!), and 2 blankets.  It seems like a lot to purchase, but you'll use them a lot - it's a worth while investment to your health!

There is also a segment on Pranayama breathing (deep, restorative breathing), guided relaxation, and guided meditation.  The only thing that annoys me - and it only bugs me a little - is that the same acoustic guitar music is used throughout all the programs!  I prefer music like a Native American flute or something more New Age. Other than that, I think this video would be excellent for someone who has some familiarity with the very basic positions.",1224201600,2,1334,4.634042553191489
2625131,5,B000H0MKHO,"In order to manage stress through mindfulness, Dr. Baxter Bell presents two practices. The first focuses on energizing poses and the second focuses on calming the nervous system. If you are interested in avoiding stress related illnesses then you might enjoy one or both of the 30-minute practice sessions. In the first session you may recognize:

Practice 1

Mountain Pose
Mini Sun Salutes
Standing Forward Bend
Lunges
Downward Facing Dog
Chair Pose
Locust Pose
Warrior II
Tree Pose
Side Angle Pose
Wide-Legged Forward Standing Bend
Cobbler's Pose
Boat Pose
Half King of the Fishes Pose
Modified Bridge
Final Relaxation Pose (skip this is you want to continue for 60 minutes)

While doing the postures it is helpful to have a block or a set of pillows.

Practice 2

Dr. Baxter Bell's pleasant narration leads you through the poses with some creative visualizations. In the second practice there are lots of stretches and they are held for just the right amount of time. Some of the postures/poses include:

Mountain Pose
Shoulder Raises
Eagle Arms (great for tight shoulders)
Standing Forward Bend
Wide-Legged Forward Standing Bend
Downward Facing Dog
Supported Child's Pose
Spinal Twist
Queen's Pose
Final Relaxation

For the most part this DVD presents exercises that calm and nourish. With the use of blankets and pillows this becomes a gentle yoga practice. If you put both practices together you can exercise for 60 minutes. Since I did this workout before an interview it gave me a chance to see if it really was able to reduce stress. I feel that this yoga DVD also gave me a clear mind and I felt relaxed and healed. I can recommend this to beginners and intermediates who are seeking a stress reduction program.

This DVD also contains a section on breathing exercise a guided relaxation and a guided meditation. For Christians I'd skip the guided meditation as it seems to contain some beliefs from the Hindu religion. I don't want to open my mind to other gods.

2625132,5,B000H0MKHO,I highly recommend this DVD. I really worked up a sweat and could really feel my muscles working. The 5 and 8 minute relaxing segments are very nice. I think they would be great done at night before bed time.,1183420800,,208,4.225
2625133,2,B000H0MKHO,"For a Yoga DVD that is supposed to help reduce stress, I thought the

routines in this one were too fast-paced. There is a strange pause

feature that is completely useless in practice.  The Body Wisdom Yoga

for stress DVD is much better, at least in my opinion.",1178928000,6,263,4.416666666666667
2625134,5,B000H0MKHO,This yoga tape is designed for someone who is new to yoga.  Dr. Baxter Bell does throughly explain proper form and the benefits.  My only complaint is that the music isn't very relaxing and I felt like I was in a classroom setting with his tone of voice.  I would probably recommend this for the man in your house who is resistant to trying yoga.,1173571200,4,346,4.292307692307692
2625135,5,B000H0MKHO,"I bought this DVD a while back and didn't think much of it because it had so much verbal instruction during the practice. I then realized there is an alternate practice mode that uses less verbal instruction once you've learned the routine and/or know a bit about yoga already. You can easily switch from one mode to another if you have an audio button on your DVD controller. If you're new to yoga this would be a great instructional video. I use the version with just the queues, it's great!

It has some lovely, relaxing music and Dr. Bell's voice is very soothing and relaxing. The whole practice is very restorative and refreshing.

Also, there is a cool yoga timer built into the practice. You need to have a top menu button on your DVD controller and when you press it you can hold a pose for 2, 5, or 10 minutes and then the practice continues. If you practice Yin Yoga this is a great option! You can go very deep into the postures.

There are two practices, each run 35 minutes. You can do either one separate or together. Stress prevention is a bit more active and stress relief practice is very restorative & relaxing. He uses props like blocks, bolsters, and straps, but you could get away with not using those items.

The stress prevention workout starts with a slow meditative sun salutation series, then on to warrior, tree, wide leg forward bend with a twist, cobbler, boat, seated twists, bridge, and more. What makes this practice different than other DVDs is he holds the poses for a long enough time that you feel it. It might be considered too slow moving if you like fast moving power yoga. There is time in between postures to settle in and feel your body. There is also a froggie version of downward facing dog that my bull dog and I really enjoyed, ribbit ;o)

There are also 3 short practices covering breathing, relaxation, and meditation.

This is a good DVD and I highly recommend it. The audio option and timer are great additions to this DVD which I have not seen on other productions. The more I use this DVD, the more I like it. Check my other DVD review on Amazon. Namaste'",1168473600,35,2108,4.4765625
2625136,5,B000H0MKHO,"I really liked it and I like the Yoga Journal Magazine too.  Their attention to beginners helped me, even though not a beginner, remind me of the core yoga moves and how to do them well.  Very good DVD overall.",1163289600,5,210,4.225
8135715,4,B000H0MKHO,"It's very simple exercises that are very relaxing but if you're looking for exercise type of stress yoga, that's not it. It's very mild, and probably good for people with injuries. I'm not a person who likes crazy weight loss yoga or anything like that. I actually prefer mild styles but this DVD doesn't provide much of a work out if you're already somewhat familiar with yoga practices.",1493337600,,388,4.720588235294118

8135721,2,B000H0MKHO,I wanted to start practicing yoga and thought this would be a good DVD to start with. It really isn't for a beginner as the pace is a little too fast and there are really no instructions on the poses. It seems like you have to already know some poses to be able to follow along with the instructor.,1390089600,,298,4.067796610169491

8135723,5,B000H0MKHO,"I had gotten this DVD free as a giveaway at a conference, and threw it in a pile of other DVD's under my TV.  It sat there for a year or so and I forgot I had it.  Then last summer I got serious stress symptoms with a very elevated cortisol level and  panic attacks.  My doctor gave me tranquilizers which I was reluctant to take, but felt desperate.  By serendipity I came across this DVD and decided to try it to see if it would help.  I alternated the routines, trying to do one each day for a few weeks.  I gradually started feeling better and after a few weeks my cortisol level had gone down enough that I no longer felt jittery all the time.  I had done yoga in the past and this restarted my interest and I have been trying to do some every day.  I really like the tone and the two practices.  (I haven't used the breathing much.) I credit this DVD for lowering my need for medication and nudging me toward better health.  If Baxter Bell does another DVD on this subject I will likely buy it.  Some people commented on his using too many  words, but I like what he has too say, and even after using it many times do not find the commentary annoying.",1268697600,,1157,4.111607142857143
