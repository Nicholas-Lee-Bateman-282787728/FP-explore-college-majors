2291662,5,B0009I8PHI,"Carlos Kleiber's conducting once made his Vienna performance of Rosenkavalier, his first released on DVD, the preferred DVD of the opera.  It has an inner glow and musicality hard to resist. It is mellow but never slacks. Perhaps it has a melancholy edge, but it does not exploit sentiment. The many thematic references (quasi leitmotivs) in the score are always structurally cogent, conducted as to be clearly and easily grasped without underlining, never losing momentum and flow. The Wiener Staatsoper Orchestra (outside the pit known as the Vienna Philharmonic) clearly return the love with which they are conducted. One could speculate that Kleiber fashioned this performance mindful of the Marschallin throughout, though the central character is indeed the Rosenkavalier. And in von Otter, it boasted THE Octavian of her generation. This veiled valedictory (never maudling) tone is not unique to Kleiber, and certainly not a misconception; it is a distinctive characteristic of this performance.

HOWEVER..... now we have a new DVD of a Munich performance fifteen years earlier, and, as it happens, Kleiber's strongest competition turns out to be his younger self. Munich gives us faster, more incisive tempos (indeed, the performance is 7 minutes shorter). It is lively and rambunctious though always executed with the clarity and structural cogency found in the Vienna performance as noted above. If Vienna is in the spirit of the Marschallin, Munich embodies Octavian, who, after all, is young, happy, in love, and the character after whom the opera is named. And in Brigitte Fassbaender it has THE prime exponent of the part in the post-Christa Ludwig era.

So, where do we come out? The direction for both performances is by Otto Schenk (though Vienna is a revival of Schenk's original by somebody else). Anyway, it has not varied much in fifteen years. Munich seems fresher, more alert, indeed happier, mirroring Kleiber's more extrovert conception. The Munich voices are all bigger and in excellent shape.  Gwyneth Jones, a superb actress, then reigning queen at Bayreuth and without the unsteadiness which could occassionally creep into her powerful instrument, gives here, as the Marschallin one of the most subtle, colorful and moving performances of her career, one that has included roles such as all Brunnhildes, Sieglinde, Isolde, Ortrud, Aida, Cherubini's Medea and Strauss's Helen. Felicity Lott's intelligence and thorough professionalism are no match for the sum of qualities, including vocal richness, Jones brings to the part. Barbara Bonney is a charming, vocally secure, sweet Sophie in Vienna, but, again, no match for the vocal prowess, communicative skills, the sheer musical joy conveyed by Lucia Popp as Sophie in Munich(note: before her untimely and shockingly sudden death a handful of years ago, Popp had already graduated to the Marschallin, the same leap taken by Schwarzkopf many years before).  Octavian is Brigitte Fassbaender, a wonderful actress with a distinctive, powerful voice (a Fricka, a Brangaene) who exhuberantly embodies the raging hormones of our barely post-adolescent hero.  As artists, von Otter and Fassbaender are more evenly matched than the others mentioned, though their approaches to Octavian are different: both are aristocratic, wilfull, elegant, clearly in love with love, von Otter is funnier, Fassbaender is lustier (the bigger, darker,  more colorful voice helps). I have seen quite a few Octavians on stage, starting with Christa Ludwig in the sixties, all of them very good, but, after Ludwig, none better than the two ladies  here. Kurt Moll is a wonderful Ochs, vocally splendid throughout, quite well suited to Kleiber's overall conception in Vienna. On the other hand, in this part I prefer the vocal brilliance and stage magnetism of Manfred Jungwirth (though, unlike Moll, to my knowledge he never was a Gurnemanz, a  Marke, a Zarastro) . The Italian tenor in Munich is Francisco Araiza at the start of his career. For the record, I was fortunate to see Kleiber conduct Rosenkavalier at the Met, in a different production, but with virtually the same cast as in the Vienna DVD.

So, if one loves the opera and has the means, why choose? There are enough differences to appreciate each performance on its own terms and both will give much pleasure. Get both. If there are other priorities and one has to choose, I'd go for Munich.  The strengths are palpable from the pit to the kinder in the final act.  Whatever you do, one can't go wrong with either of Kleiber's performances.

I can think of no conductor I have ever enjoyed watching conduct more than Kleiber, live or on DVD. Apart from the awesome interpretative values he brought to his performances, his joy in making music was exhilarating and contagious. Without detracting from stage business, both DVD's give us ample shots of orchestra and conductor.",1136073600,103,4889,5.2127388535031844

2291685,5,B0009I8PHI,"Say what you will about the wobble, the scoops and whoops, and the breath every other note, there was never a more committed singing actress to her role than Dame Gwyneth Jones. Whether live, on video or sound recording, you can't take your eyes (or ears) off her. She is always engaging, always in command of the scene, but never overshadowing her colleagues when it is their turn to shine. Of course, it helps when you have such a stellar cast along side you: Brigitte Fassbaender, Lucia Popp, Manfred Junwirth, and of course, the incomparable Carlos Kleiber conducting the whole shebang. But, for me, this DVD is all about Gwyneth. The final trio never fails to bring tears to my eyes. Others have quite accurately analyzed the singers, the orchestra, the sets, etc., perfectly well, so I can only repeat: I love Gwyneth!",1400716800,5,824,4.769230769230769
2291686,5,B0009I8PHI,"My favorite opera, in spite of the fact that Strauss is not actually my favorite composer of opera, but the fact is if I was only allowed to see one opera for the rest of my life it would be Der Rosenkavelier, and in particular, this production.

First, the sets are magnificent. Lush, in the first act in the Marschallin's bedchamber, opulent, almost to the point of garish, in Faninal's mansion in the second act, to downright sleazy in the final act.

Second, the cast. Gwyneth Jones, plays the Marschallin with such grace and dignity, it's almost hard to remember she's also my favorite, strident Brunhilde. The late great Lucia Popp is a magnificent and totally believable Sophie, in spite of her being, I believe, forty when this was filmed. Equally believable as the virile youngster Octavian, Count Rofrano, is Brigitte Fassbaender. Manfred Jungwirth plays the buffoon, Ochs, brilliantly. Altogether a wonderful cast.

Finally, the music is brilliantly interpreted by Kleiber, perfect tempos, and somehow has injected the humor and pathos into the music.

Highly recommended.",1373414400,3,1083,5.136363636363637
2291687,5,B0009I8PHI,"I own both Carlos Kleiber DVDs of this work, and watched the 1994 first.
The most striking aspect of the 1994 DVD is the totally elegant conducting of a mature Kleiber.  He seemed to be absolutely in love with the score, and conducted the performance as if caressing a piece of art.
In this 1979 performance 15 years earlier, we see a much younger Kleiber conducting this piece with verve and energy, and most importantly, utter joy and elan.
This youthful vitality is fully reflected in the performance on stage, too.
If the 1994 version has a more sophisticated Baron Ochs (Kurt Moll, no less) and mature Marshallin (Felicity Lott), the 1979 Marshallin is the younger looking and more beautiful Gywneth Jones.  I have always tended to love visually beautiful Marshallins.  Afterall, what makes a 17-year-old boy fall in love with if not an extraordinarily beautiful mature woman?  For this reason alone, my preference is for Jones over Lott by a mile.
As for the Kavalier himself, I also prefer Fassbaender's more impetuous, livlier and fuller sounding Octavian. While von Otter is tall and slender and cuts an elegant figure in period costumes, Fassbaender creates an impression of good physical built (by virtue of her long legs, I believe) and her wonderfully boyish demeanour that von Otter some how lacks.  Fassbeander is also more at home with the 'period' movements of the young male nobility, an attribute that goes towards dramatic alertness.
There is really no need to go further for comparisons with the 1994 DVD, but I would, just for the sake of completeness, mention that Kurt Moll is a better Ochs, while Bonney is a younger and better looking, if not vocally and dramatically superior, Sophie.
For other singing roles, it is worth mentioning that Hawaiian tenor Keith Ikaia-Purdy is the 1994 Italian Singer at the start of his operatic career, while Francisco Araiza was the Singer in the 1979 performance. This role calls for great singing, so much so that Pavarotti, Kaufmann et al also sung this small but significantly demanding role. Needless to say, while I did not pay attention at all to this role in the 1994 version, the 1979 Italian Singer is fully on par with the other 'great singers' mentioned above.
The sets of the 1979 version are far superior to the 1994 version.",1364860800,3,2299,4.869565217391305
2291688,5,B0009I8PHI,"A richly satisfying production, visually and vocally.  Fassbaender, Jones, and Popp make a wonderful combination; the men perhaps a little less so, but never less than satisfactory.  Kleiber's reading really top drawer.  If you're looking for a traditional, conventional standard production, this will fulfill that role.",1267833600,3,320,5.913043478260869
2291689,5,B0009I8PHI,"Prepare to be blown away. Carlos Kleiber strides triumphantly into the pit, gleaming with self-confidence and ability. He is a man on a mission, namely to do full justice to a towering masterwork. The atmosphere is electric. Without so much as waiting for the thundering applause to die down, he launches full-force into the overture, taking it at breakneck speed.

To my mind, this overture is about great sex, climaxing together, then afterglow and intimacy. The music describes all this; First the horns thrusting, their theme received by the string section, then the two blend together and fall mutually to earth, melting with knowledge of each other. As the curtain rises, Strauss even paints the sun coming up, with birds twittering in the background, as the couple, in bed, flush with love, talk sweet nothings.

The cast simply could not be better, with Gwynneth Jones every inch the noble and melancholy Marschallin, Brigitte Faessbender the embodiment of burgeoning male sexuality, and the late, great Lucia Popp ideal with her silver voice as Sophie. Ochs retains his humanity despite being the pompous fool that he is. Top notch on every level.",1215648000,29,1156,5.078947368421052
2291690,5,B0009I8PHI,"Not just THE trio, the one in the finale, but the trio of singers as well. Ms. Jones' Marschellin leaves you wondering what kind of an idiot her husband must be to leave this lovely, elegant and impressive woman on her own, compelling her to seek satisfaction elsewhere. When Ms. Popp appeared on my screen for the first time in the opera, I thought she looked too old for the part. That was only for a second. Her singing and acting made Sophie, whom I normally dismiss as a ""doll soprano"" into a real girl on the edge of womanhood. Bless you, Ms. Popp, rest in peace. Ms. Fassbaender, as always, excels in trouser roles.

Yes, the trio singing the trio will leave you with tears in your eyes and happiness in your heart.

2291691,4,B0009I8PHI,"With this release, the second Kleiber-conducted Rosenkavalier they make available on dvd, DG has opted for making life hard for the collector. This is the original version of the rightly legendary Schenk production devised for, and staged at, Munich's National Theatre in the early seventies; the other dvd shows it as transferred to the Vienna State Opera some twenty years later, after the producer's death. The Munich version I was able to catch live in the summer of 1974, as I mentioned when commenting the DG dvd of the viennese adaptation, with most of these principals save for Jungwirth, who at my particular evening was (furtunately) replaced by Karl Ridderbusch; the viennese one I only know from DG's dvd.

This Munich version has of course much to commend: first of all, in this 1979 Munich evening Kleiber was a dozen years younger and it shows, his conducting mostly livelier and with more abandon than in the later viennese evening ... which in turn is enriched by more insights into the score and treatment of its sentimental facets. Second, Brigitte Fassbaender makes a far more credible young boy than the exquisite Anne Sofie von Otter, the latter's outstanding singing notwithtanding. Choosing between the two is practically impossible, and perhaps only when one comes to include into the equation what the french call ""le physique du role"" the scales slightly turn in favour of the german mezzo. If you want to make your impossible choice even more exasperating, try ""Wo war ich schoen einmal ..."" in the second act, the moment when Octavian, after delivering the silver rose, is smitten by Sophie's looks and is the work's turning point (as will be remembered by the orchestra, well into the third act, when it uses that same melody to introduce the glorious  trio of female voices). Both Fassbaender and von Otter make this a passage to remember for the ages, but to me the latter's voice shines perhaps like in no other Octavian, her facial expression of bewilderment and utter confusion a lesson for all Octavians to come.

I was never able to take a liking to Jungwirth's handling of the Ochs character. He became quite famous for his portrayal and is featured in the famous Solti-conducted set, studio-recorded by Decca almost 4 decades ago, but I always found his voice too light for the role, unsteady to an unbearable extent and he shows here a severe deficiency in his low notes (they're inaudible!), something frankly unforgivable and for which certainly you cannot fault Moll in the Viennese remake, who is in far better shape and stage-wise, a superior impersonator of the character.

And what of the two english Marschallins? To me, both quite below Fassbaender and von Otter in their respective sets, a notch above average in both cases, Jones perhaps preferable to Lott stage-wise but the latter in better shape, vocally. Dame Gwyneth plays the warmer Marschallin, Lott cooler and distant.

Sets and decors are a definite plus for the Munich staging, especially in the second act, as Faninal's mirrored, magnificent palais Schenk devised inexplicably turned for Vienna into an indifferent hall. The sound produced by both the Bavarian State Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic is outstanding, the latter's benefitting no doubt from progress in sound recording techniques.

So what will the tormented collector do when faced with choosing between the two sets? If your budget allows, buy both as a Rosenkavalier with Carlos Kleiber in the pit is a must; if not, frankly, toss a coin ...",1159056000,30,3525,4.996592844974447
2291692,5,B0009I8PHI,"This delightful performance of Strauss' magnificent opera is conducted by Carlos Kleiber, who obviously delights in the music.

Otto Schenk demonstrates the value that an excellent director brings to the staging of a grand opera.  It's a window back into 19th century Vienna.

The performers, too, are top caliber.  Gwyneth Jones has both the youthful playfulness needed in the first act, and the thoughtful reserve and majesty required of an empress, in the final act.

Our ""young couple"" are Brigitte Fassbaender and Lucia Popp, who join the Marschallin in gorgeous singing and equally excellent acting.

Manfred Jungwirth is as good (or bad and boorish) as Baron Ochs can be.  You'll justifiably anticipate that wonderful sustained bass note at the end of Act 2, where he sanctimoniously laments how drab the world must seem to everyone, whenever he's not around.

If you've never seen Rosenkavalier, this would be a fine first experience.  If you've seen several versions already, I think you'll agree that ""they got it right!""",1156032000,22,1031,5.162650602409639
2291693,5,B0009I8PHI,"Kleiber conducts a brisk performance which flows very nicely with the singing and action going on.  The only competition of this DVD is the other one also conducted by Kleiber.  The one under review here has Popp as Sophie, Jones as Marschallin, and Fassbaender as Octavian.  Jones is on her best behavior here and sings very well.  She looks the part and her mannerism is perfect for this role.  Fassbaender and Popp are the best Octavian and Sophie on DVD.  They interact with each other so naturally and you will truly believe that they are two young teenagers falling in love with each other.  Fassbaender's voice is very masculine and she sings very well.  Popp has always been my all time favorite and she is no doubt the best Sophie.  The trio from last act is simply music from heaven.  The set is good and is traditional.  It serves the opera well.  The other Kleiber DVD, however, is also excellent.  I don't think I want to have to choose here because I like both and I think anyone who is a fan of this opera needs to have both.

8061156,5,B0009I8PHI,"Ive had this DVD on the shelf for some time, and I finally got around to watching it. Good idea! It immediately joined my two favorite video Rosenkavaliers (the late-50s Salzburg film with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Sena Jurinac, Anneliese Rothenberger, and Otto Edelmann, under Karajan; and the 1994 Vienna production with Felicity Lott, Anne Sophie von Otter, Barbara Bonney, and Kurt Moll, also under Carlos Kleiber).
Rosenkavalier was perhaps Kleibers favorite opera, and both his recordings are wonderful in their dramatic pacing, emotional understanding, and mastery of orchestral detail. His younger self is a bit more impulsive, with faster tempos.
The big surprise in this production was Gwyneth Jones. She was a great singing actress, but sometimes her singing wasn't so good. Happily, this is not the case here. She does the best singing Ive heard from her, and she shows a complete mastery of the Marschallins complex character. Neither she nor Lott can equal Schwarzkopfs unique sophistication in her greatest role, but the both come close in their own ways.
Brigitte Fassbaender is not my favorite Octavian. She seems a bit too mannish, more like a modern teenager than an 18th-century one. This is especially true when she plays the disguised chambermaid and galumphs too much. But she sings beautifully. I prefer von Otters poise and grace; and as for Jurinac, she is so into the character that after a couple of minutes one completely forgets that shes a woman.
Sophie is usually rather uninteresting, despite the wonderful music she has to sing. But Lucia Popp finds all sorts of interesting detail and makes her a fully rounded character. When you add her silvery voice and physical beauty, she has to be the definitive Sophie.
Manfred Jungwirth is a fine Baron Ochs. He has a really beautiful voice and isn't afraid to use it, keeping the low-comedy shtick well in control.
All the smaller parts are well cast (the Annina is especially fetching) and the young Francisco Araiza does himself proud with the tenor aria. The sets and costumes are gorgeous.
Rosenkavalier is an opera that simply should not be messed with by directors. It lives and breathes Hofmannsthals idealized 18th-century Vienna, and nothing is gained (and much is lost) by updating it for greater relevance. All three DVDs mentioned above have exceptionally beautiful period sets and costumes. Enjoy them!",1520812800,,2390,5.130769230769231

8061161,5,B0009I8PHI,"Well...I wouldn't usually presume to write a review because while I love opera I haven't seen a live performance in many years.  I used to see the Met every year (Washington D.C. isn't so far and if I didn't care to go to New York they often came to the Kennedy Center).  I chance to be widely traveled and often saw La Scala as a young man, both in Milan and Verona.  And I have lots of CDs of course.  I can't remember anything about the first performance of Rosenkavalier I saw, even where it was...probably La Scala.  Except one thing...surprise and mild displeasure at Ottavian being a woman, which was obtrusively clear.

This Rosenkavalier is different.  Fassbaender is obviously a woman certainly, but she is a marvelous actor.  I am mostly gay, and cannot get much of the frisson Strauss intended from having two women on the stage, so having an Ottavian who is willing to forgo that and act like a boy is important to me.  In this performance I could suspend disbelief.  I thought Jones, Jungworth and Fassbaender were as good as you could possibly want.  I wasn't impressed with Popp but I am sure I will be when I watch the opera again, because I always am with that marvelous singer  (although before this it was always immediate, but then the sound on my television is not as good as it could be and for that matter my hearing is only intermittently as good as it was.).  The orchestra was perfect...the performance has a tension that has you hanging on every note.
I recommend this highly, but I am sure you can recognize that I have limitations as a reviewer.

I think it is reasonably apparent that I love opera, so perhaps you are wondering why I have not seen a live performance in many years.  It is because I got married.  In my late thirties I wanted to have children, courted an intelligent young woman, and together we saw many many operas.  When we were married, part of my scheme for our honeymoon was to see more.  After a trip to Hatteras for fishing, and before a climax at Istanbul, we went to the Met, a box of course.  The first opera was Macbetto...I know it's mediocre but I love it.  The witches appeared, my eyes were full of tears at their opening notes, and I heard snores.  My wife was fast asleep.  Not that it was a bad performance--it was wonderful.  But she had never had any interest in opera, and after sitting through forty or so she was married so why fake it?  But I was traumatized and didn't even see the other two I had paid for.  I'm divorced now, after thirty years, but spent the post divorce time in Florida and Turkey, where opera is not big.  Still, perhaps I will see you at the Met.",1454544000,2,2641,4.393814432989691
8061162,2,B0009I8PHI,"11-22-2015 Review for Der Rosenkavalier Opera with Gwyneth Jones, Fassbaender, Popp, Jungwirth, conductor Carlos Kleiber, director Otto Schenk, at Bavarian State Opera (Bayerischen Staatsoper).
Truly a beautiful production to view that is NOT enjoyable to hear.
Microphone placement was terrible.
Vocals are so often overshadowed by music with result that almost every scene quickly degrades into cacophony of noise.
Far too often singers individual notes and many complete words are totally unrecognizable as music nullifies the vocal performance.  This pain is relentless.
This particular performance is highly likely to have been superb to see and hear in person at the theater.  Truly unfortunate that microphone placement makes this DVD strain the eardrums and become a borderline headache by act 3.  Rarely is music relatively quiet; however in those moments, singers are clearly shown to be superb.
Note, some may think people with preference for orchestra may like this DVD. Wrong.  Somehow combined sounds overpower microphones resulting in both music and vocals being unenjoyable; especially tragic since singers and orchestra seem to excel in their actual performance.
