1046503,5,6305548498,"This is a hilarious video and Tom Green is a comic genius. The only thing more unbelievable than the things Tom does is that he does them with a straight face. I would recomend this video to any comedy fan. You'll laugh,  you'll cry, You'll pee your pants! P.S. I recevied the video 2 days after  placing my order. SWEEET!",948758400,,322,4.35

1046506,5,6305548498,"If you're into total shock comedy at it's best, I'd highly recommend Something Smells Funny.  Tom Green is like no one else with his unique ability to make people (at least some of us) laugh their a** off!  I can't  get enough of his material that's for sure and I would encourage anyone to  get this video...that is if you can handle it!",943574400,12,338,4.317460317460317

7891359,4,6305548498,"I am a huge tom green show fan, but I can't quite give this one a whole five stars.  It seems as though they (editors) picked randomly at skits to put on this tape.  Some are total GOLD, while others are flops.  Being a fan I still enjoy his skit flops.

Tom Green show fan?  You'll love it.  This is some of his crazier interviews, and yelling/flailing/public nuisance at its best.  New to Tom Green?

Maybe check out some videos from [...] before you buy, to see if you're into what he does.",1222732800,,493,4.225806451612903
7891360,5,6305548498,"Tom Green on VHS, whats not to love.
This was when Tom Green was very, very funny and everyone loved his show.

Good stuff!",1214611200,,123,4.125
7891361,5,6305548498,"If you are Tom Green fan, get this! It is the most hilarious thing i've ever seen. My favorite parts are when he dresses in a dress and wig and goes out on the streets, there are two segements like this, one where he cleans up garbage with a giant plastic bag, vomits and acts insane, the other he drags around a rope with parts of cows from butcher shop tied to it, falls into a fountain and seizures, scares people and acts insane. Tom Green is my favorite comedian! Tonsil Hockey is great too!",1168387200,,496,4.231578947368421
7891362,5,6305548498,"Tom green comedy isn't like normal comedy, its twisted and bizzare, tha why it is so great, because of its originality and uniqueness. if uve seen tom green on MTV then u probly won't like this, but y not give it ago anyway!",987897600,,224,4.232558139534884
7891363,5,6305548498,"I was having doubts at first when I went to buy this. But I'm really glad I bought it, 'cause this is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time. Sure, some of the bits are unfunny and pointless, but we are compensated with other really funny parts. My favorite is the ""None of your damn business"" part. Buy this video! You won't regret it!",980899200,,349,4.147058823529412
7891364,5,6305548498,"I have seen just about every Tom Green episode to ever air on MTV, but that was nothing like what I saw in ""Something smells Funny"".  I wasn't prepared for the amount of grotesque disgust, which I felt nearly the same time I couldn't stop laughing from Tom's Zany Raz's.  I have to say MTV is too censored, they don't have the COJONES to show this kind of stuff.  Have to say it wins RONALDO'S CHOICE for one to the top ten videos of all time.  All I need to know is what is Tom going to be up to next?",974246400,,502,3.9405940594059405
7891365,5,6305548498,"This is the best Tom Green video released out of his four videos. I have never laughed so much in my life,I had to change my pants serveral times  while watching it. Something Smells Funny is better than the Tom  Green:Uncensored,Tonsil Hockey,and Tom Gren:The Best of. Yes,there is some  material in this video that was aired on MTV but this is better because  they don't bleep ANYTHING.On the Slut Mobile you can see there  women's--well you figure it out. Better material than the MTV version. I have  never seen Tom Green use such language. Canadian TV is better than  American. GET THIS VIDEO.",967507200,7,598,4.747572815533981
7891366,5,6305548498,"This video will keep you laughing the entire time. If you like the show on MTV, you'll love this one. It's a bunch of great clips one after another.",963619200,2,148,4.137931034482759
7891367,5,6305548498,"I watched it so many times, and i still can't believe how hilarious it is!  He is sooo crazy but it's extremely funny! He's a genious, not only because it's so wild and odd, but that he does all of it with a straight  face!  Tom Green is the best yet, i hope there are more videos to follow.  If you're a fan and you still don't have this, you must have it or you're  missing out on one of the most hilarious things youll ever see!  These  Canadian skits are the best.",952646400,7,468,3.967741935483871
