7799287,2,1578482917,A poor excuse for a mystery thriller. The script and acing mediocre. There's not much more to say about this failed film!,1439683200,,121,4.545454545454546
7799288,4,1578482917,"I will be honest, I originally watched this film for Norman Reedus. However, I really enjoyed it. It's a nice little dark drama. It can be also considered as a psychological thriller. I liked all of the actors and the storyline. All in all I thought this was a really good film.",1413244800,,278,4.365384615384615

7799290,3,1578482917,"Hamlet hit's L. A. is the basis of this story & that pretty much explains it. It is always nice to see Jacqueline Bisset & she is here. Mary-Louise Parker appears even more so that Jacqueline. The story replaces Hamlet's time & culture with modern day L. A. Hello gun's, hello mob, hello bars, hello, hello, and hello. The script was not totally transparent & I did enjoy it some. I just wish it had varied more from a story that is so well known & of course, already better done. Lazy writing with OK acting & pretty women. 3.5 stars.",1264377600,,535,4.306930693069307
7799291,3,1578482917,"Although the title of Stacy Title's 1999 film noir reinvention of the great bard's Hamlet may be the best thing about the film, it at least makes for an interesting viewing. Title takes Shakespeare's classic and updates it to a sleazy, dark, hot and decadent modern LA (which when you think about it, is not much a stretch). It's a well made film with some very creative, if not haunting flashback and dream sequences. The cast and their performances, for the most part is top notch. In small roles, Jacqueline Bisset and Mary-Louise Parker shine. Parker, who plays the drug and dog food sampling Julia/Ophelia, is the most sympathetic character in the film among a company of sociopaths, drug dealers, criminals and complete losers.
There lies the problem with the film. The characters are for the most part so unlikable, that one could almost care less if Jack (played deliberately over the top by Jonathan Penner) ever avenges his father's suspicious death. In fact, several times during the viewing I was hoping Title would break with Shakespeare and bump off Jack. His ""love"" scenes with Parker are crude and unaffectionate, making him even more unlikable. Penner's portrayal can be fun at times, yet it's hard to be compassionate or relate to a guy like Jack (unless maybe you are filthy rich, obsessed and have a fetish for sex in restrooms). When sleazy characters are well written, as they are in Scorsese's films, the audience can get to know, like them, even root for them. Here, they are shallow, heartless, almost totally unattractive, stupid at times and rather uninteresting (no, I did not like them). The climax is overblown and ridiculous. Fortunately and thankfully, few are left alive at the film's conclusion.
Still, despite all the flaws. I can't help but recommend the film for film noir fans or those who are looking for ""something different"" as the filmmaking itself is interesting and well done. With a better script and well-developed characters, it could have been a very good film. However, for great writing, stick with old Bill's Hamlet",1062201600,3,2066,4.939655172413793
7799292,3,1578482917,"Stacy Title, the director of the little-known but effective black comedy The Last Supper (about liberal yuppies who bump off arrogant right-wingers) here presents a modern re-working of Hamlet with lots of gunplay, sleek scene transitions, quirky character traits (check out the pharmacist--very funny small bit), and a real flair for visual panache.
As Jack, the Hamlet guy, Jonathan Penner looks too old to be in grad school, but overall he does a much better job than the horribly miscast Ethan Hawke in Michael Almereyda's 2000 version of Hamlet (whose supporting cast brilliantly outshone the leads).  The always excellent Mary-Louise Parker is great as Julia (Ophelia) and in supporting roles, Maury Chaykin, Philip Baker Hall, Jonathan Banks, and Norman Reedus are all effective.  Jacqueline Bisset and Jamey Sheridan make a nice evil couple (Jack's mother and uncle, the co-murderers of his father), and Chris Sarandon puts in a silent appearance as the father-ghost in a number of very effective flashbacks and current sightings--by Jack, of course.
It's true that this is a bit thin compared to the real Hamlet--in fact, more than a bit--but the director has sacrificed meat and potatoes for some tasty sauce.  There's a lot of zing here and this is a very entertaining film, noticeably different in tone and temperament from any other Hamlet.  Here there's a real emphasis on noir elements that come to the surface in sudden flashes or bursts of action making this more a thriller than anything else.  Half-naked strippers, Mexican-American thug-cops, a crack-carrying gunman, and a crooked lawyer all contribute to the atmosphere.
Be advised that although the DVD case claims there is a trailer and behind the scenes footage, this is not true.  There are NO extras at all.  But it is a fun way to spend 90 minutes.",1032566400,3,1826,5.086956521739131
7799293,3,1578482917,"Hamlet set in the sleazy underworld of L.A.
I saw half of  this on cable and thought what the hell, So I bought it and was pleasantly surprised. The Acting is Top notch, Great Character actors Maury Chaukin,Phillip Baker Hall. and Mary Louise Parker all do a fine job. The Alas poor Yorik Scene works really Well.
So if you like contemporary updates of the Bards work.  Check this one out.
3 and 1/2 stars.",1004832000,6,406,4.4
