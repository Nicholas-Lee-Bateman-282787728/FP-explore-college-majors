8301252,4,B001F7XHX4,This is a nice classical martial arts movie. One that I am happy to add to my collection. Plenty of action and the acting wasn't too bad considering the era it came out of!,1395878400,,172,4.088235294117647
8301253,5,B001F7XHX4,"This was a fun movie.  I LOVED the primary character Ye.  He was really funny - grabbing people's swords all of the time and then complaining when they knew who he was.

The sets were very elaborate and very realistic - except for the snow.

The story line was quite complex and twisted.  However, the most interesting part was trying to figure out the dueling swordsman.  Which one is good, which one is bad -- its not that simple...

One of the funniest parts was when the Ye character was surrounded by a bunch of bad guys.  He says ""oh, that's the seven stars formation of the xxx school.""  Then, when he defeats them all, their swords remain lying in the 7 stars formation with him inside of the loop.  Someone asks what he is doing and he replies ""I can't move, I'm in the 7 stars formation.""  Then he walks away, having already defeated the bad guys.

Very funny.  Enjoyed the fight scenes, too.  However, I enjoyed the humor more.",1248912000,5,938,4.409356725146199
