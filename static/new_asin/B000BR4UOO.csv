8179084,5,B000BR4UOO,"If you are serious about Banjo, this is a must have.  This DVD is a five star solely based upon the performances.  The fact that it comes with TAB and Sonny discusses what he is doing along with the split screen is just icing.  Just watching the video gave me ideas and expanded my playing.  This is what banjo is supposed to sound like.  Caution, this an intermediate/advanced DVD, which means, unlike the Murphy Method (which are five star products in and of themselves), Sonny does not break the tunes down.  He will play them less fast and then at tempo.  You really need the TAB book.  I mentioned the Murphy Method,  previously, so I would like to say, it is because of the Murphy DVD's that I was able to understand and ""hear"" what Sonny was doing, but I still need the TAB.  Note that the DVD did not have the booklet on the disc.  Homespun gets five stars in that I emailed them that evening about that and the PDF booklet was in my in box the next morning.  So Homespun gets five stars too.

Bottom line, just as Wes Montgomery was the next step from Charlie Christian on Jazz guitar, so is Sonny is the logical progression forward (to me) from Earl.",1404086400,,1160,4.339534883720931
