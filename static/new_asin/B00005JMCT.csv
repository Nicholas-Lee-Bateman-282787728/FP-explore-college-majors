1495922,2,B00005JMCT,"Someone eats dog crap. Yes, that's where this film had to go after Stiffler drank piss in American Pie 2 and Jim had sex with a pie in the original.

The real shame in this one is that Stiffler is turned into a complete and utter child. In the others, he's almost believable as an immature high school kid, but in this one...he's intolerable.

The rest of the cast is as you'd imagine it, minus some of the major players (Oz is the most glaringly absent).

This is by far the worst entry into the series (not counting the direct to video entries, which I refuse to watch) - do yourself a favor, skip this one and go straight to American Reunion.",1374278400,,645,4.270491803278689
1495923,5,B00005JMCT,"I had this movie in my collection for 10 years and only saw part of it.  I recently watched it all and me and my bf laughed our butts off.  It's a classic toilet humour movie mainly for guys who are into cussing like a sailor on pay day and alot of gratuitous sex.  My fave scene is the dancing sequence at the gay bar, now that is entertainment.  I probably won't get into the other Pie movies, this one is enough. It's really the character Stifflers movie, Sean whatever his name is trips me out, I've grown to really like him, he's in another funny movie Evolution.  But this movie has alot of LOL parts that makes you laugh no matter what.",1371513600,,643,4.195121951219512

1495986,1,B00005JMCT,"This movie is written for people under 25 who want to be grossed out. Most other people will find it tasteless and depressing. It is undoubtedly funny in places, but anyone with intelligence will see a manipulative writer's hand all over it, trying desperately to come up with something to keep the franchise going. Mission achieved with ""American Reunion""! But at a price. This movie has a 4 and 5 star percentage of just 58%, very low for such a highly ranked box office movie. But it's not really a movie, just a bunch of tasteless scenes strung together so under 25's can talk about them and work out where to draw the line - that would be at Stifler and the grandmother.

In the DVD extras, writer Adam Herz confesses to a significant part of Stifler in his own character, so much so that he started acting a bit like Steve Stifler in his own life. It is a seriously disturbing revelation. This is the man who crossed the line with the grandmother. Where won't he go? And if it was just for the money, is that a good enough excuse?",1366156800,,1036,4.395833333333333

1495989,5,B00005JMCT,American Wedding is another great sequel in this trilogy.  I never cared to watch the others that were made except the first four.  Everybody came back for this one as well except for Chris Klein 'Oz' Ostreicher and  Mena Suvari as Heather.,1363910400,,240,4.666666666666667

1496144,2,B00005JMCT,"Riding a runaway train downhill, this mess of a third outing suffers from a seemingly rushed production and lazy setup that found half of the original cast missing (why bother?) and helplessly regurgitated jokes that didn't work that well the first time and certainly don't work that well the third.  The problem is that nothing feels fresh or new and everything is laced with this overwhelming feeling of desperation.  This is coming from someone who still enjoys the original `American Pie', despite it losing its effect upon subsequent viewings (it is one of those films that is never as funny the second time around, which is odd).  The cast is bored with this, even Seann William Scott (who I firmly believe should have been considered for a Supporting Actor nomination back in 1999) and the plot points just never exceed past the moderately low bar set by the second film (which was better than this but leagues below the original).  All the obvious wedding humor is used, and a slew of gags feel like lazy rip offs of jokes used in the first and second installments.

In this installment one of the boys gets married, so its up to the other boys in the group to give him a stag party and wedding reception he will never forget. Seann William Scott, who plays Stifler, steals the film like he did in the other ""American Pie"" films, and the scene in which the guys go to a gay bar is not to be missed, especially when Stifler proves he's as good a dancer as any gay guy out there. A really funny, poignant, and entertaining film, this movie is really the last of the great ""American Pie"" films, although other sequels would be released directly to DVD.

Yep... even Jim's friends.  Though the movie is about Jim and Michelle, it also lets Stifler and Finch shine a tad more. When Michelle's sister comes into town, the boys are immediately interested in her. Stifler though believes he has to be someone he's not to impress her, so he tries to act more polite and sophisticated. Finch on the other hand sees through his ruse and instead of acting like himself, becomes a lot more like the Stifler we have come to know (and love?).

Eh... when I saw this in the theater, I remember laughing a good amount. Now though, I really didn't think it was that funny. There were some scenes that were just horrible and not funny at all. For example, Stifler and Jim accidently smash a `congratulations' cake onto each others pants, which then has 2 dogs licking their crotch areas, Stifler laughing, Jim trying to pull them off... and then surprise, the parents of everyone sees it. I had to swallow sadness after seeing that. Though there are plenty of good scenes to make up for it like the chocolate truffle scene.  I don't know though, this one just didn't even come close to the first 2.

In the end, I would just give it a rent. Unless you are like me and like to be a completionist or like to laugh with American Pie even during its bad scenes. I own it!

The characters, for the most part, are rounded out beautifully (a few aren't given enough to do). Sean William Scott's ""Stifler"" will go down in movie history. Kudos also to Biggs, Hannigan, Thomas, and Levy, who add subtle shades to characters we've come to know.

The biggest scene,basically,is the bechelor party scene,where a gay guy Jim and his pals met in a gay bar brings a couple of foreign strippers to Jim's house and they party for a while,until it's busted up by the early return of Jim and Michelle's parents.

The bad thing is that none of the orininal girls are here except for Alyson Hannigan and even though the guys are back, Chris Kline is missing...oh wait, that's not so bad.  Anyways, this movie is really more about Stifler (William Scott) and Finch (Kaye Thomas) than really anyone else.  I mean, the film is about Jim (Biggs) and Michelle (Hannigan) getting married, Jim trying to impress her uptight parents (played brilliantly by Fred Willard and Deborah Rush) while trying to keep Stifler under control.  The real story though is Stifler's efforts to woo Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones) upon finding out she's still a virgin.  The problem is Finch is also trying to woo her as well.  Of course things go bad, people's feelings get hurt, the wedding gets jepordized as does Stifler's friendship with the gang.  The funny scenes mostly include crude humor and sex related antics, and of course there are beautiful strippers (Amanda Swisten & Nikki Schieler Ziering)...but the funniest part happens in a gay bar when Stifler has a dance off against Bear (Eric Allen Kramer) which is just drop dead hilarious!  It's almost as good if not better than the dance off in 'Starsky & Hutch'...and it's makes this movie stand out a bit from being just another random sex-comedy.  Yes, the American Pie series is over (well, 'Bandcamp' was released straight to video but I'm not sure too many people cared to see it...I mean, Eugene Levy was in it, but I don't even think he could have been enough of a draw) but it ended with a decent bang, not an explosion, but more than a pop.  Jim's dad is still hilarious and I'm sure there is bound to be a lot here to please the die-hard Pie fan, that's for sure.

1496426,3,B00005JMCT,"What to say about this film... well I did had suspicions that this would be a rehash and unfortunately my suspicions have been confirmed.

The original concept has already been and gone, perhaps the makers should have stopped at American Pie and not gone on to do a second film let alone a third!

The idea behind this film is a little different to the others at least, but as the film goes on, the typical gross-out moments, fatherly advice and pratical jokes creep in and it's back to the old formula! I suppose as the old saying goes... If ain't broke, don't fix it huh?

Also, what happened to OZ and the Sherminator? They were classic characters, seeing as it was a wedding shouldn't have all the characters from the previous two films been in it and got together (Nadia for example?) as a sort of a fair well / good luck tribute to Jim & Michelle? Or is it (as I suspect) that a fourth PIE film is in the pipeline? hmmm...

But there aren't all bad moments, the classic personality swap of Stifler and Finch made me laugh the most, just imagine the Finchmeister and Stifler being polite and proper, and of course... the stag party, that's not to be missed!!!

This film would be good as a rental DVD to watch with friends & family but unless you are a hardcore PIE fan, I wouldn't recommend buying it as the humour is something of an aqquired taste! The extras on the DVD are good and are of typical PIE fair, music videos, featurettes etc, the outakes are very good!",1151107200,,1473,4.380952380952381

Jim asks his band camp sweetheart, Michelle, to be his wife, and the hilarity ensues as the wedding plans unfold.  Planning a wedding is an enormous task to undertake, but add the cast of American Pie to it and it will be an extra raunchy, extra awkward good time.

There were a few things that were openly absent here which helped make the first two movies such successes.  Here the friend foursome does not include Oz, Kevin never mentions his former girlfriend, Tara Reid, again, and Shannon Elizabeth does not appear as the everyman fantasy.  To make up for this, see the stripper scene at Jim's house.

A lot of people were annoyed with this movie, and I think I see why although I thought it was a good idea.  Stiffler, the evil frat brat, has gone strait.  While he causes just as many problems, he is after a girl and wants to be seen as a nice guy.  When the time comes, he is able to put his best foot forward and actually saves the day at the end (the flowers).  Who would have thought?  But as his act is reveiled in the end, he gets his when he is tricked into having sex with grandma in the supply closet.  Ha ha ha ...

Oh, sure, Alyson Hannigan was in the movie.  However, for a movie that was supposedly about her wedding, she didn't have very much to do and her part, except for the hilarious proposal scene, wasn't written nearly as funny as it was before.

The fun starts when Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) asks his girl friend Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan) to marry him. As most of you remember, the two met up at band camp. Wise-ass Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) tries (and succeeds) to impress the heck out of Michelle's parents and younger sister. Most memorable scene is when Stifner and the gang show up in Chicago, unknowingly at a gay bar where he ends up having a 'dance off' with bar patron (Brad Hammer). Another one is where 'ol Stifner winds up eating a piece of dog poop while he avoids Michelle's mother finding out that the item he was holding was NOT a bar of chocolate. One more: when 'ol Stifner is tricked into 'personally servicing' Jim's 80 year-old grandma. Outrageously funny! Worth watching.",1122681600,3,861,4.824324324324325
1496518,4,B00005JMCT,"American Pie has had the akward teenagers getting laid for the very first time. Now, they are all grown up and they all have their own jobs and are going to other schools. Jim then announces that he is planning to marry Michelle and then the gang comes together for the very last time, with the exception of Stifler. Stifler doesn't know that he isn't invited and goes around having the thought that he is involved in the wedding. Jim cannot have the words to tell him that Stifler actually ends up saving the wedding in spots and becomes a unlikely hero and the book closes on the American Pie saga.

When I first heard that there was going to be a third American Pie, I had high expectations. My expectations were met with this hilarous film that closes out the film triliogy. But, I was suprised that the gang was cut in half and alot of the original cast didn't return for the third one. But, they managed to keep the best parts about the films. I thought that it was solid comedy at its best. It is dirtier, filthier, and full of cuss words. It's what made it very good.

Sean Willam Scott basically carried the whole film on his shoulders and made the most laughs in the film. His character basically stole every scene that he was in. He made me and everbody laugh uproariously. Stifler was given the whole movie to shine and he took that chance and made one of the most hilarous comedic performances in recent history. He can really carry a film but was never given a chance to, up until now.

In closing, American Pie has made us laugh with the famous Jim having intercourse with the pie and having sex for the first time. The third film closes out the series with a bang and makes us rememeber what it was all about all the way to the first film.

I had a wonderful time watching these films and I hope you had one magical time with the American Pie saga. I know I did.",1122681600,,1878,4.296610169491525

One of the things I love so much about this movie, is that there is never a dull moment. It hooked me from the opening music, to the nostalgic conclusion. It really showcases Seann William Scott's talent, and after viewing the first two movies, I just can't understand why they were so succesful without all that Stifler action.

Another plus (which many think of as a bad thing) is the fact that characters such as Vicky, Nadia, and Oz are gone. That really made the movie for me. I just didn't like those characters, and I thought they brought the first to Pie's down. They're just so boring, and ditzy, and, honestly, repulsive. I barely got through American Pie, and American Pie II.

1496521,3,B00005JMCT,"American Wedding is a hilarious movie, and offers a fun conclusion to the American Pie series. It ranks pretty close to the first one, and is much better than the second one, which was decent but felt really rehashed.

The cast has been slimmed down, dropping the characters that really didn't do much in number two. Newcomer January Jones fits in well as Alyson Hannigan's sister, and Eric Allen Kramer is hilarious as ""Bear."" The requisite gross-out gags from the first two movies have returned, as well as the obligatory nudity scene halfway in the flick, this time in the form of strippers at a bachelor party. However, American Wedding also manages some inspired non-gross jokes, such as a dance off where Seann William Scott gets to cut loose. There is also a nice role-reversal between Scott and Eddie Kaye Thomas that ends in some subtle character development for Stifler. Overall, these are the jokes that really carry the movie, and it might've been nice to see them rely less on gross-out humour this time around.

The dvd comes with some decent bonus features, including commentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, etc. If you can stand the gross humour the series is known for, American Wedding is worth viewing.",1116288000,,1219,4.884057971014493
1496522,5,B00005JMCT,"Keep in mind that the title of my review and my rating of the film is not saying that this film, the third and final in the ""American Pie"" trilogy"", has nothing wrong with it. There are quite a few flaws. For starters, where the heck's the cast?

Jim, Alyson, Stifler, Kevin, Jim's dad and Finch return to the fold, but wihtout Vicky, Stifler's brother (who admittedly had a very small part but was hysterical when shown), Jessica, Oz, Heather, the Sherminator and especially Nadia (although her and Vicky are both referenced to at one point), the film does feel a little half baked at times.

This one major qualm aside, ""American Pie"" otherwise measures up to the first two films in the series. I do agree with the many reviewers who said the film beloned to Sean William Scott. But unlike those reviewers, I look at this in a positive way, since his character Stifler provided us with such classic moments in the first two. I mean, who else could've done the pale ale scene so well in part one?

In this film, Jim (Biggs) is finally ready to pop the question to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). She accepts, and things soon go haywire, and provide more classic moments to this already classic trilogy, including Stifler's dance off at a gay bar, that special haircut, and the bachelor party from hell. And since it's the unrated version, the bachelor party is even hotter.

The extras are extremely intriguing. I haven't watched them all yet, but I'm sure they will be when I find the time.

In conclusion, despite the cast being absent, this a truly great finale for this classic trilogy of teen sex comedies. Please, buy it as soon as possible (that is, after you see the first two).",1113696000,,1683,4.596666666666667
1496523,3,B00005JMCT,"American Wedding is vulgar and is definitely not as good as the first two Pie movies, but it's not really as bad as these elementary schoolers below say it is. With every girl from American Pie and American Pie 2 gone except Michelle but every guy returning except Oz, nearly half the important and most interesting characters have disappeared: Vicky, Heather, Nadia, Sherman, Oz, Matt Stifler. Even Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas from Halloween Resurrection) is barely in 'Wedding'. There's an added young character, though, Cadence, Michelle's sister. I say young because this is the first movie where we see Michelle's parents, and they're not really one of the top 10 main characters. There's also Bear, who's hilarious.

Stifler (Seann Scott) is really the star of the show, even though Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan have the top billing almost every time I see a 'Wedding' poster or fansite. Stifler acts like a really annoying child in this flick - more so than Pie 2. All he really thinks about is sex and insults people for no reason.

I recommend renting the film, but not buying. The rated and unrated versions are both on the unrated edition. The unrated cut contains an introduction by the writer. DVD extras include 4 featurettes, outtakes, deleted scenes w/ intros, DVD-Rom and Cast/Filmmaker bios. Pay no attention to whatever you hear from children who are basically ten through twelve years old who shouldn't even be watching American Wedding in the first place. If you hear the same smack from a kid over thirteen, bashing the film, they behave like they're 11 anyways. As Stifler said, ""F*** those f**k*rs.""",1111449600,,1625,4.948717948717949

The same cheap humor is rehashed over and over again with little sign of originality. How often can you have Finch pursuing Stiffler's mother? Stiffler is oh so annoying as if all he ever thinks about is crude sex.  The scenes with the dogs humping Jim and Stiffler are repulsive.  You would think this group would have grown up but obviously they have not.

I know that I may sound prudish but I appreciate sexual innuendo when it is done with some tact and clever lines.  American Wedding does not come within seven miles of cleverness.  Pass on this and pick something else.  ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE!!!!!!!",1111104000,2,764,4.815384615384615
1496615,2,B00005JMCT,"I found American Wedding a bitter disappointment - and I say that as someone who loved the series' first two entries. I was amazed, when American Pie 2 was released, the film makers actually managed to capture lightning in a bottle twice. I guess three times was entirely too much to hope for. The major problem with American Wedding versus American Pie and American Pie 2: there's a LOT more Stifler in it. Chris Klein has not returned as Oz. This is bad. It completely scotches the special magic of the series as the unfolding story of four friends (and one jerk) who meet once a year, no matter what, as their lives progress. Because they're just that important to each other. I'm morally certain that many scenes and plot elements originally intended for Oz were given to Stifler instead. Unfortunately, Stifler himself is not that interesting. He's irritating and repellant, actually. Light comic relief as a supporting character, sure, lovely. Carrying the movie on his shoulders, no.

Again, as with American Pie 2, the relationship between Finch and Stifler's mother is relegated to a few brief moments at the end of the movie. Jennifer Coolidge who plays Stifler's mom has put on quite a bit of weight since the first film - it shows in her face and she's typically shot from the clavicle up - which severely limits what they can do with her. It's too bad really. The most complex, intense, potentially interesting and humorous relationship in the series is condemned to a few minutes worth of footage per film. And that little bit of Finch and Stifler's mother is the best thing in American Wedding, earning two stars all on its lonesome. The rest of the movie is a waste. My advice, if you love these characters: buy American Pie and American Pie 2 on DVD, save your money by passing on American Wedding, and hope against hope for another, better sequel.",1110240000,,1865,4.720858895705521

Stifler's character was always slightly on the retarded side, but I felt like they overdid his crude attitude in this movie.  That was unnecessary, and Jim seemed even more dumb than in the first two movies (take a certain shaving incident!).  Nevertheless, this movie has some very sweet parts aside from the crude humor.

The bonus material on the DVD isn't half bad either.  There's the making of featurette, deleted scenes, and outtakes.  Good to keep you occupied for a while. :)",1106092800,,622,4.766355140186916

Jims sexual disfunctions, Finches pretensions and obsessions with his MILF, Stifler and his profanity, Jims Dad and his eyebrows and Michelles flute box all make me laugh time and time again and so it was with great anticipation that I saw American Wedding the summer it came out.

It was funny and it was great seeing old friends but some of the heart was missing and the pie had grown stale just a tad. Something about focusing the entire movie and Stifler just threw the chemistry off. Jim was the viewpoint character in the first two flicks but Seann William Scotts popularity had eclipsed that of Jason Biggs and thusly he dominated the movie at the expense of the other characters.

Scott is fun to watch but you can't take an ensemble series and turn it into a one man show which is what they did so it didn't entirely work. When they worked the rest of the cast in the movie excelled. It was really the overemphasis on Stifler that really dragged the movie down and I consider myself a Stifler fan. But Stifler works better in small pieces of the pie not in huge chunks.

Its still a damn fun movies, especially the unrated version, but it ranks slightly below the first two pies for me.",1101081600,4,1297,4.4641350210970465

Even the reliable Stiffler character was getting old by now. To change him up a bit the directors tried to reverse the roles of Stiffler and Finch. It didn't work. Also by now you have to really wonder about Stiffler. Outdancing a gay man in a gay bar is not something he would want his next score to know.

And what was with the bachelor party scene? It made no sense. Why throw a bachelor party for three people and the groom isn't even around? Of course the strippers were hot, espescially the cop.

Ok gross out scenes here were Stiffler eating dog poop, a wedding cake covered in pubic hair, and the granny love closet. The best thing in this movie was Stiffler's 1979 black Trans Am. I wish I still had mine.

But by now the jokes were old, the characters (well the ones who showed up anyway) were just going through the motions, and Jimbo is still a quirky buffoon, but he can dance now.

1496619,5,B00005JMCT,"All 3 films of the American Pie series are hilarious and are 5 star worthy so I cannot tell which one is the best of the series or which one is the weakest of the series.  I have noticed that American wedding has recieved alot of bad reviews, I really do not know why.  This was a great ending to the series.  Many of the jokes were original and hilarious (There was a scene where Steve Stifler literally ate dog crap, sure it was gross but it was funny as hell) plus the bachelor party was hot!!!!  Plus I really love the fact that Steve Stifler had a major part in the movie when originally he was just a co-character in the first American Pie.  He had to be everybody's favorite charcter of the series because of the way he behave and all he ever thinks about is getting laid. In this film, he is more perverted then ever.  Anyway here is the plot.

After dating Michelle for years, Jim decides it is time to pop the question.  Even though his attempt to propose to her in the perfect way ends up going horribly wrong, Michelle says yes!  So now it is time to plan a wedding which means they have to do the usual things- Find a dress, decide where to get married, and meet the new relatives.  Jim and his friends (Stifler, Finch, and Kevin) try to do whatever the can to help without getting into trouble or end up getting into sexual situations.  Stifler is only being part of the wedding because Jim said he can plan his bachelor party.  Plus things start to become very interesting when Stifler and Finch both meet Michelle's very attractive sister Cadence and both try to compete for her affection.  Stifler starts to suck up to Candence's parents and behaves like Finch only on front of them and Candence.  That prompts Finch to start behaving like Stifler, he starts calling himself the ""Finchmeister"".  Ironically she like both of their acts.

In general, American Wedding was one flat out hilarious movie.  A Perfect way to end the series.  The only thing I hated was the absence of many of the characters like Nadia, Oz, Vicky, Heather , and Sherman.  There was one scene where Stifler mentioned Nadia but that was it.  It would have been nice to see them.  Other then that I really loved this movie and anybody who wants to laugh should see this film.",1093737600,,2264,4.4072289156626505
1496620,1,B00005JMCT,"Well, what can I say? When I first saw this at the video store I said to my wife, ""If I ever want to rent this movie, please shoot me in the head immediately."" Well the next week I was back at the video store and, you guessed it, I was renting this shocking movie. If only my wife had lived up to her promise, I would have not wasted my life watching this garbage. Yes, I would be dead, but happier.

The jokes are so desperate. They labor hard and long but absolutely no humour is achieved, its amazing! The jokes fall flat and are obscene: not obscene in their content (this movie is about as challenging as a haircut), but obscene in the contempt that the director, writers and actors have for us the audience by believing we would actually find this funny.

Speaking of the actors, it was interesting to see how bored and underused Thomas Ian Nicholas and Alyson Hannigan were. In shockingly unfunny scenes such as the bucks night Nicholas, like throughout the entire movie, looked like he didn't know whether he was a character or a piece of furniture.

And now to Stiffler. Well let me say this: Bill Murray playing a deranged greens keeper, finding a Babe Ruth Chocolate Bar at the bottom of a swimming pool (a swimming pool that has been sterilized because said chocolate bar has been mistaken for a human turd), picking up the chocolate bar, inspecting it and then proceeding to eat it while the snobby wife of a snobby judge faints believing him to be eating excrement is hilarious.(Caddyshack). An idiot eating a dog turd isn't. (American Wedding).

Please avoid this movie, or watch it in the same way you would view ""Triumph of the Will"", not for entertainment, but as an education to see how far into madness the human race can go. However, while the tennents of National Socialism are idiotic, de-humanizing and genocidal, this movie is just pure evil.

1496621,2,B00005JMCT,"What American Wedding lacks in heart and humor, it makes up for in embarrassing gross-out scenes.  Apparently not realizing that the key to the success of the first two movies is the spiritual journey that the friends undertake as their lives change, the writers of American Wedding throw one gross out comedic scene after another.  The jokes wear very thin by the end.

The story is very simple.  Jim and Michelle have been dating for a few years and now want to get married.  The rest of the movie is a series of goof ups, gross outs, and scene after scene of Steve Stifler doing stupid things.  With so much focus on the antics of Stifler, the wedding plot is almost completely drowned out.

The worst part of the movie is not the juvenile humor, though.  The problem is that the jokes are telegraphed so that the audience already knows exactly what the punchline will be before the joke is actually executed.  It's one thing to cleverly set up a joke, but this movie shouts from the rooftops, ""Hey, we're telling a joke here!  Haha!  Stifler doesn't realize it's actually Jim's grandmother in the closet! Haha!  Get it??""

This movie could have been written and executed much better.  Instead of trying to build heart around the humor, the writers could have (as they did in the first two movies) built the humor around the heart.

The cast did the best they could, especially Eugene Levy reprising his role as the ever-caring dad.  However, the script is not salvageable and the movie falls flat despite the best efforts of all the actors involved.

This movie is not one you will want to own.  It really isn't even worth renting.  1.5 stars rounded up to 2 stars for this one.",1093132800,,1682,4.583892617449664

This film has all of the usual actors in their roles with Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan on their way to the altar. So while the women plan a wedding the ""men"" run around town still in search of sexual pleasure in all of its most inane of forms. Stifler (Sean William Scott) is full of his typical gross antics, this time with dogs, dog waste and a focus upon the only thing he seems capable of understanding.....sex. While most of the silliness and surprise of the original ""Pie"" film worked that same vulgar effort misses sorely in this film, basically just grossing people out with the worst of gags and a really stupid and entirely gratuitous T&A scene that could have easily been thrown on the editing floor.

The filmmakers were smart enough to stay with Eugene Levy, Molly Cheek, Fred Willard and Deborah Rush as the parents who birthed all of these nincompoops!

 Alyson Hannigan is totally WASTED in this film - hardly even used, actually, much to its detriment - although even her considerable talents couldn't save this travesty. No, instead we're left with Jason Biggs and that gaggle of three-name actors who are the most witless, insipid and unpleasant screen performers in a long time. Talk about flop-sweat!! Watching these guys flail away in an effort to enliven the sagging, unfunny and juvenile script is akin to witnessing a really bad car wreck - you know you should avert your eyes, but you're stupefied with morbid interest. The writers obviously followed the hacker's trusty adage: ""when in doubt - or simply out of ideas, use the ""F"" word, and profusely."" Foul language flies like cake sprinkles in this sorry concoction - why anyone would debase themselves by participating in this project is beyond me. And the DVD extras? Who cares?

The only flaw of the movie is some characters are missing. Oz, Heather, Vanessa and that other chick that had no interest with Finch. The Sherminator was left out too. What's the deal with that?
But it still was a good flick. Stifler still made us laugh like never before. He goes in to ruin Jim's party. He was almost convicted of raping a dog while Stifler fell down because one of the dogs knocked him down and licked off the cake frosting to you know where.
Makes you wonder if Stifler is gay. Well, he didn't hesitate to kiss with Ashton in ""Dude where's my car?"". And poor Stifler lost the wedding ring while the little dog ate it and ""dumped"" it in the grass. Boy was that funny trying to play it off like it was chocolate and you should've seen Finche's reaction.
Once again, it hasn't lost its touch where Finch scores with Stifler's mom at the end. But poor Stifler ends up scoring with the band chick's grandma-Uuuggghhh! Gross!

Stifler has more depth in this movie thn he had in the other 2. He is funnier and is more of a jerk than before. Also Jim is funnier and just a lil more perverted which is kind of hard to believe but it's true. Michelle is still the same nympho in the movie but has some funny scenes. Finch just made me laugh out loud of some of the things he gets into in this movie. Kevin has not that many scenes but he is still funny in this movie. Jim's dad is still the same funny guy like always but he is more funny than before, thank you Eugene Levy who plays that part you did a great job. And the movie soars with the addition of Michelle's parents ( Actors Fred Willard and Deborah Rush). The funniest scene has to be the right after the bachelor party when Jim and Michelle's parents are cluless of what just happened at Jim's house.

What is also great about this dvd is that it has the rated version and the unrated version. So those who didn't see the movie in the theater can see the theatrical release( rated version) and the one with new scenes and extended parts of scenes(unrated version). The commentary is funny too. Sean William Scott and Jesse Dylan commentate and on the other feature commentary is Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas all comentating on the movie( in my opinion the one with the 4 actors is funnier thant the one with Sean and Jesse but my opinion about that doesnt really count cause its up to you the one who buys this movie) All of the acotrs in this movie do great jobs and this is a deffinete must buy for ur DVD collection.

1496716,3,B00005JMCT,"I am a HUGE fan of the first 2 pie films. My high school life was nowhere near as fun and exciting as this so I was intrigued from the start. The films had interesting and fun characters and it was easy to want to see more.
I missed the 3rd film ""American Wedding"" when it was in the theatre. I wasn't pleased that a majority of the cast was absent from this outing, so I just didn't bother.
I just picked up the DVD, and watched it last night. I was to say it was better than I thought it would be, but still just average.
What's sad is the premise had so much promise and with all that was built up about the bachelor party scene, I thought I was in for a rare treat.
Jason Biggs & Alyson Hannigan are still both excellent in their roles. There was a level of sweetness that really isn't seen in the first 2. Eugene Levy has an expanded role in this 3rd film. He is so welcomed. I have enjoyed his character and never think he's ""too much"". It's nice to see this guy get some comedic respect after all these years.
The biggest problem I have is with the ""Stifler"" character. In the beginning of this movie... his foul-mouthed antics are so over the top that it's annoying. It appears as if he didn't want to do the movie so decided to do a parody of Stifler. His character is just as unwanted onscreen as it is by the viewing audience.
The other BIG letdown is the ""Bachelor Party scene"". Don't get me wrong; I like naked women just as much as the next guy, but this was lame; especially when much of the hype was about this scene. Sure the girls are smoking hot (most notably Nikki Schieler as the cop). But the scene falls desperately flat soon after. To the point where the gags are no longer funny but just sad. What should have happened is the Bachelor Party should have been the focus of the film, much like the first 2 where a major party was the focus. That would have been a nice way to draw in the other cast members to come back.
After seeing the movie, it's easy to see why most of the cast did not comeback. The only question I have is, while Shannon Elizabeth will no longer do nudity and Mena Suvari is married to a very successful cinematographer, what is Chris Klein so busy doing that he can't come back as Oz? He's gone nowhere since the first 2 films.
There are some great ""toilet humor"" gags in the film. I am a big fan of toilet humor and just watching Jim land into awkward situations is funny. Also seeing someone eat poop, while gross, is still pretty funny.
All in all this was just an average film, a decent ending to an otherwise great franchise. I think it could have been much better if the creators paid more to substance than to cashing in on the name.
If you are looking for a really funny college movie, I say get your hands on Van Wilder, that's a film that won't let you down.

The only worthwhile part of the movie -- if a part can be called worthwhile; nothing could have saved this disaster -- would be the acting of Seann William Scott. His ability to critique each moment with one of his memorable quips was somewhat interesting. Even with him, I still give the movie only 2 stars.
If you must see the movie in order to finish out the series, get it from the rental store or a friend, but do not buy it. You will regret it.",1086652800,,679,4.151515151515151
1496718,3,B00005JMCT,"The interesting thing I noticed about the reviews for this movie is that every review literally has a completely different opinion of it, regardless of how they rated it. Basically, I liked the original American Pie, and I thought American Pie 2 was even better. THIS movie was okay, but I think only people that are really, REALLY into the first two movies can appreciate it.
Jim has been dating Michelle for years, and he finally asks her for her hand in marriage, which she accepts. Eventually, Stifler decides to throw Jim a bachelor party, along with Jim's usual friends Kevin, Finch, and Oz -- wait, Oz isn't there. He wasn't even mentioned in the whole movie! What's up with that?
I read somewhere that someone said this movie should have been called The Steve Stifler Show. I totally see where that reviewer is coming from (especially since Seann William Scott got higher billing than Alyson Hannigan). Yeah, Stifler WAS the funniest character in the first two movies, but in comparing those movies to THIS one, it seems like the antics and situations he was in have gone from funny and dumb to just dumb -- well, during the first half of the movie, anyway. And you have to admit that the scene in the gay bar wasn't 100% necessary.
To me, the only character that was completely funny throughout the whole movie was Jim's dad (I have yet to see Eugene Levy on screen when he isn't extremely funny). The DVD extras weren't all that, either (but are they ever?) The ""Enter the Dominatrix"" thing was really kind of pointless, and  the ""Stifler Speak"" segment (starring...who else?) really makes you start to wonder just whose movie this is. All in all, though, while not a total waste of time, I'm glad I only rented this movie. But if you already own the other two movies, you might as well add this one to your collection. American Wedding really helped make 2002 the year of Sequels That Nobody Went to See along with Legally Blonde 2 and Analyze That.

P.S. One thing that's been bothering me for a while...people complain about how vulgar and distasteful these American Pie movies are, yet nobody had a problem with Porky's?",1085270400,3,2148,4.667546174142481
1496719,3,B00005JMCT,"There's one thing you have to say for ""American Wedding"": like the two ""American Pie"" films that came before it, it is unapologetically unashamed of its shamelessness.  Here's a film that doesn't try to hide its gleeful perverseness under a bushel of coy double entendres; instead the film revels in its frank and openhearted treatment of sexuality and lust.  ""American Wedding"" is clearly a comedy about sex and it doesn't pretend to be anything but.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad will, I suppose, depend on your own affinity and tolerance for jokes and images that routinely push the boundaries of common decency and good taste.  In fact, the film wears its tastelessness almost as a badge of honor.  And just in case you're unfamiliar with this series and its brand of humor, subtlety and wit are not considered virtues in an ""American Pie"" world.
In ""American Wedding,"" Jim and Michelle - he a self-described pervert and she a self-described nympho - have finally agreed to tie the knot.  The film centers around Jim's attempts to convince Michelle's square, uptight, sexually repressed parents that he is indeed husband material for their less-than-innocent daughter.  The problem is that his efforts are consistently being undermined by the inane, out-of-control antics of Steve Stifler, the foulest-mouthed, dirtiest-minded professional adolescent this side of Bluto Blutarsky.  Seann William Scott, in fact, steals the show as Stifler, providing an over-the-top manic energy that is both endearing and infectious.
Indeed, without Stifler, there would be precious little to recommend this particular ""American"" outing.  The jokes and setups, for the most part, are crude and graphic without being very imaginative, and writer Adam Herz and director Jesse Dylan, even when they hit on an inspired piece of silliness (as when Stiffler winds up dancing mano a mano with a guy in a gay bar), end up diluting the humor by letting the scenes drag on well past the point where they're truly funny anymore.  This is not to say that there aren't a few good laughs in ""American Wedding,"" just that they don't come often enough to really lift the film much above the ordinary.  Luckily, the funny moments increase a bit in the final stretches of the movie.  In the film's defense, I would also add that, like its two predecessors and unlike many sexually charged teen comedies, ""American Wedding"" conveys a certain affection for its characters.  In addition to Stifler, Jason Biggs as Jim and Eugene Levy as Jim's befuddled but strangely tolerant and supportive father come across as decent, well-meaning and likable individuals.
The film itself may be uneven, but as a character actor who makes an indelible impression on the material at hand, Scott is the genuine article.  He transforms what is essentially cinematic rotgut into sweet-tasting vintage wine.  All hail the Stifman!",1084060800,,2887,5.086864406779661

1496781,3,B00005JMCT,"American Wedding, like its two predecessors, is, to some extent, reviewproof.  After all, teen sex comedies are rarely ambitious enough to try and earn critical praise.  Nonetheless, while it would be silly to judge American Wedding as a piece of art, it is fair to assess it on its own merits within its genre, and on that level, it is a decent, though not great, movie.
The first movie in the trilogy - American Pie - was rightly regarded as a very good movie.  While it had some of the standard teen movie humor, it also was something better, primarily because of the characters who were both likable and not the standard cliches.  By the third movie, however, most of the characters who were so endearing before are either gone or relegated to minor roles.  Instead, the less serious characters - ones such as Finch and Stiffler and even the two principals in Wedding - Jim and Michelle - are the ones in the spotlight now.  The result is a movie that still has some good points, but is also a pale imitation of the original.
The principal good things about the movie is the generally likable characters and the avoidance of some of the usual wedding-movie cliches.  In particular, I find it refreshing to have a movie without the standard romantic crises arising from dumb misunderstandings; at least in this movie, Jim and Michelle never really waver from their commitment to marriage; the complications come from other events.  On the other hand, the humor is often sporadic and even the events designed to get the biggest laughs - such as one involving two dogs and a cake - are hit-and-miss.
For fans of the other movies in this series, this movie may be worth watching, but because it is dependent on those earlier movies, I cannot recommend it to anyone unfamiliar with the earlier films.  For the fans, however, this is a three-plus star effort, a bit above average but nothing really great.",1080172800,,1903,4.673652694610778
1496782,2,B00005JMCT,"O.K first of all, the American Pie Trilogy was no way in line for being the greatest trilogy of all time. But that doesn't disregard the fact that for what the films were, they were good.
They were funny in an uncomfortable way, but then again I'm sure that by now you know that.
This one however was not. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the film but it wasn't very good. The characters that originally made the films watchable in the first place became old hat and stretched. They weren't the same characters anymore.
Also the cinematography was extremely wierd for a comedy.
In the first two the look of the films was easy going and light. This one was dressed up witha lot of colour and styalised shots. None of which is needed in a comedy film.
Anyway, If your one of those people who lives for teen comedy such as this trilogy, Road trip and frankly anything starring Sean William Scott, then unfortunately you generally know nothing about film. Don't worry about it though, much of us fanatics would love to take your place so that we could like more films and criticise less. So if you are one of those people, then you will like this film alot.
However if your not, and you're more than happy to sit down and watch through a huge back catalogue of old films rather than the drivel that Hollywood is constantly spewing up, then you will be dissapointed with this film and it's lack of attention to detail.

1496783,3,B00005JMCT,"One of the things the producers behind 'American Pie 2' were proud of was that most of the cast (and all of the major players) of the first movie returned. Unfortunately, this was not the case here. Oz (Chris Klein), which was an integral part of the group in the first two movies, isn't even mentioned in 'American Wedding'. An actor's absemce (whether it's due to his unwillingness to rejoin the franchise or any other reason) is understandable. And since Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) had so little to do, Oz's absence was a blessing in a way. But a mention of him and his whereabouts would have made much more sense than completely erasing him from the American Pie 'mythology', hoping we (the viewers) won't notice.
While Finch & Kevin fade into the background, Stifler (Seann William Scott) gets a much bigger part than ever before. He's still an obnoxious girl chaser, who didn't seem to outgrow his highschool juvenile - jock personna, up until the end of the movie.
Besides the big change in the group dynamics, this movie (unlike 'Pie 2') takes a big turn story wise. Jim, Michelle, and their wedding are now the center of the movie, instead of the group's friendship & dynamics. We don't get to see the 'stories' of Kevin or Finch, for instance, develop any further, or hear a word about their current relationships (besides the inevitable encounter with Stifler's Mom).
The laughs, though, are still there. They still are, or course, immature and pretty coarse, but by now, this is wat is expected of the 'American Pie' series.",1079568000,,1566,4.761029411764706

It had a very good storyline (especially at the bucks night) and hilarious twists and turns which are guaranteed to make you crack up laughing. The intellegence of the characters(stifler) is also funny.  This movie shows all the pros and cons of a wedding and how to impress the in laws.

When Jim wanted to be with Nadia, he came to Michelle and helped him out.  Michelle fell in love with Jim in the beginning, she made the right choice not to say anything having feeling for him and let Jim find out who wanted to be with. Jim was with Nadia, he always think about Michelle and he said good-bye to Nadia and went to Michelle.

1496786,1,B00005JMCT,"Expectantly, this will be the last attempted installment of The Pie.
Hopelessly crass and pervasively stupid humor is the only thing keeping this movie from being thrown into the incinerator. Anticipating some form of entertainment in this slapstick retardation, it was about as amusing as watching mushrooms grow; difficult to keep from nodding off in this one. Wait, I think I did! At moments when things are clearly dull, nudity; a certain death toll for ANY film who utilizes it like a life-preserver vest. On top of it all - seriously poor film editing. Story lines and scenes jump around as spastically as a gerbil on speed, leaving you to the subliminal pondering of ""huh?"" I dare say a high-school editing crew could have done a better job. Noticeable departures from the original cast include: Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, Tara Reid, & Mena Suvari who are noticeably missed at times, but oddly never mentioned.
Once again, however, Eugene Levy does a commendable job keeping this one afloat with his father-be-wise humorous methodology to the underage diatribe that is relentless at best. I loved the original, tolerated the second pretty well, but this thing is an utter failure. It is certainly the kind of film that will undoubtedly mar any actor's filmography; leading one to strike it off their list of ""movies they've been in.""",1078358400,,1345,5.008928571428571
1496787,2,B00005JMCT,"For fans wanting to see the next step in the lives of this group, your view will be slightly skewed.  Although the other characters are there, they seem to be more of a background and motivation for the character of Stifler.  Kevin, played by Thomas Ian Nicholas, says very little throughout the entire movie.  Jason Biggs, playing the future groom, does not have the big role you'd think he'd get.  Alyson Hannigan also has a small role.  Chris Klein absent from the movie altogether and is not even mentioned.
Since he stole the show, my guess is that the filmmakers decided to give his Seann William Scott, ""Stifler,"" more screen time.  As a result, he doesn't fit with the movie.  Although important to the plot, the gags seem to be formulaic.  If his ingesting something disgusting was funny before, it should be funny now.  This time, however, it is a bit less believable.
Eugene Levy is always a treat, but even he couldn't save this one.  I felt this would provide closure, but the movie was a bit disappointing.  I would not recommend this unless you are renting it.",1078185600,,1075,4.634920634920635
1496866,4,B00005JMCT,"(...) In my opinion, American Wedding is absolutely hilarious (in parts) and the storyline moves along pretty quickly ..... contrary to what other reviewers might have said, I think that the parts with Stifler in them where so funny!
This should have been the movie to follow American Pie - I was a little disappointed in the storyline to American Pie II, whilst Tara Reid is a great actress I thought the storyline around her was somewhat flat and not at all funny .... which meant that American Pie II had some real downer moments ...... this is definitely not the case with American Pie the Wedding!
This movie has it all .... Jim, Jim's dad (he is really good in this one), Stifler, Finch and Stfler's mum, and a really, really funny bachelor party (and for you guys out there, lots and lots of breasts! or ""boobs""), and even has a ""granny"" scene (not to be missed - I won't say anymore other than a granny and Stifler - what do you think happened?).
This movie made me laugh out loud ..... and I think that's what a good comedy can do!  So, I say, rent it, borrow it, buy it - hey just watch it ...... I don't think you'll be disappointed! I give this one an A+.

I have a feeling that there will be more to come. The trilogy was so popular that fans will insist on more. This movie was so funny, although goes 2 da x-treme at times. If you know what I mean. The chocolate truffle scene for instance. Very funny thanks to Seann William Scott, but very gross at the same time. The bachelor party was one of my favorite parts of the movie. Those two blondes were funny and sexy. I also liked the gay club scene, when Bear was introduced and he and Stifler had the dance-off. The film is loaded with laugh out loud humor, the DVD has plenty of extras. I recommend the whole series. It's like a really good on-going movie sitcom with nudity and language.",1078099200,2,829,4.3896103896103895
1496868,1,B00005JMCT,"If there were any concept of talent or justice in Hollywood, Jesse Dylan would not be allowed to direct another film as long as he lived. I watched this film with my expectations set about as low as I could possibly set them. And amazingly the film was even worse.
For those who don't know, the American Pie movies, of which this is the third, are a series of comedies that want to have their American Pie and eat it, by opting for both trying to gross us out and then claiming a kind of cloying moral message at the end,. These kids are desperate for sex, but of course at the end of it, they always do see that there's more to life than sex.
And, naturally, because the films have to cop out anyway to satisfy what they see as a hormonally challenged teen target audience, they get the sex as well.
The first of the films did surprise a little by the eventual maturity of its message, even though - as I said - it still compromised so thoroughly that the message rang kind of hollow. It wasn't much of a movie, but there was at least the claim of a sweet conventional morality to it. The second one was pretty much more of the same.
Still, average to weak as they were, they were Citizen Kane compared to American Pie 3, which is made with the lowest level of technical proficiency I've seen on the big screen in a long while.
In this chapter, which we've been told  - thank the powers above for small blessings - will be the final one, Jim (Jason Biggs) and his longtime girlfriend Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) have decided to get married. Of course hilarity ensues even during the proposal which Jim fudges so completely that Michelle thinks he's requesting an embarrassing sexual favour in public. Jim's buddies Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are willing to help on hand to help with the arrangments, but despite their best efforts they can't keep the obnoxious Steve ""Stifmeister"" Stifler (Seann William Scott) out of the picture. He's the one who - even more than the rest - has only one thing on his mind,
Both Finch and Stiffler find themselves in even more conflict when Michelle's younger sister, Cadence (January Jones), turns up, and they are both interested in her.
So, the scene is set. The movie has a lot to play with. After all, so many things can go wrong in the run up to a wedding, and there's always that old fall back of the disastrous bachelor party and losing the ring. Written by Adam Herz - you should know who to blame - American Pie 3 does every predictable thing you can think of but does most of them so badly that you hardly notice.
Director Jesse Dylan appears unable to direct, his cinematographer Lloyd Ahern II, appears unable to light, and editor Stuart Pappe appears to have two hands full of thumbs. And no sense of rhythm. If you doubt my comments on the cinematography and you are unfortunate enough to see this film, look particularly at the lighting in the car scenes, where a huge light seems to be hidden just under the dashboard. If you want to check out why I say the editing is so bad, just watch a dance scene in a gay bar where Stiffler struts his stuff to outdance a gay dancer. It's about as badly filmed and edited as you can possibly imagine such a sequence being.
I am a great fan of Allyson Hannigan, who I liked a lot as Willow in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series, but she's wasted here, and you spend a lot of time feeling sorry for her - in the relatively brief sequences she's on screen.  Seann William Scott has been much better than this, even in the awful Bulletproof Monk. And in Evolution. Here he mugs so excruciatingly at times you wonder whether the director is really this bad or whether Scott's doing it to get back at him for something. Eugene Levy as Jim's dad has a couple of good scenes, but it's all repetition from the earlier films.
And of course there's the gross out stuff. The pie of the first movie becomes an engagement cake, a dog licks someone's crotch, dog excrement gets mistaken for chocolate truffle, pubic hair ends up all over a wedding cake, and of course there are numerous scenes where dubious sexual activity, or actions mistaken for dubious sexual activity take place. It's all like an update of the old - and even then tiresome - Brian Rix farces that used to grace the English stage.",1077926400,,4311,4.428211586901763
1496869,3,B00005JMCT,"This series was a goldmine for Universal.  No one expected a raunchy story about high school kids trying to get laid to spawn and a franchise and make $350 million in US box office.  The first film is a classic high school movie.  The sequel was good, and funny, but hampered by too many characters and too many storylines.  This one goes back more towards the original, with a few main characters and the rest just fading into the background.  Some addition by subtraction in this movie are the removal of the following characters, Oz, Nadia, and Oz's and Kevin's girlfriends.  See, some of those characters were so useless that I cannot even remember their names.  As usual you get the shot of Jim's dad catching Jim in an embarrassing situation and you have something gross happen to Stiffler.  One of the major flaws is the early incarnation of Stiffler.  At the beginning he is a loudmouth who comes off more as nerd, than jerk.  It takes a few scenes for Stiffler to resort back to being a jerk, the Stiffler that we know and love.  In the end this film draws on the sweetness that made the first two more than gross our comedies.  This is a funny film that, the second time around loses its luster, so this is not really built for repeat viewings.
About the DVD:  Included on the DVD are deleted scenes.  There is a rather useless documentary on Stiffler speak and a ""Cheesy Wedding Video"" which is just that, cheesy.  One thing to take from this film is that Stiffler, is best suited as a background character, not as a main character.

1496872,1,B00005JMCT,"When compared to a train wreck I suppose this movie, ""American Wedding,"" the third in the American Pie trilogy, engages in a photo finish.  How to say that more succinctly and clear?  ""American Wedding"" is a cinematic disaster that should be avoided at all cost.  I suppose there may be a use for a movie like this.  After all the CIA still has Saddam Hussein and are surely interested in him telling all sorts of things.  Hussein could be forced into watching ""American Wedding,"" continuously looped until driven absolutely mad from being subjected to un-funny sight gags and tired forced American Pie I and II references until kicking and screaming he spills the Garbanzo beans.  Just the threat of having to watch the character Stifler in an annoyingly abrasive performance would be enough.
Half of the cast bailed from American Pie I and II and for good reason.  Chris Klien (Oz) and Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia) are most notably absent and surely happy about their career choices to sit this one out.  While the majority of the movie industry have moved past the ""let's see just how gross we can make the sight gags,"" the American Pie team has not.  So, we are left with jokes about consumed dog poop and body hair from certain regions of the body making it's way into the air conditioner and all over the wedding food.  Not much in American Wedding is funny.  Not much in American Wedding is worth watching.
So surely there must be something redeemable here.  Well die-hard fans of American Pie I and II may get a few yucks here and there and appreciate seeing Alyson Hannigan's ""Michelle"" character blossom beyond band camp.  And actually the soundtrack is quite good, but I can't recall the last time I or anyone else went to see a movie to listen to the soundtrack.  Save your money with American Wedding and skip the movie, go buy the soundtrack instead.

1496873,3,B00005JMCT,"""American Wedding"" was not as good as many people said it was. It was basically just the same old story. It was also ridden with gross humor, profanity, and crude humor. I'm not saying that those are bad thing, but it just didn't work in this film. It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't a good one. I have mixed thoughts on this one. ""American Wedding"" is part three in the American Pie movie seris, but it was weak. It didn't have the entire same cast, and most of the laughs come from Eugene Levy, who is the hilarious guy from ""Bringing Down the House."" He reprises his role from the previous films, and he is most of the comedy in the movie.
When the film starts, we see main character Jim, and his girlfriend Michelle. They have known each other for several years, and Jim proposes fresh out of collage, and she says ""yes."" Jim's parents are thrilled that their son is finally getting married. Jim's first problem is that he has to decide from his two best friends, Finch and Kevin, which one is going to be his best man. They both know that it is not going to be Stifler, a person who went to high school with them, and who is not liked by everyone else. Jim and Michelle don't even invite him to the wedding, for fear that his continuious profanity, and rude ways would ruin the event. But Stifler somehow gets Jim's parents to invite him to the wedding, and finally Jim allows him to plan the bachlor party. Michelle's parents Harold and Mary arive, as does her sister Candence, who both Finch and Stifer both set their eyes on. All in all, everybody is excited about the event, except Jim's grandmother who objects to the wedding because of Michelle not being Jewish, but the main thing on Jim and Michelle's mind is that they could get married without a hitch.
A main problem with ""American Wedding"" is that Stifler was unjustifly mean. It seemed that the only reason for him being in the movie is for him to ruin the wedding. There were a few funny parts in the movie-for example the scenes where Jim tries to learn how to dance for his wedding, or some of the things Stifler does throughout the film. Take this one scene where Stifler lost the best man ring when the dog eats it. He waits for it to come out of the other end, but when he goes off to clean it, somebody else mistakes it for some kind of a chocolate candy. I'm sure you could picture the rest. It was gross, but it was funny. ""American Wedding"" cannot be called a classic, but I guess it is worth the hour and a half that it takes. I have mixed feelings, and I didn't really care for it that much, but it was ok.

I was glad to see that Stifler was more of a main character in this movie...because he is always good for several laughs...and the whole mess-up with the flowers shows that Stifler is a multidementional character...not just one who likes to antagonize everyone.

The only thing I was disappointed by was that the character of OZ wasn't brought back into the fold. It kind of left him up in the air.

1496965,3,B00005JMCT,"There's always a good way to end a great trilogy, and that's by a wedding. Most people say that American Pie the Wedding isn't great as the previous two, and nothing can beat the first one. But the finale to this movie is really sweet and romantic, and will definitely get the girls all a bit teary - well, me anyway!
You've got all the great characters from the first two - Jim, Michelle (they're kinda needed for this movie), Stifler, Finch, Kevin, and Jim's Dad, who's part seems to get extended with each movie, as he's so fantastic. But you're also missing quite a few of the cast members - Chris Klein, Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth and Tara Reid. And Stifler's Mom only appears for the last couple of scenes, which see her reunited with Finch, in a bath full of bubbles. Who knows why those four didn't want to take part in this (hopefully) final part of American Pie? They were all much needed and very funny characters, and it would have been nice to see how the characters had developed over the three years that Jim and Michelle had apparently been dating.
Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan are back to their best in this movie, whether it's trying to write their vows, or having special haircuts. Alyson's hair is now longer, and looks a lot better than when it was in that awful bob, when she was definitely still a band geek.
You're introduced to quite a few new characters in this movie - Michelle's sister, who Finch and Stifler both fancy, and both try to outdo each other to win her affections, which provides some comic moments, when they seem to switch characters! There is also Jim's Gran, who gets offended at the fact Michelle isn't Jewish (never been an issue in the previous movies, so there's obviously been something cut out somewhere).  You also get some cringe-worthy (for girls) or sexy (for the guys) scenes featuring two strippers - one a dominatrix cop (whatever), and the other a prissy maid? There's a lot of breast action in this sequence, and of course, any nice eye candy for the girls is left out. There's also Stifler in a gay bar, which is hilarious for the dancing alone, and him not even realising he's in a gay bar!
The uncut and unrated DVD is probably better to get. If you've seen it previously in the cinema, then you'll see lots of missing scenes, in-jokes etc. If this is your first viewing, then it won't really matter to you, that it's 8 minutes longer than in the cinemas and contains 17 minutes of `spiced up' footage - and all those 17 minutes seem to be included in the bachelor party sequence with the strippers. Whoopee.
The outtakes and deleted scenes in the extras aren't really up to much. One of the strippers ""Nikki"" shows you behind the scenes of the bachelor party, and a cameraman gets to follow her around while she prepares for the big premier. You've also got Seann William Scott introducing a few of the deleted scenes and also a feature on ""Stifler Speak"", in which you get to see his original audition for the role of Stifler.
A great finale to a trilogy, but only see if you've seen the previous two - and you'll probably end up being disappointed.",1076544000,,3120,4.512367491166078

1496967,4,B00005JMCT,"Until today, my life was missing one thing. One unique moment that truly set itself apart from all previous others. That moment? Watching Seann William Scott's character, Steve Stifler, eating a dog doo truffle in the latest ""American Pie"" installment : ""American Wedding"". Now you might think that a film with a heinous stunt like this in it's content, would be nothing short of repellant. But I assure you that between dry heaves, you're own body will be ravished by uncontrollable laughter. Stifler, who is undeniably the anchor of all three pictures, comes alive in this outing and solidifies a place as one one of the most unforgettable characters of the last decade and obviously the funniest. There are, however, a few instances in which Seann's portrayal of a tactless, out of control & oversexed jock feels a bit contrived, but overall he does a solid job providing 2,000 Lbs. of hilarity. Another character that completely stands out, is that of Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). The scenes in which he is trying to depict a bad boy facsimile of Stifler, are some of the most memorable. Now you might notice the absence of some of the core cast members from the first two films; namely Chris Klien, Tara Reid and Mena Suvari. But ""Wedding"" seems to work well despite this. Among the returning cast are Scott, Thomas, Eugene Levy (Mr. Levinstein), Thomas Ian Nicholas (Kevin), Jason Biggs (Jim) and Alyson Hannigan (Michelle). Yet, the presence of the engaged couple (Biggs & Hannigan) is virtually non-exsistent, especially since the entire movie is constructed around their wedding and the events leading up to it. In fact in most of the funniest scenes, i.e. the dog poo truffle, the bachelor party, the cadent gay club dance sequence, Biggs is practically nowhere to be found. But Scott and Thomas take up the reins and somehow it all comes together, as once again the film makers have created a disgustingly depraved shock-fest that also manages to come across as innocent and sweet (We actually see Stifler pining over the cute, virginal but horny Cadence, played by January Jones). Quite an acheivement in the over-saturated market of teen to twenty-something sex comedies, most of which are completely devoid of any true heart. ""American Wedding"" is the culmination of an outstanding trilogy of must see comedies from which fans of the first two films will no doubt procure particular enjoyment.",1075939200,,2410,4.967821782178218
1496968,3,B00005JMCT,"When sequels reach their third installment, it's more like nostalgia or tradition that makes me want to see it.  That's the case with American Wedding.  It doesn't live up to it's hilarious predecessors, but it's still a fun trip with the characters that you've come to enjoy.
In this installment, Jim and Michelle plan their wedding, with just a little help from their friends.  What started out as a one-joke character in part one, Stiffler, returns as still a one-joke character.  In this instance, however, he is really over the top to the point that he was no longer funny.  Perhaps that was the intention, however, as it became clear that he was the only member of this cast who hasn't matured in the past four years.  It allowed room for him to grow, and he did, a little bit.
While Stiffler is a negative in this film, the other characters were funny and charming as usual.  The storyline fit nicely into the trilogy and made for a fine conclusion.  Unfortunately, sequels are often compared to it's predecessors, and this one fails.  It lacks that one big scene the other two movies had and it lacked some of the sentimental storytelling as well.
While I enjoyed it as a stand alone movie, it's truly for the die-hard American Pie fans.",1075852800,,1245,4.622727272727273
1496969,2,B00005JMCT,"Why must hollywood ruin everything? This is the final chapter in the American Pie movies & that's a good thing. Part of the problem with the last two 'Pie' movies is that there isn't much original material. They all follow the same formula: Humilate Jason Biggs, Stifler is the comedy & also does something disgusting (ex. eat dog poop), Finch & Stifler's mom, Jim's talks with his dad, & some blatent nudity scenes that don't need to be there.
The original was new, fresh, and a genius of a movie. This one is just awful. If you like Stifler, however, this is your movie. Don't get me wrong, I think he's hilarious at times. The other two films gave you his humor in doses. In this flick he is given free reign and he is sometimes irritating. I mean what 23 year old is still going to act like that? Honestly, I don't care about the marriage. You never get a romantic feel from the little chemistry Jason Biggs & Alyson Hannigan have. I don't even know why Thomas Ian Nichols is in this movie. He doesn't have much to do here. Eddie Kaye is back as Finch. Even his character is getting old. And if I have to hear about him & Stifler's mom again, I am going to throw up. Even the bachelor party (a.k.a. the nudity) felt forced. Does Jim only have three friends in his life? And the 'relationship' between Stifler and Michelle's sister is idiotic. There is NO WAY that a girl would go out with him after he treats her like he does in this movie. But, welcome to hollywood.
The movie is not a total loss, though. Jim's dad is back and as funny as ever. Stifler does have some really funny moments. His attempt at wooing Michelle's sister are quite funny. January Jones is incredibly hot. And that's about it.
The only reason I bought this movie was because I wanted the trilogy. I think it's the worst of the three, by far. I wasn't all that crazy about part two either, but at least it FELT like an American Pie movie. It had all of the characters (even though some were just there for show), & it had some funny moments for the other characters. This film is all about Stifler & it falls flat. It should have never been made in the first place. I can't recommend this movie for more than a rental.
Even the special features are somewhat disappointing. There are deleted scenes, outtakes, bachelor party featurette, a cheesy wedding video, etc. Nothing special here.",1075766400,3,2365,4.414187643020595

1496972,2,B00005JMCT,"This film really is pushing it. In my opinion it shouldn't have been made - it does nothing to progress and mature the series, in fact, most of the characters have managed to regress from the previous movie - they don't seem to have done anything at all in the 3 years after the 2nd film and the dissaperance of the half of the cast that didn't return is totally unexplained. Theres no mention of Oz in the film at all, even though he was supposed to be their good friend. There just doesn't seem to have been any development in the characters since the last film, is the point I'm trying to make.
It falls far short of matching the comedy of the other two films. The gags came out as unbelievable and simply just forced in an attempt to make the 3rd instalment even more 'gross out' than the previous two. Thats not to say that most of the gags aren't funny, because they are, its just that they come across as very tiresome , which is why they fall short of being hilarious - you just feel like you've seen it before. I have no idea how the hell so many people can say that this film is better than the first two. The charm seems to have gone, the humour seems to have just been rehashed from the first two films and some of the characters just seem there out of obligation, Kevin and Jims Dad for example, I don't think Eugene Levey got even one funny line in this film.(He might have actually, I'm only posting this review after the first time I've watched it, a few hours ago / but the point is, that Eugene's talents just seem to have been wasted here).
Overall it comes off very tired and awkward, it left me a little dissapointed. By no means is it an awful film, it just strikes me as a bit of a letdown considering how good the other two films were. I won't bother putting any of the positive parts of the film here, partly because I can't be bothered to type anymore, but also because - it all seems to have been said before in all of these rave 5 star reviews posted by people who've seemingly watched a completely different version of this film to me. But I'll award it 3 stars anyways, its still funny and Stifler definately suceeds in stealing the film by being 'totally insane'(or mentally ill, whichever way you'd prefer to see it) as stated by Seann on the extras of the dvd. But by no means is this a classic teen-comedy - its just such a shame that this franchise has to be exploited so much.",1075593600,,2412,4.234273318872018

1497083,2,B00005JMCT,"Of course there are laughs in this third installment of the ""American Pie"" series, but we have seen them all before. Every joke here seems recycled from the previous two films. We should have known that this movie would not live up to the high expectations set by the original two, since half the actors from the originals decided to take a pass on ""Wedding"". I can't blame them, because reading the script must have reminded them exactly of the first two.
I thought that after ""American Pie 2"" the producers would make a movie just for Stiffler, but watching ""Wedding"" made me realize how he cannot carry a movie all by himself. He is way over the top in this one, and becomes more annoying in the end than anything. He actually tries to redeem himself, and this is terrible for his character, because we loved him because he was not a good person, and did not want to be a good person. He can still swear with the best of them, but even the joy of the F-word is sucked out by the end of this movie.
If you feel like completely shutting off your brain for a little while, then this movie is not that bad, but it cannot be argued that this is the least funny of the three, and there is little of the surprising heart that made the other two decent films.
""American Wedding"" is a perfect example of a studio flogging a dead horse, and hopefully we will not see an American Honeymoon or American Divorce.",1074816000,,1402,4.334600760456274

The acting in this film was of similar nature to its predecessors, and the jokes were in the same vein. Overall, however, I feel that this film did not live up to the legacy created by the original.

Like the first two movies, this one is an average comedy with some funny characters who can make for the lack of a decent and creative plot. The jokes haven`t changed, going from predictable slapstick to utterly childish stuff, and for the most part the laughs are forced as they deal with trivial, unsurprising situations. Even though Jim is the one who`s getting married, Stifler seems to be the central character here, getting all the attention and acting in a particularly annoying way. But I knew what to expect anyway, so this isn`t much of a disappointment, although it`s probably the worst movie of the series.

In the shadow of continuous blunders, Jim's father (Eugene Levy) is spicing up the slap-stick humor with his intentional good-will.  Despite the jokes, the story falls flat on it's face because it consists of one silly joke on top of another which prevents it from taking off.

Finch continues to nail his roll, and will keep you grinning.  The rest of the cast doesn't really excel, though they all manage to pull off respectable performances.  But they were all more interesting in the first 2 films.",1074211200,,541,5.01123595505618
1497091,2,B00005JMCT,"In this third and final installment in the ""American Pie"" trilogy, Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are planning to get married. Jim, still as disaster-prone as ever, must convince Michelle's parents that he is worthy of their daughter's hand and go to great lengths to give his bride the wedding of her dreams. Stifler (Seann William Scott) plans a raunchy bachelor party, while he and Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) both try to woo Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones), who is in town for the wedding.

""American Wedding"" was directed by Jesse Dylan, who is new to the ""American Pie"" franchise. It was written by Adam Herz, who created the characters and wrote the original ""American Pie ""  movie. So it's a little surprising that "" American Wedding"" possesses none of the charm that the first film did. ""American Pie"" succeeded, not only because it was funny, but because the characters were lovable and their plight sympathetic. Jim, Finch, Stifler, Kevin, and Michelle are back for this film, but their characters are barely written. If they convey anything at all, it is pathological self-importance. Stifler was always an egomaniacal jerk who had an inflated opinion of himself, and that was funny. In ""American Wedding"" he is too obnoxious for words and comes across as actually being mentally ill, which isn't funny. The jokes are forced. The situations are less believable and consequently less entertaining than in ""American Pie"" or ""American Pie 2"". There's nothing in ""American Wedding"" that will strike a chord with the audience as being an authentic, if exaggerated, take on the emotional or social experiences of young people today. It's just bad writing. Eugene Levy, who added so much to the first two ""American Pie"" films, is wasted on this one. His lines aren't funny. The unrated version of the film contains extra footage from Jim's bachelor party. More boobs, essentially. How can you have a bunch of young men and two barely-clad women in a room and.... nothing funny? Lots of cleavage, little writing. Recommended as a rental only if you've seen the first two and don't want to be left ignorant of the conclusion.

The DVD: On the downside, there are 3 previews which cannot be avoided. Happily, both the R-rated theatrical version of the film and the unrated version are on the same disc. Bonus features include: deleted scenes, blooper reel, a featurette on ""Stifler Speak"", a featurette on the making of ""The Bachelor Party"" scenes, a ""making of"" Jim's grooming scene. And there are two commentaries, one by director Jesse Dylan and actor Seann William Scott, and the other by actors Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Kay thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas. If you really like Stifler, you might enjoy the ""Stifler Speak"" featurette. And there are more boobs in ""The Bachelor Party"" piece. But, truthfully, these are appropriately uninteresting bonus features for an unfortunately uninteresting movie.",1074038400,3,2951,5.067901234567901

1497171,1,B00005JMCT,"I won't go into the movie. Those who have seen it know it's a funny, yet heart-warming story in the end. The movie itself I would give about 3.5 stars. American Pie 1 and 2 are better, but AW is NOT a bad movie and is still an excellent final chapter to the entire American Pie series. My qualms lie with what Universal Studios has chosen to do with the ads, and it occured with a previous Universal DVD release, Animal House.
The AW DVD has some features that are cool, including deleted scenes and the Unrated version goes into why they created an unrated version. What I also like with the unrated DVD release is that you have both the theatrical release and the unrated version. I think that's an excellent marketing ploy. The extra scenes are okay, but I don't know if they are totally worth it except one part where Finch, Kevin and Stifler are asked if they would like to see the two strippers kiss. Their answer to it is hilarious and it pays a great homage to AP2.
But, the one annoying thing about this DVD (as it is with the Animal House DVD) and is the only reason I gave the DVD a 1-star rating, is the commercials. Now, supposedly, unlike the Animal House DVD, you can skip the commercials. Yet, I was unable to skip them with my particular DVD player except by stopping the movie and then restarting it. This is better than my Animal House DVD, in which my only recourse was to turn off the DVD player.
So, if you don't mind having the commercials thrown into your face and you haven't seen this movie, I would suggest possibly renting it first to see if you want it. I myself have already written my displeasure with Animal House and American Wedding to Universal. I have a feeling this is the route they will continue to take, which is sad as I have other Universal movies on DVD that I enjoy. However, if enough consumers write to them and complain, hopefully they will listen and change their tactics.
Again, the movie is funny and great (3.5 stars), but the DVD release with the adds forced upon the viewer is what kills the rating for this release. In fact, if we had the option, this DVD would have possibly gotten a zero from me. And believe me, I LOVE my movies!",1073952000,2,2186,4.34718826405868

1497173,3,B00005JMCT,"I really should dislike this movie, because the comedy is even more disgusting and base than the previous movies in this series, but when the movie is funny, it's hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing.  Be warned, however, that much of the humor comes from gross situations.
In this edition, Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs) asks Michelle Flaherty (Alysson Hannigan) to marry him.  The big moment is to happen in a very nice restaurant.  Jim hints that he wants to ask Michelle a very important question, and his hinting about is misinterpreted by Michelle, who crawls under the table to do what she thinks Jim wants.  In the mean time, Jim's dad, played by SCTV alumni Joe Levy, shows up and sits in Michelle's chair, unaware that she is under the table.  Michelle goes unnoticed until Jim's dad mentions the wedding proposal, which causes Michelle to bump the underside of the table.  Jim jumps up, his pants are down, and it's embarrassment and pandemonium.  As funny as this scene is, it gets better, or worse, depending on how you look at it, from there.
The movie ends up being a series of gags from beginning to end, that are both funny and often disgusting.  Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) is often involved in many of these scenes.  In one scene Steve and Jim are in the library with a dog when an accident with a cake happens.  When Jim's dad opens the library door to bring in Michelle's parents, Steve and Jim appear to be in a very bizarre position with respect to the dog.  You'll have to see this one to understand it or believe it.
There are another pair of scenes that are related involving a gay bar, a bachelor party, with Stifler involved, of course, and Michelle's parents.  While not every moment of these scenes are funny, they are in several places, and I found myself laughing all the way through the scene where Jim is supposed to be having dinner at home with Michelle's parents.
Stifler manages to get himself invited to the wedding, and even manages to convince Michelle's mother to let him carry the wedding ring.  Unfortunately Stifler manages to lose the ring, which a small dog then eats.  How Stifler gets the ring back is simultaneously funny and gross.
While Stifler acts like the jerk he is for much of the movie, near the end we see Stifler make a mistake, and then pull out the stops to correct his error.  For just a moment we get to see Stifler actually act like a human, and the movie turns out all right.
I watched many of the extra features on the DVD.  The two features I thought were the best were the deleted scenes and the outtakes.  Watch them after seeing the movie.
I gave this movie three stars even though it was a laugh-fest all the way through.  Much of the humor is gross and disgusting, and the situations used to get the laughs are totally unrealistic and bizarre (well, none of these have ever happened to anyone I know).  If you enjoyed the first two ""American Pie"" movies, you'll enjoy this one as well.  Definitely not a family movie and many adults will find portions of the movie a bit too bizarre to be enjoyable.  However, for those who like Mad Magazine and can handle gross jokes, this movie is a blast.",1073520000,5,3174,4.533333333333333

Bittersweet because only half of the cast has returned (no Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, or Natasha Lyonne), but the film is surprisingly better without them.  American Wedding finds Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) graduating college and preparing to marry, but not before Stifler (Seann William Scott) can hatch a bachelor party and nearly ruin the nuptuals.  Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Eugene Levy as Jim's dad return to add to the comic relief, even though Nicholas is hardly used at all.  Plenty of mishaps ensue naturally, and American Wedding almost becomes more of Scott's film (his performance goes from irritating to hilarious in the span of the film), but some of the gags (come on, the dog poop?) seem way out of place.

Although a lot of the cast from the first one didn't return, the movie is still hilarious. When you think about it, the ones that returned are the ones that made the movies so strong in the first place anyway. Okay Shannon Elizibeth isn't back and yes she is sexy but  she was awful in the last one. Chris Klein played the normal one of the gang....so who needs him lol. They should've at least mentioned his character once though since he was supposed to be their good friend.
  Anyway the movie would be totally pointless if Sean William Scott didn't return as Stiffler. Okay he has a little too much screen time and that laugh he does can get annoying too. However the movie smartly handles his character. He's supposed to be an annoying big mouthed jerk. That's why Jim (Jason Biggs) doesn't want him at his wedding. So Stiffler does everything he can to be part of the wedding. All that is hilarious too. We also get to see that he has a bit of a sensitive side a long the way as well.
  The scenes where Finch ( Eddie Kaye Thomas)  acts like Stiffler in-order to impress Michelle's sister is very funny too. Stiffler and Finch both have eyes for the same girl. Stiffler thinks he needs to act like Finch to get her and Finch thinks he needs to act like Stiffler. The result is hilarious. Lugene Levy (Jim's dad) is another strong point of the all the movies and they'd be boring without his pep talks that always embarrass Jim as well.

Though, in order to do so they have had to dumb down his character even more so than in the first two films.
I did not find ""American Wedding"" hilarious, but it certainly has enough laughs to keep the pace light and fast.

1497279,2,B00005JMCT,"It's not a horrible way to spend two hours but really isn't anything special and I was very very disappointed.
American PIE had its share of gimmick jokes and gross out jokes, but it managed to combine them with relevance and SEXINESS!!
American WEDDING doesn't even try to be sexy. Which was a huge part of the success of American Pie. It was SEXY and FUNNY! We had a handful of beautiful girls and guys in REALISTIC, funny and SEXY moments.
American Wedding on the other hand, has NONE of that. Stiffler (Scott) pretends to be somebody else in order to beat out Finch (Thomas) and get into Michelle's (Alyson Hannigan) sister Cadence's (the very attractive January Jones) pants. This story line takes up about 70% of the movie and nobody actually does. It's like telling a story an entire movie and never delivering with the punchline. Instead we end up with a sex scene with Grandma.
The American Pie movies have made a lot of money for their studio. You'd think that they'd have the green light to do WHATEVER they wanted... and they did!
Well, they chose to use that power to do jokes typical of JACKASS like eating dog poo, dancing in gay bars, having sex with grandma, humping dogs and shaving pubic hair.
Me personally, I would have rather seen the sexiness brought back. Bottom line. American Wedding ISN'T sexy. It's mostly GROSS with some laughs. In fact, on the DVD, the Director even says that the studio recommended they add something to make it sexier. Preferably with Cadence, and they didn't.
The unrated version does feature an extended bachelor party. It isn't that big of deal. Would have rather seen Cadence do something MILDLY sexy. I mean, didn't January Jones see what American Pie did for Shannon Elizabeth, Mena Suvari and Tara Reid's careers!",1073260800,3,1769,4.728155339805825
1497280,4,B00005JMCT,"You cannot accuse ""American Wedding"" of false advertising on the basis of the cover of the DVD, because the character of Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) is featured prominently, right in the center.  Yes, it is rather amazing how the joke character from the original ""American Pie"" has taken over the series, and pretty much every memorable moment in this 2003 film belongs to Stifler.  But I am a fan of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and so I want to point out to director Jesse Dylan that he has Allyson Hannigan in this movie and why not take advantage of that fact and give her some good scenes?  After all, this is the actress who had the two biggest lines in the original ""American Pie"" (the second of which was ad-libbed).  But you can make the same argument for Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, and most of the cast in this one (and why is Thomas Ian Nicholas even back as Kevin?  He has nothing to do in this film).
The title is pretty much the plot of this film, as Jim (Biggs) proposes to Michelle (Hannigan), under the traditionally embarrassing situation we have come to expect from every major moment in Jim's life.  Michelle wants the perfect wedding and Jim promises her one, which means learning to dance.  Michelle's parents show up when Jim is having another one of his embarrassing situations, which means he has to redeem himself.  But the person who most needs redemption is Stifler, who is not invited to the wedding and does not deal well with rejection.  However, even the upcoming nuptials take a back seat when Stifler meets Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones) and tries to act like a human being in order to seduce her.  Meanwhile, Finch (Eddie Haye Thomas) is impressing Cadence by acting like Stifler and we are have totally jumped through the looking glass, boys and girls.
Consequently, in ""American Wedding"" Stifler reaches hitherto unsuspected heights as he starts thinking with totally different body parts than is his standard operating procedure.  It is totally appropriate, given all the horrible things that have happened to Stifler in the previous films, that in this one he does the worst one yet, to himself, and on purpose.  You have to stop and think about it a while to realize that Stifler is having an actuabl moment of nobility (the first of maybe two or three).  Otherwise, outside of Samuel L. Jackson when one of his characters goes to town, Steve Stifler is the Picasso of profanity (with credit for the creativity of his profanity being shared between Seann William Scott and writer Adam Herz).
Besides, when I start complaining that ""American Wedding"" did have enough sweet moments between Jim and Michelle, who is going to agree with me?  People watch the ""American Pie Trilogy"" for the vulgarity, both verbal and visual, so it seems rather ungracious to ask for something more (but they really should not have wasted Allyson Hannigan like this).",1073260800,,2909,4.792

1497287,4,B00005JMCT,"Here we go again. The summer season always starts off so promising with such big event films as this year's X2: X-Men United, The Matrix Reloaded, and Finding Nemo bringing in the masses for some solid entertainment. But as the season goes on, more and more films are released that don't seem to quite live up to the films the summer started off with. And finally as we arrive to the final month of summer fun, the studios seem to repeat their ploy for the summer in this one month. After the surprising success of The Sixth Sense in August 1999 as well as the success of films like Signs and xXx in the same time period three years later, the studios have began to stand up and take notice that the last month of the summer doesn't have to be entirely disastrous. With the right story as well as a decent marketing campaign, a studio can still open a film big in the first two weeks of the month while dumping any low budget trash in the closing weeks of the summer. Since there seems to be no Shyamalan film in sight this year, Universal is willing to fill up the slot with the third, and possibly final, installment of their successful American Pie series. After the surprising success of the original in 1999, the box office saw the rebirth of the teen sex comedy genre though few films following in the foot steps of the American Pie film failed to match up. After a successful sequel in 2001, the cast comes together one more time to serve up a slice of pie to the movie-going public. But in a time when sequels have underperformed at the box office, will American Wedding be able to break the curse or will there be nothing but wedding time blues?
The story centers around the marriage of Jim and Michelle as the rest of the American Pie clan clamors to get ready for the big day. The sexual confused group of kids from East Great Falls High has finally grown up and two of them are readying to take the big step into matrimony but there seems to be problems around every corner. Jim, who has subjected himself to a huge amount of public humiliation, has enough trouble trying to please Michelle's parents but soon realizes he has another problem: He can't dance. While Jim tries to figure out how to dance, his friends, Kevin and Finch, try to control Stifler, who seems to have plans of his own for the big day. Not only is he excited to through a bachelor party for Jim, with strippers of course, but eyes Michelle's younger sister, Cadence, who just happens to be a virgin. Like the previous American Pie films, things just seem to go from bad to worse as the day draws closer. The story for American Wedding seems to take itself seriously more then the previous efforts which works wonderfully. Even with that said, the film does seem to offer plenty of gross out humor that continues to surprising even the hardcore American Pie fans. Some of the gross out humor, as funny as it is, is a little too much especially one or more scenes involving Stifler, which the film seems to focus on more then in previous ventures.
Though several cast members of the original two films don't make appearances in this film, the remaining cast works well enough together that you barely notice the changes. Jason Biggs, who has subjected himself to public humiliation involving a pie as well as superglue, continues his hilarious antics in the third installment in the series that made him famous, in more ways then one. Biggs should have a real promising comedy career seeing that he is willing to do anything for a film including making himself look like a weirdo especially in scenes that showing off his rear end. Alyson Hannigan, who returns as Michelle, isn't given as much screen time as she should have had but when she is featured; she gives the film its heart which greatly needed outside of the gross humor. Sean William Scott, who returns as the eccentric Stifler, seems to subject himself to as much humiliation as Jason Biggs including a scene to that is so disgusting and so funny that you won't believe it even when you do see it. Though the character of Stifler seems to be focused on more then in the previous films, he isn't focused on too much that film distracts the audience from the real story. The real highlight of every American Pie film has to be Eugene Levy, who returns as Jim's father. Levy, who was the only real funny character in the comedy Bringing Down the House earlier this year, is absolutely hilarious as usual and will hopefully have a long and fruitful comedy career outside of this franchise should this be the last film. The only part of the cast that didn't seem to work well was Thomas Ian Nicholas as Kevin. He doesn't really do much for the film and, in fact, doesn't really even say much through the course of the two hour feature. Why was he included while other members of the cast were cut? Did they really need all the male leads back for the last film? Is that why he was included? There really seems to be no clear answer.
Overall, American Wedding is the one sequel this year that seems to outshine the previous efforts. Though the film is an achievement in that area, there are a few things to pick at. One of those things includes the number of cast members from the original films that were cut from this film. No clear explanation is given to why certain members of the original cast are not invited to the wedding. In fact, they are barely even mentioned outside of a passing note of Nadia. This isn't a big factor but does seem to pick at the back of the minds of a few fans. Another small problem about the film is some of the gross out humor. Though many of the scenes are very funny and don't seem to be retreads of scenes from the two prior films, some of gross out humor seems to be too much to take in especially the scene involving Stifler's search for the lost wedding ring. Outside of those small problems, American Wedding is the best comedy of the summer as well as the year so far. If this is the last film in the American Pie series, it is a wonderful thing to know that the comedy franchise went out on a huge high note.",1072828800,2,6092,4.43048128342246

1497377,4,B00005JMCT,"American Wedding, the third ""American Pie"" film, is loaded with alot of sex jokes and toilet humor (what passes for high-end comedy today) but I still laughed at most of them. That is probably the reason why this series is so popular.
American Wedding manages to make low brow humor appealing to a mass audience without making the whole film an exercise in stupidity. The cast does an excellent job and the writers create some really funny situations.",1072828800,,451,4.794871794871795
1497378,3,B00005JMCT,"With American Pie II, producer Chris Moore and writer Adam Herz accomplished something exceedingly rare - a sequel that was even funnier than the original. The characters actually grew deeper, you cared about them more, you got a deeper insight into their behavior, and it was, well, just *funnier*.
With American Wedding, unfortunately, they fell far short of matching anything near the comedy of the other two. Much of the original cast is missing, which didn't bother me too much since Oz (Chris Klein), Vicky (Tara Reid) and Heather (Mena Suvari) were my least favorite characters. (But I think we all missed Nadia.) The missing cast members weren't really the problem in American Wedding, however. The problem was that the characters became paper-thin stereotypes of themselves. We saw obligatory knock-off jokes from the first two. There's not much worse than a writer/producer team riding on their own coattails as opposed to actually coming up with something new and original. In part 2, Jim glued himself to...himself, so in part 3 we need another genitalia mishap. In part 2 Stifler got peed on, so in part 3 there was something involving feces. In general the humor in American Wedding is just rewritten scenes from one of the first two movies. There's very little new or original here.
The most disappointing was Stifler (Sean William Scott) whom most of us love. I find it amazing that his character actually *regressed* from where it was in the original installment. Herz did a great job of creating a unique character in Stifler, the guy you all knew and hated in high school. He was not only funny but not an exact stereotype. In American Wedding he is a completely clich&eacute;d version of himself - he acts so stupid that you wonder if there's something wrong with him. Literally, they have him acting like he needs medical attention. It turns out that Stifler is featured in the movie more than any other, which would be great if they had given him any funny lines or scenes.
In the end American Wedding is certain to please some, but I would save your money on the DVD. It just isn't going to have that repeat-watchability that the first two have.",1072828800,,2168,4.815013404825737
1497379,3,B00005JMCT,"It's quite interesting they call this DVD a ""unrated extended party edition."" I love the raunchiness of the the ""Pie"" series. My favorite is having Shannon Elizabeth going topless in the original ""Pie."" Fans won't be dissapointed because ""American Wedding"" has plenty of topless scenes, sure to have you begging for more! Remember the bachelor party scene with the two babes nude? Well there's more of that in the 'unrated' editon!
Anyway, this third entry is alright. Jim gets married to the girl from band camp. The wedding plans turn out to be a disaster, but in 'Pie' fashion, they do tie the knot. Half of the young cast from the previous two movies are gone, and that's probably the downpoint. I miss Shannon Elizabeth! She should of had a cameo by ruining the wedding and running off with Jim! That would have been a better plotline.
But Stifler(Seann William Scott) is the savior here. He's funny because he's in this film alot. He pratically stoled the show despite being more stupid and nasty then in the first two movies combined. This rude and arrogant character should have his own movie series. Well enjoy the DVD.

This third installment of the very popular teen series is keyed by the wedding part in the title. Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Allison Hannigan) are ready to get married. With Stiffler (Sean W. Scott) not invited, they feel the wedding should go off with a bang. WRONG. Stiffler shows up and thats when the trouble starts. This chapter in the 'Pie' series is horrible. They try to make gross out, laugh-out-loud humor, but most of it falls flat on it's face. Sean W. Scott tries to save this disaster, but even 'The Stiffmeister' can't save this dud. The film starts with so much promise, it looks as if they actually could make it work, make a absolutely hilarious 'Pie' with more heart than the first two, then it falls. Again and again. The most memorable character 'Stiffler' isn't memorable at all in this edition. I was kind of sad to hear them ending the series, but after this last installment, I'm kinda glad.

1497382,3,B00005JMCT,"The final end to the American Pie saga.  I saw this movie after hearing great reviews from the critics and was expecting it to be the best one of them all.  I was undoubtfully wrong.  There are alot of problems with this movie that the others didn't have.  It seemed in this one the creators were trying way too hard for some cheap laughs than in the other ones where the awkward and surprising situations the characters got themselves into were the funniest.  Every character hits the mark right on in this one, except for Sean Williams Scott.  It came as a shock to me because like many others, Stifler is my favorite and most rememorable character.  But in this movie, Mr. Scott is completely overacting and Stifler therefore seems way to over the top.  So over the top that it makes you not want to watch him, more less care about him.  There are some few funny scenes in the movie.  The most funniest are of course the most outrageous.  But between those parts it is undeniably slow.  For instance, Stifler mistakingly enters a gay bar and shows off his dancing moves.  It wasn't funny at all and seemed like a scene that should be obviously deleted to the cutting room floor and never seen again.  It's that type of humor that seems so forced that makes the movie at some points a pain to sit through.  But the movie does end on a good note to one of the most famous ""American Teen"" comedies of this time.",1072224000,,1411,4.3938223938223935
1497383,5,B00005JMCT,"I gave this movie 5 bright stars for keeping right in line with the other American Pie flicks. The original cast of characters pull off another great performance. If you liked the first 2 in the series then without a doubt you will love this one (as it on the same premise).
Also, girls an added feature for us- since we like love stories with happy endings- they actually get married and have a commitment to each other. But guys don't worry because it does not distract from this largely hilaroius movie. I would have to say I luaghed more during this than during the other 2.
The ONLY WARNING I have for those thinking about buying this movie is that just like the other movies within the series, it is not meant for children or young teenagers who cannot grasp it's concepts or tell the difference between true life and fiction.

Yes, as you probably heard the whole cast didn't return for the conclusion to the Pie trilogy but to tell you the truth I didn't even notice they were missing.  The movie also didn't follow the same format as it's predecessors...yes, Jim was caught in every un-imaginable sexually related scenario but this movie was a freshly baked slice of pie.
I swear this one has to be the raunchiest of them all.  In the end though it made me want to fall in love (man I'm in love with Alyson Hannigan, damn she is getting married in real life :-(, it really did a good job pulling at the 'ole heart strings.  Right from the first Pie I knew these two (Jim and Michelle) where going to elope, truly a match made in movie heaven...
 There were many unexpected things in this movie including the fact that all the funny scenes where not in the previews.  Stifler's other side shows, believe it, he's not as shallow as you may have thought.  And this movie is a great ""what not to do guide for the groom.""  For being a sequel it was actually comparable to the first installment, if not funnier.
It is kind of sad really, no more sexual misadventures of Jim or any other of the American Pie crew for that matter...unless they decide to make it into a new TV series.  Hey it's possible, have you seen what they are putting on the TV nowadays, this would actually be an improvement.  Got off topic there for a second...well my recommendation is to go see this movie, sure you don't need the big screen to enjoy a movie such as this but who can wait till it comes out on DVD (your going to want to buy it anyway, not rent it especially when they come out with the deluxe unrated collectors edition of the American Pie series with 500 hours of never before seen raunchy footage).  All right back to our regularly scheduled day...",1071273600,,2078,4.302564102564102
1497456,4,B00005JMCT,"Since 1999, we've all gotten a chance to know and love the ""American Pie"" gang, with all their true to life gaffes and foibles and the genuine goodness of their efforts.  Now, four years after the `fab four' from East Great Falls cemented their pact to lose their virginities by prom night, one of their number, Jim (who also did unspeakable things to apple pie in that first film), is getting married to his infamous `band camp' girlfriend, Michelle (Alyson Hanningan).  After two films of watching poor Jim (Jason Biggs) have every bad thing possible happen to him in his quest to gain sexual experience, it's nice to finally have Jim get it right and make the big trip down the aisle (though, the path there is no less hilarious).

""American Wedding"" brings about half of the original cast back for one last go as Jim and Michelle take the final plunge.  It's good to see Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and, yes, even Stiffler (Sean William Scott), again.  Though, the absence of the others ranges from understandable to downright mystifying.  Kevin's ex-girlfriend, Vicki (formerly played by Tara Reid), really would have no place in this movie.  They broke up at the end of the first film and made peace with their respective directions in life at the end of the second.  So, her absence makes sense; as does the lack of the famous foreign exchange student, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth); although we do miss her.  The glaring omissions from this film are supercouple Oz and Heather (played by Chris Klein and Mena Suvari).  Their relationship was still going strong at the end of ""American Pie 2"" and they both were still integral parts of this group of friends.  One can only surmise that Klein and Suvari both felt that a third film was beneath them.  Hopefully, there's a better explanation than this because that would be disappointing.

Issues with the casting aside, ""American Wedding"" still manages to embrace the heart of this series while losing very little of the humor.  At the very beginning of the movie, when Jim is preparing to propose to Michelle in a romantic restaurant, they end up in the kind of compromising situation that could only happen to Jim.  Once they are engaged, the challenge becomes planning the perfect wedding, Jim learning how to dance, and Jim meeting and trying to win the approval of Michelle's parents (played by Deborah Rush and the always amusing Fred Willard).  Separately, these are very daunting tasks. Together, they are even more taxing.  When you add the unwelcome presence of Steve Stiffler forcefully inviting himself to the wedding, it has reached a critical mass where nothing but bad things can happen.  Of course, this is Jim's wedding, so things will definitely go wrong.  He can't seem to do anything right to impressing Michelle's parents; he is having a difficult time getting Michelle her dream wedding dress; and, now that Stiffler has wormed his way into the wedding by promising to give Jim the dance lessons he needs, Jim has to keep the `Stiff-meister' reigned in.  Suffice to say, as things get more out of control, the movie gets funnier and funnier.  There is even a scene where Stiffler gets his comeuppance by having a markedly worse experience with a `brownie' than Jim had with a pie.  I believe that when all three movies are looked at, one will see that Stiffler has ended up having bad experiences with every conceivable bodily excretion.

Stiffler was a totally obnoxious bore in the first two films and, if he had continued to be one here, ""American Wedding"" would have bombed.  Fortunately, Sean William Scott does a marvelous job at playing Stiffler as an obnoxious oaf who still has a heart.  Stiffler wants to right and be a better person, he just can't seem to get out of his own cocky way.  His maturity over the course of the film is one of its shining aspects.  He never loses that `Stiff-meister' quality, but he manages to balance with a little more heart.  The roles of Kevin and Finch are essentially window dressing in this film, brought back so that Jim could have his buddies to share in his experience.  However, there is a funny subplot where Finch and Stiffler compete for the affections of Michelle's sister, Cadence (January Jones).  Of course, no ""American Pie"" film would be complete without Jim's dad (the winning Eugene Levy) providing his `unique' brand of advice to help Jim through one of the biggest moments of his life.

""American Wedding"" brings the `saga' of the ""American Pie"" guys full circle and provides a satisfying conclusion to their stories.  Seeing Jim and Michelle on their wedding day makes you feel good for them as you know they will have a sparkling (and very wild) future together.",1071014400,2,4730,4.8012345679012345

Like many people have said, I thought it would be a total letdown without some of the other characters but after watching the movie, I wasn't disappointed at all. To be honest with you all, I truly do believe that this is the BEST movie in the series. This made me laugh my mouth off from start to finish and the plot to the story was incredibly done. I also believe that the actors and actresses put their best effort to make a great ending to the series. However, this does get me questioning: will this movie truly end the series? I highly believe that there will be another one (I'm hoping too) and I'm sure a lot of people out there would want to see another AMERICAN PIE once they see this. There are some funny scenes and scenes you won't want to miss in this movie! The scene where Stifler enjoys the dogs licking his pants has to be the funniest scene I have seen so far this year! The bachelor's party is the best scene by far... see it and you will understand why this is so. The most disgusting scene is where Stifler eats the dog's crap, to save Michelle's mom from eating it (she believes it's chocolate and Michelle's mom loves eating chocolate). It was so disgusting, it put me off my food after seeing that bit but that definately wasn't a let-down to the movie. Another disgusting part which will make you jump off your seats is the part where Stifler is in a rush to meet Cadence in the closet. It's dark so Stifler cannot see and believes Cadence is in there so he starts feeling up ""Cadence"". Eventually, you'll find that Stifler is having sex with... Jim's grandmother when Finch opens up the door! There are some new characters added to the movie, like:
Michelle's hot as blonde sister, Cadence
Michelle's parents
Jim's grandma
and plenty more.
I really enjoyed this movie and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. There are a lot of excellent scenes in here and the movie is just fantastic. I would highly reccommend anyone to see this movie.

THE STORY:
With high school and college behind them Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), knowing they are the ones for each other, decide to get married.  As a result the gang (well, most of them) gets back together to help plan for and get ready for Jim and Michelle's big day.  As is the case when the gang gets together, lots of bad and hilarious things occur.  As an added plotline, Stifler (Sean William Scott) and his eternal nemesis Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) take on each other for the attention of Michelle's hot sister Cadence.
THE COOL THINGS:
Many felt that the movie would lose a step with a lot of the old cast (Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Shannon Elizabeth) not returning.  This is not the case however.  The movie actually became a lot tighter with a lot of the extraneous characters eliminated (as several of these characters only had bit parts in the second film).  The same trademarked sophomoric comedy you love and expect from this series continues to shine through, particularly through Stifler's overwhelming personality.  Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) continues to put on a superb performance as the coolest dad on the planet.  In all, all is right in the world with this film.
BEST SCENES:
1. Stifler and the Dog ""Treat""
2. The Bachelor Party
3. Stifler and Grandma
4. The Proposal
5. Jim and the Cake
6. The ""Dance Off""
THE VERDICT:
Overall, the film doesn't lose a step and the laughs keep rolling when Jim and his boys hit the road.  This is a fitting end to an excellent series.  It's sad to see them go, but I'm glad the series has gone out with a bang rather than a whimper.
Highly Recommended",1062288000,6,1766,4.667741935483871
1497463,3,B00005JMCT,"Well , its finally here - the third installment in the American Pie series. In my opinion this is the best one by far as it as all the elements of a comedy. Even though half the cast is missing (for reasons best know to them), the rest of the gang Jim, Finch, Stifler,Michelle (Bang Camp fame)including the one and only Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad)who always seems to catching his son ""off guard"".
The movie starts off with a very unusual Wedding Proposal scene between Jim and Michelle which ends up into a fiasco... thanks to the Jim's Dad which leads to the planning of the American Wedding - ofcourse not to forget when u have a wedding ur friends want the best for you and if you have friends like Finch and Stifler - God save you. These two in a quest for Cladence (Michelles's sister) turn the movie inside out to see who can win her love. Amercian wedding has some hilarious scenes of Stifler dancing to all time classics in Bar !!! Eating Poo , Doing Jims' Grandmother !!! and a Bachelor Party seriously gone wrong.
I thought this was a great movie and a must see for all American Pie fans...",1062201600,,1096,4.351219512195122
1497554,4,B00005JMCT,"You know how when you first taste a piece of pie, and it's really good, and you think you want more and more of it, but By the time you get to that third slice, the magical quality that made you love it in the first place has waned and it isn't what it used to be at first?. Well, welcome to ""American Wedding"". I'm not gonna say that this doesn't deserve to be in the 'Pie' series, or that it isn't good or enjoyable, because it most definitley is, but there is something missing. I was worried right off the bat when I heard that half the cast, Chris Klein As Oz, Shannon Elizabeth As Nadia, Tara Reid As Vicky, Mena Suvari as Heather, and Natasha Lyonne as Francesca, would be absent from the film. Not only that, but the director's previous comedy was some embarrasing pot comedy. The abscene of the cast is definitley felt, and it's a hard feeling to shed while watching the movie. As the movies have dealt with the progression of relationships and friendships, I guess it is uunderstandable that some friends don't always stay together once they have graduated into adulthood. It happens. Our hero Jim(Jason Biggs), is finally ready to pop the question to band geek/girlfriend Michelle(the adorable Alyson Hannigan), and does so in the film's hilarious opening teaser that stays true to the series' popular, and now famous, opening moments. Jim's best buds Finch(Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Kevin(Thomas Ian Nicholas), are also around, as everyone prepares from the upcoming nuptials. All isn't merry when perennial jock head Stifler(Sean William Scott), stumbles back onto the scene and causes more chaos for the duo as the wedding nears.  Eugene Levy is back as Jim's dad, and he has, thankfully, a larger role here. We even see more of Jim's mom!. Newcomers to the series include funnyman Fred Willard as Michelle's father, and beautiful January Jones as Cadence, Michelle's younger sister. Anyone who is worried that the nice, romantic wedding storyline will overshadow the raunch and comedy of the previous two films, will be happy to know that the raunch, sex, nudity, and everything else is still predoominant in the film. It isn't as raunchy as part 2, but it definitley delivers. Scott, as Stifler, is practically the star of the movie, as it seems that the movie focuses a lot more on him than on Jim and Michelle. Sean seems to overdo Stifler way too much this time. It is evident right from the start that he going overboard, and it appears that it isn't so much a Stifler performance, than a Stifler caricature, as so many others have said. Thomas Ian Nicholas as Kevin, must of had nothing else to do. Why else would he appear in a film that barely registers that he's there?. His role is so transparent, that I can't figure out what they were trying to do with him. The direction of the film is a bit off too. There seems to be scenes that might of gone on longer, but were obviously cut short. Some shots cut away to something real quickly and is given the impression that there was more there. Jesse Dylan, the director and, Bob's son, didn't seem to be a great choice, and his work shows that someone else would of been better. The heart of the first film isn't as well done here either. It was a tad shakey in the sequel too, but there's more here than in 2. The acting is as solid and believeable, minus Stifler, as it always has been. I still believe Hannigan to be a wonder. She has come a long way from that flute tuting band dork from the original. Biggs is still a likeable hero, because he is an every-guy type of person. And Levy, well, Levy is just a god. The film is filled with some definite laugh out loud moments, and some nice scene with Jim and Michelle, but it didn't quite hit the bullseye like the original. Part 2 was better, because it felt more like a 'Pie' film. Namely because everyone was there. The raunch is there, the comedy is there, and the sweetness is felt more than the sequel. It's not great art, but it isn't trying to be. This is for the fans and for the people who enjoy these movies. They really won't be disappointed, even though it isn't the same.

1497555,3,B00005JMCT,"This series of three films has one thing going for it that none of the other so-called teen comedies has...a Heart: particularly in the relationship between Jim (Jason Biggs) and his father (Eugene Levy).
""American Wedding"" finds Jim about to be married to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and even though the actual wedding preparations are kind of a bore, Stickler manages to save the day especially in the scene, set in a gay bar, in which he duel dances with a big hearty fellow known as Bear.

Outside of that complaint (which I could not get rid of the entire movie) this movie is absolutely hilarious!! From the opening ""under the table"" scene to Stifler and his ""chocolate truffle"" this movie is filled with more of the gross humor that so many (myself included) love. This movie, like the previous one, also has a great deal of heart. Michelle is more of a background character, but she still has her moments (like talking to Jim's dad before the ceremony). Jim seems to grow out of his clumsiness as the movie goes on. Even Stiffler (who steals the show again!!!) grows up a little and shows even he has a heart. Disapointing about Oz and the other missing characters, but that still does not keep me from giving this movie 5 stars. American Pie 2 is one of my favorite movies of all time; this one lives up to those standards wonderfully.",1061337600,,1118,4.512315270935961
1497557,4,B00005JMCT,"I must say that while I am very satisfied with how they ended this series, I am a little sad to see Jim (Jason Biggs), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), and the gang leaving. Unlike most teen movies, the American Pie series actually gets you to care for the characters.  I feel a slight connection to these characters. For example, I want to see Michelle again. The character, who has grown from a mere punch line into a frontman, is hilarious not to mention beautiful. When I heard that Alyson Hannigan was getting married in real life, I was a little sad (darn you Alexis Denisof), but it's not like I have a chance or anything. Also, Jim and Michelle are, in this way only, like my parents: my mom is Irish Roman-Catholic while my father is Jewish. Anyway, the movie follows the continuing exploits of Jim and Michelle before their wedding. They want the wedding to be perfect so they naturally choose NOT to invite Stifler (Seann William Scott), but he eventually is able to wrangle himself into the ceremony. Like Michelle, Stifler has grown in importance. In the first movie, he was a supporting character; he wasn't part of the group or the pact. In the second movie, the gang didn't want him at the beach house, but they needed him. In this one, they don't want him at the wedding, but he actually is the unofficial star of the movie. He and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are both vying for Michelle's hot (but nowhere near as beautiful as Alyson) Cadence (January Jones) and they actually switch personalities; Stifler becomes cultured and polite (only in front of the Flaherty family) while Finch becomes the rude ""Finchmeister"". Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) doesn't have much to do besides add a little support to Jim. The film could have been done without him. I'm not saying that it should have been done without him, I'm just saying that it could have. I wanted the entire gang back, but I'll elaborate later. Meanwhile, Jim is trying hard to impress Michelle's parents while Michelle struggles to write her vows. As usual, laughs are inevitable while the characters struggle to achieve their separate goals: there is Stifler with the bachelor party, Jim and his nervousness, Michelle's dirty nature, and Finch's strange knowledge. If you liked the first two movies, you owe it to yourself to see ""The Thrilling Climax"". However, not everyone in the group decided to be a part of that climax. The one that I'm most surprised about is Oz (Chris Klein). He was part of the main group, something that Stifler was not. He was one of Jim's best friends and he wasn't even mentioned throughout the film. Also, he is a good counter-balance to Stifler: they are both popular jocks, but Oz is sensitive while Stifler is crass. Now if you have Oz, you have to have Heather. After all, the two are in love. If Heather was cut first, I can see why Oz wasn't there, but I don't understand why anyone was cut. Next is Vicky and Jessica. They are a pair, and while Vicky wouldn't have too much to do, Jessica (who would have Vicky with her for the ride) would be able to give advice to Jim and Michelle. Finally, there is Nadia, the only member of the lost gang who was even mentioned. I can understand why she was cut the most, however, she could have created some conflict for the two lovebirds. Before I wrap up this review, I must say this: be warned: there is a scene in this movie so disgusting that I almost threw up in the theater. I have never in my life come that close to barfing due to a movie in my life. So in conclusion,... It's like Michelle says in American Pie 2; you can't be too uptight. It causes problems. Enjoy this last piece of pie.",1061251200,4,3645,4.53951367781155
1497558,3,B00005JMCT,"For fans or the notoriously raunchy ""American Pie"" series, a certain amount of doubts arise when considering whether or not to see this, the third insallment in the series.  Considering that the second movie was a definite step back from the first, it would be only logical that the next sequel would be even less funny.  Add that to the fact that half of the original cast is missing from this one and things don't look good from the start.  The result though, is very different from what one would expect when following this line of thinking.
Somehow, the creators of the ""American Pie"" series were able to dig deep and wrench the last few satisfying drops of comedy from this franchise...with of course one catch.  You will enjoy this movie if you are a fan of the character of Stifler.  Despite the wedding based theme, he is the true main event and the star of the show.  Of course we still have the embarrassing situations that Jim manages to get himself into, the uncomfortable fatherly advice of Jim's dad, and the pseudo intellectual posturing of Finch, but through it all Seann William Scott's Stifler character is front and center and makes the most of it.  With the exception of the very funny opeing scene, Stifler is involved in all of the funniest moments that ""American Wedding"" has to offer, and there are quite a few of them.
""American Wedding"" isn't quite equal to the original American Pie, but for fans of this series and this type of comedy, it will not dissapoint.  By the way, do not judge this movie by its preview, unlike just about every other comedy, ""American Wedding"" saves its funniest moments for the actual movie.",1061164800,,1646,4.651724137931034
1497559,5,B00005JMCT,"Most of the great characters from the American Pie series return for a great movie. Though Nadia, Vicky, Heather, Oz, Jessica, and Stifler's brother aren't in this one it is still a big win! There are some new faces such as Michelle's sister Cadence who is played by January Jones. If you loved American Pie and American Pie 2 you'll love American Wedding even more. So do your self a favor and go see American Wedding starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Seann William Scott, and January Jones.

1497560,4,B00005JMCT,"A Film by Jesse Dylan
I thought American Pie was funny.  I really didn't like American Pie 2 and thought it was mostly a waste of time.  For some reason I decided that I wanted to see the third (and presumably final) movie in this franchise: American Wedding.  Even more surprising is the fact that I enjoyed the movie and found it funny.
Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs) and Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan) are getting married.  Jim and Michelle first met in the first American Pie movie where Jim, unable to get a date for prom, asked band geek Michelle.  Michelle turned out to be a nympho-maniac and ended up being Jim's first sexual experience (and a one night stand).  In the second movie Jim turned to Michelle to help him gain confidence and experience with women so he could impress Nadia.  By the end of American Pie 2 Jim realized he really loved Michelle and they ended up together.  American Wedding opens with Jim proposing to Michelle and a disturbingly funny scene with Jim's father (Eugene Levy) bringing Jim the diamond ring which he forgot all the while Michelle is under the restaurant table (you can guess what she is doing).
Jim's friends Kevin Meyers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are helping Jim with wedding plans so that Michelle can have the wedding of her dreams (which Jim promised).  Early on in the movie they mention that the best thing about this wedding is that Stifler (Sean William Scott) will not be there.  Of course this means that Stifler will end up crashing the party.  Initially he believes he is crashing a graduation party (Jim and friends are just graduating from college), but instead it is the engagement party.  While Jim, Kevin and Finch have matured somewhat since American Pie 2, Stifler is exactly the same foul, crude, loudmouthed guy he has been since the first movie.
Instead of being the same old same old that we got from American Pie 2, American Wedding actually shows growth in the story as well as in the characters (I can't believe I just said that).  Yes, Jim is still bumbling, but he means well and truly loves Michelle and it feels like Jim has actually grown as a person.  He is more mature and willing to try to overcome his limitations as a person.  Kevin is not much more than window dressing and a familiar face.  Finch is finch, but it feels like he fits in with the group a lot more.  Amazingly enough, Steve Stifler grows the most as a character.  Stifler starts out as loud and obnoxious, but throughout the movie he starts to think more of others (in a Stifler sort of way) and tries to do the right thing.  He backslides and takes steps forwards, and in the end is a better person than when he started in the movie.
Yes, there is some of the gross out humor that was such a big part of the first two movies, but there is less of it.  There are a couple of scenes that fit perfectly into the other movies as a gross out scene, but as a whole, American Wedding is less crude than American Pie or American Pie 2.  The focus truly is on relationships: the friendship of Jim, Kevin, and Finch; the family relationships of the Levinsteins and the Flaherty's; Jim and Michelle; Stifler trying to get with Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones); Stifler trying to be a better friend.  The story is told with a lot of humor and some crudeness, but ultimately American Wedding is a gentler movie than either of the American Pie movies.
Oddly enough, there was no mention of the missing characters.  While it was appropriate that the women (except for Michelle) were not in the movie (they were pretty much all ex-girlfriends and former lust interests, there was no mention of Oz.  Oz was part of Jim's circle of friends and while after three years of college friends do drift apart, you would think that Oz would merit a throwaway line for continuity's sake.  After all, the movie did reference Nadia.  This isn't something that should bother anyone during the movie, but it was something that I thought of after the movie was over.
Note: There is quite a bit of foul language, sexual humor, gross out humor, and other stuff that would be inappropriate for younger viewers or other viewers.  Stifler drops the F-Bomb repeatedly.  My advice is to know what you are getting into to.
The bottom line is that American Wedding is a funny movie.  It marks an improvement in the series, and it feels like one more trip with old friends (exactly how these guys became my friends is a question I'm going to leave unanswered).  I'm surprised to say this, but I liked the movie, and because of the content I will give it a qualified recommendation.",1060646400,2,4642,4.577992744860943

I have seen the movie twice and I honestly believe that it is the best American Pie movie out of the raunchy trilogy. The movie is very funny, but it will probably only be funny for those that liked the first two because well, it does get pretty raunchy. What's different about this movie compared to movies like Porky's and Fast Times at Ridgemont High is that it has a lot of heart. These are actually characters that one can really care about and that makes the experience even more enjoyable. There a couple new characters that you are boumd to love including a woman named Candace and Bear.

1497652,4,B00005JMCT,"I was not really looking forward to this movie given all the horrible reviews I've read in the newspapers, Entertainment Weekly, etc.  While watching the movie, I was shocked at how funny it was.  It was almost as funny as the first one.  I don't know what the ""professional"" reviewers were thinking when they panned the movie, other than figuring that my friend who I saw the movie with was right when he said, ""Movies for young people shouldn't be reviewed by old men.""  I have to say I agree.  Not only does this third installment offer the requisite hilariously gross Stiffler scene (kudos to Sean William Scott for doing whatever the directors/writers ask of him every time out), but there are several great scenes in which Stiffler and Finch pretty much trade  personalities.  Sean William Scott gets 90% of the laughs.  I hope they spin off this character into a movie or two of his own.  Thomas Ian Nichols doesn't really do much as Kevin (which is too bad, because he's a good actor in his own right), but Eugene Levy and Fred Willard do their always hilarious performances.

I wasn't that excited about it because I thought that it would be impossible to top, let alone, compare to the first and second. This movie was not as good as the second(my favorite of the series), though it lives up to it's predecesors(I'm a bad speller). The movie was crudely disgusting like the others(never said that was a bad thing).  The movie had very few moments where I wasn't laughing my (butt)off, but only because they were working up to a joke and because it needed to be serious at a couple times.  Most of the characters are back which surprised me for I had heard that only Stiffler, Jim, Jim's Dad, and Michelle were going to be the only returning characters; Finch, Kevin, and Stiffler's Mom(for a few minutes) returned for the movie. I was disapointed to hear that Vicki and Oz didn't return.  Though some new characters were added for only this movie like Michelle's parents and sister.
  Now to give you the idea of the movie, which is not really given during the trailers.  The movie was ofcourse about Jim proposing to Michelle, but is placed from the proposal through the wedding. It is placed after college, showing where everyone is in life(the movie is not based on it, the movie just tells where everyone is at the moment the goes on). During the movie Finch and Stiffler fight over Michelle's beautiful and intelligent younger sister, going extremely far to try to get her.
  I feel that this movie was probably the best 3rd movie of a trilogy considering it is very hard to make a sequel to a sequel good without being repetative of the first 2.  Thank you for reading my review and I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.",1059782400,,1756,4.445482866043614

  AW(dealing with the wedding between newly college grads Jim & Michelle), most likely the last in the trilogy,is not entirely fresh,but still manages to make you laugh and smile. Steven Stifler(Sean William Scott, who basically steals the movie)rates high on the obnoxious meter,but you still have to love the guy as even he grows up towards the end of the movie.
  Jason Biggs' Jim Levenstien(one day a pop culture icon for geeks)still knows how to get into a crazy situation(The opening dinner scene,his pre wedding ""haircut""),and Alyson Hannigan's Michelle shows how a one time flute-toting band geek can blossom into a beautiful young woman.

I didn't really expect much because sequels usually aren't as great as their predecessors, but I ended up enjoying this one anyway. I found myself (and the entire crowd) laughing at most of the scenes, laughing so hard that it would be difficult to hear what they were saying during most scenes. Most of the comedy is pretty gross and sexual, which surprised me as to seeing many children under 15 with their parents/guardians were watching this movie together and actually seeing that these kids were laughing at these jokes. I would advise parents who want what's best for their children to leave them at home, or well, they'll find a way to watch it with their friends anyway.
Although Jim and the gang are back, there are a few cast members missing, such as Chris Klein, Mena Suvari, and Tara Reid just to name a few, but those that decided to film the last Pie certainly made it worth my time and money.

Seann William Scott as ""Stifler"" seemed like he was really trying to force it even though he largely plays the same character in every movie. There were some funny moments, but there were also some gross-out moments that were meant to be funny, but didn't work. I just wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I really enjoyed the others.",1059696000,,549,4.5
1497791,4,B00005JMCT,"Hey, while it might be full of [toilet] humor many people might find offensive, AMERICAN WEDDING is just hilarious.  I don't think I stopped laughing throughout the whole thing.  Many of the film's jokes build on humorous moments from the two AMERICAN PIE movies, but that's okay.  There's loads of fun in this installment surrounding the impending wedding of the nymphomaniac ""Band Camp"" girl, Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), and the friend-to-home-baked-goods ne'er-do-well, Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs).  The movie isn't so much about Jim and Michelle, though.  Seann William Scott steals the show (again?) as wild party boy Stifler, and Hannigan's character ends up being little more than a prop.  Still, the film has a heart, and there are a few touching moments (even though they might make some folk cringe a bit ;).
One hilarious moment is when Stifler accidently wanders into a gay bar and sets out to prove that he's appealing even to gay men by showcasing his dance moves to a collage of 80s dance tracks!  Another great scene senters around the mis-aptly scheduled ""bachelor party.""  Once again, the AMERICAN WEDDING franchise proves that it is the modern leader in sexual/toilet humor, but manages to tell a story in such a way as the humor appears simply part of life (well, isn't it, then?)  There's more laughs to go around than you can shake a stick at!",1059696000,3,1375,4.943478260869565
1497792,4,B00005JMCT,"I've read some of the reviews the critics give this movie, and I see things a bit differently. This movie like the other ""American Pie"" movies does what its meant to do, be funny in a crude way. I don't think it was intend to be educational, or be a serious movie that will earn them academy awards. And that's what the critics seem to compare movies too.
Some critics have said, ""The jokes are unemotional, uncouth and mostly unfunny."" I disagree, good thing we all have our own opinions. I thought this movie was just as funny as the first two American Pies. There are certain things we expect already before watching this movie, such as Jim being clumsy and always finding ways to embarrass himself (I think that's funny).
""Disposable as toilet paper, 'American Wedding' raises the question of how far mainstream the gross-out comedy can go."" Disagree; this movie is a make-you-feel-good movie. The main plot of the movie revolves around the wedding and everything some people go through when getting married, and the movie delivers on all that you might expect an American Wedding to be. Furthermore, the mainstream audience that watches mainstream movies might enjoy this much more than the out-of-it-I-don't-know-what-the-public-really-likes critic.
""By this stage, though, the whole exercise is so dragged out and watered down, it's essentially a series of gross-out gags with bits of dialogue tying them together."" I think what this critic is missing is that, that's what the public wants. We, the public, do not watch American Pies for educational rewards. We want to be grossed out; we want to see our favorite actors/actresses in situations that we hope we're never in. I say give us more!
There you have it, the other side of the coin. I enjoyed it and I will recommend it. Everyone out there will make up his or her own minds. Be assured though, everything that made up the pervious American Pies is consistent with this American Wedding. (Except some of the cast).

1497793,5,B00005JMCT,"I saw this movie on it's first showing, and I have to say, if it wasn't the best out of the three, it was pretty close. Jesse Dylan's direstion of this movie was excellent. I don't even need to tell how good the actor/actresses were in this movie, as well as the others. And to end this, I think the series ended the way it should, but I just hope that no one gets the smart idea to make a fourth. It takes to much risk at ruining the series they had going.",1059696000,,457,3.924731182795699
1497794,5,B00005JMCT,"I've always been a fan of the Pie series, even though I didn't find them ungodly funny, I've always found them to be funny enough for multiple viewings, if I were to review the previous 2 I'd give them at best 4 stars.  American Wedding by far exceeds the previous 2, which is very odd in a trilogy.  One of the things that makes it far superior is that it's even more vulgar and more unafraid to cross the line a few miles, which it does over and over again, and the great thing about it is it works very well.  However, the best thing about Pie 3 is one of the funniest characters created Steve Stiffer takes the movie over and steals the show, every other character in the film is shadowed over the laughs Stiffer brings cause he doesn't have to do much to get a laugh out of me.  I'll just leave it at that, if you love Stiffler this movie is for you.  I'll leave plot points out so not to spoil the comedy.",1059609600,,911,4.095505617977528
