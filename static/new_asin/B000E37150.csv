8104822,5,B000E37150,"This DVD, part of the ""Automobiles"" series on the History Channel, is not only about the legendary 911, but also about the story of Porsche automobiles.

Of the DVD's 50 minutes, about 20 minutes covers the founder, Dr. Ferdinand Porsche, as well as his involvement in designing what would become the Volkswagen Beetle during the 1930's, the first postwar Porsche sportscars and the cars that led to the development of the 911.

The balance of the video covers the 911 in it's many forms, early to modern. It covers engine development, Porsche racing teams, the tradition of the hand-built sportscar, the turbo models, the Carrera's, the Targa's as well as how the Porsche sportscars compared to similar cars of the era.

I thought it was an excellent video and give it five stars since I knew it wasn't exclusively about the 911 (having watched the episode on the History Channel). Caveat emptor - if you are looking for a DVD only about the 911...this isn't it. Still, very entertaining and a good DVD for car buffs.",1331856000,3,1018,4.7727272727272725
8104823,4,B000E37150,"with only 30 mins of the history of the 911, it seemed a bit short and same old - same old. At the end they talk about the ALL NEW 996 that will change the world, etc - yeah right! it was more like a sales pitch.

the best stuff is in the extras where there is about 5 clips (about 5-10mins each) from early (70's) LeMans racing, African rally, James Dean, 917's at Nurburgring and something else i can't remember. good buy with that stuff, otherwsie would have been pretty boring if you know all the history already.",1213488000,8,517,4.222222222222222
