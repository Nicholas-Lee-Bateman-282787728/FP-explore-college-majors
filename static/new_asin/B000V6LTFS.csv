8216807,1,B000V6LTFS,"I think the Director's Oswald story is pure, bogus cold-war propaganda. Should we believe his claim Oswald needed a Russian language tutor? The U.S.Marines taught LHO to speak Russian. See his Marine Corp file. Marina Oswald testified to the Warren Comm. that he spoke Russian so well that she thought he was a real Russian. I noticed the Director didn't interview Marina. Could it be because today she says she was forced to implicate Oswald in theJFK assassination by US  government agents who told her she would be deported back to Russia if she didn't  co-operate. Why does the Director think that LHO's Russian ""friends"" were just ordinary people? All or some of them could easily be KGB agents there to keep an eye on him. Are we really supposed to believe that the KGB did not place a ""friend"" close to LHO to find out the real reason why he defected? The whole DVD story sounds like an elaborate cover story(agreed to by both governments) to absolve them both of any involvement in the death of JFK.",1429833600,,1007,4.651685393258427
8216808,4,B000V6LTFS,"While of course not providing a definitive answer as to who fatally shot the nation's 35th president, this DVD does provide an interesting backdrop as to how Oswald found himself in the former USSR and ultimately looking down the scope of an Italian-made rifle to cause the nation's 4th assassination of a president.......or did he?",1357948800,,332,5.054545454545455
