5559516,1,B00B62ER0U,I found the plots uninteresting and too much gore.  This definitely does not meet the quality of other foreign detective series.  Also Amazon does not allow you to trade it in as their trade in department only allows it for trade in if it is blueray.,1372809600,2,250,4.413043478260869
5559517,5,B00B62ER0U,Every episode is complicated and intriguing. Acting is superb. This is the first time I've ever watched a Finnish series and I'm impressed by this detective story.,1370649600,10,163,5.074074074074074
5559518,5,B00B62ER0U,"Jussi doesn't buy into BS from either end of the spectrum. He may look like a drowned rat, but he's one cool dude. And just when I think I have him pinned (wriggling on the wall) he does something dumber or smarter than he should. If you've noticed that every single crime show of the past 20 years features cops (since when are they the good guys?) and miss (or missed) the private eyes (scum of the earth--Jussi even tails adulterers now and then), Vares is the antidote (no pun intended--if you watch the series you will understand). Weird, wild, dark--and definitely for adults only. If the novels (and the movies) are this good, I need to take them in as well. Definitely not just another Nordic thriller series.",1370131200,12,717,4.565891472868217
8563138,3,B00B62ER0U,"This is kind of old school detective noir...if you like the genre, you'll probably like this. It's subtitled(and they are clear and seem fairly accurate).
 Some not so subtle humor (a recovering drug addict, whose name is Antidote !), and some interesting subtle clues.  It's not rocket science or
supremely clever, a dash of outlandish noir....but entertaining and worth a watch.",1483488000,,380,5.213114754098361
8563139,5,B00B62ER0U,"Ah, the Finns - what a wonderful and enigmatic group.
A lot of sex and booze - and sisu!
Enjoyed this",1448928000,,101,3.857142857142857
8563140,1,B00B62ER0U,"Finnish? Thank God it did finish. I'm not sure how long I could have watched this
video travesty. Three Discs. Oy!!
I slogged through the first and reflection on my life so far found that I did not deserve to watch the two in the wings.
Bad? Boy Howdy. What trash. When you cheer for the bad guys you know something is afoot.

8563141,5,B00B62ER0U,"The Scandinavian ""Mystery"" genre is amazing. There are astonishingly
good series that come out of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.
""Private Eye Vares"" is one of them. And it is one of the best. A number
of ""movies"" in this series were made starting in 2011 (they're hard to
find on IMDb; look for them under lead actor Antti Reini; someone else
played Vares prior to Reini -- I've not seen those). A new movie is in
the works, apparently, as I write this in 2014.

These are very, very noir, very hard-boiled, down to the Sam Spade-like
voice-over in first-person narrative (is it me? I could listen to the
sound of Antti Reini's voice endlessly -- although I don't understand a
word of Finnish). It's a modern-day Dashiell Hammett. But there is also
a lot of humor here, and the humor translates well for the
English-speaking audience. There's really nothing more fun to watch
than Antti Reini as Jussi Vares. But let's not stop there, all the
actors -- all the characters -- are wonderful. Jussi's band of brothers
includes a former pastor who now owns a bookstore (Pastori Alanen,
played by Matti Onnismaa), a writer of bad fiction novels (Juhani
Luusalmi, played by Eppu Salminen), a tabloid journalist (Ruuhio,
played by Mikko Leppilampi), and a police homicide investigator
(Komisario Markku Hautavainio, played by Ilkka Heiskanen). They're
mostly a group of adorable, loyal, well-meaning, and clever, if scuzzy,
drunks. I especially enjoy Inspector Hautavainio.

Other equally captivating characters come and go... like Anna (played
by Maria J&auml;rvenhelmi), she's Jussi's neighbor -- a taxi driver by day,
a pole dancer at night. And let's not forget ""Antidote"" (played by the
wonderful Jasper P&auml;&auml;kk&ouml;nen) -- who seems like a creepy, small-time
crook, but is still sympathetically appealing.. and maybe not as bad as
he seems.

The stories are complicated, challenging, and often surprising. I'll be
up front that they can be quite violent. But Reini is so endearing as
the lead character, I put up with the brutality. Vares is tough, but
sweet (he loves cats!), and smart... He's so very smart. And... let's
face it... he's incredibly sexy. He seems like a winner, but has a
whiff of a loser about him. His relationships don't seem to last. So
he's complicated and ambiguous. And maybe not the kind of guy you
really want to bring home. Or... maybe he is....

It's a dark world that Vares and his pals occupy. But they are fun to
watch!

And the music! The music is amazing, in movie after movie it
mesmerizes. I especially enjoyed the soundtracks in Tango of Darkness
and The Path of Righteous Men. Who would've known the Finnish are gaga
for Tango?

Thanks to MHz Worldview International Mystery for airing these. And
making them available on DVD.

8563142,1,B00B62ER0U,"after seeing a preview on another dvd, i thought it looked pretty interesting. got my library to order it. well to say i was disappointed is putting it mildly. dull, uninspired both in acting and writing. am fan of foreign detectives, montalbano, anna huss, falcon etc, but this was just plain dull. i walked away not caring about these characters. took me 2 week to watch 6 episodes",1415577600,,383,4.647058823529412
8563143,4,B00B62ER0U,"There is so much to learn about the psychology and customs of People in Finland especially that the action does not take place in Helsinki but in small village.
I liked the acting and after the first series, when I got familiarized with the atmosphere and the character everything became more interesting and enjoyable.",1397001600,,319,4.925925925925926
8563144,3,B00B62ER0U,"I'll admit it first, as a bit of a disclaimer. We got hooked on Borgen (not Nordic Noir but made by Danmarks Radio which made The Killing) and loved the American version of The Killing. That led us to track down the original Danish version of The Killing, Forbrydelsen, and to broaden our search to find more Nordic Noir. We of course found The Bridge (again, Danish version) and we were hungry for more.

Vares was one of the ones we picked up, more because it was ""related"" and less because we checked reviews and the like. As a result, we've sort of learned that not all Nordic Noir is created equal (it's not that bad).

With Vares, we've got the Finnish entry to the Nordic Noir field. Vares is a private eye and the character plays out like a pretty typical one as well: scraping the bottom of the barrel to make ends meet, taking on cases that sometimes start as your typical domestic flavor case only to having him stumble into something bigger.

Vares himself hangs out in a pub with friends and is tapped into the various parts of the underworld of the city of Turku. Each episode is effectively a movie (usually running about 1.5 hours) and follows a case or set of cases that are related.

You've got all the usual trappings of a cliched private detective novel here. There's a voiceover, the PI is hard on his luck, etc. You start to expect him to call women ""dames"" next. Still, and maybe this is just a personal thing for me, there's something about watching a procedural set in a city in a different country with a different language and culture permeating all aspects of the drama.  Even so, while we generally enjoyed the episodes, by the last one, we weren't quite as enamored as we were with the DR dramas.

Maybe it's just the character isn't really special (he's smart but he's also lucky) or the production values are a bit meager (not terribly but there are times you feel like a better director might have made a much better episode). Something about the series just doesn't pull it above the above average mark. Like I said, if you're desperate for the genre and really like the idea of watching these Scandinavian dramas, you'll likely enjoy it well enough.

At the same time, I feel like we've sort of been ruined by the DR dramas. A combination of slick production values, great writing and stories, and most important of all great characters you can connect with really bring those dramas to the fore...and raise bar against which these others can't help but be compared against.

So, if you're looking for another The Killing or The Bridge, I'm afraid you won't find it here. But, if you enjoyed Irene Huss, for instance, or you like the rough and tumble PI type, I think you'll find something here to enjoy.

By the way, from what I've seen, there are six episodes released (these and another set of three). There's an older series (this is effectively a remake) from 2004 that's different (it's actually a standalone movie if I recall correctly). I think they'd wanted to bring back the actor from the first one but they couldn't so they brought in Antti Reini who does just fine.",1393459200,5,3113,4.544642857142857
8563145,1,B00B62ER0U,"Dull and cliched, the series revolves around Vares and his empty headed friends.  They are stupifyingly misogynistic and remarkably dim. Their sexism is tedious, and their complete lack of ethics make them an unsympathetic crew.  Vares is rather more appealing but it's a world of the basest values, where recreation means alcohol, violence is the norm and fanatical vengefulness is commonplace.  Distasteful.  Not on a par with the many excellent Scandinavian dramas offered.  Cartoonish.",1393027200,4,489,5.554054054054054
8563146,5,B00B62ER0U,After watching several outstanding series with sub titles I did not expect to enjoy this series as much as I did.  It took a few episodes for me to really get into the character of Vares but once I did I really enjoyed this series.  Well acted and the plots were interesting.,1384473600,2,275,4.269230769230769
8563147,4,B00B62ER0U,"This series took a little getting used to and, in fact, if I could find a three and a half rating I would apply it. However, I have erred on the side of liking it. If you are looking for ""neat and tidy"" plots, go back to the ""Midsomer Murders !!"" This is definitely not for those who like to walk and chew gum at the same time as one has to pay attention ! The episodes are somewhat convoluted, but eventually come together satisfactorily. As far as the character of PI Vares is concerned, I at first did not like him, but came to realize that the whole series is ""different"" as is the main character. His connections in his town are definitely in tune with his personality !! Will buy the next episodes and would recommend the series as worth a try.",1374192000,7,750,4.215277777777778
