The concept was intriguing, but it was not well executed. I know it was an award-winner, so clearly this puts me in a category all my own, but I was not engaged.",1388707200,,289,4.178571428571429
8327167,4,B001NJ9152,"I'm Lebanese American and lost a lot of my Arabic when my father went back to Lebanon.  I was looking for Arabic movies with English subtitles to watch and get used to the dialogue again. This movie surprised me. The storyline is really good and it's a sweet love.  However translating the words to English, I can understand why the previous person who wrote their review didn't give the best reveiw.  You will have to understand the culture to truely understand this story. It's so realistic on so many levels.  I love Lebanon, and I vist my family a lot.  Watching this movie kind of brings you into reality - how good we have it here in America. I really recommend this movie to those that love the language and the culture and understand it fully.",1342569600,5,751,4.492647058823529
8327168,2,B001NJ9152,"A subtitled Lebanese movie that may attract those with an interest in Middle East politics, customs and mores. A mix of serious drama, comedy and surreal interpretation that really doesn't seem to have much in the way of mainstream viewer appeal.  More of a specialized niche film.",1256860800,2,281,4.9787234042553195
