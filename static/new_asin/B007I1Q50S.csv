5087460,5,B007I1Q50S,"With very few caveats, I would say this version of ""Twelfth Night"" is a superior version of Shakespeare's play than the TV film starring Alec Guinness, Joan Plowright, Ralph Richardson, and Tommy Steele. The biggest difference is with Richard Briars' performance as Malvolio. He outdoes Sir Alec at virtually every turn. The role of the fool / minstrel Feste is much closer to what Shakespeare intended than the Tommy Steele rendition.

By far the best aspect of this version is that the confusion between Viola, disguised as a man, and Sebastian, her thought to be lost brother, is far better realized, and the outcome of the nasty joke played on Malvolio is more properly resolved.

The one area where I would credit the all star cast is with Ralph Richardson's portrayal of Sir Toby Belch. His characterization is helped by the fact that the setting is in Shakespeare's Renaissance world rather than the 19th century era of Branagh's production. I suspect that Joan Plowright also does an excellent job, but something is lost because we don't notice the confusion between brother and disguised sister.

The setting is a bit contrived, based on the fact that Shakespeare wrote it around Christmas, and the setting is outside, in the snow, with a decorated Christmas tree. Unlike ""As You Like It"", this play would not benefit from a naturalistic setting. The Stage of the Globe would probably work just fine.",1376265600,13,1409,4.936708860759493

8517018,3,B007I1Q50S,"Both of these are Thames Television productions, which is to say that they are British television. The screen resolution is below HD but above American standard definition (thankfully). The problem is that they are early, heavy-handed Kenneth Brannaugh productions. The Twelfth Night, in particular, is very, very troublesome. For some strange reason, the director decided to have a single melody for every song, and it is a sort of late-80's British pop melody. ALL the songs and ALL the incidental music is this . . . thing. It is as if Brannaugh had T. S. Eliot's use of the opening of Twelfth Night so much in mind that he put on the play to get to it (that music again!). He bludgeons us with the tune, whether it fits the lyric or mood or not. The actresses do their best, although they're not of the right ages. The Duke is unattractive and uninteresting, when the text calls for him to be at least one of them. The madcaps are played to type, and Malvolio almost works, except that we feel sorry for him. This is affordable, and it is the text, but it is theatrical and troubled.",1526688000,,1087,4.522842639593908

Twelfth Night (2005, DVD) is Kenneth Branagh's production of the play Shakespeare presented at court for the winter holidays. ""Twelfth Night"" refers to the evening of the 12th day of Christmas (which is the eve of Epiphany, the feast of the Three Kings), and it was a time for all kinds of merry-making, including the Tom-Foolery with which this play abounds. Branagh tries to bring out the Christmas aspects of the play by casting it in a Dickension setting, reminiscent of some productions of ""A Christmas Carol."" Despite this, and the prominence of a Christmas tree in the courtyard, I did not realize much of a Christmas ""feel."" This is because, as Branagh states in the commentary that accompanies this production, he sought to bring out the serious or tragic aspects of each of the characters: the shipwreck which leaves the twins thinking that his/her sibling is drowned; the continuing insecurity that leads Olivia to dress as a man; her unrequited love as she is sent by her master to woo another; Sir Toby's exploitation of the young man he has brought to woo his niece, the servants of the duchess whose ire is taken out in the humiliation of Malvolio, the consternation of the twins' friends as they are each mistaken and denied help at critical moments. Lingering on these matters does not leave us light-hearted, what we'd expect of a light-hearted comedy. Furthermore, the pacing that allows us to think on these less-than-happy aspects also causes this production to seem a little long. Here we are up against the Elizabethan expectation versus a television-shaped taste for sound bites and rapid scene changes. Even so, I think it may have been better to move more quickly through the sadder aspects to emphasize the humor.
All the same, this is a pretty decent production. It was originally a stage-play which was filmed, so there are limitations as to scenery, etc. But the camera makes good use of close-ups without eclipsing the sense of staging. All characters are played sympathetically, including Malvolio. One difficulty which several Shakespeare productions face is the difficulty of an actress playing the woman-dressed-as-man in a convincing manner.
I confess that I enjoyed the Helen Bonham Carter version of this play better. Carter looked great as the duchess and the actress playing Olivia was at once a more convincing and a more laughable character. That version of the play was not as ""complete"" making it a better evening's entertainment while Branagh's came closer to a two evening's study. As with all great writing, whether Shakespeare or the Bible, the more time you invest, the more rewarding the material. I had to have Branagh's version either way.",1524009600,,2741,4.99562363238512

8517022,3,B007I1Q50S,"This review only covers Twelfth Night. I was disappointed. First, I was put off by the scenes in snow. Who delivers a soliloquy about love while standing in pelting snow? Ridiculous! Also, the actors manage to avoid almost all opportunities to be funny where funny is due, mostly to bad timing. In general, the timing of most lines is too slow. Also, there is nothing in Shakespeare's play to indicate that Feste the Fool is a drunkard, in fact quite the reverse--he is meant to be the only sane character. Not here however. Aguecheek is meant to be a derelict old and foolish drunk, but here he is a handsome young man, very miscast. Finally, the 2 characters who do not fare well at the end are so upset and sad, and such a downer, that one would think that their fate was the purpose of the play, instead of it being a comedy.",1511568000,,829,4.3896103896103895
