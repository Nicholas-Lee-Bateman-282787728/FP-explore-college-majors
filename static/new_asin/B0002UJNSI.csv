8032008,1,B0002UJNSI,"I only purchased this DVD because I needed an extra dollar on my order to take advantage of the free shipping.  Since there is no description of the DVD, I thought I would provide one for others looking for that extra buck they need to spend for the free shipping.

This DVD is eight episodes of the three stooges CARTOONS.  Judging by the thin cardboard cover, the quality is very poor.  Looks like someone sat there with an old camera, took a picture or two of some scenes that were playing on an old color TV, scanned them into a PC, and printed them on a box.  I just tossed the DVD out, so I can't tell you if the quality is what I think it is.  It's basically something you will see at a dollar store.

If you are looking for some three stooges episodes, this aint them.  If you need an extra dollar to take advantage of the free shipping, go for it.  Who knows, maybe some kids would be interested in it.",1130716800,11,911,4.16
